    "text": "Maybe I should come here at night, get a tee up on a top floor and be on a date but this just wasn't a great time for me. I don't like the fact you can't make a time reservation without money commitment. The hour plus wait to start playing just wasn't worth it. I did like their beer selection and their appetizers were decent (but nothing I would order again). We had the fried pickles, queso with guacamole chips, flatbreads (steak and buffalo) and ice cream cookie. The best app was the buffalo flatbread, the rest were anticlimactic. The service was good but I just felt bored with the golf concept. At the end of the day you are still golfing so if you don't love golfing (I actually do like it) this might not be a fun time for you. It reminded me of bowling where it's continual waiting and confusion on who's turn it is. Next time I think I will just sneak a 6 pack into the driving range and save myself the time and wait!",

    "text": "Visited this place last Saturday night for a friend's birthday party. Parking is a problem. At the entrance the staff was informative and helpful to get us on the path to golfing. After paying for the $5 membership we were put in a three hour wait list. (Get your membership online ahead of time or you'll kill 30 mins waiting in line.  To kill some of the time we sat on the third level at the outdoor restaurant /bar area.  Service here was abysmal; but the food was impressive and unexpectedly delicious.  Our waiter admittedly told us tonight was his last shift when we called the manager on duty over.  My girlfriend ordered brisket nachos an hour and a half ago and they never showed up. The manager on duty was careless and asked me \"You know this is a popular time, right?\".  He did comp us the nachos but was very unprofessional and cold. We saw him visiting other unhappy tables around us, so this wasn't an isolated incident.   The outdoor fans did have misters attached to them and were blowing when we initially sat down which made it bearable. Just before we ordered the misters were turned off and when asked why, the staff told us it was for \"safety reasons\".  Pro tip: Wear appropriate clothes for the warm atmosphere.  Three hours later our bay was ready. As soon as we got there the touchscreen control panel was broken.  We spend 30 minutes idle while the maintenance crew fixed it. It continued to be buggy throughout the night.   When we finally got to swing the clubs it turned out to be a fun night especially after they comped us an hour. Overall, I'd return but it would be during off-peak hours.",

Every time I needed something I had to hunt down my bay house because she was never around and never checked on anybody. Too bad you guys can't run a Topgolf like they do and Roseville.",

Needless to say, I dusted off my clubs and we were off.  (Quick tip: you are not allowed to bring in your drivers but you can check them at the desk if you forget to leave them at home.  They have clubs you can use there)  After checking in, we headed over to our bay and checked out the digs.  The bays are pretty cool in that they have places to secure your clubs and comfy sofas to relax on.  We looked at the available games and started working through them.  There are several styles of games you can play based on the different targets that are out on the range.  It can definitely test you and force you to work on your accuracy.  We had a couple of beers and played for a couple of hours.  I have not had the food yet but I have heard that it is pretty good.  For now, I am satisfied, I had fun, and I am excited to come again in the future.",

    "text": "When visiting my friends in Phoenix, we decided to come by to Top Golf. We've been here before multiple times prior to this visit and we've always had a pleasant experience. Recently (June 27th), we decided to stop by. It was around 6:50-7pm when we got to the location. When checking in downstairs to get our bay, we were told we would have to leave at 9 pm since we were under 21, which we were totally fine with considering 2 hours of golf is more than enough. We went upstairs to the third level and were given our bay with no wait time, which was great. We got there and started to play our game. About 10 minutes later our server, Luke, came by. He asked us our ages, and of course, since we were under the age of 21 we had to leave at a certain time. After discovering that we're 17, he said that he'll have to check if we're allowed to stay. We told him what we were told downstairs, but he was a bit uneasy. He left, and as he left, one of our members in our party picked up the menu and wanted to order some sodas and food. When Luke saw him reading the menu, he came by and snatched the menu from my friends' hand and said we aren't allowed to order food. He said you guys can't stay too long. These were his exact words, \"You're a liability, not a priority.\" What is that supposed to mean? We aren't like the other paying customers because we're 17? Keep in mind, it's not even 7:30 pm yet. However, he said that he'll take our drink orders. So, we kindly asked if we can have a couple sodas. It took him almost 20 minutes to bring us soda. After dropping off the soda at our table, it took him no longer than 3 minutes before he came back again shutting down our golf game and kicking us out. He came, covered the screen and said we had to leave. He told my other friend, \"I'm giving you one more chance to hit because I'm nice, otherwise you all need to leave.\" It wasn't even 8 pm. Not only was this handled unprofessionally, it was handled very rudely. Anyways, Luke ends up covering the screen, swipes his employee card, stops the game, and charges us for 30 minutes of gameplay. The way Luke was handling the situation looked like we had done something terrible and it was urgent for us to leave. He told us, \"The sodas are on the house.\" trying to be nice, I guess. At this point, it was very embarrassing because people were staring at us getting yelled at and kicked out for no reason. After leaving the bay, we went downstairs and demanded to speak to a manager. We explained everything to the manager and supposedly he went upstairs and had a \"long talk with Luke\" as we waited for him to come back. He did confirm with us that we had until 9 pm to play and offered for us to go back. After this terrible experience, we decided to leave and go to Dave and Buster's instead. The manager was very understanding and helped us, but the experience was beyond belief and totally unexpected. Next time I'm in Arizona, I don't think I'm going to be coming here again.",

We walked in and were immediately greeted and asked about our group and our day and if we've ever been there before, most of our group hadn't ever been before, so we got our lifetime players card(s) and again AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, or maybe just conversational skills, but everyone was smiling. We were brought up to our bays and our group divided up into two groups.  Our waiters name was Philip I believe and he was darling, and after some begging swung a club for us, the guy who brought us to our table, checked on is regularly too! if I remember correctly there were two guys that also stood out to our group that just completely exemplified amazing customer service and their names were Nico and Mitch- thank you for a wonderful night- you guys rock!",

We literally had to flag down the distracted guy and girl bartending by waving or calling out, which we would normally never do. But after waiting 15...20...30 minutes it was ridiculous. They were too busy chatting with their coworkers waiting for drinks to be made. Not to mention the both of them were so rude. Never a smile never a thank you...horrible attitudes. It wasn't busy it was past 11pm and they still sucked. The guy even forgot my drink and when I reminded him he rudely slammed the bottle down I'm shocked it didn't foam up. The games are always fun, location is well maintained, but the service is garbage.",

The system randomly froze and reset mid-play during our very first game, losing all stats/scores. Then the ball dispenser repeatedly quit working and required 7-8 resets by the wait staff and finally a long visit by maintenance with no resolution after. All in all, we lost at least an hour of gameplay. We were offered extended playtime but had dinner reservations to make. We were never offered a bay transfer.

Watch out as this is a True FEE and doesn't even go towards your game play. You just pay it, period. That was a bit disappointing.   Other than being way too expensive we actually had fun and would like to go again but will be very careful about what we spend there. Definitely a family friendly place but I can't imagine most families could afford it.",

This is a nice place to come and spend an hour or two having a cool drink and getting a bit of exercise, although you are very unlikely to burn off more than you consume.  As a very inexperienced, occasional golfer this place was just about right for me. They provide a set of clubs at each spot along with table and chairs, as well as a server to bring food and drinks.  I did find the setup a bit difficult to get used to, though, because normally at a driving range you are on flat ground, but here you are as many as three stories high so it's a bit hard to judge your hitting the ball because you are trying to hit targets that are below you.   Anyway, it was a fun hour or so, but I'm not sure if I would get used to the difference between there and a traditional driving range, but l do plan on trying it again sometime.",

Came to TopGolf for a company offsite and was totally blown away by its sheer size and awesomeness! Three humongous stories of driving range stations that would make any avid golfer drool with anticipation. I'm from Honolulu where we don't have anything remotely this cool in a PGA fanboy meets Vegas bottle service kind of way. I learned to golf a few years back so that I could play in a tournament and I've always been grateful that I at least know the basics. It was so much fun to hit the ball off the tee and watch the points rack up on the screen. Out of all the team building activities we've had, this is definitely my favorite because of the physical activity and fantastic food + drink. Even if you're not big into golf, it's cool to hang out and lounge on the couches while watching your teammates play.",

    "text": "I had heard of this place and checked it out while at Spring Training.  We first went there on Sunday night around 7PM. The wait for a bay was 1:45. So we went to the casino next door. However we got to see what the place looked like and checked it out with the intention of coming back Monday morning, assuming it would be less crowded.  We were right. Place opened at 9AM, we got there at 10:30AM and walked right in.  The four of us played for an hour and ordered some chicken and biscuit sliders and orange juice from the server. We had a lot of fun taking swings with the clubs they provided. It was like going bowling.  Because we went before noon we got the cheapest rate and paid about $60 total for the hour we played including the breakfast food and drinks we ordered. Then we left and went to a 1:00 baseball game in Mesa.   TopGolf was fun and I think we will be going back every time we are in Arizona for Spring Training. Good value!",

    "text": "The second most fun you can have with a pole in your hand....  But really, SO FUN! It's the perfect mix of leisure and adventure. The multi-level driving range is a good time for avid golfers as well as first timers (like myself). Plus there's food and alcohol, which is always a bonus.   HOW IT WORKS: Each player pays a one-time $5 membership fee and then just pay by the hour for your games (anywhere from $25-$45 per hour depending on the time of day--earlier=cheaper). You can have up to 10 people per golf bay (the hourly rate just applies once--not to each person). Golf clubs are provided (but you can always bring your own!). Once you get to your bay, just swing away and rack up points by landing your balls in the targets. Each ball has a tracker so the screen tells you exactly where it landed and keeps score.   BOTTOM LINE: Go. Drink. Play. Be merry.",

    "text": "This is the perfect place to go for any occasion if you're looking for food, drinks, and games (well of course, golf, but also shuffleboard, foosball, and a few TV games).   We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon and waited about an hour or so for our reservation. We grabbed drinks and food at the bar and also played a few games of shuffleboard and foosball! Definitely helped pass the time. I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Once at the driving range, anyone can join in on the fun - I have never done any sort of golfing besides mini golf and had a fantastic time. You can play a continuous game with your friends until the time runs out. Each hour cost is based on when you are there (cheaper for earlier, more expensive later). Seats were comfy wherever we were, lots of things to do, and heaters at every station in case it was cold like the time we came. The whole place is three stories! Hopefully you get a station more in the center because shooting into the targets would be much easier.  All of the servers were great from the bar to our table at our station. Fried pickles, fries, and s'mores were perfect to go with our drinks. The only thing I did not like was the jalapeno strawberry margarita - such a weird mix of flavors and had the consistency of syrup (ew..). All the other drinks were delicious though.  WOULD RECOMMEND! I just wish there was a Top Golf in Southern California.",

    "text": "OMG! I wish we had a TopGolf here in San Diego. Please....come to San Diego!  We stopped in here while we were visiting family in Phoenix as a fun little day outing. I'm a big golfer so was a little hesitant on what this \"Top Golf\" was all about but it turned out to be SO MUCH FUN!  If you're not familiar with Top Golf, it's like a driving range on steroids. No, on crack! First off, the facilities were gorgeous and very well organized. You are greeted right when you walk in, there is an area to the right to check in and get your clubs if you don't have any--and then you're escorted to your private section. Each station has a terminal/computer where you enter the player names and the games you wish to play.    What I loved most was how each area was under a large covered patio to protect you from the elements and each had a very comfortable seating area with tables where you can sit, relax, order appetizers, drinks and even have a full blown lunch/dinner if you wanted. While everyone was ordering cocktails, I was so grateful they had an all natural Ginger Ale. I was going to town with those babies.   We had 4 people in our party and we all had different skill levels so the pre programmed games were perfect. I can't recall the names of the games we selected but random targets were given and each of us had a certain amount of balls to hit each one. The closer you got to the target, the more points you got. It was an absolute blast. I also had limitations because I'm preggo but it could not have been a more perfect outing for us. We were having so much fun, we played for hours.   The table service was fantastic and they're on it. As soon as our drinks or appetizers were getting low, they replenished quickly. We thought their prices on the food were pretty reasonable too. We thought we would only be there for an hour to play one game...we ended up spending hours there.   I'm sure we'll be back again during one of our annual trips out to Phoenix.",

It's got the golf aspect, mixed with the team and competition aspects of bowling, with the scoring aspect of darts.  You get a bay with a computer that tracks where you hit your ball. And there are targets on the range worth various points. Hit your targets and score.   Besides the golf, they've got crap loads of bars and have all kinds of booze in bottles and on draught. Plus, their food is great too!  Topgolf is a place to have competitive fun, eat fresh food, get plastered and chase tail. It's super popular, and there's 2-3 hour waits on weekends to get a driving bay. Crazy stuff!  Can't wait til one comes to the Bay Area!  5 stars!!!",

The past three times I have been there I noticed many changes for the worse. First, even though I have been there 50+ times they act like it is my first and make me wait for somebody to show me how the bay works.  Annoying as heck.  Had to wait, even though I paid $50 for a VIP pass, an extra 20 mins for somebody to show me to the bay. Second, the service is horrible. They need to train the staff.  Rude, no empathy, no please and thank you, no nothing.  Third, the bartenders are the worst.  They have no idea how to make a great drink except pouring a beer. Do not have a margarita, they are horrible.  Fourth, the bay we were in you cannot change the channel on TV because it was broken.  They are not keeping up on maintenance.  Fifth, the balls kept getting stuck and not coming out.  Had to have them reset it 5 times in 2 hours.  My opinion is they have leadership and management issues. Focused on profit now and not long term.  They could care less about a long term loyal customer and think they can keep attracting first time visitors. They will not make it 5 years from now if they do not change the service",

Drinks were good, once we got them, food was decent except for the chips, which were disgusting. Like Doritos without flavoring.  Music was awful.

This means I've hit balls at driving ranges varying from the run-down municipal necessities all the way up to fancy, all-grass, manicured country club ranges. But Topgolf? This takes things to the next level. I've never done it like this.   Chipped balls? Computerized leaderboards? Multiple game styles? Up to 5 players per tee? Couches, drink service, and decent food? Yeah. This place is dope.   Topgolf is not the kind of place I'd go just to practice golf. Too impractical and too expensive. Also too crazy packed. But it's definitely a place I'd go with friends for a couple of hours of fun. Or, as on a recent visit, for something like a team-building offsite. It's so much fun that even non-golfers can enjoy it.   There's not a lot more that I can say. Make a reservation and go today. I hear one is coming to Portland, Oregon. I'm stoked about that!",

The member registration is $5 per person on top of what you pay for a spot, which is kind of a funny charge. If you can remember to save your plastic membership card, then you won't have to pay to get a reprint on a return visit. Overall, everyone had fun. The server was very chill and I appreciate that she wasn't pushy about trying to sell food and drinks. The food reminds me of Chili's or Applebee's type fare and I like that they sell local, Arizona beer.  The staff did such a great job with our large group.

Byron took excellent care of us at the membership counter and he's a fellow Iowan and Hawkeye fan so he's got my vote for Employee of the Month.    Then we walked around and checked out everything.  We really liked how roomy each section is with plenty of seating and a couple of TVs.  The range looks like a lot of fun with a variety of targets, and I also noticed how clean everything was.    We cruised through the bar and noticed there are some large booths with their own TV so you can sit with your group and watch your game of choice.  They also have a gaming area for those not swinging a club.  There were a lot of staff around and they were smiling and making sure people had what they needed, or answering any questions.    While on the way to the restrooms I noticed they have some meeting rooms and one group had booked one for their fantasy league draft.  We got a look at their catered food of wings and some other munchies and it all looked and smelled delicious.  I didn't snag any as I walked by, I swear!    Even though my golf clubs are only in the house as potential weapons now and I call myself a reformed golfer, I would definitely look forward to a corporate event or night out with out-of-town guests at Topgolf.  GREAT place!",

I had mentioned it to her that we have religious restrictions as far as food is concerned. Since our outing was booked as an event, we had our own ambassador and food buffet. The food was not prepared according to our restrictions and even though they fixed it, no one really touched the brisket and I paid a lot of money so that wasn't okay. They also need to provide booked events with more than one ambassador, since one person really can't handle a large group.  Overall wasn't bad but could have been better.",

We gave our friend a golf putter as a gift that he had set by the table.  This was a limited edition piece that definitely stood out from what Topgolf has.  It suddenly went missing, after looking everywhere we asked to see a manager.  When he came over we told him since we were in a corner it wasn't as if someone had walked by and taken it; there had only been staff where it had been placed.  The manager became very defensive saying we shouldn't be blaming his staff and he would look at the security camera.  A few minutes later a staff member came over with the putter saying it was in Lost and Found.  Really? So they took it from us and put it in Lost and Found and didn't make sure it wasn't someone's? Very unlikely story.  Also the manager never came back to apologize or anything.  On top of it while we were looking for the putter the wait staff cleared our drinks that we weren't finished with so we had to purchase more.",

When ever someone from out of town visits, I always make it a point to take them here to play some games, and have a brew or 2.  I'm also a fan of the food.  While it's not fine dining, it's actually really good for drinking beer, and their presentations are pretty on point.  The Mushi is a good one to try, and their flatbreads are pretty tasty as well.  They also make a great bloody mary.  For the True golfers out there, feel free to bring your clubs, but if your driving by and are thinking about needing to go home to grab them, forget it.  The clubs they have there are decent enough.  Besides, you're not really at Top Golf to golf, its really more of an experience where golf is just part of the equation.",

For the entire weekend, Top Golf added a $50 charge to every two hour reservation, which is a bit sheisty. The first floor is clearly not as fun as the third floor, so avoid the basement, but nothing else was available. Will return on a weekday, non-holiday when prices are normal, non ripoff.      Ok, so I really enjoyed the Brisket Grilled Cheese which was a hearty sandwich with some quality brisket inside the bread and two kinds of cheeses. Skip the flatbread and pass on the nachos because they are just eight chips total. The $8 Bloody Mary was pretty good and the chicken sandwich was just your basic bird, but the queso dip was above average. Nothing special about the burger either. I thought Top Golf had a gourmet menu (article I read), but not quite.",

Food, drinks, games to play. The food was amazing. The mai tai was refreshing. The staff signed a birthday card for me and stopped by to say hello. This is how you run an operation. I had been once before but was with too large of a group to truly enjoy it. My wife enjoyed the \"first\" time hitting golf balls. We will be back soon.",

Had a lot of fun with friends and music is just loud enough to have a good time but not too high where you can't hear the person next to you. My friends even took their 3 month old baby and he slept through the entire night. Drinks are ok but food is great! I had the chopped salad and good quality ingredients, also the flatbread is made fresh and very tasty. Excellent service, she was checking on us regularly and even brought the new server to introduce her before she ended her shift. We will definitely come back.",

If you look at their menu there clearly pushing the alcohol agenda since there's about 25 pages of alcohol drinks and three things to order to eat.   Not so much a place to take kids more of a place to get drunk with your friends and eat really crappy food that's expensive.  Oh yeah I might add that the food is really really awful it is like What one might expect to get at a movie theater, Quality and price.  I'm actually very disappointed.  One might expect a higher quality of food coming from a casino but I guess this is not the dot type of casino. I would not consider to try any other food until the menu is changed",

    "text": "The only positive part of our experience was our server- she was very friendly and attentive. However, the operations at Topgolf were a huge miss.   My brother booked a 3 hour bay for his birthday online and they seated us in a bay per usual. After about 10 minutes they notified us that after an hour of use they would need to move us to accommodate another party. We asked if we could just be moved right then, they agreed and had us stop play. Sitting there waiting for direction for another 15 minutes or so, we were encouraged to grab our drinks ourselves and headed to the booth we were told. Upon arrival they wouldn't start us and asked us not to set our drinks down as it wasn't our bay (but it actually was). Finally, after another 10 minutes, they sat us down and we were able to begin.   All was well until we were leaving, then another \"hearing of the cattle\" scenario began. We first noticed we were charged time from the original bay (4 balls were hit due to operational disorganization) and no less than 5 minutes after our hour ended we were told by 3 different people within that 5 minute period that we had to leave. We were well on our way out, when another assistant told my sister-in-law she needed to leave the bay as she was buckling her 6 month old into the stroller.   Needless to say, the overall attitude presented to us by the team was enough that we won't be returning.",

    "text": "I've been to the location Vegas, and this one was not a great deal different. It's a pretty fun experience and a good way to spend a few hours with a group of friends - as long as you don't mind spending osme coin.  We checked in and were told there'd be a 40 minute wait, so grabbed a drink in the meantime. The bar staff were efficient, though some beers were under-poured. There's a nice seating area upstairs by the bar and they had heaters running. We were called up really quickly then had to wait 10 minutes for a bay, which was odd, but fine. Then we were assigned one that was already in use, so quite a bit of carry-on and confusion before we got to our bay and were settled.  Since we'd been before we were able to remember and re-use the memberships we'd set up last time. There's a charge of $5 to sign up and an expectation for every member of the party to have their own membership - which I have to say cheapens the experience for me. I resent knowing I'll have to unsubscribe from their marketing every time I go here. It's also a pain to have to try to remember some username and password you set up months before (and likely while tipsy) - so that's pretty irritating.  Once in the booth, the servers were adept at handling large drunk groups, which I applaud. The game itself is fun enough, though we couldn't figure out an easy way to make it accessible to our various skill levels.",

Went with a group of friends on a Monday morning, enjoying some drinks and golf when our range time eventually expired. As we were finishing our drinks, a customer service representative came up with other people to inform us that the bay we were in was now booked for someone else. Surprising was the fact that there were at least 50 other bays available on our level alone. Lack of tact and hospitality sent a clear message that if you aren't spending money, they want you out. Understandable to a degree if there were no open bays and it was a busy night, but to boot us immediately after our time expired and we were finishing drinks left a sour taste in my mouth.",

We have went two other times and it has been amazing, but the FOOD AND ENTERTAINMENT (fireworks didn't go off) were just plain disappointing! We were greeted warmly and seated quickly. THE staff is WONDERFUL so that was the best part.  Who serves fancy food at a golf course? Overrated and cold just was a poor choice. The pork was dry the other mystery meat inedible and Kale salad? The potatoes bland and cold as were the brussel sprouts. (We were the first in line so we were surprised everything was cold). Then to end it with cold donut holes! We ended up having to order off the menu and of course pay extra. I think this will be our last NYE party at Topgolf. It's too bad it could be such a fabulous event. Way overpriced for what we received!",

If you are thinking eeewww golf, you shouldn't, really, Topgolf is fun! It's like a hybrid of mini golf & skeet ball    One think I like about this place, there is no hidden cost, a bay is a flat rate, from open to 12 pm its $25 per hour, from 12pm to 5pm $35 per hour and 5pm to close $45 an hour, and for a bay of 6 you can easily get through a game within that hour.  Topgolf also serves food and drinks, has some gaming systems and pool tables if not ready to leave yet.  Seriously, this is some fun times, take your family, go with friends, make it a date night, but go and have fun!",

We showed up in the early evening on a Friday night and were told it would be a two hour wait. We were cool with that and had dinner at the sports bar inside. It ended up that the two hour way was totally off. We waiting another hour and were told it'd be at least another 30 minutes. By this time, we were ready to leave... and we did. However, Andrew saw us on the way out and asked if we enjoyed our experience. We told how how disappointed we were with our first ever Top Golf visit.  He apologized and invited us back the next night. We arrived and they were READY FOR US. A host took us to our spot, introduced us to our waitress, set up our game, and we were loving it all in no time. It was a fantastic experience. Any level of golfer (even someone who's never touched a club before) will love Top Golf. It's a genius concept and, with customer service like Andrew's, we can't wait to go back.  If only Los Angeles had a Top Golf!",

    "text": "So I specifically made a yelp account to leave this review, because I saw it when I was exiting your building and I wanted to share my experience!  But anyway, I've been to Topgolf Scottsdale roughly a handful of times. Always a great experience, everyone is typically very friendly and polite, food is good, golf is fun. However, I wanted to write about my specific experience the last time I was here. I came in a couple Fridays ago and I brought my family. I had a very large family, with several little kids under the age of 12. Everyone was very well accommodating and they helped us with everything, even so much as helping to carry our clubs.   We got sent down to the first floor, which was totally ok, with younger kids it helped put my mind at ease slightly, knowing I wouldn't have to stress about them getting close to the yellow line.   We were sent all the way down, I believe bay 101 or 102, so a little ways down there, but we remained in good spirits!  My husband arrived first and had already had the bay reserved for us, he goes to Topgolf quite frequently.   Almost immediately we were greeted by our server, which is why I am writing this review. She was spectacular, funny, friendly and went above and beyond anything we could have ever hoped. We all felt the need to give her a hug when we left because she treated us as if we were her own family.   Her name was Torie and we loved her, she was from somewhere around Pittsburgh, in case you have more than one Torie working there! She taught us so much about Topgolf and where the company was going, which was so cool to learn about! She delivered excellent service, giving us recommendations and tips on fun games to play, but she didn't just stop there! She completely surpassed any service we had received before.  Like I mentioned before we had several kids, very young, with us. She was wonderful with them! She made them chocolate milks, brought them cups with lids, and cleaned up every spill we made, and there were plenty of them! All through this, she remained with a smile on her face. She even went so far as giving my youngest golf lessons and tips because he was getting frustrated every time he got up to golf. She worked with him until he was hitting golf balls better than me! Where most people would get frustrated with a group like ours, she didn't show it at all.   She made our experience unforgettable. We kept her running back and forth because we were eating, drinking and hanging out with friends from out of town. It wasn't until we got up to leave, before we noticed how much walking back and forth she must have done for us, and she never let it show. Once we got up and realized she must have walked so much taking care of us, my husband tried to hand her additional cash for our gratitude, which she refused, insisting we had already left plenty. We hid it under the ketchup bottle anyway! She was amazing and cared so much about our experience, which warmed my heart. The bay next to us also couldn't stop raving about how great she was!  It is clear she loves the company, and what she does. You have a real gem there, Topgolf. Hold onto her as long as you can because she made our experience unforgettable.   Please pass this along to her!   Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to share and let everyone know that Topgolf is a wonderful place! It is so much fun no matter your age, please give it a visit!",

After a minor issue with payment, our attendant was very understanding, helped us and was courteous with timing. We had 2 bays, due to card issue 1 was taking longer to reserve, so it was almost taken. When we informed the attendant who was trying to give it away, she was rude to the our attendant and was being condescending which none of us thought was ok to do in front of customers. There were 18 of us who witnessed this. Which is why I am giving a good rating, we had great/excellent at service until we witnessed this. Food was GREAT, we had queso, chips were a little stale tasting, but not bad. I heard from friend the quesadillas were amazing, pretzels were good minus the cheese. I also heard the burger was amazing too.  Music could have been better, at random moments it would come blaring through, so more consistent or variety of music would be great!",

We made a reservation several hours in advance for a golf bay with a couch and when we got there they had set us up in the only bay completely cast in the sun. We kindly asked to be moved to one of the many adjacent open bays with couches only to be talked back to and given terrible attitude by our waitress Elizabeth. Eventually we were moved to a bay with a high top table in the shade but were continually given sass and attitude by Elizabeth. I recommend Topgolf hire people who are kind and nice.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Topgolf, for a friend's 21st birthday. We didn't make a reservation, but as it was a Tuesday night they weren't very busy and got us a spot right away. There were eight of us and we all went in one space. Only six can golf at once but there was plenty of room for all of us and we all took turns golfing anyway.   I'm not a good golfer but I had an awesome time anyway! The automatic ball dispenser is just so easy, and there are so many holes to hit that even I, with my lack of hand-eye coordination, was able to score enough points to feel accomplished.   The staff was wonderful and helpful. They really made my friend feel special for her birthday and were incredibly accommodating and friendly.   We also got a lot of food and drinks. I was less impressed with the food than I thought I'd be. The prosciutto-artichoke flatbread was amazing though! The nachos were alright, and pretty small for sharing. The drinks were a little inconsistent but still good.   Overall, I had an awesome first time here. The staff really elevated the experience and the view is incredible! When it gets dark the holes light up and the Talking Stick Resort glows in the background. I would absolutely come back, great for any occasion!",

Prepare yourselves with a golf glove instead of coming here on a whim (aka me) to avoid the possible blister on your thumb from gripping the golf club too tight. Came here before the 5pm rush for $35/hour. This place is great for groups. With your lifetime membership for $5 plus tax you can save every score that you ever made and check up on your scores. Waitresses/waiters will be at your bay to take your food/beverage orders. There are tv monitors if you really don't want to play golf too. Plushy couches to sit comfortably on for a party of 6. And there are misters to somewhat cool you off in the summer heat.   Immediately got a bay in less than 5 minutes. Took the top view and awfully attempted to score points based on accuracy but failed miserably. Let's just say I would not want to share my score. I just have to come back and practice more. Also played pool downstairs and virtual darts. This entire place is busy on the weekends. You don't have to be in golf attire. Comfy clothes like flip flops, tank and shorts are good enough.    Can't wait for the San Tan location to open up!!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?  There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.    The second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.    Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.    After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.    Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.    We head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.    We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a \"slider\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.  When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.  So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.  The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.    OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.     Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",

What better way than to hit up a driving range?  And if that driving range had fans/misters blowing on you (heaters in the winter), music playing and has servers bringing you good food and drinks at fair prices, how could you pass that up?!  You can put up to 6 players on one lane and split the hourly rate amongst you to make it really affordable, even at peak prices.  Be warned they get very busy on weekend evenings and its not uncommon to wait 2-3 hours for a lane.  So be prepared to spend time at one of their bars or have some food while you wait. You can also play pool, shuffleboard or Nintendo Wii games on the second floor while you wait for your lane to open.  They weren't letting people bring their own clubs for a while, but that may have changed.  Call to be sure.",

    "text": "ONLY WORTH GOING ONCE! Management take note!    I went to school for Hotel and Restaurant Management. There is a ton of things that need to be fixed. I was very disappointed.   I would rate this two different categories.  First, the service was awful! This company needs to have more employees in the restaurant area. We waited 30 to find an area \"tables\" where they serve you. If you are not in this area forget about getting a drink or food. Then we waited about 20 more minutes to place our orders. OUR FOOD CAME BEFORE OUR DRIKS, huge fail! We sent my friends order back two times. They need to have more than two computers to place orders. Have you though about servers having iPads to place the orders from? All employees who serve and or run food orders need to know the menu. Our food runner did not know what ingredients were in what my friend ordered.  They need to have cocktail takers who walk the whole area of the restaurant. We had several food runners ask us, Did you order...?  How are your orders printed out? No table numbers to what is ordered? They need to go back to training their service staff stat!   Second category, food/atmosphere.   The food and atmosphere is great. The tacos were to die for!! Way to go to the chef! Once you get to your bay the service is good.   I would go once to experience this. Not eager to go again. You would think they have various locations that they would have things down by now!",

Here's our breakdown: We had a group of 6 that went today for the first time, (2 people are avid golfers, the other 4 have never touched clubs). We arrived on a Saturday around 3:00PM...We had created accounts ahead of time, which sped up the \"check-in\" process...We requested a third tier bay (we had read those have the best views) and were escorted to our area within 5 minutes. It was $52 for an hour and a half of play time (so worth it!). Then we all had a round of drinks and split 3 flatbreads, which cost about $65 + tip. Our server was great (thanks Haley!) and the food was delicious. We got through an entire game of 20 balls per person (I recommend each person hitting at least 4 balls/turn, it flows a little better). We will definitely be going again! (Also, apparently after 6:00PM is when the hour wait starts, so that's when they recommend using the $50 priority pass thingy.)",

We promptly placed our order at that's where everything went downhill....  -after 30 min I had to flag someone down to bring us our waters and drinks -after 60 min our food showed up w no silverware or napkins.  We asked for some, and received 1 set....yes, we had to then ask for two more sets. -we then asked to speak w a manager, who asked what we wanted, let us explain what happened, asked ZERO follow-up questions, said \"thank you for the feedback\", and walked away.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!  Nothing, no empathy, no apology, no interest in digging in to what happened.  \"Thank you for the feedback\".    Like I said, I enjoyed the golf experience, but would never step in that bar again.. Great Customer service is a culture you foster,  and if the mgrs. don't understand it,  why would the servers?",

I look at the golf bag I'm carrying - which belongs to my 8 year old son who, can hit it about 75 yards if he catches it all... but say, \"OK, cool we won't use it.

That's the restaurant with golf right?\" To which they laughed and said \"Um more like golf with a restaurant.\"   Anyway- this place is pretty cool. I don't think there's really anything else like it in AZ but I feel like this place is so ridiculously popular now (any place that can convince my brother to leave the couch says it all) that a second location has got to be in the works, right?   Also, the food is pretty damn good! I was expecting it to be subpar just because you know how cool places like this don't really need good food. Just like a super model doesn't need to be smart, it doesn't matter. They've already got things going for them. But their food was super good! I had the nachos and they were tasty! Good for you, Topgolf, you're a smart super model or...eh whatever, you get what I mean.   My only complaint is that the service in the restaurant/bar isn't that great. It's a lot of young servers, which I don't mind, but they need some more training. For example, when I inquired about my drink after everyone had already been served there's don't say \"Oh yeah, I forgot. It's been sitting on the bar this whole time, let me get it.\" Um...cool thanks, I'm sure it's nice and watered down, just how I like it. Haha. Or when we said we wanted to order some starters don't say \"Did you want to order them now?\" when we're staring at you. No, actually next week please. Thanks for clarifying. Come on! Ha but that's me being nit-picky and I'm coming from a place of love in that this place is too cool to be dragged down but silly servers. Then again, I am the dipshit that remarked \"Topgolf! I love that restaurant!\" lol so I guess the silly servers are in good company with a silly customer! Haha",

    "text": "Incredibly Disappointing On All Levels: We went to Top Golf for a celebration and were accompanied by my mother-in-law who uses a walker. After waiting over 30 minutes to get a bay, we were finally given a bay on the first level. We had to walk all the way to the end of the first floor corridor to get a table that allows disability access and seating. Once we got to the bay, we were asked to swipe our credit card immediately and told our time was running immediately. I asked if we could have five minutes to look over the menu before the time started tolling, the answer was no. Best of all, when we tried to begin golfing our bay was broken and would not dispense any balls. A technician was called and arrived after 15 minutes, we were told any time lost would be credited. After working for 20 minutes,the technician told us he could not fix it and would try to find us a replacement bay. Of course, none were available and we were told to wait to see if he could fix the bay. At this point, we had been there for an hour and half and not even hit a ball. Ultimately, we were told we could get another bay, but there would be no seating for the disabled and that we would have to walk to the opposite end of the corridor again. After waiting and walking back and forth through the complex we gave up and asked for a refund. We were told they had to get the manager, which took another 20 minutes. The manager eventually came, but was annoyed we wanted a refund and tried to get us to stay in the bay, which the technician said might not work since he did not know what was wrong with it. After an hour and half, walking my mother in law all over the place and no golf we left incredible disappointed and frustrated. Frankly, I could not believe that in this day and age top golf would be so unfriendly and lack compassion for parties who have people with disabilities. Even when attempting to use the elevator, the host had my mother-in-law squeeze herself with her walker next to a large rolling dumpster, forcing the rest of our party to use the stairs and meet her at the bottom. I'm also amazed that my recommendation that top golf put bays with lower seating that is accessible for those with disabilities closer to the entry and not at the end of the corridor seemed to be a profound revelation to the manager. Again, an incredibly disappointing experience that should give people with a conscience great pause before spending money at this place! This epitomizes what happens when corporate greed and thinking like an automaton replaces customer service, thoughtfulness and compassion.",

    "text": "As an avid golfer, I SO looked forward to the grand opening of the Scottsdale location. However, after two visits with the same issues, I felt I needed to leave a review to hopefully save others some trouble. (Always plan on at least a 1-hour wait.)  First problem: They seems to be grossly understaffed with their phone lines. I was trying to get a rough estimate on wait times the day-of, but could not get through to anyone on the phone. No sure how I'm supposed to plan my outing with friends if no one is available to answer the phones?  I then got fed up with waiting on the phones for more than 15-minutes, so decided to stop in because I was passing them anyways. They told me about an hour-long wait for a bay. I then put my name down, and texted my friends to come on over. An hour goes by, and my bay still hasn't opened. We ended up waiting another HOUR for our bay...absolutely ridiculous.   The staff at the concierge service seemed to be high schoolers without ANY training in basic customer service. Even went as far to say \"yeah, you're not the only one to complain.\" I asked for a manager, and no one could be found. The food, drinks and games were great, as usual. However, the obvious lack of customer services training, under staffing of phone lines, and grossly inaccurate wait times left me with a bad taste in my mouth.   To the managers at Top Golf, PLEASE train your staff on customer service etiquette, and figure out a way to accurately give out wait times. Answering your phones wouldn't hurt, either.",

    "text": "Overall, I agree with my fellow Yelpers. I am a fan of TopGolf because who refuses entertainment and fun at the brainchild of a sports bar and 3-story driving range with a lounge?   It can be a bit confusing when you first arrive. The parking has never been an issue for me though I've noticed some complaints. You do have to get a card for $5 but once you have that, you are golden, like lifetime membership status. You can upgrade for VIP service if you need that distinction. There is a second line to get your bay but it goes pretty fast. I will say my last experience there, the POS was down and we got overcharged for our bay and wasn't too happy with that oversight. The terminals are pretty easy to set up your games but if you need instruction, there's always a friendly group next to you such as mine or the staff.  Now, if you are a True golfer, yes your snobbery is duly noted that it is nothing like the real driving range. But come on? Not too many of those are open late night with a fantastic light show to feed your Masters' dream. If you get bored with the games, you can always strut down to the bar and check out the multiple TV screens and colorful patrons. Where else other than the WM Phoenix Open are you going to find women scantily clad when golf is involved?  Staff is spotty when it comes to bay service but overall attentive to your needs. Food is pretty good and the drinks are extensive enough for your various taste buds. Overall, it's fun for big group outings and company events. I prefer night time because you can catch the sunset and the balmy breeze almost makes you feel like you got transported outside the desert.",

It's set up like a bowling alley and everyone has their own little area. While playing, you can order drinks and food from your area. It's outside but covered and in shade so not too hot. I may like it a little more because I beat all of the golfers but it's still perfect for all skill levels",

I had never been to a place like this, it seemed like bowling to me but golf style - very creative!   Staff was awesome and so friendly. You are greeted as soon as you finish walking up the steps to the entrance. Our waitress was great, she was serving us as well as a huge party and did an excellent job attending to us both.   The food was just okay... We got chips and guac, which the guac was just average to me and the salsa didn't really have much of a flavor. I did get the veggie burger and that was awesome! I ordered a side salad and was super sad to find that it came with cheese, eggs, and bacon. Most side salads don't come with those add-ins so I didn't think to ask! I just picked around them and it was no problem.   Overall, I had a blast. It was so worth the wait and I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Golf, Darts and Bowling all in one!  We went to Top Golf with some friends while we were attending Spring Training. We had a free day and decided to make a reservation and try it since last year, with no reservation, we could not get in because it was such a busy popular place. Our wives have never touched a golf club in their lives and were content to just have some Bloody Mary's and watch us play but we convinced them, with the assistance of our waitress, to just have fun and enjoy the day. They were both beaming with smiles and laughs a plenty with in the first ten minutes of playing. It's like golf for obvious reasons, it's like darts because the targets have bulls eyes with an inner ring and outer rings and it's like bowling because you all take turns and compete individually or as teams. Our waitress was amazing, after checking in, they text you which bay to report to and your waitress meets you there to get you checked in and give you a tutorial. She then takes your drink and food orders and then it becomes really fun. You rent the bay by the hour and you are prompted when your time is running out and you then have the option to play out your time or add more time. The girls who did not want to play at all then wanted to extend our time and before we knew it, we were there three hours. For the three hours, adult beverages and food for four, we were into it for about $200 for the entire group. There were people all around us of varying ages and abilities and they were all having a really good time. My wife was talking about how much fun she had all day and said she could not wait until Spring Training next year to do it again. They are building another facility over in Glendale, right on the other side of the freeway from the football stadium. We saw it under construction while driving back and forth to Spring Training games. So, I hope that relieves some of the popularity and will make it more receptive to walking in. This is a great activity to do with your entire family!",

We enjoyed the pretzel bites as an appetizer, pepperoni pizza and chicken sandwich for dinner, and a Moscow Mule and Orange Dream for our drinks. Our server, Alex, was on top of it and made sure everything worked out. This is a great place to hang out with friends, take the family, or host a birthday party.

We paid $35 for one hour of \"golf\" and ordered additional food and drinks with our server. We played a simple game where we could earn points by hitting any of the targets. I like the automated ball dispenser. Wave a club and like magic, a ball comes out!  Since we had a tight timeline, we had to leave after just one hour.

Okay onto TopGolf... the membership card is $5 and good for a lifetime. The game is a driving range and the point is to hit the ball into colored areas on the field. The balls are microchipped so the computer tracks where the balls land and tallies the score appropriately. Like I said, super cool! Also, you don't even have to fetch balls in a basket; just wave the stick over the sensor and the device automatically dispenses a ball. Happy golfing!",

Went here for my dad's birthday, went with mom dad husband and myself. We arrived on a non holiday weekend, noon Saturday, and it was kinda busy, our wait was about half an hour, so we decided to eat first. After we ordered, don't remember how long that was, we got our text saying that our bay was ready and that we could also eat at the bay. Yay!  Went to the bay, our appetizers were there: macaroni egg rolls and wings. Eggrolls of Mac n cheese was such a neat idea and the green chili in it made it really good and not too heavy as you'd think fried mac n cheese would be! Wings were fine, nothing stellar. We also got burgers. Those were fine, got Mac daddy and sunrise. Mac daddy seemed a bit much as far as being heavy, or maybe I had had my fill of Mac n cheese..anyway, we concluded that when we come back we'd just order snacks / appetizers and not burgers. Might try other stuff? Tots were good!  Golfing! So fun. It's kinda like bowling where you take your turn and watch others take theirs, but unless one of your is a real golf guru, it's pretty funny to watch your group. Not as easy as it looks and I definitely have more respect for golfers now =p Anyway, 4 people, 2 hours, 60$, not bad! Plus there's a lounge (I didn't go to) and food if you wanted to kill more time there.   At least try it once! It's fun!",

    "text": "I came here to celebrate a friends birthday. I have never been, but I hear a lot of people talk about this place so I was pretty excited to finally experience it!   We came on a Saturday and it was extremely busy, which is I guess the norm for this place. Top golf is basically a bowling alley for the golfer in you. They have what they call \"bays\" or \"lanes\" compared to bowling lingo. It's 3 stories and each story has a bar and a row of bays along the edge. Each golf ball has a little chip in it, which is how they can keep score within your group. They serve all kinds of bar food and drinks and yes kids are allowed to come here, I was under the impression that it was adults only but no I noticed a lot of children and babies, I wouldn't bring my children here on a weekend night why?  so many drunks!  We had a 3 hour wait for a bay, so we decided to chill at the bar/lounge on the 3rd floor. We ordered cheese fries, bacon cheeseburger, calamari, and guacamole and chips. I wasn't very impressed with the food at all! The guacamole was definitely the instant packet guacamole either that or they over did a certain spice on our order. Cheese fries lacked a lot of flavor, and don't even get me started on the bacon cheeseburger that came with no cheese. The food takes FOREVER to arrive that honestly you're so hungry you can't complain on how much flavor it lacks. I ordered a Moscow mule and it was quite delicious so thumbs up for that!   By the time we got into our bay I was exhausted! I was ready to go home! Our server for our bay was pretty nice, but extremely slow. It took 20min for an order of water to arrive.   All in all its a pretty cool concept, but in my opinion it is little too over hyped. I would definitely only visit during weekdays not a weekend NEVER AGAIN.  Unless I make reservations ahead of time. Service was ok, extremely slow. I mean if you know your business is extremely busy on certain nights I would think they would at least be fully staffed and prepared to accommodate all of their guests. The food  was not good at all for the price I was expecting something better.",

    "text": "I've been to Topgolf once before at the Gilbert location. This was my first time here at the Scottsdale one. I came here on a Saturday night. It was expected to be busy and they told us it would be a 30-35 minute wait. We were a group of 5 and we sat at the bar to wait. Surprisingly we didn't wait long. They took us to our bay 10 minutes after we waited. We ordered some drinks and food. The golfing experience was fun but the services was not good. I ordered French fries from the bar area and they said they would deliver it to the golf area because it was our time to go and then my friends ordered a chicken grilled sandwich and buffalo wings but they took over an hour to our food come to the table. The lady who served us was very rude too. My friend wanted to order the top golf drink bag and the waitress looked over at his girlfriend and gave a rude remark how she already has a drink in front of her so she can't order another one. But really my friend was ordering the drink to share with another guy in our group. She also was rarely present at out table. She only checked on us probably twice the entire 2-3 hours we were there. Maybe she was having a bad night or she was busy with the other tables which I understand but she could have been nicer and more attentive. My friend pointed out that she didn't even look at us in the eyes either. But I'm an understanding person so I would come back again and give it a second chance. But for now I will give this place 3 stars.",

I get my clubs cleaned up (I had been before and used their clubs that sound like dead softball bats) so I could use them.   Check in, clubs in hand, ready to get a nice bloody mary, even got on Tier 3...cool!     \"Sir,\" the pro or head staff member or whatever his title is \"Sir, you can't use your driver and woods on tier 3.\"      \"Excuse me?\"  I reply, the words hitting me in the face with their condescension and the reality that this dude has no customer service skills.  \"We would be glad to check them or you can move to tier 1...the reservation doesn't allow outside drivers or woods on tier 2 or tier 3\"  \"Did someone mention this to my wife when she booked the reservation?\"  Blank faces.   Dull stares.  \"I will just put my clubs in my car.\"  I turn to leave  \"But sir, we can che....\"   \"I said I will put them in my car.\"  That was my first experience, on father's day, at TopGolf Scottsdale.   Our service was poor at best.  It wasn't full in the slightest and the dude had a hard time keeping water (the sun beats right in your face in the morning in this location probably another \"THE RESERVATION MADE US!! WAAAH!!\" excuse) and ice in our drinks.   We got food, we got a few drinks (stick to beer these guys couldn't make a decent bloody mary if their life depended on it) did out time and got out of there.  I say go to Gilbert, go to Avondale, go to Tucson.   I am not sure if they have the same driver and woods rule at those locations and I wish Scottsdale had that somewhere on their landing page.   Fake customer service from the second walking in.   If I had it to do over again I would have probably got the money back and done something else.    Way to ruin father's day TopGolf Scottsdale!",

That gets you nothing other than \"skipping\" the line whether or not a line exists. It does not count towards game play, it does not count towards food. Nothing. So, on say a Saturday to play for an hour with a reservation you would pay $54 for the reservation, another $54 for an hour of play, and whatever food and drink you order. Enjoy!",

I love going with small and big groups of friends. I recommend to show up early on weekends because they don't take reservations and the bays are a 1-3 hr wait on Fridays Saturdays and Sundays. Plan accordingly because it's certainly worth it. The staff is always friendly too. My friends who have worked there always have nothing but positive things to say. That's already impressive in my book! :)",

    "text": "This place is a good time.  My favorite things about this place are... *you don't have to be a golfer--there are a variety of people there, from the hot shot show-off guys/girls with perfect form to the people who have the baseball swing and connect the club to the ball only some of the time. *you don't need to own clubs or bring yours because they have every kind, for both women and men. *you have your own little area so not to feel violated by others invading your space.  It's fun even with two people (a PERFECT first date spot) and especially rad with a group.  Plenty of sitting and standing space, with tables and cushioned chairs and servers who frequently check on you and bring you drinks/food. *menu is basic bar food but it's fantastic FOR being bar food.  My favorite thing are the fillable donut holes.  Jesus Christ and Satan himself, these are off the charts, kick you in the face type of wonderful.  A bunch of warm, sugary donut holes with huge syringes full of either Bavarian (the BEST) creme, chocolate (way too thin and runny) or raspberry that you fill the donut holes with yourself.  I love that you can put whatever amount you personally like into each instead of it just being what it is and how they decide to make it.  Usually it's never enough.  My mouth just filled up with spit.   *best Moscow Mules...I tried it for the first time here, and now order that every time I visit *your score is emailed to you if you choose, so you always have a memento or record of the games you come to play with friends.   *the variety of games you can choose, from super easy to the more challenging/semi-pro-ish.  All are so much fun; if you're the competitive type, this is the place for you.   On the flip side, some things I personally dislike are: *time flies when you're having fun, but so does the money out of your account if you want to play for multiple hours.  Pretty pricey.  My cousin and I went once and our bill with food and drinks came to about $200.  If you check, your screen will tell you how long you have left, but always be aware of the time and play accordingly.  Unless you can accurately flex, in which case go nuts.   *if they are too full and you're on the list, there's only one pool table to play on while you're waiting.  Seriously guys it's better to have zero.  That place gets packed, so if you're going to have pool tables, have pool tableS. I know it's not called \"TopBilliards\" but still....Anyway, to avoid any super sucky wait time, always get a reservation.    The pros outweigh the cons, by a lot...and I know I'm forgetting some other good stuff.  TLDR: you don't need to be a pro or even have a set of clubs--there's a grip of people who don't know squat about golf but everyone can play and have a great time.  You'll love it!",

One little thing though that's offputting is how they include the price of the game with any items your server brings out such as food and drinks as one bill, that percentage-wise, makes it seem that you need to tip more at the end. I mean, if it costs $35 to hit balls for an hour, and you order one $5 beer, you now owe more for the tip on that beer than the beer itself.  It seems like trickery to get the servers bigger tips. Not a fan of that method. Is that a little thing? I don't know, but I think I'll continue tipping on the service instead of the price to play regardless of how the bill is compiled.",

We originally had our bay on regular high table since we brought my 91 years young mother in law, we requested to move to the sofa instead and our bay attendant helped us with no problems at all, that was great.  We ordered couple light food here since it was a bit early for lunch and we loved it. Nacho was delicious and my son had chicken tender with fruit was yummy.  The service is great as always here, thank you again Topgolf!",

They would not let my 5 yr old bring hers- if she can hit it that hard I should check her on the pro tour. Then they have this crazy checkin system with 2 lines and you have to remember to bring your card from last time. Very antiquated. Second line for a bay. Strange But once you are playing it is really cool - bar and wait service, decent prices and good food. Just not the place to actually practice your game. Only for social hour. The price is the same regardless how many players so good for a group. Expensive solo. Very loud",

Great facility, everything is state of the art. Staff was friendly and fun.   Some tips: If you are gonna play I recommend to eat before you play, the bay cost is $45/hour prices differ depending when you go, with food it will slow you down and you will have a lot of waisted time. Appetizers and drinks while playing are a go however!  Cons: Registering as a member took a long time, but you only have to register once. Parking. Service can be slow, but it is a huge establishment, a lot of ground to cover and extremely busy, was to be expected.   Lastly, no Woods. Not a big deal, Top Golf really is not a driving range in the traditional sense. It's a target game, trying to earn points by hitting targets. It is a lot of fun and really great practice for the people who are going there just for that.",

You have to stand in a line to purchase the $5 lifetime membership which requires getting a players card set up. After that, you have to go to another line to reserve the bay. The signage isn't helpful at all in explaining what you need to do. If your lucky, someone walking around with an iPad will approach you and you can get signed up for the players card that way. If going with a group, I would suggest that everyone is already signed up for the membership card prior to going. Also I wouldn't recommend going on a Friday or Saturday night unless you want to spend 2-3hrs waiting for a bay to open up.   It's easy to see why this place is happening on the weekends because it is addicting and fun. You could easily spend 4-5hrs here. Bay rentals are $45/hr but if you split it between everyone playing it really isn't that bad. They don't take reservations, but once you arrive you can check in and get your name on the list.",

As a supposedly 5-Star establishment, the poor reservation planning and staff treatment fully earns a 1-Star.  Our reservation was kicked back 2.5 hours...the reason for it appeared shady, but it looked like someone else had more money than I, because everything changed when he came in the door.  To make up for the wait, they offered to let us play in the basement level....No, No, and No.  From other unhappy reviews of Top Golf Scottsdale, this appears to be common practice with buying your way to play.   What is $50 to make a reservation?  Does anyone else do this? And it doesn't count for a damn thing.  Especially if they can't keep a reservation.  Then to \"top golf\" the night, they have young kids running the operation.  When you screw up someone's night, I don't need a high school kid telling me he can't fix it.

They had 2 pool tables and video games along with a lounge. The bar itself was big with lots of tv's. The place was busy but not crowded which was cool. The bartenders were friendly and were on top of making sure you had a drink. You can play different types of golf games and the rate depends on when you go (FYI - the rate almost doubles the later you go so try and get there in the morning)",

    "text": "This place is awesome. It takes your traditional driving range to the next level by making a game out of it, using computer-chipped balls to keep score. It's really not unfairly-priced, either, when you factor in the fun! The easiest thing to equate the experience to is going bowling, except the facilities are way better than about 99% of the bowling alleys I've been to (and I've been to a lot of bowling alleys. Ha!).  We stopped in just to see what it was about, and figured we'd play for an hour. Instead, we stayed for THREE hours. The fact that it's also a full service sports bar/restaurant with decent food and TV's at every bay where you can control the games you want to watch, makes it an incredibly easy way to spend a few hours. Especially during the NFL season when NFL Sunday Ticket is nice to have at your disposal.  The golfing aspect is cool. I didn't bring my clubs on our trip, so it's nice that TopGolf offers their own assortment of clubs. They're color-coded for men's and women's and the provide great visual references for people unfamiliar with the ranges of clubs, etc. The touchscreen controls for adding time and increasing your card balance is a bit confusing, but it's still fun and the ease-of-use makes extending your play easy (perhaps TOO easy!). Luckily, the staff is incredibly helpful if you have questions on how to use the system. The only complaint some may have is that TopGolf doesn't allow you to swap the tee height, nor do they allow players to bring in their own drivers or hybrids. Apparently, this is to help keep the balls in play, as pre-rule, people spent more time trying to hit the ball out of the range than playing the actual game, itself, and the ability to get under the ball meant a lot of chasing beyond the nets. Once our waiter explained that, I basically stuck to the irons and their 3-hybrid the rest of the day. You ARE allowed to bring your own irons in, though, which is cool, but the clubs they provide are perfectly fine and don't take away from the enjoyment at all. I did find that I didn't get quite as much distance from their clubs as I'm used to, but after a few swings, I simply adjusted to the lack of distance. Also, once you link up your account on their site, you can see your game history, progress, etc. It's a pretty cool!  The food was good. Better than I expected, honestly. We just got a quesadilla, and I got the turkey avocado wrap. The quesadilla was pretty standard, but the wrap was good. Tons of avocado, which I loved! I also downed 3 Texas Mules, which were also good (sorry, no copper mugs here). I'd equate the food to something like Chili's, which is what it is. Perfectly suitable for a golfing/sports bar/drinking experience.  As alluded to briefly, the staff was excellent. Our server (more like all-in-one TopGolf concierge/waiter/pro) was attentive, quick to answer any questions we had and always made sure our waters were topped off, our drinks were replenished and continually checked in to make sure everything was good with our experience.   If I ever find myself back in the Phoenix area, I'll most definitely return. Besides, it would be nice to use the lifetime membership card that they make you buy for $5 again. The one thing to note is that they have 60 bays to play from, but the lines got really long once 11-12 PM rolled around. We got there closer to opening and had no issue getting in, but I can imagine this place gets packed later in the day. Like a regular course, it's nice to get out there early! Although, we hear their nighttime experience is cool.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I tried to go to Topgolf last Saturday, and walked out when I found out my group would have to wait 3+ hours to get a bay. We returned this morning at 11, and got assigned to bay 204. This was my first time at Topgolf, and I was pleasantly surprised at how relaxed and fun it was! The lobby felt claustrophobic (it's small and it seems like there are about 300 people in there at all times), but our bay and the surrounding areas were not crowded at all. We ordered beer and food, and the food was very mediocre. It tasted like bowling alley/bar food. Nothing special. At least the prices weren't egregious.  As a non-golfer, I thought Topgolf was really fun and a great activity to do with a group of friends. The hourly fee seems steep for a single person or a couple, but splitting it between 6 people made it very affordable! I would recommend eating beforehand or after and just getting drinks while playing, since the food was very \"bleh.\" Overall, I had a very fun time and am excited to go back!",

In town for Thanksgiving we had Forbes and Family we all wanted to see and have some entertainment for, half of he party being kids.  Unfortunately I called a day after they had stopped taking party requests but Erica was super helpful on the phone hiding me as to when to call and what to do.  When we arrived, Chris took over and got us what we needed.  The wait was long...remember it was day after Thanksgiving now...so we put our name in, and went to Flo's for Chinese and came back 2 hours later.  Viola...big party leaving...our big party gets the big bays.  Could not have worked any better!  Our server was awesome... can't believe I did not get his name.

The service can definitely be a little slow sometimes but they're handling a lot of bays at once so it's pretty good. The drinks are smaller than what they use to be and more expensive now (the golf bags for three or more people) but they're still good. It's definitely a fun experience and something you need to do if you've never tried. I like being on the top floor when actually playing but it usually has a longer wait. As for wait times they can sometimes run a little crazy once it was over an hour and a half. There are other free games downstairs and jenga and pool to enjoy while you're waiting. There isn't many other places like this in the valley where you can really have an enjoyable outdoor experience!",

Even though I'm the worst at golf, it's always an enjoyable time to hang out with friends, maybe enjoy a nice night outside, drink some alcohol, and hit some golf balls. The music is good and always lively!   It's today's new \"bowling alley\" and I'm so glad they have one in Gilbert now! Can't wait to go to that one and see if it's the same thing as this scottsdale location.   They have two bars, one large bar downstairs and one smaller bar upstairs where the booth/range things are! The downstairs bar is pretty cool to chill with friends while waiting for your table! The bar upstairs is not really needed once you actually get your booth cause the waiter/waitress can take care of your drinks from there!  The food is actually not bad here too! There are a lot of snacks and foods that are easily shareable with more than 6 people! It's gets kinda pricey though so be careful not to over-order at first!   Overall I LOVE Topgolf, and I'll always end up here every so often!  Tips: 1) Go at night! It's wayyyy cooler, and you get to see the neon lights and stuff! 2) If you're going on Friday or Saturday at night, MAKE A RESERVATION ONLINE! It's so easy! Or else you'll have to wait for at least an hour 3) Get the cheese fries, it's probably the best snack food to get there 4) If you're celebrating a birthday or something, call in advance! They can help you set up your booth and stuff if you have balloons, cake, etc  5) The bathrooms are clean here, go ahead and go poop! Hahaha this is always a problem for me cause I hate nasty bathrooms",

If your only experience with golfing is mini-golf.....have no fear! I had NEVER so much as held a proper golf club before and I had an awesome time here acquiring a new skill (the fact that drinks are served here didn't hurt, either!)  I should say...you DO have to get over the inevitable crowd of wandering eyes from neighboring booths as you try to perfect your clearly-my-first-time-golfing swing. Once you get over the stage fright and you actually hit a couple balls, you realize why so many people enjoy golf :)   My group of 5 were having a great time when one of the waitresses came to clear our table of drinks and spilled her entire tray onto the floor, getting shards of glass all over our sandals and flip flops. It was cleaned up very efficiently, but not before we realized my boyfriend had a small cut on his ankle from the glass. Not a huge deal, but it was definitely alarming to see blood, and we were running out of playing time!  Because of this debacle, we had to rush through the last few minutes of our time to complete our second game. Luckily, we were later approached by management; they offered to refund all of our payments made towards playing time and memberships, AND offered us a round of drinks at the bar on the house.   5 thumbs up for going above and beyond to make sure customers are happy. I would definitely return to Topgolf, if I ever happen to be near one in the future!",

The food and cocktails are destination worthy on their own (you have to try the donut holes that come with injectable sauces.)  And everyone from age 5 to 85 can participate.  (I don't even play golf and yet I couldn't help but play a game....and I won!)  There are also pool tables and video games etc for those that prefer to wander around.  And I cannot speak highly enough of the service level; their staff is groomed to perfection.

She absolutely made my evening spectacular and I have already found myself back here again the very next day! If there was such a thing as sever of the year award, this girl would be the absolute most deserving of it... Standing ovation! Topgolf, you have a gem on your hands... Give this girl a raise!",

    "text": "Great concept and really fun experience, but what we were super impressed with was the customer service.  The wait time for our bay was relatively quick for a Saturday afternoon and since it was our first time, everyone was very helpful in explaining how it all worked.  Apparently, something went awry in the kitchen after we ordered and there was a delay with our pitcher of beer and some of our food.  Our waitress was very nice and apologetic and even got her manager to comp the missing food as well as give us some extra playing time - even with no complaining on our part.  I know people complain about the food quality but it really wasn't that bad.  You'll have a great time with great service here!",

    "text": "Overall it was very fun, however the \"negatives\" we experienced during our time here ended up outweighing the \"positive\". We came on a Saturday night, so expectedly there was a wait. Thankfully we found a little area on the bottom floor away from the bar and DJ (because it was SO LOUD we couldn't even hear each other talk...). Didn't realize we not only had to pay to play, but had to pay JUST TO BE THERE (i.e.- required memberships). Once our entire group got set up, a random name appeared on our list so we deleted it and tried reswiping the membership card of who's name didn't show. The card wasn't set up properly. In order to get things straightened out, it took almost 10 minutes that actually counted AGAINST our paid time... time was never reset. Once we got started, it was very fun. Time went by quick but that happens when it's fun! But then once our time was over, a random guy swooped in within SECONDS of our time expiring to kick us out -- \"do you want to add time? Once I close this out, the booth won't be yours anymore\" ... so we told him we'll close out, he told us to have a good night and we left. Once we were outside, we realized we never actually paid anyone. We went back in and found a manager who acted grateful, until they told us to wait and ushered us into the loud bar area. We seriously had to wait 15 minutes to close our check out and didn't even get an apology from the manager. Nothing. Overall very disappointed with the customer service on all levels. 9-9-17 @ 10pm",

The different \"lanes\" on the driving range all had high-top tables or sofas and coffee tables (a better choice for me to sit and chat with others, as I don't golf much, so thanks for putting comfortable furniture out there!), patio heaters and drink service. The golfers in our group really enjoyed it. Our group also had buffet food service, which they don't have a lot of room to set up near the driving ranges, but it mostly worked. My only gripe is our group drink tickets didn't include the wine I wanted and even if I offered to trade all three drink tickets for one glass of what I wanted, they wouldn't do it though that would've worked out financially to their advantage.",

    "text": "Whether you want to 'play' or are serious about working on your swing and ball control - TopGolf is your solution.  The evening experience is a melting pot of the cosmic bowling atmosphere, games similar to darts, but with golf clubs.  Erin and Shawn have touched on this side of TopGolf entertainment in their reviews.  The daylight hours are a great experience as well.  Remember the old saying about mullets - \"business on the top and party in the back\"?  Some are there to have fun, but If you're there to seriously work on your game you will have service better than you'd receive from TCP, Troon or others  The staff are outstanding ( I've had six different bay hosts/hostesses and recommend Valerie or Victoria).   I'm there to work on my game, so the games have little value to me; however, they come in handy for when you are working on placement.    Now, here's the rub - the pricing is really reasonable for the group of 4 to 6 looking for a couple hours of entertainment.  It's not for the individual.  But wait!!!  They have memberships that you can sign up for that the monthly fee is roughly equal to playing for four hours on a pay as you go basis.  They're broken down into three types:  1. EARLY DRIVE - $80/month and you enjoy unlimited range time from 9am to noon, Monday through Friday. 2. LATE NIGHT DRIVE - $100/month and from 10pm to close, Sunday through Thursday, you can play unlimited.  Spend 2.5 hours during this timeframe without a membership would cost you $100 bucks; so, its great for good entertainment on evenings other than Friday and Saturday. 3. DAILY DRIVE - $150/month gets you the unlimited play during the middle of the day to early evening, plus a bonus of $200 in credits towards other time slots.  You won't realize just how reasonable these memberships are until you go and experience TopGolf for yourself.  Whether you are young or old you'll have a great experience!",

From the second you walk in the door the staff was really friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable in helping you figure out how to get situated.  The facilities are incredible, and the bar on the main level is large which makes for a nice sports bar environment. They've also got billiards tables, Xbox Kinect, and Fooseball to make sure that even the kids are entertained when not hitting golf balls.  Having three floors of hitting bays is awesome, and I definitely recommend getting on the top floor. Being able to look out over the field and seeing the targets is really cool. This is definitely no \"driving range\", people that would consider themselves moderate to very good golfers should not need anything close to a driver when hitting balls here (okay, maybe the ladies but definitely not the guys). The experience is more about target shooting and racking up points in their pre-programmed games, not hacking balls as far as you possibly can.  I'll for sure be back at TopGolf, the entertainment value is high for everyone even if you're not into playing the links or taking swings at a regular range.",

    "text": "While there is so much about Scottsdale to love, add to this list a Topgolf location! (Soon coming to my hood, Virginia Beach, VA.) This was a nice way for me to finally experience this before having to wait hours and hours of waiting with the soon to open location in my hometown.  This is an experience. For an avid golfer like myself, I sometimes wonder how things like this will fare on a fun scale. Putt putt golf isn't fun. Could this be a glorified driving range? Not so much. It's really just a fun thing to do, golfer or not. Heck, even if you're not a golfer, you can just come out for food and drinks. Think Dave and Buster's with a golf club.  First, it's gorgeous. Lots of green, lots of lighting, lots of bins so you can have endless groups enjoying their time together. You hit into targets and based on how close you get to your target, you're awarded points. For folks that aren't good at golf and simply make contact, the ground is hard enough where your ball can roll into the hole for points (where golf on a golf course requires you to hit the ball in a specific direction and with hazards and natural terrain, a specific distance), thus making it enjoyable for anyone to score and compete in their many games.  The cool thing about playing at this location in the evening is the Talking Stick Resort in the background. Bright and continuously changing and waving lights emit the building and makes for something pretty to look at with the already pretty golf design of the driving range.  Could this be a weekly adventure for me? I think so. :)",

    "text": "Whether you love golf, hate golf, or just suck at golf (I'm pretty much all three), this place is a blast.  I came here with my siblings for my Dad's birthday upon a recommendation from a co-worker.  Even my sister who never plays golf had fun with us here.    Its not a course mind you, but a driving range with various targets located throughout the range.  The targets are situated at various points from as close as 50 yards to as far as 225 yards.  So no matter what clubs you use or even if you habitually duff your shots, there are still plenty of opportunities to get points.  You can bring your own clubs or rent clubs there.  You pay for a bay at the range by the hour (price varies depending on the time of day) and a computer terminal helps you set up whatever game you want to play with your friends.  We just went with the TopGolf game so we could just let it rip wherever we wanted.  The staff there are incredibly friendly and helped us with any questions we had.  Total cost for a two hour session at our bay on a Saturday morning was $50.  You also have to pay a $5 membership card fee if this is your first time here (once you have your membership card you never have to pay for it again).  Altogether we paid $30 in membership fees.  So split between 5 of us (we didn't let my Dad pay obviously) the total cost per person for our time here was $16.  Considering some actual golf courses charge that much for a single bucket of balls on their driving range, a pretty solid deal.  The driving range has three levels so there's plenty of space (though it was getting busy when we left).  Its shaded and has swamp coolers so its still useful during the summer.  There are also bars at each level serving booze and you can order food from your bay or at the sports bar downstairs (we didn't order any food this time).  If you have a big party or corporate function you could seriously spend hours and hours enjoying yourself here.  In the end my family had a great time and actually my sister beat most of us despite having little golfing experience.  Mark my words, I'll get her back next time.",

Today I carried in my clubs to join a friend for her birthday party and we all had a very positive experience. We all laughed, ate, had a few drinks, and shared a fun time together. While wrapping up our visit, it was my turn to finish up my round.   I grabbed one of my clubs, placed my ball on the tee, and in my back swing, some guy dressed in a football jersey yelled at me and told me that I couldn't use a hybrid or a wood. To a bunch of amateurs who rarely golf, and most of us had never been, we were all left confused with the interaction.  Without staying around to answer questions or clarify, he angrily told us to not use our own clubs and then left.  I honestly thought he was from the bay next to us, then realized he was an employee. We were all left standing there, kind of shocked.   Nobody had said not to use our own clubs. Nobody had explained woods, hybrids, etc. that may seem elementary, but to those of us who don't golf regularly, it came across extremely rude.   Our waitress was very apologetic, and came over and apologized to me and the group. The manager came and expressed similar sentiments. It was such an odd, out of place interaction.   Overall it was a great experience, but for someone who is representing such a great company and establishment who is out of uniform to come and belittle, criticize, and then not try to professionally address the situation, it was very shocking. I can only hope that they move forward without him.",

    "text": "Whether it is for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner this place has been consistent!  I have enjoyed visiting Topgolf every time I have gone.  The place has just recently opened but it seems their kinks are getting worked out better and better with each visit.  I would suggest 6 people per bay because of space and time to play.  Food and drinks are awesome and well prepared!    Word to the wise if your planning on visiting for your first time.. Go online to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftopgolf.com&s=89fad08644382c8f74bf0fe484c4ba6018f8d150e54695e48bdf55834f41c76b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">topgolf.com</a> and register for a membership.  It costs $5 which is the same for in store purchase however, it will SAVE you A LOT of time.  If you register online you can walk in and they will print the membership card right away.  Just be sure to have you RE # from the confirmation email!   This is a great place to visit for all ages.  I just recently was there with my twin brother and sister ages 4 and my 83 year old grandmother.  Everyone hit balls and had a great time!  Weekends are certainly the busiest so plan ahead.  Even in this 100 degree weather they have all the bays chilled with fans and misters.",

Handicappers on all levels have dreamed of a place like this. Grab a beer, an iron of your choosing and let the games begin. Pinpoint tracking of your ball down to the foot and inventive games preprogrammed for quick play.   Looking forward to joining in their tournaments throughout the year.

    "text": "We had heard a lot about how fun Top Golf is. Having never swung a golf club in my life (other than in a couple of mini golf outings), I was skeptical about how much fun it could possibly be for a non-golf enthusiast. We decided to give it a shot for my hubby's (also a non-golfer) birthday and we had a great time. We paid $5 for the lifetime membership card and put our name in to rent out a bay for five of us. At $45 per hour, it was a great deal. We waited in the bar area for a little over an hour (we arrived at about 9:45pm) before we got the text that our bay was ready.  Gameplay was fun, even though four-fifths of our group were novices. We signed up for an hour of play and extended for another 30 minutes as the original window neared its close. The servers were friendly and attentive; we never had to worry about running out of drinks as they returned to check on us often. Highly recommended as an out-of-the-ordinary night of fun.",

    "text": "I was super stoked about this place from the beginning. It brought a new light to golf that was for everyone in the family even if you aren't a golfer. The staff nows how to personalize your experience and make sure that you are well taken care of.  I was very excited to be part of the platinum membership. I have never waited for a bay and the platinum host when they are around remember your name and are always in a great mood  and there to make sure your receive a great experience.  The reason I am only giving them 3 out of 5 stars is not reflective of the staff but more so in the fact that there has been several limitations since they opened with being a driving range.  Since they opened they cut off tee's .... Not a big deal.. Then a month later without any warning to their members they would no longer allow any Driver, Woods, or Hybrids?? Apparently they underestimated the Golfer's in PHX.  SUPER BAD PLANNING.  In order to rectify this for the members the did refund us for one month because of the new rules that went into effect.  However, the following month I was charge with nothing changed. I put a call into the General manager whom I had a conversation with prior, informing her that going fourth I think the way TopGolf handled this situation the new club rules mad me feel like I was a little kid and not trusted, and not informed which we all should of been rather then walking up to the facility and being asked to return our clubs to our cars in the 115 degree weather..  I do want to point out that their are some amazing staff that does work their and makes my 25 minute drive across town worth it!!   The General manager was kind enough to refund me for another month which I feel I truly appreciated.  It has now been nearly 2-3 months and not much has changed as far as the rules go and in fact seem to of gotten worse..  For awhile now if I brought my own clubs I was again told without any prior information that I would only be allowed to use my own clubs on the bottom floor..  This to me made TopGolf, more of an inconvenience and absolutely not worth the membership.. But I do want to mention again that I was originally charged for this month but then after speaking to the general mgr it was refunded.  I was told that I was see some changes very soon. The only things so far is they changed the balls which now have a horrible and not realistic golf bounce and we are again able to use ONLY OUR IRONS on all floors makes it tough to call this place a driving range at all.. It is still a great place to entertain and have fun but if you are coming her to really practice your game save it for a real course and driving range  I truly love the concept of this biz but because of extremely poor planning and lack of organization I am at the point where if i am not allowed to use my other clubs very soon I no longer feel as though paying out $250 a month is worth the time and effort to go to TopGolf.  Hope they get there act together real quick or else I feel they are going to lose many more fans and members of this great Biz venture.",

We were told our wait for a golf spot was 30 minutes.  So we went to the bar to have a drink.  We sat at a dirty table that never got bussed for over an hour while we waited for our golf lane that was only supposed to be a 30 minute wait.  Not only that, but no one took our order for 20 minutes, then only served us one drink and we never saw them again.  It took us going to get a front desk staffer to find our waiter to close out our bar tab.  We were so frustrated that we ended up asking for a refund and leaving.",

Super cool how you rent for the hour and can hit as many balls as you like in that time. An hour is a perfect amount of time for everyone to get their golfness out and feel a little sore the next day. I don't remember which hamburger I got but it was the one with the egg on it. It was awesome. Fries were great. I would have gotten my hamburger a little more rare next time. Loved it though.",

Server was very inattentive, and rude.

Or you might be a vampire. Or dead.  Either way, this is basically a sports bar meets a three-story driving range, which, yes, is about as cool as it sounds. I don't even like playing golf and I had a good time. The food was pretty typical, but the drink selection was better than your average sports bar. My only real complaints would be not enough seating in the private golf areas and a little too long of a wait time in between server visits.  Again, worth checking out if you're looking for a fun, unique experience with a good group of friends.",

Never has it been bad, but they went above and beyond to make a great experience!

There wasn't one when we got there so we went and had a snack in the bar, nachos were great! I just kept checking in with the front and they kept me updated on what I needed to do to get our bays together!  We got up in our bays at the time we expected with everyone together and our server Brian came right over introduced himself and got us all waters and other drinks started!  As the night went on he took really good care of us and it did get a little warm and I noticed one of the fans wasn't spinning on our side of the bays so I had asked a lady named Michelle if there was anything we could do right away she called maintenance for us and they did the best they could for the fan to be in the middle of each bay and not just on one! She was super nice and made sure there wasn't anything else we needed!  We absolutely love Top Golf, the people, the food, and the fun! :)",

    "text": "I haven't golfed in many many years, not due to lack of desire, but sometimes you just don't make it out on the course.  I have, however, been to Topgolf a few times over that time, and been able to swing and whack and take out some frustrations.  I was in rare form the other night, and it was made even more special by being with some work peeps and being in an outdoor facility in mid-November. Someone turned on the heater halfway through the night which did make it more comfortable, but I was surviving jut fine without it.  I'm a bad golfer, but in that rare form I did manage to get a hold of a few. The good news is, you can be as serious or as silly as you want--there are all kinds.  We ordered some grub, which is nice to have at the handy, and some folks were imbibing, as that's available from their bar and served up at your bay.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time on Saturday night (3/10/18) with 8 other folks and had a blast.  Here are my quick thoughts on a few things about Top Golf..................  - Be prepared to wait!  2.5 hour wait on a Saturday afternoon (4pm).  Finally got into our bay at about 6:45 or so.  They do text you before your bay is ready, so if you want to go somewhere else and come back, you can.  We just chilled upstairs and played Jenga and chilled the whole time.  The wait is fine if you are with a group, but would be a deal breaker (for me at least) if it was just you and another person on a date or something.  2.5 hours is a LONG TIME to wait for something.  - Incredible service!  Everyone from the bartenders to the front desk, to the managers on duty, to the person assigned to your bay.  Everyone was friendly, helpful and overall in a good mood!  - Food was decent.  We got some chips/salsa/guacamole and some pretzel bites and they were all tasty.  Reasonably priced, too.  I got a Pepsi and it came with free refills all night.  - The Golf.  That's the reason you came here, right?  The golfing part of it was fun.  You can play a slew of different \"games\" and the computer does the scoring for you.  Purchase a membership card for a one time fee of $5.00.  Otherwise, it doesn't keep score or track your progress.  -  Sensors on the balls seemed a bit \"off\".  We played a game of \"Top Drive\" and my one buddy was crushing the shit out of the ball into the intended targets, but it was not registering.  Meanwhile, I can't drive worth a damn, and was hitting maybe 140 yards, and was getting credit for scoring points.  Something was up.  Still fun, but not an accurate scoring system to tell us who actually won.  - If possible, get a bay on the 2nd or 3rd floor.  We got ours on the first floor all the way down at the end (Bay 102) which was a little whack.  All the scoring targets were at an angle, and since you were on the bottom floor, it was hard to judge and sometimes even see the actual target you were aiming at.  It would be much, much better up top looking down.  - Price.  $50.00 an hour on weekends after 5pm.  Seems a bit steep, but when you divide it by your party, it comes out very reasonable.  There were 5 of us that split the cost so for almost 2.5 hours, plus membership, it was only like $30.00 each.  I felt that was very reasonable for the amount of fun we had.  Go during the week and you can get it as low as $25.00 an hour.  Overall, I had a great time.  The wait to get a bay and the sensors (occasionally) were my only complaints.  Good times...so much so, I am coming back sometime this week with my other friends that are coming out for Spring Training.  Can't wait!",

They sent us to our bay right away.  When we got up stairs and found our bay there was someone there to help us. We swiped our playing cards and there was 4 time slots you can choose from to play 1) 30 mins 2) 45 mins 3) 1 1/5 mins 4) 2 hrs. We chose an hour & half. We got to play 3 1/2 games but there was 9 of us.   We ordered the 24 injectable doughnut holes & you can pick 2 creams. We choose bavarian cream & chocolate. They were both really good. Also we ordered the signature nachos it was so delicious & definitely not enough for all of us that we had to order another one.   They have seating up stairs. They have games like pool & Kinect & etc.",

One thing I had to give them right away is that it's a very beautiful facility. The wrap around covered seating with spritzing fans all facing a colored light up green grassy range. It was almost like being at Disneyland.. almost.  I have to agree with other reviewers that this place is not just for the golf show offs, it's a great place for anyone and definitely a fun experience for group outings. We had about 25 of us with only a couple decent golfers in the mix. Many of us ladies had to take off our high heels when it was our turn, and a few even sent the ball flying in directions that seemed to defy physics.   The servers were very attentive and kept the drinks flowing all night long, which definitely improved my golf game, or at the very least made me care less when I swung with purpose and totally missed the ball.. what can I say guys, I got skillz. Ordering food here was a little more challenging for a VIP allergy member of the glutenisgross club. There was definitely a lot of uncertainty when I first asked about gf options, and when they brought me out a stapled paper packet with allergy info there was nothing gf on the menu. Even the shrimp cocktail had gluten..Perfect. I was almost to the point of ordering an Uber eats meal when luckily a concerned server came over. He said he'd heard I have celiac and could ask the kitchen to just grill me some chicken served with sliced avocado and corn tortillas off menu. This guy saved the day cause I was morphing into hangry golfer, much more dangerous and unpredictable.   With snacks on board, drinks supplied at a steady pace, and some fab Backstreet Boys jams that led to some interpretive dance with the girls, this ended up being a fine Phoenix night.",

    "text": "Have you ever been to a bowling alley, but wondered if it could be golf-focused? That is top golf in a nutshell. It isn't cheap, about 35 bucks per hour but it's nice to practice and you can go with nothing and the wrong clothes  and zero experience and still have fun.  I went with my dad, an accomplished golfer and he loved it. You can aim for a target that your skill level can hit and earning points for your shots is cool. The view of the mountains is pretty spectacular too.   It's also great for kids, there's a game room on the lower level for them and a bar mid-level for the adults. Drinks and food are hella pricey. That's snottsdale for you though.  You can bring your own clubs but they have ones there that are decent too.",

From the golfing competition (apparently once someone initiates this part of the game, you get NEGATIVE points for getting your ball in the wrong hole, thanks for telling me guys), to the tasty margaritas, this was a great experience and a very cool alternative to a normal recruitment dinner.  The only thing - I wasn't much of a fan of the food.  We had some standard Mexican fare (tacos, etc.), but after having cheap legitimate Mexican taco-truck food for years, I wasn't too impressed.  I'll have to try the sushi or some other dish next time.",

I had a bloody Mary, that was fantastic, to get the day started.    You should visit their website for details, but they charge by the hour.  And depending on the time of day, the price per hour increases as the day progresses.  We went in the morning at the $25 an hour rate.    There are a variety of different games one can play.    The food was surprisingly good.  My only issue with this place is the lack of \"scalable\" fun.  How about small kids?  I know a gang of pre schoolers would love to play golf there, but they probably would never get a ball in a target.  Docking TG a star for that .",

    "text": "After having heard many stories of how much fun my friends have had at Topgolf, I was really excited to finally get a chance to play. We had gone on a Saturday afternoon so there was a little bit of a crowd, however the wait time to get a bay was much shorter then I expected. The cost at the time we went was $35/hour; since we were splitting it 8 ways, it was very affordable.  Our bay was on the second floor towards the end so we got an area with a table and couches. My only qualm with this was that it was a little bit uncomfortable because we all had ordered food, and we felt that it would've been easier if we would've had a high top table and chairs (I wonder if you can request a bay that has that?). The great part was that our waitress was on point in getting us food & drink refills quickly & made some good suggestions. The price of the food was about what I expected & everything we got was tasty. I recommend the smores!!  It's a good thing that we were just playing for fun because the scoring system is a little awkward. Sometimes someone would hit a really good shot and it would not go into one of the scoring zones so they're get 0 points & the next person would hit not as good of a shot but the ball would keep rolling and land in a high scoring zone. I'm not good at golf so I didn't have high expectations for myself. I thought lowest points normally wins in golf anyways, right?  All and all, it was a really good time so we'll be back!",

Tonight 6 of us went to the restaurant and for the most part it was ok for the other people in our group, food was good and there were no complaints.  I however cannot say the same.  I told the waiter I wanted the fried chicken sandwich with no cilantro coleslaw on it.  I'm sure he heard me because he nodded his head and said \"No coleslaw\" and I said yes.  Low and behold it was delivered with the coleslaw.  I should have sucked it up and ate it, but I HATE COLESLAW!  Waiter apologized and took it back and promptly forgot about me.  I waited 40 minutes to get my sandwich with no coleslaw on it.  When it arrived I declined to take it.  Everyone else was done eating, and I was a bit upset about it and had lost my appetite by then.  Luckily I grabbed the Tator tots of the original plate to tie me over.  Only problem...they were very cold.  Manager stopped by and apologized I accepted his apology and he said that he would take care of it for us.  Cool!  Well that didn't happen.  We got the check and lo and behold they charged us for the chicken sandwich.  I told the waiter I was not going to pay for something I didn't eat.  He took it off the bill then.  Not acceptable.",

Our group reserved two sections on the second deck. Walking to our location, I was already impressed by the vastness of the facility, with multiple levels of folks driving their balls off into the horizon and a massive bar inside where people caroused and watched sports. Our section consisted of some comfy furniture, driving greens with a cool laser-operated ball feeder and some handy electronic scoreboards. My game didn't improve much, but I had a blast and our friendly servers kept the green beer (it was St. Patrick's Day) and tasty apps flowing.   This mixture of low key athleticism, socializing and drinking make Topgolf a perfect spot for a date, a group outting or a solo meditation getaway. I just hope they eventually open a branch in my neck of the woods!",

They showed us how to use the system and within minutes Austin was taking our drink order. Drinks and appys were served quickly. The presentation on all of the food is awesome.  We ordered the bacon Mac and cheese spring rolls, the buffalo chicken sliders, quesadillas, and a sunrise burger. Everything was so scrumptious! Many items on the menu are perfect for sharing.

I don't know what I was doing with the past 35 years of my life, but I do know it all sucked compared to my time at Topgolf. This place is the shiz.  When we arrived we were escorted to our reserved stations, which had climate-controlled couch seating in the back, and some pretty dang high-tech tees up in the front. The system is able to scan a sensor in your golf ball and if you hit one of their targets, you get points! Matt Fact: I LOVE POINTS! It's my philosophy that everything in life is a competition, some more obvious than others. If I'm able to objectively show that I scored more points than somebody else, then I'm having a pretty great day.   While waiting for your turn, you can hang back with pretty good food and drink, brought to you be a server. I was particularly fond of the Palomas, and all of the bites I sampled were tasty.   This would be a great date, double date, friend outing, or company team builder. I can't wait until they open a location closer to my home in Portland.",

I must preface this review by saying - I am NOT a golfer. Sure, I've taken a few swings here and there. And I can play a pretty mean game of putt-putt/min-golf, but driving ranges aren't really my jam. That being said, me and my novice crew all had a blast swinging and drinking away while soaking up the glorious Arizona sunset.  Food and drinks were surprisingly top-notch. Our hungry crew noshed on an assortment of small bites, including: queso + chips, pot stickers/dipping sauce; bruschetta; and other gourmet goodies. And i must admit, the drinks weren't too shabby either. I had a few Old Fashioned cocktails and they were well-balanced and strong (perhaps that is why my golf game kept getting better?). : )  All in all, Topgolf was a great way to finish off our day in Scottsdale.

I recommend booking in advance if you can....there was a sizable line at the entrance. Clearly, this place is popular! Anyone can play Topgolf, from aspiring pros to those who've never held a gold club. All you had to do is try! It's likely you'll have a great time. It's basically a driving range, full service bar/pub and arcade all in one! You might never want to leave. It's pretty addicting and I think I scored a grand total of 18 points. The food was pretty darned good too. Bites and sips are similar to what you'd find at a gastropub. We snacked on shareables like guacamole, queso and shrimp. For those that opt out from the golf game...there's plenty of seating to kick back and relax. I'll be back! But can you please open a Topgolf in Tucson? I'll even settle for Marana :)",

When we first got there, there was some confusion and we were not only switched 3 times but then we had to switch \"lanes\" one more time after our final spot was not working. Would have given less stars if a manager hadn't come to us and given us an extra hour. We each ordered a couple of appetizers and they were all good. My favorite was the pickle fries and even the macaroni and cheese fried with bacon was good. We had a good time. The only thing I would tell someone going is that it might be worth a wait to go higher up. The holes light up and night and it might be part of the fun to be able to see them better. (But not sure it's worth a 3 hour wait which is what we hear it is sometimes.)",

The game was sooo much fun!!! I don't play golf and I had a blast. We played on the first level but next time we'll ask for the 2nd level.  We'll def be coming back this summer!!! If your wondering what to wear, wear comfy, casual clothes and sneakers. Have fun!!",

Our hitting station have a 5 seat high top or I could have request a sofa seating about the same number, we have our own TV with the college football on and a screen for everyone to see the hitter scores and distances. I had a great time the 30 minute flew by, I will be back with friends for some friendly competition! The food & drink were reasonable prices but prices per hour do go up the later in the day you visit, but if you are splitting it 3-4 ways it's not bad, depending on how much beer you drink!",

I went with 3 other people and we had a great time. The staff there was really nice and friendly and very accommodating. The food and drinks were great. The atmosphere was awesome too, I mean it can't get better being at a driving range where everyone is drinking and having a good time. The bucket specials are pretty sweet (spent $20 for 6 leinenkugel sunset   wheat). If you go with a group it's easy to split the cost of things. Top gold offers various game options at the driving range that keep players amused. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would recommend this place to friends trying to do something different on the weekend or even during the week.",

Upon arriving there was a line out the door. I expected it to be busy since they opened recently. Fletcher at the membership desk was EXTREMELY helpful getting all my friends their memberships cards. We then were helped by David at the main desk and asked if we could get two spots next to each other to accommodate our party of 8. I had heard that it can take over an hour to get a spot but within 30 minutes David had fit us in and got us started. The whole experience was amazing and we all had a great time. Even my friends that had no golfing experience had a blast. I will be returning very soon and can't wait to try the other games we didn't have time for. I feel like the longer they are open the smoother the whole process will become but will recommend TopGolf to everyone I know. Thank you for making it such a great experience!",

    "text": "Apparently they are very busy even on a Tuesday night, I tried to call multiple times but the automatic recording kept on telling me that all staff members are busy, so I was kept on hold. Finally got fed up and had to email them to ask my question. I work as a ER nurse at a hospital a few miles away from Topgolf, and a few patients told me about it so I decided we would give it a try for my boyfriends birthday. One patient had told me that they do not allow you to bring in a birthday cake, unless you spend the extra money and plan an event. I figured this wasn't True.....since every restaurant, amusement park, bowling alley ect. I've ever been to lets you bring in birthday cakes.  The Topgolf website says no outside food or drinks, which I think it completely appropriate EXCEPT FOR BIRTHDAY CAKE/CUPCAKES! I received an email from Topgolfs Senior Events Coordinator Lauren Colvin, confirming that you are not allowed to bring birthday cakes ( I did not email her, what a coincidence the person that responded to my email is the person who books the events). I then called Topgolf again a few days later, and the lady who answered the phone said you can bring in your own birthday cake, if you pay the extra money to plan an event. I'm not sure if anyone has looked at the prices for events but they are expensive......and do not include alcohol. I sent out an Evite over a month ago, informing our friends and family that we are planning on going to TopGolf as walk-in guest and celebrating my boyfriends birthday. Last count there will be over thirty people, who are planning on eating, drinking, and playing golf. So now the dilemma is do I changed the party to somewhere more accommodating for birthdays entirely? Or go there and golf for an hour and then hold the celebration elsewhere where they allow you to actually personalize the birthday experience? This might not bother other people like it does me, but I do believe it is important fact to know before planning on celebrating your birthday at Topgolf.",

You are better off going to play mini golf, or going to an actual golf course. Service was below average from the staff. Our server at our bay semi yelled at us to give him all our cards, then must have seen the look on my face and changed his tone.",

Service was okay, nothing spectacular but just right. And then it came to the end of our time, we decided to not add more as we had other plans. We still had five minutes left and a large group was walked up to our bay and the employee stated loudly \"they have 307 and 308.\" This created a very awkward experience for all involved as we still had time on our game as well as food and drink to finish. The group then just stood there and hovered over us waiting for us to finish. There were at least 8 bays around us empty that were next to each other that they could've been sat at. Our server started to rush us by trying to clear plates that still had food on them and then told us \"there's a reservation waiting for this bay\" like we were unaware. Very uncomfortable and unprofessional situation that was completely avoidable.",

So, she asks the manager, she enters a different number...nope, doesn't work. We offer to pay $50 cash...nope! The last time we were there our tab was $400+ with 6 of us! Imagine 10 of us. Unbelievable! I've been there several times and will NEVER GO BACK! UNBELIEVABLE!",

Everything was perfect but above all the service we received was outstanding. It began from the initial phone call, we were working with Dulia who helped plan the event. My husband who had recently undergone surgery was not feeling well the day we had first selected for our event. I had to call Dulia the morning of the event to see if it would be possible to reschedule. She was so kind and understanding and was able to move our event to the following weekend. When we arrived to the event we were assigned to Mary Kate who did an outstanding job of getting us set up, drinks and food. She was wonderful and couldn't have done a better job not to mention how sweet she was to work with. The Manager came by to introduce himself and to make sure everything was going well. We also met the Events Coordinator who made a point to stop by. If your looking for a great place to have a celebration this TopGolf location is a great place. We are definitely going again.",

We came this Sunday at 10AM for brunch with 6 people & it wasn't crowded at all, service was good, beers were $3 ea, & we got the queso which was yummy. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is it is a bit pricey per hour of golfing, it can get up to $45/hour depending on when you go. That's why I always go with a group so you can split it a few ways.",

If anyone complains about the wait, that's the price you pay for a fun time at a hugely popular place like TopGolf.  I have played in Japan at the multi tier driving ranges. This is a league all its own.   The food is what you would expect. The quality of the golfer DOES NOT MATTER. TopGolf is the great equalizer. You come here to have fun or brag and show your skills or lack of, hahahaha.  Go and have a good time with friends and family. The more you have the better the time you will experience.   What a great time for team building events.  Office outings. A wonderful low pressure place where all players are great golfers.   Have fun we did.",

When you golf I recommend the second floor in the middle cause it's not to high not to low just right and the bar is right behind you too ....all around service from the moment you walk up everyone is very professional very helpfully if you need anything or have any questions anyone will help you NOT brush you off or be rude so I will definitely be back and recommend TopGolf to everyone I know this will be a weekly stop for me and my friends  cause of the amazing service and good food thank you TopGolf .If you see my other reviews it's very hard for me to give a 5 stars and i am very picky on food because I was a restaurant manager so I know how the kitchen and food and services and bar should be and you guys are top quality all around ...thank you server KAT ...because of you we will be back weekend and we will be requesting you as our server ever time if your there .....",

We were a little annoyed because the employee at the bay reservation desk told us that it is currently an \"iron only facility\" so when you bring your own clubs you have to hit off the first deck and you can't bring your driver to the bay. Apparently people have been hitting balls over the net. They offered to check the clubs you weren't allowed to bring but we just ran them back to the car. They should have emailed members and posted signage but they did not.   Our bay was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. Took a few minutes for our server to get there, but she finally brought us waters and we ordered a round of mimosas. Those also took a while to get there -- her reasoning was because they had just opened and so things weren't ready yet (not an excuse). Mimosas were more like a glass of OJ with a splash of champagne which sucked.   Overall golfing experience was fun. They provide rental clubs at each bay if you don't have any. Definitely come for the experience. It's a very cool place.",

If you don't order drinks right away, don't expect to see your server or any drinks for 10 minutes. Considering that people are paying by the hour 10 minutes is 15% of your time (if you are there for an hour). I usually go in the middle of the day, so I don't think its too crowded eithere to where this can be warranted.   You don't really notice that when its your turn to hit, but if you are sitting there waiting for your turn, its nice to have a drink in hand.",

    "text": "We typically come here several times a month for brunch in the bar area. Normally, everything is great; however, today's experience was the worst and is worth mentioning. We walked into the bar, which was not busy, and we're not greeted for ten minutes. We actually had to stand up and flag someone down for service. Danielle, our server, came over and took our order (both drink and food). Another 15 minutes goes by, and she brings water. Then we wait another ten for mimosa and Chip Shot. Food comes, I ask for more butter - doesn't arrive from Danielle until end of meal. We ordered a refill of both drinks and they don't arrive. She comes to check on food, I told her it would be better with drinks. She failed to even put them in!! Then, she clears our plates, we ask for the tab. Another ten minutes goes by and she does bring out check, she's reading a book behind the bar with the other bartender!  Again, we had to get up to get her attention. Horrible server and service. Jim, the manager, said he's going to get \"actively involved.\"   I sincerely hope you do.",

    "text": "Awesome for the golf portion. The games are fun, and it's a great thing to do with friends who do golf, and those who don't too! However I've been here numerous times now and have had consistently HORRIBLE bar service. Literally we sat at a bar with a group of five for over 20 minutes without so much as an acknowledgement! I had to walk to the other side of the bar to ask for someone to come over, and we still waited over five more minutes for anyone to come over to us.   Weekends are busy so you might encounter a wait, which is fine. But the hosts don't communicate to you how much time that wait may be. They just simply say \"ok, we will text you when it's ready\". No confirmation that they have the correct phone number and no estimated wait time. Being in customer service for so long, I was very disappointed in this. Communication is key!!   Bay service is very hit or miss. Food is actually pretty good, I've tried a few things and have always enjoyed it. I've had Mike C. as a bay host twice now, and he has been the best!   Tournaments are extremely unorganized. It goes back to the communication thing though, apparently their system went down, but they didn't communicate that to anyone, so instead everyone just sat waiting for almost an hour. It ended up being almost 6 hours, which was far longer than anyone expected. They were busy, so maybe the staff just wasn't prepared, but the service was horrible in the bays we were assigned during the tournament. I actually sat in a bay for 45 minutes and not once did a server come to offer drinks or anything, so I ended up just opening a tab at the bar and walking to get my drinks for the rest of the time we were there.   Overall I think there is a lot of room for improvement. Especially since it is an established business with numerous locations, I think I had higher expectations for them! Hopefully they will work the kinks out, because it really is a fun place to go. It's nice to have something different as an option for entertainment.",

First I want to say how beautiful the view is. The mountains in the background are amazing especially from the third floor. We were there in the evening and also ordered food. The food is OK nothing gourmet. The service was good though the waitress is very prompt and polite. The golf game itself was a lot of fun and the set up of the course is really cool. As the sun goes down the view gets even better between the sunset and the way the course gets lit up combined with the view of the very colorfully lit casino in the background. I'm giving top golf in Phoenix Arizona four out of five stars because the views are amazing the game is fun but the food is just OK if the food was awesome I probably would've given it five stars honestly. Can't wait to go to top golf back at home and take my husband now that I know what a fun experience it is. I think this is more fun with a group then just one or two people would be.",

You get points for the different shots that you make and you compete against the people with you. I don't even go to the driving range too often and it was still very entertaining.   There are 3 floors that you can play on. We were on the first floor and while you play, there is music and tv's that keep you entertained while you are waiting for your turn.  I went with some guys from my office and we played for 2 hours. We all had a great time and competed against each other for bragging rights. It's a great place to relax, hit some golf balls, drink some beer, and eat some good food.  We ordered the chips and guacamole, the flatbread pizza, the buffalo chicken rolls, and the chicken quesadillas. Overall the food was very good. Not to mention they have a good beer selection on tap and bottles.  They also have pool tables and shuffle board inside if you want to hang out and drink after your game is over.   Unfortunately I am only visiting Scottsdale, so I won't be able to return for a bit, but if I'm back in town, I will definitely come back.  If you're looking for a place to hang out and have fun with friends or have a birthday party/ celebratory get together, TopGolf is a great place for that.",

We were greeted with smiling faces and welcoming staff. Our server (really wish we remembered her name) was lovely, consistently refilling drinks and having fun making conversation. We ordered the cheese dip, wings, and flat breads. ALL THREE ARE A MUST. If you are looking for a great deal on beer, their buckets are a amazing! Personally, I had the Topgolf Tea and the Tipsy Palmer. So refreshing on a hot day. The actual concept of Topgolf is so fun, you don't have to be good at golf to have an awesome time. We finished our night with a hospitality guest service manager, Michelle! She was professional and friendly, and we will definitely be back to see her. Great energy and just so excited about her job and the company she works for! Overall, can't get much better than Topgolf!",

We waited in that line for aprox. 20 mins before getting to the counter. At the counter they were having difficulties with the computer and it took another 20-30 mins to check all of us in. During the check in process I asked a friend of mine to go check on bays for us at the concierge desk.  She was told at the concierge that we could not check in without having everyone's players cards present. (Prior to going to the venue I had purchased to 2 VIP passes so that we could prevent the waits and be moved to the front of the line for bays.) Once we had everyone's players card the concierge then let us check in for bays. They told us that if we wanted the 2nd or 3rd floor that it would still be about an hour or two wait for us even with the VIP passes. So we opted to take the first available. They put us on the first floor in bay 102 and 103. Someone from Topgolf brought us to our bays and showed us how to use the computers. That was extremely helpful... but then we noticed that there were only 5 and 6 clubs in each of the bays. I went up to the front desk and asked that they brought us more clubs and was told someone would be down there right away. That NEVER happened. I went back up to the front desk and requested clubs again and still no one came. The golf itself was fun, but we would not return to this venue. If we want to hit balls, we will go to a regular driving range and save on the headache of the crowd, the lack of organization and be able to use multiple clubs.",

    "text": "I went to TopGolf yesterday for my boyfriend's birthday. We got there around 5:30. We had to get in line to get our one time membership card. After that we had to go to the concierge desk to set up our time to play. The wait was around an hour and 15 minutes. Parking was full but we lucked out and got one fairly close to the facility. The concept is really cool. The main thing that stood out to me is all the other activities people can do to entertain themselves while waiting. That made the wait time bearable. The actual game was so much fun!! $45/hour isn't too bad when you're splitting it with a group of friendz. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open since it's right down the street from me!!",

It's first come first serve so we quickly sat down at a table when people left. Took 5 minutes before someone actually greeted us only to get her money that was left at the table and then leave. She came back 5 minutes later to ask us what we wanted to drink and when I asked if someone could wipe off the table she tells us that if we sit at a dirty table they assume that it's our mess... WTH?!?   Gave two stars for the food which was good... But took forever! Had the nachos and chicken and waffles sliders.   For as many servers there are tables don't understand why they are so slow and so unfriendly.",

Our group of 3 ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad, along with the Thanksgiving Burger, the Veggie Sandwich, and the Crab Cake Sandwich. Everything was absolutely awesome. One of the better crab cakes I've ever had--what a pleasant surprise!   Great music selection, and even for me--a non-golfer--I was entertained. Misters and fans abound so you're sure to stay cool even in the heat of summer. Service was friendly, fast, and attentive. I found Top Golf to be an upscale-bowling-alley-meets-driving-range and I absolutely loved it. Original, fun, engaging, trendy.  I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "We went here for my husband's 50th birthday party on a Saturday afternoon. We picked this place because my husband loves golf, and my SIL had gone to a Top Golf for a corporate event, and had had a great time. We paid $151 for 3 hours and 7 membership cards), plus another $95 for food/drinks.  We were a party of 7 initially, growing to 10 by the time stragglers arrived. We had an issue in signing up where the printer died, and I had to wait while they got me all the membership cards, etc. What I didn't realize was that even though I had waited in line and paid, I was not yet on the waiting list for a bay. Getting on the wait list happens in a second line at the Concierge Desk. I was pretty upset when I found out that multiple groups who had come in after me who had not gotten stuck with a nonworking printer had now gone over and signed up for bays ahead of me. (I was frustrated that the front desk agent didn't suggest I go over and sign up and then come back to get the remainder of the cards.)   It was my husband's party and I wanted it to be perfect, so I over-reacted just the slightest bit. I asked for a manger. Kudos to them, they handled my over-reaction very professionally and diplomatically. I felt embarrassed afterwards (sorry, guys!), but my husband had a wonderful time, didn't think about all the many pressures in his life once during the entire visit, and I am very grateful for how they handled the situation.   We had a bay for 3 hours ($35/hour). And I will say the 3 hours flew by! Six people can play at one bay at a time, but you can remove/add players at any time. In my opinion, a single bay can really only accommodate 7-8 people with any comfort (max 4 on the couch, 3 at the high top table behind the couch, and 1 player). So if you have more, you probably want two bays. We were lucky enough not to have anybody else in the bay next to us, and, of course, we spilled over to their area.  They have different games you can play by hitting the ball into targets in the range. We weren't serious gamers/golfers (well, except for my husband and his father!) and just had fun hitting the ball. From a total experience perspective, the evening is probably the better time to go because the targets are lit up. But I think the the daytime is a little more low key (less crowded, less wait time). As many have said before, they don't allow drivers or hybrids currently because some players have put balls in the neighboring parking lot. Hopefully they will fix this soon, but you can still have fun without those clubs. They do allow you to bring/use your own irons.  Our event administrator was excellent (Christine). We brought in a birthday cake, which I was afraid would be an issue (bringing in outside food), but nothing was said (thank you!). And we certainly ordered enough drinks and food to make a good tab.   They have some kinks to work out yet in their processes (like being sensitive to people not wanting to wait longer than they absolutely have to!). But I would recommend this place for a fun party for anybody whether they play golf or not. Maybe a little more fun for the golfer, but nongolfers can certainly enjoy cheering and heckling (did I just reveal something about my family?). My husband and I talked about how much fun this place would be with some of the golfers we play with, so I think we'll be back (either here or one of the other sites they are in process of opening).  The one thing that was a little frustrating was understanding the scoring system. Sometimes a shot that hit the target didn't register at all, sometimes the same shot would have different scores. (This was mainly a problem for the competitive and analytical among us!) Personally, I think this problem is solved with just a little more alcohol!",

We all order food at once  so we wouldn't confuse  him. He had a smile  on his face but knew something  was wrong. Only 3 plates  showed  up when good came and when wr ask him where the rest was he replied  by saying he forgot. An average  drink took about 15 min.  And we had to hunt our server down for our  tab.

However, why should I pay for golf for people who will not be there. They refused to reduce the price of the event. We were willing to consolidate to fewer bays so they could rent them out to any of the hundreds of people waiting in the lobby to play. They said I needed to give them 7 days notice. How are you supposed to plan for the flu??? I booked the event from 4-6 PM. However, they took the food away at 5:30.

But I see about 5 bays with hackers swinging their drivers.  I inquire about the obvious inconsistency with 2 different staff members and their response was \"oh I'm sure the manager will tell them to stop.  There's nothing we can really do about that.\"    But they insist I walk my clubs back to the car and stow my hybrids.  REALLY?  My son who is 4 wanted to use his driver so he hit a whopping 30 yards.  Nope she said everyone is held to the same standards.

I saw at least 3 other kids with their drivers and no one telling them to put it away.  When we finally got to our bay, the \"concierge\" guys said \"I woulda let your little guy use his driver...the rule is totally stupid.\"  And so I'm thinking...oh so the rule is dependent on who sees you walk into the door.  Take my advice...sneak in your drivers all you want.  I should have.    The waitress service was nice and prompt.  Food was better than expected.  Facility in top condition.

    "text": "So I told my boyfriend about this amazing heaven on earth place in Chicago called Topgolf.  Sadly, the closest one to Los Angeles is in Scottsdale, AZ. Of course, after telling him about it, the only right thing to do was drive there.  And it was awesome!  Due to the drive, we arrived kinda late, close to 8 pm.  I would suggest getting there early because it's THE happening spot. Even though there were a lot of people, the process was smooth.  There was valet, but my friend just dropped us off and she looked for parking. My bf and I checked in and were told it was a 2.5 hour wait.  It was ok because we just headed to the bar and I had the tater tots.   I am quite obsessed with the tater tots.  You have to have the tater tots.  Anyway, although it was busy, the flow was fine.  We just went to the bar and had food and bevs. Also, the staff was ridiculously nice and accessible.  If you had a question, there was always someone around, whether the bar, the floor or the bay. Once we got a bay, they helped us get situated and bring out stuff to the bay.  Note: Topgolf on a Saturday night is more akin to a happening bar than a driving range-- people were in casual going out/bar-hopping clothes, compared to golf gear in Chicago.  Also, I think my friend who lives out there and I were the only ones who brought our own clubs.  No biggy.  I was there for the tots, beverages, and golf-- in that order.  It's Topgolf on a Saturday night.  It's more of a party.  Just letting you know this so that if you are a serious golfer and really want to practice your drive, you know what's up.  You can still practice, but don't get Type A-anal-retentive about the crowd.  Super fun place from novice to advanced golfers or people on dates or trying to get a date.",

It's like playing darts with a golf club. Each time I've been here (whether it's 1pm or 6pm) it's been relatively packed, wait time can range from 5minutes to an hour and a half. The good thing is that there's a bar to kill time while you wait for your bay to open (they'll send you a text alert once your bays available). The food here is decent at best-stick with their sliders if you know what's best for you.",

Everything is reasonably priced.   We went in the evening when the lights were on which was fun. Shot off the second story.   Things to consider: - Didn't know you have to have a lifetime membership first before reserving a tee. It's just $5, and I recommend doing it online before you get there.  - With 6 people, one game lasted us about an hour. So figure out a good pace for playing.",

Another 30 minutes later we are still waiting! Had to talk to a supervisor and he didn't look into why we were waiting so long and didn't even offer an apology. Ended up waiting a total of an hour and 45 minutes and just decided to leave. There were countless bays open the whole time. We will not be back",

The precious time I came we waited approx. 15 minutes for an attendant to help with the system. We also met our waiter and were served some time later but the orders were incomplete.  This was about three months ago and not much has changed.  We arrived on a Friday and were okay with waiting for a \"lane\" for about an hour. We enjoyed drinks and the ambiance and decided to order. When our lane was ready we asked the waiter when our food would be available and if we could transfer to the Bay Area downstairs. He kindly went to check.  No food order.  Instead of apologizing he said we must have orders from someone else. I explained that was False because I asked about a specific dish and he said it was spicy. He asked if that was okay. Instead of admitting his error he simply said, \"there is no food for you.\" Instead of offering a suggestion to fix the error we were left trying to figure it out.   Going to the Bay was a bit better... Once we found the waiter. She was great and apologized for the error. But we still waited for dinner for another hour.  Poor waitress left to clean it up.   I love the ambiance of this place, but please don't come here hungry. I am sorely disappointed in the service, especially when I was expecting and okay with spending some money on food and drinks.",

Because of this, I figured that planning a small business meeting here would be a good idea.  However, I didn't know that dealing with TopGolf is filled with more red tape and needless rules than the IRS combined with the DMV.  I just spent 2 weeks trying to arrange a small meeting where I would give TopGolf over $700.  Below is what I wanted on Saturday, November 14th.  All hourly rates are on their website or were listed on the event planning PDFs they sent me.   * Conference room from 9am to 3pm @ $40/hr ($240 total) * Hitting Bay from 3pm to 5pm and 5pm to 8pm @ $35 and $45/hr, respectively ($205 total) * Food/beverage minimum of $300 that could be applied both in the conference room and hitting bay (for some reason, a food/beverage minimum is required to get the conference room)  They turned my offer down and said they were already making too many concessions in their previous proposal.  Bummer.  Anyway, everybody I talked to was very friendly and eager to help in the typical corporate fashion.  You know....pretending to give a darn, but really just wanting to move on to a person/company with deeper pockets.",

I finally asked someone where we should place our food and drink order and was told there is a private you shouldn't be down here after I was just told to go downstairs Then a waitress shows up and says for sure we can take your order we have two hours before the private party. Place our order then another person manager with attitude comes over and says we can't be down here. Ok grab us a table upstairs help the customer out and she says no you just need to go find a table on the main level or the terrace level 3. Nice!!

There are plenty of ways to score points, and plenty of games for people to play, so everyone ends up having a great time!  On top of that, the food is amazing. We had both the Mango Habanero wings and Buffalo Chix flatbread - both were excellent. Tables around us were also happy with their food.  Note: GET THERE EARLY.

What a creative idea and I bet they make millions.   This is definitely not your average driving range. It is two stories and is a bar. Each section is like a VIP area with couches, table and your own section to golf.   I've never been to a place like this, only seen it on tv and I am highly impressed!   First, the service was great and attentive. We received everything fast without any issues. I was drinking and not eating but my group ordered various things from burger to salad and everyone was satisfied.   The range overlooks a beautiful view of the Talking Stick casino. The computer calculates how well you do so you can play for fun or actually compete. You have to pay to play. I believe $30 or more. I wasn't playing much but I hit a few times and not bad for a newby.  Overall this is a great fun spot that also has music and it's a great place to hang out with your friends! I can't wait to go back!",

Our waitress never returned so we ended up going to the bar to order a drink. Then the continued immaturity from the staff was ridiculous. Staff were chasing each other around the bathrooms/restaurant area flirting constantly. Then towards the end when we were leaving, they were goofing around behind the bar that ended up in a glass being broken. Did they handle that professionally? Nope. They started creating more of a scene than was necessary at all. One of the younger guys was d*cking around with the bartender very loudly saying, \"what the f*ck did you do that for, it's all your fault!\" In a joking and completely unprofessional way. All customers were looking at them by this time and instead of apologize for the interruption they continued to goof around and curse behind the bar. For the $50 an hour that they charge to golf, I'm shocked that there was no management or maturity among the staff. Extremely disappointing.",

    "text": "Really wanted to like this place.  I'll probably do this twice a year and do a guys night.  Like someone mentioned, one ball at a time, takes time for the points to register, the hour can go quick.  The matts you hit off are pretty worn down and hard to hit off of.  The way the points are calculated is always a guessing game, it's really inaccurate.  You can basically find one hole and fixate on that one the entire time if you want to win.  I'd recommend doing 5 balls at each hole and turn it into a competition.    The layout of this place is a C grade, it can get really congested.  Lines go out the door, if you want to get to the bar or to the tee boxes, you have to worm your way through.  It's confusing about what line to get into even though there's people to help out.  The bar is great, though it should have been more detached from the entrance IMO.  Drinks are very expensive, mixed drinks are tiny.    Our host was awesome though, Brock.  We came in a party so our 3 lanes were reserved, he was very pleasant.  I hope when I go back it's a guys night and it's more enjoyable.",

We waited in line to become life time members at $5 each (membership is required), then waited in another line at the concierge's desk. We were told it would be 45 minutes to get to our spot. Since we would not be able to begin our fun, it would be after the 12:00 cut off for the price increase from $25 to $35. Whatever. So we decide to wait in the game and TV room. The waiter, Dan, came and took our drink orders. He brought them about 10 minutes later and we ordered appetizers and one of us ordered ice cream. Plus, 3 waters were ordered. Nothing ever came. About 35 minutes later we asked Dan where everything was. He said he'd check, and we also asked for the water. Another 20 or so minutes went by, and our group was called to report to our spot. Suddenly, Dan was there!! He wanted to make sure we got our food and said it would be delivered to us. At this point none of us even cared about our food. Within minutes, the food appeared, like magic!! I asked him again, for the 3rd time, for water. About 10 minutes later, the water arrived, along with 2 beers which had been ordered. So to sum up, when you get there, bring your own food and drink because by the time you get it it will be time to leave. I did see a sign in the ladies room they are having a hiring event on March 22. Maybe they don't have enough employees right now. I'm certain they don't have enough cooks, and they definitely had poor customer service today! Anyway, the golf part was fun but we were on the very bottom floor. One of the people I was with said it's more fun to be on the floors above. You'd certainly get a better view. I liked the TVs since it was the first day of March Madness. This location is crazy busy. I have heard the Gilbert location is not as busy. I doubt I will go back to this location. I think i will just go to a driving range at a local golf course and hit balls. I don't need all the glamour and Scottsdale fanciness this place has.",

Second off its mid summer and over 90 degrees outside and it took over 20 min to get a pitcher of water and then another 15 for them to bring out glasses to go with the pitcher. Our waitress was gone the whole time.. The worst part is that all the employees were sitting around chatting while we were waiting. COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL AND HORRIBLE SERVICE!",

Service here was on point and they were all very helpful in explaining the rules and the best approach to play the game. Really love the view of the Indian Casino with all the lights, and we even managed to see the dry Thunderstorm without the rain. What  a great time, and I highly recommend coming here after work, or simply to spend time with friends and family.  Until then, Cheers! ~ :p",

In short, I'm disappointed with the service. The facility is cool and the food is actually really good. We reserved online and noted birthday as the occasion and asked for left-handed clubs. My mom wanted to bring a cake, but we were unable to reach anyone at the location (on hold 20 minutes and gave up). When we got there they said no. I told them it was my birthday and not only could I not bring in my cake, they didn't provide any dessert which was pretty weird to me. Also, we request left-handed clubs three times before we received them. Workers not very attentive, so don't expect anyone to go the extra mile for your special occasions.",

It's a little on the expensive side, especially if you order food and drinks...expect to spend at least $70-$100. If you're coming to play just one round of golf with a few people, it's relatively inexpensive but who can come here and not drink? It makes it all the more fun, especially when the servers come right to your bay. haha.   The golf bays are really comfortable complete with patio couches and tables and heaters in the winter. I recommend getting a bay on the third level if possible...the view is better.",

Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. We ordered the nachos which looked like they had been thrown together and sat under the heat lamp for too long. Our flatbread was nothing to write home about. The pork sliders were great and the pretzel bites were average. The margaritas we ordered were extremely weak and not worth the money.   Zachary guided us to our bay and gave us directions. He actually made a sarcastic remark that wasn't appreciated.   We each had 2-3 balls that didn't register a score despite being hit somewhere into the targets. We had a few balls bounce out, but at least 9 that didn't and the score didn't get counted. For those of us who are horrible at golf, every point counts. We mentioned this to our server who explained it away as the sensor on some of the balls not working. It was disappointing to pay $35/hr for balls that didn't work correctly.   We don't live in the area, but if we did we would not return to this location and instead would go to the Chandler Top Golf.",

I've come here twice in the last month- once with a group of co-workers for a team building activity and once on a date.  The food on both of my visits was unfortunately not great though.   The first time I came I ordered the shrimp cocktail and it was honestly disgusting. The shrimp itself was fine but seasoned with (I think) paprika which wasn't a good combination IMO. I choked it down but not enthusiastically. It was served on wonton crisp-like chips with uncooked onion, jalapeno pepper and funky tasting cocktail sauce. I did not enjoy it AT ALL. I dumped all the toppings off and ate the chips by themselves and only because I was starving.  The second time I ordered a quesadilla and it was also noooo bueno. The cheese wasn't fully melted and tasted kind of like a kraft single melted between two tortillas. The peppers on the quesadilla were cold and uncooked.  The guacamole served with the quesadilla was bland and mediocre.  The only thing I enjoyed was the cookie & marshmallow fluff dessert my date and I ordered. It was yummy.  The price for an hour of golf varies depending on what time you come. In the morning it's $25, from 12-5 is $35, and after 5 it's $45 per hour. I came after 5pm both times I visited Topgolf. For a group of five coworkers, $45 is a bargain. BUT for an intimate date with two people, it's a pretty steep price to pay. I think on future visits I will eat before I come and only get drinks & dessert here and I'll likely come in the afternoon rather than the evening.  One thing I have to give them credit for is that they make a major effort to keep you cool in the summer heat. They have numerous huge fans (with misters attached)  blasting every which-way and you definitely will NOT get hot here. Love that!",

    "text": "Fun in the sun, as others may put it! Topgolf is really a kid-friendly recreational arena that combines bowling/golfing fun for the entire family (for a modest fee, of course). Food and drinks are also on the higher end of the general price spectrum, so don't be too alarmed if your wallet ends up feeling considerably lighter by the end of the day.  The golfing bays themselves are well-kept, and you'll be regularly/frequently attended to by the staff members, which can be good or bad, depending on whether you order food and drinks or not... Otherwise, it might just seem a bit awkward, if all you wanted is ice water, and the server asks you numerous times throughout the hour if there is anything else that you may want to order. This was also the case when I was just playing billiards with my coworker on a random, rather empty, weekday afternoon after work (thus, we were dressed in clinical scrubs). We were asked by 2-3 different servers if we were there to play golf as well and/or if we wanted to order food/drinks. At the end, we just succumbed to the pressure and ordered a beer and a hamburger + fries (which weren't anything special in and of themselves, but did cost us a pretty penny). All in all though, our billiards games were fun, despite the occasional interruption by the servers and the side glances at the only two people playing pool in the recreational room.  Suffice to say, Tolgolf can be a fun place to play some pseudo-golf (when it isn't too packed), but I doubt it's a place that serious golfers will frequent, due to its steep prices for a golfing bay, food, and drinks.",

    "text": "It is a place to be young, old, good at golf...or not, for family outings, for couples or friends, and even for business functions...its all great.  Objective is to hit balls into circles at varying distances on the range and get points which are calculated by the computer. This is not like real golf where the ball must be airbourne. Aim & hit... \"It's in the hole!\"  \"Tiger Woods.\" Minus of course the affair. I must have uttered these words a few times during our visit to Topgolf in Scottsdale.  The facility has so many bays on three levels, you loose count.  They have two types of bays. High tops to sit out and others have an L shape sofa type seating. Second and third floor have the best views. Awesome sight especially at night. All the neon lights are up out on the field. The twinkle lights of The Talking Stick Resort & Casino adds to the ambiance as well. Cost depends on the time of day you go. $25 per hour (per pod or bay not per person) before noon. $35 before 5pm & $45 after 5pm. Each bay can holds 6 and can play for this price. Clubs are included both for men & women or you can bring your own. Purchase a granted lifetime membership for $5 to keep your score, progress and is valid across the country.   For those in the party mood, this is also a great place to chill and have some drinks and food. There is also a billiards area, shuffleboard tables, restaurants on each tier & bars. Loads of fun!  Also have rooms for private parties.    Not quite ready to end the night?  How about going over to the Talking Stick Resort Casino just down the way.    Such a welcoming escape from reality and a fun way to pass the time. Overall, I would definitely return again when in town. Also looking forward to check out their other locations across the country too.  Good service, very clean & well-maintained with friendly employees.  The golf itself is fun.  \"Just tap it in. Just tap it in. Give it a little tappy. Tap Tap Taparoo.\" --Happy Gilmore",

They do have a full bar, so the options are endless and great for accommodating even the pickiest of drinkers.  I highly recommend making reservations ahead of time as it gets packed, even midweek. The process is simple: go online, find the date/time you want, pay a small fee and voila, you're done. Know, you can't book more than seven days out, so if you're a planner, that might deter you a little bit.  Everything is electronic and your server will walk you through the steps if it's your first time. Once you're setup, you aim towards your target and try to rack up as many points as possible. I don't think any of us were really there to compete as we just kinda took turns hitting things and seeing how far we could make them go. Definitely made for some great boomerangs.  It's a great group activity and I'd definitely do it again if in the area and looking for something to do.",

The food is pretty good and the alcoholic beverages will make you feel like you are the king when you hit one of the targets!   This place \"normalizes\" the golf game, because if you whack in the general direction you will be able to get something, and it's always fun when you got something in golf. Clubs are complimentary; Upgrade to Tyalors for 15 bucks.   The only thing is that they rent by stalls and time and it can be pretty expensive if it's less than a threesome going. An hour is 45 bucks and if new member additionally 5 bucks each person. But overall, very good experience and I am already planning on motivating the horde! We shall drink! Eat! Golf!",

So I don't know how individual activities are.  We had a very good golf instructor who walked us through how to use their system.  He always worked with several people on their swing and how to improve.    I believe we had the FAJITA FIESTA buffet.  Steak and chicken fajitas with peppers + cilantro savory rice + chipotle-braised  black beans + tortillas + chips and salsa and guacamole (extra cost) + shredded cheese + pico de gallo + sour cream + chocolate chip cookie bites.  We also did the INJECTABLE DONUT HOLES - cinnamon-sugar dusted donut holes + chocolate and raspberry filling.  Everything was really tasty.  Loved the chips and guacamole.  Fajitas were really tasty.  Loved the donut holes.    Our waitress had a big task on her had with our large group who like to drink.  She was pretty fast and was able to get us new drinks with ease.  She deserves a big tip.  Overall a fun place, even for those that don't golf.  Good food, good drinks, fun atmosphere.",

    "text": "This is a double review. I've been here for both a typical golf experience as a party of 6 and to have our son's 7th birthday there.  Party of 6: We reserved an early bay on the weekend, making it about $25/hour. We also bought food off the menu and the nachos are absolutely incredible. We also liked the wings, pretzel bites with the beer cheese, and veggie burger. We had a bay on the second floor and loved it. The misters were on (hot day). It could've been slightly cooler, but was still an awesome experience. We vowed to come back again soon.  Birthday Party: Our son loved our experience so much when we visited in a smaller group that he said he wanted to have his birthday party here. We booked online for a lunch party (12-2pm) for 12 kids for $300. It works out to $400 because of gratuity and fees, but in my opinion, it was a great deal. The golfing for a bunch of 7yo kids was more just hitting some balls, but it was perfect. We had a double couch setup, lunch was delivered (chicken strips, cheeseburger slider, fruit, tator tots and unlimited drinks) to each kid. The portions were awesome. We only had 10 kids, but they still have us the 12 meals. We were allowed to order more items, too (not included). The kids loved lemonade and our amazing server brought pitchers and cups. They have a gift table, cake table, water station, the works. It was held on the bottom level (safer) and this time, they turned on the heaters for us making it perfect. Our server was the best, the event coordinator visited our area a few times to check in and make sure all was well, the overall coordinator checked in via phone/voicemail with me multiple times and they even had our server waiting at the entrance when we walked in with a framed sign that said my son's name. Made him feel so special. When our time was up, we still had a couple kids waiting for their parents so we went to their outdoor area and the kids played bags/cornhole and enjoyed their goodie bags (not included).  It was super awesome and we would do it again!",

Me and my wife ordered boneless chicken wings and flavor that we have selected was Asian sesame and we also ordered peach ice tea.

I can't figure out their amazing technology which makes learning to golf so accessible and mastering so fun. This is the bowling alley of golf, but much higher class. I think their secret to success must be in the fabulous variety of food because golfing there is so inexpensive -- $25 an hour for 1-6 people. They offer table service of drinks, breakfast, brunch, lunch, and snacks. I saw advertisements for great happy hour deals too. To be honest, I'm not a big sports or bar person, and I really had fun at Topgolf. I'll be back!",

There is a console for you to play an organized game or you can do what we did and just hit balls for the sake of hitting balls for your time on the green.  Also, their snacks are delicious. We had the pretzel bites, some queso concoction (chips were from bag, but the queso more than made up for them), nachos, and fries.

We had been trying to go for a couple weeks and realized that the best way to ensure a bay is to reserve one online. Even weeknights are very busy especially at this location! We stayed for about two hours and the service was great. Everything is done digitally and the waiters/waitresses are very helpful if you are having issues. In addition, they are able to split the cost of the bay between the people present, which I thought was very handy! The food is pretty good and decently priced and they have a large selection of beers and a full bar. I was so excited to order the injectable donut holes and they did not disappoint. If you do order them, I would definitely suggest getting raspberry jam as one of your fillings because that was by far my favorite. I also enjoyed the chocolate (but did not try the Bavarian cream).",

    "text": "It may have taken me awhile to make my way to Topgolf, but now that I've been, I hope to return again sooner than later!  My group of approximately 20 lucked out and scored a couple of bays next to each other on a recent Thursday night... it was the perfect place for \"happy hour\" and to literally unwind after a couple of days of in-office meetings.    We enjoyed some drinks and appetizers and chit-chatted while taking turns teeing off. It was fun to see how skilled some of my colleagues are at golf (and also to laugh with those that are not so skilled too...me being one of those)!  The staff at the bar and working the bays were all friendly and attentive, and the facility is huge with a super fun vibe.  There is fun music playing but it's not too loud to where you can't have a conversation.  There is comfortable seating for those hanging, watching, waiting for their turn to tee off too.  In addition to the area we were hanging in, this venue offers a bar, retail area, billiards area, shuffleboard, multiple restaurants, a rooftop terrace with a fire pit, over 200 HDTVs, private event spaces and meeting rooms, and free Wi-Fi too.  The Topgolf concept has really seemed to take off, and I can see why.  I look forward to returning for date nights, family playdates, parties and more.",

I spend countless hours here while I'm on a business trip and the service is amazing the facility is amazing and they have a onsite director of instruction who gives lessons. His name is Jesse Hughes and he told me that he gives lessons and I told him I was flying out soon but thank you. He offered to look at my swing (I was struggling lol) Then gave me a a short lesson no questions asked no offer of services. Fixed my swing in minutes. If this guy does this for you Tip him! His lessons are $115.00 an hour and will come back to visit him next time. Fun weekend thank you Top Golf and thank you Jesse!",

That is the least of my concerns at a place I've loved for a long time. I need to make a very accurate comment about this place; the service is absolutely horrible! On more than 5-10 occasions I have come and sat at the ground level bar, new downstairs patio, or rooftop and it takes multiple people to recognize we have sat down and sometimes up to 15 -20 minutes to even be acknowledged or be served. I cannot lie or exaggerate about the timeframe! Trust me, I wish I was exaggerating. I first brushed it off because this was such a great place to come to but something needs to be brought to attention. I understand when the place is fully booked and events pack up the place and I have been courteous to timeframe of service in those circumstances. The problem I believe lies in the people you hire. You can't have 6 people behind a bar regardless if you are a bar back or not and not be acknowledged customers for long periods of time. The training just needs to be better at the very least greet people and say \"I'll be with you in a minute\" instead of no eye contact or acknowledgment. I hope management or someone can see that from a loyal customer who has come here since the opening, please fix or find a way to better train your employees. The sad truth is I've mentioned this to the last few people who have come to this location with me and they finish my sentence agreeing, I'm just the one finally making it evident to bring it to your attention. I love you top golf. Work on your service for the love of everyone!",

What a brilliant concept - turning a driving range into a full entertainment, food and drinks venue.  It's a little pricey, but not terribly. First time I went was on a Thursday night and the place was totally packed. There are 3 levels of bays and the top (3rd) always seems to be occupied by a large corporate group - which this place is ideal for. We waited awhile, had some drinks & food, then got a bay on level 2 (the higher up you are, the better).  Golfers or non-golfers will both have fun as they've created scoring games with multiple targets, and many levels of them. Bring your own clubs or use the house clubs, it's your preference. Even if you've never picked up a club, you'll have a ton of fun at this place.",

I'm usually shy away from golf-related activities because I'm too competitive to accept the fact that I'm not good at this sport.  We were on the first floor, which was perfect - we could easily see where our balls were falling.  I also liked that there was a computer at each station that projected images of exactly how far you hit.  There were people on both sides of us but I never felt like we were too crammed.  I was surprised to see the variety of clubs provided...not that I know the difference but I'm sure someone does and would appreciate having options.   The entire place was very clean and orderly (even the bathroom).   The outdoor misters were perfect for beating the heat.  The waitresses were attentive.  We shared pizza and the mini waffles with chicken - both were tasty.  I wasn't expecting a lot since we weren't going there for the culinary experience.  I was pleasantly surprised.  If you're not into golfing, there were some indoor activities (pool, arcades games, etc.) to keep everyone busy.  I loved the memories made at Top Golf.  My friends and I shared so many laughs (mostly at my expense because I was so bad).  It's a fun activity that all ages will enjoy.",

Went back a half an hour later to get told that the kitchen is now closed. I was pretty understanding, so I went ahead and asked for a beer instead. \"Bar closes at 11:30.\" This is what I get in response, once again I'm understanding coming from customer service. Then I check my phone to see if my girlfriend had asked for anything and it was 11:20. So not only did the incompetent piece of Shit not get me my appetizer, the bar tender wouldnt take 10 seconds to pour me a beer. To top the entire night off, I was told I would pay 45 dollars and I could play till close. Ended up getting charged 90$, didn't get an appetizer I had ordered, couldn't get a beer cuz the bar closed in 2 minutes. Overall I will not be returning to this location, the customer service here is an absolute joke. If you want your money's worth, head to Gilbert. Unless all you wanna do is smack some golf balls.",

We played from the bottom floor which basically meant we couldn't aim for anything other than the three holes directly in front of us. For the amount you pay to play here to basically hit a wedge, 8, or 6 iron, I'm sorry this fucking blew. We had planned on coming tomorrow too but not anymore. We'll take our 300+ dollars of business to the casino instead, since the few people who are that awful at hitting a driver ruined it for everyone else.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love Topgolf?! It is pretty much a bowling alley in golf form. When they first opened, they had up to 3 hour wait times on the weekend evenings. I'm not sure if it has improved over time and with Topgolf Gilbert opening. However, coming in on weeknights are lovely! No wait! If your birthday falls on a Monday or Tuesday, don't hesitate to plan a little get together here with your clique. The price at night is reasonable -- $45/hour per bay for up to 6 people. I hear it is even cheaper during the day. The more the merrier and the more affordable it is per person. If you are hungry, I suggest the wings, you can't go wrong! The Asian zing sauce is tasty. I wish they had better options for dessert because that's my thing. The donut holes are pretty good. I heard they took out some desserts they used to serve that sounded better than what they currently have, whats up with that?! But back to what this place is really about -- golf. This is a driving range on steroids and it is so fun, even for the non-golfer, cant-hit-the-ball but who cares! It's all in good fun in the name of friendly competition. And the amazing attitude on the staff is infectious! I have only encountered super fun, energetic, attentive concierge and servers here. Thanks for the good times, Topgolf.",

Though he was very friendly and seemed interested in resolving the issue, no options were offered (Like when Donald Trump speaks about Condoleezza Rice).  On quite a few occasions he mentioned that he was new to the issue and was not abreast of all the facts.  This is customer service in America today, \"I understand you are unhappy but there is nothing I will do about it but invite you back for another dose of what I hope is better the next time.\"  The only way I would go into anything unprepared is if I was willing to concede or if I knew I had no intention of changing my position regardless of the truth.

    "text": "I love it here with grown ups or with kids. You have to be prepared going in, there could be long waits and it gets more expensive at night, but it's so much cooler all lit up. You can have 6 golfers per bay and it's not easy to get two bays together, so if you have a bigger group than 6, it might put a damper on things if it's busy and you have to be separated. But, if you're six or less (golfers, you can have more people just hanging out), it's really fun. Last time we went, we got there around 4 on a Saturday and it was a two hour wait. So I logged on and bought a priority pass and we got right in. That's how I would recommend doing it, get there, see how long the wait is and if it's super long THEN get the priority pass. For example, if you get there and it's only 45 minutes, to me that's not worth the $50. They have a bar, so you can hang out there and get drinks, the wait goes by pretty quick, especially with all the activity around you in the bar area. The food is a huge step up from Dave and Busters (our other go to with the kids). We did the mushi (like southwest \"sushi\" rolls), some salads (decent), and the kids love the chicken strips. The tots are good but, I mean, they're tots so I don't really get the review I read raving about them. They have these avocado eggrolls that are bomb. Get those for sure. Oh, and your golf experience doesn't matter, all levels will have fun.",

We started off in the bar for brunch.  The food at TopGolf was amazing!  I had the Crab Cake Benedict with house potatoes.  Very delicious and full of flavor.  Thank you for the right amount of Hollandaise sauce.  Granted, we had 11 people in our group but the service was not great.  Most of the party had ordered at the same time with one latecomer.  The Bartender tried her best to come back and refill our drinks but the bar got busy.  We had a couple orders that had to be sent back and those orders took another 40 minutes to have corrected.  One of the orders only requested toast.  We tried to talk to the Manager about the lack of service and the missing orders, but he gave us attitude.  He didn't try to fix the situation and we had to wait for the missing food.  I recommend if you are going to have a bar with a restaurant, you need to have the staff to handle morning brunch.  The Bartenders cannot wait tables and handle the drink order rush.    Once outside, we were treated to a wonderful golf experience.  You will have purchase a $5 dollar golf license and this never expires.  On the bay you can play by the hour : $25 per hour open until Noon, $35 per hour Noon-5 and $45 per hour 5:00 until close.  Once everyone has swiped their card into the computer, you can play.  We had the best server on the bay.  Our server constantly came by to make sure that we had drinks and he even helped us with some group photos.  I can't remember his name but he was awesome!  TopGolf is definitely an experience.  I am not a golfer but I would come back for another round.  I like the setup of the bays and the various golf clubs they have for men and women.    For being an outside venue, it was the best chilled place in a 100 degree weather.  If you have your own clubs, bring them.  But leave the drivers at home.",

If your not at all concerned about identify theft this is the place for you as to comply with their \"registration\" you must give them your drivers license so they can scan it, your e-mail address and cell phone number.  To begin with they have more rules about what you can/can't bring than the TSA does about getting on a plane. No woods/drivers because they didn't design the course correctly. You can't bring your own irons in, if you do you are limited to the bottom level (I thought this was top golf, not bottom golf?). We found this out simply trying to bring my 9 iron in and my Son's youth 7 iron. What is my iron going to do that their crappy clubs won't? If your a golfer how do you get better using anothers crappy club?  Upon entering I asked how long the wait was and the guy at the door said 45 minutes. Then after waiting a few minutes to get through line and pay for the mandatory membership per person I inquired again about the wait and she said she didn't know you would have to ask concierge which was another area/desk. When I got to concierge to \"check in\" the wait was now 1 1/2 hours. Wow, now that they had my money the truth about the wait comes out and it's doubled. Well by now we are going to stick this one out. So we went to the bar area to order a late lunch. Wait staff was very disorganized as we had to wait nearly 15 minutes before we could flag somebody down and get their attention for which they replied \"Oh, do you want to order something?\". Nah, we just figured we'd all sit at this table and stare at menu's for the next 90 minutes.  We finally got assigned a station and began having some fun, but the machine that dispenses balls broke down 3 separate times.   Great concept, poor execution and to me an invasion of privacy to comply with their registration process.",

Make sure you tell them if you're not ready to start your time or else valuable $$$ will be wasted! You get your own private bay with a tv and either high chairs or couches to accommodate your group. Food and drinks is a la carte so your night of posh driving range can add up really quickly. The games they offer are fun but I still don't know how it tracks my specific ball when I hit it in the range. Technology is amazing! Everything we ordered was delicious although they ran out of a lot of food. No chicken and waffles, no crab cakes and no calamari. Bummer since I wanted to try all 3! The sign says Purell is located everywhere but I didn't see any and considering I'm a germaphobe, I would suggest having one at every bay. Lastly, they are pet friendly! You're forced to be on the first floor unless you're a service dog and then you can be anywhere. Will definitely be back!",

Great place to hang with family or friends. Best choice for sharing are the flatbreads. The nachos are built as individual chips, so not ideal for sharing with more than 2 people like normal nachos.",

    "text": "Speaking as an avid golfer I know this review will not apply to everybody. I understand now that Tiger Woods is no longer relevant, and the golf industry is hurting and needs places like this to attract more people because it appeals to a broad audience. I got my grandfather a $25 gift certificate and it did not even cover one hour worth of driving balls! Be prepared to pay an extra five dollars per person for some kind of one time membership. You cannot hit woods, irons only, there was an old lady at the door making sure you did not bring them in the door. For a newly constructed multimillion dollar facility that appeals to golfers this is unacceptable! I was expecting for $25 an hour for all of our shots yardage to be tracked this is not the case. You have to hit the ball in the target for it to tell you how far  you hit it. Lame! from what I saw $25 an hour was the cheapest rate that you could play that is during the day I think it almost doubles at night. Some of the golf balls were so beat up I'm sure they did not fly as far as they should have which is unacceptable for what you are paying! I can go to PGA superstore to hit golf balls there for as long as I want and it tracks the yardage on every shot hit for free! But I guess if you're going there as a social occasion with friends then it's not a bad place to hang out, did not try the food or drinks so I cannot comment on that. I don't think that I will be returning here to practice, considering you can buy a bucket of balls at your local driving range for five dollars and have lunch and a beer on top of that and he still won't spend as much money. If they changed a few of these things and actually catered to actual golfers when they came in, it would be a pretty cool place.",

Will be going back for sure. Highly recommended even if you don't know how to golf or never really golf no matter how bad you think you may be you'll have a blast. **Note- you don't need to take golf clubs they will provide for you, lefty or righty they have both. If you take your own you can only take irons. Can't take your own drivers or hybrids, which was a little bummer but guess you have to keep playing field even I suppose.

Unfortunately, it is so packed that you will likely have to wait several hours to get a spot on the range and you will pay a pretty penny to do so after adding up all their miscellaneous fees, food, tax, and tip for a family of 4.

I have found it to be crowded in Friday's and Saturdays between 7-9. The wait can be anywhere from 30-90 minutes. There are 3 floors; I love being on the 3rd floor, it has the best view with the Talking Stick Resort in the background. There are multiple games you can choose from and it's a great way to have a little friendly competition.   The food here is really good and a lot to choose from. The crab cake and pulled pork sliders are my favorite. The best dessert which we always get is the injectable donuts. It comes with like 10-12 mini donuts and you can choose the chocolate, raspberry, or Bavarian cream to fill with. The drinks here also good and a variety to choose from.   The service here is good but it does get super busy so they do their best to be attentive but don't expect fast service at those times.   Prices might seem a little high but it's worth it and it's being split amongst however many are playing since it's a rate per bay. Also if you extend time and choose not to play; they put the credit on your Topgolf card so you can use it next time.",

There's music playing in the background, food and drink service to your table, think of bowling alley style service. Best part is watch the people beat you to see how to hit better lol.

The drinks hit the popular list from an Old Fashioned and Moscow Mule to IPA and Bud Light. The menu is pretty chain-y with your typical burgers, wraps and salads. They do have a veggie burger but alas, it had egg. Whhhyyy, just go full vegan or don't bother.   As far as the golf itself, just to preface a little, I don't golf. I barely miniature golf and usually just recite Happy Gilmore the whole time. I may have done that a few times here. Okay, so, it's great for beginners! They have all the clubs you need for both righties and lefties (me) with the lit up stations to aim. If you're bold and aim for the back fence you get the big points! The views here are pretty amazing too. Seating is ample, comfy and accommodating with the outdoor heaters.   Overall, this place is pretty fun. Great location for group events. I just wish they would add JUST ONE vegan option.",

It was a beautiful day. There was a 30-45 minute wait which wasn't bad at all and we were able to pass the time by quickly playing some pool downstairs. I don't know if we really even waited 30 minutes for our bay. We got a bay on the 2nd level. 2nd/ 3rd level is key! We ordered a bucket of corona lites and I ordered a margarita. We also ordered chips and guac. I will post a picture of the guac and salsa dishes. The appetizer is called chips and guac but underneath it also says you get salsa with it. When they brought it out, it was the tiniest guac dish I've seen and the salsa dish was much larger. My margarita was awful it was probably 98% margarita mix that was super sweet. Also it didn't have salt on the rim (on the menu it shows with salt on the rim). We were disappointed with the appetizer and I was disappointed in the margarita too. We ordered a gluten friendly buffalo chicken flatbread which was really good so the redeemed them. As always the golf portion is great and fun. Couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day.",

First, you have to wait a half an hour to get a \"Top Golf\" card if you do not have one already (it costs $$$ too). Second, you have to wait more than an hour to get into a booth (or whatever they're called). Then, once you are finally in the booth, you have to pay basically minute by minute to stay, all the while there is a constant barrage of servers and managers pressuring you to buy more crappy drinks and bar-food. All the while you are just hitting balls into a big open space? Why not just go to a driving range...? Idk, I don't get it.  You've got to be ready to drop about $200 if you're going to go here. And believe me when I tell you they WILL kick your butt out the minute you stop paying for time. We stopped playing, and had barely gathered our things before a manager came and asked us to leave for the next group.   I understand why this place is popular. But if I'm going to spend an exorbitant amount of money on food and drinks, I'd rather go somewhere that serves excellent food and cocktails (that is not this place) without the constant pressure of wait and management staff.

Anticipate a minimum wait of an hour and half to two hours on a busy Friday or Saturday night though.   The only thing that they can definitely improve on is the food. All of the food is what you would consider \"bar food\". Very greasy and not that fresh. I can understand why people would like this type of food to go along with golfing and beer but I feel like they have a good opportunity to really step up their game with the food.",

    "text": "To recycle a joke from Pineapple Express (and remove the profanity), TopGolf is like if a driving range and a skeeball game had a kid, and then in a different part of the country a bowling alley and a Dave and Busters had a kid, and then THOSE kids grew up, met, and had a kid - BAM! - Topgolf! Time for another episode of Pros and Cons!  Pro: Options for everyone - there are difficult and easy golf games, all built around on the GPS tracked golf balls and large targets in the ground on the range grass and based on accuracy, distance, direction, etc.  They have clubs of all sizes ready to go, along with shuffleboard, pool, some TVs with sports or Xbox Kinects...  Con: Not that great for kids - a little dangerous if they're on the driving range deck - I can't remember if this one has minigolf (some TopGolfs do)  Pro: Servers take orders for food and drink and bring the food right to your station - pub and sports bar type options, plenty of adult beverages that can even come in pitchers, and super-American options like loaded nachos, Chicken and Waffle sandwiches, and injectable donuts.  Con: Had to go through a pretty extensive sign-up process for a guest pass - took 10-15 minutes - just seems like it's a marketing info grab and they could do without it.  Pro: One of the best times I've had, just a very creative combination of a number of awesome things  Con: Super big missed opportunity? When the cart zips around to collect the balls, all the computers should just say \"HIT THE CART!\" for a few minutes - everyone is thinking it already, and it seems like the GPS could track if you did it or not - just put a couple nets on the cart like sails on a pirate ship.  It would be an epic community event and would look super cool like a mix of \"NYPD! Hit the chopper\" from The Other Guys and the archers from the last battle in Braveheart.  Overall, stellar idea and decent execution",

    "text": "My husband loves golf. I don't. But this is a place that brought the two of us together and let us both play and have fun. :)   Before you go, you can reserve a bay at a certain time. Depending on the time and the location, you might have to pay a reservation fee. Seeing as how we went in the middle of a weekday in Scottsdale during the summer, we didn't have to pay a fee. Once you get there, check in is pretty painless. Each bay accommodates up to 8 people. You can bring your own clubs if you want, but you don't have to.   Once you're checked in, you just pick games and play for as long as you want to rent the bay for. We rented ours for two hours for 62 dollars. You also have to pay a 5 dollar membership fee if it's your first time there.   The servers were all really nice, and you can order food to be delivered to your table. The nachos and the chips and guacamole  was good. We didn't order too much food because it was a bazillion degrees outside and we weren't really that hungry.   Really fun place. Would come again, though probably not in the summer, lol. At one point it was 111 degrees, and the fans don't really do much. If you don't like being hot and sweaty, don't come during the summer.   You don't need to know how to play golf to have fun. It's kid friendly too...we saw plenty of kids there while we were there.",

Their servers seem relatively disinterested, when they're around, which isn't often.  Go for a great golf experience, but don't expect the food or the service to be any good.  The golf is great. Lots of different games to choose from, good clubs to choose from, and everything seems to work pretty well. While it is a little annoying the amount of advertisement they put up on the screen, the games on the screen work pretty well.  We really had fun doing the golf park. Especially when we requested the lounge chairs instead of the high top tables.  The food and service are poor. Maybe that should be expected, but for the price they charge, you would expect better service. Staff disappear for long periods of time, are slow to get food and drink orders out, and again don't seem focused at all on Customer Service.  Go, have fun, and have low expectations about anything not involved with golfing. :)",

My husband and one of my friends are avid golfers so this was heaven for them, I hit a couple balls but obviously did horribly.   I disliked the fact that the fans were blowing hot air, and the misters did nothing. The whole thing is basically outside, so with the 115 degree weather me and my friend who were watching the guys play were so uncomfortable. We were only offered water once, and got no refills even though we drank our water within 15 minutes of getting our glasses.   We ordered a pitcher of beer, which looked way smaller than other pitchers, and came out warm even with an ice block in the middle of the pitcher. We ended up still having fun but it was so hot out and it didn't feel like our waiter or the staff really did anything to make the players cool.",

The staff at this location were very consistent in attending to us, a bonus! A staff member even came around to share his expertise on golf and offered his assistance if we needed it. With a nearby bar and televisions all around us, it was a very social environment as we played with people who later joined our table due to space. We played through the sunset (which was awesome to watch in the distance during our games) and really enjoyed ourselves. While TopGolf can be a bit pricey, this location makes for a fun night out.",

It's a reservation fee, seems ridiculous that this does not go towards your bill. We set up for two hours of play which is $80, plus each player has to pay a $5 fee/you can choose a lifetime membership which is the same cost and then you only are required to pay this once. They have a good menu with lots of pick from. The drink menu also has many options. We had really great service and the heaters kept us warm as it was a cold/rainy day. We had fun but it's a expensive night out.",

The food and drinks are surprisingly good for a \"sports bar\" themed establishment and the service is always super prompt. Yes, it takes a little while to get everyone set up in the system but, other than that the experience was nothing but seamless.   Another highlight of Topgolf is the sheer number of flatscreens they have playing all kinds of sporting events. Seriously, this place is a gamblers heaven. Speaking of gambling...there's a casino in the distance called Talking Stick and you hit balls directly at it. Fitting ;)   I'll be back for sure!",

We are on vacation with family in Phoenix, looking for family fun and decided to try this out. What fun! They took our reservation online and we only waited 10 minutes when we arrived. Our time didn't start into we were ready (and adding time was no problem.) Their attendant walked us newbies through the process of getting logged into the system, how to be safe, and change games. Alcohol was served by wait staff (took a little bit, but they were clearly packed). The food was a little pricey, but not unexpected.  I'll try out their location in Las Vegas for sure!",

Then the concierge took us down to our bay, explained everything and made sure we knew not to \"Happy Gilmore\" it. We had a server, Zach, who was FANTASTIC. He kept our beers full and our stomachs happy. We had some jerky people come to the bay next to us, two guys who were super rude to him and he was just nice as ever. He suggested great food, we had the nachos and the bf had the chorizo and egg sliders and he loved them. The only reason this isnt a 5 is because I ordered the house salad with chicken and it was awful. The lettuce was wilted, the chicken was charred black, and it wasn't so great. But I LOVED the rest of the experience.",

(That resulted in me being really sore for like 3 days.) My boyfriend works in the golf biz and we'd been watching the construction on this place like hawks for months. So glad it's finally open and so close to where we live!  We went during their soft opening last night. I know the first few days of a business being open can come with dealing with kinks, but all staff/service/amenities were completely up to par (GOLF PUNS!) and beyond. We were never left wanting for anything. Our gal came around plenty of times for food orders, drinks, refills and was awesome. She was also really knowledgeable about what they didn't quite have available on the menu, since they aren't 100% fully open to the public yet. A great touch. (Also? The bathrooms were PRISTINE.)  The food was pleasantly and surprisingly great. I had the nachos, which consisted of individual tortilla chips covered in \"drunken beans\" and topped with multiple cheeses (yes, queso dip is involved) and green and red jalapenos with servings of guac and pico for dipping. It was completely delicious. Boyfriend ordered the \"mushi\" (think mexican pin-wheel/sushi remix) that he said was outstanding and way more filling than it looked. I had two glasses of delicious and surprisingly strong strawberry/mint sangria that set us back $5 apiece. WHAT?  So, onto the actual reason of Topgolf: Golf games! Like I said, I don't participate but boyfriend and guys we were with loved it. It seemed glorious. You can either bring your clubs or used the standard ones they provide (for both men and ladies!) and choose between different games, i.e., hitting 5 balls in a row into each massive lit-up target on the range, hitting 1 ball into each target, distance competitions, etc. Each bay is fitted with a TV that follows your score and tracks your balls.  An aside: The view is freaking ridiculous. Camelback behind you, Talking Stick in front of you (which is all lit up in dancing neon lights now--I'm guessing they realized they have to make it look sweet with all the people staring right at the place while they hit balls.) All in all, this is such a fun place, and different than anything else available in the area for an afternoon/night out. Will it become super crowded/overrun with drunks during spring training? Absolutely! Will we totally enjoy ourselves during all other times of the year? Yes!",

The OK:  Food was just OK, I can't help but relate it to being at the Brunswick Zone XL, it was good but not amazing.  The bad:  Price.  We were there for 2 hours with 3 people, we golfed and ate, it was $225.  I understand if we're on a nice N. Scottsdale course and we spend $100+ a pop for a round of golf and some drinks but to spend this much at a driving range just doesn't seem right.  I most closely relate this to high-class bowling and I can't see spending this much on a regular basis.  TIP:  Don't hit it too far, if you hit over the net they will know it was your ball that broke that car window.  This didn't happen to us but that is what they mentioned.  It seems impossible but a 250 yard high drive will do it.",

It was a slow process getting a players card.  There was only a few people in front of us when we got there and it took about 20 minutes to buy our $5 players card.  Then when we got to our station it took a while for us to get our drinks.  It did not seem overly busy and they seem to have plenty of staff so they could use some improvement here.    Food was not great, but wasn't really expecting that much.  Just your typical bar food.  Overall, I enjoyed myself and will come back.",

    "text": "Yesterday was my first time visiting this place (or even hitting a golf ball) and I already feel like a pro! $5 for a lifetime membership card that tracks your score, and depending on what time of the day you arrive, $25-45 per hour for a bay that can have up to 6 players. We got a bay with a couch which was REALLY nice. Everyone working there was friendly and helpful when showing us how to play. The balls have GPS inside that tracks where you hit them, and you get points based off of which target it goes into and where on the target. There are different \"games\" you can play but we only played the one the attendant set us up on. We ordered some cheese fries and they were delicious. The price of the food is a little higher than what you get, but its pretty understandable considering where you are. I'm stuck between being glad I don't live closer because I would sink my money into this place every weekend, and sad because I really wish I could enjoy it more often than I can. I wish Tucson had something like this, but we suck and only have bowling!",

The environment is always full of energy, and I've noticed that they periodically do themed events with staff. In my opinion, the cost of the individual bay is beyond reasonable, especially split up amongst a group. The drinks and food can add up though, which is probably to be expected. The music is always great. I haven't tried them yet, but I know they have other activities available, like Wii, pool tables, and a few others I cant recall. Definitely a good time, whether for a work outing, birthday event or even a nice first date!",

The wine list could use a few more options.   Once you get to your lane, there are tables where you can order drinks and food. I really likes the Nachos that's loaded with jalapenos chicken and black olives, MAC burger is a must. Their signature mushi roll I think it was called was mediocre, very dry.. Wouldn't recommend it.

I personally have to hit my 5 wood to get to the black target. The time after my wife brought her clubs and has only golfed three times and might hit a ball 100 yards. I had to put back 5 hybrids and 3 woods. More recently while waiting I noticed many people were not allowed to bring their own clubs in or bottles of water. I personally don't bring my clubs anymore. All these new rules are being put in because someone did something stupid while ruining the experience for the rest of us.  The front entryway is incredibly small and most people have no idea where to go when they get in there. The card desk and the bay reservation desk need to be together or automated like a movie theater to speed things up. If you go there any time after 5pm, you will be hard pressed to find a parking spot and have about a 2 hour wait unless you have a VIP card. Good luck! This place has plenty of potential but they surely aren't using it.",

I really did not know what to expect because I am not a golfer at all, and I pretty much hate mini golf (horrible experience as a child). But I was her guest and happy to do whatever... I was just happy being in Arizona, in warm weather, and with my family.   Prior to getting there, my aunt tried explaining what Topgolf was and I did not get it at all. She said it was bowling for golf at a range... still did not help. However, as soon as I got there it clicked and her explanation was really spot on (sorry aunt T, I thought you were crazy for a sec)! Topgolf is a 3 level outdoor golfing range with outside targets that scores your swings/balls (I apologize, I do not know the proper golf terminology yet). There is a screen (like bowling) you use to track your scores and compete. They have several different games, but we just played the rookie one since we were both new to the idea.  It was a blast and I am really glad I was open-minded and tried. It was a gorgeous day to golf with my aunt and enjoy some beers. Did I mention that have a full kitchen and bar?! Yea... it was pretty awesome. I could only imagine how fun this place would be at night with my friends....!",

I was casually playing a game with my group of 10 friends when we accidentally had more than 1 golf ball out at a time. She got in our personal area and took the balls and threw them over so we couldn't use them anymore. We had paid for our time and the use of the golf balls. It's absurd how a WAITRESS, not even a Top Golf employee, has the ability to do that. She was out of line and approached us with aggressive behavior.",

Getting started was fairly easy although having to pay $5 to get a players card was a bit steep. There was a gentlemen that directed us to a bay on the 2nd floor.  We played a variety of different mini games and each one posted interesting challenges for us to overcome. I also saw the games room downstairs and that looked like tons of fun as well.

    "text": "Well I've heard all the buzz about Topgolf for a while..finally had to see it for myself. Well I was impressed! Topgolf is like a high end bowling alley but for golf. Best way to describe it.   You can rent a lane for up to 6 players for 30-60 mins. Everything is based on a card that cost $5 to register. I'm not thrilled about paying $5 for a card and that's why I left out a star. That fee as well as the overall cost is quite high in my opinion but if you split it with your friends then it's really not too bad.   The overall layout of the facility is really cool. There are 3 levels of golf lanes. I really liked this location as the backdrop of the mountains and TSR is really amazing. Plus come during sunset and hopefully you can get a lane towards the end and watch an amazing AZ sunset from behind.   Topgolf provides basic clubs here, but for a better challenge and better practice if you are really into golf is to bring your own. Just make sure you don't bring any drivers, woods, or even hybrids. They explained that in the past people were hitting over the net. I didn't think it was possible but if you were in the top level and were a good golfer you probably could hit it over.   What makes Topgolf so fun are the mini games you and your friends can play. There is top score, or try for top shot which makes you try to hit the specific greens. The balls are tracked to your players card so you can get an accurate reading of your shots.   They also provide service to the lanes, and your own TV which you can change the channel. Full bar, a few craft beers, and full menu. I didn't try any of the food but it looked like typical bar food.   All in all I really enjoyed Toogolf. If you are a military vet or police/fire be sure to ask for the lifetime hero discount. 10% off. Also works if anyone in your party has it which is cool. I've already been to this location a few times as well as the Gilbert location.   I think Topgolf is super fun. It's also fun for the non golfer in your group as well as women. My wife doesn't golf, but loved coming here to swing some clubs. You don't need to be into golf to enjoy Topgolf. Go try it for yourself and see.",

My only suggestion for improvement would be the queue system as you have to wait in one line to get a card that you bring to the second line to put your name on the wait list. Not sure why the first line couldn't just also control the wait. All in all, a great time. Would definitely come back.",

However, we were half way through our food and our bay only had 5 minutes left and our server mentioned lengthening our time (we already did once) and we passed because we just wanted to finish our food and leave. We spent $100 at the bar and our bill was $270 at our table. This man, Richard, came out asking us to move to the \"free\" section mid bite. That was probably the most insulting thing he said as if we didn't just spend $370 before a tip. He kept going on and on about the \"policy\" etc. we would have understood if it was 8pm on a Friday or Saturday and it was packed with a wait but it was 10pm on a Tuesday and there were all free bays in sight. My family is in town visiting me and we were trying to enjoy each other's company. We are reasonable and if we planned on staying to \"party\" we surely would have moved. Our family owns restaurants in PA so we know customer service and understand occupying servers tables. Richard should have came over, said hello, thanked us for coming and made the bay idle long enough for us to finish our meal. He should have given her a table out of her section to make up for us staying there (which idk what there would have been to make up for.. a $55 tip..?) and just confirmed we weren't there to party. I have never experienced anything like this in my life and is a sure way to keep people away from Top Golf. Such a disappointment.",

I came here initially with a group of my coworkers to celebrate the end of the fiscal year and even though most of them are not golfers we had a good time. I then brought my family back and we had fun hitting balls off of the upper deck. Yes, its a little nerve wracking when your 12-year-old decides to look over the edge but everyone had a great time and my wife and kids really enjoyed it as well. You don't even need to bring your own clubs, although if you're competitive you'll probably want to do so. Also, the food and drinks are good and no more expensive than any other night spot in Scottsdale.",

We went down the street to eat and as we pulled back in the parking lot I got the txt saying our bay was ready. As soon as we got to the concierge desk we got checked in and taken to the bay. They explained how everything worked and the waiter was there right away to get our order. We started off with just an hr of golf but added an extra 30 min since we where having such a good time.

The manner in which she explained our options to pay for the $52 hour and a half were not very clear (apparently you can't just pay the $52 at the bay, you can only pay in assigned increments... so we would have had to pay $60 and then had an $8 credit on our club cards?). It was very confusing and the employee did not understand why we were struggling with the concept. There turned out to be an easy solution, but we had to pretty much drag it out of the person explaining the process to us.  Our server was super slow with waters and drinks. He seemed annoyed we only wanted the one pitcher of beer. When the ball dispenser broke he was in no hurry to find someone from maintenance to help fix it. When we walked out by him he didn't smile, wave, or even acknowledge us.  Our ball dispenser broke twice and we had to wait for maintenance to fix it both times. One time they did credit us with an additional 15 minutes.  Multiple times there were balls that hit targets but no points were registered. These were not identified as practice balls so they should have been working properly.  I have never had ANY of these sorts of issues with my other Top Golf visits (this and the Gilbert location) so I am not sure what was going on but we were not impressed.",

Alex came over set everything up for us, was very patient, friendly and was always around when we need him.

    "text": "Update...This has very quickly gone downhill :(  It's such a great concept and was SO much fun at first but my last few visits have been extremely disappointing. I'll use my last visit to illustrate:  I finally got a chance to bring my dad to Top Golf. I already knew we weren't permitted to use drivers, woods, or hybrids (ridiculous) but we showed up at about 11:15am this day only to be told that as of THAT day, we can only hit our clubs from the first floor. This was a huge let down for me, especially since I had brought my new clubs with me. My dad goes with the flow so he said don't worry about it, the first floor is fine - because of course I wanted to play with my new clubs. So we were sent all the way to the end of the first floor (bay 103 to be exact) where the computers were broken, everything was dusty and dirty, and we got no service. Literally 25 minutes later we still hadn't even sat down, nor could we even get water because there wasn't a server in sight. Thirty minutes later, luckily we finally had a server and the computers were fixed because we had two other people that met us there about 11:45 to play. Our server was overly apologetic and awkward but at least the food was good.  It would have been nice if they had just offered to move us to a different bay? Not sure why they couldn't manage to do that.   I really wish they would come up with some kind of system where everyone has the opportunity to play with their FULL set of clubs and if you hit it over the fence once, that's it - you're out. I understand life isn't fair and they are \"fixing the fence\" or whatever but it would be so much more fun if we could use all of our clubs, on all of the levels, especially the girls! My boyfriend and I were planning on doing the Monday night tournament together but after this last visit we definitely changed our minds.  If I come back, it will probably only be for the nachos.",

Who wouldn't want to go?   Nevertheless, the staff was trained poorly. We were told it would be an hour wait (which was fine since it was a busy night). In the meantime we thought to grab a bite to eat and some drinks. We go to the bar upstairs, as directed, and were not acknowledged once by the bartender. I gave the benefit of the doubt being that it was a busy night. We go downstairs and before sitting, I ask the bartender if it's okay to order food at the bar as well. She gladly agreed. After 15 or so she comes to take our order but claims she is only taking our drinks order at this time. I politely decline as I stated originally that I'm here to order some food. She didn't seem too happy but it could've been due to the fact that the bar got busy in a matter of minutes.   Now it's time for us to go to our bay. I ask the guy at concierge for clubs because I am left handed and they don't normally have left handed clubs out. He provides a smart a** comment saying \"have you really been here before?\" Ummm yes I have but again I'm left handed so I need some clubs suitable for me .. He didn't realize that's why I asked and seemed embarrassed after   Finally it's time to golf! Our waitress upstairs was soo friendly. However they forgot to add the shots in our drink order. They brought over shots to stir in our drinks but She wasn't sure which shot had which so she  proceeded to smell the glass. A nose in a drink is not what i would prefer for a cocktail. I can't stress enough .. Top golf can be a great place for a fun night but I highly recommend more training for staff",

Or at least that is what it tasted like. The nachos were ok but honestly Taco Bell has better and it won't set you back 50 bucks.",

We show up and there is literally no parking, we had to park on the street and walk up the hill to get there. My husband brought his own clubs, 2 irons and a driver to use. As we walk up, a rude employee stops to tell us that we cannot use any drivers tonight because \"to many cars were getting hit in the casino parking lot\". Then she proceeded to tell is we will have to walk back to our car to drop off the driver my husband had, apparently Not trusting him to have it in his possession. On top of that we would have to wait an hour! Sorry. We're not okay with spending $45.00 for poor service, long wait and going to a range to hit irons. It's called a DRIVING range for a reason. So disappointing and now I'm stuck with a gift card were not even looking forward to using.",

The only thing missing from that \"At home feeling\" for her would be whatever god awful tv series she binge watches at the moment.",

    "text": "What a luxury. It's like the concept of bowling mixed with the driving range. You're offered drinks and food through table service while you hit balls or sit with your buddies covered in the cool shade outside. Even the golf balls roll back up to you like bowling balls do at the alley. There's a scoreboard that tracks how far you've hit each ball if you manage to sink your ball into one of the colored targets in the green. Very fun and very cool. It was only $25/ hour and a bucket of bud light bottles was about $25 as well. Clubs are provided. Staff were attentive and friendly. I was worried about showing up in flip flops but it didn't matter at all. Didn't happen to try any of the food. One negative: The netting is an absolute eyesore to the desert landscape, but I guess you can't really escape that if you want to experience this unique driving range. Overall, a very fun and novel outdoor experience.",

More importantly, when you try to extend the time, you have to add \"credits\" to your account and can only do so in certain increments. An hour and a half is $52 but you can't add that amount (have to add $75)! Bathrooms have only one towel dispenser and waste baskets are consistently overflowing. Food takes a long time to arrive and is luke warm. No 5 irons The \"nachos\" are basically a pizza  Pros: Fun time for groups! $3 tots are good and good value Reasonable drink and food prices $5 mandatory membership is reasonable",

It was just a shrug and 'better luck next time'.  went to the front desk and asked if this was normal and what should we do to better prepare for next time. Sarah <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fca.me&s=f6bae78ecdc4343f7f768502ed8b69061aaa5ede5723fdb4f6a991e4ad34ce19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ca.me</a> to the rescue, told me about the priority passes and we were in a bay within 20 minutes.

Service was good. No issues flagging down our waitress when we needed some more drinks. She was very helpful and cool.   The food? I took away a star just for the dry, lackluster food. We had the Thai chicken satay skewers and chicken pot stickers as appetizers. For the main course, there was the pickle fried chicken, beef brisket, green chili mac and cheese, beans, house salad with rolls.   All of it was pretty blase. The clear winner of the night was the beef brisket. And if we're going to talk about winners, we might as well touch on the loser, which was the green chili mac and cheese. Holy crap. It was unnecessarily dry and had very little flavor. It certainly didn't taste like any sort of chili, green or otherwise.  Aside from that, the location is easy to get to off the freeway and it's a little pricey, but it's an awful lot of fun when your target lights up at night!",

Seriously, fun for everyone, experienced or not. The twinkle of the talking stick casino in the background adds to the ambiance. The boys competed for the far white and blue circles in the back, it was my moms and sisters first time holding a golf club so they aimed for close red and yellow circles (and were able to) and for a middle of the road (like me) I aimed for the green. We had such a great time we ended up staying 3 hours. I think we had a pretty awesome spot; bay 309 if anyone is interested. The drinks are strong and their food is consistent with dressed up bar food. I will definitely be keeping this in mind for group outing or random date night in the future.",

Whether you need a fun place for a corporate outing, birthday celebration, bachelor party, retirement party, you name it, this is your place! Not only is the golf fun, but their food and drinks are spectacular as well! (Usually at these types of places, the food is 'eh' but not at Topgolf!!)   We came here for a company offsite and EVERYONE had a blast. I personally, am definitely not a great golfer (like, i'm lucky to even make contact with the ball), however, I was still able to score some points and most importantly, laugh and mingle with my teammates. The balls have a micro chip in them so that they can keep accurate scoring. We nibbled on delish appetizers like shrimp cocktail, antipasto skewers, pot stickers, and queso. Their Moscow Mules are also on point (and yes kids, they come in a copper mug here!).   I will most definitely be back for another fun occasion, or even just a date night, again soon!!",

Great for team building, family fun, stags,birthday parties etc... as there are a variety of games that can suit your abilities. Food was good but not spectacular but the golf pro(Taylor) was super helpful to the non golfers as well as the True golfers. Certainly a great place to have some fun for golfers and non golfers !!",

I had the Angry Orchard rose cider (yum) and we shared the grilled chicken sandwich with tots, the bao bun tacos with brisket and the pretzel bites with mustard and cheese.  Each bay is also outfitted with a TV, so you can watch whatever sports are on at that time - NBA playoffs for us!  We'll definitely be back for some more fun with friends!",

I had a party of 5 with a 4pm reservation and we only waiting 5 mins at the bar. Every single staff member that we encountered was extremely friendly and took very good care of us. We were escorted up to our bay. We were served by our waitress Lauren. We played for a full hour while enjoying food and drinks. The prices are fairly reasonable. Top golf is perfect for a family outing or even a fun date. The environment is very lively and has music playing in the background. You can dress comfortable as the attire is casual.  I highly recommend top golf to anyone that wants to have a good time and try something new. By the way, you do not have to be a pro golfer to have fun.",

    "text": "Top Golf where you spend a lot of money, that should be a slogan for them. Top Golf is nice it's close to everything you want like talking stick or even old town Scottsdale. This area is a fun and a growing area and you will have fun coming here if you have a good group of people. Friday-Sunday night there will always be wait times sometimes even to an hour which is expectable because it always happens with how buys this place is. If it's your first time you have to get a card that's 5$ but you get to keep it forever. You go to your bay or section and you slide the card into the machine and each player has to do that. It's basically like bowling. After that you select how long you want to play so 30 minutes to an hour to two hours it's on whatever you guys want but obviously more time more money. One hour is 45$ so you have to split that with your group. I've came her a couple of times over the year and the menu changed this last time I was there with new products and taking some things off. I ordered the Bacon and Cheese roll and they were out... The biggest picture on the appetizer page and they didn't have and the girl suggested it. I ordered chips and guacamole and they give you so much chips and barley any Guacamole or salads. Why?? Because they want you to order more obviously more $$$ but if you know good guacamole you won't be ordering more because it's tasteless and lacks flavor. Also my friends ordered the same and mine came out 5 minutes after.. Didn't really make any sense. I also ordered the quesadilla and it was gross they put so much peppers and no cheese at all for the price it truly sucks.. Don't get the peppers in it maybe it will be better. Another mistake they made where my food just came out late but we all ordered the same thing.. Like my friend got the same order and my quesadilla just didn't wanna come. I guess the girl forgot it so I reformed her and she said she'll go check after about 10 minutes I ask her again she replies with \"it's only been 7 minutes\" what kind of customer service is that??? Shouldn't I get \"oh I'm sorry it will be out soon\" just give me some BS don't reply with how longs it's been like it hasn't been long at all. Service is just terrible. The food all has no taste and had a big price.. So food sucks and you get a golfing experience but you can't smoke or vape. This place could be 100 times better if they knew what they were doing. It's fun but nothin",

There is a huge bar when you enter which help aid the wait and then bumping her out of wait list. Back drop ( have a photo shoot if like) to feel like you are a celeb! Ha! Reminded me of bowling but so much cooler. Pay $5 to get membership card. Then rent bay ( think lane if you were bowling) by the hour. Good music, misters and the servers bring you drinks.

She had never been to topgolf before and no one explained to her the process. She put our name down and requested two bays around 345 and she was quoted 30 minutes. This was perfect because every one was arriving around 4. We waited until 455 to be sat. UNREAL. We went up to the counter several times to check on the status of our group and the girl kept telling us ten more minutes. Absolutely unacceptable - just be honest and quote and hour and 15. We had dinner reservations at 730 25 minutes away and didn't start golfing until 500. When we were sat, we were told to quickly start so that we could receive the $35 an hour rate instead of the $45. Super unpleasant experience. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP. It was a nightmare.",

The place was super packed, cars lined down the street, and a wait of 2 hours....I was somewhat discouraged but, like I said, I was expecting this. Since we were visiting out of town we left and it actually worked out to our benefit because I got a text offer of $10 off since we weren't able to play.  We went back the next morning and the place was empty and wonderful. The game is great for anyone, even for my first timer wife and friends. We were able to do our own make shift brunch with their kitchen open and serving anything on the menu. The air was a little cool and they turned on these heaters that were amazing! You stay warm even though your outdoors! The service could have been better, hence the 4 stars. Our waiter seemed apathetic about serving and wasn't really attentive, but then again I was there for the golf!",

The entire time he was chewing on a straw. Unprofessional. We ordered food and before it came out our bay was ready. One employee told us we can transfer our tab no problem and they can bring the food out to the bay, but the bartender forced us to wait and close out our tab while our food was outside sitting at our table. This was frustrating since we planned on ordering more drinks later. Then they gave us a bay that was on the 1st floor when we requested 2nd or 3rd but since our food was already there we just stayed. They were out of multiple food items and hefeweizen beer that we ordered one then had to switch. Also, the holes were not counting our points so we had to manually put them in every time. When you pay $45/hr that is just wasting your paid time. It seemed like a joke to be honest when you spend $70+ for one hour of activity. Not worth it!",

There are many different games to choose from, some are easy and others are more advanced. A great place for anyone to hang out even if you have never hit a golf ball before. They do not allow drivers at this place but you are welcome to bring your own irons if you wish. The music is loud enough to enjoy but not so loud that you have a hard time carrying on a conversation with your team mates. The hourly rates are a bit pricy but I think it is worth the service and nice facility that comes along with it. I will be returning to this location quite frequently.",

    "text": "The golfing was great and the atmosphere was great and fun and we will definitely be back for that. This review is specifically for one of the staff members. I was with a group of 6 (3 guys and 3 girls) and we were all sitting at the bar waiting for a bay to become available. The 3 guys had their drink orders taken and delivered within about 5 minutes. Another 15 minutes passed and the other 3 of us girls still hadn't even placed our order. So we asked the guys in our party if they knew we were all together and the bartender heard us and ran over and started yelling at us saying we were rude and impatient and that they were busy and just because we are pretty girls doesn't mean the world should be handed to us... I was shocked and didn't even know what to say and all the other customers at the bar were staring and laughing. It was SO embarrassing. So then he's asks \"ok fine I'm here now, what do you want?\" My friend orders a Bloody Mary and her charge was about $8 and change. Then about 20 minutes later a new (and nicer) bartender came around and she ordered a second Bloody Mary and her charge was $6 and change, so we asked and he said that's the normal charge so why was she overcharged for the first one? It wasn't worth asking to save us from an argument and more embarrassment. Unfortunately we did not get his name but he is a bald man, looks maybe Philippino, but I can't be sure. If you see this guy when you're there, don't waste your time.",

At first our 3 girls ages 7, 8, and 10 were amused at the beautiful lightening! But then the lightening became the biggest rainstorm we had ever experienced! The rain was blowing on us, sand was getting into our eyes and food, and the girls became scared and wanted to leave asap! Michelle, the team shift leader, was so amazing with us and the girls! She credited our stay at Top Golf and invited us to come back the next night so we could have a better experience.  We came back the next night, she greeted us with a big smile and took care of us.  We had the absolute best time, the night was beautiful and we would definitely highly recommend anyone to come here for a fun and different golf experience. Thank you again Michelle for the fantastic customer service!",

However, everyone was super helpful and very friendly. My daughter had on a \"It's My Birthday\" Sash, so every employee who saw her came over to wish her a Happy Birthday. Her, her best friend, and a manager even did the \"Wobble\" when the song came on. Jenny took us to our bay and explained the game to us, she was super sweet. Michelle checked in on us all night to make sure our birthday girl was having a blast and at the end of the night she made sure we had a family picture. Dan, our waiter while we were in our bay, was absolutely amazing! He continually checked in on us and was super attentive to the birthday girl. He was even kind enough to take a picture with her and her best friend. He is a total doll and an amazing young man! Peggy Sue started us off right while we were waiting for our bay. The employees made sure to talk with each of us at the table (including my son and aunt) and even encouraged my son to apply and come to an interview next week. Thanks Topgolf for making our experience such a great one!",

You can only play big buck hunter so many times before you want to smash the screen in with that plastic gun. I'll get you one day you big buck....ahem...but I digress....The golfing games are very fun and even those who have never golfed in their lives would be welcomed here. Great spot to just hang out for a few hours and hvae some drinks with friends while making a fool out of yourself. You can either really impress your friends or completely leave them in stitches all based off your golf swing. Keep that in mind fellas if you are bringing a girl you want to impress. Drinks are strong, food is good, atmosphere is nice. Lost a star because of long long lines and a little bit of incompetence encountered with concierge, but besides that cool spot.",

    "text": "Tried this place after my sister told me about it. It was a pretty great place. A bit pricey depending on when you go and if you go with alone or just with another, but with enough people it's quite cheap and very reasonable. The only reason it's three stars is that the golf clubs that they provide have very wore out handles. We are not asking for a high line golf club or have the handles be replaces if there is a nix, but they were really wore and made it uncomfortavle to grip. Also, not all of the bays are a great location. The best is tight in the middle, we were placed on the edge and was easy to have the ball get caught in the net if it hooked without any chance to fall into one of the holes at all. We were also there for about an hour, so we didn't get any food or drinks so not sure if it was good or worth the price. Will need to revisit the place again in the future, hope they will have some in the LA area in the near future. I would still recommend this place for people to visit. I also need to visit this place at night because their range glows at night, or so I've been told.",

However the service we received last night was awful. It took at least 10-15 mins for our server to get to us. We had already finished one game. We ordered one round. Sat with empty drinks for a bit. So we decided to get a pitcher so we wouldn't be left wanting. It came with a chipped glass. Had to walk around to find someone to fix that. It was replaced quickly. Then it came time to pay our tab. Our games we finished our time was up. Had to track down our server. I like to pay with cash. While I am taking out my money, haven't even put it down yet the server asked if I needed change. Rude. We probably would have eaten too but we were never asked if we would like anything and our server was nowhere to be seen. Five stars for fun. Zero stars for service. I left with a sour taste in my mouth. Train your servers better. I will not be choosing to spend my money here again.",

All due to the fact that they had two special event parties that had basically bought out the place. Why in the world would they sell out the place on a Saturday night? Bad management decision. My recommendation - start taking reservations! I would have paid double to play even for an hour.",

In order to put our name in for a reservation we had to have the cards.  So we waited in the \"express\" reprint line for 30 minutes only to have a group of 15 guys be brought in front of us to have their cards reprinted.   There were only 2 of us and we had been waiting for 30 minutes already!  The group claimed they knew \"chris\" whoever the heck Chris is should figure out a better way to manage this place.  We stood and waited another 30 before leaving because we were so frustrated.   The place is so unorganized and dysfunctional I couldn't believe people could tolerate being there.   The lobby was a madhouse and the kids running the place had no idea what was going on.  I've been to topgolf before and thought it was fun, but I will never ever go back to this cage full of monkeys.  Get your sh*t together.",

I rejoiced when our birthday party of 12 called for a reservation and was told it was a 3 hour wait.   The second time I was told I was going to Top Gold I knew I wasn't getting out of it. We were going for a corporate team builder and had about 25 people in our group. Once we arrived I was amazed at the size of the place and that it was packed full on a Tuesday night. There are 3 stories of bays (private couch areas that fit about 6 people). The bays come stocked with both male and female clubs and a screen similar to a bowling set up where you can enter in your names and select the games you want to play.  I will admit when I am wrong, I had a blast! The service was awesome, we had someone come over and explain how to play and we quickly ordered cocktails and got started. The server kept everyone on a separate tab which made paying the bill at the end of the night a breeze.  The food was not bad, we did buffet style fajitas with rice and beans. It wasn't the most flavorful but pretty decent for a buffet and the focus here isn't really on the food.   I didn't score the highest but I had a fun time trying. Even if you are not a golf fan I would recommend this as a fun outing for large groups.",

Overall it was a fun experience but it would be nice if the entire process was more organized or at least better displayed to avoid confusion.

    "text": "I didn't realize it was opening week. Came here prime time, Saturday night at 730pm. Line was out the door and it was about 25 minutes, and it was just to get a membership card. The line died down a lot later, but I had to wait because I needed the membership card so I could go to concierge in order to put my name in for a bay. There's a hostess in front that answers your questions as you wait. At the time, it was an hour-1.5 hour wait, which was fine. We decided to hit up the restaurant while we wait.   The server got our drink order and wanted to take our credit cards to open a tab but she was gone for about 15 min, and no credit cards and no drinks, evidently the computers went down, which is also fine. it happens, especially opening day. But because of the delay, when the drinks and food finally came, our bay was ready, which they let you know via text. So we told our server, which they will take the food and bring it to your bay. The idea is pretty good, but the execution needed work. In addition to our food being moved around, my friend ordered a steak sandwich well done, but it came with a stick that said well done but it was very very pink, like medium rare, so he sent it back, and it was made again and it was rarer than the first! So the manager came and apologized and remade the sandwich again, and it was finally well done, and they comped his meal. So, in my opinion, it's opening week, busy as heck, I understand it's probably like Hell's Kitchen inside, and the manager resolved the situation. So I couldn't give a full five stars on my review.  Entertainment wise - the place was great! After getting our bay, a hostess goes over the options, answers questions, and how to operate everything. There can be up to six people playing in a bay and no experience necessary. You just hit the ball and the closer to the target and further the target, the more points you score. I haven't been to a driving range in over 5 years, and after a few practice swings, you get the hang of it. It's just like bowling but it's golf! You have 20 balls to score higher than your friends. Afterwards, we played some pool, shuffleboard and xbox games. Great fun and I totally recommend trying it out!",

Its a chill spot to go with family, have a fun night out with friends or just by yourself to hit some balls, major stress reliever. The atmosphere is fun and exciting, lots going on.  Been here a few times and always left very happy!  Unfortunately, this last visit our service was short of horrible. We sat at the bay for almost 15 min before I finally tracked down someone and asked for our server. What made it even worse was the table right next to us (5 males) had been checked on by same female server 3 times (when we started counting) without even acknowledging us, imagine our surprise when we realized that same female server was the one who ended up attending to us before passing us off to yet another server (who BTW was actually really great). (-1 star for service)  Guess its a good thing people don't go to topgolf for the service.",

    "text": "I am the Vice President of Product Marketing for Plantronics. We were launching a new set of products that we wanted to announce to our partners and customers. We needed a venue were we could have a first-rate meeting, show the products to our customers, but also something that might be different than a hotel ballroom. One of our team had heard of Top Golf and suggested it.  I was a little bit nervous because it is a non-traditional venue. I thought it might be too noisy and too distracting. I was also worried that the mix of professional and social might be off-putting to some of our customers. I was wrong.  We used the meeting room on the main floor. The AV facilities were first rate. There are lots of monitors and great overhead audio. We selected round tables all facing in. One of our presenters uses a wheel chair so we didn't want people seated too deep. The catering was very good. It was markedly better than typical hotel catering and more cost effective. The view from the room onto the field was superb but the black out curtains made sure it wasn't a distraction during our presentations. We did run into a small issue with hallway noise that was quickly rectified when we spoke to staff. We also noted that they weren't ideally situated for large equipment pack-in, pack-out. If this is something you need to do, I would have a storage truck in the parking lot and move in and out from there.  Speaking of staff, it was the staff that made the day. Thomas and Amber stood out as two people who just knew \"how to make it right\". The exceeded my expectations, not just by providing incredible, thoughtful service, but by caring about the success of our event. It felt very genuine. I have done a lot of events in any time, and I cannot recall enjoying working with a team so much. Of course there were many people on their team that were also involved --- too many to mention by name, but each person wanted to go out of our way. What's more, they weren't just doing this for us. I watched how they worked with the regular guests.  They really seemed to care. In any place, that would be amazing, but in this environment, it was especially unexpected and helped make our customers feel very welcomed.  Everyone enjoyed the social events of golf and pool. Being able to order food off me u rather than from some banquet list really kept everyone happy. The cocktails were a little premium-priced for straight up entertainment, but less than at a hotel venue.   We were so happy with our Product Launch. Our customers and partners loved it. The staff really made it work well. A different attitude from the staff and I am not sure this venue would have been as successful.  Roadside signage isn't ideal. Some people noted it was hard to find. The building is obvious once you know what you are looking for. It is a beautiful facility.  We will use this facility again and we will also look at other locations for similar events.",

After slicing and shanking away, I usually get in a comfort zone and start to hit fairly far and accurate-making myself feel better. If I can't do that, I'll just look around at the hundreds of people there that are struggling even worse than me-and that'll make me feel better instead.  The food and drinks here are really good, a bit more elevated than your standard sports bar type food. Some cocktails are a bit pricey, but, the more you drink the less you care about your crappy golf swing so you tend to go with it regardless. Atmosphere is fun, always neat to come with friends. If you are good at golf, bring your friends here and revel in the fact that you are superior to them.  Sometimes, the popularity of the place is a bit overwhelming so it gets a bit crazy. Going in the AM is both cheaper and less chaotic. I do sometimes get scared when a lane of children is next to me. Between the fear that their swing is so bad that I'll get hit and their erratic approach/follow-through that causes me to worry their about to tumble over the edge, it can be a be unnerving.",

Being from Seattle WA, we don't have anything like this back home and make a point to include Topgolf into our Arizona vacations, atleast once a year. This time though, we came in on a Saturday afternoon with our family and were expecting it to be busy. We were quoted a two and half hour wait time; long, but considered well worth it to us. We decided to sit in the bar and enjoy appetizers and drinks while we waited to golf. When we were reaching our quoted time, we went to the front to ask about how much longer we could expect. The person working informed us that their systems had been down that day causing longer delays and that it was going to be about another hour and half on top of the two and half hours we already waited! Being highly disappointed, we decided to leave. We understand that stuff happens, but they should've let us know about the system delays and extra long wait times upfront so we could've decided to go else where instead of wasting one of our vacation nights waiting for nothing. We could've spent our waiting time driving to the other location if we knew it was going to be THAT long. Like I said, we only make it down here a couple times a year and look forward to visiting Topgolf everytime. Between the 7 of us, we spend atleast $300+ each visit. We were so disappointed I don't know if we'll waste our time coming back. Topgolf is fun, but not worth having to wait 3-4 hours, especially when we're here out of town for only 3 nights.

    "text": "This is my second post since first going to the TG Scottsdale. The first time was on Fathers Day this last June 2104 about 4 days after the grand opening. It was a crazy disorganized day, but not unexpected. On the whole I was pleasantly surprised, given my initial skepticism, that this format would work for a modern driving range. On that first visit my wife had overpaid and TG gave us a credit for a future visit.   So Labor Day we ventured out again, to sample another TG experience. The checking in process was painful, considering we had a TG issued credit, that no-one could figure out how to enter into their computer system. We were bounced back and forth between check in and concierge, and finally the manger had to use his own override to fix it. So up we went to a third floor bay. It was empty up there, and somewhat of a surprise. The bay would not accept the credit issued and we waited 20mins to get this resolved.   Then I noted they had no woods or hybrids in the TG rack? Why I thought. Turns out its because most modern golfers now, can clear the far fence and hitting cars in the Talking Stick Casino parking lot. Ok bad design flaw TG .   So why can't women use some as required and handed back after the session is complete? My wife prefers these clubs and does not have a long range, so she did not enjoy the very limited clubs on offer, which by the way have horrible grips now, after only 3 months.   I'm confused what Top Golf is trying to be, because if it's families then I'm offended I can't be trusted to behave with a long club or 3 wood while on the other hands perhaps the liquor and beer crowd cannot, hence the long club ban.   It's already beginning to unravel which is a pity, because it has great potential for both families and millennials looking for a bucket of beers, nachos and to drive some cool shots 250 yards.   It's meant to be a driving range, so make it one.",

    "text": "Went there in May 2015 for my mother's birthday party. The party consisted of 12-15 people. My father pre-ordered quite a selection of food to be served buffet style.... He mistakenly ordered entirely too much food! Quite literally there was enough to feed 40-50 people easily. We had so much food in fact... Much to the chagrin of the staff, my dad offered food to the 8-10 college aged kids at the bay next to us which they were very delighted and accepted. There was so much food... Everybody was figuring out who was taking what but then \"the manager\" (what a tool) informed us we \"can't take any food home, it's against the health code\". If been to umpteen restaurants in Scottsdale and they always bring out a to-go box. I think the staff was extremely upset because they could see now that multiple bays next to us the guests were eating the \"catered food\" & was adversely affecting there business. Ridiculous.       Also, if you go there when it's hot, they have industrial unsightly misters that will do nothing but get your clothes damp/wet. My eyeglasses literally had to be wiped every 20 sec. When asked to adjust the settings, we were told there was \"nothing they could do\".      Finally, if you like to golf enough to where you own your own clubs... BRING THEM!  The \"house clubs\" are so bad and beat up. Top golf couldn't have bought them at even at a second hand store. These clubs would be something you'd find in your grandfathers attic from circa 1972. Oh and BRING YOUR MONEY AND BE READY TO PART WITH IT!!! Simply take a look around at their multi-million dollar facility. The customers pay dearly for it with their outrageous gouge pricing on everything",

The food area was packed with loud drunk people. The waiter forgot to put in three of our orders but it still took an hour to get the food he didn't forget. We had to wait an additional half hour for some chicken tenders and chicken and waffles. When we finally got our food they messed up both burger orders. The waiter was nice enough about it. Generally the workers are nice.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Murray Head - One Night in Bangkok)  Topgolf, Occidental setting But Scottsdale does know what the city is getting The creme de la cream of the golf world In a game with everything but Tiger Woods  Time flies - doesn't seem a minute Since the Arizona Casino spa is just across from it All changed, don't you know that when you Play at this level there's no ordinary venue It's Tempe, or Chandler, or Gilbert Or Or this place!  One night at Topgolf and the world's your oyster The bars are open but their drinks aren't free  Top Golf ... what is the rave about!?  Needless to say this place is pretty awesome.  I'm not much of a golfer but I can see the fun in coming here to wack the hell out of a golf balls while pounding down a few drinks.    The place itself is huge; 3 floors of fun and a central bar inside.  The crowd and staff is lively and service seems on key. Though I'm sure they have seen and dealt with the worst; dealing with drunk golfers - ishh!  I came here for a birthday party and didn't seem like any of our orders missed a beat.  I ordered a beer and a some chicken tacos and had a taste of the Mushi, a burrito like appetizer stuffed with beans, rice, cilantro, cheese, and chicken.  It's shaped like a sushi thus I gather the name Mushi. My thought, well mushy indeed it was since it felt it was just a bunch of \"mushy\" ingredients stuffed together in a roll; I appreciate stepping outside the box, but please stay shut Pandora's Box!  My chicken tacos however were awesome! Crispy taco shell stuffed with smoked chicken and atop with a slaw.  Smoky it was while the shell and the slaw provided a textural crunch to every bite.  Perfect to go along with my beer.  It has some heat along, but the cabbage slaw helped calm it down.  Overall, a darn good bite for a fun golf place! - Enjoy!",

Not once. Ever. Did waitstaff approach the table. Never. Did I say never? My companion went to order food at the bar - I asked for the grilled cheese off the kids menu because I did not want meat. They plop a brisket grilled cheese in front of me. I say something about how this has meat and the waiter says \"yeah it's awesome and walks away\" never to be seen again.   Want a water? Have to go to the bar. Want a drink? Have to go to the bar. Want the food you ordered? Go somewhere else.   Maybe next time I'll get to play and my review will change.",

We ordered some food and had some drinks while we waited.    The food took a long time to come out. They called our group at the same time our food finished. They sent our food down to our bay but made us pay the bill upstairs causing some of our meals to get cold.    The golfing itself was a blast and thats why the 4 stars.  We all had a great time even if we are not very good golfers. Since we were in a big group the price was actually pretty cheap. Better time and cheaper than bowling.   Wish we had a top golf in the bay area!",

    "text": "Well, we're probably not your typical clientele.   An Uncle and his 13 year old nephew.  We're from North Phoenix, not dressed right, not golfers, certainly not there for drinking at 8 AM on a Saturday.  Only reason I'm there is from sharing the wealth after winning at poker from the Talking Stick (a stones throw away) the week before.  And from the moment we walked up, we get the Scottsdale stuffy that I half expected.   \"What up?\" from the front desk guy, not a \"Hi, can I help you?\".   A manager looking lady gives my nephew some vague warning about how he can't bring his Dad's club up to the range, as if he's a threat of some kind.   \"You'll have to walk that back to the car, sonny.\"   Then, after doubling back, We get the brief instruction on the electronic scoresheet as almost an afterthought - didn't tell us how to switch players or even how to get the next ball out of the machine.  But the waitress Kaylan shows up, drops off our water (sorry, but no alcohol for you, young fella, she says).   And then when she sees that we are total hackers, she goes ahead and offers, \"would you guys like any tips?\"   \"Sure\".  \"Well you might start with the men's club rather than the women's....\" And goes on to correct the nephew's stiff swing, slows down my rushed approach and in short improved both of our games by 100%.  She goes on to check in on us every 15 minutes to see how we are progressing, giving my nephew a confidence surge with each correction and by the end of the day, the \"kid\" is during 160-180 yards with semi-consistency.   Obviously, Kaylan went out of her way, where any normal waitress would've said \" well, won't be getting any tips here\" and instead saw us as the eager-to-learn beginners that we really were.  Kaylan's made this spot visit worth every minute.",

    "text": "We visited Topgolf a few days ago as a party of 4 kids (8-11yrs old) and 4 adults. While we probably should have registered and made a reservation ahead of time, the staff were not flustered, they worked quickly, joyfully and efficiently. The staff engaged the kids, walked them through the safety, the computer and game play. We were swinging clubs within 15 minutes of coming through the door on a pretty busy night, which was in itself impressive.  The server was very attentive to the adults and kids. The music, beverages and food etc. were perfect for our families. The staff were hungry to please and make sure our needs were met. We left feeling like this is a place we would want to bring our kids every time we are in Scottsdale even for a snack and some refreshments. Our kids were talking about it on the plane ride home.  The impeccable service didn't end there. When we got home to Canada we realized that one of our kids left their own club in a rental set that night. Naturally we were upset and being 2500 km away we were not hopeful. We sent an email to Topgolf and within 24 hrs the Director of Instruction, Jesse Hughes PGA, called me to say he had our club and he wanted to make sure we got it back. His concern for my child being without her club was palpable on the phone and as I type the club is on its way back to me courtesy of Topgolf.  It is clear to me that Topgolf has great culture, they hire talented individuals and place a premium on the client experience. Thank you Jesse and team, your service has left a lasting impression on us and we cannot wait to come back and say thanks in person.  On a final note, golf needs more champions like Jesse and his team to grow the game, this was a \"home-run\" for Topgolf and for the game of golf.",

    "text": "Cool concept. Topgolf combines the ease of play that putt-putt golf provides with a game-like atmosphere similar to bowling in a driving range setting. There are 3 levels which can fill up fast on the weekends, so getting there early is recommended.  We came here for a friend's birthday party and enjoyed the beautiful weather. There are different games that you can play, all centering around hitting your golf ball in a certain colored zone. This means that even though you might be a seasoned golfer, you won't necessarily gain points if you don't hit the ball in the exact area where the zones are. You can bring your own clubs, or they have ones at the range that you can use, separated by number/type and by what distance they can hit.  Prices here are by the hour, and are tiered by time (Morning, afternoon, evening). The morning times are the cheapest by the hour, with prices increasing as you approach evening. We got here around 9 A.M. when they open, and there was already a line out the door.   In addition to the driving range, there are overhead TVs so you can watch professional golf while playing golf, an indoor lounge area, and tables where you can snack, imbibe, or have a full meal. The menu itself consists of bar/party type food such as fries, sandwiches, and some wonderfully delightful donut holes that you fill with your choice of 3 different flavors.  Service here was excellent, provided by our server Ashley.   Overall it's a fun place if you're looking for a group activity that provides casual sport, food, and entertainment. Just be sure you know how to swing that golf club without injuring yourself, since I twisted my wrist while swinging and it's still a little sore a few days later!",

Meaning the web site and phone recorder says no reservations bullsh$&!!! But, when you get past it all, it's like a fine working clock works for some reason. Throughout the chaos and the mayhem things all fit together as one.  Thank god we ran into Beverly, she was a god send, she was very organized, friendly and most of all patent. It was nice getting an explanation from someone so gifted as her.   Once you get through the queue nightmare it really is very nice. A beautiful dining / bar area. Very nice bartenders who sling a premium drink. After an hour away, which wasn't too long considering we were sitting at the bar and having drinks, we were texting to go to the concierge for our position on the course. Once you get there I host it takes you to the course and explained everything to you so you know it backwards and forwards, and then explains the games. He did a great job. The games are great a lot of fun Lotta good fun competition and I recommend this place highly.",

Staff is awesome and encouraging. They also don't push you to buy more, or upgrade, or seek lessons. That's something any consumer can appreciate. You need to be careful about avoiding peak hours - not only do they get VERY busy, but the price to play can jump up a lot. It's $25 per hour in the mornings, but $50 per hour in the evenings. I think I'll stick to my morning golf routine :)",

Drinks would arrive in waves because \"no one could find our table\" in the bar and server would have to bring them. They also ran out of bloody mary mix at 3 pm on a Saturday.    Bays are dirty and are not cleaned, other than the tables, in between guests.

It was so much fun to just watch as well! Some of us never played golf so this was a first time experience. You can order food and drinks and enjoy your time.

This place is a such a cool concept and I wish there was one closer to me back home.  It's almost like a sheek bowling alley type feel, but outdoors with a fancy driving range with large targets.  They have heat lamps and comfy seating and casual bar type food and lots of drink options.  You can set up different competitions and the clubs are provided and score is kept digitally and shows up on a screen above.  The only major drawback is the place is a bit pricy.  At the end of the day it's a driving range and you are rotating turns and will probably spend $50-75 if you get a couple drinks and food and play 2 hours like we did.  Still the night was very enjoyable, and I would definitely go again.",

For those that don't play they did have some golf \"instructors\" there.   My personal experience having grown up golfing but not being an avid golfer today, it was fun, I could see it being fun for a family a group of friends or a company party. That being said it wasn't hard to notice the golfers in the group they were whacking the ball 200 plus yards then trying to remain calm as one of the women or I never golfed players dribbled the ball 25 yds but outpointed then by getting closer to pin....  Love that!!!     To the golf guy it's basically a driving range with open bar and some munchies with the scoring  I would say it's a step above miniature golf it's a better date for adults with the added benefit of drinks n food as you play.  If your hoping to show your stuff be careful Top Golf May humble you, but if your looking to have fun, give it a shot. !",

Literally a five minute wait until we could get a bay we're a family of four so it's pretty awesome. seriously you can't beat $35 for one hour of top Golf. I feel like that's pretty reasonable and being that they go by the hour not by the person. Also the food here is pretty awesome we enjoyed the chips with queso.  The staff who works out in your bay happens to be a lot  more friendlier and have better customer service than the people on your front desk and your customer service center.  We definitely will be coming to this location and time and time again Nothing but a great Sunday afternoon with my family and shooting some golf balls",

    "text": "\"It's in the hole!\" Interestingly, no one in our group uttered these words during our visit to Top Golf in Scottsdale. Our office gathered at this Talking Stick destination for an early holiday celebration last week. Regardless of ability, this facility offers a unique take on the typical driving range.  I've played many traditional driving ranges. I've also visited multi-deck ranges. In spite of this, I'm not much of a golfer. It doesn't matter because what Top Golf offers, clearly appeals to everyone from the novice to much more avid golfers. Sure, you can step up and just crush the ball all day. Unlike more traditional driving ranges where distance is all that matters, this range offers a variety of targets and automated scoring. Points are scored when your ball lands in one of the oversized holes below. The closer to the flag, the more points you score. Low score is out the window. How wonderfully un-golf like!  Besides the beautiful setting and the amazing facility, the kitchen can produce some very tasty items. Our group played off of three tees and a nice assortment of snacks and desserts were provided nearby. The only flaw with our outing came at dusk as our time was winding down. Those of us still swinging and hacking away quickly realized how difficult it is to track a golf ball as the daylight fades.  Top Golf is a unique venue for group activities as well as individuals. I'm happy to have been introduced to this range, because after years of working on my short game at miniature golf courses, I feel compelled to bring my sons out here for an afternoon. Who knows, we may even see the Dalai Lama.",

I have been to Topgolf a couple of times now and enjoyed myself, but I just can't see the value in paying $45/hour for this activity especially when you add in overpriced food and drinks.  And you also need to pay $5 per person to \"sign up\" on your initial visit to Topgolf.  The machines are slow to switch between players and even slower at providing you with your next golf ball to hit... so even if you are hitting balls non-stop (which no one would or could do), you still would not be able to hit more than maybe 120 balls in an hour.  And most groups are going to waste additional time eating, talking, drinking, and just not focusing on hitting balls as fast as possible.    When your time is up, then you are asked to move out of that area within minutes, regardless of whether you still are finishing up your food and drink.  Mind you, this last visit happened to be on a Tuesday and we experienced this again.  With the prices of the food and drink, it's a fairly expensive \"meal\" where you get to hit a few golf balls.   I will most likely visit this or other locations again periodically, but the True enjoyment of going to Topgolf is in socializing with the people in your group.  ***3 STARS***",

He went over the rules and explained everything really well. I'm very impressed with the service here. We've ordered some food and drinks. If anything special comes - good or bad - I'll update this review. My only peeve is that everything seems a tad overpriced looking at the menu and the cost of gameplay for the allotted time.",

    "text": "Such a fun spot for a day or night out with friends. You can reserve spots ahead of time (sometime it's an additional fee of $50!) or just wait for an opening.   Our group of 7 decided to wait around, especially because there was an area downstairs with cornhole, a pool table, shuffle board, and other games. It was really nice to offer this area for guests who have to wait. We also ordered some beer and appetizers too for a hefty price.   Our bay was ready for our group and we all had a great time! We're not the best golfers, so it was fun to try to aim for the various targets. Our server was friendly and attentive as well.   Prices are not cheap, but if you come with a group of people, it'll be more affordable to split the cost. Overall, I'd definitely recommend a visit here! I wish there were locations in California!",

Our group was just there to have a good time - we are NOT golfers. We looked around at others wearing gloves and hitting the balls so far and got really intimidated. All we were doing were swinging and missing! An employee named Darel literally saved the day and made our night. I cannot thank him enough and he's the reason we all left thinking it was the most fun night we had in a while.  He came over and gave us all a mini golfing lesson, one by one, taking turns. Then he came back every once in a while to see if we needed help and were having a good time. Those swings and misses turned into shooting star balls by the end of the night. I couldn't believe I could ever hit a ball so far!! We ordered food and drinks and had an amazing few rounds of hitting those golf balls into the fun different colored ranges.  I can't wait to come back! Thanks for an amazing experience! PS it's inexpensive too and did I mention super FUN?!",

In fact, I'm a decent golfer and I feel I am at a disadvantage because I try to go for the further targets while my friends who have never golfed just aim for the closest targets.  We always have a great time when we go.  Food and drinks are very good, but are a little too expensive.",

If each person wants to have a profile to keep track of their score, that will be $5/person to start our.   The \"Rockstar in Training\" in the green shirt, short hair, skinny boy said the wait would be \"30 minutes to 45 minutes....you should get a text on your phone\". We waited for a little over an hour, and noticed plenty of parties have come and gone. We went back to the Guest Services, found the same boy and brought the issue to his attention. He asked if we received a text. Obviously not, or else we would already be playing now. So he said next open area will be ours. We waited for another half an hour before we were assigned a bay area number.  TL;DR What a waste of money when you can go get a real experience at a golf course without this bullshit. This is our first time here and we are appalled by the customer service provided. Not worth the money and we will never return to any Topgolf locations.  Girls, feel free to dress skanky and show tons of skin here. The environment can be quite trashy. Looks like spoiled college students are willing to spend for this kind of service.",

    "text": "I highly doubt that I will be returning here. I booked online and the experience started off great, yet quickly went downhill. Upon arrival we go to our bay and get ourselves all set up. Once we get started playing a gentleman comes up and tells us that we can only stay for an hour due to an event. That is fine but why put us in a bay that you then have booked for an event? They did say that they could move us if we wanted to stay for more than an hour, but the customer experience from that is not par (no pun intended).   We keep playing in the same bay as we only intended to stay for an hour. I brought my own clubs as online it says we are allowed to bring our own clubs (online does not state if there are any restrictions to clubs). I am playing with my 7 iron, and then I bring out my driver and start hitting a few balls. Quickly a different gentleman than before comes up and informs us that we cannot use our own clubs. I did not want to start any sort of argument or make anyone feel uncomfortable so I kindly put away my driver and only played with my 7 iron for the rest of time.  You might be saying \"Why not just use the clubs that are provided?\"  I have a few wrist and hand injuries that require me to play with special grips to prevent me from having pain shoot up my arms when I make contact with the ball.  Upon leaving I start calling top golf locations and asked a few questions.  Me: Are we allowed to bring our own clubs? Rep: Yes, you are...we encourage it if you prefer your own. Me: Are there any restrictions on the clubs that we are allowed to use? Rep: Nope, you can use whatever you like. (Kind goodbyes between me and the rep)  Having a club friendly atmosphere is great, but it is not great if a staff member is going to just flat out say you cant use your club(s) or certain club(s) when the website and the phone reps say that you can bring your own clubs in with no restrictions?",

We ordered chips and guacamole which you would think would be a pretty quick appetizer...it was part of that one hour wait I told you about. I mean I think they're planting and harvesting the damn avocados. Like I said, this was a Monday night it wasn't busy and I didn't see any avocado trees... Oh yeah and the chips came out stale. And the manager somehow tricked my uncle into purchasing Top Golf memberships when he was told they were free lol! But that was some kind of ridiculous miscommunication.

I don't know how anyone can not love this place.  Few tips: if you are with new golfers, aim for an hour and a half to two max. once arms get tired it can get a little messy. also, people love to rent this place out (or a large portion of it), so check ahead of time and go during a time/day during the weekend that is not a charity event or company party.",

    "text": "Topgolf is definitely a good place to go if you want to have a fun and relaxing night with your family or friends. This place offers a multitude of different things. If you wanted to, you could play golf, go shopping in \"gift shop\" area, eat good food, and watch tv all at the same time. Topgolf was a great concept to make but it does have its flaws. The biggest issue I had with this place was the long wait times you have before you can rent out a Bay Area. We went on a calm Wednesday night and the wait time for us in a group of 4 was 1 1/2 hours. Seems a little long for me considering they were not that busy and it was the middle of the week. My other issue was how expensive this place was. Depending on what time of day you go, you can expect to pay anywhere from $25, $35, or $45 per hour on Sun-Thurs or $50 per hour on Fri and Sat. This was all just to rent out an area and nothing else. To me, it's really not a place you can go all the time but I do find that it s good place to visit for a good time every now and again. On a side note, the staff was one of the things that made the experience that much better. They were all very helpful, attentive, and kind no matter what we asked them. They were truly amazing people.",

We ended up going back tonight to Scottsdale...they never lied to us about wait times...and we pretty much got right in.  It was a fantastic experience. The server Lucky was very good, did a great job...the food was excellent, which i expected to be mediocre at a place like that.     Only issue was they messed up a grilled cheese sandwich, we sent it back, and they charged us for another??? I assumed that was an over-site, and some procedural error in getting new food out when an order is messed up...it was only $6.00 so not worth the hassle to go back.  All that said we had a great time, excellent and attentive service from the time we walked in the door to the time we left.",

I'll preface my review with the fact that I don't golf, I'm not good at golf, and don't like playing. If this is you you'll definitely have fun here and if you like golf then you'll be in heaven!   We had an event reservation and a buffet style dinner. Of the offerings I enjoyed the pesto macaroni salad, the country style beans, the brisket was just ok but the BBQ sauce helped in that department, and the full yourself doughnut holes were super yummy.   As for golf I loved that they had some good tunes playing and at intervals the holes would dance with light in sync with the music.  The final kicker for me was seeing the staff really enjoy themselves. They were dancing, laughing, overall it seemed like they were having fun which I really enjoy to see.",

Every food order was wrong from the kitchen. The line to get a new card was moving so slowly, it was out the door and out into the parking lot, and took us over an hour to get through. The computers kept crashing, the registers went down at the bar, the game consoles shut down, etc. A waitress dropped an entire tray of drinks and a pitcher at the back of our bay, then disappeared. My sister had to grab all of our napkins to stop it all from running into our green! It seems like they made a recruiting run at the local retirement home. The (obviously too old) lady inside the front door asked us four separate times if we were new players within a 10 minute time period, and the parking nazi out front was the final straw. He wouldn't let us stop in front to pick up the rest of our party, just kept repeating \"you can't park here\" as we tried to explain we were just picking up. He was so mean and rude!! I guess if they're trying to scare off customers, they're doing a great job.",

    "text": "It saddens me to write this review. I am truly a big fan of Top Golf. I've played in Houston and it was love at first site.  I would rate the Houston location 5 stars. This location is the exception. The biggest strike against it is that it plays short... meaning you must leave all your woods (metal) in the car. The only thing you can hit are your irons. For a driving range, this is sacrilege!!!  Their \"long drive\" game is no more than a 4 or 5 iron.  Someone seriously messed up when designing this location.  To add to the disappointment, the staff (including the manager) acted as if I should be grateful to pay the high rates for the pleasure of working only on my short game.  Therefore;  I say \"never again\".  If you can't take the big dog out of the bag, grip it, and rip it, then how can you call yourself a \"driving range\"?  This location would be better off calling itself \"Short Golf\".  I felt like the director in charge at the time was the \"Soup Nazi\". Her attitude was \"you will like it or you get no golf\". What a shame for this brand.   So, if you don't really want to work on your golf game and all you want to do is eat, drink and hit some balls, you'll like this place once you get through the long lines and slow service. The \"Top Golf\" concept is amazing; however, the execution at this location is poor at best.",

My family was here from North Dakota and excited to go check it out. Instead they made me feel like some criminal since I supposedly made my golf ball over the fence. Wouldn't even allow me to sit there while my family to had a good time. I will never recommend any friends or family to go there.",

We arrived to a big line waiting on the stairs to get in, to be told we had to buy a\"lifetime membership\".I thought that was odd.   We waited for an hour and the other feature is they want your driving license, which they claim makes it easy to populate your membership into the computer. Not convinced about that.   Once we were signed in we went to a third level bay. The hostess ran through the basics too quickly, but we figured it out. It was a lot of fun and a clever use of technology to track your shots.   We ordered some basic brunch items which were fresh, hot and tasty. Cocktails are expensive. Beer not bad.  My wife thought it was $25 per person before noon, but that was 1 hr in the bay. Good value actually.  We had fun and even being outside in June, the mister fans worked really well to keep you cool.   All in all a great experience.  We will go back in the evening and maybe they will get 5 stars. Good job so far TG.",

We had drinks, then went to the bays to hit some golf balls and have a buffet.   The buffet was a fairly deluxe salad, chicken skewers, salmon and roasted potatoes. The food was okay. I found the entrees the weaker portion and the salad/potatoes the better fare.   The golf was fun. You get up to six people per bay, hitting 20 balls each. They have eleven targets and each ball has a microchip so it senses when and where you hit one of the targets. It then assigns points, if you want to keep score.   I'll return with friends next time but without the food.",

    "text": "I have been going to various topgolf locations since the early days in Dallas and have seen the company evolve and continuously improve. Generally, my experience at top golf has been nothing but great.   Shuffling customers in and out of bays as efficiently as humanly possible is now topgolf's primary goal.   In the first 3 minutes that we were at our bay, I had 3 different employees come up and try to get me to login and get the game clock running. Ok, so we get logged in and got the game clock running. We started hitting a few balls, then decided to order some food and drinks. I only put the bay at 30 minutes to start because we planned on taking a quick break to eat some food (maybe 15 minutes tops), but how top golf operates now, once you cross the 15 minutes left threshold, a waitress will come to you and tell you that you are about to run out of time and would you like to add more. I mentioned we were going to eat for a few minutes then kick the games back on. To my surprise, this was not allowed any more, and once the clock starts at your bay, it must stay running or you are a worthless customer and must be shuffled out for the next, even if you're buying buckets of beers and multiple entrees. Okay, so I got over it, we kept it running and the waitress gave us a complimentary 15 minutes (reason for 2 stars instead of 1). We proceeded to order beers and play games for the next hour and a half. Towards the end of our last game we ordered a final round of beers and minutes later crossed the 15 minute threshold and there you have it, a waitress pops up within seconds to see if you want to maintain your claim to the throne. I kindly said no, we will finish out our time and head out once we finish our drinks. You'd think after you just spend $175 on food, drinks, and games that they would allow you to finish your drink at the table. Nope, we were awkwardly kicked out of our bay as the employees brought over some new customers to get the clock rolling.   From my perspective, I work in finance and completely understand where topgolf is coming from. If you are maximizing your bottom line at all costs, then top golf has found a way to do it. It's efficient and well operated. But at what cost? You may have just lost a customer for life because you value every second of the bay racking dollars instead of making sure the customer experience is top notch. My only complaint here is to find a balance with all of this. It just seems topgolf is losing sight of some important values it should maintain.",

Our bay had cushy couches and our server Kenny was prompt and attentive. Try the Mushi! Spicy and delish.   I've never golfed before so I was nervous I'd really suck and wouldn't have fun. Not so!

    "text": "If at first you don't get in, try, try again! This is what I told myself after visiting the first time on a Saturday night only to learn that it was a three-hour wait for a bay (the private golf areas). The next time we tried to visit, we came at a down time and luckily scored a bay right away! I'm so excited to see a place like Top Golf come to the Valley. My only question is, what took them so long and why don't other fun entertainment spots like this open up more often!?   Golfer or not, this is a really fun time and it's family-friendly so Mom & Dad can have a cocktail while the children play! It's like a driving range meets a bar meets a golf arcade. Now, if you are a golfer, you might never want to leave and if you aren't a golfer, this might kick start you into wanting to play. We had a lot of fun and can't wait to continue to visit, especially when the weather cools down!  Here's how it works.   1. First time you visit, you will go to the check-in counter and buy a card for $5. This card will serve as your license to golf and that means you can bypass the first counter on your next visit. You will also pay for the first hour which varies in price depending on the time of day: $25 an hour (total, not per person) from open until Noon, $35 an hour from Noon-5 and $45 an hour from 5:00 until close.   2. After you've signed up and purchase your card and first hour, they send you over to the concierge where they will set you up with your bay or put you on a wait-list depending on the time of day.   3. Now that you're set up, you can head over to your bay and start to play. The bay comes with golf clubs and a private area with couches and misters so even if you don't want to play, you can still hang out and watch!   4. The bays run by the hour, so when your hour is up, you can pay for another half hour or hour right at your bay, making it easy (and pricey!)  5. You will get your own server at your bay and they offer a full bar and full menu of tasty food.  *** If you just want to come and drink, they also have a full bar set-up so you don't have to rent a bay. ****  Tips:  1. If you're a golfer, you can bring your own clubs.   2. If you like to play with a glove, bring it with you.   3. Wear comfortable clothes.   4. You don't need golf shoes but I suggest you wear closed toed shoes. I played in flip flops and it wasn't very fun.   5. If you don't want to play golf, you can still hang out with your friends in the bay while they play.",

One of the employees came over and understandably reprimanded him. He apologized for the mistake, offer to pay for it and apologize to party. Although I tried to stop the employee, they took the fresh food from under him and threw it right in the garbage!   They ignored our solution and chose an ignorant one. When I reminded the manager that people die from starvation  + an animal was slaughtered for the food,  he claimed there was no other way to handle the incident.  ..so the answer was to GRAB THE FOOD FROM UNDER YOUR GUEST AND THROW IT IN THE TRASH??!

After ordering food and drinks, it took nearly the full paid hour to receive our food, after reminding the wait staff we had ordered. They managed to squeeze out another half hour, which I am sure is by design.   Once the food finally arrived we played some more golf and decided to make the most of our time getting additional balls to hit after the time expired. While the wait staff was nearly non existent during our playing time they happened to be cleaning the bay next to us and decided to push all the remaining balls over the edge, because of an arbitrary rule of not having more than one ball out at a time.   Felt sorry for the people below and thought that could be more dangers than having a few extra balls on our faux grass. We looked at the posted rules and could find nothing about such a violation.   We decided next time we would just go to a regular driving range with a few flasks and will find another way to spend the $200 we will save by not going back to Top Golf.",

The recently opened driving range lets you bring your canines along for the ride, who can relax on cushioned couches as you bounce off balls into targets throughout the range.  Its dog-friendliness isn't its only draw. Anyone will have fun at Topgolf, whether you're a pro with the sticks or not. Each hole has its own misted and fanned lounge area, with servers delivering drinks and food as you compete against your friends.  There are full bars on both golfing levels, as well as a rooftop bar, and fire pits and extra lounging areas give a great view of Valley sunsets, making it a bonafide Scottsdale rooftop bar contender.  For those who do golf, up to six people can compete against each other to score points by hitting balls into one of the netted areas. Rates are hourly, after you pay a $5 membership fee. It's $25/hour between open-noon, $35/hour between noon-5 p.m. and $45/hour between 5 p.m.-close. Divided by a group of six, that's not too bad, and I loved it as a new fun alternative to group bowling.  Something I wasn't a fan of was that woods and drivers are not allowed, only irons. A driving range where you can't use your driver?! Yep.  Apparently too many people were hitting the ball over the fence into Talking Stick Resort area. Bummer.  Still, it's pretty darn awesome to hit balls in cool air to Top 40 music.",

    "text": "I went to Top Golf convinced I was NOT going to enjoy myself.  I do not care for golf. Not even mini-golf, but my work was going for \"team building\" and I showed up.   The cost isn't bad - 35 for a bay, and 5 dollars a person for a card. I personally didn't golf, but the rest of my team did. They all raved about the different games you could play with the \"micro chipped\" balls.   The food was wonderful, the drinks were plentiful. Originally, we were in a bay where the fan was broken, so they moved us, and it was MUCH cooler.   The only gripe, is a coworker of mine ordered a burger, and asked for guac - the food runner was convinced the order was \"not right\" (though it looked right!) because of the guac - and the poor girl had to wait an extra 20 minutes while they \"found\" her food. They insist this made a new once since they \"lost\" it - but she was convinced, they brought her the original one. Food runners can be a necessity, but make sure they know people CAN custom order extra toppings.",

I was let down when the hostess took our player cards and never gave them back but when I returned Richard went out of his way (keep in mind this place is SUPER busy at the 7pm hour on a Friday) to make is new cards super fast. We always ha e fun here and for good reason. It's fun!  No review needed to let you know you should put effort in to get to this place. Thanks Richard!",

    "text": "Was overall disappointed with my first visit to the Scottsdale Top Golf location after having very positive experiences at the Gilbert location. We went with a group of 6 people and had a 10% off coupon. We presented the coupon to the front desk but decided not to request our bay until our entire group arrived to not start the time clock. We decided to share one bay rather than two bays because we were told the only two bays were on the first floor. The place was slammed on the Friday afternoon around lunch time. By the time our group arrived we went back to the front desk and were told that we would have to go to guest services to apply the coupon and pay, this would have been helpful to know the first time we went up because the line for guest services was over 30 people deep. We finally paid and waited another 10 minutes to be shown to the bay and were super frustrated to be shown to the first floor after already indicating we didn't want to be there. The staff member had misquoted the hourly rate for the bay and ran the wrong persons credit card for the difference so our first ten minutes in the bay was working to correct his error with no attempt to waive the misquoted rate. We got set up and our waitress arrived, service was decent, nothing special. I ordered a burger with bacon and fried egg, the bacon was super fatty and not crisp, I ended up pulling it off. I ordered a ranch with my meal but she forgot it so by the time she brought it out my tater tots were cold. From start to finish this was just a pretty bad experience, such a disappointment since I have really enjoyed going to Top Golf in the past. I had thought about going to Top Golf for my birthday next month with a group of friends but now I think I will have to find somewhere else to go.",

    "text": "This ain't yer old-school driving range. Remember back then?  You pay a few bucks, get a bucket of balls and head out to the line with all the other duffers.  You bang your bucket of balls out on the range, trying your best to hit the kid in the cart collecting the balls.  You never really know where your ball went, watching the 50 balls flying out there at the same time could get confusing.  Driving range, meet the 21st century.  It's all computerized.  There are actual targets that score your shots for you.  There's a bar.  There is food.  You are in the shade and on either side of you is a flat-panel playing whatever game is on at the moment.  Can practicing get any better?  You purchase a membership card that allows you to register when you play and track your shots.  There are clubs for all sorts of shots, men, women, left or right available.  Food/drink servers coming by with a menu.  You pay by the hour and as long as you keep swinging, the computer-machine keeps spitting out balls and tracking your performance for you.  Don't worry about it.  Get thirsty? Full drink menu.  Hungry?  Great appetizers.  I tried the Chicken wings three ways, BBQ, Buffalo and Asian Sesame.  Comes with dipping sauce and veggies.  Wings were crispy and tasty.  Next, we had the Chips with Guac and Nacho Cheese Sauce.  Chips were out of a bag, but they kept us supplied.  The Nacho sauce was okay, the Guac was fresh and delicious, the salsa plain and boring.  We golfed for a couple of hours and had a blast.  The building is three levels, all brick and glass, there are free video games if you are waiting for a spot,  and the restrooms are clean.  I'm not a golfer, but I would say Topgolf rocks.",

Even though it was incredibly fun, the reason I give it 5 stars though is the obvious effort to offer great service.    We went on a Friday and had no problem getting a bay. We were met outside by some nice Topgolf employees.  Once inside, employees quickly checked us in and escorted our group to our bay.  For an hour it averages about $11 person.  Food and drink prices I thought were reasonable.      I also want to give huge kudos to our server - she checked back frequently and was super friendly.  Recommendations:  Get your $5 membership online.  This will save you a little time inside.  Leave your sticks unless you're so tall or short that average size clubs won't do it for you. Our group of 4 did fine with the selection of clubs they had at the bay.        'Sunday Funday' offers significant discounts.     We'll be back - What a great place!",

This is putt putt for grown ups but better!(and a lot more difficult)  Every player has to purchase a player card, then you can choose to buy bay time in one or split it evenly among the player cards. Each bay has a set of men's clubs and women's clubs, with pretty decent variety (driver, 3 wood, hybrid 3 wood, a couple irons, wedge). The computer system is very easy to navigate, just tap on your name and step up to take how ever many shots you want for each turn! We were on the second level, which definitely helped a few of our causes on achieving distance in one round of play.  The only reason this review isn't a 5 is because the waiter service was a tad slow at times and we were there later in the night until closing, they weren't that busy. But great selection of mixed drinks/beer(bucket deals)/wines. I can't wait for the location to open in Ohio!",

It's a beautiful complex and very modern.  We went on a Saturday night so it was pretty crowded.  We only had to wait 30 minutes for our own golfing bay which wasn't bad.  We grabbed a drink in the super cool modern bar and before we knew it, it was our turn to golf.    The golfing is fun - it's basically just a driving range turned into a competition much like darts or bowling.  Great place for groups or parties!   The food was actually above average for a bar!  I was impressed with the sliders and quesadilla.  The drinks were great!  Go for the frozen margs with a sangria float :)   Next time I go back it's going to be for sunday funday because they have awesome deals on Sundays and why not?",

We ended up waiting about 90 minutes on a Friday afternoon in the middle of spring training - had plenty of drinks and food at the bar.  Basically Top Golf is golf's version of bowling.  You get a couch, a waitress and a TV.  Then you can play a variety of games with your friends ... there are computer chips in each ball so the system knows where your shot goes.  You can make it as serious or non-serious as you'd like.  The scoring itself is a bit gimmicky - if you make one shot, the next is worth double etc.  Sometimes the chips in the balls don't register your score even though the shots go in a net (happened at least 6 times in 2 hours for us)  - We had a bay on the 3rd floor, and from that high up, even if you shank a shot, it usually manages to roll in to some kind of net for points.  So, if you're a terrible golfer, go higher up!  All in all, we had a good time.  If you are in a casual group and have inexperienced golfers, then this place is great.  If you are a hard-core golfer, then it's probably better to just go out an play one of the dozens of courses in the area.",

We were on the \"main\" floor and the view was gorgeous! The concept of a bar with golf and food is so unique. I loved the food btw! We got a mix of everything but the steak flat bread I had was perfect!   The game itself was okay but I mainly liked the atmosphere. I'm not a big golf fan. I really dont know if I would return to play, but to join friends again, definitely. The only problem I had was that we felt very rushed. We were rushed to start the games. We were rushed to pay for the games right away. We were rushed out of the tables after closing out. I don't remember the manager's name, she was being polite, but every time I moved I felt she was right there ready to scurry us out. Our server was amazing though! She went by just \"Tay.\" Ive never had a server that I felt was like a part of the party. She was so easy going, which I enjoyed as well.  All in all I'd say you should experience Top Golf at least once, but it won't be my go to. I was told they have games for free there also, but didn't really look into it.",

I had a really hard time following my ball so I with the monitors tracked the golf ball while in flight and not just if it hits the target. Now, we only played the topgolf game for a few fours so other games might do that. The food was fantastic, I had the chicken quesadilla and it was probably the best quesadilla I've had so hats of to the chef, we also had a chicken cob salad which looked good as well as chips and salsa. Maybe just a little pricey, between the quesadilla, chicken cob salad, chips and salsa, 2 beers and a sangria it was almost $70. Now let's talk about service, meh, it took about 10 min just to get water, then about 20 more minutes before we saw our waiter again to order lunch and drinks. The food didn't take to long to come out. I just think that our waiter could have checked on us more often than he did. We would have spent more money with drinks but we never had the chance to reorder. It's definitely a entertaining place, just a little disappointed in the table service. The service counter people that greet you were friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "Brought a group of 8 people to top golf tonight for the \"zombie ball.\" Showed up at 10:30 dressed to the tee. We were cut off before we got to the bar because someone said \"I'm stone sober right now.\" The only thing worse than the price of golf balls is the management of this establishment. I've never felt more disrespected. I will never be back and will discourage all of my friends from going.",

    "text": "AMAZING! We took our kids over the weekend.  One of our children has a life threating nut allergy. When we were ready to order we asked the waitress if they used peanut oil and she said she would check to see. Not only did she check , the chef came over to our table personally and told us what was safe for him to eat. AMAZING service what a great 1st impression!  If you have kids and they are not really into golf as much as the parents request the 1st floor area so you can be near the game room. The kids could play inside and the adults can hang outside.",

    "text": "The food here is great and the service is pretty good too, but I wouldn't recommend this place because of the safety issue.  I've seen people swinging their golf clubs outside of the red zone.  And of course, sometimes there are more than 1 person in the red zone when one of them is hitting the ball while the other person was chatting.  Any golfer would know that having two people in the red zone is very dangerous and would be very cautious about it.  But this is not a place for just regular golfers.  It's for families or friends to get together whether they golf or not.  However, I did not see any of them got warned for doing what they were doing.  Again, great idea, bad management here.  Also, there was a golfer chasing his golf ball from his red zone to our red zone when one of my friends was about to take a swing.  Again, no staff tried to stop that or approach the ball-chaser and explain the safety rules.  Did any of the staff saw that?  Of course.  But it's probably not waitress's responsibility to report this issue as long as no blood spilled?  There is a good chance that I will get a feedback stating \"we will immediately address your concern\" but I doubt it will really be seriously addressed until a major accident takes place and gets on the news. So for the time being, I would avoid this place so I am not the one ending up on the news.",
