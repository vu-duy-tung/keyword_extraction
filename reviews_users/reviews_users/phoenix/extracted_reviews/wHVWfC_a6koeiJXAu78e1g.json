I am a fan of Joe's in Gilbert so I was skeptical I would like Rudy's as much but I was surprised at how good it was.    The ambiance is really cute.  It is cafeteria style and they will let you sample the meats to help with your decision which is a nice touch.  I got the smoked turkey and it was very tasty.  I would have liked to see some more sides offered.  That was the only thing I thought Joes was better in.  The service was very good, the restaurant is very clean and the food is good.  There are lots of sauce options offered at the table.  I can't wait to try some more meats here!",

Make this place popular, guys. They'll even give you samples - what's there to lose?  And if I may, get creamed corn because I actually drove from California to get this today, Arizonians. Jealous!  They also sell plenty of Shiner Bock and Blue Bell ice cream here. I'll be back!",

Environment is awesome!  True southwest place. Really cool. But the food was so-so. They start you with samples which is good. I went with my safe bet, brisket and pulled pork. They have a dry tough lean brisket and a moist fatty brisket. The mounts was my choice. It's just ok. Really not great. Some brisket you eat with no sauce it's so darn good. Not here. Gotta soak it in for flavor.  The pulled pork is pre-seasoned and really wet. Paying for the wet here on the weight for sure. Had to soak that in sauce too. Now, the sauce is good, darn good too or I'd be stuck. So overall great place, 3 stars or less on the food.",

I opted for the \"moist\" brisket and It was some of the best brisket I've enjoyed. Sauce selections on the picnic-style tables made adding the quality of sauce - or no sauce - totally up to me. Nice friendly service was also a plus. The only down side is that they, like most bbq places, do not serve green salads or low-card sides.",

From the samples to my actual entree, the sides and the dessert (banana pudding), everything just fell kinda flat for me.  But what Rudy's lacks in flavor, they make up for in ambience.  The inside of the restaurant is really cute and cheery.  I felt like I was in a barbecue joint in the middle of Texas.  I like the self-serve aspect of the restaurant (the only thing they do for you is get your your meat and ring you up).  The staff is very friendly and helpful, so that's always a plus.  And if you're looking for a cute, fun place to bring the family or a group of coworkers, I would recommend Rudy's.",

Either way, it's amazing. Throw some of their yummy pickles on top (from the toppings bar) and your set!  Most amazing potato salad I have had! Sadly the beans were not my favorite.

As soon as I got home I was beyond sick. I had gotten food poisoning. I was upset about it because I typically love Rudy's food and the service and have never experienced this. Unfortunately I will not be returning back.. Having to miss work and stay at home feeling awful is not worth it.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to try Rudy's BBQ on May day.  I worried about long lines but that didn't happen at 5pm on a Tuesday.  I figured they had a month to get their staff working efficiently.  We were greeted at the door and given small printed menus as they explained that the meats were sold by the half pound, there were cold sides in a large refrigerator case, drinks on a huge ice filled table and an order counter.  They place your order in a wax paper lined plastic basket, approximately 12\" by 18\" with 5\" sides. We took a medium sized (pint) potato salad (3.69) and a small pudding (2.49) from the refrigerator case, and 2 bottles of IFC root beer (3.38) off the iced table and proceeded to the counter with the digital scale.  Ordered pulled pork and was charged for 0.58 lb of it at 5.79, don't know why they can't measure it out to the half pound listed at 4.99 they advertise. Also ordered beef brisket, the moist which is a bit more fatty but I heard the extra lean was too dry. They put over 3/4 of a pound on the scale and the girl asked if I wanted some taken off, which she did leaving 0.69 lb (8.96) The meats were great, moist, delicious, well smoked, some of the best BBQ we've had. Also ordered some hot sides, new potatoes small 1.99 (boiled or steamed peeled potatoes, chunked and floating in butter.  Nothing special, little flavor, needed lots of salt and pepper, won't order it again.  Sweet cream corn small 2.19 was overly sweet, needed lots of salt to counteract the sugar, won't order again.  The potato salad was fairly good, I'd order that again as it goes well with the meats.  My wife said the pudding (banana) was \"kinda bland and I wouldn't order it again\".  Total with tax was $31.00 A bit overpriced I think,  They threw in 8 slices of white and wheat bread to make sandwiches with, the bread was very fresh.  There were 2 kinds of BBQ sauce on the table, tomato/vinegar based, on mild, one slightly spicy, they were OK, not great. You could buy a 32 0z bottle for 8.50 if you desired.  Other than the quality and taste of the meats, nothing else stood out.  There are long wooden tables that could become uncomfortably crowded if they are very busy.  I think I might return to buy their meat and take it home, the brisket at 12.98 a lb and the pulled pork at 9.98 a lb.  I give them 4 stars because of how good the meats are. There were pickles, peppers and sweet onion slices available for the taking.",

I'll pay the premium.  Prime Rib is offered only Fri-Sun.  The brisket is either really good, or not.  The brisket at Can't Stop Smoking is always good.  The pulled pork here is phenomenal!    The sides here are better than at Can't Stop Smokin, in my opinion.    One of the overlooked menu items is the Jumbo Baked Potato.  I usually get one loaded with meat.  Talk about a meal!!  Guaranteed to stuff you for the night.   The bbq sauces are a bit tame.  I still love Famous Dave's 'Devils Spit.'    All in all, a very good place to eat, and it is no frills.  You don't have a waiter, but you might have to wait.  Usually a line at the place, even almost 4 months after they opened.    So you know it's good.",

    "text": "Okay...so I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and had unlimited access to Rudy's. Loved their brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact they market themselves as the \"worst BBQ\". I moved to Phx for 4 years then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes we have Rudy's but they're not nearly as accessible as they are in ATX. So I think Ive been once in 2 years. Went for a wkd trip to Phx at the end of July and low and behold what do e drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend had never been so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately my friend wasn't a fan of the sauce.. too peppery for her liking. I loved every second..not so much the brisket/egg taco but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. OMFG! Delish! Well now Im moving back to CT so Im sure Rudy's is in my pat but Im glad I got one last taste. Ill miss you.",

Needless to say, I had to try it! Once I got inside, I was a little surprised... It was almost like a fast food kind of restaurant. You walk up to the counter to order and the seating is all bench styled open seating. Not super ideal but kind of open and friendly at the same time.  I'm not super big on spicy things and it turns out that even the least spicy thing there was, ultimately, too spicy for me... including the baked beans. But it was still pretty tasty. There was no real option to get any kind of veggie unless you wanted some okra or something random like that.   Not my favorite place, but neat for something new and different.",

    "text": "I want to give them 3.5 but now way to do that. Rudy's is a fun place to go, and as bbq joints go in AZ it is ok.   I have been twice now.  One time the line was out the door and took 35 minutes to get to the counter.  No drink service or anyone walking the line while we were waiting in that long line which surprised. me.   First time there I got Coleslaw, the loaded potato with meat, and pork ribs.  I think the potato is the best deal in the place, it comes loaded with almost a full order of meat for the same price as an order of meat.  I had the briscuit, which was very very good.   As I have found from most bbq joints here, the coleslaw was bland, and the ribs were ok, a little overcooked.  Second time I went I had baby backs and jalapeno sausage.  Sausage was spicy and good, I am a sucker for a sausage, .  Babybacks were ok, they were pulled out of the smoker a little soon, and not falling off the bone tender.  I did have a couple of ribs on the end that got a little more heat and were decent..  it seems they do not use much spice on the ribs either and were a little bland.  Rudy's staff is friendly and the place is clean.  Because it is so new, it is not a place for a fast meal, but give it time.  It will slow down and you can drop in for a sandwich with out a 30 minute wait to order.   Try the Briscuit and the pulled pork, I think the best things on the menu.    Great place for the family to go and eat.  Have a good time.",

Had the cole slaw and beans which were very good.  and don't forget the bread to make a BBQ sandwich with.  Only nit is that they don't have diet DP which I think is against the law in TX.",

After looking over the menu, I quickly decided I was only going to purchase the smoke meat products and make my own sides. Sides add up $$. The cashier was extremely helpful in telling me how much I should order for my party of 4. I ordered 3 lbs. of Pulled Pork, 1 lbs. Baby Back Ribs, 1/2 lbs. Moist Brisket. She had also given me a generous amount of sauce. I also loved all the goodies at the side bar, hot Cherry Peppers, Jalapenos, Onions, Pickles, Bread, forks knifes and extra sauces etc. They even supply little baggies to put them in to take out. So my bill for just that amount of meat was $44.00. Now Everyone knows meat is heavy so price per pound amount is not cheap.  I will say it was pretty good, could be a little more smokier tasting though. With all the BBQ places in town there is a lot of competition. Would I go back? Yes to do take meat if I was in a pinch for that smoky flavor that they need to kick-up a bit.",

I have noticed they have become somewhat of a nationwide chain but continue to deliver a predictable product, albeit at an elevated price....lately I've stepped away from the brisket and gravitated towards ribs and pulled pork. The Pork spare ribs are a current fav.... I always skip the bread and grab a pile of pickled veggies instead. Their original sause is very good...I've never tried the sissy sause, must be sweet or lacking pepper I suspect. Anyway, expect to spend about $15-$20 and feel stuffed. One thing to note is they sell by the pound but the menu shows 1/2Lb choices....you can alter these to 1/4 or whatever you want....remember 1Lb of meat with sides is quite filling....now get your 'Que on!",

The bf kept telling me not to expect too much so expectations were low, but we ordered a half pound of moist brisket and a half pound of turkey to share. We also got some complimentary wheat and white bread slices. They also have a station where you can fill up on onions, jalapenos, cherry peppers, pickles, etc. I always like to have a contrasting crunchy vegetable when I'm eating meat so it's nice that I'm not forced to order a side. Although I will admit I wish I had ordered the creamed corn since our friends did and it was DELICIOUS. I felt no guilt getting two helpings of this from them. (I'm a sucker for corn).   They have a few different sauces at the tables which include BBQ sauce and hot sauce. I looooved the combo of a piece of brisket dipped in BBQ sauce/hot sauce, piece of bread, pickled veggies, and a bite of creamed corn. I was glad we didn't order too much since I definitely would not have stopped eating.   At the time we went it wasn't too packed and if you've never been there before (just me) they tell you how ordering works. You get your order in a big plastic bin lined with parchment paper. At the station with the veggies you can also pick up napkins and rip off parchment paper to cover your table with. Overall would recommend if you're in the mood for BBQ in this area!",

When we called to ask them about it, they said that they were really busy and just forgot to give them to us.  They said they would drive them over, but by the time they arrived the party was over.  I would be careful using Rudy's if you are planning an important event.  Based upon our experience they seem disorganized and have difficulty with the basics when they feel they are busy.",

Good ol' Texas style BBQ. I can dig it. If you've never been to Rudy's, then damn boy, you're missing out. They have an assortment of beverages (and alcohol!) to choose from.   Brisket and sides galore and pools of sauces. Pig out and enjoy yourself. This is the best BBQ West of the Mississippi. Hell, it may be better than most of the BBQ East of the Mississippi too.",

Different type of ordering & service with the pick and choose drinks, cold sides, then up to the counter where they give you the hot sides and slice the meat. Prices were fairly standard for BBQ dinner. Brisket was a little too fatty for me and did not like the BBQ sauces. Meat did have a good flavor and was very tender. Beans were very good - would like to see a wider selection of sides including okra. I've had better BBQ brisket and would rate this as only average.",

We ordered the lean brisket, baby back ribs, potato salad, beans, sweet tea and peach cobbler. Unfortunately our experience was quite contrary to the wonderful  \"word of mouth\" recommendations.  Our hot food was cold and flavor less. No salt or pepper on any of the meats. The sides tasted unauthentic. The cobbler was just \"okay\".  We did not enjoy our lunch on that day and most likely will not return.  The best thing from eating here was the gentlemen who greeted us & informed us how to order our food. Sorry, but from our negative experience we can't recommend Rudy's BBQ Chandler location.",

    "text": "I'm very familiar with Rudy's, as it was a staple BBQ spot in NM (where in originally from). Just as it was back home, Rudy's continues to offer delicious BBQ at a great price.   I'm a sucker for their brisket (usually dealer's choice between moist, a bit fattier, and lean, less fat), and the jalapeno sausage. The brisket is never dry and seasoned/smoked to perfection, and the sausage has just the right amount of spiciness. They also have ribs and pulled pork, plus the chicken is also fantastic, if red meat isn't your thing.   Sides like the potato salad and cream corn are wonderful compliments to your meal, but go with the jumbo baked potato if you're feeling famished - it's fit for a giant. You can even add any meat if your choice and make a meal of it on its own.   Rudy's offers ample indoor and outdoor (enclosed patio) seating, and is a great breakfast/lunch/dinner spot for your whole family. Wait..breakfast you say?? Yea, Rudy's also has breakfast tacos that are AMAZING! In case you miss out on getting them in the AM, sometimes you get lucky and they still have a few when you go for lunch. #Winning",

This location, just south of Phoenix, is pretty much identical to their Texas locations, except no gas station, LOL.  You can buy all your favorite meats here, by weight, and the service is great.   Get there before 10 AM and they have breakfast tacos ready to grab and go at the counter. The brisket ones are my favorite.   For a more standard meal, order you meat, grab your side dishes, and head over to their condiment bar after you pay and grab as much bread, sauce and pickles to your stomach's delight.  They've also opened another location just of 10-West near Litchfield.  Great place to grab a quick, yummy meal before or after hitting up a Cactus League baseball game.",

There's often a line when you go in, but use the time to get familiar with the menu. You can order half pound portions of meat, pick up sides in the fridge by the counter, and grab a beer or other bottled beverage (soda, water, etc.) while standing in line.  Personally, I like getting a brisket sandwich. I usually skip sides since they're just OK and the brisket is more than enough to fill me up. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. The brisket isn't too fatty, the buns are fresh, and the smoky flavor of delicious goodness is awesome.  I like picking up jalapenos and onions before pouring BBQ sauce over my sandwich. If you don't like spicy BBQ sauce, use the sissy version. Regular has a nice little kick if that's what you're into.  Overall, super good. Give Rudy's a go!",

One of the employees was kind enough to explain how the process works. Everything is individually bought drinks, sides, main dish etc.  For people who never been their before or whoever, they offer free samples of each of their meats which I thought was pretty cool. All their meats are  either bought per pound or as a sandwich. We ended up ordering a side of potato salad which was great and my mom and I both ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  The pork was very tender, actually all the samples were great. I would come back next time I am in AZ.",

Third time was not the charm as I got nasty dry, flavorless brisket. As I continue to crave BBQ I do stop in here from time to time. Definitely hit or miss. Sometime this brisket is awesome, but 7 times out of 10 it's just ok. I honestly really don't like the BBQ sauce either.I don't know why but it's getting worse and worse And the value is lacking cause BBQ is is usually pricey when it's top notch. It's a bbq chain, I'll stay away and go other bbq places like Texas smoke house bbq and little miss bbq. Porkopolis Is great too.",

I am not the BBQ eater where I use a lot of sauce as it then covers up the fakir of the meat. Doing so would be Ike why even bother taking the time to slow smoke the meat in the first place. I actually choked on this it was like leather. It alone was way over salted for my taste.   Even if I was able to return this meat it should never made it to my plate like that. That plate is a signature dish and should never be prepared and served like this in my opinion.   Great atmospheric and comfortable environment. Wish there was a manager on duty that asked me how the food was. Just a bunch of kids last Saturday at 5PM.   If I could I would have given this 0 stars as my sandwich and coleslaw and water was over $10 and was near inedible.   Lots of BBQ choices one right next door!   You guys need to get your quality control in order and make sure your manager is more proactive with the customers!!!!!",

The Chandler location does a great job of upholding the Texas tradition.  My favorites are the moist brisket and regular sausage.  Both very tasty.  Rudy's is a pretty large place but because the food is so good the lines get pretty long during lunch or dinner so come early.  They cut up the meat at the counter to your order and wrap it to go or serve it on butcher paper.  Certainly one of the best BBQ stops in Phoenix.",

Moist Brisket, sliced, on a piece of white bread, topped with sissy sause and jalapenos and pickles. Is there anything better? I say Nay! Not that there isn't any other good bbq places in town, there are plenty, but, this is a pulled pork city. And, I am a sliced brisket man.  One knock on Rudys is that you have to eat-in, the taste and texture of the meat changes dramatically when travelling, even a short distance. Had Rudys for an event at work and it wasn't quite the same, good, but not great like when you eat at the store.  Still.....there is no denying that when it comes to barbecue, Rudys is the one for me. Oh yeah, and the banana pudding with the nilla cookies, oh yeah!",

I couldn't get past a second bite. Just not the traditional type. Now, maybe that's part of the draw for most folks, but we sure didn't like the tangy sauce at all. Place was packed though, so clearly we're an exception. Maybe because we're used to the real stuff in Texas and Oklahoma. We have no idea how this place was popular in Texas. But, the place is just adorable and the staff is just wonderful. Liked the long picnic table style seating and it's nice that they have a separate area with smaller families. Great for large groups as long as they like the food. The turkey was pretty good as long as I didn't use any sauce. Probably won't be back. FYI, the bbq place next door is the Applebee's of bbq and a one star place... Unless you love Applebee's... :-)",

You still have to stand in line and serve yourself and I preferred to sit down and be waited on if I'm going to spend $32 for dinner. The sauce is OK but I did have the regular pork ribs once instead of the baby back's and they were undercooked and tough. They need some more time to let those slow cook so that they fall off the bone properly and so that you don't have to tear them with your teeth so hard. The baby backs are excellent and the prime rib is excellent when you can get it. Other than that no problems with the place at all. As I mentioned the staff is friendly and very willing to accommodate you. If you take the food out it's a little bit messy unless they give you a shopping bag because you'll have to visit the condiments bar and and everything has to go in a plastic bag he which doesn't really tote",

    "text": "Excellent BBQ, but only if you go during lunch. Food is much fresher at lunch and I've been served some freshly cut, steaming hot Brisket and Baby back ribs to die for. The fall off the bone goodness basically didn't even need any sauce it was that good.   However, I've also come during dinner where quality fluctuates greatly. I've been served decent BBQ at best and dry BBQ at the worst. Even the baby back ribs at night have been much tougher/drier and turkey has lacked moisture almost to the point of feeling like eating hydrated jerky or something.  Overall, it's a great lunch joint, when food turnover is high and they're cranking out fresh food constantly. Dinner, I'd personally avoid.   I've had most of their menu so far and I can recommend the following especially during lunch: Brisket Lean Turkey Hot Links (Jalapeno, if you can handle actual spicy. If Tabasco is too much for you, don't bother trying) Baby Back Ribs Green Chile Stew  Haven't tried their prime rib yet among some other stuff, but I've almost had everything else. I'm not a big fan of their refrigerated stuff like coleslaw as they have a bunch of styrofoam cups prefilled with food and based on what I've tried it isn't very fresh to me.  Sauces wise they have their standard and a Sissy sauce. Both taste really similar to me and neither of them are very spicy, just more of the standard sweet BBQ sauce.",

Thankfully, the cashier was nice and offered us samples. I usually go for brisket at a BBQ place, but I thought Rudy's was a bit dry and lacking flavor. I'm not sure which one we tried; you can order the brisket three different ways depending on how lean you want your cut. The pulled pork and the turkey were really good, juicy and full of flavor. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Meat came on a standard hamburger bun; it would be nice if it was toasted, but it didn't look like mine was.  With all the sides being a la carte, meals add up quickly. I didn't try any sides, but my family members did. You have to grab your silverware, drinks, and condiments. I thought the Rudy's \"sause\" (not sure why they spell it as such) was good, but they had a wimpy version with less heat, which I didn't find necessary, because the regular didn't seem spicy. I thought my sandwich was decent, but none of my family members raved about their food. You also have to clean up after yourself, which is fine, but I guess I wasn't expecting that. It's more of a fast food place, I suppose. It was good for a quick dinner, and we were hungry. If we had time, we would've gone to Bobby Q, because that place is excellent.",

Soooooo good, but get the sour cream on the side (butter, too, if that's your thing) to keep the wonderful smoked beef flavor from being overwhelmed.

The brisket was salty and the coleslaw, pickles, and creamed corn blah. However, the big sin was the prime rib. First it was presented so raw that the server commented that it wasn't properly cooked. I agreed, expecting that she would get another serving. Nope! Thowing barbeque or any prime rib on the grill to heat or worse cook it more destroys both texture and flavor. So, my advice, go elsewhere. Making that easy in this case is having a barbeque place next door. To be honest, I'd probably also prefer the Dennys on the other side.",

Siblings had the peach cobbler and potato salad, also delicious! The sweet tea was delicious. It you definitely want to have water or soda water with your meal.   We were disappointed with the barbecue sauce though. It was more acidic that molassesy. So if you like sweet baby rays you may not like this BBQ sauce. The hot sauce options at the table were also lacking.   I have 4 stars, because the food was delicious. The condiments could be better, barbecue is only as good as its sauce in my opinion.",

Sides include creamed corn, beans, coleslaw, and peach cobbler for dessert.  Texas style bar b q.  A nice sauce is available on be tables, and a \"sissy\" sauce is readily available if you don't lean toward spicy.  My favorite is the jalapeno sausage.",

Meats are served deli style and 1/2 pound portions are plenty filling, they also have BBQ sandwiches either way you can't go wrong. I ordered the moist brisket and jalapeno link, brisket was very moist full of flavor and down right delicious! Link was good, could have used a bit more spice. Atmosphere is really cool, has a family feel to it with large picnic type tables and a few small one as well. Ate my food so fast that I didn't take any pics, well guess that means I'll need to go back so I can update my review!!! OK it's just my excuse to go back to eat some more of their delicious BBQ!!!! Keep up the GOOD-WORK RUDYS!",

We always get a Rudy's Turkey breast for Thanksgiving and Christmas and other family events, but we never tried a Ham. Because HoneyBaked is so expensive, I thought I'd try Rudy's. I was a little worried because Rudy's is not known for ham. But what's the worst that could happen? Rudy's throws a spiral-cut ham from the local grocery store in the smoker? Holy moly, it was amazing! Everyone loved it and said it was even better than HoneyBaked Ham. That's saying something. And I don't know if it was a Rudy's ham or bought from a grocery store, but it was wonderful, not a lot of fat, and delicious!",

    "text": "We love good barbecue.  After living in Texas for many years and then being able to travel back for some of the great barbecue Texas is known for, we love to sample Texas BBQ restaurants located elsewhere.    We noticed two fairly new barbecue restaurants across the street from each other on Chandler Blvd.  Now what's that all about?  Who would build a restaurant next to a competitor?  Well, evidently  Rudy's BBQ  and Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ did.  I wonder who was first??  It was an eeny, meeny, miny, moe picking which one to go to.  We ended up going to Rudy's.  I read the reviews.  I know lots of folks love Rudy's.  After our first trip there, I've got to say that we couldn't understand why. However, the brisket was very good and tender so it really does deserve the three stars but I've had better.   If I were just comparing Rudy's to the other barbecue restaurants we have eaten at, it would be at the bottom of the list.    The rating is for the restaurant and the experience as a whole which drags it down to a two star.  Everything you order is ala carte.  If you order meat, you get only meat.  We didn't like the barbecue sauce and we didn't care for the spicy beans.  I was raised on pinto beans and cornbread.  I didn't expect spicy beans.  I wish we had tried the cream corn but only read about it when I got ready to write this review.  One more thing I didn't care about was the way the food was served.  It was served in a crate like tray with an edge all around.  Eating it was awkward but it kept the table clean.  Actually, that was a good thing because there are several signs around the restaurant telling you that your mother doesn't work there so pick up after yourself.  Now I know we all do that at fast food restaurants but at a barbecue place?  Nope.  We won't be going back.  Next time we're in the area we'll go across the street and try out the Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ restaurant.  I did walk through it and it definitely looks a \"cut\" above Rudy's .... but the review has to wait for the taste test.  In the meantime if we're in the mood for good barbecue we'll probably make a trip over to Gilbert for the fabulous Joe's BBQ or even a stop at Famous Dave's.",

I wasn't too hungry and they let you order 1/2 pounds of meat which was great. When I walked in, it had a very Texas vibe with benches for seating and self serve condiments/water/etc. They also had a plethora of bottled sodas that you can purchase for $1.99 each.   I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket and 1/2 lb of baby back ribs. The brisket was delicious. It was my first time eating it, but it was very well cooked and the meat was so tender that it melts in your mouth. I'm used to meat being really well marinated, so I felt like the meat was pretty bland. There was bbq sauce on the tables that people used for the meat and it was really good. It gave the meat a perfect spicy kick that wasn't too crazy. The baby back ribs weren't too good. I could say that I've had way better. The meat didn't come off the bones like some of the baby back ribs that I've had. The meat wasn't too tender and was pretty chewy. I also thought it lacked some flavor.   I would say the brisket is the definite thing to get here. It was very reasonably priced and super delicious.",

This only traps you into ordering everything on the menu. Order by weight here...the least amount I believe is 1/4 lbs. that's enough to leave you wanting more, but leaves you room to try different items. It's cut fresh when you order and in the smoker until your ready. There is no wait staff it's cafeteria style dinning. I would recommend the green chili stew, moist brisket, and cream corn. They serve a breakfast burrito but I haven't been  able to get there in the morning. One day ...",

    "text": "OK, time to update my review because this place has grown on me. I still wish that they would use plates (even paper plates would do) instead of doing the whole butcher paper thing just because they are trying to be cute. Regardless, they have some pretty tasty barbeque and a decent beer selection. They are so close to our house my husband and I stop by every once in a while and have not been disappointed with the food (even though I do still prefer Andrew's). My favorite is the lean brisket with their spicy bbq sauce. I really wish they had cornbread but their baby potatoes make a pretty good side dish.  Last summer my hubby's nephew held his graduation dinner here. I was wishing that he would have chosen someplace a little nicer but it actually worked out great because everyone could order what they wanted without fights over the check at the end of the night. The manager reserved the private room for us even though we were only a group of about 25 so we could have easily sat in the main restaurant. But it was nice to have the privacy. They even let us bring in an ice cream cake and kept it in the freezer for us until after the meal. Everyone who works here is pretty friendly but the service that night was above and beyond so I had to give them 4 stars for that.",

To me, you judge a good BBQ place by their brisket and this place holds it's own. If brisket is not smoked long enough it just tastes like crappy pot roast. That is unfortunately the case with most places in the valley. The only other place I can recommend around here is Texas BBQ House in Phoenix although once Rudy's moved in, even though Rudy's is a chain I have to say they are still slightly better. The Green Chile Stew is really great tasting. As is the turkey and Jalapeno sausage. Overall, if you are looking for good BBQ in the valley this is the best you are going to find.",

The baby backs were tender and had good flavor but BBQ sauce is horrible. The corn on the cob was a soggy mess, it had to have been sitting in water for hours. The beans had decent flavor but I ordered a medium serving and got 95% juice with a extremely small portion of beans. The pulled pork was below average, and since the sauce is so poor, it couldn't help the pork. The peach cobbler was disgusting, it had a undercooked gooey dough crust!!!! Overall it is much too pricey for the quality of food. Save your money and make the trip to Mesa and hit up Waldos. Or if you want a chain BBQ place, Famous Dave's is a much better choice.",

You sat outdoors next to the fire and usually smelled like wood smoke when you left. Soon there were lines out the open-air counter and ranch hands and dentists stood in line with all the other lovers of fine Texas BarBQ. I thought I had died and gone to heaven when Steve Freidkin, owner of TexAz Grill told me (at the Robert Earl Keen concert) Phoenix had a Rudy's. I was in line the next day for lunch! Almost everything felt like home and many others thought so too. The line snaked thru the restaurant and out the door. Just like home. I give it a 99%, the only concern was that the brisket tasted like it had been cooked in a new pit--WHICH IT HAD!  Takes time to season the pit with lots of good wood and smoke from the meat to produce the right flavor. But, its pretty dang close!  Closest thing to authentic anywhere in AZ.",

    "text": "My husband and I meet at Rudy's often for lunch since it is right by his work.  I always order the potato with meat on it and my husband usually orders the small sandwich.  We have tried most of the meats but the pork and turkey are our favorites!! We have always been disappointed with the sides here.  They are bland and really not that great.  When you have places like Joes Real BBQ that have phenomenal sides I guess you kind of expect that.  I would love to see some new sides in the future.  Their BBQ sauce on the other hand is delicious!! We actually buy the big bottle to have at our house :) ... You can't go wrong with eating at Rudy's!!",

Rudy's is where I go whenever I travel to Texas. Rudy's is what all other bbq places try to achieve when it comes to brisket.  Yes, you should always, always, always get the brisket...ahhh-mazing!  Went here on day two and everything was perfect...I got there right when it opened and was still about the 50th person thru the line. Felt kinda bad for the 100+ people in line when I left...at least it isn't 115 outside yet for those last 40 or so that were in the line wrapped around outside.  AZ is going to love Rudy's...wish I had the money to open my own.",

    "text": "Loved It! Went on a slow afternoon when the crowd had disappeared. I stepped to the counter and the little girl behind it basically took me to school on bbq and all of their sides. Before getting a chance to order she was plying me with spoonfuls of cream corn (amazing) and their vege chili  (out of this world). She had the slicers carve me pieces from their smoked turkey breast, two kinds of brisket, pulled pork, and smoked sausage. After swallowing I decided to take home a half pound of the lean brisket, some pulled pork, a couple of sausages, and a bunch of sides. Everything was great. The only knock I have is the bbq sauce is only so-so. Fortunately all of the meat was so succulent and well seasoned that the sauce became an afterthought.  Also, the meat is sold by the pound not by the plate, so you get exactly what you pay for.",

Since it opened only a few weeks ago, I have visited twice but my husband is there almost daily. It is that good. This is a BBQ joint. Most Rudy's in Texas are attached to a gas station - this one is not. So this isn't a fancy restaurant - but who wants that for BBQ. You order at the counter, get your food served on butcher paper and get as many slices of white or wheat bread as you desire. The brisket melts in your mouth, get the cutters choice. Moist, delicious, heaven. You can order by the slice or pound increaments - such as 1/4lb etc. The pulled pork and ribs are also amazing. The sides could be a meal by themselves - the creamed corn - SCRUMPTOUS! Cole slaw - fabulous and potato salad - AWESOME. The only side I am not a big fan of are the beans - just don't personally like ranch beans. There are also puddings available for desert but i am always too full to try them.  Since anyone who has ever visited the great state of Texas is now lining up to get their BBQ fix there is a line, but it moves fast and is absolutely worth the wait.",

No plates, not your typical Az BBQ restaurant.  LOVED the entire experience.  And that's what it was!  Great brisket, great turkey, coleslaw and Rudy's beans!!  Man the White Mountains needs a Rudy's!  We have so few restaurants that I even want to eat at twice.  This place was incredible, from the decor, the ordering experience where smoked and Bbq'd meat is sold by the (1/2) pound, to the \"no plate\" atmosphere, to the wash basin in the hallway where you can wash up...I totally enjoyed my Rudy's experience and have told 3 people about it and it hasn't even been 24 hours since I ate there!  A must try in Chandler.  Feel sorry for the \"other\" place next door.  No competition....Try Rudy's...you won't be sorry!",

So for all the yelpers that are whining about the sauce, please go to Kansas City where they cover up their BBQ in sauce. Do not eat here this place is not for you.

THe nice thng is they don't need to smother their meat in sauce like other places.  They have a great sauce, but the bbq stands on its own.  The sides are awesome as well..........and the best part is you can eat with your hands!  They provide rolls of butcher paper and we love to toss the food on the table and go to town!  My 8tr. old daughter loves the brisket as well and her favorite quote is:  You gotta have the fat 'cause if you cut the fat, you fill the flavor!",

Had the beef brisket sandwich with a baked potato and neither one disappointed. The Potato was HUGE, and very freshly cooked!

After a quick car ride and nearly an hour-wait standing in line, we had ourselves some delicious BBQ!  The line during dinner time is ridiculously crazy but it moved at a pretty fast pace.  Long dining tables and plenty of seats made the fear of having to stand and eat non-existent.  I ordered 1/2lb of moist brisket with a potato salad side and banana pudding for dessert.  Yum!  That brisket was pure fatty goodness and I probably should've ordered it lean but hey.  No regrets!  Barbequed meat done right doesn't need sauce but I found myself making a tiny brisket sandwich with the bread and some BBQ sauce.  The potato salad was good but nothing to write home about.  I also got to steal some of my friend's three-bean salad which seemed like it would have helped cut through the fat better than my creamy potato salad.  I love chick peas!  The banana pudding made me want to dance though.  It was the perfect ending to such a rich meal.  I was a happy happy girl.  While I'm no BBQ expert, I enjoyed my dinner at Rudy's and I'd definitely stop by again!",

I don't know how you are able to smoke them AND still manage to keep them so moist! I don't even put sauce on them; they're delicious on their own.   I also had your tasty lean brisket that had a nice bark to them. I even tried your pork ribs for the first time. While they were more meaty than the baby backs, they were not as moist or flavorful.   To add some veggies into the mix, I had some of your coleslaw and corn on the cob, both of which seemed really plain. It's okay though, cause we all know nobody comes here for the sides--unless they're the outvoted vegetarian in a group of bbq lovers!  For dessert, I got your regular praline and chewy praline. The regular one pretty much tasted like brown sugar with pecans. The chewy one however, was divine; the caramel version of pecan pie.   Thank you for a great lunch today. I don't know when I'll see you again, but I will think of you often.   Bbq Wishes, J",

You grab a bucket and can choose from sodas/juices to a wide range of beers. The food is served by 1/2 lb and includes choices such as brisket, moist brisket, pulled pork, sausage, etc. I chose the brisket with burnt ends and was not very pleased with what I received. I'm hoping it's because I arrived an hour prior to closing that I was so dissatisfied, but the brisket definitely lacked flavor. On a brighter note, the cream corn is SO DELICIOUS! I wish I would've ordered more of that! And Rudy's beans were just eh. The girl who attended us didn't seem happy to be there and had a bit of an attitude. Always a huge negative for me. Overall, this is not a place I would go out of my way to come back to.",

The way Rudy's works is that you stand in line, wind around the drinks, turn on the refrigerated goods (potato salad, three bean salad) and end up at the registers where they weigh out the different foods.   The jalapeno sausage is amazing. It's probably my favorite offering. And the rest of the meat is pretty good too. We usually get the sausage and some brisket.   You then take your food, hit up the condiment bar where there are peppers and onions and the like, and find a seat on one of the picnic benches. They keep their bbq sauce on the table and I usually don't even touch it. The meat is too good to ruin with sauce.   Make sure to clean up your area when you're done and they do have some ziploc bags up at the condiment area if you manage to preserve any leftovers.",

You can even get samples if you are not sure what to get. I got 1/2 lb moist brisket with a small potato salad and it was enough for two meals!  The meat was delicious, smokey and juicy. I also tried the stew which was good! Don't forget to try their bbq sauce! Absolute must.  You get to put paper on your table and eat without plates which is a fun experience.  Plenty of tables for everyone.   Don't forget this place does A LOT of bbq so do not be surprised if your hair and clothes smell of bbq at the end of the meal :)  (worth it)",

Walked in the door was greeted and everything was explained to us so we know just what to do. I  had pork ribs and cole slaw, husband got brisket moist. And sausages and my son got the same. He also got bread pudding which he loved. Everything was cooked great, this will be are go to place for BBQ and the fact that it is less then 2 miles from home doesn't hurt. Seating was picnic benches which fit the style of the place perfectly.  I  don't know if it was our timing or not but we got there at 12:30 and had no waiting to order our food. So if you need a fast place to eat at lunch it us a good place to go.  Give it a try you will be happy.",

The other half loves this spot in Texas and was pleased to find this Phoenix location offers even more choices with prime rib on the menu and ready to go breakfast tacos in a bunch of different combinations. This bbq joint has the perfect balance of quality food at a great price and the service was spot on each time we visited.   My favorites while we were here were the Spicy Chopped, the ribs (every kind was good) and that chocolate pudding. That chocolate pudding has oreos in it!!! So good. On top of all that they have a pickle and pepper bar. That's right ALL YOU CAN EAT PICKLES! Gotta love that BBQ and pickle combo!   If you're stopping by in the morning for their Breakfast tacos know that they are big enough to turn into a respectable breakfast burrito with the right folding technique and the Spicy Chopped bbq breakfast taco is the best, you can try the others but I've already done the work for you- go spicy chopped!  This location also offers prime rib and it's only $9.99 for a 1/2 pound... pretty reasonable and it has great flavor.   If you're looking for delicious meat at a great price head to Rudy's and plan to come back for breakfast... we did!",

    "text": "Having been to this location a half dozen times (and 23 of their current 41 locations) it's safe to say I know Rudy's well. Many would call me a BBQ fanatic. In the last decade my friends and I have been to more than 500 BBQ restaurants in the US. To be honest, it's probably more. We come to Rudy's often because we always know what we are going to get: friendly service, great BBQ and enough food to feed the family without spending too much money. Rudy's is good for consistency. Every piece of meat is cooked well. At this great Phoenix area location I've never been disappointed.   While many in Arizona might not be aware Rudy's is a chain one that dominates the Texas landscape and continues to grow because it's good. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are stars here. In fact, their breakfast tacos are not only super affordable, but also come in huge portions and out duel most breakfast tacos you'll find anywhere else.   There's much to like about Rudy's. This, like all the locations, is roomy, and packed with good BBQ options. Meanwhile, there are no combos. Everyone orders meat by the pound (or a sandwich) and have an abundance of choices, none of which disappoint.   The Meats:   Turkey: Hands down: some of the best, mouthwatering, tender and moist turkey in America. And, it tastes like this every time.   Briskets: It can be ordered lean or moist. Moist is for those who don't mind the fatty stuff (which is where the flavor stems from). Lean comes mostly without fat and a a bit drier. Each tends to hit the spot.   Chicken: To be honest, we often overlook the chicken, simply because the turkey is so darn good. However, if there's a few of us and we want to sample several meats we'll get a half-bird, something no one has ever complained about.   Sausage: Take a pick: regular or jalapeno. Different tastes. Nevertheless, each impressive.    Pulled Pork: It's a challenge to order the pulled pork when the rest of the meats are so darn good. Still, it's above average and tends to be less dry than at many BBQ chains. It suffers like the pork loin - not because it isn't good, but since there's so much competition.   Ribs: The pork spare ribs and baby back ribs tend to be complete with fall off the bone and tender meat. Keep in mind, you don't have to buy a half or full rack. You can order by the bone.   Spicy Chop: This is a smorgasbord of Rudy's meats chopped up and marinated in spices - and it's one of our favorites. So much flavor. So tasty. A must.   The Sides/Dessert   If you don't mind a lil kick order the green chili stew. Mmm! Be forewarned, it's spicy, but seeing fresh green chilis in the soup proves they make it on site and adds more flavor than you can imagine. The rest of the sides are fine, too. That includes the potato salad, creamed corn and cole slaw.   On the other hand, normally we stick with the meats and save room for one of the desserts (the banana pudding, chocolate pudding and cobbler are tops (they change seasonally). The desserts aren't made in house (the rice krispy treats are, however, we're told), but do impress and could fool you, because they taste good enough to believe they were made in house.   When in the mood for BBQ Rudy's is a home run regardless of time of day. You'll find wonderful meat, won't have to spend too much money and can enjoy eating in a comfortable atmosphere. And, in Phoenix, it's tough to find better sweet tea.",

They also give you almost a whole loaf of bread just in case you want to go up a pant size after our meal.  I tried the pork. It was juicy and just delicious. Their sauce is at each table so you can go nuts with it if you'd like.  I like how the food is served in industrial plastic trays, like the kinds used for soda 2 liters. They make sure you know they aren't messing around.  Great BBQ place in Chandler!",

We didn't add meat to the potato and honestly this was the low point of the meal.  I would recommend skipping this menu item altogether. Baby back ribs (1/2 pound) - delicious and recommend. Brisket (cutter's choice) (1 pound) - delicious and recommend.  Cutter's choice just means you'll get some combination of moist and lean brisket. Cream corn (pint) - outstanding!  You will not be disappointed. Slice of pecan pie - pretty good but doubt you'll need it after ordering a bunch of meat.  I took a couple of bites and took the rest home.  Total with taxes was ~$56.  This place isn't cheap and definitely no frills however you're not going to be disappointed with any of their meat choices.",

Took some friends who are on low carb diets.... there is no better place for a carnivore to get their protein bomb!   We had brisket (my favorite), pork, sausage, and turkey. Sides of Cole slaw and creamed corn for us, along with cheap white bread and pickles. Such a tasty meal. The brisket is so Moist and smoky. And I Love the Rudy's sause!! So perfect with these smoked meats.  Order at the counter, meats by the pound, sides by the pint, free white bread. Bottled beers iced down in coolers as you approach the counter. Desserts and cold sides in a fridge just before the counter. (I do not recommend the banana pudding, but the Cole slaw is good! Pickles, onions, peppers at a salad bar.  No plates. You eat off wax paper with plastic utensils. No fancy pants here!!!",

    "text": "I feel sorry for Texans if they think THIS is good BBQ!  Go to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert.  We were excited to try a new BBQ joint closer to our house since we normally go to Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert..  Now listen fellow yelpers, you have never steered me wrong.  So I was convinced this was going to be good, after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place.  I cannot say that I agree with the good reviews of this place at all.  We arrived at 5:45 PM on a Sunday eve and were cheerfully greeted by a young lady who helped us figure out how it worked.  You grab a bottled beer or soda (or they have cups where you order for fountain drinks) and then order at the counter.  No line and we got up to the counter and I decided on the moist brisket, given the good reviews I had read on here.  I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into, as there are no trays or plates!).  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread. I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough.  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much.  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables, like on a cruise ship!  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles.  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream.  It was not tasty at all.  The beans were not bad.  But the moist brisket....it was moist alright - it was oozing fat!  I think 50% of the meat was fat.  I was somewhat disgusted.  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either.  Luckily, he had chosen Lay's BBQ chips for his side. Cannot go wrong there!!  Pretty sad when the best part of your meal is a bag of Lay's BBQ potato chips.    I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back \"ya'all\".",

The beef brisket had a bit of smoke to it but that was cut down using honey barbque sauce.  Our first time we had a sampler of meat which also had the turkey breast and it was very nice and flavorful.  I was impressed after being so disappointed by Joe's B Q in Gilbert where my meat was beyong being able to chew and dry, so if your one of those people who says Joe's the bomb.. check out Rudy's cuz your missing something!",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've flexed my review muscle but here goes...  This place has some of the best bbq I have ever come across. The brisket and ribs were especially good. The ribs were so tender you didn't need teeth because they just melted in your mouth. We also had pulled pork, corn cobs, sausages, coleslaw and potato salad. All of those additional items were excellent but I still felt the ribs and brisket stood out. There are a couple of reasons this place won't get my fifth star; the noise level and the order process. If you've never eaten at this place before it can be a little confusing on how to order and where to get in line. Not to mention I dislike being rushed and in order for you to see the menu you have to get in line and getting in line is something people do when they are ready to order. I just thought it was a weird set up..Back to the noise level, I like to enjoy conversation with my food and when I don't enjoy the atmosphere I'm in I don't enjoy the food as much. The restaurant is set up with long picnic tables and you just sit anywhere. The tables are right next to the ordering line and the ice machines, etc,. So there is a lot of noise an activity right where you're eating. In conclusion the food is delicious, the price is right and the atmosphere is...acceptable. So, belly up to the trough!!",

    "text": "I'm torn on this one. I had tried Rudy's in NYC during the BBQ fest a few different times and remembered liking it, so I was stoked to learn they had a location outside of Austin. Some aspects of this place are fabulous, but some make me want to run away and never return. BF and I ordered food to take home from here after a trip to IKEA (we both needed a reward for surviving that place on a Sunday!). We ordered: 1 potato w/Moist Brisket, 1 side of stew, 1 pulled pork bbq sandwich, a side of beans, and one fountain drink.   The way you order food is the same for here and to-go, kind of like Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert (which, I'll just tell you right now, is FAR AND AWAY 100x better than this place overall). They even have the troughs of sodas and beers to choose from-I'm fairly certain the bottled Coke is of the Mexican variety, though as you'll learn in a moment, I did not opt for the bottled soda. If you're debating between bottle and fountain soda, GET THE BOTTLE!!!!!!!! I can. not. stress. this. enough.  Why, you may ask, is it so vitally important that one not order a fountain soda? Well, my friends, Rudy's sadly does not filter their water. The ice cubes were revolting, which was my first clue-as I popped one in my mouth I was immediately repulsed, but for some reason I decided to chance it with the soda (which, duh, is made with the same non-filtered water + syrup). BAD IDEA. Grossest soda everrr. And I love fountain sodas! From places that actually filter their water, that is. I wish Phoenix water was better, maybe I'm just spoiled from my time in NYC where I could drink tap water with no weird taste, but BF agreed that the water was definitely funky. Sadly, this problem affects other aspects of the food, causing anything that was steamed by the water to have a weird taste (at least I'm guessing that's why). What's interesting is their sweet tea (which is unbelievably sweet, and is much more palatable when mixed with the unsweetened, conveniently located directly next to it) is delish. I'm chalking that up to the water being boiled first in order to make the tea.   On to the food...my \"moist brisket\" was moist, as promised, but was comprised mostly of fat. I know I've had brisket that is both moist and not fatty before so maybe it was just a one-off. The potato didn't taste like a baked potato, probably because it's roasted and not baked, but it wasn't at all crispy skinned like I was hoping. I'll take the blame for that one. The pulled pork was moist and juicy and the sandwich bread was perfect for it. The beans, not so great-too runny and had a flavor I wasn't a fan of (can't put my finger on it, which I realize is not that helpful).   The stew was the highlight by far-it's a pork stew with what I believe was green chilis and potatoes, and had a really unique and tasty flavor that had both me and the BF craving more. I recommend pairing it with corn chips!   The prices were definitely great-we got out of there for under $20 for a ton of stuff! We also snagged some of the to-go sauces so we can experiment with the tangy bbq on other foods at home. The staff were friendly and definitely do a LOT of work-when you place your order at the counter, the cashier is the one who puts all of your food together, including assembling sandwiches! I would come back to try some of the other menu items, but if it's brisket I'm craving I'm heading to Joe's next time.",

The corn of cob wasn't very good at all. It was mushy and way over cooked. We did ask for butter and she put a ton of butter which didn't help the corn at all. I would give the sandwiches a 4.5 on the stars but the pricing on the drinks and corn of cob 1 star which I believe would take it to 3 stars",

Pros:  -There is sauce a-plenty and they are all pretty tasty             -Creamed Corn is OUT OF THIS WORLD              -Big space with plenty of seating             -Location is easy to find and near lots of shopping  Cons: -Service is a bit unprofessional flirting and weird comments abundant            -There are no french fries (BBQ without fries is kind of un-American)             -\"General Store\" is pretty lame.  Nothing like a Cracker Barrel.               I say try it.  If for no other reason than that freaking amazing creamed corn!  I know this sounds weird.  As a rule I am not even a big fan of creamed corn, but WOW!  This stuff is GOOD.",

    "text": "I am from an area of the country where BBQ is known for its high standards and quality. This restaurant came highly recommended and my anticipation was high due to the fact it is hard to find good quality BBQ in Phoenix. The service was fast, the dinning room has that down home pleasant feel, and that is where the pleasantries end.  I ordered the smoked pork ribs, baked beans, and coleslaw. The ribs were smoked but boiled before hand. The baked beans turned out to be reasonably seasoned pinto beans. The coleslaw tasted as if they had simply taken the cabbage from the bag and added a generic dressing to the mix.   The other catch to the whole experience is (BUYER BEWARE), they weight the proteins (brisket, ribs, turkey, etc...). The cost of the meal was overly priced.   The entire meal lacked the desired flavors my appetite craved...  For those who know BBQ, don't insult your finely tuned tastebuds with this so called representation of smoked BBQ. Just because its has the smoked flavor, doesn't make it BBQ...",

We ordered 2 pounds of ribs, 1 pound of brisket moist, 1/2 pound of pulled pork, 1/4 pound of spicy brisket, some new potatoes and a baked potato.   The best part of the meal was easily the spicy brisket. It was so moist and flavorful, and not too spicy. I wasn't too big of a fan of the ribs and needed to add more BBQ to flavor them. Everything else was amazing and was some of the best BBQ we had.   They also take your order fairly quickly and I love that they have it hot and ready. It is so much nicer than waiting!  My only complaint was the young lady who took my order. She did not seem happy to be working and was very rude to us because we had a larger order. Other than that, we were very happy with everything!",

    "text": "First rule of BBQ, since there's BBQ options everywhere, (across the st.) you better make it great to get me back, you better make it amazing to get me to bring a friend. After Saturday I will do neither because Rudy's broke the rule. Note to Rudy, COLD BBQ at any price is not very good.  We ordered the moist brisket, good thing as I would have hated to see the not moist version. Really good brisket but cold and not really moist. Brisket baked potato, good lord how do you serve a baked potato cold where the butter just sits there and the cheese never has a prayer to melt.  It was terrible to try and mash the cold butter, cold sour creme and cold cheese together when the potato is hard and, yes, cold. BBQ Chicken, amazing but this was the worst part of the meal. BBQ chicken from a \"BBQ\" place should have a dark char to the skin with some kind of heat or flavor to say BBQ. This thing was 4 pieces of yellow fowl, literally cold to the touch with flavorless skin.  Yes I could have taken it up and asked them to serve me a hot, maybe warm meal that I just paid a lot of money for. We just picked on a potion of it and threw the rest away.  So back to the rule. I will not be back and I did tell a friend but it was not what Rudy's was hoping for.           Note to self, when you walk into a BBQ joint at 12:00 on a Saturday and there's no line, go next door.",

As I started walking into the restaurant, I heard some country music.  I knew that at least the ambiance going in would be authentic.  You start off your journey by picking up a beer.  I recommend the Shiner Bock IPA or original Shiner Bock.  You can choose assortment of meats and sides.  If it is your first time or if you want to sample something, they will give plenty to try out.  I highly recommend their jalapeno sausage and pork loins.  When you are done, you can ask for bread and make a little sandwich with whatever items you picked out.  Lastly, you have an area where you can pick up your condiments and sauces.  The BBQ sauce here is awesome!",

There are no \"to go\" boxes, you have to wrap your meat in a brown paper bag. Some restaurants do their own thing that makes them cool, but no... meat sliding around in a bag doesn't sound clean or secure.

Beans I was not impressed, it was bland and it tasted and looked like it was sitting for a while. I enjoyed the potato salad. Lastly, the peach cobbler was terrible. 2 our 4 items were good.

You can eat with your bbq-sauce-covered hands, and wash it clean at the wash station, except this is much easier to clean off without smelling like fishy hands after scrubbing for so long.    Anyway, you go in and order from a simple menu - easy to read and not much figuring out to do.  We ordered a brisket sandwich, turkey sandwich, and 1/2 pound baby back ribs.  It is prepared and ready to go - just like that!  Then you bring it over to the picnic-like long tables where you share with fellow hungry people.  Sauces are placed on the table so you can pour it right on the table.  But first you have to go to the paper roll and rip off a piece to place on the table.  Collect your utensils and drinks at the appropriate stations.  Then chow down.  I tried the Sissy sauce because I am a sissy when it comes to hot sauces.  I also tried the BBQ sauce and enjoyed both flavors.  But tasting the smoked baby back ribs by itself without the sauce was also tasty.  You can tell that it's tender and juicy.  The taste is different from it being grilled, but just as good!",

My friends and I had heard Rudy's opened up a restaurant in Chandler and that it was supposed to be great. We decided to brave the line about a week ago and give it a whirl. I must say, it was definitely worth the wait!   I went with the St. Louis style ribs and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The meat came off with a fork, just the way it's supposed to. As a side I ordered the green chile stew. It was good, but nothing to write home about. Friends went with the lean brisket, the chicken, and a brisket sandwich. We all enjoyed everything. The beer selection was good and it was nice that you could grab it while waiting in line. We also liked that you put the sauce on yourself, deciding how much or how little you wanted.    Only 4 stars (or probably 3.5 really), because they were OUT of pulled pork! No pulled pork? We couldn't believe it. That and the sides were just okay: we had the stew, the cole slaw, and potato salad.",

    "text": "So yesterday I finally made time to check out Rudy's BBQ.  I work right around the corner and have been to the place across the street several times and figured it was time to give this place a shot.  It was almost 2 PM when I arrived and I was greeted by someone who explained how the placed worked.  I was able to walk right up and order, but I've seen the line backed out the door on more than one occasion so it was definitely the time of day (I purposely went later to avoid the crowds).    I ordered a 1/2 lb of smoked turkey, half a sausage link, pinto beans, and a large drink for just under $14.  The turkey was moist & tender but I didn't taste much of a smoked flavor.  It wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't great.  The sausage was good also.  I like spicy, so I only tried the spicy bbq sauce.  I found the stoppers on the bbq sauce bottles to be cumbersome to get an appreciable amount of sauce to come out.  I actually didn't care for the sauce, as it had an overly-tangy flavor which overwhelmed the meats.  I really prefer when a bbq place has the big kettle of sauce as opposed to bottled sauce.  The beans...well they were OK...definitely no pizzazz to them...for just being plain pinto beans, they were decent, but definitely not great....if I go again, I'll probably try the cole slaw instead.  I've been to a few mom & pop bbq joints in Tx and Rudy's does a good job of duplicating that ambiance.  Bare concrete floors, long rows of tables with paper table cloths on one side and picnic tables on the other...and that open ceiling architecture.....I can imagine the how loud and echoie (is that a word???) the place gets when it's packed!  I read some reviews complaining about the wax paper in lieu of a plate....sure enough, my paper split open while cutting off a bite of sausage...exposing it to the table.  Hope it was clean...I ate it anyway  lol    I'm giving Rudy's 3 stars because I think it's OK, but not great.  I will go back and try the moist brisket to see how that goes.  Good Eats, B",

It's served a la carte, they slice the meat right in front of you, and the line moves faster than you would expect. This is my favorite bbq place in the valley. You gotta check it out if you love bbq. It's very pure.  There are some downsides, and the only reason I didn't give them a five star review. They serve the food in a large plastic beat up crate. Maybe I'm just not getting it. Your food is simply on a piece of white butchers paper. I wasn't sure what to do with all that paper. Unfortunately they don't have plates. Without plates, it's hard enough for a gown adult. It's even harder when I bring my kids here. They do ask to go back there, so that's a good sign. It's cafeteria style that is a bit confusing and disorganized. Seems like every time I get to the table I've forgotten something. The side dishes are very bbq themed, but to a fault. I personally didn't like any of the side dishes they had. I tried the baked potato and butter side dish. It was essentially potatoes in a broth made entirely of butter. Seriously I'm not joking. You don't get that much butter when you go out for lobster. They have a peach cobbler, which is refrigerated. I don't know what's up with bbq and peach cobblers, but they do it here too.  Again, this is my favorite place for bbq. I just see some opportunity for improvement.",

Their quality of meat is incredicle, much better than HBs, and the fact they let you sample the different types is great.  The BBQ sauce is very good as well.  I do prefer the memphis style BBQ sauce of Honey Bears but Rudy's is still very good as an alternative.  The beans and the potato salad are the only two sides I have tried thus far.  Both of them were very good.  My only complaint is the lack of fries or mac and cheese.  I am not sure what the reasoning is for not having these items.  I am sure they would do a great job on them based on everything else they have.  I've had breakfast here once and was impressed.  I will be back again for that.  Brisket, eggs and bbq sauce go very well together.",

He came back with beef brisket, 2 kinds of sauces, slaw, sweet cherry pepper and 2 coca cola.  We sat in the car and ate our lunch. It was really good! The meat was sold by the pound. I had a sandwich with warm toasted buns. Hubby had just meat since he can not eat bread. The meat was lean, tender, and flavorful! The sauces, original and sissy, were nice compliments. Slaw was home made and yummy. I didnot know Rudy's is also in Chandler, Az. We will surely visit it there once we get back.",

We ordered 1/2 lb of brisket, pulled pork, and Baby Backs...corn on the cob, cream corn, potatoe salad, and beans. The brisket and baby backs were amazing but the pulled pork had too much pepper. All the sides were good except the beans...bland. My partner loved her cream corn. I like the way they serve you and I had to chuckle when i seen the white bread...brought back memories.

This ain't a sticky sweet BBQ sauce kind of a joint.  The meat brings most of the flavor, the sauces just add a bit of heat and spice.  Brisket as tender as a Jane Austen novel.  Portions as big as Texas.  Prices fit for Arizona.    I'm already starting the Rudy chant for my next visit.",

We are particular fans of the pulled pork and smoked turkey--could eat those every day three times a day!  The sauces are delicious and not overpowering; tangy, but not doused in sugar or corn syrup like so many other places.  And the prices are great--we ate to the bursting point (2 people) for $22 (no drinks).  Plus, as you walk in / walk out, you have the opportunity to avail yourself of a huge array of BLUE BELL ICE CREAM TREATS!  How can it get any better than this???  This is going to be our new \"go-to\" spot whenever we get a BBQ hankering!",

The white labeled bbq sauce was great! The staff were both friendly and helpful. I visit Phoenix often and will be making Rudy's a regular dinner stop!",

It was a bit of a drive for us but well worth it. We loved everything about this place. I had the sausage which was perfection and my husband had the brisket. (He even went back to get more lol) They even were able to give us a small portion of meat for my daughter. The potato salad is great and I love the inside set up. It's like a big picnic.   When we are up for the drive again we will be back for sure. Best BBQ I have had here in AZ so far.",

In every Texas Rudys the Prime Rib was sold out by early lunch. So it was a great surprise when we were able to buy 1 and 1/2 pounds of outstanding medium rare Prime Rib. I can honestly say I have eaten Prime Rib at least 300 times and this would be in my top 5 ever. Afterwards we bought  another pound to take home.  In addition we had the moist brisket and the pork loin. Both of which were outstanding. Easily puts all AZ BBQ to shame.  As a note to the confused people out there... Lean Brisket means no fat and you want your brisket DRY! So stop complaining your LEAN DRY brisket is dry. You ordered it that way. Moist means extra fat and deliciousness. Otherwise normal is a mix of both.",

We met some friends here for a going away party and everyone around the table loved the food. The line on a weekend night is long, but well worth the wait. It is very much a family style, no plates, eat with your fingers type of experience so plan accordingly.   I decided on the pulled pork sandwich and a side of potato salad. The pulled pork was delicious. Served without BBQ sauce so you can add your own. The pulled pork was moist and tender and could have definitely been eaten without BBQ sauce if that's your thing, it's definitely not mine, the more sauce the better. They have two sauce choices. Rudy's original BBQ sauce or Rudy's Sissy Sauce. I of course went for the original seeking some spice and it did not disappoint. It was delicious! The potato salad was just okay, not great, not bad. The pulled pork sandwich with loads of sauce was delicious. This girl didn't mind getting her hands dirty for some good BBQ!  Overall good experience. I will be back for more. From what I hear they have amazing BBQ breakfast tacos which sound different and delicious. I will be back to try those.",

I am just a little disappointed that I have lived here for a year and I am just finding out about this location. What's up with that?  I have been a HUGE fan of Rudy's in Albuquerque, NM for years now. Even made special trips to ABQ just to go to Rudy's . . . and now I find out there is one just a couple miles from my house . . . geez! You mean I could have been eating here all along?  I was out tooling around on a Sunday afternoon thinking I was either going to have to go home or find myself a drive-thru because I was just not going to make it until dinner time . . .  when I saw the sign: **RUDY'S!**  I nearly caused a major pile-up on Chandler Blvd as I whipped my little black Honda around in traffic and scooted into the parking lot, jumped into the only empty space and went inside. I could not believe that this little bit of BBQ heaven was right here in Chandler.   I didn't even have to look at a menu. Pulled pork sandwich, creamed corn, potato salad and a beer, please.  I found myself a small table on the patio and literately scarfed that dreamy sandwich down with occasional bites of creamed corn & potato salad and then washed it all down with an ice cold beer.  Best BBQ on the planet and now it's here within a short car ride, not a plane ride. Heaven, right here on earth . . . er, Arizona!",

Trust me..... the lean brisket is plenty moist!  The spare ribs are a decent size, but you won't get much bang for your buck since you order by the 1/4 pound.  Usually 1 pound of ribs is about 6 ribs.  The meat is smoked to perfection.  I have also tried the moist briket (good, but fatty), the baby back ribs (also good), and the pulled pork which was also very good.  I get their Sissy Sauce for my ribs and brisket.  It is wonderful.  It has just the right amount of heat for me.  They also have a spicier sauce, but I haven't braved it.    As for their sides, the only one I have tried and really liked was their green chile stew.  It has a great flavor.  It seems to get hotter with every bite.  Usually by the time I finish my small cup, my mouth is on fire and my nose is running.  Worth it though, since the flavor is so good.  This place is my favorite BBQ spot in the valley.",

I make awesome pulled pork, and don't need bbq turkey, so it is the brisket, ANY variety, that we indulge in. We don't care for the sides, bland, uninteresting, bread (yuck), BUT did I tell you about the brisket?! We usually just take home a couple pounds, then go buy some GOOD rolls, corn, baked beans, or salad. They USED to give scraps for our dogs, but they have stopped that practice. We are SO disappointed, especially our 2 dogs!! I hope they go back to scraps for our 4-legged friends. We will continue to buy their brisket. It is great for parties or a quick meal and excellent for leftovers. Even for a pinic basket for a nice hike in South Mountain.",

    "text": "We used to be regulars at Rudy's - probably once every week or two for almost a year.  Unfortunately, the quality and consistency has dropped pretty badly these past 2 months.  The brisket will range from awesome (ie full of flavor, moist) to extremely bland and dry.  The ribs are generally cooked well, but the spice rub will range from a nice even taste to having the rub so thick that you can scrape off a few tablespoons from just 4 ribs.  During our last trip, we heard some customers saying that they also noticed the inconsistency, and they said it was because the more senior (and better) BBQ pit masters have started working at their new location on the West side of town.  We also noticed that their business is starting to hurt in the evenings... used to have long lines Friday/Saturday nights, now it's a piece of cake getting your food.  I hope management is reading this, and take this to heart.  My family very much enjoyed Rudy's when they actually cared about what they served - but now we've been forced to find other go-to places (Little Miss Barbecue is by far the best, but unfortunately they are not open in the evenings).",

As far as comparing this to other places,  Little MIss BBQ's short rib is the best I have had in town (including Bobby Qs) but Rudy's beats their regular brisket, and forget about any normal dining time at Little Miss BBQ.  My bar is brisket is too high to give Rudy's a five but even now they are very good.  Seating and speed of service are both very good.",

But really, that is how the story goes of how this place got started, haha! J/K! But could be ;)  I fell in love with this place, very casual, hands on and yummylicious! As i walked in it was love at first smell, I have already decided that I'll be taking my next road trip to AZ just to come and eat at Rudy's... just have to wait for a nice long weekend to come by.  This place is great, they make you feel welcomed and at ease as soon as you come in. By the looks of it, if you've never been there you would get a bit nervous at the way you have to order and just from having to figure it out. But no problem, someone greeted us at the door and explained the entire process and then it was all nice and easy. It sort of felt like I was standing in the lunch line at my old elementary cafeteria, except here you have the option of picking up a metal bucket and filling it with a variety of beers (that would of bee something in school! haha!) or bottled drinks but you can also go with regular fountain drinks if you prefer.   In the seating area there are these long picnic-like tables and TV's around. You use tear out paper instead of plates and you don't need utensils but they have them if you must.   Now lets get down to business; The meat is great, delicious tasting without even any BBQ sauce added. You get to sample as many different types as you like (except with bone) before you buy and they sell it by the pound (lb.) or in sandwiches. Let me tell yall, we tried it all! And it was all great, so good that we couldn't decide on what to get. The turkey was so moist and juicy. The sausage was yummy and spicy. The pulled pork, the beef, the ribs, the brisket...aaah I can go on. It was all yummy! Then you get to add the sauce and its something else from there; spicy, sweet, regular.  I can't go on because I'm going to start drooling just from thinking about it. I will end with this, its a must try if your ever in AZ. Road trip anyone!? Fingerlicking yummyliciousness! Enjoy!  P.S. Oh yeah, they also have a variety of sides (cole slaw, potato salad, corn etc.) and chicken ( and if you must know I don't care for any chicken, but I'm sure thats good too).",

We had the moist brisket, baby back ribs, and jalepeno sausage, along with small beans, cream corn, potato salad, baked potato, and finally a little cobbler.  Standouts were the cream corn, baked potato, and cobbler.  We'd give the ribs 4 of 5, but the brisket, sausage, beans, and potato salad were just okay.  Brisket tasted of artificial smoke that was over powering.  The jalepeno sausage was good but no jalepeno flavor and no spice.  The beans and potato salad were just blah.  Neat environment and friendly service.",

    "text": "BBQ is not generally a classy man's meal, and Rudy's does not look like a very classy joint, so I was skeptical walking into the place.  There are lots of picnic-table style seatings, some red and white checkerboard table cloths, and a trough full of bottles of beer and soda, surrounded by ice.  We walked up to the counter to order, and from that second, it was a 5-star experience.  The girl at the counter was really friendly, and gave us samples since we had never been there before, so we could figure out what we wanted.  The cook/bbq'er/meat cutter behind the counter was having a good time, yelling back for help whenever people were waiting, and getting excited whenever someone new came in and wanted to try samples.  The food was absolutely amazing.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's BBQ, so don't expect exotic plating, but if you want delicious meat on a bun or baked potato, and want to walk away full and satisfied, this is the joint.  It was too hot when we went, but in nicer weather it looks like they open up all of the walls to the outside, which I'm sure makes the atmosphere that much better.  I can imagine returning when it's nicer out, grabbing a few brews, and killing an hour just sitting in the breeze and getting fat off of pulled pork.  There was only one thing I didn't like about Rudy's, and that was the country music playing the entire time, but hey - if you like country music, then YEEEEE HAAAWW GOOD BUDDY go ahead and enjoy that, and even if you don't, it wasn't enough for me to knock a star off of the rating.",

We were a little surprised to find the parking lot packed and when we walked in there was a long line. At 2:00pm! I'd hate to see the line at the lunch or dinner rush. I've heard the line is often out the door.   Anyway, we got in line and began to look over our menu choices. We decided on the brisket and the pulled pork. They had a few sides but nothing I was that impressed with. No french fries and no mac n' cheese. But they did have peach cobbler so I got that.  They sell their meat by the pound. Since we were getting it to go we ordered 1/2 lb of brisket and 1/2 lb of pork. For the brisket they literally open up the smoker, take out a huge slab of meat and cut your slices off and weigh it in front of you. Awesome. Meat-tastic even! We grabbed our bag o' meat, some sauce and headed home.   The meat was very tender and tasty. The sauce is more of a spicy BBQ sauce than sweet but went well on both the brisket and the pork. I liked the pork best, but boyfriend prefers the brisket so everybody wins I guess. And the cobbler was excellent too.   I'd like to go back and try their prime rib that they make on Sundays. they also make breakfast tacos. Hmmm. Maybe that's what I'll do tomorrow....",

We arrived just in time before it got busy and the lines long. The menu was simple with just meats and sides. I had the 1/2lb brisket and a cup of green chile stew. Brisket was tender full of flavor and delicious. The stew was delicious and would definitely have it again. The portions are big and it comes with 4 slices of white bread. So it was very filling and did I mention you can sample an item before buying it?    This place is organized with a table full of condiments, large bench tables for plenty of seating and a little store inside. They've also got a huge sink to clean up after your meal. If you're an ice tea or lemonade person, they sell it by the gallon to take home. Awesome!  If you're a barbecue person or not, give Rudys barbecue a try. You'll be glad you did. Get there early though to beat the dinner rush and avoid the long lines. Oh yea, be sure to pick yourself up some rice crispy treats from there. They're so good. They say they go fast and after trying one, I bought 3 more.",

The line moved pretty quickly and the staff was very nice and patient with all of our questions. They brought us samples to try before we ordered and everything was delicious. I don't eat red meat so I can't speak for that but the turkey was amazing and the sausage too. I ended up ordering the pulled pork sandwich and it was probably the best I've ever had! So much flavor. And my favorite side dish was the creamed corn. Great place wish we had one in LA!",

A huge open space filled with picnic tables and butcher paper for you to eat your meal on - great for families and large groups. You walk by troughs full of sodas when you line up and choose your sides and dessert as you pass the fridges. The family I went with ordered an assortment of meats and sides. Everything looked delicious, except for the fact that all of the meats were just a bit too salty for me....which was a shame. The ribs were probably my favorite between the brisket and pulled pork.",

If you like smoked meats and are picky about how it tastes and is made then I encourage you to head to Rudy's, where they do it right.  My recomendation - 1/2 lb Pulled Pork or Brisket, side of slaw, and a 30 minute nap. Your welcome.",

Having eaten my fair share of BBQ in TX, this was consistent in what you would expect from Rudy's.  #1 PROBLEM: This location has a meat Carver that cuts all the bark off of the meat. WHO DOES THAT?! It is like taking a perfectly cooked steak and then finishing it on high for 5 minutes in the microwave!! Stupid. When I asked them to recarve it, I got some serious eye rolling and attitude from that side of the counter.   The worst part about this is that I started by asking if they sell burnt ends. The employee behind the counter said \"we keep all the bark on, so each peice has some.\"    Retrain or replace, period.   Side note: the napkins are by the butcher paper, at the table with condiments. There SHOULD be rolls at EVERY TABLE next to the sauce, as it always was at each Rudy's I ate at in TX. When you have a bunch of food on your hands/shirt/pants, the last thing you need is a walk of shame to the napkins.",

Walking in I felt right at home, with the rustic/Texas vibe. I had fun picking a beer to accompany my meal out of the big troughs that separate the lines to the ordering counter. The wait wasn't too bad, and I thought it was really cool that they cut and weigh the meat right in front of you. I ordered several different items, some for immediate consumption and some to take home. For my in-restaurant dining, I opted for a brisket sandwich and half of a regular sausage and I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket, 1/2 lb of sauced chop, and a tub of potato salad to bring home. The sausage was very good, the casing had a nice crisp snap to it while chomping it down. I got a little out of control with the regular bbq sauce, and I found that it was a little spicier than I normally go for (the have a Sissy sauce which is more my speed, guess I'm a sissy). The food that I brought home was a nice snack for football Sunday, and my fiancee enjoyed it as well (she's also a Memphis BBQ snob).   This place is a no frills, good ole BBQ joint, that is fun and would be a blast to bring a big group to. I would definitely come back, and I would like to try some of the other offerings they have on the menu.",

This hunk of meat they gave me was like shoe leather at best and tasted like it too. Yea, I've actually eaten shoe leather so I know. Glad I didn't order the 'dry'.   Went back several months later to attempt to satisfy a craving and grabbed a pound of pulled pork. My god people... you call this food? It tasted like someone boiled the meat and then poured on some 'liquid-smoke'. It was all I could do to eat it.  After reading all the 5-Star reviews I just have to think these poor people have never eaten proper BBQ. I'm talking deep-south BBQ... the real stuff. Guess if I want real BBQ I'll just have to crank up the grill and spend 10-15 hours smoking a hunk of meat.",

    "text": "4.5 stars.  Right when we pulled up and parked you could smell the smoke.  We parked right in front of where they load the wood into their smokers.  It was a good sight to see.  Looked like we were in for some great BBQ.  We got in line and I was in awe of the big smokers they have behind the counter.  When you order your stuff, they pull it out of the smoker and cut it fresh for you and weigh it right in front of you on a scale.  They then place it on butcher paper and into a milk carton type tray.  I couldn't wait to try it!  We were in for some grub!  There was no line either (probably due to Easter) at almost noon which was a score!  One of my coworkers used to work at a Rudys in Texas many years ago and he recommended I get a few things....  Pork ribs, creamed corn and a loaded baked potato with meat.  We got that and a whole bunch more too ;-).  We got 1/4 pound lean brisket, 1/4 pound smoked turkey, 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, a half chicken, a loaded baked potato with brisket on top, some creamed corn and some drinks. They also give you slices of white/wheat bread for free so you can make sandwiches out of your meat.  Total came out to $35.00.  Here is how the food stacked up..................  Pork Ribs- These things were fantastic.  They had a fantastic bark on them.  Almost looked burnt but they weren't.  They tasted great and had a strong pepper/smoke flavor to them.  I liked them a lot and my friend wasn't lying when he recommended them.  They were awesome!  Baby Back Ribs-  These were great too.  Not as blackened as the pork ribs but still seasoned well.  The meat came off the bone with just a little tug.  Damn they were good!  Smoked Turkey-  Delicious!  It had the perfect amount of smoke flavor but was still pretty moist and not dried out.  My best friend is a turkey lover (he ordered turkey every chance he could on our KC/Memphis trip a few years back).  He would have loved this stuff.  It was great!  Lean Brisket-  I'm usually not a big brisket fan but this stuff was legit.  You could see the straight up smoke ring around the edge of the meat.  It was tender and delicious.  I don't know if I have ever had better brisket.  I would definitely get it again.  Loaded Baked Potato-  They give you a softball sized baked potato and top it with a ton of butter, cheese, sour cream (we skipped the sour cream) and your choice of meat.  We got brisket on it and unlike the slices of brisket they give you when you order brisket on its own, this stuff was almost like burnt ends chunked brisket.  Tasted great!  Half Chicken-  This is the only thing we didn't really like.  We picked at it a bit and it had a great smoked flavor but we were so full from everything else that we tossed most of it.  Wouldn't get it again.  Creamed Corn-  This was just ok.  I like corn but usually when its corn on the cob.  Plain corn I will eat but I'm not the biggest fan.  This corn tasted like frozen corn you can buy and then they creamed it up.  Its almost like a gravy of sorts.  I probably would not get it again.  We tossed most of it.  Coke products in the fountain drinks.  They had a grip of bottled drinks/beer in huge metal tubs of ice too.  It was cool to see.  My wife got a root beer in a bottle and liked it.  Service was friendly.  They did forget to give me my potato at first but then when we brought it to their attention they got on top of it right away and brought it out to our table.  Total of $35.00 for the giant crate of food we got was well worth it IMO.    This was some of the best BBQ I have had in a long long time.  It reminded me of me and my buddies trip to KC and Memphis a few years back.  The smoked meats are delicious and I would come back often if I lived out here.  Don't even ask me how their BBQ sauce tasted.......I didn't try it.  The meat was so damn good it didn't need any.  That's a winner folks!  Legit Texas BBQ at its finest!",

At first I order half pound of each meat and try out which ones I love the best.  and now, I always come and order my Baby Back Ribs, Brisket (moist), Prime Rib, Sausage... Well Basically Everything.  Every order is at least 1/2 Lb.  Make sure you have a big appetite. Love it when is just meat, no sauce (you add it yourself).  Other BBQ places I get sick of eating them because either too much sauce or too salty.  This is perfect!.  If you want sauce, they have the Rudy's Sissy Sauce and the regular Rudy's BBQ Sauce.  Side orders of Cole Slaw, Potato Salad are my FAVES!.....  Very casual place, eat it with your hands or with forks if you would like.... But I like the Man Cave way.  Glad I found you again!!!!!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  OK, yeah, so Rudy's is a chain.  But it's a chain in the same way that Mastro's is a chain.  The fact that they've expanded way past San Antonio doesn't make it any less delicious.  Texas style BBQ here, specifically Hill Country, smoking with oak.  Butcher paper, meat to order by the pound, sliced white bread.  This doesn't measure up to the best BBQ in the country, but it is very good BBQ.  My three favorite meats are the moist brisket, the jalapeno sausage, and the ribs.  Everything else tastes pretty average to me, and the sauce, I can take it or leave it.  Actually, compared to some other BBQ joints, I think their sauce is pretty weak.  The spicy isn't quite spicy enough, and the mild has this almost watery aftertaste that's a little off-putting.  If they have the prime rib, it is also just OK.  I don't think I'd pay the premium for it when there's other great meat on the menu.  Their sides are better than most BBQ joints.  The creamed corn is pretty tasty, the beans are average.  I'm still undecided on the green chile - it's hearty and filling but lacks green chile.  They also have banana pudding which, if you get one that's been sitting for a while, the Nilla wafers have soaked up some of the moisture of the pudding and the flavor, the outside is a little mushy but the inside still has some crunch so when you dig into it, you get texture with the creaminess of the pudding and banana.  Granted, you can't tell by looking, but you could get lucky.  So if you don't want to wait in line for good Texas BBQ (like at Little Miss), this is the place to go.  Finally, two words - pickle bar.",

You order by the pound, you help yourself to the cold sides before you order, and your beer selection is made as you wait for your turn at the order counter.    Visiting the Chandler area with friends, we decided to go here for dinner on recommendation of the locals we are staying with.  We all had the moist brisket.  It was delicious and mouth watering.  We sampled the sides of creamed corn, cole slaw, potato salad and green chili.  All were outstanding.  The seating is family style and you bus your own table.  All in the south tradition.  The decor is rustic and very fun.  The staff was friendly, helpful and quite entertaining!  If you want good BBQ and you are in Chandler, why not stop in and get your brisket on!   Solid four stars for this establishment.    Now some folks are upset about the plastic utensils, the self serve attitude, but that is all part of the fun of Rudy's.  You won't find any snooty waiters or table service here.",

    "text": "For some no-frills, tasty bbq look no further. Their menu is simple and they stick to the basics. Meats are available by the half pound, and include 4 slices of bread for a 1/2 pound order. Sides include coleslaw, potato salad, creamed corn, green chile stew, new potatoes, and corn on the cob (Just to name a few!).   I liked that they had different options for your brisket. Usually at bbq places I go to it is typically the \"lean\" brisket you get, but here at Rudy's you can decide between \"moist\" (AKA fatty) brisket, lean brisket, and \"Chef's choice\" brisket (I'd imagine this to be the leftover bits of what is carved, since it's cheaper than the other options).   As this was our first time here, the cashier gave us a sample of the lean brisket and the turkey. Both were very flavorful and moist. I'd definitely get either meat in the future. As for my actual meal, I opted for the moist brisket with a side of green chile stew. The order was made quickly.  After you pay, there is a station for condiments that include various peppers, onions, pickles, and packets of sauces (Ketchup, mustard, horseradish). There are also straws and napkins here. The soda fountain is stocked with Coke products, and they also offer sweet and unsweetened tea.  Seating is self serve, and we found a cozy little wooden table stocked with various hot sauces, a \"sissy\" sauce, and a regular bbq sauce. The regular bbq sauce had a nice vinegary tang, with a slight kick of spice. The \"sissy\" sauce to me tasted very similar, except not as hot spice-wise.   The moist brisket was indeed very moist, with unctuous veins of fat running through the meat. I could taste a deep smoky flavor too. The green chile stew was excellent. It was served piping hot, with a superb savory, spicy flavor.   Overall, a nice place to go for some good bbq. I'll definitely be coming here again to try more of their bbq meats!",

The brisket being a particular favorite, closely followed by the pulled pork, and they apparently serve breakfast now, so I'll have to stop in for brisket breakfast tacos sometime soon.      At any rate, Rudy's is one of the better BBQ chains out there, and frankly they're better than many mom and pop shacks I've been to over the years.

We're in a rush that's why we put in the order through the phone ahead of time. The guy said it will be ready in 15 minutes. Got there early at like 5pm. Waited, waited, waited....my husband said after 10 minutes the guy that took the order just said, oh he didn't even bring back our order yet. So thinking they would return with this small order in like another 5-10 minutes. Nope! It literally took them 38 minutes to get our two items together. What the heck. Wish we knew it was going to take 40 minutes for a to-go order, my husband would've just stood in the self order line and gotten it ourselves, that line was not too long. So bothered we had to experience something so unproductive and ineffective. A total inconvenience to very loyal customers.",

There are two ways to order, either go to the front register area and purchase a pre made taco, or go to the main ordering area and customize your taco.  If you are in a rush, definitely go with the pre-made tacos.  They taste fine and are warm.  If you have few minutes to kill, then order your custom taco and walk around, explore the \"interesting\" Texas/Nascar/gas station decor.  I ordered the brisket with potatoes, cheese, and eggs.  It comes with a flour tortilla.  I found that one did not fill me up so I ordered another.  The piece de resistance, the meat, was tender and moist, just as expected.  It did have a gas type of oder which I was not digging.   Now I need to go back and explore more of my normally suppressed carnivore urges and try the lunch and dinner offerings.",

    "text": "I found Rudy's when I was working in Albuquerque.  One job assignment took me by the location every day for a week and I ate at Rudy's every day for lunch.   I am hooked on the extra lean brisket, corn on the cob (swimming in butter...yum!) and the banana pudding.   I love that the meat isn't already covered in sauce because the meat really doesn't need it, but also, I like a very specific amount and others rarely get it right.   I order the brisket extra lean because I hate paying for \"fat.\" They get it right every time.  The banana pudding has Vanilla Wafers as a faux crust and I love the blend of pudding and cookie.   It completely reminds me of what my grandmother would make if she ever made something like this.  I shared other reviewer's frustrations about the sauce and the bottles, but I've gone to Rudy's so many times now that I know how to tip/shake the bottle to dispense the correct amount of sauce.  It's really not that annoying, but I can see how first time visitors would think, \"Am I doing this right?\"  While you run the risk of sitting next to people you don't know, there is plenty of seating indoors and in the covered patio.  My only suggestion on ways to make this location better would be to make the order placing area bigger.  During busy times, it's difficult to navigate through the crowds at closer registers to registers down the line.  Larger families prohibit access to the salad and dessert refrigerator until the next cashier is literally shouting, \"NEXT IN LINE.\"   I've had a cashier repeatedly shout at me to come to the register as I was frantically trying to get my side dishes and banana pudding from the 'fridge.    It temporarily ticked me off, but the friendliness she showed once I got to the register negated the impact of the shouting.  All in all, I happily make the 30 minute trek to Rudy's just to sit, talk and enjoy!",

    "text": "First visit. Early lunch.11:00AM on a Thursday. Sampled Moist and Regular Brisket and smoked turkey. Ordered moist brisket sandwich, slaw & potato salad. The brisket was moist. They do it right. Melts in your mouth and you can basically chew it with your tongue.Smoky pork goodness galore! The slaw was ..meh. No tang, mostly cabbage in a bland watery sauce. The potato salad was good. Nothing to write home about, but it had a good tang to it and was not off-putting. Free drink refills. Large gets you a big plastic cup that you can bring back in for $.75 refills.  I drove from north Phoenix to met a friend for lunch on my day off and I would say it was worth the trip. My buddy had the beans, which he stated in his review, were bland. Even after doctoring them up with BBQ sauce.  Would have been 5 start except for the mediocre sides.",

I wasn't as impressed with the spare ribs because they seemed way too peppery.  Tell them it's your first time in and they will let you try most anything.  Unfortunately, there was a 30+ minute wait from the time of getting in line to getting food.  I did it once but I won't be doing it again.  Once the new appeal diminishes, it should be a good lunch place.",

    "text": "I live out in Ahwatukee and I swear there is no bbq joints within a ten mile radius, well unless you count honey bears a \"REAL\" bbq joint which I definitely do not.  Being a bbq connoisseur myself (claims the fiance), I was so thrilled to see a bbq joint come up right next to the 10.    My fiance and I went Rudy's the second day they were open.  The line was out the door and I thought to myself \"This place has got to be amazing with a line like this!!\".  The line went pretty fast so it wasn't too bad.  I think it took us less than 30 mins to get up to the registers.  They sell meat by the 1/2 pounds and they weight all the meat right there in front of you.  They also give you your choice of wheat or white bread.  We only asked for 4 slices but we saw a guy in front of us ask for a whole loaf and they literally handed him a brand new loaf to take to his table!  They serve all your food on wax paper and put everything in a crate for you to carry to your table.  This, I was not too thrilled about cause I felt weird eating off my table with just some wax paper between my food and my table.   So on to the food.....  My fiance and I ordered a half pound of babyback ribs (which are my favorite) and a half pound of their moist brisket (which is his favorite).  We also tried their cream corn, green chile stew, and their banana pudding for dessert.  I gotta say that I was highly disappointed with their ribs.  Maybe I'm not use to \"TEXAS\" style ribs, who knows?  As I was eating the ribs, I was telling my fiance that I know I'm eating a rib but its weird cause I feel like I'm eating a rotisserie chicken.  It didn't have much of a bbq taste to it at all. We both didn't finish it, it was just too weird eating ribs that taste like chicken.  With that being said, the brisket was AMAZING to say the least!  Nice and moist, perfectly cooked.  Probably the best in town!  Their cream corn is really good as well and that's coming from someone who doesn't like cream corn.  The green chile stew was to die for.  My fiance loved it so much he inhaled the whole thing before I knew it!  The banana pudding is just as good as everything else.  We did enjoy the food for the most part enough to come back a second time.  We pretty much ordered the same thing except I decided to try the half chicken instead of the ribs and come to realization that they use the same rub on their chicken as their ribs.  Which explains why I thought I was crazy thinking the ribs taste like chicken from my first experience!!  The chicken was nonetheless really good cause well, IT TASTED LIKE CHICKEN!!   Overall, the place has the best brisket.  I had to give take away 1 star for the ribs.  Ribs are my favorite and if you can't do that right I don't know what else to tell ya!  The other star is for the whole eating on wax paper.  Rudy's is lucky my fiance is a man and doesn't care if he eats off dirt, but me, i prefer a plate thank you very much!  So if you're looking for the best brisket in town, Rudy's your joint, but if you're coming for some awesome ribs, I wouldn't suggest it.  I'll stick to Joe's Real BBQ for my ribs.",

Not for the refined palate, no clear \"order here\" placement, your meat is weighed on a scale in front of you and placed on wax paper in a big plastic crate, no plates to eat off of, plastic utensils, and the \"barbecue sauce\" tastes like tomatoes paste mixed with sugar and a TON of pepper, try next door instead, maybe they use plates and silverware. 1 star for the potatoes salad... and that's being polite.",

Naturally when I found this one in AZ I was completely obsessed and insisted on getting my entire family together to eat here so they could experience the Rudy's I've long raved about. We places our orders and we were VERY disappointed. The brisket I so remembered in Austin Texas tasted nothing like it did in AZ. It was super fatty and gross. Not even the famous creamed corn that I long for tasted the same. I almost cried when I left that's how disappointed I was. It was so bad that I still can't get my family to try it again praying it was a fluke :(",

The cashiers shout orders to the cooks, the cooks shout at the cashiers, and the manager shouted at everyone.  The other complaint I have is the lack of plates.  I just don't like putting your food on a questionable table top with only wax paper between it and my food.  I ordered the moist brisket, and although tasty, my portion was very fatty.  My wife had the ribs and thought they were good but not great.  All the sides were good and my wife did love the creamed corn.  To be fair I guess we will give it another try, but we will bring our own paper plates.",

Its nestled conveniently across from a Whataburger, so it's almost like Little Texas!  So it's not got the charm of a convenience store/gas station like the ones I'm used to, and okay, there's no giant Rudy's \"Sause\" dispenser, but I very quickly got over that. (But can they maybe do something about those slow dispensing bottles at the table?!)  The long cooler had plenty ice cold Shiner Bock, so that scored some points right off the bat.  Service was super friendly, even if a bit slow (quality takes time, I had to remind myself), and though most of the same quality exists, there's just one thing keeping me from giving 5 stars: chewy brisket.  The flavor is there but it's just missing on texture.  Turkey and sausage were right on.  I was pleased with my favorites, new potatoes and creamed corn.  The beans looked and smelled reeeally good, but I personally didn't try any.    I know I'll be going back here, getting my fix and taking a little flavor trip back home.",

First time visitors and we read the comments posted on Yelp so had a bit of an expectation going in.  You stand in line, check out the menu, grap bottled drinks, get your salad sides and desserts out of the cooler and then up to register to order.  We were offered a tasting of lean brisket and turkey...which were great.  My partner had decided on the brisket in line and quickly changed to the turkey.  It was fabulous!  I had the baby back ribs.  They were meaty and yummy.  Yes...no sauce, which is exactly how we like them because then you control the amount of sauce you want on them!  We also had the cole slaw (it needs more dressing, guys...a bit dry), the 3 bean salad (a bit sweeter but we both really liked it) and we had to try the smoked baked potatoe (butter, sour cream, and cheese)...dang it was big (like a small football) and yummy.  You can definitely taste the smoke on the skin.    You sit at community tables, which was fine by us!  We love to meet and chat with new people...we sat out on the porch, which was great!   The condiment bar was clean and nicely stocked.  Previous reviewers mention that you eat on paper, use plastic, etc....we think that's what brings the uniqueness to Rudy's.  We had no issue!  We both had ice tea; my partner loved the sweet tea!  I had regular, which was good.  There are two bbq sauces to use...I'm a whimp so I found the whimpy sauce good, a bit peppery, but I liked it.  Certainly not the best I've ever had but then everyone has their favorite sauce!  My partner tried the hotter one and ended up using the whimpy one as well.  We had the banana pudding for dessert...my partner loved it and I thought it was ok...not a big fan of soggy nilla wafers!  Service was attentive, the place is clean, and we love the big handwashing sink to clean up after eating!  All in all...a great experience and yes! We'll be back to try the \"famous\" breakfast tacos\"!!!",

There can be only one five-star barbecue in the valley, and I don't want anyone to think that I am throwing around five stars to just anyone. Having said that, the only thing that stops me from hitting Rudy's for breakfast 4-5 days a week is that they stop serving breakfast at 10:00 am and I don't feel like fighting traffic back into downtown on the 10 on weekdays - their breakfast tacos are that good! (At one time there was a Rudy's location in North Texas that served breakfast tacos anytime the restaurant was open, so here's hoping for that change in the future!)",

Once in line, you can choose from a variety of bottled drinks or can order a fountain drink at the end. Then you can choose a cold side and/or dessert such as cole slaw or pudding. Then on to the main attraction...a large cutting station behind the registers where you order sits several cuts of meat to choose from. And the best part is you can try any (or all) of them before buying. This really made the difference.  I tried the pulled pork, the lean brisket and the moist brisket. I ended up with the moist brisket sandwich. It was amazingly tender. I also choose the chocolate pudding (YUMMY) and corn on the cob. All the food was delicious.   Pro: You can set your own meal. Price is by the half pound so if you want a bit more, that is a plus. Also, you don't have to have a set meal. It's what you make of it.  Con: First time here, and I felt a bit rushed while in line. This made it a bit stressful. Also, I would suggest to add salt to your dish as it was a bit lacking in the meal.   Overall: I would go again, just because I can get something different every time and I can taste before I buy.",

The cafeteria style ordering is I guess okay, but getting ur food in a milk crate and then eating off a piece of paper was not appealing. We ordered the turkey, baby back ribs, corn on the cob, and the store bought coleslaw and potato salad. I will say the smoked turkey was delicious, and just full of flavor. The baby back ribs, eh.. The corn on the cob wasn't that good either, kinda tasted like it's been sitting on the cooler then brought back out and re-boiled. Would I return, most likely not given the fact that there are other places through out the valley to try. The price was decent, figure that u will spend about 12-15 a person, you order by the half pound and grab your store bought sides from the cooler. Well if you decide to visit, stick with the turkey cuz the meats arent that good, Well in my opinion.",

Rudy's is the first one but I'm not planning in comparing against each other but to rate my experience.  The ambiance and decor is nice if you like the back patio setting style with big tables barn-like. I liked it but I could easily understand people being annoyed by this.  Service. A line-up service where you buy your food by the pound with the drinks in coolers is kind of interesting. It reminds me Fuddrucker's back in the late 80's.  Presentation. A huge tray without plates, all in paper (butcher paper) gives (again) that backyard family bbq appeal that can be disappointing for some people.  Price. The price is just OK, not a bargain (given the self-service and no silverware/china) but it's not a rip-off by any means.  Food. The meats were tasty but they cook them without sauce. I had lean brisket (which was pretty good) and baby back ribs. Being said that the meat is tasteful, the sauces are on the lame side. Nothing impressive and the hot and mild have a forgettable flavor.  Would I go back? Maybe.  Would I crave to go there? Absolutely not.",

I also liked the foot handle that they have on the bottom of the bathroom doors so you don't have to open the door with your hands.  The sandwich prices appear fare but once you add sides and a drink to your sandwich, it get's costly.  I did not like that they use disposable utensils, plates and cups.  I understand that they are trying to keep from having servers but Panera Bread uses reusable dishes and utensils and do just fine without servers.  I got the pulled pork sandwich.  It tasted fine at first but then I noticed a strange aftertaste, kind of chemical-like.  The place seemed very popular but I am not sure I would come back.",

Most everything on the menu is great, but all I need is the moist brisket (if you are trying to save on some calories, go for the lean...but I say save up your daily calories for just one meal and go moist), and a bucket of creamed corn and I'm in heaven.  Okay, maybe some sweet tea too.  If you're feeling spicy, go for the sausage, it has great flavor!  Hey, driving to Chandler beats driving to Texas.  And this brisket is driving to Texas worthy.",

    "text": "Ok, this isn't my first rodeo at Rudy's.  Because I travel a lot, I 've been to Rudy's throughout Texas and New Mexico, so going to the new location in Chandler certainly saves me a lot of driving if I develop a hankering for Rudy's.  Now having said the above let me tell you a couple of things I like about the Chandler location.    First, and I've already mentioned, it's in Chandler so now I don't have to go to Texas or New Mexico.    Next, they have onions and pickles for free.  Now that may not seem like much, but the Rudy's in San Antonio (3 locations) and the one by Texas Motor Speedway don't give them away...they cost extra.  Again, doesn't seem like a big deal, but I really like pickles and onions with my BBQ, being able to get what I want without having to pay for it is kind of nice.  As an aside the two locations in El Paso and ABQ offer free pickles and onions.  I'm not hung up on this issue, but it speaks to consistency in my book.  So now some things I didn't like or at least have a question about.    First, every Rudy's I've been to has large stacks of wood to stoke their smokers.  The first time I went to Rudy's (too many people there so I didn't eat) I noticed the wood stack was down to a couple of logs.   So question comes to mine...how are they stoking the smoker?  Or are they?  Are they serving food from a central kitchen?  I don't know, and to be honest, I didn't pay enough attention to how the Chandler location is set up.  Having said that, every other Rudy's I've ever been to you can clearly see the cutters pull the meat out of the smoker.  So bottom line here, not really complaining here, just making an observation which I'll need to do further research on to clear up.  Ok, so on the day I did eat here, the food was good, but frankly food I've had at other Rudy's location was better.  Right now I'm attributing this difference to the fact that this is still a new restaurant so I'm not going to hold it against them.  When we ate there we ordered sausage, brisket, cream corn and potato salad.  So potato salad as always was adequate...not good, not bad...just adequate.  As for the cream corn, this is one of my favorite Rudy's dishes.  Not bad.  Cream wasn't fully set and it was a little bland, but overall still good.  Brisket was ok.  I ordered it moist, but probably should have ordered lean (I make the same mistake every time).  Finally, the sausage...my favorite...and the reason I want those aforementioned pickles and onions.  Not bad but the cutters mixed my order and I got a combination of regular and spicy sausage...I wanted regular.  I attribute this error to this being a new restaurant...so I forgive them for now.  So over all very good.  Will certainly go back",

But they were ok.  Non moist brisket was ok as well, a bit dry though.  The baby back ribs are excellent.  The moist brisket is really just a bit more fatty cut of meat than the non moist but it has much better flavoring and texture.  The jumbo baked potato is awesome.  Its huge, the flavor is amazing.    You cant beat the price.  Overall the value and quality you get are excellent.  Its best to call ahead and do take out, the line to walk in can take you over an hour.  Its great to have Rudy's come to town.",

    "text": "Coming from TX, we know Rudy's. But, have to say the Chandler location was even better than those in Houston. Not an avid fan, but was definitely better.  Line was ridiculous to get in, my guess, something knew = novelty. People were nice, outside area was quiet and spacious.   Food = we sampled the brisket and we ordered the pulled pork. Definitely agree with the reviews, very peppery on the pork, but not fatty. Would get the brisket if we go back. My husband and our friends got the loaded baked potato with meat on top, they rated it better than Joe's BBQ, which says a lot.   I just had the 1/2 lb pork in a tub. Why only 3 stars? Not a fan of the sauce, and without it, meat was just ok. Is more vingary and peppery than sweet. Would I get to go or go back again, probably, but bring my own 'sause'. And, had to add more sugar to the 'sweet tea'. Nix on the coleslaw - no taste.  Overall, good not stellar, but good. TX Roadhouse still has the best pulled pork around if you like it sweet.",

    "text": "Rudy!  Rudy!  Rudy!  Rudy!  If you live anywhere near I-10, you've probably seen that eyesore of a red barn that is Rudy's BBQ.  It's a dining experience unlike any other in the Valley.  It's like a delicatessen, crossed with a picnic, and covered in BBQ sauce.  The BBQ is really good, but I learned a few things that will make my experience even better next time.  Tip #1:  Show up early for lunch.  It's not as packed as when it first opened, but we waited about 10 minutes to order at 11:45.  Wait until 12:15 and you'll have a long line and trouble finding seats.  Tip #2:  Understand what you're getting.  You can order sandwiches, but most people order meat by the pound.  The sign says $6.49 for a half pound of brisket, but you pay what it weighs.  My portion was over $7.  I wouldn't recommend the \"cutter's choice\" option.  I saved some pocket change, but my brisket didn't look as moist or as lean as my friends'.  Tip #3:  Order pint sides and share them among your friends.  It's better value.  They serve the food in what looks to be a wax paper lined milk carton.  After navigating the condiment bar (try the cherry peppers), you can look for a small wooden picnic table, or take up part of a large table covered with red and white table cloths.  As for the food itself, the brisket had a great smokey flavor, but it was dry in places, and had large hunks of fat.  I blame myself for ordering \"cutter's choice.\"  Rookie mistake.  The cole slaw was really good.  The cabbage was minced pretty fine, and it was sweet and creamy, but not too creamy.  The new potatoes were just roasted potatoes in butter.  They definitely needed salt, and the inch of melted butter in the bottom of the styrofoarm bowl was an unappetizing visual.  There were two bbq sauces on the table.  I liked the tangy, vinegary flavor.  One was supposed to be spicier than the other, but they tasted similar to me.  Both had kick.  I have some friends in Austin, TX that think Rudy's rivals Salt Lick BBQ, and I think they're crazy.  It's good, but it's not that good.  The smokey flavor of the brisket definitely stood out, though.  I'm looking forward to my next visit, when I can navigate the menu a little easier.",

I've probably had better brisket, but am no expert, the turkey sandwich is top notch, buttered buns is a nice touch. A surprisingly good craft beer selection in ice buckets you snake past as you wait in line (Goose Island, San Tan, 4 Peaks etc). Service is bizarrely great-you only deal with employees at the counter, but they're extremely helpful and pleasant. Extra slices of bread, napkins, every condiment you can imagine are on the central table, and love the slop sink outside the bathroom so you can wash up & rinse BBQ sauce off as many times as you want without venturing into the loo. Rudy's BBQ sauce is the kicker, a little more spice than smoke, in my spice-loving opinion a great complement to the food & a nice souvenir to take home (Sissy sauce available for sissies). The typical BBQ cabin atmosphere, even a little more folksy than most BBQ places, but that adds to the no-nonsense charm. Will be back once my appetite recovers from this visit.",

When the rest of my party got there at 7 (YES, 7!!!!!), there were 40 people in line, which meant another hour wait for my food. But here's the deal, the food was good.  As grumpy as I was when I finally got it, I really enjoyed it.  Well...the meats.  The sides, blah.  My favorite was the moist brisket.  No need to order anything else.  The pulled pork was ok, as well as the sausages.  But no comparison with the brisket. So it was a good experience despite the extra long wait, and then having to put up with 5 super cranky kids.

You can special order them at the counter if you have a little more time (which is what we do because I am not especially fond of the egg inside) or you can buy them pre made.   Their brisket, bacon and cheese or turkey bacon and cheese tacos are the best... yes, I said turkey! You can get a great low calorie turkey taco for breakfast with lots of protein!    Their meats are so amazing you will not even need the bbq sauce!  Not to mention their green chili stew! And I can't even count the times I have purchased their sausage and turkey to take home to drop into my home made jambalaya!   The only reason I did not give Rudys a full 5 stars is because while their meats are so delicious,  we are not crazy about their bbq sauce. But don't let this deter you.

    "text": "I took a group of 10 to Rudy's at 6:00 on Saturday night. While it was a bit crowded, they were easily able to accommodate our party and allowed us to be seated in the private room. The atmosphere was essentially a knock off of some places I have been in Texas, as was the food.   On entering the line passes by 2 big tubs filled with ice and beer and pop. The assortment of beers that are mostly from Texas was very interesting to find. The cold salads are in a fridge to your left, but with no signage telling you that you have to pick one up there if you wish to eat on the premises.  Next was the main counter. For those who have never eaten Texas style BBQ, you order by the partial or full pound and it is placed on butcher paper on your tray (or in this case crate). I ordered an assortment of meats including the moist brisket, sausage, ribs, and prime rib. I also got the cole slaw, creamed corn, and for dessert, peach cobbler. I opted to skip the bottled drinks and buy a cup to fill at the soda dispenser which is a lot cheaper.  Upon finding my seat, I found there were two sauces for those who prefer their meat that way, along with some hot sauce. There is also a condiment bar where you can get your silverware(plastic) as well as jalapeno's and packets of everything from mustard to horseradish sauce.  The brisket was extremely moist and easily cut with plastic implements. I felt is could have used a bit more seasoning as it usually is in Texas. Next I sampled the sausage. I felt it could have used more spice in it, and ended up having to put mustard on it to be able to eat it comfortably. Unfortunately, the ribs were very tough, and after a number of tries to bite through them I finally abandoned them to the trash can. Last of the meats was the prime rib. A very nice piece of almost medium rare beef, lightly smoked. While the beef was very nice, once again the lack of seasoning caused me to downgrade the experience.  The coleslaw was nothing special, as it was chopped in a buffalo chopper, but my money is on the creamed corn. What a winner! The brisket with the creamed corn could have easily been my entire meal. In retrospect, I wish I had purchased a quart of the creamed corn to bring home it was that good.  Last was the peach cobbler. The cup I was given was almost all pastry, with just a little peach sauce on it. Nowhere did I ever get a bite of a peach. This was a total waste of money.  Other members of our group ordered the potato filled with pulled pork. The portion was very large, but once again, the meat was lacking in flavor.   On the negative side, about 7:30 the place filled with smoke so bad that our eyes were watering. Apparently, they put out the fire pits at that time, and the lack of ventilation makes it a real problem.   BBQ is not a cheap meal. While what I ordered was larger than the average person might order, it still was over $45. Quite a high amount for the quality of food that was received.   It should also be noted that they serve breakfast tacos which are said to be quite good. In my next review of them.  2 Stars for uniqueness and cleanliness.",

    "text": "Rudy's is definitely a solid choice to curb those BBQ cravings and while they don't serve up the greatest BBQ I've ever tasted, they definitely get the job done here (and then some).  What really eats the cake here is how they treat new customers.  If it's your first time, they give you the deluxe treatment with a generous assortment of samples.  This is why every time I go here, it's in fact my first time eating here.  Anyway, I've sampled the majority of their meats and this is without a doubt my favorite combo:  Chopped sausage sandwich + cutter's choice brisket + raw onions + new potatoes (throw on some of that butter) + peppers + bbq sauce = I'd rather be Helen Keller than lose my sense of taste.",

It is very clean inside and the staff was great to us....  One thing that was odd is they told me they cannot accept tips.!!! With that said it felt like a restaurant once you got seated...",

Fresh cut white meat turkey on a bun--rye bread would be better but to keep the cost down, they only offer something close to a hamburger bun. .l also had the small potato salad and a diet coke.   For those who are dining here the first time--the ordering line is long during peak hours. No plates and every item ordered arrives in a tray. Once you get your tray, turn right to the soda machine and condiments. Everything needed can be found here.   As far a \"Real Texas BBQ\", don't expect that here due to the low prices. It is what it is!",

    "text": "After much hype from co-workers, I stopped by for a mid-week dinner. First off, the vibe as soon as you walk in it that of a lunch joint.  It basically looks like a cafeteria.  You shuffle through line and select drinks and sides from the cooler on your way to the counter. Once there, you order and food comes up pretty fast.  The food is served on wax paper, and there are no plates.  Also, no silverware, just plastic utensils. This may be a traditional way to serve BBQ, but when it comes time to cut your brisket, an actual plate and silverware would be nice.  I ended up getting more than one bite with wax paper stuck to the bottom of the brisket.  I ordered the Jalapeno sausage, lean brisket, and corn on the cob.  The sausage was excellent, but again difficult to cut with a plastic knife.  I should have ordered the moist brisket, because the lean brisket was very dry.  The corn was over-cooked and over-buttered.  They have a couple BBQ sauces, neither of which were anything to write home about.  They don't sell corn bread... that's right, no corn bread!  Overall I was not impressed with the food at all.  Service was friendly, and they clear your table when they see empty plates... sorry empty wax papers.  Prices are reasonable.  Rudy's seems like a good spot for lunch BBQ, but don't expect excellence here.",

The food is mass produced garbage. The sides just aren't very good; they taste like they've been shipped from a warehouse. Normally, the brisket is good but rarely is it ever spectacular. The past four times, it's been especially bad.  Today the \"moist\" brisket was so dry that it is nearly inedible. It's texture was more like over-cooked roast beef than it was BBQ. I had to drown it in sauce to give it any kind of moisture. Most Texans will tell you that if brisket is done right you don't need any sauce. The meat should speak for itself, and today, the meat said, \"You really should eat elsewhere.\" And then, there's the pulled pork... It's just horrible. It's really a shame that they try to pass that off as BBQ. You would get laughed out of North Carolina with pulled pork like that.",

The girls had pulled pork sandwiches - good, but nothing special.  My son had corn on cob and a samling of our sides.  Corn had been sitting in hot water (so I am not even going to commment on that).  Sides were good, but average (beans & potato salad).  Good selection of peppers, pickles, sauces, onions and foutain & bottled soda.  Overall it was VERY average to a bit below average, and I think it would take someone alot of time to convince me to try it again.

Our son and daughter-in-law had the Moist Brisket and they said that it melted in your mouth.  We are all definitely planning on going there again and again.  If you want some real Texas BBQ, check this place out.  If you are a first timer, they will give you a sample of any of the meats to try before you order.  It is all priced by the half pound, but you can order as much as you want and they will charge you accordingly.  Most of the meats are like $6.49 for 1/2 pound of the most wonderful, tender meats that you can imagine.  They serve bread, which is complimentary, if you want it.  Their sauces are great.  We loved the Sissy Sauce and bought some to bring home.  Even their original sauce was good.  Banana pudding was pretty tasty too, as we got some for our grandson.  Would recommend this place to anyone.",

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I haven't tried everything on the menu.  So far, the only thing I've had is the sausage sandwich, which I can't seem to get past, because it is so darn good.  My husband on the other hand, has tried several of their items and loves them all.  Besides, any place that serves sweet tea is alright on my list of places; I haven't had sweet tea this good since I left SC.  We currently live in East Chandler, not far from Joe's Real BBQ and I prefer Rudy's over them hands down.",

    "text": "We decided to give this place a try.  When the people coordinating the line found out I had never been there before, they gave me the intro. Sounds like a meat out.  They had lots of choices for meats all smoked.  We got there about noon, and it had a line to the front door.  Interestingly enough, the line did seem to move pretty. At the register, they asked me if I wanted to sample anything (since I hadn't been before).  I went with the smoked turkey.  Wow.  I have to say that this is the 1st time that I've gotten turkey that was not bone dry. The turkey was charred on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  Color me happily surprised.  =)  After reading the reviews on here, I decided to skip all the sides, but did get a sample of the green chili soup.  I think that would be a winner. That taste was most excellent, and it had veggies.  Most of the sides seemed to be a mayo fest, so it was a good call on the skip.  My co-worker, got the prime rib - apparently they offer it on the weekend.  I was less impressed with his prime rib.  My key takeaway from this visit was to go with someone and share. I found 1/2 pound of turkey just WAY too much.  My co-worker was happy to finish it off for me.  My one only slight complaint is that this is must more of a family ho-down type place than a nice dinner out.  I'd suggest getting it to go and doing your own sides at home to go with the excellent smoked turkey.  =)",

The bbq pork rids are my favorite which are thick and juicy. I have tried all of their food and it's ALL good. Gets really busy during dinner time and especially during the weekends. Picnic style seating with red/white table cloths. There have two self serve fountain machines and an island with cherry peppers, pickles, onion-carrot-pepper mix, extra bbq sauce, napkins, silverware,  straws. All help your self. Clean bathrooms and a huge sink to wash all that bbq sauce off your hands just outside the bathrooms. As you walk in there are two water troughs filled with ice cold beers, sodas and teas. The staff is friendly and will help you first timers order if you get overwhelmed by the variety of menu items. If you love bbq try Rudy's you'll be coming back for sure!",

It was really busy, most of the employees had never seen it that busy. Either way all food is sold at half a pound. If it's your first time there they give you samples so make sure to speak up!! I ordered a brisket sandwich, jumbo baked potato, and half pound of chicken. My sister ordered the prime rib, jumbo baked potato, and a corn on the cob. All I have to say is OMG!!!!! Pricing for what we got was $42 but it was well worth it!! They give you so much food it was amazing!!! Everything from the brisket to the chicken to the potato was amazing. The brisket was soft and flavorful and the chicken was cooked to perfection. Everything according to the employees is cooked fresh and served that same day!! You can definitely tell by the way the food tasted and the tenderness of everything. I would highly recommend this place a 100%!! Also recommend bringing your family if you have a lot of relatives or members because they do serve you a lot of food. You will not be disappointed when you eat here. Also the employees are super friendly and if it's your first time they guide you on what you need to do. Also the service is quick you may wait in line for  2-5 mins but the minute you get to the ordering register you pretty much get served on the spot and then grab your food and find a seat. Must Go!!!",

No bark at all, only a few flakes of pepper on the outside. The meat was under done, still pink, and fairly tough to tear away from the bone. In fact it did not tear away very well at all. Then there was the problem that the ribs really had no real flavor at all. Any trace of smoke flavor was non existent, they tasted under boiled and them exposed to a little grilling for some small but meaningless char. BBQ sauce on the table was likewise horrible. The non spicy one tastes like ketchup with a few herbs in it, the hot one tasted like they added a little tabasco to the first one.   Overall I love the concept and some of their food. When you charge the prices they do and make the claims they make about their food, they have set the bar themselves. The brisket was the only thing really keeping them from a 1 star review. Very nice people, great business model, but unfortunately, overall, the food just does not seem to be worth it.",

You order your food by the pound and then find a picnic table and enjoy.  We ordered the extra moist brisket with a half a loaf of white bread, baby back ribs, sweet corn and potato salad. The brisket was the best and nice juicy ribs. The meat doesn't come with any bbq sauce cause it's really good without the sauce I tried the sissy sauce and that was good with the brisket. Oh my gosh so good. The sweet corn is so good. I just love the BBQ here. I just wish they would open one in the north east area. Will I be back? You bet.",

Everything was surprisingly clean for a DIY, so I can only assume they wipe tables regularly even though I'm not sure I saw anyone doing it. My family enjoyed it a lot.",

I was in a slight rush so didn't really get to check out the country store portion, but this place certainly caters to \"quick food\" considering it's not a sit down restaurant. Get in line, order at the counter. Even grab a beer or soda from the large ice bucket as you maneuver to the counter.  My order of 1/2 chicken, slaw, and a beer came out to around $13? In comparison to other BBQ joints I've been to, this was a steal!   Notes: Good for convenience, and quick Plenty of food, and great pricing Most side dishes were in the fridge before you get to the counter...if you want one, grab one before you get there Slaw was just OK. Nothing special. I was glad it wasn't overly dressed 1/2 chicken was good. Skin was super soggy which was a little sad but overall flavor was fine...had a nice smoke to it. Just watch out for bones.  Their house BBQ is quite tasty and had a nice kick to it They will give you 4 slices of bread with your meal if you'd like Bar with fixens to the side, and they even had ziplock baggies for our to  go orders!  All in all I was pleased.",

I'm one of those people that likes turkey on holidays, but it's not all that exciting of a meat, you know?  Dear lord, that was the most AMAZING turkey I've ever had in my life!  It was moist, tender, smoky and the rub was delicious.  I ended up buying a bottle of the turkey rub to bring home.    In all fairness, I did try other meats too.  The moist brisket and pork loin were also awesome.  We ate 4 meals here in 6 days, that's how good it is.  My tummy is growling as I'm typing this and I'm cursing the fact that I live so far away from this place.",

    "text": "I was told beforehand that Rudy's is amazing and that I had to pay a visit while I was in Arizona.  I think this caused me to set my expectations so high that when I finally did eat at Rudy's, I was expecting to be absolutely blown away.  To be quite honest, I was disappointed and was not all that impressed.  Little Miss BBQ is hands down still the #1 BBQ place in Arizona in my book.  Rudy's is not a difficult place to find since the restaurant is tan, yellow, and red.  The place is spacious with plenty of parking, plenty of outdoor seating as well and indoor seating.  There is a little store inside the place to the left where you can buy the BBQ sauces, candy, wine, Rudy's shirts, drinks, etc.    As far as the actual restaurant goes, if you have never been to Rudy's before, it is basically set up like a school cafeteria.  You get in line to purchase your food at the counter.  While in line and heading toward the counter, you can grab bottled drinks, sides in containers from the fridge, and etc.  Once you have reached the counter, that is where you will order your main dishes and sides.  If you have never been to Rudy's before or are undecided on what to get, feel free to ask for samples!  The customer service that we received at the counter was excellent and very pleasant.  After sampling different items, my bf and I ended up ordering brisket moist, spicy chop with sauce, ribs, jalapeno sausages, and potato salad to share.  All of our food was placed in a plastic tray/crate thingie magig that you normally use to store bottled sodas.    Once you have your food, you go and find yourself a table to sit down and eat.  From here on out, everything is self serve.  There are stations where you can grab napkins and white butcher paper which acts as your \"plate.\"  You just spread it out on the table, place some food on there and feast!    On each of the tables are Rudy's BBQ sauces which are gluten free!  There's a spicy sauce and a mild sauce for the sissies who cannot handle spicy sauces.  The sauce is really called the Sissy sauce!  Don't worry though, the spicy BBQ sauce didn't really have any heat so you should definitely try it out without the fear of burning your tongue off.  The BBQ sauces did not impress me.  It tasted just like any regular BBQ sauce that you can get at a store.  There was nothing special about the sauces.  The brisket moist I'm assuming is supposed to be moist since the word is in the name but it was not moist.  In fact, it was more on the dry side and not tender.  I drowned the brisket in the BBQ sauce just to moisten it up a bit.  This was disappointing considering brisket is the number one item that I order at BBQ joints.  The spicy chop with sauce was good and I think it would taste good in between hamburger buns.  The ribs were okay.  The jalapeno sausages were good flavor wise since I like spicy foods, but once again, the sausages were more on the dry side.  As far as the sides go, the potato salad, coleslaw, and etc. all tasted like average sides that you can buy in large quantities at the store.  Nothing special about the sides.    As mentioned before, it is self serve after you get your food and start eating.  This means that after you are done eating, you have to clean up after yourself before you leave.   Overall, the customer service was excellent, the prices average, and the food was just okay.  I wouldn't come back to Rudy's unless this was the only BBQ joint that was open and I was desperately craving BBQ.  There are way better BBQ places out there that I would go to first.",

The motif of picnic tables and variety of BBQ sauces is a nice option and the simpleness of this place is nice.  I like the nice smoky smell as you walk in and they will give you samples if you want to try something new.  I've recently discovered the pulled pork and sausages which are really moist and juicy.  Can't believe I just used those two words to describe food, but I don't know what else to say.  The ribs are also worth trying and I don't know anywhere else around here where you can order a Shiner Bock off the menu.  Prices are also pretty good.  You can have a filling meal for two for under $30 with drinks.",

Across those five visits I have had the pleasure of having some of the smoked turkey, brisket, pulled pork, new potatoes, cream corn, coleslaw, potato salad, and beans.  The meat has consistently been great - its quite tender!  Personally I love the cream corn because its unique and reminds me of my grandma's back in the day.  Unfortunately, I can't rave about the potato salad though as it seems like regular deli made or the kind sold in the plastic container at the grocery store.  The coleslaw is the exact kind I like, but could use a little more flare - like more horseradish!  All in all I like to eat at Rudy's and I like that its so close to my new home!

Green chile stew is good but probably too spicy for the average palate.  If you're going to eat here, eat here.  Don't take it home, it loses what quality it has the minute you walk out the door.  Service is always good so no problem there.",

    "text": "Since we're remodeling our kitchen we decided to give this place another try last night. My wife has been craving some pulled pork, and usually that's something I would make at home in my smoker. Well she liked the pulled pork sandwich I got her, but that was mainly because she got to use favorite Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy sauce on it. She tried both their sweet and spicy sauces and didn't care for them. That's one good thing about this place is that they don't sauce their meats, so you can put your favorite sauce on it.   I had a half of a Chicken, and a 1/2 pound of the their pork loin. The Chicken was cooked very well. It was nice and juicy, but it had way too much of their dry rub on it. Their rub has a lot of cayenne pepper and coriander in it, and it's got a bit of a bitter taste to it. I typically like very spicy foods, but just not their combination. There was no taste of smoke in the meat at all. I'm guessing that they use oak in the smoker, which doesn't have much of a flavor.   The sliced pork loin had a nice smoke ring on it, but again all you tasted was the rub. There was no smoke flavor at all. The pork was pretty dry, which is common with pork loin because of the lack of fat in the meat. When I smoke pork loins I always brine them first to add flavor, and compensate for the lack of fat.   I still can't say that I like the food here, but it was better than when I tried them just after they opened. I guess that this place is popular among those who don't smoke their own food, and don't know what good smoked meat can taste like. It's certainly popular, because the parking lot at this place is always full. I still prefer Dave's BBQ if I am going to go out for BBQ. They have a better sauce selection, and at least you can taste some smoke in their meats. They also don't overdo the rub on their meat with a strong flavor that some people may not like. That's just my opinion.",

However, I feel like I have to review since I am from Texas, and this AZ location may not know about prime rib...  Sorry guys, I know you're trying hard, but you can't cut 1/2 pound of prime rib with maybe - and I'm being generous here - 80% of which is fat fatty fat-fat. Side note, sorry for making everyone do math, but that equates to maybe 0.40 lbs of fat for the 0.5 lbs of meat....so 0.10 pounds of meat is what I payed for....apparently.   Naturally, I love America, so I love some meat (\\m/), but if you're going to charge by pound for fat only, do it in Missippi or Alabama where no one will notice.",

Rudy's was the 1st time I have ever had pork ribs that have tasted as great as I can get at home. Most restaurants either over-cook, or try to cook the ribs too fast, or whatever that makes them have that crunchy, burnt-like texture. Not this place. My husband and I were beyond impressed.  They also do things a little differently here. It's like being at a family bbq where everyone lines up for their food at an assembly line. You get in line, grab a bottled drink out of the huge ice bucket if you want one, move down further and grab potato salad or pie out of the cooler. Finally you buy your bbq items by weight - just pick out what you want. They give samples as well and don't make you feel like a hassle at all. You then get your condiments and seat yourself. Clean up after yourself is all they ask.  I also wanted to add that they make buttermilk pie. For anyone who hasn't tried this tasty treat, Rudy's makes them better than my mom can - and that's saying a lot.",

We could not eat the most of it. I sent a complaint note thru their website, but they ignored. I am no longer purchasing bbq here.",

We stop by every time we go through Chandler.  We live in Tucson, so it is a treat for us.  And it is right off of I-10.   The people there are very courteous.  They are also extremely helpful.  The place is always clean, and they work really fast.  I am never dissatisfied when we visit.  It isn't as interactive as the San Antonio ones, but it works for the people out here.  I love it... My husband loves the moist brisket and beans.  I love the spicy chop.  My kids love the chicken.  And, my brother said the ribs are awesome.  We always grab some Rudy's sauce to bring home with us.  We don't get the sissy sauce like people we know.  A plus is that the sauce doesn't kill my stomach like most barbeque sauces.",

The building itself is really fun and innovative, I loved the whole feel and atmosphere.  All of the employees were friendly and seemed to be enjoying their jobs, which is always nice to see.    I'm going to keep this short and simple.  Come here for the meat and skimp on the sides.  I liked that they were willing to give you samples of the meat so you could pick what you liked the best; we ended up with both lean and moist beef brisket and pork ribs.  For sides we got corn on the cob, coleslaw and baked beans.  The corn almost ruined the experience for me.  I saw the woman pull a corn on the cob on a stick out of some container and pour two laddles of melted butter over it....sick, but that wasn't even the worst part about it.  Once we sat down to eat I decided to start the meal off with the corn, I took one bite and thought it tasted really odd.  Visually you could see this wasn't fresh.  I had my fiance take a bite of it and he got a really disgusted look on his face, looked at the bottom of the corn and showed me a huge brown ring.  They served ROTTEN corn.  Ugh!  Thankfully the meat was delicious and saved this place from a 1 star review.  The beans and coleslaw were both decent but tasted store bought.",

Paired with the Rudy Beans and a Peach Cobbler that was great. I wish they had Ice Cream for the Cobbler.  While we were there a family of five sat next to us and had a BBQ picnic style meal. The setting is cool with the table layouts. If you enjoy beer (never been one to tip it back) you will enjoy the large beer troff they have. I am a firm believer that the BBQ sauce makes or breaks a place and this was nothing short of Fantastic. They have a spicy and a \"Sissy\" flavor, both very enjoyable. We were offered samples and I had a very difficult time choosing since they were all very good tasting.",

The seating is all picnic tables with bottle top openers and napkin holders all over the walls.   First about the ordering, it is just like ordering at a fast food counter but so far from fast food. We had to stand in a line but getting the food wasn't any longer than what we would experience at a sit down restaurant. You wait in line and can pick your drinks and sides along the way. Once you get to the counter you tell them if you want any hot sides and what kind of meat you want. They get it ready right there as you wait. The food comes out on wax paper and in a crate and the meat is being cut right where you can see it. It is a different format from any other restaurant I have been in but I liked it. The meat is put in front of you on a scale like at a butcher shop but it is already cooked.    I had the pulled pork sandwich and I could tell it was slow cooked to perfection. It doesn't come with BBQ sauce but there are two big jars at your table to add. My husband had the turkey sandwich and it looked like it was cut right off the bone. He said it was the best turkey sandwich he ever had. Nothing is done fancy there, it is all about the meat.   I will go back many more times.",

Gonna miss that back in NY.  The BBQ meats are all fantastic as well, my favorites were the lean brisket, the pulled pork, and the baby back ribs. Was surprised to find the lean brisket to be more flavorful than the moist brisket. Great smoke ring.  Very friendly staff, fun environment that isn't too smokey.

As other reviewers have stated, just trying to get the BBQ \"sause\" out of the bottle is irritating.  Casual is one thing, but I felt like I was eating in a barn somewhere.  Would get turkey or pork for carryout again, but that's about it.",

Was briefed by the server...p/u your sides...pick your meat...tell them how much weight of meat you want...also get unlimited slices of bread (white/wheat).  Boom you got your meal.  So I figured...instead of getting the sandwich...I can just make my own with the bread they gave me.   Liked how they weighed all the meat before you.  1/2lb of brisket didn't seem like a lot in my basket...but seemed liked what everybody was getting in around me. So figured that was enough and if you eat it with their bread it'll fill you up.  Lean Brisket taste good...sauce was good...nothing that wowed me.  Wouldn't drive out of my way to get here.  Average BBQ joint.",

Their sauce is also amazing but it is on the spicy/peppery side so if you're a fan of the sweet bbq sauce, just be warned.   Love their sweet tea and all the beer selection as well!",

My wife wanted to give them another chance.  So here I am.  That alone wouldn't be enough to get a new review out of me, but they apparently addressed the problem I highlighted last time.  This time the brisket had a wonderful smoky flavor.  Not overpowering, but very distinctly present.  This is more like the Rudy's I knew a year or more ago.  I'd say today was a 4-star meal, but I won't give them that for two reasons.  First, inconsistency.  Six months ago their meat had no smoke flavor at all.  Six months before that it did, and today it did.  I'd like more consistency and reliability in the quality of the meal.  And second, there was a coal in my green chili stew.  They tried to say it was just a \"burnt end\".  No, it was a piece of burned wood.  I know the difference.  However, to their credit they offered to replace the stew and gave us a gift card to come back.  I have to give management credit when they try to make something right.  Despite that one bit of wood, their stew really is great.  Perhaps the best thing they do.  Good stuff.",

The cheapy Kraft BQ sauce at the store is better than here. It seems to have to much vinegar in it. The bottles to dispense the BQ sauce are hard to deal with. It's like they don't want you to use their sauce. Maybe that's a good thing. I was in the area and thought I would try it again. But to no surprise still the same.  All the meats are really great but the sauce and extras just don't set the tone for me.  I couldn't eat the beans. The BQ sauce has now upset the stomach. I know a lot of people like many things here but it doesn't cut the mustard with me or rather the sauce.",

Of course that's where all the really good BBQ is, but a bit out of the way for a Tempe boy. None the less I really needed some good BBQ! Googled places near me and a good number came up, but Rudy's had a ton or reviews and high ratings. So, I'm off to Rudy's! It was well worth the drive in the AZ heat! The place is well set up and organized. A good menu with plenty of options. And the staff was very pleasant and helpful! I overheard the gentleman behind the counter helping the couple next to me and he was very courteous, explained how they do things and even offered them samples of a few things. The lady that helped me was super nice too! Anyways, I got a sausage, baby back ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, potato salad and coleslaw. Maybe a little overboard, but it all sounded good and I'm babysitting my dad while mom is out of town Everything was awesome and the portions were huge! The pulled pork sandwich was what I really went there for and it was awesome! Great smoked flavor and their sauce that you get on the side is super good as well! Anyone with a craving for good BBQ here in the valley needs to check out Rudy's!! Even if it's a bit of a drive for you, it's well worth it!!",

After waiting in line, we ordered a bunch of meats including pork ribs, brisket, sausage, creamed corn, potato salad, and a gallon of tea. I stuck with their sissy sauce as I had a marathon to run the next day and didn't want to risk any GI issues during the race. You can eat the meat with bread and pickles. My friends told me that their brisket was good and I can confirm that that was their best item. It was so good that we got back in line to order some more. The rest of the food was pretty decent.  The seating here is picnic style. After ordering your food, you'll need to find a place to sit down. Then grab some paper and napkins before you start eating. Afterwards you bus your own table.",

Well, the location in Chandler doesn't have a gas station, which is fine with me.  I love the employees here.  They put up with all kinds of nonsense from oblivious customers and are always friendly and upbeat.    What it does have is some delicious smoked meat.  And very cold beers.  I think there are some sides, but I can't remember them because we go full-on carnivore when we eat there.    I swung in today during my least favorite time of day, the noon hour, but I was in the area, so I thought I'd get some brisket and sausage to go with some delicious smoked gouda I have at home.  The line was almost to the door, which is to be expected, but then I realized that near the front was a group of almost a dozen people, all together, clogging up the works.    My version of this morning's meeting:  \"Where should we have lunch?\"  11 voices chime in \"RUDY'S!!!!\"  1 voice squeaks out, \"Whataburger.\"  \"OK.  Rudy's it is.  Should we have them cater?\"  \"NO!!!\"  \"Should we call ahead?\"    \"NO!!!\"  \"Should we look at the menu ahead of time and figure out our orders so only one or two people are at the register?\"  \"HELL NO!!\"  \"Should we all go up to the register together, order separately, take all the time in the world, and clog the works up for everybody else?\"  \"YES!!!  Screw those assholes!\"  I think some of that jagoffery I experienced in Nebraska followed me home.  There was some evidence of jagoffery in the parking lot too with a gray pickup and small trailer for a solar panel business taking up FOUR spots during the lunch hour.  Could have done with two.  Nope.  I'm taking four.    Jagoff.",

We tried the pudding they had for dessert banana and chocolate the banana was great !! I thought the music was great  overall I think they need to be aware of the fat and take it off the meat before they send it out !! I should have taken a picture of all the fat that came out of that sandwich it was a lot so I'm not sure if this is an every day occurrence or not but I will try them again  to see !",

That being the case, I am also fairly critical of barbecue restaurants; especially when I have partaken in a feast of awesome barbecue at Rudy's original location off of Boerne Stage Road in San Antonio. This location in Chandler does not miss a beat.  We had the prime rib, moist brisket, and pork ribs. They all had that signature smokey taste and the meat was tender. The pork ribs didn't take much work to get the meat off the bone and the prime rib was on the rare side, just how I like it. Some people prefer to throw that signature sauce all over the place. I choose to poor it into one of their picnic boats and dip my meat in it.   For a side we had their great tasting cream corn. For those of you that scoff at creamed corn, this is not your subpar can of cream corn that you buy off the supermarket shelves. No, this was prepared well and the heavy cream concoction was sweet and, of course, creamy.   We left full and on our way out, we were informed by one of their cheerful and helpful servers that they serve breakfast tacos made to order and some more common variations in a grab-n-go bin. Looks we'll be trying that out tomorrow morning.   One thing that I do miss from the original store that was not carried over to this location is the smell of the smokers that soaks into your clothes and gives you a subtle reminder of the meal you enjoyed earlier that day.",

    "text": "I really really REALLY love Rudy's.   I can't express enough how much I enjoy the service, the food and the overall experience from the moment you shut your car door to opening it back up again.   This location is amazing. I've been here every time I drive up to Phoenix from Tucson and will always continue to do so.   Never be afraid to stop here if you have a chance. Take a moment to read the board of food choices and always ask questions. They're really helpful and super fast at everything. You definitely have to try their bbq sauce (reg. vs sissy) it's such a nice experience.   P.S  Don't forget to sign up on their website a day or so in advance to get 10% off!",

Aside from sustainability, metal is just way easier to eat BBQ with!  Bumped them from 3 to 4 stars. The owner followed up and is looking into the plastic vs metal cutlery. Effort matters on my book, so thank you!  I'd love to bring the team back often if that changes.",

Likes: they offer free samples  Brisket was tasty (I had the sandwich) Pork loin sandwich my boyfriend liked Self serve drinks  Good potato salad Ample dining space  Staff was nice and helpful   Dislikes: Picnic table seating and hard chairs Barbecue sauce (one was very sour and the other a bit spicy rather than tangy) also the bottles they were in were difficult to get the sauce out  Napkins are paper rather than soft  Sides are all a la cart and just sitting in a fridge so they were hard to see.   Overall it wasn't a bad experience however compared to smoking hot barbecue across the street I liked across the street better than this place. Mostly because of the atmosphere in the barbecue sauce to be honest. But if you're looking for a new barbecue place to try out it's at least worth a try for the brisket. And again they had friendly staff.",

When you first enter you stand in line and grab the drinks you want to buy and order your food at the front of the line. There is a huge menu board that prices things by half a pound, but the man working there told us it is completely acceptable to purchase by quarter pound increments as well. We got some turkey, beef, sausages, and a potato salad. Overall things tasted pretty decent. I wasn't wowed by it, but again, you should take my review with a grain of salt since I'm not a huge bbq person. I liked the unique concept where they give you these large crates to hold your food instead of trays and you just spread everything out on a table to eat. You bus your own tables after eating. The environment seemed nice and the restaurant was very clean.",

So we heard the whole East Valley rave of this place. Rudy's stands out with its exceptional service and the amazing meat. With so much confidence that they are not shy in getting you to try out their sample platter of their menu. I call it sample platter because those portions that we got might as well be the appetizer to our meal.   Delen was patient and perky in getting us acquainted for our first visit and showing us what Rudy's has to offer. I'm embarrassed to say that we sampled almost half of their entire menu, and will be back to try more heh. Hands down my favorite by far is their renowned wet brisket and turkey. Turkey was a bit surprising for me at first, but take my word for it and give it a shot.   The place feels very laid back definitely a joint to come chill and relax with your buddies and pals who you don't mind slathering meat juice all over. Worth the hype, definitely worth a visit if your in the area.",

This morning I wanted to kick off a nice Labor Day weekend by taking my youngest to a special breakfast together.  He was skeptical, but I reminded him of his love of savory food.  He LOVED the made-to-order breakfast tacos!  He had a \"crispy\" breakfast taco with bacon, cheese and potato.  It was more than filling for him and it completely changed his mind.  I had 2 breakfast tacos - one crispy with brisket, egg, cheese and potato - the other non-crispy the same way except bacon instead of brisket.  Both were great, though I think I preferred the bacon to the brisket.  I have a feeling my boy will be campaigning me to go back for special breakfasts in the future...",

    "text": "Prologue: My fiancee and I wanted to try something new for one of our recent Saturday evening dinner dates. I had noticed this restaurant several times previously when taking my vehicle for service nearby and so we decided to give it a try.  The Plot: We shared a half-pound of Baby Back Ribs, a half-pound of Turkey Breast, and a half-link of Regular Sausage, along with Potato Salad and Coleslaw.  The Scene: We arrived early on a Saturday evening, which was a good idea because the restaurant got quite busy during the time we were enjoying our meal.  The decor and layout of this restaurant was typical for country BBQ with several picnic tables set out in a large, open space.  The ribs were meaty, tasty, and fall-off-the-bone tender as one would expect.  The turkey was very tender and was sliced from a very good cut of the breast.  The sausage was plump, juicy, and made a great sandwich with the regular BBQ sauce. This was the standout of the meal for me.  The potato salad was a great example of the American style classic.  The condiments bar was well stocked with a nice variety of pickles, peppers, etc.  The Rest of the Story: The meats were warm when we got to our table but it would have been nice if they were still hot. The ribs were good but didn't have the dry rub flavor and texture I like. Next time I would try Pork Ribs instead of Baby Back Ribs. The turkey, though tender, was a little on the dry side. I believe it is possible for smoked turkey to be juicy. The coleslaw was completely unremarkable, I expect we could have done better at the deli counter at our local grocery store.  Epilogue: This is a nice place for families or groups to enjoy some good BBQ.  Photo Design By: Billie Z.",

As soon as you enter the line to order you're greeted by large vessels filled with ice cold beverages that you can grab yourself. From there as you zig zag and near the counter there's slide door fridges with cold sides such as potato salad that you can also grab yourself. Once you get to the counter to place your order, you can see directly behind the cashier are butchers cutting up fresh meat! Unlike other BBQ joints where you order and then have to wait forever to cook, they have everything pre-made and cut to order!   My go to has been the moist brisket with a side of corn and/or chips with 2-4 slices of bread to make myself a delicious little brisket sandwich. From there I get myself some awesome condiments from the condiment bar, seat myself down on the picnic tables and feast my heart out. It's no frills, just good food, good vibes, and good times. Do yourself a favor and check it out!!",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised with the overall vibe of Rudy's. The concept is executed well from start to finish, if you want some bbq and want to feel like you're at a family cookout, this spot will deliver.   When we first walked in we must have clearly looked lost because an employee greeted us and gave us a quick rundown. Everything is al a carte, meats come by the 1/2 pound. You walk by beverages in a glass bottle available for purchase on your way to the front, but they also have traditional soda machines as well.   There is a cooler near the register where you can grab cold sides (coleslaw, potato salad, etc) and desserts. Then you make your way to the register to order your meat and hot sides. They will weigh your meat in front of you on a scale and get everything you need together in a little crate thing. They also ask if you want any white or wheat bread. Service at the register is friendly as well.   After paying you can grab your drinks and they have another little bar area to self serve pickles, onions, etc plus silverware and napkins. It's open seating and most tables are long communal tables. There are sauces placed every so often down the tables for you to enjoy.   As for the food, it's pretty solid bbq. While my girlfriend was disappointed in no mac n cheese option, we grabbed a side of coleslaw, potato salad and corn on the cob. I got a 1/2 pound of pulled pork and she got a 1/2 pound of turkey. They recommend a 1/2 pound of meat per person but I was pretty full. if you get a few sides you could definitely split.   The pulled pork was to be expected, it was tender. The turkey was the best she has tried at any bbq place, not dry and flavorful. I tried both bbq sauces and wasn't impressed though.. this was my letdown of the meal. The sauce is super tangy and I usually can do with a touch more sweet with my bbq. Wasn't awful I've just had better and wasn't a fan.   The coleslaw and potato salad were as expected too. Nothing life changing but good solid sides.   The food is a solid 3.5 and the atmosphere boosts it to a 4. A fun bbq experience and really awesome staff. Bathrooms are nice and clean too. They also have a hand washing station outside the bathrooms if you get crazy trying to eat ribs or something.",

    "text": "Nope, still not as good as Little Miss.  If that's all you want to know, feel free to click off this review.  That said, I found much to love about Rudy's during my first visit here.  I'd known about Rudy's for over a decade thanks to a BBQ feature I'd seen on the Travel Channel way back when.  Once I found out they were opening a location here in the valley, I knew I'd eventually end up here.  Okay, it took awhile, but I'm finally here.  On a Saturday at dinner time, let's sample this taste of Texas.  You'll find Rudy's Chandler location on the north side of Chandler Boulevard, just a few blocks east of the I-10 freeway.  Originally founded in Leon Springs, Texas in 1989, Rudy's now has three dozen barbecue joints around the country.  Including three here in the valley (Gilbert and Goodyear being the other two).  Despite its chain status, Rudy's goes to some pretty good lengths to model their locations after their original.  Simple pits slow cooking the meat, a market style counter up front, a convenience store near the front entrance, and picnic style seating to boot.  The Chandler location can easily hold a couple hundred patrons, though finding a table for myself was fairly easy this go around.  I mentioned to the gal at the counter that this was indeed my first Rudy's visit, and almost immediately she spoiled me with free sample after free sample of food.  I sampled the brisket, the pork, the turkey, the beans, the corn, the green chile stew, and even a sausage.  Afraid she'd make me full before I ordered my meal, I told her I was good and ready to decide.  I got a regular half sausage link, a pulled pork sandwich, corn, beans, their banana pudding dessert, and a fountain drink (refills are free, FYI).  Total cost for all of this food and drink including tax came to a very reasonable $20.    They put all the goodies in my tray (which kinda looks like a soda carrier) and I sat myself down.  The meats were nicely smoked and pretty decent, though somewhat bland without sauce.  Fortunately Rudy's does offer a pair of sauce options.  Their regular sauce and their milder \"Sissy\" sauce.  The regular is on the spicier end, but far more flavorful than the Sissy.  The beans here also have a little bit of a spicy kick so bear that in mind.  With the regular sauce, my pork and sausage were both quite satisfying.  The banana pudding was a nice cooling finish with a mix of bananas, cream, whipped cream, and vanilla wafers to boot.  So again, it's not Little Miss.  None of the meats at Rudy's that I tried stack up to what Scott Holmes and his staff can create (though Rudy's sides can certainly hold their own).  But I kept my expectations tempered and came out pretty happy with my experience.  The portions, the price, and especially the service I received at the front counter were all excellent.  In summary, an affordable family friendly suburban BBQ joint in the same realm as a Famous Dave's.  Take that comparison however you wish.  For southeast valley residents not wanting to drive to Little Miss for lunch and wait for hours, chances are you'll find Rudy's a respectable backup plan.",

Cutters Choice is the way to go if you love both the lean or moist brisket.  I usually order Cutters Choice because there's always one of us that will eat that and then I order extra of whatever is not on special that day. The creamed corn is yummy, as is the green chili stew.  Potatoes are okay.  They are good but nothing special.   Beer selection is alright.  They typically have at least one dark(ish) beer, hard cider option or two, and at least one from area brewery.  Desserts are nothing to get excited about.  I seem to recall there was more whipped topping than actual dessert in the 4 oz cup. Condiment bar has jalapenos and carrots in one tin, sliced onions in another, pickles, and lemons.  Your usual package condiments are stashed by the utensils.  There's white and wheat bread just below and accessible to anyone feeling the need for more.  A huge roll of butcher paper that can be used to wrap up your leftovers or used as a placemat or tablecloth for your family spread. And like the signs say, \"Your Mother is not here, please clean up your own mess!\" So don't make a fool of yourself, demonstrate those basic reading and comprehension skills.",

I had the spicy chop with the potato salad and both were phenomenal and they have the body armor drinks too which are one of my preferred drinks when available. The workers allowed us samples of the turkey which was good the pulled pork which was good and some other cuts which were also good but my mind was settled on the spicy chop after the sample and my friend got the same. I had the bbq spot in the area the day before which was ok....but Rudy's is fire!! I'll definitely be back when I visit from California and I'd say check it out if you haven't",

I went there last week around 12:30- they were giving the breakfast taco's away, that never happens before you wait in line to buy food.  They are generous with the protein and you will discover lunch costs more at McDonald's.  Don't let the long lines fool you - it moves fast!",

You order at the counter and take it to the table. Now if you are not a people person then this is not the place for you. You eat at long tables with everyone else, so be nice and be respectful. Maybe strike up a conversation with the people sitting next to you. It won't hurt, I promise. The BBQ is almost always great as well as the sausage and sauce. I will say that the Rudy's in Texas taste better for some reason but this is pretty good. The atmosphere is great and so is the staff. Will continue to visit this little slice of home here in AZ.",

Having moved here roughly 8 years ago from Texas, my wife and I have been at a loss for \"real\" bbq until Rudy's opened up last week.  It's just as one should expect; brisket is lean and flavorful enough to stand on it's own without the use of sauce.  Thankfully, Rudy's \"sause\" is just an added bonus.  Be sure to choose carefully as Rudy's offers both moist and lean brisket.  The moist will be a bit fattier but no less wonderful.  Service was excellent and prompt for a wait that went out the door.  The fact that there was a group from Houston to our left and Austin to our right at the counter only confirmed what real bbq lovers already know about this wonderful establishment. Menu is the same as Texas locations:  Pork sausage, turkey, brisket, ribs, etc, and  white bread with your meal.  Now please move into Gilbert.",

This concept is great because you have your food right away and can order exactly how much you want! The atmosphere is really cute too! It looks like a barn outside and has picnic tables on the inside. Everything is pretty much self-serve (including cleaning up).

    "text": "Yum. I like Rudy's. I used to eat at Rudy's when I lived in Albuquerque. My favorite meal was smoked turkey and the butter drenched potatoes and it is here in Chandler too. The turkey is tender and a bit smoky, potatoes are perfect and very buttery. My only complaint is the turkey was excessively salty! So much so that I thought it was just a bad night and we went back the very next day. Yep, the very next day.  Let's talk about the atmosphere first. You park in the parking lot and take a deep breath of smoking meat goodness. You walk in and typically get welcomed by someone in the gift shop/country store. Then go stand in line around troughs of drinks, soda and beers, pass by a big fridge full of desserts in small containers. They have many cash registers so the long line will go fast, order off the board, all the typical meats, sides,  AND GREEN CHILE STEW! Get the stew or you will be sad, it is like straight from NM. The real deal. They take your order people in line behind the registers are cutting, slicing, chopping your meat fresh and weighing it out. If you order potatoes they may ask with butter? Um, hell ya. Drown 'em. Do you want sliced white bread? Not me but maybe you do. Pay and stop at the bar for peppers, sauces, napkins, utensils and paper to put down on your table.   Go find a big picnic table to sit on, spread out your paper and dig in. Two sauces on the table, regular with a little bite, and one with a big bite. We tried it all the second visit and enjoyed everything but the turkey was still very, very salty.  I loved the green chile stew and will be back for that but given the choice between Famous Dave's and Rudy's - I would probably choose Dave's. Maybe it's the atmosphere as Rudy's is a bit of work, plastic utensils, no plates and no price break.",

    "text": "They made me like beef brisket. Not just like, but savor it, love it! That alone earned them four stars. The fifth star is because of their PHENOMENALLY friendly service. From before I even walked in they were helpful in holding the door for me (Tip: once you walk in, walk straight to the back of the store to order if you are dining in). They gave me the full run down of the place and how to order.  I had a half dozen free samples, and eventually ordered the spicy chopped beef sandwich, .5lb of burnt ends (lean brisket with the INCREDIBLY good crispy bits on the end. Not on the menu, but they took care of me), a medium Dr. Pepper, and a side of Rudy's beans. They use Holsum brand bread and offer unlimited white or wheat bread. The total was $17 and change. The sandwich was the best BBQ sandwich I've ever had. It's hard to explain in writing how incredible it was. First, there was a lot of it. Second, it set off every flavor receptor in my mouth without overwhelming them. By that I mean it wasn't too spicy, and I believe it's flavored so anyone could enjoy it no matter what their taste preferences. It needed no toppings or sauces. I started out this review talking about the brisket for a reason. Incredible as the spicy chopped pork sandwich was, the lean burnt ends were better. They tore apart perfectly, had almost zero fat, and the fat they did have HELPED rather than hurt the meat by adding an extra punch of flavor without being greasy or chunky. They were moist enough to not need sauce though they did offer two types which I didn't try. I didn't want to spoil the perfection. The beans I didn't like. I tried two bites, then threw them out. I was expecting something more like Bush's baked beans. The bean issue aside, my experience here was incredible and I will most certainly be back.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by a colleague from Albuquerque who is a real foodie. He said it is real BBQ and being from Ireland, this was something I had yet to really experience it turns out.   As I approached the counter the guy behind asked if I had been there before, When I said I hadn't he proceeded to get me some samples of their yummified meats and holy crap did it provide a problem. It was all frickin delicious! I eventually decided to get some turkey, sausage and brisket ( I was very hungry and just out of the gym).   I like the way they put the food in an old country store style plastic basket (the kind fruit and veg gets delivered to small shops in), and you pay by weight!  I got my stuff pretty fast and sat down at one of their \"feeding benches\":). I grabbed some greaseproof paper to eat on and proceeded to stuff my face with the finest smoked meats i have ever eaten! The brisket was unreal, Turkey was better than anything I've ever had but the real winner here was the humble sausage! Whatever spices they use only compliments the obvious high quality meat used, a fact emphasised by the way the sausage is cut and presented, sliced lengthways in half so nothing nasty can hide!   All of this was accompanied by the fittingly unreal BBQ sauce which comes in regular and sissy sauce! Both are equally good and I'll be taking a bottle back to good ole Eire with me!   After I finished I dumped my trash and washed my hand at the huge trough on the wall. No fuss or bs here, order, enjoy, clean up and leave!  The whole experience left me wanting more and excited at the prospect of my next two weeks getting in here as much as possible! I really enjoy the simplicity of the whole thing: smoked meats which are as close to a butchers counter as you can get, pay by weight, complimentary slices of bread with spicy chop w/sauuuuuse, and eating with my hands ( optional, they do provide plastic cutlery)!   Note, not for anyone who is looking for a fancy sit down meal or doesn't like real honest food!   I've been here a number of times since and I have tried most of the stuff on the menu and never been disappointed. Also everyone behind the counter seems to be the same level of very friendly, no bad experiences here!  5 stars only because there isn't anymore!!",

We chose the half chicken which was nice and tender for the most part as well as the baby back ribs which i was not a fan of at all. The potato salad wasn't anything special and made with mustard which ruined it and the coleslaw was mediocre. I didnt feel like i had ordered from a BBQ restaurant at all. I would have much rather preferred  Piggly's at the Fair in Mesa! We did recieve good customer service though being as it was our first time, the cashier was very helpful and provided us with a few samples but we won't be going back.",

Scanned the restaurant; picnic tables, clean and open. OK., awesome I can bring my toddler and not worry about her ruining other peoples' meals. Greeted right away by a lady at the \"country store\". She asked us if have been before which we hadn't, I replied that we needed help (I have a20mo and a 4mo infant in a carrier). She came over to show us the menu, the line to place our orders and let us know that the cashier can give us samples of the meats. Fan-frickin-tabulous.  We figured out our order then went to the counter. ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE.  Miss boring-as-all-get-out brunette. She didn't even look at us. HELLooooo. She wasn't even up at the register, but back about a foot. I asked if they had a kid's menu, she mumbled something incoherent. What??? So 2 registers down was a young man so we passed on miss head in the clouds. As we head to the other register the cashier left. ARGGGGGG! Back to the brunette. I start the order..... turkey sandwich and brisket sandwich..... to which she yells back and a man starts carving. Sandwiches were brought FAST. Then we ordered potato salad (get it yourself from the fridge), corn and new potatoes. She turns and gets the corn and potatoes, meanwhile my sandwiches are getting cold. COLD. She tap-types on her register and then says our total. Excuse me, can I order drinks????? Her bubbly reply (add sarcasm) \"oh yeah\".  We grab napkins and a table, apply the bbq sauce and dig in..... to ice COLD meat sandwiches.  Quick back track to the menu... NO KID's MENU? No mac and cheese? No fries? No cornbread? No green beans? No salad?  The good Turkey was moist and had a good flavor, would have been excellent if warm. Husband said brisket was really really good, but cold.  The bad -Sause sucks, worse sauce I ever tasted. Like water and pepper. They have 2 sauces and both taste the same. One has a ton of pepper, the other has more. -Potato salad, really is potato salad so difficult? -Corn was soggy and had no flavor. -Red potatoes (called NEW POTATOES here) are water logged gross.  The ugly -Napkins on the other side of the restaurant in a dispenser on the wall (bathroom 3-fold paper towel dispenser). -STYROFOAM- THE DEVIL OF THE PLANET.  One star for the country store greeting gal. One star for the turkey.  I'll be back for the turkey and a soda, skip the sides and bring my own sauce.",

The pork samples were very fatty and the pulled pork is very vinegar laden.  Potato salad was decent and standard.  3 bean salad had a vinegar and sugar taste but not much else.  Corn was  typical, over-cooked steam table fare.  The meats were prepared fairly well but the over-powering hickory (I assume) flavor and charred exterior made for a bitter after taste that stayed with me and my wife.  The sides were an after thought as with most places.",

The Smoked turkey it heavenly, love the brisket & jalapeno sausage   For sides we go for the beans and potato salad. The cold slaw is good also but we run out of room:).

The menu is simply placed on the wall with quite a few options, but not too many to make your decision impossible. You're able to try a sample before you order it if you would like as well.   The pulled-pork sandwich I ordered was cooked to perfection and paired with some really buttery and delicious mashed potatoes ( btw, I am a mashed potato fiend).   The staff is friendly and upbeat and their service is quite speedy.   Rudy's would be  a five star for me if it weren't for the picnic benches. I am all for theming your restaurant, however picnic benches are, and always will be, my idea of a bad time. They aren't comfortable and it's also weird because they're connected, like in a cafeteria. If I wanted to sit next to random people, I would go to a sushi bar or something of the sort. I just wanted to sit with my friends and enjoy my meal without the person next to me honing in on my conversations.   All together, though, I do think I will return to Rudy's for some fine pulled-pork.",

My favorite is your moist brisket done perfectly with crispy little ends. That and your ribs, smoked turkey, and chicken and I'm in heaven. Don't let me forget to mention that creamy corn you serve up with the meats. That is tummy-tickling goodness. The set-up here is super easy to navigate as you meander back and forth through the line past the bottled beverages - good beers and sodas to choose from. Step up to the counter and order your meats and sides and they hand it all to you in a wooden crate. You and your party may now sit wherever you darn well please - my son and I love to sit on the patio. Best BBQ in the Chandler/Tempe area so far!",

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is bc of the price; as with ALL BBQ restaurants, BBQ meat is not inexpensive but worth it, especially at Rudys. Compared to other local places or even high end \"boutique\" BBQ places, their prices are still very competitive and the product speaks for itself. The Moist Brisket is personal favorite, as for it \"with black\" and they will custom slice from the dark, rich, burned sides of the smoked brisket. I think one of the best points about Rudys...like other places, they don't nickel and dime you for sauces and condiments. VERY generous !",

There was a sign that said Rudy's and a building that looked just like one in Austin. Living in Boston, we don't have real barbecue, and a real Rudy's would be great.  After the meeting and before heading to the airport I was happy to find out this is the same Rudy's. It was great. The killer was the moist brisket. It was almost sinful. It was juicy, had a good bark, and was not fatty (a difficult mix). The regular brisket was just as good -- it had more of a bark and was still moist. The ribs had an ton of flavor.  If I had to choose, I'd just go for the brisket. They were both insane. And forget the mild sauce; the regular sauce was barely spicy.  If I'm in Austin, it's not Franklins or the Iron Works. In AZ, it's a 5 star.",

The Ribs were equally amazing as was the sauce. Nice job Rudy's for filling in the gap that has been missing in this town.",

    "text": "So frustrated with this place! We were so excited to try it and it has been on our very short list of restaurants to try for months, but my husband and I both work 60 hours a week and rarely have a time where we get off in time where they are open. So on Friday, we were so excited when we got off at 9:30 pm and their website clearly states they are closed at 10:30, so we drove 30 minutes to get there at 10:00 pm. We walked in and the guy says we are closed, it says so on the door. Well, we wouldn't know that it says that on the door because we have never been there before and the website clearly states they close at 10:30 pm, as well as on google. Horrible customer service to reject someone and say the time we close is on the door, when it states it online. They should really fix it online then if they changed it on the door, because who drives all the way there to look at the door for their times. I don't know how to post a screenshot of the times listed on their website, but I have it as proof. Having worked in the customer service industry for years, the better way to handle this after someone telling you they drove 30 minutes because it says online that you close at 10:30 and not at 10:00, would be to apologize and try to remedy the situation such as selling us what they had left (which they would have probably thrown away anyways) or just a plain old fashion apology would have sufficed instead of arguing and saying the time is on the door. Who cares? It's listed online, it's 2017, it's what people rely on is information online.",

    "text": "We decided to try out Rudy's last night, hoping the lines wouldn't be too long since it was still 107F outside.  We lucked out!  There were only about ten people in front of us, so we felt we scored!    I am a big fan of Texas BBQ, namely beef ribs and brisket.  I usually go for the lean brisket and light to no sauce (in True TX form).    Last night we ordered the moist brisket ($12.98/lb), coleslaw and a turkey sandwich ($4.99) for DD.  With three fountain drinks, the price was about $21.  DH also went back and got the banana pudding and the chocolate pudding for DD and himself.  I think he spent about $6 on that.  THE FOOD:  The brisket was DELICIOUS.  It was perfectly smoked and not too fatty for my tastes.  It had a good amount of char on the outer edges, which is my favorite.  The meat stood alone on its own.  Very good sign!  I did try both the Sissy Sauce and the BBQ Sauce.  The BBQ sauce was quite good.    The turkey was smoked, which is not my favorite, but it was pretty good.  DD ate it after making me remove the \"black edges\" off and getting her two slices of bread instead of the bun it came on.  That was fine with me because I put my brisket on the bun with some BBQ sauce and I was a happy camper.  The coleslaw was good.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  It was crunchy and a little reminiscent of the KFC coleslaw, tbh.    We were disappointed that they did not have any mac n cheese.  Mac n Cheese goes great with brisket!!!  DESSERTS: The chocolate pudding was yummy and had an oreo cookie crust at the bottom.    The banana pudding was just okay.  A friend of mine gave me a recipe for banana pudding years ago that is really simple and appears to use the same ingredients, but is far superior.  I wonder if I should share it with Rudy's?!    Overall, we will definitely get Rudy's again.  However, we will probably just order the brisket to go.  We can make the sides for a lot less and I am sure DD would prefer something other than the turkey for dinner.    Yes, that's right, will be back.",

    "text": "First the good:    The sweet tea is great.  When you find sweet tea around here it is usually outrageously sweet, this was not, it was perfectly sweetened and was not too we.  The potato salad was also quite good.    Now the bad:  The way this restaurant is set up is horrible.  It is probably a safe bet that you will spend as long or longer standing in line than you will actually eating.  If you happen to come during an off time, you may only have to wait twenty minutes or so to order your food.  If you show up during a busy period, there is no telling how long you'll be standing in line.  I understand that the food is all pre made and in theory it should be possible to quickly move people through the line and to their seats.  For whatever reason it really does not work in practice.  There has to be a better way.  I get it, Texans love the wax paper thing.  That's great.  Here's the thing; try ordering the prime rib, carry it back to your picnic table and start cutting it up with one of their plastic knives.  If you are anything like me, once your plastic knife has cut through the wax paper and rubbed your steak around on the bare table a couple of times you'll decide the best approach is to just eat the steak with your hands.  Granted, the wax paper and plastic cutlery probably works fine with the rest of the menu, but it doesn't work at all with the prime rib.    Despite all of the issues, I will probably be back.  My wife had the ribs and they were quite good, and I am betting that the brisket is great as well.  The fact is, there just aren't that many good BBQ restaurants in the area.  The prime rib was a bad choice, and that choice is really what lead to the bad experience.  I look forward to a better visit next time.",

My friend from out of state had been telling me about this place for years,  so when they finally opened up the Chandler location I was totally stoked.   On my first visit,  we were a little disappointed with the no plates thing,  but once we dug into the food,  we forgot about that quick.   The potato salad is one of the better sides, and their beans are great too. The brisket (sold by the 1/2 pound) has a smokiness that permeates your senses and makes you want to eat the entire portion by yourself! But don't be selfish,  sharing a little with your dining companion will give you shared stories of BBQ excellence for years to come. And if you happen to have friends the live where there are no Rudy's and keep frothing at the mouth every time you even mention the name,  remind them they will ship brisket anywhere in the USA.   And remember the breakfast tacos! Brisket with egg and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla... Man oh man are they good. Just get there before 9am on the weekends,  otherwise you may miss out.",

First its more like a breakfast burrito its big for a taco. Secondly, it was utterly amazing. Apparently they take the left over brisket and trimmings from the night before, marinate it in BBQ sauce and BAM that's the breakfast taco ingredients. I have been craving another one ever since Friday morning when I had mine.  I cannot wait to go try Rudy's for dinner. I have tried Bobby Q's, Famous Daves, Dickey's, and Brian's up in Cave Creek, this was BY FAR the best I have had in the valley!!   Highly recommended!",

Since moving to Arizona I've had a very difficult time finding BBQ that meets up to my standards... Congratulations to Rudy's for being the first!  I ordered the moist (AKA fatty) brisket, and the jalapeno sausage. The meat was full of flavor, moist as promised, and without a hint of artificial smoke flavoring.  I tried the Rudy's beans and the potato salad on the side; the beans were great, but the potato salad was just OK. To be fair, I'm extremely picky about potato salad. For desert, the banana pudding and the peach cobbler made me feel like I was back home.  A couple of tips:  *Servings are family style so go with at least one friend, or have a huge appetite. *Beer and drinks are served in a bucket, and your food is served in a basket. *There will be families with kids, so be prepared for all that comes with that. *Rudy's provides everything you need to take your left-overs, and everything reheats well.  It's great to know that I can have great BBQ more often than when I go back home to see family! I'll definitely be back!",

Once inside, you know this is going to be good.  This is the BEST BBQ I've ever had!  There is no question about it, this is the go to place for incredible BBQ. We tried the Baby Back ribs, the Moist Brisket, the Pulled Pork sandwich, the Pork Loin sandwich, the Sausage, and the Coleslaw.  Everything was outstanding!  My favorites were the Moist Brisket, Baby Back Ribs and the Sausage.  That is not to say the pork sandwiches were not great because they were, it is just a personal preference.  Rudy's is well organized and able to move a large line of people through to the order and pickup counter very quickly.    When you are in line, you have a responsibility.  That responsibility is to decide what you want before you get to the counter, and please don't hold everyone else up by standing in front of the refrigerators trying to decide which size coleslaw you want.  You will forfeit your place in line.  Once you've ordered and picked up your food; your condiments, self service drinks and wax paper are your next stops before securing your table.  The environment is absolutely \"family fun\"!  At your table you will find two BBQ sauce choices.  One is labeled for sissy's, the other is for...well...everyone else!  There are some great desserts that include some serious chocolate pudding, cobbler, pies and Rice Crispy treats.  If you didn't pick up your dessert when you were in line ordering your meat, no worries, you can buy your favorite treats from the little shop on the left as you first came inside Rudy's and either take it back to your table or home with you for that special late night snack.   There is plenty of parking and Rudy's is well located for easy access off of Chandler Blvd near I-10.  I hope Rudy's will some day consider opening a restaurant in San Diego!  This will be a must stop when visiting in Chandler.",

    "text": "I've used Yelp many times, but never posted a review til now. The food we received from Rudy's BBQ made me sign up for a Yelp account to post because it was so terrible!  After hearing about this place I assumed we would give it a try as we like BBQ and it is close to our house.  It is clearly overrated!  My husband did take out since we have a 2 year old and going out to eat lately is near impossible.  He had to wait in line for at least 20 minutes on a Sunday evening.   We both ordered brisket sandwiches.  When I unwrapped my sandwich it looked great with a lot of meat, that is until I took the bun off to add sauce.  There was so much fat on this sandwich, more fat than actual meat.  I took a picture of it because I was so disgusted.  My husband said that he even asked for extra lean meat.  After pulling out the fat I ate most of the sandwich.  The meat wasn't great, a little dry.  I ended up eating my 2 year old's Costco chicken nuggets which were way better than the sandwich!  We will stick with Joe's BBQ, Tom's BBQ, and Famous Daves!",

    "text": "Rudy's, the place I dragged my wife to for my birthday... if you're hankering for BBQ, straight-up delicious meat, ya gotta check 'em out. That moist brisket... I gotta get it every time. A buddy of mine is hooked on their potato salad, too, and the turkey WHEN IT'S SLICED THINLY... they sometimes cut it thick like a turkey steak, even against his wishes. I don't ever order it, though, cause the \"moist with bark\" (bark is the blackened good stuff on the ends of the brisket) is all I need.  The plastic silverware and eating off of paper, on long tables, is a minor gripe. The line can be a drag. The sides... well, they're OK, but there's not really a \"lite\" option, like fresh veggies or anything, you know? Plus, their desserts, while wrapped like they're homemade, are FULL, literally FULL, of ingredients you can't pronounce, which is a drag... These are the things that keep us from coming here more often. But let's be honest, you go to Rudy's for the meat. I think there's a joke in there somewhere...  One more thing.. they have Big Red soda. I never knew this amazing soft drink before Rudy's, and I get it every time, much to the dismay of my stomach, which turns on me if I get a refill!",

    "text": "Extraordinary, astonishing, sensational, & remarkable food.  Hands down.  My & my gf moved here from San Antonio, Texas to attend ASU in Tempe.  We live in Ahuatukee on the I-10 two exits away.  We used to go to Whataburger all the time.  This must be a Texas obsession, because I BARELY see any around.  Anyway!  The minute we saw the sign where it said ,\"Coming Soon, Rudy's.\" WE BOTH FREAKED OUT, & said, \"Oh My God, Rudy's is coming here!?  Shut the hell up!\"  Then we waited, & waited, & waited some more......  Then one day I see that it is completely built & there are employees walking around the place.  Almost there.  Finally, Grand Opening!  Immediately after getting out of work I go directly to Rudy's to wait in the MASSIVE line snaking around the building.  There must have been more than 100 people in that line easy.  We did not care.  We proudly wore our Rudy's 20th Anniversary shirts that we had from back home.     Former & current Texas residents imagine this:  I used to live literally across the street from the Rudy's that was serving Sea World on US HWY 151.  Yup, right there.   And I went often.  Sometimes even with my sportbiker crew that I rode around with.  Rudy's is the absolute sh**.  My gf & I always talk about how we miss Rudy's & she even had her parents ship her the bottles of Rudy's Sause.  That's how much we loved that place.  So there we are on opening day waiting about 30 to 45 minutes for pure goodness.  Then we get to the front of the line.   I love how the staff yells.  They did that at in San Antonio, too, but these guys are super loud.   Love that.   We did notice that the sides items (coleslaw, potato salad, etc...) are all prepackaged in styrofoam cups in refrigerators which is nice.  They stay cold in there.  Good idea.  Also, we noticed that there was no pickles on the menu.  Rudy's in San Antonio always charged us for pickles that they sliced & served us.  We were very disappointed at first.  We even asked an employee that happened to be from Laredo, TX & she was not aware of the pickles at all.  She might have never gone to Rudy's is why.   Oh well.  Anyway, we get our food in a bottle crate on wax paper, (THIS IS THE WAY IT HAS BEEN DONE IN TEXAS FOR THE LONGEST TIME SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TOUGH!)  All non-Texans just do not get it & they probably never will.  Oh well, their loss if they never go back.   So we start walking to the condiment bar & lo & behold there were the pickles!  Free of charge.  Yay!  We nearly yelled at the girl for telling us she knew of no pickles.  Pickles is something you don't play with when it comes to Rudy's.  You NEED to have pickles with your Rudy's barbeque, people!  No butts about it.  We have a laugh with the girl & the manager about the misunderstanding.  And by the way, that awesome manager, Marcus is the absolute Bomb dot com.  So at last we sit down on the old country benches to eat.  The moment of truth.  I like to refer to this moment as \"P.H.E.\" PURE HEAVENLY EUPHORIA.    Just as others have said, the brisket is tender, the chicken is tasty, the sausage... oh my.   Wonderful sausage links marinated in Godly flavoring.  Another difference here:  They not only give you white bread with your meal, but you now have a choice of enriched wheat bread.  Lovely.    I happen to love the sissy sauce.  I think it's just right for my spicy sensitive  tongue.  One more difference I took notice of.  I used to order the chopped meat back home.  It used to contain a little bit of everything like chicken, pork, & beef.  All mixed in Rudy's Sause.  Not here.  I asked the employees, & they did not know of this of course.  They said they didn't carry it.   Only the pure chopped beef.  That's okay.  Because I love that all the same, regardless.    I can say that the best meal here would be a quarter pound of chopped beef, potato salad, coleslaw, wheat bread, & either a Big Red or a Coke.  PHE all the way, baby.    There's no way Rudy's is getting anything less than five stars.  We missed you Rudy's.  We welcome you back into our lives.  That was only two weeks ago.  We've been back 4 times since then.",

    "text": "First thing people will probably want to know is how long the wait is.  At 11:30, the wait was about 15 minutes, and my gf was already in line at the doorjam of the entrance.  If you get there at 12:30 (when we left), I noticed the line was inside near the breakfast tacos area.    Next off, I don't have any nostalgia from eating at Rudy's from when I was young (I'm from Chicago).  I also recently ate at the Texas BBQ house up in Scottsdale which makes me feel like I'm a bit of a Texas BBQ expert.  Imagine if you watched a bunch of travel documentaries about London.  Two weeks later, you travel to London and get off the plane.  That's how I feel when I walked into Rudy's.  We ordered brisket (moist), turkey, cream of corn, and new potatoes.  The brisket was awesome.  Very moist compared to other BBQ I've had.    The turkey was also not dry at all, and it was well flavored.  Cream of corn was excellent and not too sweet.  The new potatoes were quartered boiled potatoes with butter drenched on them (yes delicious).  You get some bread with your meal and everything comes on wax paper which is supposed to be shiny side up.  I like their condiments area with the different peppers.  Their sweet tea was also great, and I especially liked how it wasn't as cloyingly sweet as I've had at other places.  The only downfall is that I wish their sauces tasted better.  They have their bbq and their sissy.  It's probably a personal preference, but I like a sauce with some major kick to it.  I mixed in the hot sauce into the Rudy's sauce which made it taste better.  I also think the brisket needed some sauce to it.  Even though it was moist, it lacked on salt.  Those reasons aside, I found the food to be the best Texas BBQ I've had.  Long lines may be there, but it moves pretty quickly and gives you time to figure out what you want.  I'll definitely be back here when I have another BBQ kick.",

    "text": "Tried this place out for the first time the other night. It is not a \"sit-down\" restaurant, but a counter service establishment. They serve all meats either by weight or in sandwich form. We did not realized that when we made our initial decision to dine there, but serving by weight is actually pretty useful. It allows for a variety of items to be ordered. You are not tied down to a full meal of just one type of meat. They offer a variety of options such as chicken, pork, beef, turkey, sausage, and even prime rib (although they seem to sell out of the prime rib quickly). Both my fiance and I tried the spicy chopped brisket. Very, very good. I believe that it is their only beef option that is already soaked in BBQ sauce. They serve most, if not all of their meats plain, and allow you to add the BBQ sauce at the table. The spicy chopped brisket was very tender and moist and had a great flavor.  We really only had two major complaints.  1. Only two choices of BBQ sauce  2. Very limited side dish options. No mac & cheese, no mashed potatoes. Unless you like beans, coleslaw, or corn on the cob you are pretty much out of luck. We did try the red potatoes but they were far from stellar. Just boiled red potatoes cubes in a pool of butter. No seasoning.  Overall the main dish was great, but I would pass on the side dishes next time.   I will definitely be back to try out some of their other meats.",

I ordered 1/4 pound of the moist brisket and the original sausage. We got sides of potato salad and coleslaw. Oh, almost forgot, banana pudding. They place everything into a cool crate and it's open seating. They also had bar with other sides including pickles, tomato peppers, jalapenos, etc. Two tasty sauces are on the tables. One a little more spicy and one more vinegary. Both tasty. I prefer the Sissy sauce (more vinegary).   Everything was tasty. Including the sides. Potato salad was great. I'm addicted to the cherry peppers. We will definitely be back. Great place to take big groups and friends.",

I know I went a bit over board getting a few pounds of food, but that's how it's served here. Delicious pulled pork and brisket! Absolutely amazing and they give you all the cheap sliced bread you can eat. So I ended up with a bunch of different combinations of sliders. They have the BBQ sauce on the tables and a small bar with extra accruements. Pickle slices, raw onion, hot peppers, and other little items can keep changing how you experience the BBQ!  The ambience is what I expected. A cross between sports bar like things everywhere and a mess hall. And I love it. I went here to eat a lot of good BBQ. That's what I got and that's what I'll go back for!",

The line was long, but moved quickly - a great sign of good things to come.  I had the brisket sandwich (moist), potato salad and banana pudding while hubby opted for a pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw.  The brisket was out of this world, and my husband was very envious as his pork was \"just okay\".  Neither of us were fond of the potato salad or coleslaw, so that was a bit of a bummer.  I really wish they had baked beans or mac and cheese, but next time I'll try the new potatoes.  The banana pudding though, was divine.  It could rival my grandmother's homemade banana pudding, but we won't tell her that.  I have been thinking about it all day and am even considering stopping on my way home to grab some.  Haha!  Yes it's picnic tables, and no it's not very fancy.  But c'mon folks, it's BBQ, not Ruth's Chris.    It's close to our home, reasonably priced, and tasty so we will definitely be back.  Next time though, hubby will be ordering the brisket.",

Now that they are in Phoenix I am doomed because I will never actually try to smoke brisket at home because I can get it here and it is just as good.  Here is the good and bad with Rudy's. I keep buying the good and stay away from the bad. :)  Good: - Moist Brisket. for those who don't know brisket has two parts, the flat and the point. The flat is lean and the point is more fatty(moist). guess what has more flavor? Yep the moist.  - Turkey. Sweet mother of sea biscuits!!! Best smoked turkey I have ever had. - Smoked potato with moist brisket. They cook the potato in the smoker and then add cheese, your choice of meat(moist brisket is the right answer), sour cream, and butter. (This isn't healthy food so don't eat here every day. Remember moderation is key )  Bad: - The sides... I haven't really found a side that I like. The beans are ok, as is the cream corn and the potato salad. I really could use some Mac and Cheese.  - The sauce... They love the pepper and it shows in their sauce. I have had much better sauces but they will do if you really need them. Hint: Good BBQ shouldn't need sauce.   Now in Texas the Rudy's have Dr. Pepper in glass bottles... This Rudy's would have gotten the 5th star if they had that too.   Either way try the turkey and the brisket with some white bread and go home happy and full. (Full because you remembered to get the potato stuffed with Brisket right?? Good)",

The cream corn is nothing to brag about, it lacks something, just can't put my finger on it. The green chili soup was spicy and would have been better if it was mac n cheese lol (which they don't have) The jalapeno link was good and spicy, but the bbq sauces were alright, the original reminds me of Open Pit BBQ sauce (I like it) and they have a spicy one too.  Service- Cafeteria line, multiple people taking orders, friendly and polite, but felt like a McDonald's of bbq.  Environment- Very large and it has two patios, about five TVs that I saw and then seating is either on a wooden bench or folding chairs. Garage doors for separating area is nice design.

Eventually, I'll escape this hell and make it back home.   I miss everything about Texas.  The friendly people, the trees, grass in front yard, tubing on a river that actually moves, breakfast tacos, and barbeque.  Thank God, two of those things are here now! I had stumbled onto Texas BBQ House and I admit, I loved it, but it's in a sketchy part of town that I'd rather not go to.  (And there's something wrong about eating barbeque out of crates in Scottsdale.)  At one point, my boyfriend and I actually contemplated making the 6 hour drive to El Paso to get some Rudy's.  Luckily, the next weekend a friend told us they were building a Rudy's!  Close to our house!  Down the street from where I was currently working!   I think it was maybe 2 days after it opened before we finally made it down there and it was EXACTLY like walking into Rudy's that's 10 minutes away from my parent's house.  There's country music playing and Blue Bell ice cream and tubs full of every kind of Shiner you could ask for.  It felt like home.  Every time I go, I'm simultaneously elated to feel like I'm back in Texas and depressed to know I'm not.   Everything on the menu is amazing.  I'm a big fan of lean brisket and jalapeno sausage, but seriously, there's nothing on that menu I won't eat.  I always get one of the big tubs of potato salad and that chocolate pudding will change your life.  And, if you go in the morning, there's breakfast tacos!  This is the only place in Arizona that seems to know what a breakfast taco is and serves them!  It's a travesty that we live in a state with flour tortillas, but they refuse to make breakfast tacos or even figure out what they are!   As for the reviewer complaining about the crates and deli paper and *gasp* having to refill their own drink!  This is Rudy's Texas style barbeque.  We're friendly folk and we don't mind sharing a table with strangers.  Texans will just strike up a conversation with the people next to them, or in line with them, or hell, a phone call placed to the wrong number.  If you don't like it, go next door to the unlucky folk who happened to open a barbeque place next door to this gem.   And how can a place that's been open 24 years and opens a new location that looks exactly the same as all of their others be copying a place that opened maybe a year ago?  I do believe Texas BBQ House is copying Rudy's, not the other way around.  Get it right.   Bottom line, if you haven't tried Texas style barbeque, you need to go here.  Forget all the lame reviews from people that don't know better.  Just come and have the best meat of your life.",

    "text": "Maybe I've had too much good BBQ in the Carolina's, Memphis, Texas and Kansas that makes me biased. Picked up a pound of their \"Moist Brisket\" to take home and pair with my own sides. The brisket was average at best.  I have dined in twice at this location because it's very close to where I live and I have high hopes. The price is not commensurate to a restaurant where, you stand in line to order your food, get served in plastic baskets with butcher paper, eat with plasticware and when all done, clean up after yourself.  Yes I have been to original places where that is how it's done and I don't mind at all. As long as the food is outstanding and not mediocre. This Rudy's franchise location has mediocre food at best.  If you want to taste REAL BBQ try Little Miss BBQ on University. Mind you if you don't get there early enough they may be sold out. And you might have to wait quite awhile in line but for the same money or less in most cases you will be rewarded with OUTSTANDING BBQ. And you will never to be able to be a enjoy a place like Rudy's again.",

However, at this location in Chandler, AZ, the Moist was more like brisket jerky.  I was sooooo disappointed :( Sausage and Cream Corn were the saving grace of the meal though!",

One of the best things about this place are the bbq smokers right behind the registers.  You can watch them pull out the meats and cut it right there.   Then they serve it by the 1/2lb. And will serve your BBQ on top of butcher paper.  No fancy plates or bells and whistles.  They know their BBQ will speak for itself.   Seating is almost picnic style as there are just different picnic tables and chairs through out.    Service is always outstanding and prices are more than reasonable.  Definitely recommend coming here if your in the area and even worth the drive if your not.  Also if they haven't sold out of Prime Rib definitely get some as it's one of the best around!!",

If you read my reviews, you will note that the food and the experience are equally important to me.  In this case they both measured up well! The hostess was very gracious to us \"rookies\", explaining the process clearly.  It is best described as organized chaos!  The food is served like a fast food restaurant - walk up counter, walk away with your meal.  But it is anything but fast food. I had the brisket lean (they also offer brisket moist) and found it <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fto.be&s=5776409badfe2d990c53b9366f6a0f058752a0116ce349587452d0874a7d638f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to.be</a> good - not great but I would order it again.  My buddy said the pulled pork was extremely good.  They offer a variety of sauces at the table but don't be afraid - none were particularly fiery. The seating is first come-first serve at long tables - so don't expect private seating, although one section does offer a few picnic tables for 4-6 people. Overall a very enjoyable night with good food and good atmosphere.  One last note - we arrived at 5:45 pm on a Saturday and walked right in.... but by 7 pm the line was out the door and down the sidewalk (with parking equally congested).  Go early!",

The prime rib was dry as was the brisket and the ribs were 4 little ones so you had to get 2 orders just to get any real meat off them.  The coleslaw was plain and when they offer you complimentary bread it comes from a loaf from the bag.  Way too expensive for what you get.  They should either bake some basic bread or have someone bring in some from a bakery.  I will say it's very clean, organized the staff guy who helped us was super nice and helpful!",

The customer service is great, and they will let you sample meats if it's your first time.  They have paper towel rolls at all the tables, but they also have a sink in the dining room to wash your hands in.  I feel like I'm back in Texas when I eat at Rudy's.",

I got a side of their green chili stew - and it's just something I could probably eat every day.  For meats I got the moist brisket and jalapeno hot link - both were on point.    Their house sauce was perfectly spicy and the service was friendly and quick.  So far - this is my favorite BBQ in Arizona!  It doesn't suck that it's not all that far from work either - so I'll be back sooner than later.  I didn't spend any time in the country store, but I will probably be purchasing some of their sauce next time I go!",

Okay, maybe compared to the original location and compared to some  joints in the Hill Country, this place rates four stars, but it is certainly the best BBQ in Arizona.  I know that there are regional disputes and tastes about BBQ and that there are rib and sausage and pork people from Up North.....and DAMMIT, it is the rub NOT the sauce!  If you want Hill Country, South Texas beef brisket, Rudy's is the place and at reasonable prices.  They serve Shiner's!   They make the other stuff too but BBQ really should be brisket and all else is novelty, bar-B-Q flavored food.  It is on Chandler Blvd, just East of the I-10 and worth the drive.  Pity the chump that opened his BBQ place next door, just weeks after Rudy's opened.",

Initially my expectations got crosschecked when I saw the long tables and the folding chairs, when I expected more like a smokehouse feel to my Friday dinner. But shame to those who doesn't try.   It is like a whimsical diner, you grab everything yourself and then you stand in line to see your cashier and chat with him regarding what you possibly could want. You order it all by weight and in our order was baby back ribs, pulled pork and the lean brisket. (The reason for the lean, is that the one they call moist - I call fatty.)  Baby back ribs.  No, I was far from impressed. Yes, they were OK but not all that meaty and I actually make better ones in my smoker. Also, I have serious doubt that these were baby backs.  Pulled pork. Was OK, but nothing spectacular. Very basic.   Brisket. Quite nice actually. But not nice enough to just come here for the brisket.  Sides.  I know it was made on the premises, but it all tasted prefab - I was not impressed.  Nor was i impressed by this do it yourself and eat like an animal kind of place. I can see myself taking foreigners here as a novelty, but as for quality of food and pleasing experience this will not be my choice of place. For kids I can see the lawlessness of playing with your food without silverware and without plates (yes, wax paper straight onto the picnic table) but as an adult I find this not entertaining and just cater to those who wants to rebel against civilization.   I find this place highly overrated!",

It's also super close to IKEA (5 min drive), which is the reason I go to PHX 95% of the time.   The quality is just as good as the Texan counterpart. The lean brisket is flavorful and the chicken is juicy. You almost don't need the sauce but it's so delicious so why not?! My favorite: a 1:1 mixture of both of their sauces. Trust.   All food orders are given with all you can eat white bread. You can also request wheat, for the bbq amateurs out there. White bread is part of the experience people!  Highly recommend this little piece of Texas in Arizona.",

That being said, I did get the same thing both times and am pretty sure I can say I enjoy their Pulled Pork portion and would get it again.  It is moist, soft, and flavorful all on its own, but I do enjoy drizzling some Sissy sauce on it.  I've also had their corn-on-the-cob twice and found it super plain and not even sweet or enjoyable.. totally blah for me with the corn.  They use real butter, though, so if I liked their corn, I'd be a fan of that.  I'll stick to the pulled pork.  On to their BBQ sauce: I am not a big fan of a few things, mainly how they serve the sauce, which is in a large diameter *glass* bottle with a bottle pourer (the kind bartenders used to control the flow of alcohol when pouring)... no bueno. It took me a long while to get a quarter size sauce on to my pork and it was just frustrating.. and the glass makes it non-squeezable.. and the huge bottle makes it heavy to hold while you're waiting for gravity to help you get that little dab of sauce out and on to your meat... yeahhh, it was that annoying.  Here's an idea: make your sauce fresh and then put it in big ass jars than we can either portion out ourselves (like Joe's Real BBQ) or put it in squeezable bottles (like Famous Dave's)... *anything* but giant glass bottles with pourer restrictors on... puhleeeeze!  Their staff is very friendly, the ambiance is very relaxed and totally casual, pic-nic-style seating and, of course, country.  They have a great concept of huge coolers of booze (beer) where you can pick out your beer and put it in a bucket.. they also have sody-pop and sweet tea.    Country music on the speakers.... yummy pulled pork... buckets of cold beer... pic-nic seating.. that's what I enjoyed.",

My coworker and I took other Yelper's advice and got there early (10:45) for a Friday lunch. By the time we left the line was to the door. I got 1/2 lb of moist brisket, potato salad and a root beer. The moist brisket was the best brisket that I have ever had. It just melts in your mouth and the crispy burnt ends are so flavorful with just the right amount of smoke and rub. The rudy's sauce compliments the meat perfectly. I love how the regular sauce is spicy and the mild sauce is \"Sissy\". BBQ sauce should have a nice kick to it. the potato salad tastes like good homemade potato salad. Nothing crazy cause it don't need to be when it's good. I couldn't leave without buying some of their sauce and dry rub to try on a pork butt this weekend. i will be coming back to Rudy's for another round soon. It's legit BBQ!",

Not even a smile or smirk after. I mean wow, do you want me to come behind the cash register and get my own meat if it's too troubling for you to turn around and get the meat I ordered? I love Rudy's but It's hard to see myself coming back if i get treated poorly for ordering food",

It is San Antonio BBQ, for Pete's sake!  The turkey is to die for as is the pulled pork. We love the creamed corn and were pleasantly surprised with the beans on our last visit. We have tasted everything on the menu and it is all great.  Be sure to take a container of the pork green chili stew 'to go' and have it with eggs the next morning. Yummy!",

I have tried the coleslaw, potato salid, cream corn and corn on the cob, all just ok.  But who cares the meats are so good you wont want to waist a single bite on anything else.  So skip them and get more meat you can't go wrong.  The Bannana puddings is very good though.",

The brisket is perfectly cooked, smokey and has a great \"pull\" to it.  The smoked turkey has an incredible spice rub and is super tender.  As for sides - get the creamed corn.  I never liked creamed corn until i had theirs.   The green chili stew is very, very flavorful  My wife normally gets the pulled pork and enjoys it.  The kids like their smoked links.    Only things we would stay away from going forward is the beans and their ribs.  both are ok but way better choices on the menu.  OH and the service, incredible.

I had the Cutter's Choice brisket ($6.19) and a side of Rudy's beans ($2), while my cohort had the pulled pork($5). The brisket was too dry for my taste, and the rub overpowered the smoke flavor. The quality of the meat was ok. The beans were almost all spice and no flavor, My friend's pulled pork was nice and smoky, but had a stringy texture, and was almost waterlogged. Neither of the \"sauses\" seemed to complement the meats, adding an unbalanced tartness to the food  For desert, I tried the peach cobbler, which was disapointing, as well, with what tasted like canned peaches, and a really soggy crust. For the money, there is better Q in town. Probably won't be back here",

    "text": "HOLY AMAZING BBQ! This is the kind of place that makes me think, \"Thank God I'm not a vegetarian!\" The smoked meats are terrific, namely the Brisket (moist) and the Turkey (who knew BBQ could be guiltless?! And SO delicious--only about 200 calories for a half pound), which is so juicy and flavorful it doesn't need sauce. My husband and I did Take-Out so we didn't have to deal with the lines and that went very smoothly...so friendly and helpful was the counter girl that he asked if he could tip her--she said \"not allowed\" (which was cool). We tried a little bit of everything on the side: potato salad was egg/vinegar style (no bacon or onions) and we both enjoyed it. The cream corn was rich and tasty but a bit too sweet for me (wasn't expecting that; almost thought it could be a dessert). The BEST side we tried was the Green Chile Stew which had a kick but not too much. Very nice! For dessert I was just going to taste the Peach Cobbler (I gobbled it all up!) and the banana pudding (with Nilla Wafers and whipped cream, nice but could've used some real banana chunks).  I'm from Jersey so my opinion on Texas BBQ carries very little (if any) weight but I can say that the smoked meats are wonderful and they allow you to put your own sauce on (\"Original\" or \"Sissy\") which I like because sometimes I don't want ANY sauce. I am already planning my next visit! Yay!",

As a Brit in America it really is nice to be shown how BBQ is really done. The moist brisket is ridiculously nice but it is also brilliant that you get the lean option on the menu. I can come here if my friends go and don't feel bad for eating the lean brisket.  My problem when I come here is that I don't have a big enough stomach for all the things I want to eat. The potato salad is gorgeous and the hot sausage is my absolute favourite. I feel that if I ate here more often that I would have some serious health issues as when I leave my stomach is like a beach ball and I come out around 15 lbs heavier than when I went in. This is certainly not a complaint... more of a testament to my complete lack of self control.  This place is always recommended... but for me just when I am extremely hungry.",

The pulled pork is awesome, the sausage...wow.    They use a dry rub method...no sauce.  Sauces are available on the tables, but the meat is scrumptious without any sauce!  We ordered several and shared.  When you come for the first time, they will let you taste each meat...so you know what to order!  Then there are the sides.  Awesome creamed corn, the beans are just perfect.  The potatoes and plain bread didn't thrill me, but no one is perfect.

Smoked turkey is always my favorite, and Rudy's doesn't disappoint, great flavor and juicy.  It was especially good on their smoked baked potato.  Rudy's \"Sause\" is awesome, sweet and spicy with lots of black pepper, honestly my favorite barbecue sauce of all that I've tried, and that's lots!  Good thing they sell their sauce bottled, I had to pick up a few to take on the flight back home!",

I just recently found out they have really cheap breakfast burritos which are also amazing they have tons of different flavors.this place rocks! Def try it out   Also- they have loyalty cups, once you purchase a 2.00$ large you can bring it back and just pay the refill price! cant go wrong with sweet tea!  They have good local beer And their loaded potatoes are a hidden gem on their menu it almost a meal in itself.",

I skipped breakfast and dealt with a growling stomach on an early drive from Flagstaff so I could save my appetite for this BBQ. My god was it worth it. I was wondering how the heck their brisket would be any good if it's smoked ahead (I assumed it would be dry if it had been smoked ahead and was left sitting)but to my pleasant surprise it was very moist and delicious. Their jalapeno sausage is to die for and I loved the pulled pork and ribs. I really like how big the place is and how convenient it is knowing that the food is ready, you just say how much you want. Perfect in my situation as I was hung-over and ready to eat! Can't wait to go back. Some of the best BBQ I have ever had.",

I got the pulled pork sandwich and a four peaks kiltlifter. I was not disappointed in the food at all. My pork was smoked perfectly and moist. I ate it so fast I forgot to take a picture... lol. You can also add toppings like peppers, pickles or onions at a station after you get your food. There are two different bbq sauce. I liked both of them for different reasons. The Bar B Q sauce had a nice kick to it while the Sissy sauce seemed more rich and full bodied. Overall it was a great experience! Oh they also had a little general store at the front that added a cute hometown feel. I'm definitely going back soon. Already craving the sauce writing about it lol.",

The ribs were alright, good seasoning but it didn't blow me away.   The brisket was great though. Really moist with a lot of flavor. They had two sauces to choose from, both of which were alright. We also got a side of potato salad which was pretty good too.  I'll have to come back sometime to try the prime rib if they ever don't run out.",

Depending on what cuts you like, the prices will vary and the better the meat meant the more the price but not by much. They also had the perfect sides to go with your juicy and succulent BBQ. I perfectly enjoyed the brisket moist because the extra fat on that piece added extra flavor. In addition to this, I also got a side of corn on the cob and cole slaw and it made the BBQ all come together. In total, I probably paid ~$15 and I think it was reasonable for what I got. An important thing that all BBQ places need to have are their own special sauces and this place did have that. I always enjoy drenching my cut of meats in those sauces. There wasn't any real downside of Rudy's but I do wish that they offered a variety of meats for a cheaper price. When I come to these types of places, I enjoy sampling different meats because each place has a distinct flavor that shows on their food.",

After walking in, she ate there too.  This chain has excellent grub and damn good sauce.  I bought a bottle of that sauce to send to my buddy in Idaho today.",

These guys ahead of us were talking about keeping their figures, so one mentioned getting a bowl. I listened in on the conversation to figure out what they were talking about. The bowl can be made up of anything you like. The plus side is not tortilla! Woo hoo! At home I could not, would not, do this because the tortilla was so good, but here, not so good and better for me! Brad ordered a brisket bowl and I ordered an egg and brisket bowl. What a treat! We brought, Jeb the next day for his own bowl as well. He had to eat outside, but it was early and not so hot that day! Great breakfast!!!",

She raved about Rudy's so we went and she was right it was delicious! It was attached to the back of a gas station, but hey I already know dive joints have the best grub. Some of the very best smoked BBQ I have ever tasted.  I was sad to leave San Antonio because this BBQ is just that good!  Fast forward we are back in Phoenix and I am discussing BBQ with a friend and talking about Little Miss BBQ opening in Central Phoenix. I haven't been there yet but I'm going. Anyway I bring up the Yelp app to show some of the LMB reviews and someone mentioned Rudy's! I thought are they in Texas, is this the same Rudy? Faster than my fingers could type I found 2 locations in AZ one in Chandler and one in Goodyear. I am in between both of them! Well this one is on my husbands way home from work! Bonus! I had no Idea this was a chain! I never would have thought it was a chain based on my Texas experience. It truly looks and feels like a mom and pop joint!  Well the very next day I sent my husband to get us some Rudy's for dinner!  Brisket moist - this juicy fatty delicious brisket OMG Brisket nirvana!  If you don't like fatty meat don't get the moist cut, just be warned that the lean cut is no where near as moist because of the missing fat.   Turkey - You delicious smoked bird tender and oh so flavorful!  Sausage regular - Smoked to perfection just the right amount of spice nice snap when you bite into it.   Beans - creamy and delicious not sweet more cowboy beans.  Creamed corn - this is so good, whole kernel sweet corn in a creamy sauce. This is a great compliment to their pulled pork!  In short my favorite item is the Brisket moist cut I give it 10 stars*********",

In total, we ordered about 2lbs brisket moist, 1/2lb cutter's choice brisket, 1lb pork ribs, 1lb baby back ribs, cream corn, cole slaw, and potato salad. We ate our first batch of meat in literally 3 minutes!! And had to send someone to go back in line to order more food since we were still hungry. The brisket here is literally nothing you have tried before, the flavor and tenderiness is beyond anything I tried at any other BBQ place. My Dad and older brother first tried this when they were in Texas on a BBQ food tour so when we saw this in Arizona they said we had to try it!",

The brisket: I've been to this location three times. Once the brisket was ok, sort of tender, I actually enjoyed it. Twice the brisket was dry and tough. Really tough, like there is no mistaking this Brisket for tender. Like obviously the cook doesn't care. Also, on my most recent trip I asked for the bark to be left on. They just flipped it upside down and gave it to me with the top lopped off anyway.   Sausage: good enough.  This place isn't horrible. It's ok. I just wish they'd put a little more soul behind the BBQ. BBQ is expensive. It would be nice if they tried to make it worth it to spend the money at Rudys.",

Both types of brisket are full of smokey flavor, yet not over powering. And the lean meat is still super tasty, though not nearly as tender as the moist.  The pulled pork is amazing! Words cannot describe how my mouth is delighted with each bite-full. Simply ... yeah, WoW!  The Chicken, although a small bird ... is surprising tender, well cooked and not dry. How they get the smokey bbq flavor and not a dry bird astounds me!  As for the hospitality, it's no chik-fil a but it's darn close ... got to love southern hospitality",

    "text": "We've been coming here for quite some time and will continue coming back. When the cuts are done just right, you get BBQ that is better than most anything outside the south and midwest. Moist brisket will always be the top pick and recommendation. Good amount of fat, some nice crispness, and a subtle bit of smokiness. Get some coleslaw to go with it as well. And don't be afraid to layer on the sauce, either.  Don't come during peak hours, though; you'll usually get a pretty paltry serving of meat if there's more than 3 customers and the staff goes into food conservation mode. If you get a manager cutting your slices at those hours, prepare for the worst. Come at odd times outside the lunch and dinner rush or else you'll feel underwhelmed by the quantity (not quality) of what's between the bread. That limited time window is why I'm docking a star, because a restaurant should be consistent with the presentation and quantity of their food. Otherwise the meat itself is always stellar. I've been here well over 50 times, more than any other fast food place in the area honestly, so I speak from experience.",

Now he lives near Tucson and whenever he comes up north wants to meet at Rudy's for lunch or dinner. I've been several times with him, other family and friends. Definitely a favorite with the men in the party and big meat eaters. The smoked meats here are really good. The turkey is a little heavy on black pepper, but I still love it.  I first got turned onto the franchise by going to the original restaurant in Albuquerque (they even smoke trout there).  Unfortunately one time at the Chandler location I got the pulled pork sandwich and bit into not 1 but 2 big globs of fat. Eeewe! Now I know pork shoulder has a lot of fat because I make it myself. However they put the sandwich together right there and could see it when they made it. I eat meat, not fat sandwiches! I've been back since but now I stick with the chicken or turkey so I can see what I'm eating and not have it cloaked under a bun.   In the morning they have inexpensive Tex Mex/Cowboy breakfast tacos and burritos. Those of you that need gluten free can request the ingredients in a bowl. Their beans are delicious with eggs, potatoes and cheese! You can customize yours from a list of ingredients. Sometimes after Easter they include ham as one of the picks. Yumm!",

I would suggest to pick up the chomp breakfast taco and accompany it with a side of potato salad and a delicious cream soda from the beverage trough....Just do it, you will not be sorry!   They serve breakfast tacos daily from open till 10 am and you're able to add in items if you get there before 10, if you're after 10 because you slept in, it's still okay because they have the breakfast tacos ready to go in a heater right by the cash register, it will always be a perfect moment for you.",

Whomever is their so called pit master needs to go back to flipping burgers at Whataburger. The brisket was the driest I've ever had. I literally had to drench it in the BBQ sauce just to choke it down. The smoke was great but it was way over cooked. Then there are the baby back ribs. OMG the driest and saltiest ribs ever! I just finished eating and am literally waiting for the taste to completely leave me. Atmosphere is very BBQ and the staff were really nice but the food....oh that food. Absolutely will not be back. How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. Come on America, step your game up and review better!",

If you're dining in, you order your food at the counter. The line can get pretty long, but they have many cashiers and an efficient food serving set-up so the line moves quickly. The line is partitioned by beverages/beverage holders that you can pick up as you're waiting in line. They have the various specialty sodas, pre-cupped wines. You can also purchase a cup from the cashier for fountain beverages. Desserts are available in a refrigerator at the very front of the line. They have the usual meat options including brisket, pork, chicken, sausage. They also have a bunch of sides from which you can choose. Food is ordered by weight and listed pricing was  by 0.5lbs. I ordered few items but only pricing I could remember was $7.15/half pound lean brisket. I thought it was pretty reasonable and remember thinking that about the remainder of the food options. The food itself was was pretty tasty! The brisket was very juicy, and the pulled pork had a very distinct flavor. It was sweet but peppery. I thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the chocolate pudding, banana pudding, and pecan pie. If there was one con to this place, it would be the desserts. I thought they were humdrum in taste.  Seating options are plentiful and well-kept. When a customer left, staff would come shortly after to ensure the table was clean. They also walked around and removed trash during our meal. As we were ordering, the cashiers wiped down the counter between customers and even the food serving counter was repeatedly wiped. I appreciate the attention to cleanliness!  The employees were all extremely helpful and kind. We were acknowledged at every point of our visit, which particularly impressed me since we were there when it was rather busy.",

Brisket, turkey, chicken, sausage, beans etc. you do have a choice of getting the meat sandwiches too. On the way to order, there's a fridge of some grab and go items too.  We got both the regular & jalapeno sausage, half a pound of turkey, half a pound of lean brisket (that was my mistake...go for the moist!!!), some beans, coleslaw, and banana pudding.  When you order, they put all your items in the crate like carton. No fuss, no muss.  To the right of the order counter, they have the condiment, utensils, & napkins setup as well as fountain drink setup plus, of course, sweet tea and unsweetened tea.  Once you get your food & drinks, pick a table and dig in! On the table there are different sauces like the sissy sauce and the original sauce. Both were good but I found the flavor of the BBQ sauce to be a little different from what I'm used to. Did it stop me fr eating it? Nope!  All the food had great flavor. Nothing was bad or mediocre. I especially enjoyed the jalapeno sausage. Would do that again. Back to the brisket....I don't like chunks of fat. I just don't. And being a first time here, I figured the safe bet was to go lean. Naturally, it wasn't as juicy and moist as I'd hope for but it didn't lack in flavor at all. I saw other folks \"moist\" brisket and I'll definitely do that next time!!  Rudy's is a favorite around here. So keep in mind it does and will get crowded depending on when you come!",

Just learned about this AZ location from one of my vendors at work and had to go check them out right away.  Texas BBQ is so much different than what you get in KS, NC, or other areas of this great nation. The big secret is that most of the flavors in TX come from the dry rubs and the hardwood that they use to smoke the meat. You do not need super sweet sauces to cover up this treasure. They use Oak here and it has a stronger flavor profile than many of the other tamer woods used at other places.  I'm a sucker for Brisket and always order some of the Moist cut. It has more fat and is my favorite. They also offer a Leaner cut for those watching their figure. The Jalapeno Sausage is also a special treat and you will surely see it on my plate. They also serve Pork, Ribs, Chicken, Turkey and several tasty sides to go with your meal. They even have Dessert.  Everything here is counter service and you basically walk up and order the meats by the pound. They have all the free fixins that you may need in a large area off to the side. You do not see that much out here. Brings back that good old TX feeling of being back home.  Don't forget to check out the really cool Country Store up front. They serve some very delicious Breakfast Tacos for less than two bucks during the morning rush. Get here early for lunch or at off times to avoid the large crowds. Small nap afterwards may be required. OH YEAH!  5 STARS",

Super good...I even converted my half of the pulled pork sandwich into a sloppy joe-esque sandwich by piling the stew inside. That was heaven on earth especially after a 13 hour roadtrip!  The original sauce is more spicy and the sissy sauce is more sweet. Stick with the original. Rudy's also has this cool trough like storage of their bottled sodas.

Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying True... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a True amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned.",

This Rudy's store is basically the same as those found in Texas but there's no gas station.   The store theme is no-frills \"country\",  the seating is picnic tables.   Wait in line, order at the counter and buy the meats by the pound.   You can order whatever weight you want, so don't feel like you have to buy a whole pound.   I like to get a 1/4 pound lean brisket and 1/4 pound turkey and a side.   You have your choice of complimentary white or wheat bread slices, just tell them how many slices you need.  Your food is placed on butcher's paper (not plates) and is set in a big plastic crate which you take to your table.   Two types of BBQ sauce are located on the tables in large bottles with a shaker top.   The sauce is a peppery ketchup based product.   There's also a condiment bar with pickles, onions, peppers if you want them.   When you're done eating there's a big hand washing station with a metal trough under it (don't accidentally mistake this for a stadium urinal!)      This AZ store has a several new menu additions that I've never seen in the Austin stores:  pulled pork, sandwiches, cobbler, 3 bean salad, and baked potato.    I tried the pulled pork and loved it.     Oh and here's the BIG kicker:  BREAKFAST TACOS in the a.m.!!!!!!    I've sorely missed my beloved breakfast tacos.  Anyone from Texas knows what I'm talking about.    Why the heck nobody does breakfast tacos outside of Texas I'll never understand.  Phoenix just got a little better.",

Otherwise, very disappointed in the food....",

    "text": "I've been going to Rudy's for years while traveling on business in Albuquerque, El Paso, and more recently, Colorado Springs.  It's a place I look forward to anytime.  When I saw they were building a location, I was incredibly excited.    The place is clean (as expected on the first day of business).  I was greeted right away upon showing up.  They had a line at 11am, and I showed up around 2:30, the first time the line didn't extend outside.  They did a great job of making sure the tables were kept clean, etc.  Something that often seems overlooked when a place is packed/busy.  Being their first day open, I was expecting some delays and mistakes, but I think everything went smoothly considering many of the customers were new to the process as well as the employees.  I got what I ordered, quickly and efficiently.  I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket (.53 lb to be exact), some \"new potatoes\" (red potatoes) and corn on the cob.  Had them throw some bread slices in.  They give you a great bottle crate to carry all the food.  It's better than a tray.  They can really pack it in there.  I got a large drink, as I plan to keep the cup and just bring it back for the $.75 refills.  They had fresh iced tea and everything was clean and organized.  I found a table and started eating.  I had just eaten at the Albuquerque location last weekend, but this was amazing.  Tasted as good as usual and I was impressed.    I live in Central Phoenix and head out to the east valley once or twice a week.  I usually always head to Joe's in Gilbert, and will continue to do so occasionally even though I don't think it's as good (Rudy's brisket is better and they have corn on the cob and red potatoes - two things I wish Joe's had) or as consistent.  Given the choice, I'll pick Rudy's, though.  Our other local places don't hold a candle to Rudy's.  They all seem to run about the same price.  I was out of there for $13.98, which is about $1 more than Joes, but you get more food - just enough in fact.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but it's worth it.  I'll just have to make more excuses to be in the area.  I was very surprised to see that someone is opening a BBQ place directly across the street.  I admire the entrepreneurial spirit in this economy, but I'm afraid that they won't stand a chance with a Rudy's around.",

    "text": "BBQ Quest #13 - Rudy's \"Country Store\" and Bar-B-Q - Chandler, AZ. In my quest for the best BBQ joint(s) in AZ, I heard about this place, I had to try it.  As I rolled into the parking lot, I noticed it was packed, so I'm thinking right away, this must be good, but I'm not getting my hopes up yet. From the outside, it looked like a nice little country store.  I walk inside and immediately I'm looking for the smell of smoke - nope not happening. No smoke, from previous experiences, no taste. Oh well, I'm still willing to give them a shot. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice - wooden bench type seating - like you would find at a picnic in the country.   I am greeted right away by a friendly little hostess, \"High how are you? Is this your first time here at Rudy's?\" - Yes, I say, and she began to tell me the process for ordering food - \"You stand in line here and you order at the cashier counter.\" I asked the hostess what type of wood is used. \"Hmm, I don't know\" was the response - and she proceeded to help the next customer in line.  So I get in this serpentine line like being herded like cattle. There is this beverage trough with various kinds of liquids, mostly alcohol, where you grab and hold while waiting in line.  As I'm waiting in line, I notice the prices, from $1.99 to $6.49 for the various cuts of meat. Pretty much keeping up with the other restaurants around the valley I've sampled. I then noticed something that peeked my interest - a sign that said, \"Real Texas BBQ.\" I immediately said, \"hmmmm - I'll be the judge of that.\"  I continue to make my way around the line and I see people carrying these black plastic type of boxes with food in it. I was OK - easy to carry your food and stuff - no plates.   I get up to the counter  and I placed my order: 1/2 pound of lean brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and turkey. I then ask the cashier what type of wood is used. Response - \"I don't know.\" Another person was asked -- response - \"I don't know. I can find out.\" My response - yes please. The other person returned with an answer of \"Oak.\" I asked what else besides Oak. \"Nothing else.\" Ding ding ding ding - I immediately said, \"then this is not real Texas BBQ, you can't say it is.\" One of the biggest staples of wood in Texas is mesquite - I personally use a combination of Hickory and Mesquite -  My order comes, and I leave for home to taste my morsels of goodies.  ANALYSIS: The best part of the meats was the turkey. It had a lot of flavor and was somewhat moist. The sausage was a little spicy and had a good flavor as well. The ribs were a little on the under cooked side and lacked seasoning and smoke flavor. The brisket was a bit dry, a little rare spots, and lacked flavor/seasoning and the oh so famous smoke ring - where's the ring. The pulled pork was very lacking in flavor and it didn't have a very pleasant taste. My family - very picky when it comes to the Q, did not care for the meats very much. They did like the turkey. OVERALL RATING: I'm still searching. But, I would say - go, give it a try and make your own conclusions.",

    "text": "Okay BBQ for Arizona, Mediocre for Everywhere Else  It's receiving 4 stars due the dearth of BBQ joints in the Phoenix metro and people are so desperate for BBQ that this place gets rave reviews. Honestly, I think Honey Bears is far better. There are several flaws with this place. The pulled pork comes with NO BBQ sauce; yes it's served dry and mushy and you have to apply your own. I've never been to a BBQ place where the pulled pork is not served in sauce. The ribs are tiny and the meat does not fall off the bone; the meat is actually quite tough. For pork ribs, the meat is supposed to fall of the bone and be tender and succulent. The baked beans had no flavor.   There is no chicken on the menu, only turkey.  The sauce itself is underwhelming. They seem to be preoccupied with the idea that \"heat\" or spiciness makes for a better sauce. And that couldn't be further from the truth. We are talking about BBQ sauce not salsa. The best sauces have flavor not heat. Their \"sissy\" sauce was actually their better sauce. Their \"original sauce\" has too much crushed red pepper and almost has salsa like undertones.  Finally, the fact that you don't get a container of sauce when you order take-out is bush league. They have these tiny packets of sauce that resemble tiny packets of butter or margarine at a diner.  Any respectable BBQ establishments gives you a container of sauce to go with your food. And unfortunately, you need more than a container since their food is pretty dry and devoid of sauce.   Sorry but Phoenix deserves better.",

We dined with our 2 children on a week night. Overall we felt like the food was comparable to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert & Dickey's BBQ in Mesa. Therefore, for us, we would prefer those other restaurants because they are closer. Also, we love the corn & chocolate chip cookies at Joe's and we love the mac & cheese and free ice cream at Dickey's.  We did enjoy the red cream soda at Rudy's & their take home cups. Ironically, the cups at Dickey's are also take home & Joe's serves red cream soda too.  For those who live in the area I'm sure it is a great place for them. My husband recommends the brisket.

I enjoy cooking BBQ and mine isn't nearly as good. I love that they let you try all the different meats. I generally go with 1/2lb Prime Rib or 1/2 moist brisket. Both are awesome. You pay by the pound so the majority of the time they overshoot the weight, which is fine. Rudys offers two different sauces, I prefer their normal sauce to the sassy sauce. So here's my only knock on Rudys, their sides are kind of weak. I've tried a majority of them and I just don't think any are up to the standard in which they make the BBQ. The BBQ and service are 5 stars all day long. Sides and price of drinks are maybe 2 stars?",

    "text": "Lawd have mercy.  When I moved from NM it I was having BBQ fits as I could not find the smokey goodness I was accustomed to with the 2 Rudy's available to me in Albuquerque.   The quest seemed endless and futile for bbq through the Valley until I found Texas BBQ house (24th St and Rosear).  They are so close for me in many ways (distance and flavor) they help quell that gnawing in the pit of my being for quality Texas style BBQ.  But on one of my last visits they did not have the cobbler or the smoked baked potatoes (so close!).    I split my time between the 2 joints.  If I find myself in the SE valley I stop at Rudy's.  If I need some smoked baked potatoes for my famous smoked baked potato salad I go to Rudy's.   Otherwise it is a toss up.  But I have been willing to make the trek just to get my Rudy's fix.   Other Rudy's musts: -I usually get  a bit of moist and a bit of cutter's choice which is often lean.   -I find the regular smoked sausage to be better than the jalapeno one.   -Their smoked turkey is the best ever.  The chicken is just ok relatively.  [Both make great chicken enchiladas.] -Pork Ribs are better than the Baby Backs IMHO - Try the baked potato loaded with meat at least once.  Great to share or have as 1 filling or 2 (maybe 3 meals relative to your appetite)  - Favorite sides:  Creamed corn, green chile stew and 3 bean salad",

It's so great that I don't see a point of eating lunch on days when I get the tacos. Well cook tortilla with eggs, potatoes, and brisket is a must try! Did I mention it's only 2 bucks per taco? (for 3 toppings)  Do yourself a favor, just come here breakfast, not lunch, because you'll be too full for lunch anyways.",

    "text": "I've had this on my list of places to try for a while now, and since I'm in this part of town for the next few days, I wanted to stop and try it out.  I came here for lunch today, and had a really good time.  Pulling in, I decided to do lunch instead of dinner because I figured it would be a lighter crowd, and to some degree it was. I mean, it wasn't packed, thank goodness, but people were coming in like crazy!  Quite impressive at the heavy flow of traffic for a Saturday lunch hour.  I came in and asked the girl at the front how it works here.  She went through how I stand in line, and place my order at the counter and they make the food while I order.  There's also a HUGE selection of cold beer as you walk through line that's on ice, along with a great selection of cold side items to go with whatever you eat.  I took my time ordering at the register, and felt really comfortable taking my time.  No rush or pressure to \"hurry up\" and I had a lot of questions about their menu.  They had 3 different types of brisket, and I asked what the difference was between all three.  The girl told me that one was lean, one was not, and I forget what the third one was.  You can go with a half pounder type meal, or a smaller sandwich which is what I had wanted.  I went with the Moist Brisket, creamed corn, and a medium drink.  Total bill was just 9 and change.  I got my food and went to take a seat. Everything here is picnic table style, so your going to end up sitting next to strangers, which I'm fine with.  They have BBQ sauce, hot sauce and one or two other items at each end of the picnic tables. If your stuck in the middle, I don't know how you would get the BBQ sauce if its clear at the other end.  The Brisket itself was AWESOME! Most, tender and definitely awesome! I totally loved how it tasted, and everything was just right.  They also have a HUGE hand washing station for when your done eating.  Why do I love this?  First, BBQ is messy! You get your hands kinda gross from the sauce and who wants to go into the bathroom just to wash your hands? They have 4 or 5 different nozzles and the water is nice and warm..soap and towels to! right there out in the open!  I love it.  Here's why I deducted a star. It's going to sound SO DUMB but I think you'll get it. First, there wasn't really any BBQ sauce on the sandwich itself. That's fine because the meat tasted perfect without it.   Normally, at other BBQ places, there's a selection of a few different sauces to choose from if you want to dress your meat with sauce. Rudy's only had 2.  Regular and spicy.  Okay, I'll take that.   Here's the catch. The sauce is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the container! They have this weird nozzle on the sauce container and you must use both hands to get it out...including pounding on the bottom of the bottle and turning it 100% bottoms up!  I know what your thinking...the bottle must be empty, right? NO ITS 100% FULL.  I got so irritated with it, that I just stopped putting sauce on! I want more sauce! Why does it have to be a major project?   Eveyrtime I tried to sauce my sandwich, it became a huge bottle beating project!  Basically, they need better nozzles that let more sauce out so I don't have to break the dam thing to put it on my sandwich! argh!!!!!  Overall, I would 100% recommend this place! GO EAT HERE.  Definitely worth the drive!  They even have a little store in the front where you can buy stuff like BBQ sauce and other stuff for your home too!",

Like the casual atmosphere with sitting on benches, butcher paper and checker table cloth. The prime rib is a big surprise on how good it is, have to order the moist brisket which is so tender, corn on the cob which they pour a ladle of butter on before they put it on your trey. The peach cobbler has to have it served with ice cream also. Overall experience will bring us back again",

The cashier asked me if I wanted Potatoes.  I asked if they were boiled.  She said \"yes,\" so I said \"no thanks.\"  I didn't notice, but she charged me for them anyway.  She put my ribs onto my tray, took my money and I went to a table to eat.  As I looked at my receipt, I saw that she charged me for the Potatoes, but she didn't give them to me.  I looked and saw this particular cashier serving a family of 5 people.  I needed to get going to pick up my wife on time, so I decided I didn't have the time to fight the line to ask for a refund.  I let them keep the money.  Wouldn't be so bad, except that my ribs were the most rubbery ribs I can recall eating.  Chewy like an old tire.  Not that flavorful, either.  Yuk!  I won't be back.",

Picnic table seating only so be sure to make friends with your neighbors.  If you don't like the heat, try the sissy sauce. Highly recommend Rudy's~",

We stopped in on a whim to find a place to eat while driving down Chandler Blvd. We turned the corner onto the side street and had choice of 2 BBQ places there as another place just next door. So happened we turned left and not right into rudys. Never being there caught us off guard as we didn't know the proceedure on the operation of the joint. Watching we caught on winding up to the counter to order we passed many bottle drinks in ice and a refer with sides. In line we made it to the order desk and got our beef or pork order. It doesn't say much about what one orders but it is by the 1/2 lb. or the sandwich. The food was good and  after the cleanup easy as they have a novel wash up sink for those with hands sticky with BBQ sauce.  The 2 of us spend $20 with no drinks. We drink water when out as so much profit is in soda drink which are bad for one anyway. I don't like drinking candybars.",

Last Sunday that craving came and I suggested we try out Rudy's since it was new and buzzin' and just down the street from us.   I ordered a 1/2 lb of the moist brisket and the BF had the jalapeno sausage sandwich. We also got small creamed corn, cole slaw & green chile stew. All that with one beer and a small drink and we paid around $20, not bad. Bread slices are complimentary.  Brisket was super moist and tender! I tried it with the two different sauce and actually preferred the meat alone with no sauce. It was melt in your mouth awesome. Jalapeno sausage was okay, not spicy at all though. Creamed corn was good, not Lawry's good, but I'd order it again. I actually sprinkled a little salt and it tasted better. That's just me, I like the sweet & salty combo. Green chile stew was good also. Not spicy but flavorful. Cole slaw was exactly like KFC's, but that's okay with me 'cause I like KFCs slaw. Bread was the generic supermarket white & wheat bread. I had a bite or two.   Only a week has passed and I'm already craving for some brisket again. This is saying something about the place cause like I've mentioned, BBQ cravings come around once or twice a year for me.",

Rudy's brisket is the best I've ever eaten. Let that sink in ... the best I've ever eaten. Their smoked turkey is life-changing, it's so good. I usually order two meat selections and one of them is usually a hot link. So it's lean brisket and a hot link or pulled pork and a hot link, you get the idea. They have two types of BBQ \"sause\", spicy and the kind my wife likes (sissy sause). Both are good, although I'm partial to the spicy stuff. The dining area is clean, family-style seating at long tables with folding chairs or patio tables on the semi-enclosed \"patio\". There's lots of TVs showing sporting events and C&W music on the speakers (I can't stand C&W, but I'll tolerate it to eat this food). Back to the food - my wife likes their green chili stew and their peach cobbler. The stew is good, but I'm not a cobbler kind of guy. Their breakfast tacos are also really good and inexpensive. We have been eating here for years, and I eat lunch here 2-3 times a month as I work nearby. We have never had a bad experience at Rudy's. If you're thinking about going to the place across the street - don't. Just go to Rudy's. You can thank me later.",

I got so Mad thinking I hit the Jackpot in good ole country boy BBQ   The Brisket was tough the Ribs were fatty  the Sauce taste like BBQ/Spaghetti sauce. If you go here and never ever ever had good real BBQ then you might just like it...  If you are above the Mason Dixon Line... then you might like it....",

    "text": "Ordered baby backs, spare ribs, sausages, and briskets (both lean and fatty ones). If you are a fan of brisket, I would highly recommend this place. Both lean and fatty were great. I prefer fatty ones. Much juicer and tasty for obvious reasons...  Both ribs were great too. I prefer this place over Can't Stop and Joe's BBQ. If you are thinking about ordering those spicy sausages, you can just skip them. Little too dry for me. Get regular one- they are much better.",
