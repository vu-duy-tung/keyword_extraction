    "text": "I wish no stars were an option... I came to the block party and visited this place. It was pretty crowded but thats expected with the block party. We got our drinks at the bar quickly by a brunette bartender who was very nice. We were standing unknowingly by where the bartenders and barbacks enter and exit. My brother was then kicked by a gentleman behind the bar in a leopard costume, and told rudely \"you're still here? still in my fucking way?\" my brother was offended by his actions and the bartender proceeded to shove him in the chest and get security to escort him out. Had the bartender/barback simply told him that he was in the way once we would have moved. I work in the industry and I am more than patient and nice with the rush but this is absolutely unacceptable to talk and/or treat your patrons like this.  After he was escorted out, my other brother and I followed, security proceeded to shove my other brother on the floor and began to drag him out. (he had nothing to do with the prior incident), I told security to please stop and give him a chance to get up, which they did and I picked him up on my own while they watched. In all of this his phone was dropped. I went back to see if they had picked it up and they had it in their hand. I politely asked for it back saying I could call it to prove it was his and the man replied \"$30\". Questioning if he was really asking me to pay him for our personal property he replied \"He was kicked out, thats our policy\" this is when I decided we  will NEVER step foot in your establishment again. Extorting a persons phone? I told the security guard that I would be calling the cops because that is ILLEGAL. after contacting the authority he gave it back. I don't know how you train your employees or if that is really your \"policy\" but this was my first and LAST time there. The men at this place are on a power trip and need to realize legal action can be taken.",

    "text": "Upon walking into hifi I was utterly confused. For one, not a single person said anything about seating ourselves. The bar was filled with scantly dressed waitresses who were aloof to what was going on; half of them didn't know what time brunch ended and the other half didn't really know anything about what was on the menu. When we found a booth we asked for brunch menus, however it took three different employees until we actually got a brunch menu and not a regular menu.  Up until that point I thought I was doomed. It wasn't until we sat and ordered and finally got our food that out experience took a 360 turn for the better.  We ended up with a large, comfy leather booth. The food was delicious, I got the French toast and my friend got a breakfast burrito. We also got alcoholic shakes which were very sweet but good. The DJ started plying music during tv commercials and absolutely killed it.   Overall the experience turned out real good. But due to the poor service, ditsy waitresses and seemingly clueless staff, I give them 3 stars (I would give 3.5 if I could). But pretty delicious food and great DJ for sure.",

I ordered a beer (312 goose island), they said they were changing tap. Come back later after waiting and said it was out. Fine but when I asked what was comparable, they had no idea. We get food and drinks and then the bill. Not only do we get charged for the beer I never received, but also everything else was full price. The sliders were $3 each, which were the normal menu price and they never asked how many we wanted and it's listed on the happy hour menu as \"sliders.\"  I guess it means slider. We were also charged full price for pretzels and when we complained, they begrudgingly gave us a $3 discount. Happy hour is a joke here. It doesn't exist.",

I really do WANT to LOVE this place and I'm thinking that I'll try again on a weekday night instead of late on Saturday.   This place was packed last night and we waited for 10 min or so w/no sight of a server anywhere. I was just about ready to set up my smoke signals/flare gun, and my friend graciously went and got menus and asked at the bar if someone could wait on us.    We ordered the Hummus/Pita and let me tell you - the hummus part was really awesome. However, the pita (they looked like fat steak fries) were overcooked and quite hard. I thought it would be uncouth to just eat hummus w/a spoon so I only had like 3-4 hard pita biscuits. Friend ordered the fries - they were just so-so.  Great job w/the decor! Love all of the screens, ceiling, music, etc. I think Hi-Fi will do well, but need to ramp up their late-night food service, IMO. :)",

The wait staff appeared extremely busy so it was difficult to order anything. There was a DJ blaring music during the commercial breaks of the Philly Eagles game. My friends and I gave up talking within 10 minutes of sitting down because it was so extremely loud in there (is that the point? God I'm old). The food was decent, better than typical bar fare. Reasonably decent beer selection. Will I ever go back? I hope not. Would rather look for food in a trash can than go through that experience again.",

In keeping in line with Old Town, this place isn't very big, but there's tons of seating and booths.  The DJ was playing a funky retro mix, and the overall vibe was good.  Service, however, was not good.  It took an hour to get 3 milkshakes and 6 glasses of water, and we had to ask for the water 3 times.  I don't get what's up with people and water in this state...seriously, this is the desert.  People need to hydrate.  I even tip for water....just bring me a glass, don't make me keep asking.    Needless to say, we decided not to stay.  Although the drinks were good, the service was way too slow.  Next time I think I'll try a weekday...maybe that will be better.",

    "text": "While attending with my girlfriend a few months ago,  I witnessed a few people fall victim to this, testosterone fueled drunken overly packed discriminatory public venue.   The Fire Department has to check this place for max-capacity limitations. Very small, the venue packs drunken testosterone filled spray tanned patrons into a room, so they cant move. This allows the bouncers to antagonize the customers, they dont like. I guess they can kick you out for pushing and fighting and all your doing is walking and trying not to get trampled over.  While standing on the outskirts I noticed girls and waitress fall off the VIP stage, hurting themselves, breaking ankles and splashing drinks on innocent bystanders.  The manager, is a curly head Bryant Gumbel looking tight woad,  with a bill belamy relaxer perm, he really tries to fit in on this side of town and it shows.  He begs for acknowledgement, and everyone see's it.   He talks to the waitress and the young girls that work for them,   like they are his little children, telling them get to work. Stop talking!  Total buzz kill,  he seemed very unprofessional in public.   The way VIP is set up is dangerous, little hostess tight rope on a 8 inch beam, while serving drinks to drunken, Pally D wanna bees .  This place is a lawsuit ready to happen. Especially if a fire or fight breaks out wow, problems!    The hostess fall off the stage and spill drinks on the customers. While the bouncer and the managers walk around as if they are Robo cop, with microphones,that allows them to speak to someone through the ear pieces, all while getting paid a whopping $10.25 an hour!   Please steer clear of this establishment, at least while the current management and staff are in charge. This is not a welcoming environment at all. You will witness, managers and staff intentionally use harassing rhetoric to escalate violence with customers, that are already under the influence. Very confrontational communication styles.Only because the Police are out front.    The interaction with staff is less friendly and more in your face, pushy and antagonizing.    I had a friend get arrested here a few months ago from back east,  oops their mistake, he is a practicing 10 year attorney, they will be changing staff sooner then they think at this location.   Overall this place feels like the wrong side of town. Good luck to you all.",

After being harassed to bring over 50 people for a party bus, instead of the 40 in my original party (which they didn't even have a table big enough for that many people seeing as we were squeezed shoulder to shoulder with no seating room), HI FI provided none of their promised services.  Once we finally got in the club and went to the table where we were supposed to have bottle service that an assistant general manger promised we would have, about 8 bouncers came and started yelling at us and grabbed me and pulled me out of the table, yet they couldn't even tell us why.    After about 45 minutes of trying to figure out what was going on, and having no drinks all night, they tried to have us go to the Mint, one of their sister clubs. After being passed off to 3 different promoters, I literally overheard the manager say to another manager that he had no idea I even had a table. The management obviously has no idea what is going on their own clubs, the bouncers are paid thugs and have no respect for women, and the promoters won't respond if something doesn't go their way.    I still am in disbelief that a bouncer grabbed me and threw me out of my own birthday party and could only say \"you don't belong here, get out, this table doesn't belong to you.\"  I will never go back and neither will my 50 guests.  I hope if people make the horrible decision to go to this bar they don't get harassed and they get what is promised to them.  After reading some of the other reviews I am not at all surprised about the mismanagement.  We probably would have had to pay for drinks we never got (except we never got any service anyways).  This club can't close soon enough. To be honest, the only reason I didn't give this club 1 star is because I wanted this review to hold some weight rather than people just scroll by it.",

I'm trying to write this review in simple words because the people who typically go to this place probably can't read on more than a 5th grade level.    We sat and waited for someone to serve us for 20 minutes, and then asked one of the roided out Scottsdale douchbag bouncers to grab a waitress.  Does he apologize for the wait? Nope.  He walks up and walks away because all he could think about was his next protein shake, his next tattoo (probably a cross or something really cliche like a quote from Corinthians), or how he's going to make another payment on his bmw 3 series that he's leasing while still living at home and trying to impress the very girls that work there.  This is the guy who says \"I know the owner\" everywhere he goes.  This is the guy who has an affliction v-neck.  This is the guy who has friends named Brock and hunter.

He offered me a bottle of champagne or something for 20 more, I refused to spend a penny more, total bill over 1100 including tip.  Lauren Holly came over and gave me a copy of the bill and apologized.  Started walking towards the taxi when I realized that they didn't give me back my card and ID.  Walked back, got it.

    "text": "I am newly 21 and decided to celebrate my 21st birthday here about a month ago. Last night, I went back to HIFI with a friend from home who was visiting, and they questioned my ID. Asked for me to pull up my social media with my birthday and I rightfully did. He then asked for something else with my birthday, like car insurance. CAR INSURANCE. When does someone go to a club with car insurance? Beats me! Told me they didn't have an ID scanner so I would have to call the police to be able to get my ID back and to be let in. 30 minutes later a cop shows up to look at my ID ask me a few questions. Finally tells the bouncer it's me, it's real and then the bouncer tells us we won't be let in because of our attitudes. There was no attitude just a little miffed because I had to waste 45 minutes of my time. Eventually let us in, but will never be returning. Train your bouncers to know how to ID someone, or hmm I don't know, buy an ID scanner?",

There were tons of beautiful women here, the bartenders (some friendly, some not), the go-go dancers, and in the crowd.  I was pleasantly surprised because I'm from the LA area and there are tons of gorgeous women here but I haven't seen anything like the ratio they had here at Hi Fi.  Best part of the night was meeting a lovely girl from Minnesota even though for just briefly.  All in all I had a great weekend and going here was probably the highlight of my weekend.  I would definitely recommend you give this place a try and I would definitely return if I ever was in the area.",

The service isn't always the quickest here, but the staff is very very friendly and they make it worth the wait! Their food is also surprisingly very good for a bar, you would except typical bar food, but it definitely exceeds expectations.",

Then today I came in during the day and was turned around because they didn't consider my \"flip flops\" as \"sandals\" yet there again, guys standing in the outside patio were wearing similar open-toed sandals.   This place is usually really cool spot for drinks and music but the dress code gives bouncers justification to make up stupid reasons up to turn you around. I understand dress standards but when you get down to criticizing what sandals & jeans look like you've hit a low.",

I have read about some reviews before and I was worried that I would be denied access. But surprisingly, the bouncer checked my ID and let me in.   Secondly, the bartenders were friendly and helpful. I went to the bar almost at the same time as another group of people. This one bartender was going to ask me what to drink but realized the other group went first so turned to them (which is perfectly fine). And as she turned away, this other lady immediacy asked me what to order. She got my order quickly and accurately.  Finally, if you are looking for a club scene where drinks and LOUD music gets you high, this is the place. Even though I didn't come with my friends, I still had a great time! I met some nice people, drank, danced until the club started to clear out (which is about 2 am).   I'm sure there were times that the bouncers or bartenders are rude for whatever the reason. But the experience I had was pretty awesome!",

I ordered Papago Orange Blossom beer, my favorite beer in the world. Good start. My wife got a glass of wine, which she nursed for a couple of hours. She also ordered the quinoa salad and some fries. I ordered the bacon Brussels sprouts and buffalo wings.   The salad was very good. It had a good, tangy dressing, plenty of nicely cut veggies and a healthy portion. The fries with spicy aioli were very good too but the order was pretty tiny. My sprouts were very disappointing. They weren't caramelized at all, so they were rather greasy. The wings, which came with very good bleu cheese dip, were lackluster. So my wife ordered good stuff and I did not. Crap.   The meal without drink was $25 plus tip. Not bad but the flavors were subpar.",

We had a few comp drinks and left after a little while....it got crowded and we ran out of room to hang out.  I couldn't judge the service because we didn't stick around long enough and everyone is new.  The bartenders at the bar were fast in filing everyone's order and keeping up with the rush.  We will definitely come back to check it out on a weekend night.  Return Factor - 90%",

Anyways it has a lot of energy - so many conversations, endless interaction, drinking, loud music and apparently you're allowed to dance on top of the sofas, my friend did and was offered a job immediately afterwards. Also, ladies there's tons of men here for whatever reason - and men - there's not enough women here, so go to Maya instead which is literally 10 steps West, tons of gorgeous ladies there. The drinks were good and priced fairly. The tables were really comfortable and they provided indoor as well as outdoor seating - however there isn't a dance floor (now you can see why my friend resorted to dancing on top of the couches). Major flaw. It's basically a gigantic bar/lounge.",

I've gone to this bar many times and never had problems till last night. I was trying to ask the security guy if he was going to move the table and he says yeah and proceedes to push me of the ledge where the VIP tables are at. When he goes to move the table he pushed the guy standing there and they almost started fighting. Throughout the night I continued to see the same security  guy push people around like he owned the place. Not to mention that a lot of the people who work there think they can just push people around. I get that it's a club and you kind of need to be a little aggressive when walking through but you don't have to push people.   Also watch your drink prices. I was told my drink was 8 dollars and when I got the ticket they charged me 9 plus the taxes so it was $9.72. I went on the other side of the bar and ordered the same thing and the lady charged me 8 dollars. I know it's only a dollar but when you have a couple drinks and keep paying that extra buck and tipping they can easily get an extra 20 bucks out of you.  I have no problem paying if the drink is 9 but what it comes down to is the bartenders are over charging for drinks.",

Idk how people found parking, right I was pulled up someone was pulling out, so we got parking spot in front of INTL Night club. There was no line to get in and there was no cover charge. The place was relatively packed. I looked at the pictures in Yelp, which helped me determine my outfit. But the attire ranged from casual to upscale, I found something in the middle. I might consider not wearing heels if I come here again. The music was mostly EDM and Top 40. This place was not really my kind of scene, but I definitely had fun. One thing I did notice was that many of the security guards were very attractive ahahaha. Overall, I would come here again, I really want to try that fish bowl drink that I saw on here and maybe stop by during the day.",

The bartenders actually know how to make a good drink, the music is really good, the type of people this place attracts are definitely more classy than some of the other bars in the area, and they have nice VIP sections that are actually worth paying for.   Its nice, but not so high in that its not fun or overly exclusive.

Maybe it was because there was a dancer's bare ass right in his face dancing on top of the bar - so tacky.

The bartender recommended I try an adult milkshake since I have never been here, she went on explaining what an adult milkshake is and gave me a list of all the different flavors.  I ended up getting the Birthday Cake milkshake, I loved it so much I went back there a second time to get it once more before my vacation ended.",

She always takes care of us every time. A few of the other bartenders are nice as well but nothing over the top.

Is it all at one time the entire time that people are doing their people watch laps?  Let's be real. I'm in Scottsdale. Everyone walking around looks a Kardashian. I just want to stand around and stare. But I can't. Someone is always bumping into me. All this is no longer an issue when you know someone. We ended up meeting with a group of folks who had a VIP section. So instead of being in the walkway where everyone was moving around, we're hanging out, sitting around, observing the action, with bottle service, with someone smoking hot pouring drinks for everyone.  Sadly, I wasn't able to drink but I was able to enjoy the scenery.  Girls were dancing on the bar. They dressed rather scandalous. No complaints. Lots of drunk people in the club. Drinks being spilled. People falling all over the place. Loud music and good tracks from the DJ. Say what you want about Miley Cyrus. The place went lit when her Party in the USA hit came on.  I was never into the club scene but a night like this every once in a while is good for the soul. Even better, is at a place like this.",

    "text": "I had never been to Hi Fi before. I went with a group of friends given that I had heard great things about the place. First of all, the fact that they ID at the door would be more pleasant if the securities wouldn't bend our ID's and review them as if they have never seen an Arizona ID in their lives. They bent my friends ID so bad that the security broke his ID and didn't even have the decency to apologize. He then handed my friend his ID and dropped it before he even got the chance to get the ID from him. Security guy then moved on to the next person without even acknowledging that 1. he had broke the ID & 2. he dropped the ID. So we finally get in after the security reviews our IDs, I kid you not it took him a minimum of 5 minutes to review the IDs. We get our table, we have to go look for a waitress to help, she says she will be with us in a bit. It takes her 20 minutes to show up, we order our food. She gets it wrong, we let it go. We ordered drinks for all of his, the waitress went missing for about 30 minutes, comes back without our drinks, and I asked her for water. She takes my cup and never comes back with my water nor our drinks we had asked for. A busser helped us more than she did. She passes by and we ask her about our drinks, completely ignores us & starts talking on her headset. She stops talking and says \"sorry they were talking\" and she walks away. At this point we thought she was going to bring us our drinks but nothing, and I am still without water. We ended up asking for the check because clearly we weren't gonna get the drinks. She brings us the check and we asked her about the drinks and she says she forgot. Needless to say, this lady did not deserve a tip but we left her 10% which I thought was too much for the very little work she had done. We ended up staying a bit longer just chatting and the manager comes out to ask about the service, we didn't bring up anything negative about the young girl and he proceeds to complain about the tip we left her. He said that considering her work she should've gotten more from us, and that was when we explained that no she didn't deserve even the 10%. Manager was upset but we were more. Do not go here if you expect decent customer service.",

Would def recommend this place to anyone, great music and good drinks!",

    "text": "Our group of 8 people were looking for a place where we could watch and hear the NFL football games on a Sunday afternoon. When I asked if we could do that, I was told that we would be able to do that. We sat down at a table that accommodated our group and were able to watch and hear several games on TV's and projection screens all around us, had some good food and drinks, and our server was also very good. However, at the end of the 1st quarter, the sound of the game was turned off and a DJ began blaring \"Club\" music so loud that we could not communicate. Needless to say, we were upset and asked the Manager if he would turn the volume of the football game back on and ask the DJ to stop blaring music until after the game ended. Others around us felt the same way. The Manager informed us that he was not empowered to do that and that the DJ had already been paid and comes on every Sunday at 3:00pm. If that was the case, then why tell us up front that we could watch and hear the entire game? Why not tell us that a DJ would start blaring \"Club\" type music starting at 3:00? An example of mis-setting customer expectations and then compounding the problem by mis-managing them. When we informed the Manager that we would be leaving immediately, we received our bill with an included 20% gratuity. Now, I have seen gratuities of 15-18% automatically added for parties of 6 or more, but have never seen 20%. We paid it and left. Hi Fi Kitchen and Cocktails not only lost the rest of our business that day, but I suspect others around us as well, and we don't intend to return. If you're looking for a \"Club\" type atmosphere that plays music so loud that you won't be able to talk to anyone around you, then this may be the place for you. Otherwise, our experience was extremely poor and not only would I not recommend this venue, I would recommend you stay away from it based on our experience and the poor manner in which it was handled.",

I even told him the only money I had on me at the time besides my debit card was a $5 bill, he wasn't accepting it.Worst part about it was he was letting in both genders for free before us.  After I told him what he was doing was wrong,and I wanted to speak to his manger,he called for security and got 3 security guards on roids to shove me all at the same time, until i was at least 100ft from the place. I wouldn't waste my time or energy to go to place like this. Totally unprofessional how the bouncer handled the whole situation.I usually don't go out of my way to write a bad review on a place, but I couldn't help my self in this particular case.Theres so many better choices you can go to bar wise in old town than this place.",

But this time around could be the worse ever experience .. We got in fairly fast an headed towards a table, a friend had rented .While being helped up by the security guard who was watching the table we began to dance... An a short time later, I was forcefully grabbed an yanked off where I was dancing. When I go to look up it was the same security guard who had helped me up.. I was caught by surprise . Since a ex boyfriend was at the same table as I ,an he was not happy he had the security  guard forcefully remove me without any warning . Then as I go to reach for my purse calmly since I was removed so fast.. I was yelled at that I was not to come near the table an then he shoved me down the stairs an shoved my purse into my chest  . I was in total shock with how I was treated . I then went to the patio , to collect my self an stop crying !!! My friends came to see if I was all right .. They where told they could stay at the table but I could not. We decided  to leave  an I  then asked the  same security guard why he so rudely handled the situation. An his comment to me was he could do what ever the fuck he wanted ... I then went up to a host an asked to see a manager to talk about what had happened .Waited for 20 minutes an no manager came to talk to me ...So i decided to leave .. I now have a bruise on my arm where the security guard yanked me from the table.. I am now waiting for  a call back from Hi Fi . Which has not happened yet !!!!",

(It didn't seem like there were any other places nearby that were open beside some sports bar). We arrived around 10pm and there were already plenty revelers. No cover, woohhoo. I'm from southern California and it reminded me of Hermosa Beach...Sharkeez Hermosa or American Junkie aka douchebag heaven (made me LOL to read the other reviewers). The DJ played an eclectic music selection for all dancing types. The layout is well designed with indoor booths, outdoor seating and flat screens, an impressive pin-up mural above the bar and decent sized dancefloor. The right wall with subwoofers was pretty sweet. I know where to party if I visit Scottsdale again.",

    "text": "Well I really cant say if I like the place or not because I (for some reason) wasn't allowed in.  So I went to this place on a Saturday after work to attend a friends pre bachelor party festivities.  Now look I understand how most of the bars/clubs in Scottsdale have a \"strict dress code\" so I purposely brought 2 totally different outfits to make sure I wouldn't have a problem getting in (i thought).  So I get in the area of the place, had to pay $10 for valet (plus tip) got in line and made sure to observe the other males dress to determine if I should be able to get in or if i would have to make a trip to the car.  I saw guys ahead of me getting in with flip flops, hats, ripped jeans, tank tops, so I'm thinking \"Damn i might have over dressed\".  I was wearing a short sleeve button up shirt some clean jeans and a pair of clean air force one's.  So I get my turn at the door and was ABSOLUTELY SURE i wouldn't have any issues getting in.  WRONG!!!  I get to the bouncer, he looks me up and down and say he couldn't let me in...HUH?!?!?  I asked why and he stated \"your shoes\" and un hooked the rope thing and said get out the line.  I was shocked because I watched others getting in with similar shoes and even worst and couldn't believe he said that.  So he stopped talking to me and definitely had a problem with me pointing out people inside and out wearing similar things and he had no problem with letting them in.  So i called my friends (who were already inside) let them know i wasn't going to be able to get in and they came out so we could go somewhere else but before we left i asked another bouncer if I could just go and change my shoes so not to ruin the night and i was told \"No! Once your told you cant get in that's it no second chance\".  \"F\" this place!  I'm glad I wasn't let in it only pushed me to a better bar.  Wish i had read the reviews on here earlier that way we would have never went at all!    By the way \"HI FI\" I work in customer relations for one of the biggest call centers in Scottsdale and I will be sure to tell every not to go there anymore.",

I scrolled some of the reviews and I am a firm believer that you get the energy back that you put out. This is a nightclub environment and I can tell you from witnessing and from hearing the stories the staff has to put up with a ton of knuckleheads.

The bride tribe was clearly over served and attempted to get the innocent patrons kicked out of the bar. The patrons were asked to move to the patio to avoid conflict with the bride tribe. Moments later the tribe was then kicked out of the bar for being over served and rowdy to staff and other innocent patrons. The bride tribe then continue to hop over the fence in the patio and physically assault the two girls. Swinging and running away. There was an off duty police officer with the victims.  He was the only one who attempted to catch the bride tribe. Meanwhile the girls were shaken up and alone. No staff or managers came to their side. The manager drew asked if they would move away from the bar bc they were making a scene. Drew-the manager- was inconsiderate and selfish. Safety is not an option here. Drew needs a different job bc he has no idea how to be a manager let alone respectful to his patrons.",

Needless to say the night I end up going back and actually getting bottle service was a mess.  We called in advance and requested a table on the dance floor, and when we got there they tried to put us in an awkward corner area and insisted it was the dance floor (which I know it wasn't).  We were also greeted by their trashy VIP host.  She was very rude and extremely unfriendly.  We told her that the table she was giving us was not what we had requested and she made us wait 20 minutes for a new table.  She had also originally told us on the phone that it was a two bottle minimum which would run about $600, which we were ok with. Once we got there and told her the table was all wrong, she gave us a table on the dance floor like we had originally requested.  This change, which was all her fault for misleading us, ended up costing us $1200.  I will definitely not be going back.",

We came here on Sunday to watch football with the rest of the crowd, and to all of our surprise, they had a DJ come on at 3pm and start blasting music on a richter scale that would make Daft Punk cringe. Everyone at the bar was verbally pissed and upset, but to everyone's surprise the manager refused to turn the music off, let alone down at all! Even with half the bar begging for it... The manager claimed that he had no authority because they already paid the DJ. Terrible customer service. They lost more money from the people that left (and the horrible reviews to follow) then they ever would have if they had cut the DJ off. It's not like the DJ brought anyone in either, the place was packed with football fans before he ever took the stage. A good manager would have recognized this. Multiple tables ended up leaving, including ourselves after the 1st quarter of the afternoon games because the sound and atmosphere was unbearable.   All in all, it was a horrible experience, and the manager was completely inept and useless. He refused to do anything and snubbed us off as if we were crazy for even suggesting the idea. Apparently they have a house DJ come on every day at 3pm. I can't stress enough how terrible of an idea this is. It's not a club, especially at 3 in the afternoon. There's no dancing space, and the atmosphere doesn't match at all. I have no idea what vibe they're trying to go for, but they missed the beat completely. Maybe they're trying to fit in with the old town club scene, why on a Sunday afternoon is beyond me. We will never come back here, and I would highly recommend no one else does either. (That is, unless you're looking to make your ears bleed).   It was all very unfortunate because they had huge projector screens and a good amount of tv's, which was why everyone came in the first place. The management here needs to figure out what the hell they want to be and stick to it, because whatever they're doing sucks something awful.",

We asked to see the contract stating a second bottle needed  to be purchased, and he said he didn't need one because he had a popular bar with people who wanted to spend more money than us. He then had security escort us out of the bar. I, in the nicest way possible, explained that we bought a $400 bottle of Kettle 1 with no contract stating we had to buy two bottles, and he still had security kick us out and said we could \"wait in line to get into his bar from now on.\" Never been so disrespected before, and never going back to Hi-Fi",

We were out for a Sunday funday it was myself, him & 5 other girls in our group. Us girls went first had our IDs checked no problem then it got to him & they told him he could not come in because he was wearing Jordan's. When I heard, I went to the Door Guy/Security & mentioned to him there was a white guy sitting at a table/couch that was wearing Jordan's that they had let in, so why couldn't my friend who is Black. The security guard didn't say anything about it and repeated he couldn't come in because of his shoes. So we all left. I have not been back since..this was so disrespectful, my friend was dressed in nice jeans, nice shirt & he even showed his Military ID but I hear this happens a lot not only at Hi-Fi & other bars/clubs in Scottsdale.",

Should not be charging people extra money for things they didn't sign off on!!!!! Now I have to file a claim. Such a disappointment. I have so many friends who work here and so many that like to come out. I am telling them all never to come here. Screw a place that steals from customers. What a sad joke so desperate you charge customers extra. I was forced to put one star in order to post this. This place could rot in hell for all I care",

I ordered a beer and it was this girls only order at the time and she delivered it to the waitress pass. So I sat with out a beverage for about 5 minutes while it sat across the bar from me. All while she picked at her zebra tights that seemed to bother her backside all night. She finally returned to me and asked if I had ordered yet... I was like yes you took my order and put my beer over on the other side of the bar. She apologized and got the beer for me.  The bar is awesome. Good music, tv's, patio, and good draft beer selection.  Another girl then proceeded to try and change the channels on the tv's at the bar. She turned one off the suns game to a Spanish karaoke and another game to a knife info-mercial. She couldn't figure it out and kept pointing the remote up to the security cameras at the bar. She eventually gave up and turned the tv off. I just wish I had recorded this for YouTube.  Overall a cool new place and will be back for a drink and some laughs I'm sure.",

It's always consistently busy, the music is good, the food is GREAT (for bar-style), and the drinks are strong and reasonably priced compared to the rest of the Scottsdale scene. If you do plan on going to HiFi on the weekends, definitely try to get there earlier in the night (10pm-11pm) before it gets too busy. The line is always long past 11:30pm. The door staff and staff in general are friendly and strive to provide the best service possible. Overall, I highly recommend this place.",

Issues:   Girls dressed like Hooter servers. The guys that worked there was clothed from head to toe. Make it equal in the dress code. If it's not okay to put the men in short shorts, the woman shouldn't be subjected to that BS outfit.   Parking was hard to find.  Bathroom wasn't super clean   Sitting outside should have a warning. You are pretty much on the street. This location is party central with a bunch of drunks. We sat outside and a couple walking by picked a fight with us, while we tried to sit and enjoy our time. This is in no means the restaurants fault, just a heads up. Someone can reach over the rail from the street and grab you.  If I visit Arizona again, I'd totally go back to this bar/restaurant. Though, only during the day.",

They tried to explain the situation (with little success) - the service was unacceptable and given the low attendance pretty ridiculous. Hopefully they understand that next time there's a girl who wants to order 9+ shots for the group she is with, she will be getting ignored!!",

First time at Casa Amigos and really was enjoying myself, until I saw what happened the next morning.  I went and bought 3 Bud Lights for myself and two co-workers.  They ran my card and gave me a card back.  Fast forward to the end of the night, I go to use my Chase Freedom at a different bar and it is declining.  It ends up being a different person's card, which I did not notice until this point.  I then check my Chase account to learn that over $2,000 has been charged to my account, on my card that was swapped out.    A week later, I get a DM on Instagram from a gentleman who somehow has my card and was returning it.  He ends up telling me the exact same thing happened to him and he had to cancel his card.  This time, his card was swapped at Hi-Fi and he was given my card, which had long been cancelled.  They are swapping out cards of unsuspecting customers and charging on the stolen cards.  There are some extremely criminal employees here who will clear out your accounts.  It looks as though the bad employees work at both Hi-Fi and Casa Amigos.",

The place was almost empty except for what appeared to be a birthday party. The other bars/clubs nearby were hopping. We should've taken that as the sign it was. After we sat down, we waited five minutes for a server to come to the table. Nobody to be found. We went to the bar to order drinks and a little food. It took the bartender five minutes to even make eye contact. The place was 90% empty. We got some drinks and ordered an appetizer (pretzels). It took 40 minutes for the appetizer to come out. When the food was brought out, the server left before we could order another drink. Literally dropped the food and ran. Another server walked by us to pick up a check at another table but never asked if we were interested in another round (with empty glasses on the table...). When we decided to go, we had to close our check at the bar. It took 14 minutes (we timed it) of STANDING AT THE BAR before the bartender would close our tab. Mind you, this place was not busy. If the credit card wasn't behind the bar, we would've left cash and gotten the hell out of there.   The few other patrons there were extremely drunk and disorderly. We saw a girl with her top falling off get in multiple fights and still not get kicked out. Instead, they kept serving her. Then there were the guys smoking weed. I mean, whatever, but it was a little much for a Sunday afternoon.",

After four hours and a $300 tab my party of 8 people got booted from our table for someone who was willing to pay $600 and bought a bottle!  We could have easily spent that much on beer but because we didn't buy a bottle we weren't worthy. On top of that I was willing to pay the $100 reservation fee so we wouldn't lose our seats and I was told I didn't have to worry about it, that we were fine!  Then the kicker we hadn't even vacated our table yet and they were already clearing our stuff out and putting the other party in place! All I can say is BS. Wish I hadn't wasted my hard earned money there.",

The demeanor of our server was horrible and made us feel as if we were imposing anytime we asked for something - terrible attitude. Seems like the staff there has the mentality that they're doing you some huge favor by simply doing their job. Just about any other place in old town is better.

It is VERY packed after 10 so be aware that you might want to go here first on your night of bar hopping. The music is always on point and the drinks are always strong.   I never have a problem getting in, mainly because my boyfriend knows all of the bouncers and the GM. We always walk right in! However, this past weekend that all changed. It was the Saturday of the Phoenix Open (huge golf tournament) and my boyfriends 30th birthday, two HUGE events for us. I can understand that most bar/clubs in Scottsdale try and maintain a guy/girl ratio and with the open in town there were about 15 guys to every 1 girl.... Long story short, we actually got TURNED AWAY because we had 1 too many guys in our group... let me tell you how the door guy was very apologetic explaining this ratio, which I understand but when you let in a group of ugly, over weight, fat chicks (yes, that is shallow but this is Scottsdale) instead of someone who has spent tons of money (and were about to do it again) at your bar is terrible. We went to El Hefe and walked straight in, no issues there.  I will forever look at HiFi differently after that. Used to be a 5 star bar, now a 3...",

The most recent was in a larger group for watching the fights at hifi. Our server disappeared a lot due to having to change outfits and then a new girl took over in the middle. We ended up ordering from the bar a lot and paying cash rather than waiting. When the bill comes at the end, we are charged for the items that were ordered separately and already paid for and other items that we never ordered. The server can't even recall who ordered what at that point. The original server stands her ground for the bill even though well over 50% of the time she wasn't there and we all end up over paying just so we can finally leave the place. Not sure what happened or the issue, maybe not knowing how to handle larger groups and tabs, or not changing to a new themed outfit in the middle of a shift or switching off to a different person in the middle may have helped. But one thing is for certain, if forced to go to one of these places: pay cash and pay as you go.",

Little did I know that about 10 minutes into being there it would turn into a crazy drunk fest that bordered on obscene.  I sat at the bar with my husband and ordered a drink. The staff was awesome and incredibly nice. A group of five people came in and a couple of minutes later one of the girls in the group, who was wasted beyond belief, was actually climbing on the speakers on the back wall. She was so drunk that she was a liability at best for this place. She proceeded to do a photo shoot with her friends for the next 30 minutes on the wall of speakers. Yes, she climbed up on the booths and was standing on tables doing a photo shoot with her friends. Did I mention she pulled her skirt up to get it out of the way so she could get on the tables? Some of the poses were pretty gross. Nothing you want to see when you are having a relaxing drink on a Saturday afternoon.   This sort of stuff happens, right? My problem is that she was not stopped. She was screaming and her group was obnoxious. The people next to us got up and left they were so over it. We decided to leave as well. Not my scene. I prefer a place with a little class. This is not it.   I am sure the girl fell and sued the hell out of the place. She is probably now in the process of owning Hi Fi so no worries, it might close soon.   You cant buy class and this place proves that point.",

Inside was insane! It was a little too packed shoulder to shoulder, and a battle to even get to the bar! Moving around anywhere is a nightmare, and there was a bit to much hip hop. But other than that, it was great! Our drinks were great, the lightning and patio were awesome, and they shot of sparklers which was unique. It was a good choice for the bachelorette party! However we ended up at a bar across the street called blonde and had a even better time there! Such a nicely dressed crowed! Amazing music, and less crowded! Either way if you are in Scottsdale for sure go party at hifi with the sexy security, and awesome atmosphere.",

I suggest health inspectors come see this place ASAP. The ladies restroom was so gross. Toilet paper all over the place, a sink clogged and over flowing with rancid stagnant water and there was feces on the wall of a stall. I can't imagine what their kitchen looks like.   The food isn't bad but not amazing. The pretzels were impressive. Wish the service was as half decent as the pretzel.   Night life here is again interesting.... You wait in an line at the bar for about ten minuets when u finally reach the bar you're getting hit on by sweaty man who's wearing way too much cologne. The drinks are nothing special and the service all around is again less than stellar.   Not impressive.  Review update!!! I went back against my will but I must say that Molly the server is awesome. By far the best service I have EVER received at HiFi. Note to the owners and managers keep this girl around. She is on top of her game and actually seems to care about the company. She wasn't our server at first and was still super attentive!! (She ended up being our server in the end.)

Let's not forget to mention that the design of the open aired venue makes it more heated.

We had brunch for the first time here today and it was a \"experience\" to say the least. It started out great, with a friendly waitress and the manager doing table checks with all of the patrons. But where our Sunday brunch started to go downhill was when my boyfriends burger came out waaaayyy over cooked, and my eggs Benedict was missing it's side of potatoes. We had to wait just to track down our waitress just so we could send it back. That was annoying, then we had to wait an extra 15 minutes for a medium rare burger and my missing order of breakfast potatoes. During the wait my boyfriend orders an non alcoholic milkshake which didn't even make it to our table until we were paying. Then comes the issue with the bill. We intentionally ordered extra stuff beyond our groupon limit just to make sure we weren't just taking advantage of an online deal. So we had a tab of $10 after our groupon was applied. I have her $22 and asked for $5 meaning she could keep the rest as a tip. Well she NEVER came back to the table after dropping off the milkshake, trying to keep a $12 tip!! My boyfriend had to track her down and ask for change back. Then as we were walking out, the security harasses my boyfriend in attempts to say there was alcohol in his milkshake and that he couldn't leave with it. Needless to say, groupon or not, I'm never coming back to this establishment! So what if I'm walking distance? Plenty of other, more attentive and honest restaurants are within walking distance too! It started out ok, but when the order is wrong, takes forever to get fixed and them the waitress KEEPS your change, there's no hope of me returning.",

Unfortunately (like a few other Scottsdale locations) they either over charge (i.e. your credit card receipt says one thing and your card statement says another)  or charge your card multiple times.        It's Old Town Scottsdale so the 'scene' is typical of many of the bars in the area.  We met up with some friends who had already claimed an outside/patio table for 6, the 2 of us made 8 so we sat at the end of the table.  Service was doing what they could to get through the throngs of people, but we were left thirsty and wondering, more times than not, where was our server .  The saving grace was the company we were with and the DJ was playing some pretty fresh mixes.  [Yeah I am a sucker for a good DJ.]  The food looked good and the menu was unique.  If you are looking for a little fun and a typical days worth of calories, they have these adult shakes mixed with booze, ice cream, favorite kids breakfast cereal favorites and other stuff.  While I can not personally caloric-ally afford the whole shake it may be fun to try if treated as a shared desert between a few people at a table.",

    "text": "It all depends on what you like.  I went here twice.  Once on a Tuesday night and another time on a Friday night.  Cliff's notes:  If you like the \"club scene\", go on Friday.  If you're like me, you'll love Tuesdays here.  The first time I came here, it was a Friday night.  The line to get in was incredibly long.  The amount of alcohol-infused testosterone in this club causes numerous fights to break out and allow turnover to occur.  I was able to get in very quickly as a result.  It was hard to move around and it's a danger zone because some men can't handle competition and think it's manly to get into fights.  BOO!  I hated this place on Friday night.  Too much drama.  The music sucks too.  I don't know why people like listening to this top-40 crap all of the time, but it's ruining our society as a whole.  So is fighting over very small things.  People here have no ethics.  An acquaintance got pick-pocketed at Hi Fi.  Tuesday--I was reluctant to go to this place on Tuesday after all the immaturity and debauchery from Friday.  I had very low expectations for Hi Fi until I walked into the building.  It was a completely different place.  It had a wonderfully quiet ambience, friendly staff, and great happy hour deals!  I was so impressed with everything, but it was a shame I couldn't stay longer at this amazing place.  I'll never go to the club here again, but you'll likely find me here for Happy Hour.  FOUR STARS--it would've been FIVE if Old Town's disgusting weekend club/bar culture didn't exist.  And if it wasn't a NY Giants bar.",

About a month later I was informed that my phone was in fact there. They told me to come pick it up or it would be donated. Even then, it was like pulling teeth to get it because when I tried to pick it up, I was told again that they didn't have it. This was after they called me..

The richer areas like Bellevue, the same.. lines tend to move quick.  Scottsdale is comparable to Bellevue (Rich folks.. fancy cars.. etc.).   From what I saw the past few weekends (Saturday Nights), the only issue I have is the line.  Go there Saturday night.  Security personal checking your I.D. is that short white dude who thinks he's bad ass.  \"Hey girls.. I'll let you in.. but give me a hug.\" SMH.   One of the worst experiences.. There goes half the night.   This place could be awesome if it was bigger and better Security Personal who can check ID's faster.  Maybe Management told Security to check 1 ID every 5 to 10 minutes but that just means.. Management sucks even more.   People came to drink and have fun.. not wait in line for an hour just to get to the front of the line and wait another 15 minutes.  Sure I can give the short security guy some money.. but what's the point of free entry.  dafuq?   Hi Fi also needs to do a better job of managing the damn line.  People cut which may cause a fight to break out or some to jump over the fence onto the patio.    I give this place a 1 for wasting my time and wasting my time writing this damn review.    People, Try going to Whisky Row.. it's right next door.  Faster.. better looking girls and less crowded.  It's not a bumper to bumper grind on guys ass.

All the waitresses are in skimpy outfits and, even on a Monday at 4:30pm, everyone there was drunk.  I got the Mac and cheese, which, with every bite, would congeal into a weird gelatinous shape. It was like I was eating white velveeta that wasn't quite as good as velveeta. If I hadn't had a few Stella's before it, I might not have eaten it.  The place was empty, especially compared to the place across the street, which just further showed how this is not a place to get food. Go here late night if you choose but there's so many places in Scottsdale that it's hard to justify Hi Fi.",

I love the happy hour specials they have to offer and they have a really good selection and variety of food. If you're in the area this place is a MUST!",

It seems to be the launching pad for many of the bar crowd that occupy this place between 8-11pm. It is open late but it seems to slow late night as folks migrate to the other surrounding clubs. I will say that this place is a technological marvel. It is simply amazing what bars/clubs pull together to differentiate themselves these days.",

    "text": "Seriously?? -__-     ....... I'm sorry, but HELL NO! This place SUCKS!  I've only gone once, last Saturday night so you don't necessarily have to value my opinion, but whatever lol. My friend and I are semi new to AZ and were bouncing around Scottsdale, we asked the little golf cart driver guy for a fun place to check out and he recommended Hi Fi... weaaaahhhhhhhhh! WRONG!  We got there and this place was like a sardine can!! SUPER wayy too packed! There was NO room for dancing, or even just mingling. Frankly, you couldn't even breathe!! Brushing elbows? More like brushing noses! It was miserable and as soon as I felt my claustrophobia kicking in I needed to escape! We found a small patch of dry unsticky floor next to the VIP booths to stand on, it was elevated and probably 8 inches wide, but we stood there for a minute to catch our bearings and not get shoved around (we're only 5'1\" lol we almost drowned!) Oh and order a drink to relax? Faget about itt! It would have taken hours!  El Hefe was exactly the same! (which I'm about to review next), but who wants to \"party\" like that?? I want to be able to mingle, get a drink fairly quick, DANCE and I don't know have room to breathe and chill out. I know places may be popular and \"thee place to be\", but it would seem way more exclusive and maybe even worth paying entry if the atmosphere was right.  Like really Hi Fi they have \"maximum occupancy\" laws for a reason! I could not imagine what would happen if a fire broke out! This place is not only NOT fun, but also NOT safe!   I don't see myself ever going back on a Sat night, I don't know if it's different on other nights, but I digress, the ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because my friend and I didn't have to wait in their long ass line. We walked up to the front and they just let us in lol.",

I was not blown away, they were pretty good, just not very strong at all.  We ordered some hummus, some wings and a couple other appetizers.  The food was decent, once again nothing that blew me away.  I did really like the look of this place, cool for day drinking and nighttime drinking alike. Best view for people watching.  I would also say that I found it to be more of an early 20's crowd when I was there.",

    "text": "Came here the other night for a friend's 21st birthday. I've been here several times and it's a bit hit or miss for me. I think it largely depends on my mood.   PRO's: Awesome for people watching as there are usually a good combination of \"interesting\" people mixed with beautiful people. Prices aren't outrageous and I've never paid a cover charge here. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat. A good place to amuse young (21-23 year olds) friends/relatives.   CON's: A little on the douchey side at times. I don't know if it's more unique to Scottsdale than the bar itself but be prepared to be scrutinized openly by other patrons. Also, it's one of those bars where the music is loud but there's seemingly a lack of dance space. Most people congregate by the front to dance which is somewhat awkward. Also, be prepared to wait an eternity for a drink.   Overall, this bar is okay if you're literally looking for an \"Old Town\" experience such as a 21st birthday but not really one of my favs. I don't hate it but I don't love it either.",

We came at 9 p.m. and were lucky to get in without a line and find a table right away...but within the hour the waitstaff had made us move our table around and rearrange our chairs while we were waiting on our food and they hinted that if we stayed too much longer we'd need to vacate the table as they turn into \"bottle service\" after a certain point. Luckily the waiter was very nice about this, saying that if no one bought the table we could stay there as long as we liked.  We ordered some late night snacks - pretzels and beer cheese and wings. The food was delicious and I had no complaints about the drinks. The music selection was awesome - lots of 90s nostalgia in the early hours before it turns too clubby. This place is more my speed in the early hours, but quickly takes a turn for the douche after 10 p.m.",
