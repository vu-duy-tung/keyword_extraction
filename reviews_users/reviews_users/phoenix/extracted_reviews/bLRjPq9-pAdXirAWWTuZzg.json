    "text": "I struggle a bit with the stars and rating, and following is why.  Terminal 3 \"dining\" is abysmal.  (Terminal 4 = amazing).  Your choice is basically this place, Wendy's, Starbucks, or whatever you can dig out of your purse.  So if you need a pre-flight adult beverage, you're saddling up here.  (First star).  Our service was great - in sharp contrast to other reviews.  Quick, friendly, attentive.  (Second star.)  We didn't eat, so I can't speak to the food (Out of fairness, third star because I looked at the menu, and was enticed, despite the seeming airport high prices.)  Other thoughts/comments - the place was clean, and seemed overstaffed because many servers were hanging around chatting.  The bartender kept a clean bar, and promptly cleaned spots and arranged chairs to be inviting.  I had ONE Bloody Mary, and was offered a choice of Absolut, Kettle One, Tito's, Sky, etc., no house Vodka mentioned.  Choice was mild, medium or spicy - and I opted for medium, which was quite spicy.  Lemon, lime and celery (you always get bonus points from me if you serve it with celery).  Booooooooooo - served a double and wasn't told or asked, so blissfully and stupidly enjoyed a $14.00 drink.  Nope, not a typo.  Nope, not pleased.  Nope, not worth it.  Nope, not going back.  (Small fib - next time, I'll just order a beer.)  This place has an accidental and exclusive captive audience if you want a drink in Terminal 3.  Sadly, the $8 Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad from Wendy's, across the hall, sucked worse.",

This a place you eat at because you have time to kill before a flight, you are hungry, and you want something other than Wendy's. The beans suck, the rice is bland, and the tacos are overpriced. If you are in Phoenix on a layover, please don't judge the quality of Mexican food in the city from what they serve here.

Then I moved to the pickup area and the counter was stacked with boxes, so there was no room to put down a bag or your coffee, or pick up your food. Later as I was finishing the coffee, I got a mouthful of grounds in my mouth. I said something about the coffee to the same woman who was now unloading the boxes in the food pickup area and she wouldn't even acknowledge that I was speaking to her even though she was standing right next to me on the client side of the counter.

If not (or if you like beans, which somehow they were out of) you should probably avoid terminal 3 while anything remotely close to hungry, since somehow this is the only restaurant past security. I will say the beer tastes like beer, and the waitress looked like she felt sorry for us for eating at such a dump. Still, avoid it like the plague, since you might actually get it.",

After 15 minutes of sitting down, I decided to move to the bar and got much faster service. The margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as \"1800\" tequila. The restaurant actually smells kind of fishy and like dirty dishwater, but it seems overall pretty clean. As for the food, it's not absolutely horrible, but my enchiladas were sub-par for sure. Obviously, it's an airport place, but the chicken seemed like reheated grilled chicken strips and the tortillas were dry with a strange relish looking \"salsa verde.\" I wasn't appalled, but it's not the best option here. I only did it because the other choices were Wendy's and Starbucks.",

($4.99)  Verdict: if jalapeno was a 5, their spiciest salsa is a 7 and their green Chile would be a 3. Choose your salsa carefully.  The spiciness of their arbol is just enough for you to break a sweat and is a pretty good level for a relaxing side of chips and salsa.    I am Korean and LOVE spice so take this review with a grain if salt.  Decor is pretty lively and would consider the ambiance \"loud\" with music playing, customers chattering, and tvs barely audible during times of silence.   Full bar with tvs playing sports.  Not bad of a spot if you are looking for a place to kill time before your boarding time. Plenty of seating available and staff is very friendly and attentive.    I was not \"blown away\" hence the 4 but based on just good service, clean decor, lively atmosphere, and good chips and salsa, this spot is great.",

Once seated we were greeted promptly but after that pretty much on our own.    Ordered a Bloody Mary which was ok. Seemed more tomato juice than actual mix or alcohol.  Almost V8 like. At least I got my nutrients I guess ( high five ).   Then waited 20 minutes for another drink. After the waitress would not come around we just ordered from the bartender two margaritas.  These were even worse. Tasted of dirty sink water and expired margarita mix. Couldn't taste and tequila.  Pretty much forced it down out of principle since it was 10 freaking dollars.

Decor/cleanliness: 3 Nothing to really comment on here.  Nothing bad or anything really remarkable.  Food: 1 Wow!  Where I do I even begin?!  I ordered the shrimp, chicken, and steak fajitas and everything about this dish was lacking.  The steak was rubbery and tasteless.  But for a twist, the chicken and steak weren't tasteless at all... They were incredibly salty instead (what a great trade off!) ! The guacamole was just downright disgraceful.  It didn't even look like guacamole, just some watered-down, green paste!  The rice seemed to be of extremely low quality and was just as low in the taste department!  The tortillas were pretty awful as well.  This is definitely one of the worst fajitas meals that I have ever had the displeasure of trying to eat!  I spent a good portion of my plane ride hoping not to get sick!  Service: 2 So, let me get this straight... You serve subpar food and then have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for the privilege of trying to keep it down?!  The prices are ridiculous; even for airport food!  The one saving grace was that our waitress was nice and she checked up on us in a timely fashion.  Overall: 2  On the whole, we received decent service but, ultimately, the horrible food and high prices led to a very disappointing experience.",

Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste.   The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.

The food seemed fairly priced for an airport restaurant. I ordered the tacos and a 20 oz Pyramid beer. After quite a while, my food appeared. The pulled pork tacos lacked lettuce and tomatoes, as stated on the menu. The melted cheese threw me off as well. Then I got the bill.  The waitress ordered me quesadillas instead of tacos. This was after she repeated my correct order 2x and claimed she was so good at waitressing she didn't have to write anything down. The quesadillas were also much more expensive than the tacos I had ordered. I would have complained but the waitress was MIA for most of my meal. The 'tacos' were actually very tasty and the beer was good as well. I hope the other 2 random people I was sat with had correct meals because they also had lousy service.",

I very seldom do not find something I like about a place - but the only thing I could find I liked at this place was a Dos-Equis Amber draft.    I had a two hour wait until my plane was schedule to depart, and decided to have a beer and watch one of the baseball playoff games.  I really didn't expect much - I had already eaten, and simply wanted to kill time for a couple of hours.   Service - No stars!! The bartender was surly, not just to me but to all of his customers.  I never saw him smile, talk, or express any emotion other than slapping drinks in front of his customers, and acting like he was angry at the world.  Food - No stars!! The people next to me ordered nachos, chips, and some kind of chicken dish.  They were served with plastic cups of hot sauce, guacamole, and in plastic baskets. The food appearance was unappetizing, and ridiculous for the price.  How do I know they were bad? The people left the food uneaten after several tastes, and went next door to another eatery.   Beer - One star!!  You can't ruin Dos Equis, so I will give them one star. If I could take that one away, I would - just for the surliness of the bartender.  So if you are going to stop here before your plane takes off - do not sit at the bar, and do not order food. You may be lucky and get a friendly waitress - but there were none in sight when I was there.",

The food is awful! And their \"choice or option\" is not really that. You can either get 3 tacos, A quesadilla, or A burrito. No mixing or matching allowed. And if you only wanted say 1 taco, forget it not allowed. You HAVE to order the the full 3 taco option ranging from $12-17.  Terminal 3 traveler find somewhere else!! Trust me!",

There were a few patrons here and there, so I can't speak about crowds, but I was craving breakfast and got the Huevos with bacon and potatoes, and it was served with a couple of flour tortillas on the side instead of bread. Huevos is spanish for eggs just so you all know.   The meal was adequate. It wasn't horrible. But it wasn't too good either. The best part of the meal was the eggs, which were fluffy and buttery. They were delicious. Everything else was horrible. The bacon barely tasted like bacon. It was more like crispy salt sticks. The potatoes, which are hard to screw up, in fact were tasteless as well as soggy and mushy, and the tortilla, well it was hard, dry, and stale. In fact, that four tortilla was the most disgusting tortilla I had ever eaten in the 10 years I lived in AZ, and I had been around college kids who had no inkling on how to cook who knew how to properly heat up a tortilla.  However I must say that the customer service was great, and the food arrived in a timely fashion. So if you are craving breakfast and want fast service and good customer service, but do not care about the quality of the breakfast food, then look no further than this place. I will not be coming here again myself, at least for breakfast.",

There were five of us and only actable for four so I asked grabbed a chair at the bar, which was right next to our table, and the bartender named Art told me to put the chair back and that I could not move the chair. I thought he was joking at first but he as serious. So my niece asked what our options are and he was rude. Seriously?! The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one was because our server Jennifer was not bad. There was absolutely no need to Art to be rude and if he didn't want us to move a chair, he should have offered an alternative instead of just starring at us. Not being able to move a chair in a restaurant is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard! Stay away from this place. Especially from Art.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review as a formal complaint because I could not find a Web site to do so.   First off, my waiter was visibly annoyed when I did not immediately order food. He even came back and took my menu away even though I had said I was going to order food later. I had gotten a drink,  so I was still a customer and the pave was hardly packed.  When my drink was finished,  he totally ignored me and his colleague had to check in with me.  Then he gave her the wrong drink order.   I then started looking at the menu. When I closed it, even though he saw me,  he did not come to take my order.  As I prepared to flag him down,  same colleague had to come and save his butt. I ordered my burrito to go because I was so over it and I needed to charge my phone.   Food comes out on a plate.  When I say something to my waiter he doesn't even respond to me just goes straight to the woman covering his table and goes \"did she really order that to go?\"  Yes,  I could hear him.  Rude.  So I pay,  finish my beer,  and go to put the burrito in the box. No tin foil, no apology for not getting it right.   The table was super narrow and he put the box on the very edge.  Now in a hurry, I don't even look before putting the burrito in the box and it immediately falls to the floor.  When I asked what they could do,  the answer was essentially to eat it off the floor.  How about a refund for my delicious floor burrito? Or at least an apology?",

On the Beans... server had to help me find them - I thought they had been forgotten- customer next to me said she should have warned me - she did the same thing!

Maybe we were lucky or they read the reviews and improved greatly, but I have not much to complain about.  I had a tortilla soup and churros, the soup was absolutely delicious, very flavorful, and topped with a generous scoop of Guacamole. The  churros had a tad too much cinnamon sugar for my taste, but they were crispy and fresh.  My fiance really enjoyed his barbacoa pepito.  The service was very friendly and attentive, the food came quick and despite it being busy we weren't rushed to finish. The only small complain I have is that the tables for two are very small, our three plates and two drinks covered it completely and we had to play some tetris to be able to eat.  The prices are airport prices.... more than you'd pay elsewhere but not overly expensive.  Overall I'd definitely recommend eating at this place.",

Tiny spot of beans were cold and obviously canned. Rice was cold and flavorless, like Uncle Ben's. Tacos were in thin and hardening flour tortillas with a sliver of fried fish, some slaw and absolutely drenched in the most dreadful mayonnaise based sauce (mostly like thousand island burger sauce). Disgusting. No time to complain (my flight was  boarding), but I actually felt sorry for the server that this is his job.

They have a whole bar area and bar top area along the perimeter and not a single plug to plug any device in.  I take that back.  I saw one plug.  I would not be surprised by thing five years ago, however it todays time you need to have power in an airport.  People can't travel without it and most places are at the minimum retrofitting power strips into the high bar tops areas.  Get with today and install some power so people can be productive during their multiple hour flight delays.  That is all I have to say.  Get plugs.",

    "text": "Terminal 3 is undergoing some growing pains. As a result, there's very very few eating options after 9PM. There's few before that, too. We had a late-night flight, and having missed dinner, bellied up to a table at Taberna del Tequileria. I'd had tacos from their express station before, and wasn't scared of the low ratings.   The biggest issue with this restaurant is its service. There's no hostess to seat you. You'll either awkwardly stand there, waiting for a greeting (and never get one), or roll the dice on seating yourself and never getting served. We lucked out, choosing a well-visible table, and our server came over within 5 minutes-- not ideal, but not bad. Another table near us, which had obviously been there for some time before we sat down, wasn't greeted by their server until *our* server notified the other that she had a table, some 5 minutes after we'd already had our order taken.  Menu is very, very limited-- a big disappointment to my husband, who doesn't particularly crave Mexican food. Think tacos, burritos, quesadillas. I ordered 3 carnitas (pork) tacos \"Mexican style\" (cotija cheese, pico de gallo and pickled onions). My husband went with a burrito. There was no \"plain\" bean and cheese burrito on the menu, but he asked the waitress-- who seemed a bit confused-- nevertheless, he ended up getting what he asked for. Prices are up there, for Mexican food. A combo plate (with limited offerings and unclear side dishes) will cost you $15. They don't list prices for drinks, a sure sign of dollar-bill hemorrhaging. Chips and salsa aren't gratis at the beginning of the meal, standard for any \"good\" Mexican restaurant.  The tacos were \"ok\": carnitas were good, so were the toppings, but the corn tortillas were soggy and falling apart. Rice and beans (apparently) were included as a side, but were terrible-- especially the rice, which was basically parboiled Minute rice. Jamie's bean burrito came with chips and salsa on the side (also not on the menu), and he was quite pleased with his simple meal. Waters were had because, although I wanted a margarita, the prospect of spending $15 on a bottled sweet-n-sour crappy marg turned me off.    It was a \"bite to eat\", not an experience, and if there was any competition in Terminal 3, Taberna would either have to revamp it's approach, or suffer the consequences. For now, they're safe in the lack of competition.",

My server, Consuelo, provided that magical combination of surly attitude and horribly slow service. The woman who was seated after me, was DONE eating before my nachos were served to me...cold...by another server as my server waited for drinks at the bar while my food sat in the window. This was only after I flagged down the other server, of course. Consuelo did not check on me one single time after my food was delivered. I used to be a waitress so I am a generous tipper and almost never leave anything below 20%. Consuelo, however, was lucky to get a dollar & some change on my $25 tab...and that was generous.  Si, I did pay $13 for the worst nachos of my life. The chicken was cold, rubbery and inedible. I munched on a handful of chips with cold cheese sauce and queso fresca before giving up entirely.  I hope that this restaurant closes down so Terminal 3 can be blessed with a new, friendly, tasty dining option. In the meantime...EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE!",

Service was incredibly slow, our waitress seemed highly overwhelmed and it was difficult to order or get our check.  We ordered 2 cocktails, guacamole, chicken tacos, and a caesar salad. Our disappointing meal came out to about $70....seriously. The drinks were overly sugary and I have a sneaking suspicion they were missing the alcohol. The guac was ok, but served piled on a tray of chips and topped with an overwhelming amount of sweet pickled onions. The chicken on both the salad and the tacos was exactly the same, some sort of rubbery meat that tasted fake and seemed like it had been pre-cooked and then microwaved. The tacos were served on undercooked tortillas and topped with about half a cup of sour cream. The salad was made up of sad wilted romaine and came with a very underwhelming dressing.   Avoid this place, it is not worth it.",

She never came back and then never came back and then I didn't get to eat anything. This is a hard one not to recommend because the only alternative is a closing magazine stand.  Sunni!

If you are sick of burgers/fries and you don't really feel like a day-old saran wrap sandwich then this is pretty much your only hope.   But it sucks so much here. The service is so slow. So slow. So so so slow. Man, I don't get it. This is an airport, folks. Every single customer here has a flight to catch. Can you hustle a bit?   I ordered the chimichanga. It sucked. Tasted like a really awful egg roll. The rice tasted like invisible flavor nothingness. Beans were slosh. Service was sh*t. I was so irritated after waiting 88 hours just to flag down my server.   Should have stopped at the newspaper stand for that saran wrap sandwich instead. ugh.",

The staff were very nice and I got a double order of my usual vodka pineapple. I also ordered the Las Wing, which were spicy. My sinuses opened up immediately as soon as my food came. My server took forever to pick up my signed receipt so I left it at the bar and went to the bathroom and then went to my gate. She chased me down and said she didn't have a signed copy. I told her I left it at the bar and she had me sign again. It was unusual but unfortunately this was the only place at my gate that served alcohol.  Ehhh, MAYBE I'd come back but hopefully there's Bette options and service next time.",

I ordered the shredded chicken tacos and asked for salsa verde. The tacos were lukewarm and bland and arrived with the standard red salsa in a little plastic cup with a lid on it, along with a set of plastic flatware, some black beans, and rice. The beans tasted like plain black beans out of a can. The rice was plain white rice. They desperately needed some flavor, so I tried the red salsa; all heat and no flavor, not good. I waited for the server to return and check on me so that I could get the green salsa I ordered.  And waited. And waited. And waited. She walked by twice to deal with other tables and I tried to catch her eye; no luck. I put down the utensils and sat there and stared at her: nothing. Waved. \"Excuse me...\" Nothing.   Finally I gave up and marched up to the bar, where she was standing there chatting with the bartender, and asked if I could please get the salsa verde.   A few minutes later she drops by my table and sets a little plastic cup of salsa verde on my plate. It's half full. There's no lid. Salsa is dripping over the edge. There are bits of green onion and queso blanco stuck to the sides. It's fairly obvious that she plucked it off the plate of some other diner who had finished their meal.  Terrible food and worse service.",

Servers survive on tips. Ideally, the bigger the meal, the higher the tip. By telling me the truth about the key lime pie she risked a lesser tip for honest service. LOVE that! If you go here..

    "text": "Food and service are mediocre, eavesdropping at the bar is great.  Sitting at the bar and my drink order was fast. However, he took forever to check back with despite my asking for a menu and if the kitchen is still open.  I ordered chicken tortilla soup. It was served quickly and was Luke-warm. I thought the brought me the wrong thing because it was a brown gravy with tiny bits of chicken (think Cambell's condensed) beams, and huge green onion chunks covered in a gigantic dollup of sour cream. Thankfully it is served with tri-colored chips. I use this to scoop up he gravy.  This is nothing like a real taqueria and tastes overly processed, not fresh and bland. So disappointed. With 10 items on a menu one should think they can do them well.  Atmosphere-plenty of space, multiple tvs. The tvs are small though.  Overall not a great experience but nothing else is opened and I'm taking an overnight flight.  Sigh. Ill ask for my bill now so I don't run out of time since service is slow and I still haven't been asked-How's the soup?",

Seats started to open up, and we were starving- I would have eaten scraps on the floor.  We got served fairly quickly, and were able to grabs a few pre-flight brews.  The food came out hot as well.  It didn't taste spectacular, but it was hot and filled us up.  I cannot complain there!  They close around Midnight, so keep that in mind if you have a red-eye flight.  The prices aren't too terrible either (no entree over $10 except special fajitas), and the waitress was pretty accomodating.  I could see this place easily getting slammed!",

We ordered nachos and taco salad (because really....how can you mess that up?) The chicken wasn't real chicken. A majority of the chips were stale. The melted cheese was cold. The salad dressing was warm. I would have asked for the nachos to be re-heated, but we didn't see our waitress again for about 20 minutes. {However when we did see our waitress, she was nice.  They were busy and understaffed.} By the time all was done, I had paid almost $20 for the nachos and a bottle of water, and was literally sad as I signed the receipt knowing it was such a waste of money. Don't waste your time, money, or daily calories.",

As I waited 15 minutes for my to-go order - it would've been longer if I hadn't asked and they realized my ticket got lost - a fellow customer said they had been on the restaurant side and had to cancel their order after waiting 30 minutes and being told it would not be done anytime soon. Why they couldn't just package up their order instead of making them wait again on the Express side is beyond me. 15 and 30 minutes may not seem like much, but in an airport restaurant that is WAY too long.",
