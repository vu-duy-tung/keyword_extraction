But we got a rectification of our experience with the avocado/plantain starter. This is a weird delicious, tasty mix for an appetizer. They mix it with a mango sauce that despite your mind says no, your mouth says yes.   After this, and trying another creation my friend order, it is worth to consider to come back and try it with a clean mind.",

    "text": "The gap between perception and reality here is amazing. Great website and beautiful build out of the restaraunt. The first clue that something was off was that they made us wait to be seated in an almost empty restaraunt. It was clear that it was policy that you had to wait no matter what.  Our waiter had the telltale signs of a current or previous meth addiction. He was extremely pushy on upselling. He knocked my very expensive sunglasses to the floor and scratched them and thought an appropriate comment was \"at least they are only plastic\". The food was simply not good. Mashed potato was not even mashed, pork was way over cooked. My mojito had endless pieces of mint in it. Every sip I had to spit out mint! The mint was also VERY old. I make a lot of mojitos and you have to leave the mint in the fridge for over a month to look like that. They claim no microwaves on their website but my mash was only partially warm and clearly not made that day.  I've since read reviews of the place and they apparently look down on chain restaraunts. Sadly the food and drink does not rise to the level of a well run chain. I'm no fan of chains but I've had a lot better meals in strip mall chains than this place. If you like good food stay away. If \"fake it until you make it\" works for you this place would be number one.",

We had made reservations prior to dining and I would recommend that to everyone; it is not that big of a restaurant and fills up quickly.  We started out with Plantain/Avocado baked Spring Rolls and some Jerk Prawns.  Both dishes were fantastic.  The jerk seasoning had an appropriate level of spiciness and the baked plantain rolls were creamy and sweet with the mango chutney that comes with it.  For dinner we had the pimiento-smoked mussels and the jerk chicken.  Both dishes were awesome.  You could taste the smoky flavor in the broth of the mussels and the jerk chicken was fantatstic.   For drinks, we both started out with their dark n stormy rum/ginger beer concoction. Expensive, but worth it.  Also had a couple Red Stripes, which, at $4 each is a bargain.  The waiter was a little pushy with the suggestions and specials, but, he is partly a salesman, and was doing his job.  I will go back to the Breadfruit, as I am a huge fan of rum, and they have a whole other side of the restaurant dedicated to that fine sugar cane juice.",

For those of you for whom patois is not your first language, please note the following... you will feel like you are very much in an authentic Jamaican environment minus the accent.  This place is cute and trendy.  I have one complaint really and that has to do with the value of the meal.  I ordered jerk chicken and literally ate a piece of chicken breast and paid about $40 when I add the sweet potato pudding and sorrell...no alcohol. Yes. That means I was sober when I paid for that bit of protein.   So, if you really want some good Jamaican knosh...make friends with some real Jamaicans, mon! I also have to say that if you turn up early...even five minutes early...they will make you sweat it out in the hot Arizona sun. I am not sure why they dont let you wait inside, but... again...now you know. Be careful to find a place that is safe to park at.  I parked behind the establishment after making sure that the space was kosher because there is a movement in the area to ticket as many people as it takes to buy a meal at Breadfruit!",

    "text": "Incredible, is how I'd describe our dining experience on 8/21.  Our waiter was top notch and asked if we'd been there before (we hadn't) and how we heard about it (Check Please, Arizona).  With that information, he walked us through the rum menu, stating that the left side are custom drinks you'll only get at this restaurant and they're purposely in 3 groups with the top section paired with the appetizer, the middle with dinner, and the bottom with dessert.  We decided to try it this way.  We're very glad we did. My wife had that day's punch bowl, I had The Shorty which we paired with the Scallops.  I enjoyed my whole meal, but let's just say I will come back for the scallops alone. Next we had the Sugarfoot and the Sometime in August with dinner.  My wife's Sugarfoot was her favorite drink of the night.  My drink had a smokey quality to it which made it very unique.  My wife had the curried Dungeness crab salad and I had the jerk pork and polenta.  The pork was succulent and flavorful with just a mild kick.  (Note: I like spicy food so some may find the kick more substantial than mild, but it was just enough for a pleasant warmth for me.  I suspect the reviewer who found the scallops oppressively hot would disagree with me). For dessert, my wife had Mutiny in the County, and I had Tradewind Swizzle for our drinks.  Both were quite good and definitely sweet dessert drinks.  Hers was very unique due to the Irish Moss ingredient.  We shared the chocolate creme brule.  This was done because I'm not normally a big dessert eater and one or two bites of that will suffice and my wife can eat the rest.  Well.... this creme brule is smaller and better than most.  I could have eaten my own.  My wife too also enjoy her entire meal.  But she said she'd come back for the dessert alone.  :) Overall, we had an enjoyable dining experience from beginning to end.  We'll definitely be back.  Last note: Make a reservation - this is a small restaurant and you will very likely have a bit of a wait if you just drop in.",

    "text": "James Beard would have cut the corn.    --Okay so I know you must be wondering exactly what that means.  We went to the restaurant on a wed night--picked up a great rose from AZ Stronghold at public market to avoid the corkage fee and was looking forward to a new dining experience.    Things started out fabously--the wait person was well informed and helpful with the menu.  We decided to split three dishes.  We ordered the scallops appetizer--they were perfect!  done to perfection which is not easily done with scallops.  We split them --put one on each plate.  Next came the jerk chicken salad--again--a wonderful complement of spicy chicken and mangos--the perfect marriage of spice and sweet.  we commented we had made the perfect choice of the Rose from AZ Stronghold and looking forward to the next course.  and so it came--jerk prawns, grilled pineapple on slaw--with a half an ear of corn--ahhhhhh there's the rub.  the plate would looked lovely, but because we were sharing--I asked the wait person--if the corn could be cut in half--don't get me wrong, i really liked my dining companion, but could not just bring myself to  nibble on the same ear of corn.  the wait person took the plate  back to the kitchen--we were salivating because the prawns smelled really wonderful--  then the plate came back--and the ear of corn was still in tack-- during the course of rest of the evening we were given several reasons, why this simple request could not be accomodated  ahh-the chef is an artist and cutting the corn would have upset the balance of the design of the plate.  we could not cut the ear ourselves because there were no sharp knives.-- there are only two chefs and there isn\"t time to accomodate special requests  ok--this is a restaurant with maybe 10 tables--by the time we left there were only 2 people left in the restaurant.--so special requests can't be accomodated?  Also we would have eaten the corn, but instead it was wasted.  I am self employed and my customers are everything to my livlihood.  If I can accomodate I will even though it might not be exactly what I want to do--because the more important thing is I want to establish long term relationships with  them and have them come back again and again and again.  Unfortunately--I will not be going back to breadfruit--the food was generally good--but I would rather spend my dining dollar in someplace the recognizes that it is so easy to accomodate simple requests and the benefit to do that is repeat customers.--it would have been so easy to have satisfied customers, by simply cutting the ear of corn.",

Went to RumBar recently, but hadn't had a chance to check out the Breadfruit and its updated menu until tonight.  The original place is still largely in tact, but has a distinctly refined look to it now.  It used to be just a hole in the wall type of place, but it now feels like a really well rehearsed performance.  The food has largely stayed the same with alot of the usual jerk and caribbean favorites.  On this night I went for the pimento wood smoked mussels.  Good stuff (though I wish I could've had more).  The beans and rice were solid.  The bread was delicious just as I remember.  And the drinks from the RumBar were on point.  We topped off the evening with a chocolate creme brulee.  My girlfriend was a happy camper with that one.  Overall the Breadfruit has definitely matured from its early beginnings.  It still has the feel of a neighborhood haunt, but feels more like a sit down restaurant than a humble startup.  The prices are a little on the high side with some of the dishes and some of the cocktails are a little steep.  But overall I'm very impressed with how Breadfruit has evolved.",

    "text": "Editing my previous review because I decided to give the Rum Bar another chance. I'm glad that I did. It was a totally different experience during my subsequent visits! I tried the Pina Colada which is out of this world good! The service during our subsequent visits was infinitely better. Infinitely. I'm surprised we decided to give this place another shot after our initial experience, but I'm glad we did. It must have been an off night because our following visits have been consistently good.   Old review below:  I really wanted to love this place.   My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from the east coast. He's a native of the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and I lived there for many years. We know good rum. When we saw the aptly named \"Rum Bar\" was only blocks from our home in the arts district, we were super happy. We decided to give it a go on a night of celebration.   From the moment we walked in, there was confusion. They were about 45 minutes away from closing, which we assumed was ample time for a drink and an appetizer. I noticed that they had two of our favorite Venezuelan rums. When I explained to the bartender what kind of rum we typically like and asked if she could recommend something similar so we can broaden our horizons a bit, she looked a bit wide-eyed and proceeded to ask a man who was sitting on the corner of the bar who I am going to assume is the owner. That became the precedent for the evening. We asked a question, she asked the man at the bar. Perhaps it was her first night, and that's OK, but a few smiles would have turned this review into a positive one. In addition to her overall unfriendly demeanor, we simply couldn't get over how pretentious the place felt. My husband ordered a Cuba Libre. The bartender hesitated much longer than was necessary and told him \"we serve that rum in a snifter\" effectively telling him he couldn't order what he wanted. She then brought him a flight of rum which wasn't even the same brand as the drink he had ordered. When we both looked confused, she took it away and started to pour another flight. By now, we were really irritated and felt really unwelcome. My husband corrected her again. \"Please, I'd like a Cuba libre.\" Rum is fun, people. Maybe not wherever the owner is from, but in Venezuela, it's passed around at the beach. We drink it at every party, formal or otherwise. Cuba libre is a perfectly legitimate cocktail, just as legitimate as the mojito I ordered (which I will say, was excellent, hence the two stars instead of one) When it was clear we weren't going to accept the flight of rum she was trying to force on us, she walked over the the man at the bar yet again, who laughed (at our pedestrian choice of drink?) and waved his hand in resignation. She then brought my husband the tiniest, most watered down rum and coke imaginable. Not a Cuba libre. A rum and coke. No lime to speak of. When he asked for a lime to turn his rum and coke into some semblance of a Cuba libre, she said \"oh you wanted lime with that?!\" incredulously.   We ordered the plantain spring rolls with mango chutney. They were utterly tasteless, except for the chutney. It was basically store bought frozen won ton wrapper and not a hint of sweet plantain. Not one hint.   We're exceptionally disappointed that we didn't love this place. The only redeeming factors (not for us, we won't be back) are the prices which are reasonable and their good selection of rums.",

The chef chooses 2-3 plates to serve daily-it's kind of a surprise.   Food:  We ordered the Jerk Pork Sliders and Pork Belly w/ plantain.  We were highly satisfied with the pork sliders. They had a good flavor and just enough heat.  However, the Pork Belly w/ plantain was not to our liking. The dish is unique in terms of composition and presentation, but it's super small, (check out the photo) and the pork belly consisted of no meat, just pure pork belly fat. It was disappointing.    To drink, we ordered the Rum punch bowl special for the day.  It was amazing-full of ginger, lemon, honey, rum..etc.  I generally like drinks on the sweeter side, but this was a great balance.   Ambiance: It's casual upscale- a good setting for friends or casual business. There is nice Caribbean music playing in the background.  It's definitely my style.  Service: We sat at the bar.  There was a new bartender in training, which slowed things down a bit, but other than that, it was great.   If you don't want to eat, that's fine, but definitely go for a drink-try the punch bowl special of the day.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Jamaican food having a really good friend from the island that spoils me with authentic recipes that have passed down through generation in his family and traveling all over the world my palette is internationally known lol!   Back to the story, needless to say my taste buds were going crazy with expectation! Well dannng, my girlfriend and I stood at the podium long enough to pull up Yelp and read several mixed reviews, since we had been noticed yet NO ONE was coming over to greet us we started toward the empty bar with one guy seated and a totally empty lounge area when we noticed the sign, \"Please wait for server to be seared including the bar\". So we waited and waited and waited until someone- anyone would make eye contact with us, finally a waitress approached us and asked if we have a reservation, I snickered like really, my girlfriend said no we do not and she stated it would be a wait haha okaaaay so we waited only shortly though.   Once at the table we began browsing the drink menu in search of the Jamaican rum Wray&Nephew which they did so cool now as for the menu, we both noticed the absence of jerk wings hmm we thought maybe we'll ask our server. The server approached our table with a mouthful of the day's special selection and a great grasp of the menu, very impressive so we ordered Admiral's Punch and some starters: She had the Roasted Plantains with Chutney dip and I had the Baked Mango Fish Rolls. The plantains were soft not crisp and void of flavor as for my fish rolls they were pretty good but the fish was over cooked. The drinks were a bit weak until we added shots of Wray&Nephew.   So as we sat sipping, a man stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our food, we looked at each other and she asked why jerk wings weren't served on the starter menu. The islander became very defensive explaining \"his island eats the whole bird not just part of it\", my girlfriend rebutted, having spent a lot of time in Jamaica feasting on local island cuisine as well as falling in love with the jerk wings! Wellll this stuck a nerve and to be quite honest I don't think he was expecting a real reply to his question just pretending to care.   Needless to say, in life you meet some people that try so hard to upscale their image that they lose the True essence of their identity! Oh and he was rude because he kept wanting to rush off as if the place was packed lol!   WARNING:  the only people that would be impressed by the food are those that have never truly experienced \"real\"Jamaican cuisine. And to think their \"philosophy: Our philosophy is that good food should be good to eat...\", my point exactly! In case you're wondering the one star was for having actual Jamaican rum!",

    "text": "So I wound up at the breadfruit with the Yelp Az International Supper Club (my 1st time, and glad I went, look forward to many other eating adventures to come!) on a Thursday night, 1st off how come no one has written about the parking? I'm from Chandler and don't go downtown that often, and didn't bring change with me for the parking meters so wound up in a parking lot not too far from the restaurant and paid 5 bucks for less than 2 hours.  Oh well, I'm putting it out their now, bring change to feed the meters.  I have mixed feelings on the Breadfruit and I'll explain, the food, which was good, I enjoyed it and did eat it, I think is little overpriced, for example the pineapple upsidedown cake I order, that was maybe 4 bites was 9.50, that was more than my pina colada, come on now, maybe they want you to drink to forget the prices lol. Also people were saying the size of the entree dishes were small, but for me it was perfect, I think it's because we are so used to our plates being full of food that we forget what the right portion of food is. But because of the price, I am rating it 3 stars for now.  There were mussels for everyone to enjoy, and if you are seafood person I bet they would have been for you! I did try one, the broth was delish! The flavors omg so good, the only thing that ruined it for me was the mussel, but that's because I don't care for seafood, so don't listen this part of my review haha.  My friend and I ordered the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls, which were avocado, ripe plantains baked in a wanton wrap paired with house mango chutney. Ok if you never had an avocado cooked, then it would throw your taste buds for loop, but for me this little appetizer was good, and the mango chutney was a perfect paring! Didn't disappoint!  I ordered the Jerk Chicken off the grill, I have been craving jerk chicken forever, and this came with a slaw of sorts, mango chutney, grilled pineapple and a corn on the cobb that tasted like it was glazed in coconut, omg so good, I wish all corn on the cobb was like that! The jerk chicken had great flavor and kick! My taste buds were jumping! I cut up a little piece and paired it with a piece of grilled pineapple & mango chutney and it was party time! Like eyes rolling back good! Man that was great!  The little bread stick was a nice treat too, little bit on the sweet side, enjoyed it.  That was a perfect dish! I would come back for that!  Ok so I wound up ordering desert, which is something I rarely do, but I was sold on the description of pineapple upside cake, I love that stuff!!! Well I had high hopes for this cake, it was a very small portion and it came with a steep price of 9.50. If it was everything that had been described to me, I think I would have been ok with the price, but the cake was dry, not as moist as I like it, it had few pineapples on it, and the glazed was only on the corner of the cake, but that glazed was good.  I just wanted it to be more than what it was! I think next time I will skip the desert and order another drink haha.  Glad to have found the Breadfruit and I bet I will be coming back for that Jerk Chicken soon!",

    "text": "What an awesome and quaint spot. If I lived in AZ this would be my regular place to dine, drink and light up a stogie.  One thing to note: they open at 5pm on the dot. We had rsvp for 5p and I could literally hear them check the time and not let us in until it was 5p exactly. That  was off-putting but understandable. Off-putting because we were the only people there (10 min early) and would have loved to sit at the bar for a while, but understandable because they wanted to be ready for any crowd at anytime and we knew it opened at 5. But anyway - the food was a excellent. A nice modern take on traditional Jamaican fare. Everything needed a dash more salt to bring out the flavors more. We ordered the ham hock and butter beans (beans a bit more al dente than we like) but the hock was smoked and cooked nicely. The escovitch catch of the day was great (requested more escovitch). The jerk Cornish hens were pretty good too just the right smoke and spice. Now onto the drinks - rum punch of the Day was a bit to medicine-y for us. But, can I tell you- the rum old-fashion, the pina colada, and the velvet and vinyl are exquisite! For dessert we opted for the rum cake - which was rich and dense like a rum pudding. Nice consistency and flavor. But by far the BEST part of the meal was the appetizer - Seared Sea Scallops!!! We had several orders. I guess I would be remiss if I didn't mention the atmosphere - looks upscale but it's a very comfortable space. The cigar area was cozy and the Mural on the was was fantastic! I wish I would have take a picture. Anyway. I hope this was helpful. Do it!!!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place for a while and am so glad that I did. First off I am no stranger to The Caribbean, Jamaica or Rum. This is extremely creative food in a very hip funky space. The staff has it going on. Very organized, almost orchestrated to make your dining experience flow as smoothly as the sweet reggae music in the background. We had 3 small plates and then split an entree. The plantains with a mango dipping sauce were terrific as were the scallops. The heat of the Scotch bonnet peppers was evident and went very well with the most excellent cocktails that they serve. We had Hemingway's Daiquiri and the punch bowl special. Truly magical! next came the jerk shrimp small plate and the Jerk Pork entree. Amazing shrimp that had a sweet hot fruity sauce around the bowl to go with the Johnny cakes and a home made tarter sauce for the shrimp. Very good. The Jerk Pork over polenta was a very creative dish. Not a large portion but we found it to be just right. Decided to have 1 more cocktail before leaving for the Symphony. Asked the waiter to bring me a sipping rum over ice. He asked me a few flavor questions and a price range ( the range is from 8 to 2500, yes two thousand five hundred, dollars per glass. The rum collection is vast and comes from all over the world!!) the glass of rum arrived with a single large cube of ice and was the best rum I have ever tasted. M had the Velvet and vinyl which she loved. We decided right then to return after the Symphony for desert!! We did and sitting at the amazing bar she had a desert cocktail, a sea salt and caramel rum desert drink that was wild and rum cake while I sipped another daiquiri. I can't recommend this place strongly enough. The bartenders will educate you about rum and you get to watch them make some great cocktails as well. Do go here and try it all!!",

I had initially made reservations for 2 at 8:15, but then when another couple wanted to join us, open table would no longer let me edit our reservation so I called to change the number dining; However, no one there answered the phone at 5:45 pm and their voicemail says \"Do not leave a voicemail\" umm okay. Anyway so we get there at 8:00pm and they are able to modify our reservation for us even though they were \"completely packed\" per the host, they could seat us at 8:15. The table the sat us at was actually empty the 15 minutes we were waiting so not sure why we couldn't be sat right away.   Table ordered drinks, the rum punch is extremely delicious and is made fresh and different every day. Table also tried multiple other drinks and all were great, if you are willing to wait 20-30 min per cocktail. We even tried ordering our next drink while our original was nearly full hoping to make up for the extremely long cocktail wait, but we still would wait forever with empty drinks in front of us.  Appetizers that were ordered came out quick and were tasty. However, Our actual meal took nearly an hour and half. So if you are in any sort of rush I do not recommend this place. Our server was nice and tried, and I do not feel our incredibly long waits were anything in his control, but the kitchen and bar need to get their act together.   The host there is also incredibly rude, as stated he was able to modify the reservation, but made it a big deal first and acted like we were causing a huge inconvenience to his night. My husband went in to use the restroom and was accused of not actually being a customer there, even though this is the same guy that sat us and we had been on the patio waiting forever. Not really a great way to treat your customers who are pretty irritated to begin with.",

I hear they grow back...  We wait in the booth inside during this warm night for our friend to arrive around 10pm or so.  Once she arrives, Luke (I think) our server takes us to our table and continues the amazingness.  My adventurous husband invites Luke to bring suggestions including a unique smoked pineapple rum concoction.  As it was our friends birthday he brings a huge rum sniffer and a shot if some fabulous rum.  He really made our experience at this local gem memorable.",

Stocked by Churchill's cigars; a local cigar shop, Rum Bar has a reasonable selection of about eight or ten cigars and a bar full of rum and a mixologist to go with it. If you're into rum drinks this is also one of the best spots in town to get one.  There are definitely a handful of shops in the area you can pick up a cigar, but none of them are open past 8 or 9 pm, and none of them will serve you a cocktail while you smoke. When I'm out with the pals and in the mood for a cigar, it's generally not before 8 pm. You've got to have a bit of forethought for that, and I'm rarely blamed for foreword thinking, that's for sure. Sure the drinks are premium priced, and the cigars too, but this is the spot when you're looking to pair them up.  Note that smoking is only on their outdoor patio, and not in an inside lounge. It would be nice to find a spot with an inside smoking lounge in the downtown area, but beggars can't be choosers, right? :-/  Happy Yelping Phoenix, see you around downtown!",

Needless to say we had suitcases with us, and they were more than accommodating. They sat us at a table that had a little extra room by it so we had space to put our bags...they didn't make us feel like a burden, which we really appreciated. Having said that, the servers definitely get a perfect ten for hospitality. Our waiter even showed us some dishes he carried out for other tables to show us what it was. Such a nice touch!   Now for the best part, THE FOOD. Let me tell you that I have had very authentic Caribbean food on quite a few islands and this was wonderfully prepared. Thoughtful dishes with a perfect blend of spices and sauce. The desert was fantastic too.   No matter what you order on the menu you must order a cocktail (if you don't drink they have some beautiful looking non-alcoholic drinks as well). They really know how to make a unique drink! The only downside was that the happy hour didn't apply at the tables, just the bar. I know a ton of restaurants do this and it's not like they're the only one, but still a bummer.",

Something for everyone's palette. I sat inside as it was a little too hot outside. The waitress offered her suggestions as she figured out this was my first time dining at the establishment. I felt the atmosphere was very classy. To start I had a punch bowl in which they change that drink daily, it was amazing. The plantains as the appetizer and the red fish as my entree. Those two dishes were great in taste, a twist on the Caribbean favors very fresh. It was just not enough food. I do not eat a lot and I was still hungry after the meal. I did order dessert the something sweet potato that was very good and a nice portion. I take off one star with the fact that they barely give you enough food for the price.",

Everything we ordered last night was great. I ordered the jerk pork over polenta... prefect! Pepper shrimp a must try, drink menu phenominal! I tried almost everything everyone ordered. We're all family! The mojito on point, punch rum bowl of the day... yum! Pina colada, Bootleg Smitty, rum old fashion all very good. Of course we tried a rum flight (Spanish). We started in the dining area due to a few unforeseeable mishaps we moved our party of 6 outside to the front patio for or meal. Ended the night in the back patio with our rum flight and cigar. Thank you so vey much for the amazing and unforgettable 1st time experience. Our server by the way was pretty awesome hats off to you Isaac G. We were definitely movers last night and you kept up with us all. Until next time...",

So if you're acquainted with the flavors of the Caribbean, The Breadfruit is quite familiar to the palate. They successfully deliver the \"essence\" of the Caribbean though masterfully created, complex, and exciting, unique cocktails and food items. While The Breadfruit definitely has the best cocktails in Phoenix, the atmosphere there provides a bit of an escape from the desert's valley. The ambiance is classy and sophisticated, yet warm and friendly, and very different from anything else downtown. It delivers the relaxed vibe and delicious flavors you'll recognize from the islands, and it's where I go in Phoenix, to escape Phoenix. It's party on the palate!!!",

I don't know if Jamaican people have their rice differently, but I like mine soft and fluffy. That's the one thing that sticks out in my mind.  It was a cute date place, and I love that they had neat artwork for sale from local artists on the walls. Reasonably priced, too.   Don't go out of your way to check this out, but if you're right there and craving some Jamaican... why not?",

One last chance for Breadfruit, we called for a reservation for a specific table but were told that table is only for larger parties, not for 2 diners.  That would be okay if some of the smaller tables were placed in better locations in the restaurant.  We decided to take our business to other restaurants that appreciate their customers.",

    "text": "OMG the pina colada. I have quite a bit of experience with Rum, and the pina colada at Breadfruit is the most balanced and delicious rum drink I have ever tasted. The fresh flavor with just the right amount of sweetness will make you completely rethink your perception of what is typically a sugary frozen concoction served with an umbrella.    Vibe was downtown cool with fun jamaican beats playing .Our service was excellent, so as far as the negative service reviews, either they have gotten it together or we dined on an \"on\" night. Our server was knowledgeable and made great recommendations, even suggesting drink pairings to complement out entrees.  The scallop appetizer was yummy - a little on the small side with 2 scallops so dont plan to share if there are more then 2 at the table. The jerk seasoning was yummy and had a great kick. I had the prawn curry and really enjoyed the entire dish - a generous helping of prawns with sauteed veggies and perfectly cooked rice and peas (again, many have complained about the rice but it was cooked nicely).  Our server suggested a mojito as a paring with the curry, and I took her suggestion. i get nervous ordering mojitos because some bartenders use mint syrup vs fresh mint, which is totally nasty, and many tend to over sweeten the drink. Not the case here. Again - perfect balance between tart and sweet and the best mojito I have had outside of my secret recipe!  For dessert there was a deep internal struggle between ordering the sweet potato pudding and enjoying another pina colada.  Since I was the driver the puddin won out. It was a unique dessert - not very sweet and nicely complimented by whipped cream flavored with even more rum.   I read a few poor reviews for the size of the desserts - OK people this is not the Claim Jumper.  The size was perfect for sharing and a completely appropriate size for a dessert.  If you want a ginormus hunk of cake you can go to Chilis or Claim Jumper and enjoy the side of diabetes. Seriously what is wrong with America. Soapbox.  All in all an amazing experience, and will definitely be back. Bill was about 90 for 2 of us, the food was very reasonable but with 2 cocktails each there was no way we were getting out of there under a hundy, That being said, the quality, flavor, and service made it more then worth it.",

Once arrive, we sat outside and ordered. We then had another group of 4 arrive who casually joined us on the patio to order a drink. The waiter's approach was abrupt and was very offensive to our friends.  He could have easily set up another 4 top and invited them to sit but he made them feel like they were in the way so they left. We then paid our drink tab and left too. We tried to speak with the owner but he was on the phone. Rum Bar should rethink their image and quick being so uppity and become a True rum bar.",

Cons: the man who seats patrons and takes reservations is made of ice. I've had  run ins with him before, but the most recent visit has convinced me to stop trying. He was very short with our party of two, as well as the other small parties before and after us. Once we were seated no one stopped by for over 15 minutes. For anything. Not water, not \"I'll be right with you\", nothing. It was as if we weren't there at all. It was a decent night for them, about half full. On our side (bar) there were two other people sitting at the bench by the window. At one point, two men walked through the bar and attempted to enter the restaurant in order to pass along a message to some friends eating dinner when they were stopped by the host and asked to leave as \"this is a very small establishment and there is no room for you\". The men handled it well, joking after the server walked away that apparently the place was \"at critical mass\". My companion and I waited a few more minutes, trying to appear as hungry and thirsty as possible, and then eventually gave up and walked out.  I recommend walking around the corner to Pomo.",

Not that it mattered apparently because after waiting 10 minutes we were escorted to the dining area, which had many open tables (so then why the delay?)  The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable, recommending several drinks, appetizers and entrees and didn't do the usual upsell of recommending the most expensive thing. So kuddos there. The plantains were excellent. The cocktails? A bit pricey for a small glass. $9-10+ Would probably have ordered more if they were closer to the 6-7 range. It's a psychological thing to be sure.   But anyway, I decided to go for broke and order the curried lamb (the most costly entree on the menu, $26) I love lamb and don't get it often, so I usually order it if I see it on a menu. But I was very disappointed when it arrived. It tasted wonderful don't get me wrong. But the portion! SO TINY!!! Literally 2 chops, 2 bites per chop. I've had much larger, just as succulent and delicious, at a much better price at other restaurants. When I looked at the amount of food others including my date were receiving for almost 10 dollars less, it was tough not to be annoyed. I spent most 45 dollars and left hungry   Cannot say I would return anytime soon.",

    "text": "We ate here last night before a show at Crescent Ballroom. We arrived a bit before 7pm and were a party of 6. We weren't the largest party there and definitely got there before a couple of the larger parties.   We didn't get our food until a quarter after 8 after watching the larger parties that were seated after us receive thiers.  I asked our server to bring us some to go boxes when she brought the food out, as well as the check, as we didn't want to miss the show we planned to watch and we didn't receive it for another 15 minutes.  I'm tempted to say that our server didn't place our order immediately or was too occupied with the trainee that was following her around to notice that we were in a hurry, even after I asked for the check.   The food wasn't bad, but will likely never eat here again and just spend time at the Rum Bar.",

I am deducting 1 star for not having rum cake on the menu at a Jamaican restaurant (totally blows my mind) I was told that the desert is rotational and that today's desert was carrot cake. Well we were here on Saturday and carrot cake was the desert. I'm taking a 1/2 star away for a the service being a tad slow.  Food is great taste authentic and is prepared with lots of love.  The rum punch changes daily, the one I tried was delicious!",

    "text": "This is my double review.    My wife and I participate in a monthly dinner club with a small group of 5 couples.   We go in alphabetical order, and each couple gets to pick a spot for dinner basically twice per year.  After doing a date night at Breadfruit not too long ago, we decided to make this the spot for our month and we all descended upon Breadfruit.   So this, friends, is the tale of two visits.   5 stars for our date night for sure.  My girlfriend and I ubered it that night so indulged in what I might call a wonderfully intoxicating evening :)   The selection of rums at Breadfruit and...duh...RUM BAR is nothing short of amazing.    In fact, they do a fine job of proving that you can make just about anything with rum.    I was fortunate to have sealed the deal with lucrative new client at work that week as well, so I treated us to a couple of glasses of $2,500-per-shot Appleton Estate Rum.   I must say my girlfriend was so smitten with my confident, seemingly incredible knowledge of rums that she accepted my marriage proposal......  OK OK, that last part was mostly fantasy.  We did get engaged AND married since that date night, but it's not because I'm a rum expert (I'm not).  It's not because I can afford a couple of $2,500 shots of rare rum either (I can't).  Regardless, try the rum cocktails and if you won the powerball, or are just having a great day, try some of the pricier rums you've never heard of before.    Of course, date night included a wonderful meal at a small table for two as well.  Love the atmosphere, and love the food.   We were seated promptly, shared a small plate, a couple of entrees and desert and it was all delicious.  We had lots of leftovers to enjoy later!      Our dinner club was mostly the same story.  We had some confusion when we arrived though.  The restaurant is small.  There's a small bar near the entrance, with a waiting area / lounge and one long table (which ended up being where our party was seated for dinner).  Then there's the dining room which is not much larger, and straight out from the back of the bar is a nice patio with a waterfall, some heaters and booth areas.  Sort of has a loungy feel outside.  Breadfruit also has a nice selection of cigars and this is where you can enjoy them.     The two of us enjoyed a cocktail outside while we waited for our table to be prepared, then were seated for dinner as the rest of our table arrived.   But you can't just go out onto the patio yourself, you have to be seated out there as well.  So it was a bit much for the hostess to first prepare a table for us outside, while also preparing a table for us inside.  We misunderstood some of the things she said as well, and it was confusing at first when we began to follow her to one place or another because we thought we were supposed to, but were then told to go back up front and wait, then be shuttled out back, then be shuttled back inside to our dinner table.  I again, very much enjoyed my dinner.  Kimberly and I shared the salt fish fritters (nothing short of awesome), and I had the Pimiento Wood Jerk Chicken, which was half a game hen.   It was rubbed with a house jerk seasoning and it was absolutely delicious.     I'd probably give the dinner club visit 4 stars, because of the confusion up front, but in my opinion the food and drink were once again top notch, so I'm leaving my tale of two visits as a 5 star review!  Enjoy Breadfruit!!!",

We enjoyed shrimp and cauliflower cake small plate (loved!), white fish and short rib (both delicious but the short rib was big winner). Rum drinks were incredible. I removed a Star because their signature dessert was literally one of the worst things I've ever tasted- horrible way to end such a delicious meal. I couldn't get the awful molasses taste out of my mouth and paid $9 for that awfulness. Sad way to end an expensive yummy meal- left a bad last impression",

They had a wide variety of drinks, and their menu was organized so everyone could find something they'd like. I had the velvet and vinyl, which I thought was flavorful and light, while others described it as \"perfume\"   I tried their take on an old fashion (rum old fashion) and they did a great job with that as well. I would highly recommend this place if you're just looking for a drink.   The atmosphere is definitely Jamaican, but I thought it was way too loud for what seemed like it could be an intimate dining experience.   Our server was very friendly, but She spilled one of our beverages on the walk over, and it took an exceptionally long time to get a replacement. I understand spillage as I am a clumsy fool, but the remake should have been much quicker.   We ordered the scallops to start -- they were delicious, but there were two of them. Definitely don't just order these if you're hungry. They had a slight kick  The shrimp - I literally felt like I had licked hell eating this dish. We ended up ordering a side of rice to go along with it, so if you're interested in trying this meal (which was delicious after you got passed the spice) you need to order some rice to soak up the spice.   Overall, it was a cool spot, but it to feel a little more Jamaican inside and offer a bit more to their food menu.",

I have been looking for  a restaurant that serves Caribbean cusine since I move to Phoenix. Amazing food, an ample selection of rums...try Cockspur Spice run or Mont Gay if you wanna try Barbadian rum. The elegant, flawless sophisticated island ambience invutes you to have seat and enjoy. At the end of the meal, you are presented wuth a post card of a picture of the Bar. You can either keeo it, or write it to anyone in the US and the restaurant will mail it fir you. Smart marketing. I sent mine to my family in Tx. Military discount is also offered.   Not necessary fir the whole family, but great foe mmeting friends, and date nights.",

After dinner we went out back for cigars on the patio. I'm not a cigar smoker, but my boyfriend was pleased with the selection. We found some comfortable chairs back there and eventually began chatting with the group on the neighboring couch while we enjoyed the mild Phoenix night and interesting decor. I can see myself coming back next time I'm in Phoenix.",

    "text": "In all it was an amazing dining experience.  We made reservations, which I strongly recommend that you do. Our server, Tamara, was a delight. This was a first time experience for each of us and she walked us though the menu and was very helpful and friendly.   Atmosphere and environment:  the decor and arrangement of the restaurant is really interesting. It's very tight quarters but comfortable  Service:  this is a big one for me. We experienced some good and some not so good.  - waited at the door for several minutes before anyone greeted us. The first person who did was the bartender who told us to sit and wait. Not unpleasant but I would expect a simple hello we will be right with you. Or at least some acknowledgment when we first walked in - table side server was great but things did slow down the longer we sat there. At one point I had to drink water from my boyfriend's glass because I had been empty so long.  - we had 3 menu items that were 86'd and we were not able to try them. Red snapper, a rum, and a dessert.  - we were told we could go out to the cigar patio by one server and order dessert, once we were out there, told by another server that we could not  Food/drink: - the food was amazing. It's a combination of spices and favors that I'm not used. I will say, it's not for everyone but it really is delicious  - it is a little pricey  - the drinks are amazing. We each ordered signature drinks and rum flights.  - dessert- kinda terrible. I can only assume it was authentic. Some kind of sweet potato pie with coconut and molasses. But we didn't like, at all.   In all, it was a great evening with friend and we made memories that we will cherish. I'm not sure that we will be back unless an opportunity arises. But I'm glad I did try it",

A pomegranate, black cherry, maple concoction was served and I was worried it might be too sweet but it packed a lot of flavor, and a good 'punch', haha! Sometimes a pre-mixed drink special at restaurants are either too sweet, watered down, or possibly even too strong. This one was delightful.   A couple in our group ordered a 2nd cocktail: Hot Buttered Rum. I enjoyed a sip and it was sooo good! On the next chilly night downtown I will be back to partake a glass or two.   I learned you can also enjoy a cigar here and I have to say I don't recall the place wreaking of cigar smoke so that's a plus if you're worried about leaving with a cigar smoke smell on your clothes.  Drinks were a bit pricey but the quality of what I tasted was great and I loved the ambiance. Dim lighting, chill, quiet. Perfect for a date night.",

    "text": "Had the pleasure of visiting the Breadfruit on Saturday night. Usually don't go out of my way to write a review unless i was really blown away by a place. Was able to make reservations the night before which was nice. I really find it astonishing that this place has only 3.5 stars for the place it is. I have to agree the place is a bit small but not to the point where you feel crammed. To start out the ambiance of the place is so relaxed and at the same time formal. Dim lighting, a fresh aroma and jamaican reggae tunes in the background. We were seated right away to our table and were served by Carly which i gotta say really made the night. She knew the food and drinks menu like if she was the chef and bartender herself. For the drinks i had the spanish gentleman and the shorty which i gotta say have probably been some of the best cocktails i've ever had. Started with the small plate scallops and then the woodfired jerk chicken. The combination of herbs and spices really come together for an incredible experience of flavor in your mouth. To my surprise i found out that the host himself Dwayne is the actual owner of the restaurant! When you see the owner as involved in his business that way you know the standards will be high. Ended up running a pretty big tab and have never felt better about paying for such a nice dinner. Please don't give your 1 star review as Joan P. did below just because the Jamaican Caribbean restaurant did not have your \"vegan options\" come on go eat your grass somewhere else smdh. Thank you Dwayne and Carly i will sure be seeing you again very soon.",

Drinks are strong and oh so good! My favorite drinks are the pina colada (trust me on this one - no syrups involved) and mojito, but I've definitely sampled most the bar menu. If you are a rum connoisseur, which I'm not, the bar is lined with what could easily be 100+ bottles of rum.  This is by far my favorite bar in Phoenix. I love it so much, I came for New Years! :) Parting words -Go to Rum Bar, enjoy the patio, meditate to some music, order some appetizers from Breadfruit and kick back with your rum beverage of choice.",

We were staying at the Clarendon Hotel and so we light railed it downtown (super easy!) and got there early to hang out in the bar for a while. Dwayne met us at the door and got us settled at the bar. Kristin was our bartender for the evening. Good thing too, since I had no idea there were so many Rums and Rum drinks (and so little time!). We placed ourselves in her capable hands and she paired drinks with our food all night long. We started a scallop appetizer (perfectly prepared) and I had the Tradewinds Swizzle & my wife had the Hemingway Daiquiri (which turned out to be her favorite drink of the night). After some time at the bar we moved to the dining room for a fantastic supper. I started with soup of the day then on to the jerk chicken. Fantastic. Kristen was True to her word and provided some really tasty drinks to go along with our equally tasty meal.  We'll definitely return for more of their delicious fare.",

Dwayne, Taylor, Tamra, Mila and Javier were outstanding. From walking in, to being seated, to answering every question, offering multiple recommendations....all good. And the energy is very positive.

The menu is a little pricey, so come ready to drop at least 100$ on a table of two if you have alcohol. The rum selection is amazing, they only have 3 beers, and a similarly abysmal wine list, but it's a rum bar, and they do rum better than any other place in Phoenix. The mojito is strong yet tasty, and the sheer number of different cocktails is startling. The wait staff is incredibly nice and knowledgeable about they're menu. They have a catch of the day plate, when I went it was salmon, and it was probably the best salmon I've ever had. Overall, Breadfruit is an absolutely PERFECT date night restaurant.

I brought a group of about 10 people for a happy hour, and as people trickled in, we were repeatedly asked if we had a larger group coming. When the full party had arrived, we were asked to sit in the back patio, i.e. smoking section (which was not a nice thing to do to my non-smoking friends), where there was no seating for groups larger than 5. I want to be clear: none of us had had anything to drink before our arrival. We were not belligerent, we were not rude. We were just treated that way.  We were also given conflicting messages about substituting different varieties of rum in the cocktails and were charged absurdly for the privilege of doing so... until we were told it was impossible because we would single-handedly ruin the owner's entire brand.  All in all, it's a good place to go for a cocktail. They're tasty, but it was easier and more pleasant to do business elsewhere. I haven't gone back, and I have no intention of doing so.",

Our first course was the Jerk Scallops and they were delicious. For my main course I had the chicken in a dark Caribbean sauce and it was amazing. My friend had the mussels and he loved them.   Now lets talk about the drinks. Actually, just have some and talk later. I would suggest asking your waiter or waitress for a full review. They will not steer you wrong.   The next time I'm in Phoenix, I will visit the Breadfruit. Perfection.",

Imagine our surprise & consternation when we were told we would NOT be seated until everyone was there.  The 3 of us could have been ordering drinks & enjoying appetizers.  Oh well.  While waiting outside I observed quite a few people similarly waiting and many empty tables, which didn't make sense to me.  So, first off, plan on being a tad irritated by the time you get to your table. (this would SEEM to be a major problem, but in spite of all the reviews complaining of this bottleneck problem, it continues)  I liked my meal, but in my defense I must say I have never had Jamaican cuisine before.  Still, I enjoyed it.  Everyone at our table was happy with their food, but it was a bit pricey and it was VERY noisy at our table. Conversation was almost impossible.  I don't know how that would work with that \"intimate\" scenario they are trying to create.  Our waiter was excellent, but he failed to mention the automatic 20% gratuity added to all bills for parties of 5 or more.  Seems like he should have, of course that might have cut back on his evenings \"haul\".  All in all, it was not such a relaxing evening.  When I think of Jamaica, I sure don't think of rigid rules and an unbending attitude toward life's little bumps, and the phrase \"Don't worry, be happy\" never came to mind.",

I can't remember the number of different kinds of rum they have over 100 for sure.... The Rum Punch was delicious, smoky but fruity. They had another drink made with rum and cream soda I really enjoyed as well!! They have a cigar lounge and the patio is nice to enjoy your rum and a nice cigar, if you are into that sort of thing. The restaurant as a whole has a great vibe and ambiance. Everyone, from bartenders to hostess to wait staff were all very friendly and helpful when choosing drinks and food.  If you like Jamaican food. That is the specialty. I'm not a huge fan. The food was good, but I just didn't find it to be off the charts fantastic. I had the Curried Goat, tasted good, but the goat was fatty and chewy. My husband had the pork belly... (big ol hunks of \"bacon\" essentially)... the first hunk was pure fat, no meat at all. The other slices had a good combo of fat and meat, but he was also not entirely impressed. Our other friends got the Jerk Chicken, which looked really good. Overall, the drinks are strong and delicious, but the food was overpriced and just OK. I would definitely come back for drinks though!!",

I love when they have music and I heard the Rum Bar is amazing.  I haven't been since that opened but I will now that I read the other reviews.  A rum drink and a spicy Jamaican Jerk chicken sounds divine. In Phoenix no less! Make reservations for weekends.",

The owner is lightweight a jerk though. I always sit at the bar and drink and never have been inside to eat. The drink menu changes w/solstice and thy are so yummy! This time I got the Bourbon Masquerade so sarsaparillayyy & cherrish and I luv it. My homegirl had the Tongue & Groove, oh my goodness, shut it down or turn It up, \"whatever blows ur hair back\" type of good. She did say though she probly wouldn't get another cuz the balsamic sits in ur stomach. We also got  a yummy app some smoked marlin dish. Totally not what you imagine but none the less tasty however last time we got the salted mackerel app and that is way better. Either way hands down numero uno spot on my place for beverages",

I was in Phoenix a few months before and all of my food was terrible so I was weary,  this place knocks it out of the park.  It was a little bit but spicy for me,  (could only eat half my jerk chicken because the run was so spicy), but it generally enhanced the flavors instead of decimated them.  Also I am NOT a rum drinker (don't like sweet and the sugarcane normally gives me a headache), but I had TWO cocktails here and they both were off the charts.  Be warned - the appetizer portions are small,  but it's fine for an appetizer - my jerk chicken and my colleague's salmon entree were plentiful.",

But, to be honest, we have never physically be IN to Breadfruit.  We only go to the Rum Bar and we LOVE this place.  I have been there 3 times. Once when I was a sardine and packed into the place without room to even breathe, once with my parents in the comfy window seating are and once with my husband on a romantic date for 2.  I loved it every time...and by the third time, I was told by my husband \"YOU HAVE TO YELP THIS PLACE NOW!\" and he then exclaimed \"I think this is my favorite food in the entire city.\"    My husband is not one to stake claim on anything less than spectacular (he is married to ME!)  so here I am giving them the highest rating and review I can muster...  The drinks are extremely tasty, unique, clever and strong. I love the rums and the free tastings we have had of the various types of rum.  This place has really opened my mind and expanded my knowledge. I like that the bartenders and staff always ask our names and take an interest in what we are eating, drinking, talking about and liking about life.  They are so kind!  But...and yes, there's a but...the Rum Bar experience won't be bringing us back.  It's the FOOD that is the big draw. What a great culinary experience. Every bite is a wonderful adventure. The spices, the mixture of fruits with the savory dishes, the fish...oh the fish!  We plan on going back again...and again!  The location is a little tricky to find, but if you found SENS/Turf, it's in the same block (nearly the same building), but just around the corner. Don't despair, just walk south and take a left (east) and you'll see Breadfruit on the left.",

I enjoyed a very excellent house punch the first time that had me waiting to return again.   Second time I came I had a tour of three very different drinks. There was actually a fourth but I didn't like it and the bartender graciously disposed of it and took it off my bill. She was genuinely hospitable and gave me no anxiety over it. I don't recall her name, I just know that she's from NM originally... her drinks were excellent. I really appreciated that she understood my preferred flavor profiles and considered that I wanted to enjoy multiple, contrasting drinks.  The owner tended the bar as well, a nice guy. I thought her drinks were very well-made, but I noticed that the owner was coaching her over, for example, drinks that were a couple ounces short. Just a note of their attention to detail at this place.  I don't agree with the person who called this place \"hoity toity\". He's probably satisfied with Phoenix's endless (but competent) beer and hamburger joints.   Since this is a review for Rum Bar, I think 5 stars is definitely appropriate. But to comment on the food-- I had two entrees, one of jerk chicken, another of.. a sort of fish. Probably escovitch. The rice a bit dry, jerk chicken dry, not flavorful enough. But the service was excellent and they seated us 10 minutes before their closing.",

    "text": "I would love to review this place, but we were never seated. I found this place online in a web search and decided to give it a try on Friday 3/22/19. My friend and I arrived around 8 pm and the atmosphere seemed quaint and low key. The restaurant wasn't busy and there were 4 people seated at the bar. We wait at the hostess stand and an employee asks us if we have reservations. We did not have reservations, but as I scanned the restaurant it was not crowded nor busy by anyone's definition. The employee asks us to take a seat and he will be with us. Another couple walks in and the scene repeats (they looked bewildered too because they did the cursory glance around the place and was also asked to wait). So we waited and continued to wait and reviewed the menu - which looked interesting, but not authentic. Eventually we left as we realized we were not going to be seated. As we are walking back to the car, I again look at the dining area (which can be seen through the windows on the front of the building) and it is not busy. So for wasting the time in my life that I can not get back, I give this place one star.",

The place is very loud and hard to hear the person next to you. The service was very in your face. Not relaxed like the Caribbean.  I still would recommend",

My main course choice of almond crusted white fish of some sort was not crusted, but was instead a small square of mushy fish on mushy paste with no flavor (supposed to be curried). My friend's poached quail looked so tiny. The dessert (black rum cake) I chose was over-rummed and had the taste and texture of an unsweetened bean paste with cranberries and a few walnuts on the side. A friend chose the small chocolate tart and liked it. Special menus should be tested on someone with taste before being executed on the public. With cocktails that were lackluster, it was an unsatisfactory $123 meal.",

We were seated close to the rum bar area which was neat to watch the bartenders mixing an assortment of rum cocktails ! The punch rum had a light hint that was unsweet and the lime sugar rum was freshly squeezed lime with rum! Of course had to have the sweet plantains with mango dip. The main meal was some sort of a beef stew with yucca potatoes rolled into a ball. The stew sauce was unbelievably tasty. Ended the night with a cigar and 15 year aged rum!",

It is a chill spot and very cool looking inside, they also have a cool back patio that you can hang out in as well.  I loved the look and feel of this place, but personally I am not a fan of super spicy hot tasting foods, so I only ate several of them scallops - the divers scallops themselves were cooked perfectly, but my mouth was literally en fuego!!! It seems like nearly all the food items here were hot/spicy, so this restaurant/lounge was just not a good fit for me.  I didn't try the jerk chicken, but the girls in the group complained it was dry, but a few of the guys seemed to enjoy it.  The staff here was awesome though ... Our server rocked the house and made sure we were well taken care of.  They do offer quite unique cocktails and they try to incorporate rum (spiced) into many of their drinks, so I tried a mojito to play it safe and it was good,  If you like spicy hot tasting Caribbean food/drinks this may be your spot!!!  Unfortunately, I do not, so I probably will not be back.  The food/drinks were reasonably priced because most of them cocktails and foods consisted of high quality ingredients.",

Unlike the first visit, my expectations were very high based on my previous experience. I was delighted when those expectations were not just met, but were exceeded. Thus far, everything I have tried on the menu has been excellent. The salmon is off-the-chart delicious and highly recommended. Also, do yourself a solid and save room for the sweet potato pie for desert. This has quickly become my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Can't wait for my next visit.",

I sat down & had a drink (non-alcoholic because it was a work day) in minutes, and my food arrived 15 minutes later.  The server was super friendly with lots of suggestions & tips.  She recommended a dish , and I had the fish specialty (escoviche?).  It was super!  I got the impression that the jerk chicken is very spicy, but with this dish the \"eater\" (me) can control the heat, since it's served with chiles and chile oil on the side.  I ended up going all in with the chiles.  Yum city!  I definitely want to go back and try some of the spicier food & have a cocktail as well.  It seemed like they have a small, but great selection of fresh juices and tasty rums to go well with the cuisine.  As a side note for anyone looking to go here.  It's in a great little spot of PHX, surrounded by other restaurants, and it is close to the light rail (for the lucky few who happen to live off that awesome 17-mile stretch of public transportation).  If you go, note that the place is tiny!!!  It seats maybe 20 people tops, but I think that quaintness adds to its charm.",

    "text": "The Breadfruit, as it is now, makes me sad.  Sweet Pea and I were early Breadfruit adopters, back when there weren't dozens of great restaurants downtown, back when it was a tiny place with no liquor license where you could BYOB, sit with 10 or so other people, and watch one guy cook your dinner.  Breadfruit has changed a lot, and not for the better.  I suggested Breadfruit for dinner before an event because we hadn't been there in a year at least, and Sweet Pea loves the Jerk Chicken, and I love the Coconut Curried Tofu.  So we get there, and like 3 separate people asked us if we have a reservation.  It hadn't even occurred to me to make a reservation for 6pm, even on a Saturday night, but the place was full.  After they told us that it will either be an HOUR for a table, or we can sit at the bar, we decided to sit at the bar since our event started at 7:30pm, and I generally don't mind eating at the bar anyway.  Unfortunately we ended up with me sitting on the end by the service well so it was sub-optimal.  Also, when I picked up the drink menu, there was a dead moth underneath that I had to brush away.  The bartender poured us some waters and asked us if we've been there, and we said yes.  Then Sweet Pea ordered a Dark and Stormy, which is a very typical rum drink, this being a rum bar and all.  The bartender says \"uh, we like to keep it on-menu...have you been here before?\"  AWKWARD.  No, we were lying.  We explained that we had, but that it had been awhile, and then we felt like crap.  After all the \"do you have reservations\" inquiries and now this, we felt unwelcome and out of place.  Rearding the Dark and Stormy, ever since they opened Rum Bar, they've been all uppity about their rum drink menu.  I have been there and tried to order a rum and diet and been smacked down hard because G-d forbid they serve such a pollutant as DIET COKE with their beloved rum.  Whatever.  But a Dark and Stormy is a CLASSIC rum cocktail!  The best they could offer Sweet Pea \"if he likes Dark and Stormys \" was a mojito which is NOTHING like a dark and stormy!  He got it, and I tasted it, and honestly it may be the best mojito I've ever had.  But still.  I tried to order an iced tea, but they didn't have that either.  I considered sparkling water but noticed it listed on the beverage menu, like all the rums, with its country of origin (Mexico) and decided against it.    We ordered the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls to split.  Then Sweet Pea tried to order the Jerk Chicken which has to be most peoples' main reason to go to a Jamaican restaurant, but they told him they don't have it, although it's on the menu.  What they did offer instead was a half chicken something or other, which is not on the menu, but is $5 more and doesn't even have jerk spice.  He decided to order the Jerk Pork and Polenta instead.    The Spring Rolls were pretty pedestrian (and small at 2 rolls split in half for $10), and it just made us miss the Patties they used to have.  They gave us a \"palate cleanser\" in between courses which was unnecessary but speaks to what this place now envisions itself as having become.  My tofu was the same as always- good, and Sweet Pea did really like his Jerk Pork, but we both miss the \"old\" Breadfruit, and with all of the restaurants that we now have downtown, we will most likely not be coming back.  It's a shame.",

We had: the Coconut Curried Tofu, Smoked Fish & Cabbage Canape, sorrel etc...  The rum menu is amazing, they use local produce/organic ingredients and I love the chic environment.  I must admit I wasn't too keen on the host up front; he was a bit abrasive to my guests (so you lost one star for that).  But overall, we had a good time in the outside patio and I would return to try some other things.",

The owner is very knowledgable about his subject, and will share all kinds of stories about rum and its history in the US if you ask (protip: ask why he doesn't stock Bacardi).   The cockails are excellent and made with only the best. Yes, they are a little pricey, but I've never had a really good cocktail under $10, so the prices are reasonable, considering.  Just overall a great experience: good service, interesting conversation, and fantastic cocktails and rum list. As a bourbon gal, I never knew rum could taste this complex and interesting. A definite must-go.",

I went in on a whim on 4/1. I truly did enjoy my meal and experience, only to come home and within a few hours experience one of the worst cases of food poisoning I have had in years.   The wait staff is very good at garnering the up-sale, they were very friendly and professional. I went with the Escoviche Fish recommendation (blacked fish with coleslaw and a grilled pineapple slice) , the Mango Lemonade and the Sweet Potato Puddin' (almost $50 for just me, I felt it a bit over priced, even with out my food poisoning).  Like I mentioned earlier, everything was good and very flavorful.  I was content and full on the way home, I was feeling nothing more than a good meal. And initially prepared to give it at least 3 stars.   It is almost 4 days later and I am still not back to normal.   I don't plan on stopping in anytime soon.",

    "text": "Rum Bar stands as one of the few places that transports you in terms of a cocktail lounge. I still have not found a place downtown that rivals the way in which Rum Bar focuses on its handcrafted cocktails and creating an atmosphere that is seductively easy to find yourself chatting with other patrons while also ruminating on your own thoughts.   I had really written off rum in terms of my imbibing repertoire because it often is done too saccharinely sweet and violently colored meant to get club drunk. Rum Bar wiped this away. The progression of drinks and their sophistication in terms of flavor profiles and what they do to showcase the sheer diversity and variety of rum is uncanny and intoxicating. The bartenders literally pull you into an experience that allows you to feel for a your short stint sipping that you might actually be shacked up in the Caribbean.  In order to indulge in this experience, it does demand that you spend more per cocktail but the quality is unparalleled that's why I suggest swinging by this place between 5-7pm to snag the happy hour. Remember the entire establishment creates intimacy and for that reason it easily gets filled fast and is better for not too large parties rolling through for the richness of rum. Reservations are key on busier nights and the small patio helps to only further the Caribbean vibe.  Also, not particularly a problem for me and actually a plus is the fact that for AZ it does have a dress code. Personally, if you think you can wear a ripped muscle tee to an elevated boozing establishment you might be a little ridiculous to begin with aka no post gym/ fake post gym active wear sporting. If you want a more casual atmosphere this would not be the choice for you. It is carefree inducing but not casual by any means and therefore, demands that you have to deal with some of the hangups and restrictions that come with this type of cocktail cruising.",

    "text": "I haven't had many experiences in Jamaican dining but if this is what it always tastes like, then I think I'm adding Jamaican cuisine to my list of likes. Nestled on a side street in Downtown Phoenix, The Breadfruit could just as easily be nestled in a corner of a beach village just waiting for diners to experience an intimate meal. The vibe here is definitely like that of a beach town. Everything is calm, cool and collected. The dining room is tiny and if you plan on coming with more than just one person, I definitely suggest calling ahead. It's cozy, with dim lighting and perfect for a date night.   Moving on to the food, those who can't handle a kick of spice to their cuisine should be warned! The menu doesn't lie when it says that the food is spicy. But if you can handle a major kick, the food is worth it. To start, I tried the mussels. I'm not typically a mussel fan but these were an exception. They had a Jamaican kick to them and the servings were generous in size. For my meal, I had the Jerk shrimp and holy moly did they have a jerk of spice to them! The shrimp came with pineapple and this long piece of plantain type bread and I ordered a side of rice. The meal was delicious.   Now be warned, the pricing here isn't cheap, however I am not letting that take away from the fact that the food was delicious, the atmosphere was wonderful and the cocktails made of fresh fruit and delicious rum were supreme. I will definitely come back and this time I'll take a cab so I can continue my post dinner cocktailing at RumBar next door.",

    "text": "Wow. I really hated this place.   Our server was also the bartender. (I ate there last night 1-30-12.) She was either terribly slow or terribly overworked. Either way-- not my problem. She came to the table and gave us a canned speech about \"what she really likes on the menu.\" Of course, wow, everything she liked numbered amongst \"most expensive\" on the menu. Big surprise.   (If you read other reviews on Yelp, you can read about the pushy service. Just awful.)  She talked at us, and not to us. When we were done ordering, she-- in constant sales mode-- pushed the Rice & Peas, which is Jamaican rice and beans.   I love rice & peas, so even though I didn't like our pushy server, I ordered anyway. When the food arrived, my companion and I each took a bite of the rice and-- if I would have had a napkin-- I would have spit it out.   The flavor could only be described as \"odd\"-- and it was served room temperature. We both agreed- independently of one another-- that the rice was inedible.   Gosh, the way our server upsold us, you would think it would be at least edible.   I ordered the soup of the day. I was told it was red snapper with vegetable. It was a fish broth with vegetables. There was no red snapper. So why was \"red snapper\" included in the title of the soup? I have no idea.   So they basically boiled some fish heads, put some veggies in, and made $7.25 profit on a $7.50 soup. I was pissed.   Of course, I would have liked to tell our useless server / bartender about this, but she never stopped by to ask us how our meal was-- NOT ONCE.   When the food was dropped, we ordered another round of drinks and did not get them until our meal was almost finished.   The manager came and cleared our plates, so I told him. He just smiled and basically told me it was my fault for not enjoying the overpriced rice and soup.   Plaintains were oven-roasted and tasty. Very stingy portion though.  I would say about half a plaintain per order. These people have their food cost in control baby! Don't serve any food! That's the key.  The only thing that was good was my companion's jerk chicken. It was excellent, actually. As far as drinks go, the overpriced Mojito Vanilla was also good.   So here's the deal: If you are a hipster foodie who likes the idea of eating overpriced Jamaican food-- even though you and your knit cap has never even been to Jamaica-- with stingy portions, and poor service...this is your place.   They missed on every level. Horrible.",

    "text": "I finally had the opportunity to check out this place along with some fellow yelpers this past Thursday. ( International Supper Club = Fun) The place is small and very quaint. Think of cute but kinda expensive date night.  Let me start off by saying that although the food was good, the price didn't quite match the portions.  I started off with the the pina colada as my drink of the night, which was shaken and not blended. VERY GOOD! I will say that the drinks are worth the price. It was $9 but it was good and strong so one was plenty. The mussels that were ordered for the table were quite good. It did have the smokey flavor and the broth that was left was good for dipping the bread in. Good eats.  I next ordered the oven roasted plantains for my appetizer, which were very good, however I received 6 slices and it cost  $5.00 or roughly $1.20 per slice. Plantains themselves before cooking  are a decent size however  the slices I received were just a normal small slice you would get at any restaurant that has them as an appetizer. I have had plantains at other places and received much more and the cost was much less.  For my main course, I ordered Scallops. You receive 4 average size scallops and a side of rice and peas. The scallops were good but I am not sure that they were $22 good. Maybe $16.50. They were nice and spicy and they did melt in your mouth but other than that, there was nothing extra special about them.   Some people ordered dessert and I knew that it was going to be bad. Not the dessert but the cost of the dessert and the portion they received didn't match one bit. $9.50 for the smallest piece of upside pineapple cake I have ever seen. $4.50 maybe but the fact that it cost more than our drinks, yowza. Although everyone seemed pretty pleased with their meals, they were a little surprised by how much everything cost in comparison to the portions. I am not asking for some huge over the top portion but still, this place is not frou-frou enough to charge what they charge.",

    "text": "We all decided, on a whim at 9;00 pm on a Friday night to eat here because two members of our group recommended it with gusto. So, it's Friday night and we expected to walk straight in and find a table. Not exactly. We just hoped that we would be able to get fed sometime before midnight. We were very  fortunate only to have to wait for about 35 minutes. We were seated at an outside table. Perfect position as the weather was mild and the area is filled with interesting people. This restaurant focuses well on two things-rum cocktails and authentic Jamaican food. They have both down to an art. We were very fortunate to have a pair of waiters with style and a sense of humor. I know that many waiters can get a reputation for being a little standoffish, but our waiters seemed to actually enjoy what they were doing. They turned a very good meal into a memorable experience. So, why am I only giving this place four stars. I found two bones in my mackerel reduction. As this was a stew-like dish, I was not expecting any bones and I was very surprised when I pulled them out of my mouth expecting simply to find something vegetable-based that was a little tough. We were tempted with dessert and, even though the portions were small, the taste was enough to complement and complete the meal. This place definitely deserves another visit. (Review #200)",

Drinks were visually stunning, strong and delicious. Rum is the ONLY liquor they offer but they have eclectic drink recipes that will please everyone in your party (I myself am a Bourbon and Vodka girl). Lots of buzz and great energy in the bar area.  CONS:  I made reservations a week in advance for a team dinner. I specifically chose this place for two out of four people in my party (one being myself) to have the curry goat, only to be told that the farmer they usually source ther goats from, was simply out of goats and therefore, they hadnt had goat on the menu for months. I informed our waitress that they should take this item off the website and menu. Furthermore, it is Business 101 to Only use one supplier. One of the persons in my party is Apache Indian and said they have tons of goats. Quite frankly we were both dumb-founded. I ordered a second dish to go... and was also told I was lucky because they don't allow TO GO orders because they cant guarantee the food quality once it leaves the establishment but they would \"allow it\" since I had already eaten there. To that I say again, \"I'm dumbfounded.\" Guess you wont be able to order on UberEats, Post-mates, etc.",

The smoked  marlin appetizer was tasty but portion is laughably small.    You cannot bring a bottle of wine from home here so expect to pay for some fancy drinks.  They specialize in rum drinks. The sweet potato desert was amazing. Kinda tasted like a cross between banana bread and a macaroon.    I am unaware of any Jamaican places in los Angeles so this place really stands out as unique.  Loved the Jamaican background music.   When you have great food ambience and service you have found the perfect place.  5 stars.

You MUST sit at the bar though. In 5 years and tens of thousands of dollars spent on various meals and drinks at hundreds of places- THIS is my go-to, and favorite place.",

We showed up as a party of 7 with no notice on a Friday night and they got us seated pretty quickly, I do recommend though making a reservation or calling ahead if you plan on taking a larger party as it is a pretty small place. It was an unexpected stop on our tour though. The rum drinks are amazing! Our server was very knowledgeable and made great suggestions for everyone at the table who had questions. I had a Hemingway Daiquiri which is one of my favorites and it was excellent!",

I got the Red Stripe Curry Prawns with rice and roasted vegetables. The spice was perfect - they are known for their jerk spice, after all!

    "text": "I've had mixed experiences at the Breadfruit & Rum Bar before, but this last one has pushed me to the \"maybe come for drinks, but definitely not food\" category.  The problem is the service and the speed at which the food comes out.  Now, I understand if the restaurant is busy that it may take the kitchen a little longer to get the orders out, but to wait 1.5 hours before ANY food hits the table is beyond ridiculous.  The waitress never kept us abreast as to what the hold up was, and we had to hunt her down in order to find out what happened to our order.  When we finally got to her, she went and checked with the kitchen and said it'd be 10 more minutes. More than 20 minutes later, the food came.  This situation could have easily been handled by a) letting us know that the kitchen was very backed up, and b) offering to bring us something to eat in the interim.  Neither of those things happened, so we were left twiddling our thumbs in hunger for waaaaay too long.  By the time the food finally arrived, everyone was a bit cranky, so the joy of the atmosphere had been spoiled.  It's really too bad because the food (once you actually get it) is actually quite good.  We had the guava pork belly, red curry shrimp, and jerk pork and all were quite delicious.  Same goes for the drinks.  If you're a rum fan, and particularly a Caribbean rum fan, then you will absolutely love the cocktail menu.  They even serve a rum punch of the day, which the bartenders change daily, so that is always fun.  I wish we had had a better service experience at the Breadfruit, but alas it was not to be had, and without a beach view to distract me from the unnecessarily long wait for food, this has pushed me overboard and is probably the final time we visit the island food at the Rum Bar.",

As a table we shared the best mussels Ive had since diving for them ourselves in New England as a kid. For the main course, I had the jerk prawns, holy spicy Batman! So good. My husband is notoriously picky about his food, but he rather enjoyed the molasses fried lollipops he got. Overall, everyone was very pleased w/ their food choices.  Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere was very unassuming, and chill.  If youre in the mood for something a little different, i recommend going here.",

The bar is separated from the restaurant by a small wall but both are quaint and cozy.  The drink list hosted many unique offerings. We ordered a vanilla mojito and then our favorite, a Dark & Stormy (ginger beer with Gosling's rum). Oh my God....the best mojito I have ever had. A little on the sweet side but such a unique flavor with quality vanilla extract in it. I can't wait to come back and try the food!",

The food has good spice but I found dishes way too sweet and portions are astoundingly tiny on the whole. The jerk chicken was the exception, tasty and well proportioned with tasty beans and rice.

I think they have something like 90 varieties of rum.  YUM!  Plus, I love me some island-like drinks!  However, seeing that I can't review one without the other, I have to give Rum Bar only 3 stars due to the food, which is *bleh* at best.    I should probably add my disclaimer now:  I am from the Bronx, NY, and have been eating authentic Jamaican food my entire life, so my expectations may be a bit higher than someone whose never really had the real deal.  Now that that's done, on to my review.  I tried the Breadfruit when it first opened up a few years ago, and wasn't impressed with the food then.  Their \"beef patty\" was this square shaped thing that was nothing like the True beef patties that I get from the Jamaican bakeries when I'm at home in the Bronx.  I can't even remember what else I had, which speaks to the \"memorability\" of this food.  Soooooo, fast forward to October 2011.  My girlfriend had a birthday gathering at the Rum Bar, which is how I ended up there.  I was mainly drinking, and only wanted a little something to have on my stomach (you True drinkers know what I mean!), so I just got an order of plantains, and even those were on the dry side, like they had been overcooked a bit.    I will definitely hit up the Rum Bar again for the cocktails, but I'll make I sure I eat before I go!",

The concept of the bar is awesome and the drinks sounded great, but the overall execution was terrible. Really, this rating is completely based on service and maybe I should give it 2 stars as their drinks are very good, but that's about it.  Upon arriving at Breadfruit/Rum Bar, we were told to sit anywhere in the bar area and someone would be around to serve us. There were about 20 or so people in the whole place (restaurant and bar), so it didn't seem that busy. However, it took about 10 minutes before someone came over to take our drink order or even acknowledge our group. Not a good sign.   After we made our order or Estate Mai Tai, Dark and Stormy, Mojito Ponganot and French Caribbean Breeze, two of which were the server/bar keepers suggestions, we waited and checked out the decor. The ambiance inside is dark and relaxed, but made reading the menu almost impossible. Others around us and our group were using cell phones to try and read the menu, it was so dark. I get trying to give a place a vibe, but can we get a little bit of light to read?   Drinks Arrive! These were amazing. I had very high expectations given the selection of rum and narrative behind everything we ordered, but was still impressed. Drinks were well blended and decently strong. The Mai Tai was off the charts and might have kicked my ass had I gotten another.  Which brings us to the next drink, that never happened. Our server/bar keep came by mid way through our cocktails and asked if we wanted a second order, but given the time it was taking us to get through the first one, three of us waited and one ordered a Red Stripe.  15 minutes pass and most of us are either done or close enough to order another, but no server. Drinks done and our group is waiting for another 10 minutes. No Red Stripe and no second order. What the hell. Now we are sitting around waiting just to see how long it takes, but after 10 more minutes, we give up and go to the bar to get our tab. 10 more minutes go by and we finally have our bill, but there is no breakdown of what we ordered. It's just part of good service to always bring a breakdown of the bill and we were curious to see if the Red Stripe we ordered and never got was on there.  Sure enough, after 10 more minutes of waiting to get a breakdown of the bill, there was the unicorn Red Stripe. Getting that off the bill was another 10 minutes and finally, we were allowed to leave.  I'm not sure what happened that evening, but there is no reason for poor service. The place was not that busy and they were clearly not understaffed  based on the amount of staff roaming around. The staff seemed preoccupied with assisting those sitting directly at the bar instead of the lounge seating behind the bar stools and the bar appeared to be getting great service. I'll give it another try for the drinks and sit at the bar, but it's with hesitation and low expectations of service.",

Since then, it realllly seems like they've made large strides in the service area. A group of us went on First Friday last week with the Mardi Gras festivities the same night. They were slammed, and totally able to balance it all. Dramatic improvement guys, it's one of my new favorite spots to check out in downtown!",

The plantains were cooked perfectly with a little crisp on the edges and a little soft from grease in the middle.  The scallops (2) were huge and tasted like there were fresh, not frozen.  I didn't care for the shrimp and the peas.  They were ok, just didn't do it for me.  There were some banana bread sticks that were included also.  A little rubbery but the flavor was dead on.  I'd go back for dinner.",

Our server was friendly but a little pushy and managed (i know it's our fault) to up-sell everything. It's a BYOB place so we brought beer but couldn't drink it since we were outside. So we all ordered a fruit drink including a whole coconut for it's water then fruit.  The appetizers were really small for the price and although the mango avocado spring rolls sound delicious, they weren't that tasty. I ordered the coconut curry tofu which was great and not spicy (the jerk chicken was too spicy for me).  Our dinner for four came to $120 before tip - pretty pricy since we didn't have alcohol.",

    "text": "Partner and I came here at 5:40 on a Thursday. I had their soup of the day, which happened to be a red snapper \"bisque,\" and confused me greatly by being simply a seafood soup. A bisque, by definition, is creamy. Nevertheless, it came packed with spicy, fishy goodness, and whole peppercorns! I think the chef got lucky that I really enjoy peppercorns and fish broth. He came out later in the meal, asked if I enjoyed it, and said that he worried it would be too \"fishy.\" Nice guy, btw.  Their scallop appetizer was well-cooked (nice jerk sear on the outside, almost gooey inside), but rather pricey (12.50). The jamaican spinach empanada was seasoned well and baked rather than fried, but wasn't anything to write home about.  The real highlight of the meal was the carrot juice and strawberry lemonade my partner and I ordered. Fresh and (mostly) local, which I appreciate.  If I could, I would give this review a 3.5 star rating. It wasn't quite 4, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt because we need more environmentally aware eateries that give their food a personal touch.",

    "text": "I went to lunch at The Breadfruit.  It was around 1:35pm  when my lunch date and I entered the tiny but warm restaurant.  We had the place to ourselves.  Our waitress was great.  Right away she explained the menu and sold us on a couple of mocktails.  I had the Carrot juice and my date had the Kiwi Pineapple Quencha.  The carrot juice had coconut milk, nutmeg, and vanilla mixed in.  It was tasty.  I love anything with coconut milk even carrot juice.  My guest's drink had kiwi and pineapple nectar and was garnished with a piece of sugar cane.  My guest gnawed on the sugar cane to give it a whirl.  She liked her drink too.  We split a House Tropical Salad to start.  The greens and veggies were very crisp and the fruit was juicy.  The ginger poppy seed vinaigrette was refreshing and I couldn't place the zing to the dressing.  I asked our waitress and she informed me it was the orange zest I was tasting.  Of course.  I ordered the Jerk Chicken and my guest ordered the Coconut Curried Tofu.  The chicken was wonderfully spiced.  The coleslaw was not wet.  Which I liked.  Much more healthier.  The roasted corn had a hint of something else.  Maybe coconut.  The corn just had a nice flavor.  I haven't enjoyed corn on the cob that much in a long time.  I saved the grilled pineapple for last and it was worth the wait.  My date's tofu was excellent.  It was like tender pieces of meat.  Again with the coconut.  She let me have a taste.  Yum.  I am glad I finally made it to The Breadfruit.  I knew it was there, just never got around to it.  I am glad I went.  I will be back and I will add it to my lunch rotation.",

Would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something that is not too sweet. Atmosphere is great for a \"date night\" but considering we had an infant with us, I would leave the kiddies at home (I know that may be common sense, but since we are out of towners, our little one had to come).  Tried the avocado and plantains appetizer which was very unique. Who would think to add these two items together?  Brilliant.  My husband tried the jerk pulled pork and if you like food with a kick, I would try something different and give this a try, as it will give you a kick!  Ended my meal with a butter drink of some sort, which was dessert in liquid form.  A creamy liqueur drink, but well work it.  Left off the sweet potato pudding dessert which also was unique and quite delicious.  All these items were recommended by the server, so A+ for the recommendations and listening to my likes in order to find the perfect matches from the menu.  Great date night restaurant and I would recommend sitting outside on a nice warm evening!",

It's delightfully clean and crisp, interior is tastefully decorated, very hip.  The food is fresh-fresh-fresh and delicious.   Fried plaintains, yum.   Tofu in a curry sauce, yowza!   Oh and this delightful iced - um - tea?  It was more like a clove tea perhaps, very spicy.   Had to alternate between sips of that, and water.    But overall: a very friendly, inviting place; service was lovely and attentive and everything was great.  The portions were large so I had leftovers for lunch the next day, too.  Note that there is an inexpensive corkage fee on beer or wine, so bring your own.   Oh and free corkages on Tuesdays!",

We ordered an appetizer of calamari, but it was not the deep fried version, rather, it was just grilled squid with a fruity/floral sauce. The appetizer has won a few awards and we know why! Squid usually has a rubber-like texture, but the appetizer we had just melt in our mouths. It was definitely pricey for the amount you get, but worth the experience of fresh squid at its finest. I ordered the pulled pork over polenta. I wasn't a fan of how smokey the pork was, but the meat itself was very tender. There was way too much sauce poured over the polenta which made a weird texture, but would have been great with out it. My husband ordered a tropical fish dish which was excellent. I will definitely try this place again. Wasn't a fan of my dish, but look forward to trying something else on the menu!",

    "text": "My friend and I wanted to try something new that would be a change from the normal food-on-the-go meals we eat during the week. So we made the trek on into Phoenix, and surprisingly found the place on the first try. (Yes, the signs on the main street helped.) It is a cozy place (read \"small\"), but it has fun eclectic decorations and I loved the little lights along the window.   The waitress was very friendly, and we were soon set up sipping drinks. I loved the ginger beer - so spicy and yummy for a drink that looked like hazy water. Never one to turn down plantains, we ordered the avocado and plantain spring rolls. The chutney was good and I liked that the rolls weren't insanely greasy, but they didn't seem that special to me, nothing popped out.   The brown stew chicken worked well as a comfort food, but again, there wasn't anything that would make me order it again. What fascinated me was my friend's chicken and dumpling - it had good flavor, and at the bottom of the plate was a large round solid thing of ... well, something. I had never seen a dumpling like it, and I have to admit to being skeptical. But when you got a cut of it, used it to wipe up some sauce, the dumping was great! It was heavy, solid food, and yummy as well. The kind of food I'd go out once in a while for and come back with a full tummy, wanting nothing more but to lay out on the couch.  We ordered coffee and shared the sweet potato pudding for dessert. The two complemented each other perfectly. I love sweet potatoes, and this pudding was no exception. All in all, I liked the dumplings, loved the dessert, and guzzled the coffee to stay awake for the ride home.",

I ordered the Jerk Prawns (which cost $14.50) and I received 5 medium sized prawns on a skewer. Not only was I disappointed in the lack of prawns, they were terribly overdone. Very dry. The flavoring was pretty ok, but couldn't make up for the dryness.  It also came with coleslaw, grilled pineapple and corn and festival bread which wasn't bad. I sampled my friends tropical salad ($7.50) which had yummy dressing and seemed more filling than my pricier meal.  I was pretty hungry and I left the restaurant feeling like I needed to have a snack. I don't mind small portions if the food is really good, but this place just didn't have it.   I might consider coming back here for yummy drinks, but it's doubtful that would be enough motivation to bring me back in.",

I have eaten a fair amount of Caribbean food, and I while I thought this place was good for Phoenix, I was not all that impressed. Most of the food was tasty, but the vegetable sides that came with the meals were just cabbage and simple peppers, WTF! No flavor! And the dumplings looked like something I wouldn't want anywhere near my food. It nearly spoiled my appetite. And maybe they shouldn't stress how much everything is localy grown and organic. It's a Jamaican restaurant in Phoenix! How local could it be? Well, that point was answered when our waiter had to clarify the locality of a few items. One more thing, what is up with the $5 bottle opening fee?! I was going to bring a bottle until I read that.  I am sure to eat here again. If the menu changes seasonally and they introduce some new items throughout the year, I will probably revise my review to be a little more favorable. If nothing changes, I will take the rating to a 3.",

They seem to have gotten their stuff more together, but the food still came across as \"bland but fresh\", which is sad. Fresh food should be tastier.

The atmosphere and vibe at the bar are relaxed and tropical.  The decor matches the theme with distressed woods and bright colors. All that's missing is a whiff of ganja and you'd be in Jamaica. I ate in the bar area but the menu comes from \"Breadfruit\", the adjoining restaurant.  I enjoyed the food.  I had the jerk prawn avocado salad and boy was it spicy!  The menu indicates heat so be aware they aren't kidding. The salad was huge with lots of avocado and prawns.  This could be a meal for most people.  I also had the Jerk chicken and it was well prepared and also spicy.  The sides were colorful, a cabbage/pineapple slaw.  I had a few glasses of local wine by the glass at happy hour prices and enjoyed it.  Who knew Arizona made wine? The bartender was friendly and attentive and the crowd eating at the bar was chatty and friendly as well. I will definitely go back the next time I am in the area.

    "text": "Well hello, Yelp, long time no see.  I'm back now but in a different city and I'll try to get back in the swing of things. So here goes...first review in Phoenix: The Breadfruit.  - - -   The owner of the Breadfruit can tell you where the strawberries they use in their fresh made strawberry lemonade come from. And the answer isn't Costco.    I went in at kind of an odd time, 4:30 on a Saturday, after a day of apartment hunting downtown.  There was a duo and another solo diner both sitting inside. The server was friendly and offered great suggestions. The weather was perfect so I sat outside at one of the handful of tables on the sidewalk.  The curried chicken and dumpling were fantastic: served with grilled plantains that tastes more like a potato than fruit,  and fresh bell peppers. The dumpling was dense and went great with the curry sauce. Although the rice and peas that the server suggested were delicious, I think the entree could have stood on its own.  The server picked up on the fact that I was in no rush and she was friendly and attentive while not rushing me. A while later a guy who worked there came outside to eat his meal before the dinner crowd arrived.  We started talking about the book I was reading, Food Inc, and he told me about the restaurant's goals to provide thoughtful, local food. Turns out I was talking to Duane, the owner, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear him tell me the strawberries in my strawberry lemonade come from the farmer's market around the corner and were grown in Yuma. There aren't nearly enough business owners who care enough to invest the time and energy into such pursuits. We talked a little more about our common love for conscious eating and how meals should be experiences, not quick fixes to fill you up.  He explained that this is why his restaurant does not package anything to go. I can respect that. If you want their food you're going to eat it fresh and you're sure as hell not taking it home to microwave leftovers.  A chef/businessman with values who eats his own meals, talks passionately about being involved in the growth of downtown and can tell you where his food comes from...I'm a fan.  Did I mention the Sweet Potato Pudd'n and vanilla ice cream? <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FUh.Maze.Ing&s=e5cbc97be2501a7503fdde8bb50418d9e9c28dedc06dcf7bc1035120dcec5b76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uh.Maze.Ing</a>.",

    "text": "If you want to  spend more money than you planned by sipping amazing rum, enjoying flavorful Jamaican food, and enjoying a small slice of paradise in Phoenix, Arizona, then this is the spot! My friends and I first came to the Breadfruit and Rum Bar last September to celebrate a birthday, and have had a monthly \"Breadfruit\" date ever since. We begin our three-to-four hour visit with the Rum punch of the day, before enjoying an amazing Rum Old Fashioned as we sample the various delectable items on our small plates: Pepper Shrimp, Rum Sea Scallops, Jerk Shrimp and Johnny Cakes, and Plantains and Mango dip. Isaac, the most knowledgeable king of service, makes everything on the menu sound so tantalizing we usually end up ordering a special as well. They literally mean small plates, hence why we order so many for six people, but while the portions are small in size, they are mighty in flavor! For the main course, while imbibing the Garrison cocktail, we usually enjoy the Pimento Wood Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork and Polenta, or the Red Stripe Curried Shrimp with a bowl of the Saturday Evening Soup. The soup changes every Saturday just like the punch, so we enjoy the Saturday surprises whenever we visit. We usually retire to the outdoor patio and cigar lounge to enjoy the stars, the smell of cigars, and a few sips of The Real McCoy and Mt. Gay Black Barrel before drawing the evening to a close, unless they have hot-buttered rum! The final moment of our visits are punctuated by intense scrutiny of our digital calendars as we save the date for the next month's visit.",

I have had trout all over the world and ALMOST asked for the chef and his recipe to find out what their prep was. Anyways, I was obviously not happy with the dish and the server seemed to careless about my displeasure. Menu wasn't deep so couldn't pivot elsewhere...   Also, I swear the floors were a little dirty. It was dark but I could still tell.   I'm not the biggest rum fan....although the proximity of this place to where I live could have made it a prime candidate for a restaurant I frequent.   It's whatever",

Dwayne and Danielle are good people that actually care about the product they serve. They buy veggies from the farmers market!! We once had a field trip to visit and volunteer on a local farm that they buy their chicken and eggs from. The food may not be for everyone, although I loved it, but you should at least stop in for a drink. Dwayne is a True mixologist, his drinks are amazing. He's from Jamaica and uses a lot of unique ingredients in the cocktails. My favorite was their Pina Colada, with fresh pineapple and coconut milk. The atmosphere is relaxing, with reggae music playing. Check it out!",

However, I am not sure that multiple 151 rum drinks necessarily bode well for the drive home.  Regardless, that is the least of this restaurant's problems. Service is poor and the food was worse. All four of the people in my party received food that was not hot, presumably because the waitress let the food sit in the kitchen too long when ready. When she was told our food wasn't hot her reply was that she would yell at the chef...not improve our circumstance. Additionally, my jerk chicken was dry and overdone as well as no longer hot.  Breadfruit and Rum Bar, too cute, poorly managed, and bad food preparation. No thanks",

The bar only sells Rum Cocktails, not a rum drinker but I had read that the bartenders are awesome and can pair their cocktails to your liking. Bartender Zero was rude, shamed us for suggesting that he recommend one of their cocktails that would compare to a Manhattan. He was borderline obnoxious. Fortunately Nick saved the day, explained the menu and helped me pick out a cocktail. One of my friends tried their punch of the day but the other half of our party was so put off by the initial bartender they refused to order so our stay was cut short. In the end I really liked my cocktail but getting there was a little dramatic. I thought the scene was cool so I will definitely go again after I make sure Bartender Zero is not working....",

    "text": "I've had this establishment bookmarked on Yelp for some time now and finally had the chance to check it out this weekend. I had high hopes that this place would be amazing, or at the very least full of authentic Caribbean flavors. While the experience wasn't horrible, it wasn't exactly good either.  The restaurant itself is fairly small, and can get quite loud due to poor acoustics, not ideal for a romantic date date although I thought it did have potential. The service was fantastic and some of the cocktails that we ordered were decent. The rum old fashioned in particular was delicious, most of the other cocktails we tried were too sweet/syrupy for my liking.  The food wasn't bad, but wasn't great. For apps we ordered the scallops which were probably the highlight of the entire meal. The jerk shrimp and johnny cakes were a bit bland. We both ordered the pork and polenta as mains (since they were out of the brown stew beef brisket, which was my first choice). The pork tasted like regular BBQ pulled pork, and not the best version of it that I've ever had. It had a nice smokey flavor, but if I wanted BBQ I would have just gone to BBQ. For dessert they only had one option, the sweet potato pudding/pie. It was absolutely awful!! I have never met a dessert that I did not like, and usually I enjoy sweet potato and always love coconut, so I was shocked that we didn't even eat half of it. The only saving grace on the dessert was the ice cream, but you can't exactly mess up on scooping ice cream.   Maybe their other dishes are more memorable but I don't think we will return to find out. I would possibly return for the cocktails if I were in the area. The price was quite steep as well, and I don't think the experience warranted it.",

Each plate had only enough food to leave a colony of ants hungry. A spoon full of peanut butter would have left me more satisfied than the terrible excuse of a plate there.

They were amazingly good.  One criticism - when they say prawn, they just mean bigger than average shrimp. I understand this is common in certain areas of the US and the rest of the world, but the starter was slightly different than we expected.  Nonetheless, it tasted amazing.  We had the rum punch of the day to drink - VERY tasty.  I would go back just to have the \"prawns\" and rum punch.  Dinner - I ordered the short rib stew - their take on a beef stew, essentially.  It was VERY tasty.  Really, I could've eaten more.  No really.  I wish they had given me more.  The portion was smaller than I expected for the price.  The flavor was nice - and spicy - and amazing - but I still hadn't tasted anything that reminded me of the Jamaican food I had back in Chicago.  I know that doesn't necessarily mean anything, but...  Todd had the Mussels.  These should really be on the starter menu.  I'm not sure how someone can make a meal out of 10-15 mussels.  There's no side and two small pieces of bread.  Again, for the price, it seemed strange.  Also - while the mussels were tasty and wonderful, they were larger than normal, and neither of us cares for the larger mussels.  We were not thrilled, and for a birthday celebration, it was underwhelming, but we had a nice time (because the company was good).  I'm just not sure our experience was worth the money we spent.",

When I tried to order an item off the menu, I was told that that's a different plate on Fridays and Saturdays with a price tag $10 higher. huh?  We were there exactly one hour before the entrees came out. Everyone sitting around eyes had received their entrees and or had already left. when the food came out, it was absolutely delicious. but the portions were small, leaving me hungry which almost never happens. The waitstaff we're just not friendly enough and definitely did not make us feel welcomed.

    "text": "After dining here last Thursday, I would classify this as a \"special occasion\" place due to the prices and ambiance; this was a surprise since I did not get that impression when reading the reviews.  Or maybe it was because the couple of other Jamaican places I have been to have been dives?  I loved the classy intimacy of this restaurant.  It gave me the feeling that I was having dinner at someone's house who was both a great cook and also had great taste in decor.  The impression I have of Jamaican food is that it has really strong flavors but I found the food here to be a little bland.  I got the jerk shrimp which didn't look very blackened or like it even had a rub on it.  However, when I tasted it I was surprised and pleased that there was actually a good spicy kick to it.  This was by far the best part of my meal.  The sides it came with tasted good but were nothing special.  I did really love their cocktails but I wrote another review of the bar since that is a separate business listing.  I like the fact that there was so much seafood on the menu (try the mussels, they are yummy) but I think someone who is more of a meat eater might be disappointed.  I was also surprised there was no goat on the menu - don't Jamaican places usually have goat?  Overall, I think this is a great place for a date night or a quiet dinner with old friends.  The food just wasn't special enough for me to want to drive into downtown.  But if I knew someone who wanted to go here, I wouldn't say no.",

    "text": "Fantastic drinks and cuisine that goes above and beyond whatever \"resort food\" you've had in Jamaica!   My Jerk Pork was fantastic. Sweet and savory with just the right amount of heat. And I really enjoyed the brussels sprouts that accompanied the dish. And I *hate* brussels sprouts. Seriously. I've tried them at some of the fanciest restaurants ever, and I've always despised them. I have no idea what Dwayne's chefs do to make them not only edible, but fantastic!  My wife had the red snapper, which she found a little disconcerting as it was served whole. However, the preparation and spicing were perfect, and any initial trepidation was quickly removed with the first bite. It was served with some sweet-ish bread and a pickled dipping sauce. Outstanding.  We sat at the bar where we were expertly taken care of by a busy bartender. Neither of us are huge rum aficionados, but he found the perfect cocktail (or three) that no only fit our palates, but exquisitely paired with our dishes.  Breadfruit is a small and intimate setting. If you're in a hurry, it's probably not for you. If you're looking for an extensive menu or have food \"issues\" or non-adventurous tastebuds, it's probably not for you. And if you're trying to re-create that one time you went to Jamaica a decade ago, head back to Sandals.   But you can bet that we'll be back. There are still plenty of experiences to be had!",

    "text": "Lets start with the nay sayers that have placed some reviews on here; I am not sure what you saw, read, or thought you would experience here but I am very confused by them. First, the Caribbean is known for a great many spices and throughout history they have traded them, looted for them, and perfected them. So when you say the jerk chicken lit your mouth on fire, I say \"you're welcome!\" Each item we ordered was perfectly seasoned and so well done, if it wasn't for the urban atmosphere I would have said I was eating in Jamaica. We ordered the plantains to start which were amazing. It is hard to perfect a plantain, in my opinion, since they can be bland but these are very tasty. The jerk sauce paired with it was amazing! And that was just the starter. We ordered the prawns and the Caribbean Jerk Salad and the Red Stripe Curried Prawns. Again, how do you make a dish from very humble ingredients taste so good? First, you come here you let the chefs magic happen. The prawns were spicy and full of flavor. The red beans and rice are an awesome compliment. Top notch food...  Now the bar...okay, this is a bar! Not a $9 beer night followed by shots of some swill. This is a bar people! There are mixologists that can place tastes on your palate from very precise mix of rums and flavors up on the shelf. This is not a \"vodka\" bar as one review had so complained. It is a RUM bar and it does just that amazingly. They pull the flavors and complexities of each  rum and pour it into a drink of amazing conceptions that very few bars do anymore. Very well done!  My only negative was that I wished that it was bigger...well...but then I don't...people need to experience this all on their own. Being that it is a smaller footprint you will need a reservation. It did feel cramped  in the corner but it did not detract from the experience for me. Walking up and in might be a challenge but don't let that stop you from going in.",

I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..  We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.  We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish.   For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...  The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!",

After we sat there for about 5 min I asked if we could sit at the bar and got the approval.

I asked if he was always like this and he said \"yeah he is always rude like that\" and apologized.  He felt so bad he gave us his discount and told us to come back another day when that owner turned rude host was not there and explained that atmosphere is more welcoming and laid back. I feel bad for the employees whom work for this place.   All this being said the food was great and our unnamed server was extremely laid back.

The rum drinks were good, but pretty small for the $10+ price tag. Same with the \"small plates\". I expected small, not miniscule. There were 5 of us and we basically ended up paying $3 each for one bite of a plantain with mango salsa. The dinner was ok, but not great and slightly overpriced. The service was kind of awful. The waitress really had a snippy attitude from the beginning and kept making snarky comments whenever we'd ask her questions about the menu or about the bill. They also automatically include a 20% tip with the price of the meal and won't give separate totals. The music was really loud, and it was hard to hear each other. There is no parking available except metered parking, which is super annoying because it's not a busy street. All in all, it wasn't a very pleasant dining experience, and I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "The Breadfruit is a staple restaurant for my girlfriend and I. We're usually in here once a month or so. It's a small, quiet restaurant tucked into downtown. While small, it's nicely decorated with rotating local artists' work displayed on the walls. Service is always very friendly and usually pretty quick.  The entres are all generally pretty first rate. Though I usually get the curried chicken, the brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are both excellent choices. On the vegetarian side of things, the pop cho with ginger is amazing. I love the sweet potato mash with garlic - unfortunately it wasn't on the menu the last time I was there - not sure if it'll be making a return or not.  Personally I like spicy food - so I've never had any issue with it being overly hot. In terms of consistency it's always fresh and excellent - one of the more consistent restaurants in this regard. Most of the entrees are in the $10 range - which I think is very reasonable.  If I was going to nitpick at anything it'd be the appetizers - not the quality which is generally very good (the festivals with the nice mango chutney are usually our pick) - but the pricing. With shrimp and scallop appetizers being more expensive than most the entrees it just seems odd - though I'm sure getting quality, fresh seafood in Phoenix probably isn't cheap.  *EDIT* - Breadfruit now has a liquor license and is no longer BYOB - bummer.  Also, their specials tend to be significantly pricier than most their menu items (like double average entree cost) but they don't go out of their to mention this - so be sure to ask pricing on the specials.",

    "text": "I am totally irie after tonight's dinner at The Breadfruit. What a great little gem in Phoenix. The lady of the house and I went , as I'd been following the place on Yelp, and seeing the great reviews in the local papers.   I'm familiar with Island food, having spent my high school years in Florida during a period of much emigration from Haiti, Jamaica, and the other islands. It was a real pleasure to see the classics presented in a modern setting.   The Breadfruit just got their liquor license! Normally, we don't start with cocktails, but the drinks menu looked amazing. I chose My Favorite Carrot Juice, which is made with carrot juice, coconut milk, vanilla and more. Loved it. The lady had the Sorrel, and later the Pink Ting. She loved it.   We started with their perfect Appleton Rum Sea Scallops and a Spinach Patty. The scallops were cooked just right and were on the money with regard to spice. The spinach patty is such a basic thing, really delicate with some unexpected savory taste.   She had Curried Chicken and Dumpling. Superb. The whole wheat dumpling was unexpected and had a thick bit to it. The go-alongs were cabbage, green banana, and plantains. I got to taste most of it and found it to be  perfect island comfort food.   I had the Estovich Fish and Festival. Tonight's fish was red snapper, which I love. They used their Jerk rub to heat it up and put the Estovich on the side. Good move, as you can heat it up Scotch Bonnet-style, as much as you'd like. This came with grilled pineapple, coleslaw, and one festival. Said corn on the menu, but it never came.   Service was superb. Our server, Jason, asked if it was our first time and where we'd heard of them. When I said \"Yelp\", he quickly jotted this on the order pad. This waiter was great at anticipating our questions and explaining the menu. Goodup guy, as the Jamaicans say!",

I arrived well dressed with a pocket full of money and very hungry around 5pm and was the first customer. It was my first visit and no one told me where to sit or dine, until this RUDE skinny little half-island black man with short twisted dred-locks approached me. I told him it was my first visit and asked him where to sit and he told me\"IF I DO NOT HAVE RESERVATIONS, I WOULD HAVE TO SIT AT THE BAR AND EAT!\" How friggin rude. So I sat at the bar and noticed all of the workers were white or/ Hispanic and can tell they mostly catered to white or/ Yuppie folks trying to get an Island feel. However, I was born in the Caribbean and hate when Other wanna-be island folks like this skinny black idiot at the Breadfruit rum and bar treat their own in disgrace. However the bartender Brian made an excellent drink from my country's Angustora 7 year rum and I wanted another one but was too hungry so I left. I then went to Caribbean Cuisine on the Glendale side of town and though it was in a rougher area, they welcomed me with open arms like True Caribbean people do!",

Not sure what that had to do with my question.  But anyway, the food was tasty but weak, just like the drinks.  Hard for me to take any Jamaican restaurant seriously with no jerk wings on the menu. I mean really?  Overpriced for amount of food you get as well.  Also overrated",

I brought a bottle of champagne to share and it seemed all of my friends brought bottles of liquid treasures themselves! We had so much to drink, that the champagne didn't get opened. With a reasonable corkage fee of 5$ it was easy to bring a ton of wine!   For an appetizer we shared the plantain avocado spring rolls. They were so-so. Nothing overly impressive to me. I was actually wishing for a spicy sauce to dip them in. For my entree I had the Brown Stew Chicken dish. It's a marinated and sauteed chicken dish served with rice with peas and some steamed veggies. Again... no spice with the dish. I actually asked for some hot sauce to go with the dish. Despite the lack of heat, It was still very flavorful and I enjoyed it.   I would like to give Breadfruit another try. I think their simple menu lends for getting a dish just right and making it well! I look forward to trying their other menu items!",

    "text": "Delicious. I'll be back for seconds, and thirds, and fourths...  In quintissential Phoenix style, Breadfruit is housed in an unassuming, small space in a nondescript neighborhood close to the heart of downtown. The space itself needs a little more character and decor to qualify for True \"Phoenix hidden gem\" status at the moment, but it's only the first week of its existence so time will tell.   Still, I was sold at first glance of the menu. Lots of stuff I've never heard of, with descriptions that all tempted the taste buds. I decided to zero in on the brown chicken stew, which is actually not a stew at all but however you want to describe it, it was damn tasty. As a starter my friend and I also split a two-dollar chicken curry patty, which I'd describe as a cross between the crust of an apple-less apple turnover, a samosa, and chicken curry. YUM. I could see myself going back just to eat another one of those alone.   A small complaint, one that I don't often have at American restaurants that are addicted to overstuffing their obese customers, concerns the portion size. I do like, and favor, smaller portions at any restaurant I go to. But the brown chicken stew was just so good that it left me wanting just a *notch* more. Also, beware if you're new to this particular entree as I was, because the chicken contains bones.   The service is alright. The waitstaff struck me more as just... \"a bunch of dudes,\" as opposed to professional waiters/waitresses. But the \"dude\" we had was perfectly friendly.   Another great addition to the downtown scene. I suggest they consider expanding their Friday and Saturday night hours though.",

Your menu sang to me with so many tasty words, and your location couldn't be better.   We finally met last night, and I am disappointed. While you have a very cheery atmosphere and wonderful staff, your food just didn't woo me at all. The fish was overcooked- burned on the ends,even- and left me unsatisfied. The slaw looked promising, but proved to be nearly impossible to eat. (you try picking up long strings of cabbage and bean sprouts. Just see what happens.) And the breadstick? Oy. The taste of it was fantastic, but it was so overdone that I thought for a second that I might have to send you a dentist's bill if I finished it.   My dining companion was enamored with your curry tofu. Sadly, the one bite of his tofu ended up being the highlight of my meal. Sigh.   I wish that things had turned out better, Breadfruit, because I really wanted to like you. But, when visiting you leaves me hungry for the hole in the wall Caribbean place on Camelback and 35th Ave, I know that it just isn't going to work out.   Good luck to you.   PS...did a midget design your bathroom? I had no idea they even made sinks that small.",

I ordered the special, red snapper wrapped in a leaf of some sort.  I saw the couple at the table next to me eating it and their portions looked appropriate.  When I got my meal, I had maybe 2 ounces of fish, a large piece of raw pineapple and some sort of a bread stick.

    "text": "When I was little, I was a very picky eater. I liked what I liked and would throw a fit if I had to eat something on my \"Do not eat\" list.  But something changed as an adult.  Now, I am much more adventurous when it comes to food. (Except for ketchup. I still can't eat that stuff!)  So, when it comes to trying new restaurants and foods, I am more than happy to take a risk. And, that is what led me to Breadfruit.  Yeah, Jamaican food isn't like a culinary feat, and although I love Cuban food (a cousin to Jamaican food, you could say), I'd never ventured to the spicier side of Caribbean cuisine. But, WOW, I'm so glad I did!  It was a lovely Friday afternoon, when a work friend suggested we head over to Breadfruit for a long, leisurely lunch. And, I must say Breadfruit was a great antidote to a stressful work week. After waiting just a little too long for our menus, we were greeted by a friendly waiter who gave us some recommendations on drinks. My friend had the carrot-coconut juice -- he loves his carrot juice, so he was thrilled they had it on the menu and loved every sip of it. I, on the other hand, just had their house iced tea. They had a lot of other beverage options, I just wanted to avoid something too sweet.   There was a decent selection of menu choices and everything sounded delicious, so it was tough for me to decided which meal would whet my appetite.  My friend had the jerk chicken, which he said was spicy (of course) but fantastic. I had the brown stew chicken, and in my best Rachel Zoe, it was BA-na-NAs!  The chicken was cooked wonderfully and the flavorful sauce was so complex and delicious my taste buds sang a glorious \"Hallelujah!\"   I can't wait to go back and try more from their menu.  I was totally eying the plantain avocado spring rolls -- LOVE plantains and LOVE avocados, so I know I would LOVE this!  And, I was really wanting to try the curried chicken dumplings, but I was afraid if I had that for lunch I would be in a food coma for the rest of the day.  You know a place is good, while during your first visit, you are already planning what your next meal will be!  So for that reason alone, I'd say it was another great culinary adventure for me! Yeah!",

    "text": "Breadfruit is the truth.    This is corroborated by the fact that Exhibit A, i.e, the Jerk Chicken will make you a believer in a deity, be it God, Buddha, Allah, Brahman, Akal Purakh, Zeus, or Marley.  The bird is marinated in hot and spicy seasonings and finished to perfection on the grill.  It remained tender and juicy throughout, except for the masterfully charred ends that added a slight smokiness to the entire dish.    But lets back up a second.  The space itself is brilliant in its simplicity.  The walls are lime and slate gray with classy darkwood furniture.  The glassed walls look out onto the stoic skyline of downtown Phoenix and onto the hidden pave of Pierce, an homage to side-street gems that one would find in cities like NY, SF, and Seattle.   It is comfortable and cozy inside, with exposure to the cuisine sharks tending the kitchen.  At all times, there is activity, but just enough so that you feel the life of the kitchen spill out onto the dining area.  I love restaurants that pull this off.  For an app, we started with an order of the Curry Chicken Patty.  It was sensational.  Within the pastry was a harmonious balance of chicken to curry with a noticeable, but slight burn throughout.  Two came in an order, which must be shared with a partner because two pre-meal would fill you up too heavily.  When the grilled jerk chicken was presented, it was glorious because you find the Caribbean influences presented on the dish; a white wine vinegar drizzled slaw, roasted pineapple, and a succulent, savory corncob.  Where the chicken is the heart of the meal, the corn was the soul.  Paired together, I couldn't have been more delighted.  To drink, we had the D&G Spicy Ginger Beer imported from Jamaica.  Erm, I typically like Ginger Beer, but this one was branded as spicy and they f'ing mean it.  Be careful that you are prepared for spice-on-spice if you order it.  Looking back, i probably should have stuck with water, although the Ginger Beer was rudimentary for palate preservation as you meander through all of the various flavors of this cuisine.  Honestly, I cannot wait to go here to grab a Guinness (a Jamaican staple according to Zane Lamprey) or a Red Stripe.  The surging spiciness demands a brew that could handle this oral development.  Overall, I'm very pleased Breadfruit braved the Great Menace that is downtown development.  Here's to them gaining credibility as they continue to master their art (its not perfect yet, but please believe, its in the mail) and invigorate a local following of foodies and tourists alike to sample some mean Caribbean food.",

If you weren't heading in that direction with the specific intention of going to Breadfruit, you'd never know it existed.    It's a tiny place, probably seating 15-20 at the absolute max, so i see how it could get packed with a quick influx of people.  On this particular lunch outing around the noon hour, I was one of five diners.  And still it took nearly 45 minutes to get my food.  So don't expect a quick lunch in between business meetings, this place is too laid back for that.  But the service was tremendously friendly.  I got the jerk chicken and it was very well spiced.  Thankfully not overpowering like I've had elsewhere.  it was a nice, hefty sized chicken breast and was very succulent, not dry at all like others have suggested (perhaps other reviewers aren't familiar with traditional dry-rub jerk).  I do wish there was more chutney though, as it was delicious.  The corn, pineapple, and slaw were all a bit flavorless.  The highlight of the meal by far was the carrot juice, which was like drinking a big slice of frosted carrot cake and offset the spicy jerk chicken nicely.  I'm sure I'll go again at some point to try some of the other items, but I'm not into it as a lunch place even though it's close to where I work.  I can get a quicker and just as filling lunch elsewhere for cheaper.(not that a $14 jerk chicken entree and carrot juice is that expensive. . .)",

She had the Jerk Prawns and plantains for her entree and I had the Brown stew chicken. Both excellent choices. Jerk prawns were very spicy as they should be. Brown stew chicken was mildly spicy as I preferred. Special on rum drinks made from scratch was $6, great deal for a downtown restaurant! I had a Dark and Stormy, ginger soda and Rum, excellent! We shared the ice cream parfait with raisins and cherry tart agar agar for desert. So worth the extra calories! Our server was terrific and very helpful. Good atmosphere, cozy with just the right amount of  mood music. The Rum Bar connected to the restaurant is a nice alternative if you want to skip dinner and enjoy the tasty mixed rum drinks instead!",

The curry tofu is my favorite, however, the pop cho is also tasty. As for beverages, the carrot juice or the coconut water are good, but I am docking them a star as soon I will no longer be able to BYOB here. Hopefully, when they get their liquor license they will have great wines so I can update my post. Everyone must finish their meal with the Breadfruit's own homeade vanilla ice cream and sweet potato pudding. It is melt in your mouth good. If they sold the vanilla ice cream in pints, I would stock it in my freezer, and probably turn into a vanilla ice cream addict. Breadfruit is simply wonderful.",

Had the brown stew chicken and the flavors were just right spicy. Shared the slaw and all of the flavors so complimented each other. The rice was generous and tasty and did not sit heavy at the end of the meal. The ginger sweet potato pudding was wonderful...no heavy sugar taste...just plain comfort food. The entire meal was like sitting down at the table of the chef's family. I will definitely return!",

Then they refused to give any pepper or some chilli to my friend whose food was not spicy enough. Then, when my guests arrived later, they would refuse to put a chair at our table, though are table was big enough to seat two more people there easily. And after all these annoying push backs, they would not split checks and 8 out of us had to do our own math. And the last strike was when the server came and told a friend that she had to sign a $25 tab. Seriously people, you have a restuarant in AZ, don't you know any amount under $50 does not have to be signed in state of AZ.. Bottom line, if this restaurant does not start to accomadate their guests, they will loose customers. I know I will not go back there again, and will not recommend them to any one I know.",

Waiters are friendly, and beverages are fabulous:  try carrot juice or Seasonal Fruit Quencha.  Entree was needless to say superb and veggies were grilled perfectly. (why would I ask a chef to cut  a corn on the cob in half to share when it tasted so good unless I was with a cheap date.  I can buy it for her for only $2 anyway.)  I am not an expert on restaurants but I can wholeheartedly recommend the Breatfruit for anyone who has exotic taste and his/her palate is hot and spicy side.  One thing:  if you are used to eating junk foods including Pita Jungle's, you need not to visit.  Will go back again and again.  A++++++++++++++++++",

Menu emphasizes fresh seafood but I was lucky to be there one of the 2-3 evenings each month when they have their special succulent braised oxtail marinated overnight in Jamaican flavors and cooked slowly for most of the day then served with rice and perfect mix of grilled fresh summer pattypan squash with sauteed eggplant and olives. An outstanding dessert of chocolate cake with center of molten chocolate-rum and side of real whipped cream. Amazing bar with over 100 rums served up lively pomegranate lime mint mojito. Hot ginger mint tea was served as chunks of fresh ginger and mint leaves under hot water in a French press. Tea as it was meant to be. Professional friendly staff, moderate prices, and local artists' works on the walls make this a great evening and great deal.",

    "text": "wow! we finally found this place after 3 mos of salivating and anticipating. well let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. we accidentally stumbled in after riding around on bikes looking for a place with a byob policy. sure am glad the sushi place next door had a not so friendly or inviting bartender, otherwise we would have stayed and missed bread fruit! we were the first to arrive, so we had first choice... which was of course outside! only problem with the outside dining is the chairs with rounded legs on the grass, which was very shaky. other than that, everything else was great. we were riding around on bikes, and this was the first stop, so we went with a plethora of sides... and we were pleasantly surprised at the flavors and intricacies of each simple dish. they looked so simple, but tasted very True to the islands. I've been to jamaica and have to say that i felt sa though i had been secretly flown back there without my knowledge... only thing missin was the ocean. the simplest dishes were the best and most tasty. i mean it doesn't get any simpler than steamed cabage and peppers, but hello tasty coconut after taste. the dumplings were tasty too! i loved the sauce, had to try both, and i devoured them! the coleslaw was my second fav. very simple but filled with tons of flavor! sa the night progressed about 4 table tops showed up, so if i have to guess 7pm is a great time to go and be served fast. yes you can take ur own wine, not sure about beer. since we were biking and didn't want to ride full, i didn't do desert. however next time im trying the pudding! enjoy this hidden treasure, i sure did.",

When we moved from the bar to the restaurant side we were the only customers they had as there were seven of us.  When a friend that lived in the area stopped by the waitress made a huge deal about adding one more person and was rude to both my mother and her friend.  The waitress and staff in general had an attitude that they were better and we should be happy to eat in their establishment.  We are all professionals and were dressed as such after working a full day...The drinks were overpriced and terrible...Chicken was burnt...Portions were small and gross...Everything was overpriced...I would not recommend this place to ANYONE...",

The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and attentive and the kitchen is exposed so you can see your food being prepared. They have traditional Caribbean drinks and fresh squeezed carrot juice with coconut and ginger. The avocado/chicken spring rolls are tasty, but could use a little more spice. For dinner, the chicken dumpling is delicious (well, the chicken is), but the jerk shrimp plate is a bit sparse and overpriced for what you get. Overall, we liked it and we'll be going back again to try some more dishes. This time we'll be sure to BYOB!",

The bok choy/mashed potato dish was delicious (especially the sauce on the bok choy) and the tofu and rice dish had a great sauce too.  The best, however, was the amazing sweet potato pudding with a coconut crust.  Yum!  The spice level was rather low, so even people who don't like spicy food would be fine.  It was a bit expensive--$41 for three people, and we only ordered two dishes to share--but I would definitely go back.",

The server was quick to offer assistance & drink recommendations.  When I ordered my food -- the vegan curry -- I asked for water instead of buying one of their exotic dishes.  After a couple minutes of the water not arriving I started to get annoyed, but then it came out with my lunch which was impressively fast! Fast enough that I completely forgave the slowness of the water.  The food was excellent!  I thoroughly enjoyed every bite and then it got better: a woman (a cook i believe?) came out and explained to me that it was unique type of organic tofu that has to be ordered directly from Jamaica and one serving alone has about 30 grams of protein in it!  She was very friendly and very pleased to hear that I was enjoying my meal - and our short conversation made me enjoy it even more!  Oh - and they allow you to BYOB too!  Just one per person, but that's still pretty awesome in my opinion.",

The decor has this cozy setting and I'm a big fanatic of red brick walls..Was content with the staff and they were courteous. The food was scrumptious! I ordered the rice and peas that was mixed up with coconut milk but however there was a tiny piece of a habanero pepper and my mouth was shooting flames which was unexpected in my dish. Another dish was the Ital soup which is ideal for people who have a cold and a good cleanse after a good workout at the gym. I saved the best for the last - the vanilla ice cream combined with jello,plump raisins, and grape nuts (cereal). Had to savour every bite!! Next time - I will inform them not to put habanero peppers in my rice dish because that was beyond too hot for me but I will be back to try their other dishes!!",

It was the sweet potato bread pudding served at Breadfruit, and knew this was a restaurant we had to try. We went for dinner on a weeknight, and were immediately greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable server. The restaurant is inviting and cozy, lit with candles, and open kitchen, polished concrete floors, a brick wall and bright green accents. The waiter, who was attentive without hovering, recommended an appetizer on special that night, and it was fantastic. It had heat, but it was the flavors that came through. We ordered rice to go with at the server's recommendation, and were glad we did, as it gave something to soak up that leftover sauce. Fantastic. My husband order another special for his entree -- oxtail rice and chard. It was delicious. But the hit of the night was a staple entree, jerk chicken. Again, plenty of heat, but the flavors were doing a reggae in my mouth. We ended our meal with rich coffee made in the French press and the dessert that had lured us there in the first place: Sweet Potato Bread Pudding.  The menu isn't extensive, but what we had was exquisitely prepared, and the specials added variety. It's also vegetarian friendly. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "As many times as ive been to the Breadfruit im surprise I haven't written a review for it yet. This is my favorite restaurant to go to. You can find me and my girlfriend there at least once a month as we both enjoy the place very much. I enjoy the look of the place alot. Its not big and fancy. Hell, you could easily pass right by it and not even notice its there. But that all adds to the charm of The Breadfruit and makes it seem like its a secret place that only you and whoever you are dining with knows about. Its also a romantic place for a date. The paintings on the wall are for sale. It can get a bit loud when it gets filled only because the place is small. But that's a minor gripe. When my girlfriend and I go she gets the brown stew chicken. I get either the curry chicken and dumplings or the jerk chicken, and I don't even like spicy food that much. But the jerk chicken is so good I love it. quote me on what im about to say. THE BREADFRUIT HAS SOME OF THE BEST AND STRONGEST DRINKS! I love their drinks there because they are never watered down. The first sip of your drink may seem pretty overwhelming. But don't worry, its just the alcohol telling your tastebuds to wake the hell up! The drinks are smooth and very tasty and you just taste a hint of alcohol in the drink even though they put alot in them. Which ive always thought was good when the alcohol doesn't overpower the taste of the drink. The Dark & Stormy regular or the Dark & Stormy 151 are my drink of choice, highly recommend either one of those. One more thing. Whatever you order make sure you get a side of festival bread. I don't care if your meal already comes with it, order a side anyway. Its very delicious bread. A dinner for a couple averages between $40-$60 if u just get dinner and a couple drinks. But if you just get dinner and no drinks, then its between $20-$30.",

The menu is limited and its my personal pet peeve for someone to call a green plantain a sweet plantain. I'm a vegan so they have one vegetarian option on the menu which I wasn't interested in so I asked if I could create a plate. They said no because theyre flavors were expertly paired and the dishes were already made. Ha! I wondered is it a TV dinner because if not you should have no trouble putting rice and peas, plantains, and greens on a plate. I asked if a watermelon could be put in my mojito they said no like how hard is that. I looked around to see if the business reflected all the no's i was getting and the place was empty. Mind you it was dinner time and its a dinner restaurant. I finally ordered the avocado plantain spring rolls. The bartender brought me out to menu items that I did not order and tried to convince me that i ordered them The spring rolls could have been good if the plantains were actually sweet. I paid my bill and went over to the Westin restaurant and had a great meal",

As we were told, it is a very quaint place and could lead to wait times to be seated if you go during a busy time. Luckily we beat the crowd and were able to sit right away. The place has a dark, cool ambience, but looks clean and inviting.  I had the Sorrell drink, it was really good, but a bit too strong of a taste for me to go with my dinner. We had the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls for an appetizer. They were good, but a little mushy and not quite as flavorful as I had expected. The Jerk Chicken Off the Grill was delicious. It was one of the most flavorful, juiciest, tender chicken dinners I've had. And the sides of corn, rice, and pineapple were perfect.  Of course I had to try a desert - the Pudd'n A La Mode. Very nice.  All in all, a great local small business to try out and you'll find that you will probably return.",

    "text": "The drinks were great, the food was palatable, but the service was absolutely terrible, and I have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in my life.   I took 7 ladies here for my bachelorette party dinner (we wanted a low-key affair with good food and good drinks, and since I was going to Jamaica for my honeymoon, we figured this was the perfect place). We are all working professional women who are accustomed to fine dining and good service, but unfortunately, we got none of that at The Breadfruit.   Our waitress tried to push the most expensive thing on the menu multiple times, despite my friends saying they don't like seafood. She then tried to push everyone to order sides of rice and peas (I really wonder if they make a commission from selling rice and peas), and also suggested that my friend order some for her 1-year-old son. My friend went ahead and ordered it because she figured he could nibble on it if he wanted, and it wouldn't be a big waste of money if he didn't like it or wasn't hungry. More on this later...  Another friend asked the waitress if she could get her meal without anything banana-related on the plate, because she has a banana aversion. The waitress extremely rudely replied \"The menu SAYS right THERE that no substitutions are allowed. And they AREN'T bananas - they're plantains.\" My friend stated that she couldn't eat either bananas or plantains, and that she wasn't asking for a substitution, but rather the omission of the plantains from the plate. The waitress stated that it could not be done, because it would ruin the presentation of the dish, so I just piped up and told my friend I would take her plantains off the plate.   Now back to the rice and peas. When the 1-year-old started eating it, he spilled some of it onto the table, and then wiped what he had spilled from the table onto the floor (he's a 1-year-old, after all! He hadn't made a peep the entire time we were there, nor did he ever try to get down from his adult-sized chair, so pushing some rice onto the floor was not a huge transgression). The waitress immediately came over and said, in the rudest voice ever, \"Oh that's just GREAT. Can you just NOT let him do that???\" to which my friend replied, \"Don't you have a broom? I will clean it up.\" The waitress just rolled her eyes and disappeared (but never did bring a broom). My friends and I are generous tippers, and would have rewarded the waitress greatly for dealing with the aftermath of a toddler's dinner. However, after the rudeness we had experienced up to this point, we couldn't take it any longer. We asked the other waiter to speak to a manager, and after about 5 minutes (during which time our waitress never did reappear), the manager finally came over and spoke to us. He told us that the waiter would be serving us for the rest of our dinner, instead of the waitress, but he never did apologize for his employee's rude behavior.   I see from other Yelp reviews that others have had similar experiences with that waitress, and I question if she is still employed solely based on her scallop- and rice-and-pea- upselling abilities. It was clear she wanted to do as little work as possible and clear our table as quickly as possible.   If I had only gone for drinks, I would definitely go back again, but I don't think the food is good enough for me to want to tolerate the utterly crappy service, and I know can get good drinks so many other places. Sorry Breadfruit, but I will be getting my Jamaican-food fix elsewhere from now on!",

Not an Applebee's or some drunk \"woo girl\" Scottsdale bar. It sounded like the person  who went before us was looking for the waiting service to come out and sing happy birthday.   I've been hard pressed to find anywhere else in Arizona with this combination of concept and execution. The wait staff was informative and insightful. The food is ALWAYS fresh and the menu is constantly evolving. I HIGHLY recommend the seared scallop appetizer to start the night. You won't regret it! The classic, Jerk Chicken Off the Bone is everything you're looking for in a Jamaican dish. The fresh cabbage slaw that accompanies the chicken provided the citrusy contrast that you need to elevate the spiciness of the dish. They coconut curry tofu is packed with island flavor and is great for the vegetarians out there. And for desert, get the sweet potato pie!",

I recommend trying a few of their 150 varieties of rum or a cocktail such as the Mojito Jamaica or Jamaican Mule. The drinks can be pricey, however, at this place, you finally get what you pay for.  Try the For de Cana 18yr for a rum with the finish and nose you'd expect from a cognac.",

He left work, picked up his 5 year old and met his wife and us,  his out of town guests at the restaurant.  We were wondering if they would have food for the 5 year old who has some food allergies and would have understood if they did not.  What we did not understand was the treatment we got when we inquired. We were told the Chef does not adjust any recipes.  Okay fine.  But we weren't prepared when the help was joined by what appeared to be owner and/or manager who proceeded to say they are an \"adult restaurant\" and they seldom get kids in the restaurant in a very condescending manner.  I was shocked at the tone and could not believe it.  What about service?  What about a nice welcome, wish we could accommodate you but.  We were a party of 4 adults.  The Dad was willing to take his 5 year old and feed him elsewhere but the cold and callous way we were treated make that place not worthy of one star.  Just my opinion. Definitely don't take kids to their \"adult\" restaurant and don't ask for any deviation from the cooking of the menu.  Per the help,  the Chef will NOT make changes to his menu.",

    "text": "Hmmm....where do I start...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!   Honestly, if you don't mind paying through the ear for a mediocre meal, then feel free and pay a visit, but don't say yelp reviewers didn't give you fair warning.   So I was taken here for my birthday, and I was super excited! I had heard good reviews and could not wait to get my hands on some stew chicken!!   We started out with the drink menu, the mango drink with mint is very good and reasonably priced compared to everything on the menu.   Since we heard the portions were small, we decided we would each get an app, share, and then each order entrees.   The Festival with mango chutney...taste was good, price was ridiculous!!!!!! They seriously make 2 tiny breadsticks, cut them in half and stick it in a small bowl of chutney. I don't care what fancy ingredients you use, but for $5.95, at least add some more breadsticks!!!   The plantain and avocado rolls were also small, the plantain was not even fully ripened, and the cost was $7.95..., these ingredients are not fancy, or expensive, and the flavor was disappointing.   I decided that I was going to get the the jamaican patty with fish, but after being slightly confused by the waitress I ended up ordering the chefs special appetizer...OMG what a MISTAKE!!!   The chef's special was fish springrolls with mango and spinach(or some other green) served with a spicy sauce...the flavor was bitter and it needed more fish...especially when I saw the price after the bill came..12.50!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for the smallest spring rolls in the world, and the fish in it? Probably the scraps left over after they get the filets off the bone for an entree.   The stew chicken that I was soo excited about? ehhh...i've made better with a half ass recipe.   The only thing I found that was rare and delicious, was a boiled green banana that is hard to find in phoenix. Although a roasted sweet potato or yam would have fit in as well.   The curry chicken and dumpling is a joke! you get about 4- 5 small pieces of a cut chicken breast and a big dense dumpling, I was afraid to take too much when I asked if i could taste, so i took a sliver or chicken and a sliver of dumpling....not impressed.   The rice and plantain on the plate was ok, but again, the plantain was not fully ripened.   The best thing on my plate was grilled piece of cabbage and the boiled banana.   Now that I think of it, for a restaurant that is is focused on local ingredients and the experience of eating your food etc...why the heck would they serve mangoes, plantains, and green bananas and anything with fish for that matter...seems at odds with the philosophy   All in all, 3 diners, 0 repeat customers.   The space is nice, the service is friendly.   Food is ok, prices are ridiculous.  I would not recommend it to my friends.",

We were told to wait as well, even though as you look around, the restaurant and front patio were 80% empty. We were told we could not sit on the empty front patio since it is reserved for dining guests only. That is fine but again, after we left we still saw a bunch of empty tables on the front patio. We saw the 2 person party finally get seated on the empty table after about 15 minutes. Same deal with us, as we were escorted on the tiny, completely empty, back patio lounge chairs. Our waiter was very good and was a relief to see good service after dealing with the pretentious host. When we asked about ordering appetizers now, we were told we were not allowed to eat on the back patio even though it was completely empty besides us. Too many rules, not customer friendly, almost feels like they are trying too hard to give the feel of an actual busy, highly sought after restaurant. Owners should reconsider the incompetent host and all of his silly games.",

Price bang for the buck ratio not so much  We had the fish rolls $10-12(today's catch spinach with a sauce I would have thought was jerk waitress said it wasn't and pickled mango.   We also ordered plantains $5and the jerk chicken dish.12-14. Everything was fresh and tasy. Portions are  much smaller than I would have expected. The plantains I think were five pieces totally. minimal seasoning and was expecting it to be more crispy.   Fish roll dipping sauce/ paste was so good. I asked for some more to have with my chicken. Waitress said no!!!. I was a little pissed. They say they make everything fresh and in small batches and she brought be out some mixture of onions peppercorns and habanero in vinegar!. wtf?   Grilled Jerk chicken was great small breast piece fresh seasoning similar to paste but more spicy grilled pineapple jicama and a corn n the cob.  Dessert with the local ice cream and sweet potatoe cake thing was also tasty.  I just glanced at Aileen B's review she ordered same stuff and said the same thing Maybe owners will read these consider some changes. Chicken breast can be had for 2-3 bucks a pound so a larger piece wouldnt kill them and the bananna cookin it a little more would make sense. Maybe add some kind of rub or spice. Desert was great as well We ordered mojito and I think the hurricane also tasy felt like Scottsdale prices but under 10 dollars for decent drinks. I wasnt impressed with the mojito like azcentral was that rated it best in phx. Next time maybe spend more time in rum bar next door and eat elsewhere to fill me up.",

We decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation, but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders.  Tony and Beth were so nice and efficient.  Tony just moved from Portland in  November, so we had a nice conversation with him about the area (we spend summers in OR). I had a mojito, wow, the best mojito I have had in the Valley, probably ever.  My hubby had the Caipirinha.  It was so good.  We thought we would have one appetizer and leave.  So we ordered the Scallops, then the Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls.  They were so delicious.  The scallops were spicy, it was like fireworks in my mouth, in a good way.  I loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls.  My hubby wanted the soup of the day, the pumpkin and sweet potato soup.  I ended up eating most of it.  Since I was DD, the hubby had another drink, this time the Kingston Rum Punch, wow, that was strong but tasty.  Tony recommended the Rum Glazed Prawns and Roti Flatbread, double wow.  My hubby had a Pina Colada to wash that down. That was the best PC I've had.  Not the blended coco lopez type.   For dessert we had their bread pudding.  This was the only thing I was not that crazy about, don't get me wrong, I still ate it.  I am just used to the New Orleans type of Bread pudding, more gooey.  The experience at  Rum Bar was so great we can't wait to come back and bring friends.",

In our case, we were given the impression that we'd have to wait about 20 minutes for our little group.  On the phone they did tell us that there was another party ahead of us.  What they didn't tell us was that it would really be more like the 20 minutes times 3 for the four adults and two kiddos.  When we made our way in, the place was half full, but four two-tops were open and a large table for six was reserved.  Not for us, of course, and nobody was leaving anytime soon.  While we waited, a party of two walked in and was seated.  A few minutes later, another two-top near them turned over.  A little forward thinking would have been to seat the two at one of the other open tables, and put the other now free tables together.   It would have been a tight fit, but it could have worked.  Needless to say, The Breadfruit is small.  There is no waiting area and with the kiddos we weren't going to wait outside in the drizzle.  We waited in a hallway that lead to the bathroom until we couldn't wait anymore.  In the end we walked out.  One star for the cute ambiance but for nothing else.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went last night and had a very good time. We started with the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls which we both enjoyed.  She had the Curried Chicken and Dumpling and thought it was good but not great. The dumpling was very dense, a point that seemed a little odd, but the flavor was very good.  I had the Jerk Chicken off the Grill and thought it was fantastic; the spice was considerable but delicious. The other items on the plate complimented the chicken well.  We thought the portions were just right, and I feel the price of the Jerk Chicken off the Grill dish to be very reasonable considering the quality.  For drinks, she had the Rum Cider, another item she thought was good but not great. I had The Good Jake, which I thought was very good and packed a serious punch of ginger. I also had a Dark and Stormy, an enjoyable staple drink.  The dessert menu underwhelmed us (mostly because I wasn't in the mood for ice cream), so we skipped that course.  There was one very slight issue with a lack of attention when we sat down. After thoroughly examining the menu and choosing our drinks, our appetizer, and our entrees, we had still not even seen a waiter or even received glasses of water. I'm not an impatient person, so I think I was justified in feeling we had been overlooked. The first person I did see must've been the owner. I kind of assumed he was not our waiter, but I asked him if he was anyway. He apologized for our wait, took our drink and appetizer order just as our waiter showed up. As he relayed the order to the waiter, he stated that the first round of drinks was on the house. I thought that was a very nice gesture that made up for any mistake on their part. Based on what I saw of the service at other tables, I think this was simply a one-off mistake by our waiter and don't expect it would happen on a second visit.  Other than that, the service was very pleasant and attentive. The owner delivered our food and gave us some tips on how to best enjoy the dishes we had ordered. Water was refilled often. I was offered another drink as soon as my current drink was empty. All very good service points.  If I could give this place a 4.5/5, I would. The only mild detractions due to my girlfriend only considering her entree and drink to be good rather than great and the minor attentiveness issue when we were first seated.  We will definitely be back to The Breadfruit.",

We tried the run lunch (changes daily), fin & co, and a rum old fashion. All were amazing! Well balanced and smooth.  Food: we shared a pepper shrimp appetizer which had some heat but was really delicious and he shrimp were cooked perfectly. I got the red stripe curried prawns and my friend got the jerked chicken. Both were delicious as were the sides but I have to say the curried prawns were surprisingly great. The curry definitely tasted of red stripe but the mix of spices paired so well and I want to go back to Phoenix just for this! I sent several other friends to Breadfruit for dinner and they were equally impressed and raved about the food and drinks.  The service, atmosphere, cleanliness, and restrains were all great too. Our food came out hot, drinks were promptly delivered. It's a bit snug in the restaurant but that's really the only thing that isn't glowing that I have to say about it and to be honest I didn't even notice it that much because I was so impressed with the food and drinks. Highly recommend!",

Our smoked marlin appetizer was a great start, tho the amount of toasted bread could have been increased (it could have been, if we paid extra?).

    "text": "My friends and I went to Breadfruit and Rum Bar on Friday night.  I was the last one to show up, but from what I was told, was the host wouldn't sit us because everyone wasn't present.  He even offered to sit them at a table sef for 4, but my friends said no cause I was coming.  When I arrived, he took us on the patio and sat us at a table for 6, which confused us because the table had been empty before my arrival.  After they told me about their experience with the host, I told them I had checked out previous reviews and seen a couple stating the host is rude.  We joked that hosts must come up with various ways to continue putting off customers for the sake of continuing the rude reputation.  Our waiter was nice, but didn't seem to enthusiastic (probably a long night).  All of us were having a good time and taking most everything with a grain of salt, but he just wouldn't perk up any.  He did bring us these tasty little mint leaves gelatin thing (I forgot what it was called) to cleanse our palate for the meal.  It was quite nice and refreshing. Our food was pretty good.  I ordered the tofu along with my friend.  She said hers was cold, but mine was warm.  Others got salad and chicken and enjoyed their meals, nothing that stands out too much.  I take that back, there was a slice of bell pepper, perfectly cooked...that little bit was simply amazing!  The ginger beer and Sorrel were both delicious.  If you decide to go, I definitely recommend both drinks. However if you do go, order your drinks early.  It took 10 minutes each for a bottle of red stripe and a pina colada. I gave this place two stars, because other than the drinks (when we got them) and bell pepper slice, nothing else was memorable.  Maybe I'll try it again eventually and see if we went on an off day.",

You can choose between sitting on the small patio or inside. A balance between quiet experience yet still fun and lively. 2. The drinks- Beats the Blues was a colossal success, balancing the earthiness of beat juice, spiciness of cinnamon and other spices and of course the rum. All the drinks are rum-based (and fabulous actually) including the punch of the day. 3. The food- caribbean, so lots of jerk and seafood-yet there are also vegetarian options.  4. The service- absolutely incredible. Every waitress/waiter I've had have always been so accommodating.  I look forward to the next time I get to go to Phoenix and eat here again!",

They were slightly spicy, yet provided a delicate flavor. The jerk chicken salad was a little hot for my taste and lacked a little salt. With that being said, I loved the fresh fruit in the salad. I am a vodka drinker, but was eager to try their rum drinks... I am sure glad that I did! Our bartender was extremely knowledgable about the restaurant, their culture, and picked what is now my favorite cocktail: The Shim Sham. I absolutely recommend this place, just bring your wallet as the drinks are $9+ and the food is greater than $10.00. Know what spices your palate can handle.",

After being greeted by an elegant gentleman I immediately noticed the cool red stripe pendant lights hanging over the bar (ripe with a fine selection of rums and other libation offerings). After finding this place on OpenTable for a New Years Eve dinner, again I wasn't anticipating or even necessarily wanting a \"five star experience\" but I'm pleased to say that's what we had. However the only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because I was a bit taken aback by the fact that their pre fixe menu wasn't advertised properly before I made the reservation, so we spent a great deal more than we anticipated to on one meal. Despite that, my beau and I enjoyed one of each from the options, and also opted-in for the cocktail pairings. Sure enough everything was absolutely amazing and my favorite dishes will probably the soup and the swordfish. I look forward to visiting this place on an average night and I'm grateful for the great service and delicious dishes.",

I'm sorry but when you are paying $12 per cocktail and $27 for a piece of salmon, I think bread should be free......right Olive Garden?  Our bill came to $300, and I left still hungry.

The sides the prawns were served with were good as well (coleslaw, grilled corn, breadstick).  The beverages they offer here are wonderful as well.  While I was initially wary of getting carrot juice, the carrot juice they offer here is slightly sweet (from the addition of raw sugar), creamy, and the nutmeg they added gave it a very nice flavor.  The Pink Ting grapefruit soda is also quite tasty, as well as the refreshing apple cider (locally produced).    During our meal the waiters strongly suggested that we order the beans and rice with the jerk entrees.  I tasted some of the rice and beans from my husband's entree (brown stew chicken), which tasted OK, nothing special.  If it is so strongly suggested to add the beans and rice to the entree, why isn't it included automatically in the entree then?  Minus some points for naming your restaurant breadfruit, but not having breadfruit on the menu!  It's like calling your restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken but not offering any chicken. : p",

Our group of 7 was very diverse and we found the gentleman, who showed us to our seats, to be very judgemental.  He accused one of us of smelling \"funny\" and almost did not let us in despite a reservation! We were allowed in and were seated in the back cigar lounge. My wife and I visit a local Phoenix restaurant every weekend and never have we experienced this kind of treatment. Finally, our seating location in the back also seemed to be the main travel path for the staff taking out trash and bringing in ingredients.  We felt like we were in their way as we socialized, interrupted several times with rude \"Excuse me's\".   We won't be going back simply due to judgemental and rude staff.",

When I asked if I could have white rice instead of rice and peas, I was told the chef didn't alter the menu. What I ended up ordering was the nastiest thing ever. Some weird shredded beef.  The plaintains weren't even cooked all the way and were a bit raw.   My husband's food was just as bad. We were so pissed that we wasted $50 when we could've gone to a real authentic jamaican restaurant! Only reason I'm giving it a 2 star is because our server was great.  Never again!",

Danielle (chef) is on the forefront of seafood sustainability and a James Beard fellow. Dwayne (rum sommelier  is thee most knowledgeable person for rum in Phoenix. (Challenge me otherwise!)   It can be pricey ( I attribute this to Phoenicians being very spoiled when it comes to price points..myself included..we are a growing foodie scene and that's the price of admission..pun intended.)   This is great place to take someone special...or someone you want end things and not have a scene..(just kidding but you know what I'm saying)   Do yourself a favor and put this on your map",

    "text": "If foodies are snobs, then call me a snob. After my meal at The Breadfruit and Rum Bar, you can also call me a deliriously satisfied snob.   When looking for a new restaurant, I have a few primary criteria: I want a place that prepares foods I don't, can't or won't cook myself. And I want food prepared by people who love to cook, and love to create a great dining experience. TB&RB met those criteria.  It was our 3rd date, and she loves great food perhaps even more than I do. So the bar for our mutual satisfaction was set pretty high. TB&RB cleared that bar with ease.   We started with cocktails. She told our waiter Isaac that she was a Cosmo girl, so he suggested the \"Tamarind Ball II.\" Hers came with a candied tamarind that Isaac told her to nibble between sips. The smile on her face told me all I needed to know. She told me that she'd drink a gallon of it if it was available.  I'm a whisky guy myself, and this is a rum place. (Not a drop of whisky in the whole joint.) So at Isaac's recommendation, I had the \"Punch Bowl Special,\" which is basically whatever the bartender is making that day. My drink was superb. A complex mix of flavors, all nicely balanced with a beautiful finish. Even though rum was the main spirit, it wasn't sweet. I would happily have it again. (And again. And again.)  For appetizers we chose the \"Appleton Rum Sea Scallops\" and the \"Pepper Shrimp.\" The scallops were perfectly prepared. Grilled and crisp on the edges yet soft and buttery on the inside. Seasoned well, flavorful and spicy without being too much.  The Pepper Shrimp was excellent. The spices in the sauce were seriously hot, (which I like - a lot!), yet well balanced as well.   Deserving of special mention were the \"fried greens\" that came with the shrimp. Look, \"greens\" are generic and boring, right? How could they be worth mentioning? These were amazing. Delicate leaves of - what? baby spinach maybe? - crisp-fried, delicate and liberally savory. Pairing these feathery greens with the spicy shrimp took an already excellent dish to a whole 'nother level of awesomeness.   For entree's, she ordered the \"Jerk Pork and Polenta\", I took the \"Curried Goat.\" Entree's called for new drinks so she ordered the \"Kingston 5\" and I had the \"Johnny Appleseed.\"   As that first sip of Kingston 5 slipped past her lips, sheer pleasure washed across her face. She didn't have to say a thing. (As I man, I live to see that look on the face of a woman.) She asked Isaac for a gallon of that as well. (Joking, people. You don't get to take gallon jars of booze home with you. Or do you? Hmmm...)  My Johnny Appleseed was very good as well, (though it didn't quite give me mouth orgasms.) Remember, I like whisky. I don't even drink bourbon because I find it too sweet. Yet these drinks were all outstanding examples of the mixologist's craft and skill. I would happily order any of them again.  She loved the polenta and the pork was exactly as hoped for - tender, flavorful, spicy and balanced seasoning.   The flavor of the curry was very good, but I was a bit disappointed. Not because the dish wasn't good, but because it was \"merely\" good. Up to that point, everything else had been spectacularly good. The goat was more \"meh\" by comparison.   Isaac wouldn't accept \"meh\" and insisted I try something else. He suggested the Steamed Clams instead. He soon returned with a huge bowlful of beautiful clams swimming in a spicy, jerk-based sauce. They were perfectly cooked, tender without veering over into \"chewy,\" and still residing in that spice/salt/heat neighborhood so characteristic of jerk flavors.   We finished the evening by sharing a mug of hot buttered rum. Somehow, I had made it to this point in my life without ever drinking real hot buttered rum.   Let me make one thing very clear: my life will forever be divided into two parts: the dull, gray, boring part prior to my first sip of hot buttered rum, and the beautiful, shiny technicolor part after that moment. It was that good.  The combination of rich buttery flavors, warm rum and silky texture in that drink - topped by a veritable mountain of freshly whipped cream... Well, it was the absolutely perfect ending to a nearly perfect meal. I would die a happy man if my last meal was a mug of that hot buttered rum.  We enjoyed almost 2 hours in culinary bliss, and it was worth every moment and every penny. Do yourself and someone special a favor. Go. Enjoy. Return.

I love authentic Caribbean dishes and I was presented with a lack of flavor barely mature plantains.  The drinks are very similar to other places, nothing out of the ordinary. It was a True disappointment.  I believe the flavors and seasonings had to be adjusted to our population here in the states. Great service!",

I came here both nights that I was in Phoenix and I wish I was in town longer just to come to this place a third time. All the drinks I tried were phenomenal.   I have a tendency to always order drinks that sound good but end up being terrible to the point where I always have to drink the other person's drink. However, everything here was so good, no matter what I ordered, it was delicious. I don't think a bad cocktail exists here.   Cocktails are priced at $10-11 and personally I thought that was extremely cheap because I'm used to paying $15 for something of this caliber. So naturally, I had to order as many different cocktails as I could and I loved every single one of them.  In addition to drinks, I also had the rum cake ($9) and that was really good. The flavors were really pronounced and the tanginess of the orange really permeated through the rum cake. I don't like ginger so I had to take off the ginger on top but I can see why it was there.   Parking: Hard to find free parking on weekends but you can park in the parking lot right behind the restaurant if you don't plan to stay for too long. I was told you're not likely to get towed and luckily I wasn't even though I was there for several hours as I bar hopped.",

Let me say I have been twice now and sat at the bar both visits. The first evening we heavy relied on the Bartenders for recommendations and they did an excellent job helping us out.  The daily secret rum punch is a MUST! (Make sure to Uber,Lyft take the bus or walk) these sneaky drinks can hit you fast!  We ordered roasted plantain with mango dip it was quite tasty, next up was the jerk chicken it was good not mind blowing but we finished it and felt very happy.  Second visit we picked up our NYC cousin from the airport it was late but he needed a snack after that flight.  We ordered jerk pork with polenta and we clearly liked the roasted plantain enough to order again. I will say i did like the jerk pork better than the chicken the chicken was a little over cooked.   All in all I gave it a 5 because the ambiance sitting at bar is excellent and very educational talking to bartenders sometimes it's just about the company and drinks and yes good food... doesn't have to be mind blowing but good food.   We will be back and maybe sit at a table maybe.....  Ps excellent Rum selection!!!",

Service was excellent, our gal was great... No complaints there.  Between my husband and my dishes and the two appetizers and 2 desserts, nothing really was AHmazing. I also didn't hear any comment of \"wow\" from our friends from their dishes.  Appetizer: Sea Scallop and the Ceviche. For a party of 4, you should definitely increase the portion, this was equivalent to 1.5bites per person of the ceviche and the scallops were 2.. for 4 people.  come one... snobbery. Scallops were flavorful but ceviche was ok. Disappointing.  Entrees: Salmon dish and pork & polenta dish. My salmon was tasty but not memorable.  My husband had the same comment about his pork & polenta dish: nothing to talk about.  Cocktails: Gin & Co, Bootleg Smitty.  My husband did not like his Gin & co drink.  I tried it myself and it was not tasty.  My friend's bootleg smitty was delicious, though... I think really the only thing that stood out the entire night: one great cocktail.  Dessert: they only offer two (really neither sounded appealing to me but I wanted some kind of uplifting meal to end the disappointing apps and dinner). Carrot cake: ugh, no. The only thing I enjoyed on there were the fried carrots.. everything else was a blur.  The sweet pot pie. No way.... I didn't find any flavor or anything about it that said 'dessert'.  I've never ordered dessert anywhere and not taken several bites - it's dessert, how do you go wrong?  Writing all this I feel like I literally flushed way too much money down the drain.  I know downtown dining is more expensive, and I'm ok with that, but to not be wowed or even impressed with your meal is borderline insulting.  Like they're telling you you're paying for the privilege to eat here... no thanks.",

    "text": "A group of us dined at The Breadfruit during a conference.  If there were a plethora of choices downtown, we may not have tried it but we are glad we did!  We had no problem getting a table relatively late on a Tuesday night.  The restaurant is not particularly large for dining indoors and the outdoor space was closed.  There is a small and cozy bar area.  The menu is varied with some traditional Jamaican/Caribbean dishes like jerk spiced chicken, fish cooked in a banana leaf and curried goat.  We were pleased to also find two creative vegetarian dishes.  The preparation is upscale - this is not your hole-in-the-wall kind of place.  The cocktails are limited to rum drinks (including some classics made with rum) and a couple of beers.  The service was attentive and friendly.  If I were in the area again on business, I'd definitely check out Breadfruit again.",

I kind of think the cigar lounge should just be removed since it's hard to get already and the space could be used for more restaurant customers. This is coming from someone who likes cigars and cigar lounges. But when I think of a cigar lounge, it's got to be accessible and stress free. I wouldn't go out of my way for the cigar lounge here because it's always full.",

Luckily, we had brought our own beer, so we were able to crack one open while sitting in the grass waiting for a table. Eventually we were seated out front, so we had an excellent spot for people watching.  We started out with the plantain avocado spring rolls. They were golden-crispy and delicious. The Chutney really made them--without they would have been pretty bland.  For dinner I got the curried tofu, and my gentleman friend ordered the brown chicken stew. This was not his first choice, but they were out of the other two entrees he had in mind. We also went through a confusing few rounds of we're out of this, nope, we have it, no, actually...with our server on my tofu. Luckily everything that came out of the kitchen was fabulous. The tofu had a great consistency, nice and chewy, and the coconut rice and beans were rich and filling. The brown chicken stew was also good (says my man).  Overall: great atmosphere, great food, a little hit or miss with menu options (it was a busy night). I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "This review is a four for the classic mojitos and a one for the service. It is a damn shame because those are the best mojitos I have had in Phoenix but the service is so damn shitty. Don't get me wrong, the bartenders are nice but damn, do they all need to act like a bunch of potheads? I first came here for their Grand Opening and after things had died down, waited at the bar for 10 minutes before waving them down for a drink. They kept walking past me (looking down the whole time) and then would crowd around the computer trying to figure out the tickets. Very unorganized. My friends and I ended up leaving because of how long it would take to get a drink with 3 bartenders. I gave it another chance last night and the service was the same. It had been a good 10-15 minutes before the bartender asked if we wanted another mojito. My husband was pissed because he wanted to order food and they never checked up on that after giving us a menu. As we were sitting at the bar, a guy walks up and tells the bartender, \"Um, we need menus for our 9 top over there in the corner.\" He seemed very irritated. The girl hands him menus and walks over to the bartender with the blond dreads and says something about him forgetting about the table. I can't say I was surprised AT ALL. The same male bartender forgot my first drink when I came to the grand opening. My husband and I really want to have dinner in the restaurant but are afraid the inattentive service extends to the servers. The menu looks delicious so maybe we'll have to do take-out.",

Spicy so \"Watch your mouth!\"   Escovitch Fish can't be beat for a downtown fish dish. Its runner up for best sleeper dish on the menu.  And....the award for best sleeper of the menu.....  Brown stew chicken! Come get some! It is a fantastic \"total\" dish. Expect to see an empty plate when you are done. The entire dish is delightful.

    "text": "I had a friend, another Jamaican, with a couple of hours layover in Phoenix so I picked him up and headed to this restaurant as it seemed the closest to the airport. The staff was very friendly and we didn't have to wait too long for service. I have to admit this small establishment was just about on of the fanciest  of the Jamaican restaurants I have visited in north america. This doesn't usually bode well with me because, from my personal experience, the fancier the restaurant, the more they stray from the authenticity of the cuisine by trying to please the american palate. We eschewed the nouvelle cuisine menu items obvious there to please that crowd and  ordered the Escovitch Fish and Jerk Chicken since my favourite \"ox-tail\" was nowhere on the menu and that is the dish most jamaicans use to test the excellence of our restaurants. I guess it doesn't ring well in a fancy place. Anyway, as a Kingstonian, I am used to going to a beach area where they cook up the best escovitch fish, corned with country pepper (habanero) and onions and dripping with grease but just finger licking good. That was not the case here but it was a darn righ better that I could have whipped up in my kitchen at home. I think most americans will probably enjoy it but I will wait until I am back home or at a greasy spoon in Brooklyn or one of the many Florida cities with large jamaican communities. The jerk chicken was also nothing like you would get back home but exotic enough for vacationers to the island needing a bit of nostalgia. The rice and peas was missing something. I am not sure what exactly but suspect it didn't have any coconut milk or not enough. Anyway, I have other jamaican friends who have enjoyed other dishes here so I have not given up yet and plan to return and sample a few other dishes. I have been craving breadfruit, roast or friend so I hope I wont be disappointed.",

    "text": "Bleh.  I'm sorry Breadfruit, but I will not be back.  I was really excited to try this place when we heard it was opening.  I've said before that I don't like Mexican spicy but I do like Asian spicy.  I forgot to add that I also like Caribbean spicy.  Finally, a place in downtown to get some good Caribbean/Jamaican food.  Boy was I wrong.  We met a couple friends here and when we walked in, I loved the decor.  It looks just like the inside of my house with the bright colored walls and the exposed brick and ductwork.  Unfortunately, my love for this place stops there.  We decided to order the Plaintain Avocado Spring rolls.  Taste wise, these were okay on the first bite, the more you ate, the less distinguishable the flavors got.  It was really just a big mess of mush inside a soggy wonton type wrapper.  The dipping sauce was tasty though.  I ordered the Jerk Shrimp and it came with a side of rice and beans.  The tails were removed from the shrimp, which was really nice to not have to take care of myself.  Unfortunately the shrimp were not cooked very well.  They were quite tough and had this weird crispiness to them.  The flavor on the shrimp was ridiculously overpowering.  I know I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to heat and spice, but this was too much.  I couldn't taste anything besides the spice, even after downing my entire bottle of pineapple soda, which was way too sugary.  Everyone else's food looked decent, but overcooked.  One dish, the stew, looked like baby diarrhea.  Honestly.  The highlight of the meal was the little breadstick thing they serve alongside the food.  It was pretty good.  Sorry Breadfruit, I will continue to pass by you in favor of better restaurants like the Turf.",

    "text": "The Breadfruit and Rumbar has been serving downtown Phoenix patrons tasty Jamaican food since 2008, but I finally checked it out for the first time this past weekend. I fell in love with it instantly and can't wait to go back.  The Breadfruit and Rumbar is a charming Jamaican eatery with an extensive selection of more than 100 rums. I had one of my new favorite cocktails there, the changing-daily Punch Bowl Special ($9), made with fresh pomegranate and cranberry juices. It was so refreshing, plus pretty strong, and I could have sipped them all night long. And if you're into cigars, you can purchase one there to pair with your rum, too.  We started with the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls ($8.50), paired with a mango chutney. If you like the avocado rolls at Kona Grill, you'll definitely like these. And it's nice to know The Breadfruit locally sources all their menu items, so everything is extremely fresh.  I'm usually not a huge tofu fan, but I took the recommendation of our server to order the Coconut Curry Tofu ($11.50). It was a really hearty, delicious dish, and the tofu reminded me of chicken bits -- I really liked it. The rice and beans (they're called \"peas\" on the menu) was my favorite part of the dish, which also came with veggies and plantains. It was a great variety of foods and really filling. I'd highly recommend it.  My boyfriend got the Jerk Chicken ($12), which he said was the best jerk chicken he'd ever had.  Besides the tasty food, the atmosphere at The Breadfruit was so pretty. The lounge area was dark and sophisticated -- you won't find any sports televisions -- and the main dining room was small and cozy. Service was excellent, and I'd recommend it as a great date place.",

    "text": "One of our cousins was in town visiting, so we decided to bring her to The Breadfruit and Rum Bar for cocktails and dinner.  This place exceeded our expectations.  The food is absolutely delicious.  This isn't a hole-in-the-wall type of ethnic places (although I do love those); this is a classy joint with fancy gorgeously-plated dinner items.  Portions are a little small, but the taste more than makes up for that.  I had the Brown Stew Chicken, which is less of a stew and more of melt-in-your-mouth chicken in brown sauce.  I also sampled the Jerk Chicken (great spices) and the Coconut Mackerel Rundown (like a tunafish on a chewy wonton - I've never tasted anything like it before, but it was delicious as weird as it sounds).  The cocktails were so well-crafted, with really subtle flavors that paired well with our meals.  The daily rum special (in a large punch bowl out front) was a guava-inspired drink so I was in heaven.  I also sampled the Mr. Smith (very strong and with great flavors again), the Shim Sham (light and fruity) and the Bourbon Masquerade (very aptly named- it tasted so much like bourbon).  The creativity and flavor of the cocktails were fantastic, and the place has a literal wall of rum to choose from when designing their drinks.  The prices are a little expensive, but it's definitely worth it for a special night.  The only thing holding me back from giving 5/5 stars was the service.  Our waitress was a little pushy, appearing visibly upset when we didn't order a \"small plate\" appetizer to go with our entrees and drinks, and she came off as cold and somewhat snobby overall.  Still, probably only one person, and maybe she was just having a bad night.  Overall, check this place out!  Great way to experience Jamaican food.",

Despite not having reservations as this was a last minute occasion, the manager (owner?) squeezed us in and I thoroughly appreciate it.  He definitely made us feel like valued guests.    Our server, Christian, was absolutely lovely.  She kept our drinks filled and put up with our juvenile antics all night long.  Give this girl a raise!    The cocktails were delicious.  The pina colada was stunning.  It is NOT your margarita-machine Jimmy-Buffet-esque frozen beverage.  It's a real deal colada with coconut cream, coconut rum, and a whole lot of yummy.  I also tried the rum punch - they make a new one every day so it's always changing.  It was outstanding and I think it's probably good that it comes in small classes.  I'm pretty sure it's dangerous.   The food was honestly underwhelming.  My jerk shrimp was spiced well and I believe they were good quality prawns but they were overcooked and chewy.  My husband's jerk pork suffered the same fate of being dry.  He did enjoy the polenta that came with it.    I wouldn't pause for a second to come back here for drinks but I would probably dine elsewhere.",

Loud and hot inside (summer) and had a fly buzzing around we couldn't seem to get rid of. I can see why folks like it, but it's a bit limited and spicey for my taste.

We waited about 30-40 minutes to be seated.  Once they finally told us our table was ready, they sat us in the cigar room. The cigar room has 4 walls but no ceiling. I guess you can consider that outside, I dunno. However, there are no tables in the cigar room. How were we supposed to eat? We didn't want to wait any longer so we just made due. One look at the menu and I was suddenly full. Wow is this place expensive! $12+ for a cocktail? I ended up ordering the non-alcoholic carrot juice for $4. It was actually really good.  We ordered 2 appetizers to share between the 3 of us. We thought that would be enough, seeing that each appetizer was about $13. The appetizers ended up being more like samples. I was somewhat embarrassed in front of my our guest. We all had to fight over these tiny appetizers.The only upside to the night was the carrot juice and the attentive server who kept refilling our free water.  Overall, I would recommend this place only if you want to spend some major dough and still be hungry when you leave.",

    "text": "MUST GET: Hot Buttered Rum and a Tasting Flight!!!  Six months ago, I began my love affair with rum. I found out I would be working on the rums portfolio at Diageo. Initially, I thought I'd prefer to work on tequila or whisk(e)y - categories I felt were more exciting. I am happy to say I was completely wrong! The rum category still has a perception problem - it is so much more than fruity tropical drinks and rum & coke (these drinks have a time and place, but there is an entire WORLD out there). Experiencing traditional \"brown spirits\" cocktails with aged rum is divine - the Old Fashioned or Manhattan - as well as replacing gin in a Negroni, as one example :)  I'm home for the holidays and wanted to check out The Breadfruit & Rum Bar in Phoenix, Arizona. There aren't many bars dedicated to rum. Dedicated means there are no other spirits aside from rum! Yes, they have Red Stripe and Guinness beer (yay Diageo!) and select Arizona wines but THAT IS IT! They have a Rum Manifest that separates their 108+ rums into multiple categories: Premium Aged (think Zacapa 23 or Bacardi 8), Silver (10 Cane), Amber (Pyrat XO), Black (Goslings), Overproof (Goslings 151), and Cachaca (Ypioca). They also have cigar & rum pairings - loved to see Zacapa 23 paired with Arturo Fuente 858 (as a cool feature, you can even bring your own cigar to enjoy!). Finally, there are rum tasting flights. Naturally, I had to get the one with Zacapa XO...the most expensive flight :) The Grand Reserves taping is with English Harbour 10 Year Old, Appleton Estate 21 Years Old and Zacapa XO Solera Grand Reserve :)  As my cocktail, I got the Hot Buttered Rum, made with Gosling's Black Seal, house coconut liqueur, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and rum whip - THREE TYPES OF RUM! Dark rum, coconut rum and rum whipped cream? I mean...COME ON. Dessert cocktails are always a favorite of mine. So delicious!  The bartenders are the True stars of this rum bar. When I visited, Bryan and Danielle were behind the bar. They were patient and answered my (many!!) questions about the back bar, ingredients and whatever else I wanted to know about. We sat at the bar when we visited - this is always my preference. I love engaging in conversation with such masters of their craft!  I look forward to coming back here on my next visit home and sticking around for dinner! The Jamaican-influenced menu looks delicious! Whether you're a rum lover, rum novice or just a lover of bars, you must check out the Rum Bar at the Breadfruit!",

Yes, they make the food the way the want without substitution (cocktails are mixed the way they please too). Yes, you cannot eat on their back patio (boo hoo).  Yes, they only seat whole parties (not all that uncommon).  Get over it people. You want great, well balanced flavors and innovative rum cocktails (I recommend The Shorty) make reservations.

Definitely is on the smaller side, but it wasn't cramped or busy when we went. Our waiter was cool and helpful with details about the specials and menu. Their drink menu is extensive, basically all rum based, hence \"Rum Bar.\" They have a \"punch bowl special\" drink [$10] which changes daily which I tried. It was great, very heavy on the citrus side of things.   Their rum flights were such an awesome experience. They curated a list of 3 types of kinda similar rums and put them in different categories. For example, the category I chose was called \"the Masters.\" These are rums that have been aged for a while. You can only choose 1 category for your flight of 3. Can't take a drink from \"the Masters\" and a drink from the Brazilian rum category. Does that make sense? It's not your typical choose from the menu flight. Gotta try it even if you're not a rum fan, as I was not. It was just a cool experience. The \"Masters\" flight was $22 & came w/about a shot or a shot and a half pours.   The menu for Breadfruit was all enticing! They serve Caribbean cuisine & the flavors were spicy, but flavorful. We got the special appetizer of the day which was shrimp in their jerk chicken sauce on top of a flatbread [$14]. It was delicious & had a nice little kick. I went w/the salmon as that was the least spicy item on the menu [$34]. It did not disappoint. Salmon had a great taste & was cooked very well with the passion fruit sauce it came with. Came w/assorted veggies. Their signature Jerk Pork & Polenta [$20] was too spicy for me, but my partner enjoyed it, but couldn't finish since the spice crept up.  Great establishment overall. They also have a \"cigar bar\" which we did not take advantage of. If I'm ever back in PHX I'll be sure to visit here again to try more of their rum flights--which was the highlight of the night!",

It's kind of tucked away by itself but totally worth going to ! You enter to see a lively bar with a well dressed dapper bar tender who welcomed us - in addition to the hostess and was busy making colorful and exciting cocktails.   We were seated and addressed by a friendly and phenomenal server. I have a severe anaphylactic allergy and he was extremely knowledgeable, kind and even so said he'd triple check with the kitchen. The menu was diverse and I thought it was cool that they had more than jerk chicken or stereotypical 'island restaurant' items. The ambiance was low lit, romantic and intimate but with good lively energy.  Highly recommend!",

Sad night. Waitress made a mistake. Shrimp was definitely jerk. Dates in the salad were good. Altogether not so filling. I wasn't too upset, but I asked if they could possibly just give me a side of golden beets- as that was the salad was described of having..No Can Do. I was informed I would have to buy their grilled vegetables plate- ALONG with my salad. Great. This was literally my first meal of the day..at 9pm. Long day. Hangry. I think I'm going to end up in a Taco Bell line before I go home.  AND- We were a party of 5, and they added on the tip- $30. We all ordered 1 drink and 1 plate. A $30 tip is a bit much. This is my first and last time in this joint.",

    "text": "UnderTow might be the ship you arrive from, but The Breadfruit & Rum Bar is the port you arrive at!   Welcome to the Caribbean oasis in the middle of downtown Phoenix! You're welcomed with rum induced awakenings, fine cigars, and the smell of pimento wood smoked meats (around 5-6pm it's pretty strong).  There's a patio in the back for cigar smoking and drinks which has a great mural, plants, a water feature, and a lounge area. Inside are booths, tables, and bar seating. There's also a patio in the front of the restaurant accented by rope and wood for that pier effect.   We had the \"Punch Bowl Special\" which was a refreshing fruit medley of lemon juice, lime juice, passion fruit, mango, with lemongrass, nutmeg, and two different rums. Highly recommend trying this! We loved it! And it is actually ladled from a large punch bowl the bartender mixes that night, you can view it at the bar.  The food we had here was okay. We had the \"Pimento Wood Jerk Chicken\" which had 2 Cornish Game Hens jerked, grilled, and smoked with Pimento wood, with rice, house jerk sauce, and beets, radish tops, and squash. I liked how large this entree was for the price. Some of the meat was dry (mainly the breast) while other parts were very savory and tender. But we did like the flavor.  \"The Smoked Trout\" was not as good as the Jerk Chicken. This was trout smoked over Pimento wood, with two cauliflower cakes, raspberry jam, pickeled red onions, and feta goat cheese. If you like extreme flavors together, then this is for you. For me, the extreme salty flavors with the extreme sweet and the extreme sour did not appeal to me at all. I noticed when I came back the next evening to try something else \"The Smoked Trout\" combination has changed, maybe they improved it?  Service was okay, while the bartender was lively and friendly, the rest of the staff was not. Not terrible, just more serious and not as relaxed. When you're in a Caribbean setting, I think you subconsciously anticipate people being more relaxed.  I will be back for drinks at the bar or in the cigar lounge but probably not for the food.",

If you are lucky enough have their goat curry in season, the meal of choice is not a question. Otherwise, I've still never had a meal here that isn't one of the best I've had in all of Phoenix.   Their drinks... also the best in Phoenix. Their complexity of flavors and spices are unparalleled. If you are downtown and want a mind blowing drink, whether you a rum person or not, try this place. You won't be disappointed.   Their passion... having run into the owners/managers a few times, it is clear that their passion has perfectly translated into their food.

The pepper shrimp is spicy and fantastic, get it with a side of garlic bread. If you are lucky and they have the curried lamb as the special of the day, it is a must try.

I've known about this Rum Bar for years, but because so many places I care about keep closing down, I decided a couple of weeks ago that I'd stop taking it for granted and dive in.  If you come here at night, expect the most clandestine vibes. When you take your seat at the bar, it will feel as though you should whisper your order. You can start with something bright, like a rum punch that changes daily. You might not know what's in it, but you know it will be palatable. I needed something stiff. I went with The Garrison, with a nice, heavy, BURNT stick of cinnamon, as well as a tobacco tincture. It was tough. It took a while to finish. It put hair on my chest! But I can dig it.   On your way out, you can purchase a cigar to chase your spirits after a long night. I quit smoking, but I like the idea. Feels a little noir, come to think of it. I don't see myself as a regular here, but I like it as a cozy little corner for when I want something different.",

There was light music playing in the background and everything about this place was totally at our pace.  Our favorite drink was definitely the daily punch. It changes (yep, exactly) daily!

I'm not a fan of curry in the least but our server Brook convinced me that the curried shrimp was not anything like traditional curry. I took his advice and I have to say, it was one of the best shrimp dishes I've ever had. Served with rice, plantains and some veggies, it was so full of flavor and just the right amount of food for me. I would definitely eat here again.",

Our server was super knowledgeable about the drinks and the menu in general. He also took a drink off the bill that one of our party didn't finish.  The timing and pace of the meal was leisurely, which was perfect for a special occasion meal. Don't rush your time here!  We had the clams and the plantains as appetizers. If you're looking for crispy textured fried plantains, you'll be disappointed, but the flavors were rich. The clams were excellent- probably my favorite food item.  For the main course, I had the swordfish steak. It was perfectly cooked, but not spicy like the dishes the other three in my group ordered. I almost wish it was a little spicy but the carrot puree and the peanut sauce were a delicious combination.  The highlights of the meal were the drink choices. You can't go wrong here.  Because it was my birthday, I received a free rum pour of what was probably the best rum I've ever had. I'll definitely be back before next year!  Sweetly, at the end of the meal, we received postcards to write that they mail for you. I thought it was a lovely touch for a special occasion. Overall, the food was good, but the experience as a whole was above and beyond.",

We arrived at the time of our reservation, but our table wasn't ready yet so the hostess led us to their back patio where we could order drinks and wait for our table. Our waiter was friendly and good natured, answering questions we had and making recommendations about drinks and the food. Once our table was ready, we were promptly seated. Our drinks came out shortly thereafter and we also ordered some dishes to share. My first drink was a hurricane Charlie, it was well balanced with the rum and fruit flavors, I don't like passion fruit but the flavor wasn't overpowering the drink. We also ended up getting a round of pina coladas and they were delicious. I didn't try all of the food dishes, but the jerk shrimp and Johnny cake was delicious.",

This time we tried Tamarind Ball II which was pretty refreshing, Black Magic Woman- it has coffee taste so if you love coffee it's a great choice, The Garrison- pretty interesting in taste and has a cigar in it! And the Hurricane Charlie which was a favorite one of all! If you had the hurricane cocktail in NOLA, this one is a few levels above it and better! The waitress was nice and helpful with the drink choices. The atmosphere is very cosy and warm with good music playing in the background. They have a really cool outside area in the back which I highly recommend to check out. The only drawback is that outside everyone smokes cigars and if you don't like the smoke smell, you won't be able to enjoy your drinks there... Their menu looks delicious, especially if you like Jamaican food so next time we will definitely come out for dinner there as well!",

The server \"Adru or Rari\" was openly annoyed when we said we weren't going to be drinking.   He stomped off and returned 3 other times VERY RUDELY interrupting our conversation to see what else we wanted..... It was 30 minutes into our date and he asked if we would want dessert. When we said no he wanted to know if we wanted the tab. My date and I were shocked. We said no and the server says, \"Oh so you just want to hang out?\" Ummm yea we mumbled 5 minutes later drops off the check.   We weren't there even an hour. We SAT DOWN at 7pm and left at 7:45pm. Even though we said we were hanging out; guess that's not allowed. We were being shooed out. I made a reservation there were empty tables so we didn't understand why he wanted us to leave. My date reluctantly paid... Then the server informs us that we needed to fill out the bottom. He wanted us to tip him on the card before he ran the CC as typically done.   We've never been asked to do this before. So my date asked him why? We just do it that way here that way we can just get it done at once. Just strange the entire night was uncomfortable and frankly, he ruined our date. Little did this guy know my date had to take strong medicine that night and couldn't drink. Why should we have to explain ourselves?  I was a server for years and had we been permitted to stay longer I would would've made sure we tipped far above the 20% range. The bottom line is this server ruined our evening. I drove 40 minutes to the Breadfruit because I have enjoyed myself there in the past and this servers unprofessionalism did not make it worth our while.  It is sad that a server is so anxious to turn a table and make $$$$ that it will cause him to short sell the experience of a restaurant as different as The Breadfruit.",

And while we're at it, when a customer can't eat the over-acidy and untasty, messy coleslaw, and can't eat the main dish, and has devoured the one-eight piece of corn that passes a vegetable, do not--may I repeat, DO NOT charge for a second tiny piece of corn.

Not very many places in this town live up to that expectation, but the Breadfruit goes above and beyond. The Breadfruit focuses on bringing Caribbean flavors to Phoenix while using locally grown, fresh, organic produce. Small kitchen, small restaurant, one chef. It's almost as though they've invited you into their house for a meal. EVERYTHING is cooked to order, which makes all of the difference, hence why they don't do takeout. Staff is always friendly, but they are not there to kiss your ass, if that's what you want go to a larger corporate restaurant where one small complaint will get your entire meal comp'ed and you'll have a manager there with his nose up your arse for the rest of the evening. The breadfruit is there to share their food with you and a great experience.  -Curried Tofu  -Scallops  -Patties (talapia)  -Brown Stew Chicken  -HAVE to try \"My favorite carrot juice\" it's addicting -oh and of course it's BYOB !",

    "text": "I tasted Breadfruit's sweet potato bread pudding for the first time at this years West of Western. (and then a second, third and fourth time until they asked me to stop eating all of their samples...) So when contemplating restaurants for my birthday dinner Breadfruit was at the top of a very short list.   Since I work in wine I think Breadfruit's BYOB policy is fantastic. Ignore anyone on here who complains about the $5 corkage fee because the markup most restaurants put on a bottle of wine is well over five bucks (usually it's 2-3 times what they paid!).  Plus BYOB allows you to bring exactly what you want to complement your meal (I would suggest a dry riesling, gewurztraminer or an un-oaked chardonnay).   The menu is small but there were plenty of options, even for vegetarians! I would have happily eaten everything from the appetizers section, but my dining pals and I set our sights on the plaintain avocado spring roll that is baked, not fried! I thought it was a creamy slice of deliciousness, and the accompanying chutney did not disappoint. My main dish was the Bok Choy and Mashed Sweet Potato....alright I've spent about 5 minutes sitting here staring at the screen because I don't know how to describe how great my meal was. Here's an idea: YUM. oh my gosh it was delicious, each ingredient and seasoning was a perfect and direct complement to all the rest. It was filling too, I mean, bok choy and mashed potatoes, that sounds like two side dishes to a \"real\" meal, but this meal is the real deal. Finally, I went ahead and ordered the bread pudding again for dessert, it's just dense and lightly sweet and so satisfying. mmmm.   Breadfruit's staff were very friendly and attentive and Daryl even came over to check on us at the end of the meal. The dining room wasn't crowded but we were being very loud (per usual) and no one seemed to mind in the least. What a great experience and delightful setting for a group of friends to celebrate the year's most important date: my birthday.",

While employees are nice and professional, you will get nowhere asking, for example, for a virgin drink with no alcohol. On both visits we had non-drinkers and simply asked if we could get one of their signature drinks made with no booze. It is almost a scripted answer: \"No, we do not do that...\" Certainly can understand this if the ingredients may have mixes that also contain alcohol, but come on...with such remarkable mixologists (jus ask them, they will tell you!) it seems implausible that a non-drinker could not be accommodated. This was a trend, because on our first visit someone in our party asked if they could get a particular run drink made with a touch of ginger (I believe that was it) and again, \"No, we do not do that...\" Really? Since when did a rum bar become as set in their ways as a German deli? It is a great place with, we are sure, great food (we have just tried some bites and desserts), but the ownership definitely needs to relax a bit because you can almost see the waiters wanting to accommodate you...but they apparently cannot.",

My friend was really happy with his jerk prawns and rice while I had the brown chicken stew which was really flavorful.

    "text": "I've been to Breadfruit a couple of times now. My most recent experience was in the last 48 hours with a couple of friends. I should start this review my noting that I love Jamaican food. In general, I love foods that mix fruity and spicy, and yet aren't too heavy on the stomach.   For the food, the coleslaw and corn are excellent side items. The bread is decent, and interesting flavour, though a bit on the tough side. For main dishes I have had the jerk chicken and jerk prawns. Indeed, for me, the jerk chicken was the better. The shrimp was not filling at all... $15 for 5 prawns is not only a rip-off for a restaurant that serves with paper napkins, but it leaves you wanting more...in a bad way. The plantain and avocado rolls are perhaps the only thing on the menu worth the price. They are perfectly paired with the mango chutney. The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well. The waiter might have done well by us to mention that the \"half order\" for $12 had only 2 medium-sized scallops. For $21, you could get the \"full order\", but then, what's the point? Also at the table was a house salad of sorts, which while it has potential, went half-eaten.  Also, a plus, they have finally gotten a beer license, so they can finally serve, appropriately, Jamaican Red Stripe lager. At $4.50, it isn't the best deal in downtown Phoenix though. Nickel and dimed again!  As for the service and management, there are not positive signs for this restaurant. It has managed to stay in business, and good on them. On the other hand, while the decor is nice and pleasant - typical Jamaican with it's yellow and green walls, the place is noisy. And that is odd considering we were the only three patrons in the restaurant. Management would do well to put up a plexiglass room divider. The restaurant does have a nice glass facade, which allows a pleasant view of the street. Unfortunately, the location is on 1st and Pierce, which offers some of the worst views in all of downtown Phoenix. Alas, this location goes to waste. It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down. My last impression is of the wait staff. While the staff two years ago was helpful and polite, we three agreed that the new staff was pushy and unhelpful. Over and over, we were pushed to order items we insisted we didn't want. And when it came to selling us on the dishes and informing us of the small skewer of prawns or the 2-scallop appetizer, he seemed to have forgotten. I guess it's a bit like a used car salesman.  Too bad I can't think of another Jamaican restaurant in Phoenix, I'd love to try it next time!",

    "text": "This is an amazing little treasure in downtown Phoenix. Being from Houston and frequenting NYC regularly, Breadfruit is the perfect little mix. It is situated on a quiet street reminicent of midtown in Houston. The authentic food is so NYC-spicy and savory.  I had the Jerk Shrimp and it rocked. The spice was hot enough to satisfy my appetite. The sweet potatoe pudding was a great way to top off the spicy shrimp.  The staff is super friendly and accomodating. I loved the sidewalk bistro set up. Coffee is served in a French press.  Between the charm and wonderful food, I am going to crave this place all the way from Houston.",

    "text": "The Breadfruit balances chic-dining with sensible, 'everyman' prices and simple (authentic) presentation.  Some dishes are very spicy (seasoned w/ habanero), so avoid these if you're adverse to hot/spicy.  Rum Sangria was brilliantly mixed, and coffee beans add an extra level to the aroma. Even still, I was left wondering if putting rum in sangria was really necessary. The Breadfruit's mixed drinks are for people with a particular affinity for rum. Otherwise, do not try them. The season pear-rum cocktail was way too rum'y. The ingredients did not pair well, I thought.  Sea scallop appetizer: Scallops cooked just right. Great dish. But the pricing doesn't fit my comments above.   Overall, I applaud The Breadfruit for being unique, yet unpretentious, in a manner True to Jamaica.  Dinner: Saturday, 10/9/2010. 5:45-7pm. The two of us share two cocktails (seasonal pair and rum sangria), the sea scallop appetizer, and entrees: jerk chicken off the grille and curried chicken w/ dumplings.",

If, also like me, you prefer to have a few options for inexpensive beer and wine to accompany your worldly cuisine, you knock off one star.   We split the avocado spring rolls to start - basically a wrapped up slice of avocado and mango, served with a sweet chutney.  I enjoyed them, but I am starting to admit that despite being raised in California and adoring Mexican food, I will never really like avocados. But if you love them like everybody in the world except me, you will like this app.   We then shared the tofu curry and the bok choy stir fry. These were both delish, and a good value at $10 each.   I was happy enough with my Red Stripe for $4, but disappointed by the selection of only 3 wines, two of which I think cost $14/glass.   All in all, very cute place, good food, and a place you feel happy to support.",

Ok fine, we didn't have time to find somewhere else at that point. A drink at the bar, with tamarind was good, another with the rum punch special wasn't bad. The meal: portions were quite small, the pork belly was decent, mackerel was sub par.  Service was poor, I ordered a drink halfway through which just never came, despite asking twice. Then they tacked on an unannounced $26 dollar \"service fee\". For 2 people! Ridiculous, this wasn't printed on the special menu.  It's too bad their greed and poor service ruined our experience. I can't support a restaurant that gouges customers on \"special occasions\".  I am a generous tipper, usually 20% with good service, but I resent feeling taken advantage of. These seems like quite a myopic business strategy, they might win some, but they just lost one, they lost us for good.",

    "text": "Okay. So, I decided to head to Downtown again for the Digital Downtown contest. This time, I was walking around the area at 8 a.m. There's really something to say about watching a city wake up and walking about 2 miles canvasing the streets. Ultimately, though, I've come to the realization that, at best, I take photos that could cut it as an amateur postcard but generally lack any artistic appeal.  But something good came out of this: Breadfruit. It was one of the areas in which I was walking and stumbled upon. Literally. I wasn't watching where I was walking and, doop, there's the curb. Not uncommon for me. Being all matiche, I peeked in the window because the music was cranked up. As I was walking away, a lady opened the door and let me know they opened for lunch at noon, showed me the menu and suggested the jerk chicken, since I'd not had Jamaican food before. It's always delightful to find the owners jamming out outside of operating hours. So Rob M and I went for lunch.  We started off with Jamaican sodas, which were really sweet yet good. I had the ginger beer and it's hellavalotta ginger (it was way strong). Rob had the cola champagne which was like cream soda. Rob ordered the jerk chicken and I ordered the curried chicken and dumpling. Since the jerk chicken was going to take 15 minutes, we started out with a spicy beef pattie and a chicken curry pattie. I started with half of the beef and it was good spicy, but the chicken was amazing. I could mack on those all day long. Our entrees arrived and we dug in. My dish was very flavorful and the recommendation of the server was to eat the dumpling with the sauce. Good idea, since the dumpling itself doesn't have a very defined flavor and it particularly dense. (If you're thinking granny's chicken and dumplings, this isn't it.) The jerk chicken was so spicy that Rob couldn't finish it. He did find that eating it with a bite of pineapple helped to cut the heat, but it was still Hades hot. Apparently, if you order the carrot juice with this dish, it counters the atomic heat. Seriously, Rob can handle spicy but this was perhaps too much.  Overall, it was a good experience. There were a handful of other diners there at 12:30 when we arrived and people were coming throughout our meal. I'm thinking this is probably authentic Jamaican cooking, and not an Americanized version of it. I would have liked more salt but I didn't ask because I was in for the authenticity of the meal.  Really, 3.5 stars. But I'll bump it up because the setting is nice, service was good, and it's in a cool neighborhood--it's tucked into a residential area not too far from the new ASU campus. And I liked my meal. This will be a place to which we'll return.",

    "text": "it was girls night out - dinner before going to see chelsea handler perform at comerica theatre.  first thought as we entered was the place was quaint, clean, good music, and empty - we were the second table to be sat for dinner at 5:15.      we ordered drinks - all rum, by the way - a couple of the gals were shocked that a rum bar didn't serve vodka, so we were off to a great start....My Mojito Ponganot was amazing and that is the only good thing I have left to say about this place.  we ordered appetizers: the oven roasted plantains - just meh and we also ordered the fresh baked patty - one tilapia and one spinach. I thought the crust was a bit on the dry side - two of us 4 thought they were good - good enough to order another one - which ended up never being served to us.  the major disappointment was the one entree that we made this trip for was \"sold out\"  - hmmm   we were the second table to be seated - the other table hadn't ordered yet and what is it you ask that they \"sold out\" of - why the popcho & sweet ginger - basically baby bok choy - wow now that is an ingredient you can't find oh, i don't know EVERYWHERE.....???     we ended up eating salads - which were good, fresh, but frankly could have made just as easily at home.   the bread that was offered and not on menu and therefore assumed to come with the meal was breadsticks with a hint of vanilla - good, but 2 sticks for almost $5 - no thanks.   the kicker was when we asked them to call us a cab...we sat for 10 minutes and nothing - we asked again and finally this time saw them pick up a phone.   we were then told we could sit outside to free up the table - this was after paying our $200 tab.  I have never had this occur at a restaurant.  yes, i know it was a friday night, but we were finishing our drinks, we had paid and tipped WELL and think that they could afford to have us sit there for 10 minutes waiting on a cab they forgot to call.  I \"might\" have returned even based on the lackluster food - just for the drink, but I can certainly say after the rudeness we would never return",

    "text": "~~~~UPDATE~~~~ We went back to Breadfruit last night, and I must revise my original review to reflect our experience, which deserved more stars.  When we arrived at 7pm on Saturday night, the place was packed.  There wasn't enough room to push two tables together in order to accommodate our party of 4, so we walked around the block until some tables were open.  The waitress was extremely nice and we were seated about 20 minutes later.  For appetizers, we ordered the avocado spring rolls and the roasted plantains.  Despite being small portions, they were both very good.  I was inspired to go get some plantains in the Asian market this morning in order to try to make them at home.  As an entree, I ordered the curried tofu again.  I wanted to try something else (the Ital soup or the veggie patty), but they were out of a vital component of each dish, and they don't make the soup in the summer.  When my entree came out, I was initially really disappointed to see that they had made it with chicken, again.  I asked the waitress and she assured me that what I was seeing was actually a soy product and I had nothing to worry about.  I must say, it was disturbingly, uncomfortably meat-like.  So much so that I made my husband try it and tell me that it was in fact non-meat before I would put it in my mouth.  When I did eat it, it even had the texture of meat - very disconcerting.  The flavor was excellent, and I would definitely order this entree again - if I can get over the extremely realistic meat analog.  The sides were good (definitely better flavor since last time), especially mixed with the curry sauce.  I have to issue a heartfelt apology to Wayne and The Breadfruit for the disparaging review that I wrote after my last visit.  I should have called to ask about the dish and had them clarify that my dish was, in fact, fake meat.  It has been so long since I ate chicken (and I don't generally eat fake meat), that I truly thought it was meat.  (Lesson:  Don't assume anything!)  My dinner companions all ordered a chicken dish, and all enjoyed them thoroughly.  I tried the festivals (breadstick) from someone's meal, and I have to say that Breadfruit should offer a basket of those as an appetizer.  Yum.  When we were almost finished with our meal, the waitress brought us full sized samples of the carrot juice.  Another Yum!  It tasted a lot like Thai Iced tea - similar seasonings, and very rich and creamy.    I will definitely go back to Breadfruit.  The food was good (Festivals=crack), the atmosphere and the service is EXCELLENT, and it is close to home.    Home Run, Breadfruit.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Downtown Phoenix NEEDS a Jamaican restaurant (and an Ethiopian, Italian, Mexican, etc), and I have waited anxiously for Breadfruit to open - riding my bike by there every afternoon for weeks looking for any sign of life.    Finally, just this week, I see people eating there.  So, we went for lunch today ( at 12:45... at the end of the lunch rush), of course, we arrived at the exact same moment  as Phil Gordon.   I think we threw them off a little bit by ordering our meal to go, but they don't get a by for that.  The wait was long (35 minutes), but they were really busy, and they just opened, and the mayor was there, so it was understandable.  We forgave.  The lone waiter brought me a Fiji water, It tided me over slightly.  I was excited to see several \"vegan\" options on the menu - mostly sides, but it looks like some of the entrees can be modified to fit vegetarian requirements.    I ordered the curried tofu (that is the name printed on the menu, no modifications!), which comes with sides of steamed plantains, beans/rice, and steamed cabbage/green bell peppers.  Unfortunately, I recieved curried chicken, a fact that I discovered after getting back to my office... and I was WAY too starving to go back to get it fixed.  I ate around the chicken, something I am normally loathe to do... but as I said, STARVING.  The beans and rice = bland.  Nothing spectacular, they were just that: beans and rice.  Plantains = undercooked.  Just slightly.  I wanted them to be so much better than they were.  Cabbage/Green Bell pepper = boring.  They were just steamed cabbage and green pepper.  I love cooked cabbage, but with salt please!  Nothing that I ate was seasoned at all.  I had bite or two of the curry sauce since it was touching the rice (starving!), and it tasted ok... am I allowed to pass judgement on a sauce that was poured over something I don't ever eat (because I think it is disgusting)?  Its hard to say.  Admittedly, I would have enjoyed this meal A LOT more if I had recieved a meal that did not contain meat.    I will probably go back... Breadfruit is new, and they deserve another chance.  I will definitely eat in, and I will try David's reccomendation of the avocado rolls.  One strike.  They haven't struck out just yet.",

    "text": "Well, after a year and a few months of living a stones throw from Breadfruit, I finally made it in there.  To be honest with you I was not very impressed and left with a bad taste in my mouth.  I love supporting the local restaurants in my downtown, but I don't think I will be returning.  The girlfriend and I decided to come for dinner and we were both really excited to try the food.  We were seated promptly and greeted by our server, Craig, I think.  He was great with describing the food and how spicy and offered his recommendations.  We had the pumpkin soup to start with some of the Festival bread.  The soup was tasty, but was luke warm.  We both expected hot, maybe even a gazpacho-like soup, but luke warm?  It had a nice kick that snuck up on you, but the temperature really changed it.  The bread was really tasty though and we moved on to the entrees.  She had the chicken and dumpling dish.  The sauce had a curry taste to it and was very good.  The dumplings, while thick and hearty were good as well.  I opted for the Jerk Prawns.  Now, when I see Prawns on the menu I am expecting 3, maybe 4, *very* large shrimp, especially for $14.50.  When I got my plate I was underwhelmed to say the least.  I saw 5 medium shrimp on a skewer.  I will say they did taste good, but for the price I felt a little bent over.  The dish was accompanied by a cabbage slaw and a slice of grilled pineapple.  Overall, tasty but over priced.  What really got me was the bill, granted we each had a drink, and I knew how much mine was, it was $60 before gratuity.  Looking at the receipt I saw the Festival bread, which sounded like it came with the soup, was $3.50!  Two sticks of bread!  Needless to say I was just overcome with a sense of disappointment after hearing such great things.",

They make great mixed rum drinks, but even sipping on some of the nicer rums they have is a fun experience.

    "text": "I went here twice: the first time for dinner and the second time for lunch. Had I only went there for dinner, my review might not be so good. Both times, I went there with vegan friends eager to try a new place in the valley.   We had dinner on a Thursday. They only have street parking. We got there around 5 or 6, and the waitress said we were the first people there all day. One other group of people eventually showed up. For dinner, we had the plantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney. No complaints here - a good appetizer and the chutney was delicious. I then had the coco bread & pattie sandwich - okay, this was weird. The \"pattie\" looks like a combination of an empanada and a Hot Pocket which they put between two slices of delicious coco bread. So, I only ate the bread. We shared the sweet potato pudding for dessert. Pretty good, no complaints. When we were done, we waited for 30 min. or so for our check. I think she forgot about us, but she was really nice so we didn't care.  For lunch, we first shared Festivals as an appetizer. From the reviews I'd previously read here, I expected them to be so delicious that my tastebuds would jump out of my mouth, but that's what you get for having expectations that are too high.. they were two miniature breadsticks. Yes, their bread is great, and only $2, so why not? Also, they were very soft/warm. I then had the curried chicken and dumpling and my friend had curried tofu. My only complaint is that some of the food is too dry, like the green bananas and the dumpling. The dumpling was this dry, solid mass of wheat that I used as a pincushion for my fork - or, a forkcushion. The plantains were DELICIOUS, as were the chicken and veggies. The chicken was not dry, despite some reviews I've read to the contrary.  My friend finished his plate in a few minutes and told the waitress that it was one of the best meals he's ever had. However, he was initially concerned with the tofu - it tasted so much like meat that he figured it wasn't tofu, but was assured it wasn't meat. The waitress told us that the guy cooking behind the counter is also the owner and got all of the recipes from his grandmother in Jamaica.  We ended lunch with the grapenut ice cream and jello. By the time you're almost done, it morphs into strawberry ice cream. Very good. Everything was fresh - I'll go back if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "Excited about my first dining experience today at the breadfruit at 108 E Pierce St downtown Phoenix. Learned about the establishment while researching  suggested restaurants from my companies vendor for a large group coming to town in March. Was told at 6:10pm that there was a two hour wait and that it's best to make a reservation before dining. Well of course I was not going to wait two hours to eat dinner. So we left. Then it hit me, the white couple in front of us that arrived at the same time wasn't leaving nor did they have reservations. Why were they staying and we weren't?!?! So at 6:17pm I called the restaurant from my car to make a 7pm reservation. The same person, Dwayne (who said he was the owner) told me he could accommodate us at 7:30pm. Definitely not two hours. Maybe my voice didn't sound Black like my face looked. What a huge let down!!! I will do my best to spread the word about my unfortunate experience at breadfruit.",

    "text": "I generally dislike seafood, but I fell in love with Caribbean food during my honeymoon in the Bahamas. The flavors were so wonderful and the quality and freshness of the ingredients so much different than I had grown up with, that it truly changed my perspective. I still may not clamor for seafood (and still greatly prefer milder fish to the more robust and fishier options), but I appreciate fresh seafood when I can get it.  Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered not only fantastic fresh seafood in the middle of downtown, but also a restaurant that brought the flavors of my honeymoon rushing back. Breadfruit pleased from the get-go when my wife and I ate there recently.   One of the seafoods I like least is scallops, a fact I am coming to accept is because they are typically frozen and overcooked to a displeasing rubbery texture. I have only ever eaten scallops at one restaurant (Moto) that were good. Still, my wife loves scallops and I love jerk flavors, so we ordered the Appleton Rum Sea Scallops, which are covered in a jerk rub. Suffice to say, I now have eaten two scallop dishes I love. The jerk seasoning was wonderfully spicy and the scallops were perfectly seared and cooked until they were just translucent in the center. They were soft enough to cut with a fork and practically melted in your mouth.  For dinner, I had the Escovitch Fish, which was Atlantic red snapper on the day we dined. Red snapper is a fish I discovered in the Bahamas, and this dish reminded me how good it can be. The filet was cooked perfectly and the escovitch sauce - essentially a spicy vinegar mixture - was quite good, as were the pickled vegetables that accompanied it.   After much deliberation, my wife chose the Brown Stew Chicken which, while complexly flavored, was quite dry and overcooked, which was a shame. Her dish was the one blemish on our meal, but the rest of the food was so good (and the untried items on the menu so appetizing) that we will definitely return.  Also, a note: The portions are small, but this is an upscale Caribbean restaurant, where the focus is much more on quality over quantity.",

The kitchen is close and within view.  The Wait staff is extremely knowledgable, friendly and ready with a great and candid assesment of what's \"great\" on the menu that day and what's not.  The cocunut/carrot juice drinks are absolutely amazing.  I think this spot is best as an off-downtown lunch spot as it can get pretty crowed (and hence uncomfortable) during week-end evenings.  I definitely give it an enthusiastic recommendation and am certain you will love the food!",

The service was great (Emily was fantastic and SO helpful - even when I called to get directions) and the owner, Daryl stopped by our table after the meal to make sure everything was alright.  What a nice guy!  I guess if I had a critique to make, it would be that the appetizers should be larger.  They're very inexpensive, so in retrospect we should have ordered two or three of the avacado spring rolls and empanadas - but, I would have preferred them to be priced as two or three instead of one. Other than that, the food was great.  I ordered the curried tofu (excellent choice) and cleaned the plate.  Martha ordered the Jerk Chicken (HOT HOT HOT) and Binnie ordered the Chicken and Dumplings, which was unique and really tasty.   All three of us said that we'd definitely go back again.",

She could have told us that when we were seated, and shrimp comprises about half of their menu.  Duh?  Food was good.  Not fantastic.  But solidly good.  The festival bread sticks were delicious.  We had an incredibly fresh piece of snapper that was really well prepared.  While I did not like the seasoning on the curry chicken, the meat itself was very fresh and juice and did not taste like factory farm chicken, but good free range meat.",

The server kept just wandering back and forth between the kitchen and dining room without doing anything. We had to try several times every time we wanted to get his attention. Also a note on the menu. -  I am extremely pick (I know this so I try to keep it in perspective). I have been a vegetarian since I was 10 and do not like meat at all. I ordered the tofu, but when it came out it looked more like chicken, and the texture was like chicken. I asked my boyfriend to try a piece and he thought it was chicken as well. After several attempts we got the server's attention and asked him if he was sure they made tofu and not chicken by mistake. This is where our serves becomes unbelievable. The guy actually yells at me that \"it is not chicken, it is tempeh not chicken!\" (tempeh is a soy product, but is not tofu. It should not be listed as tofu on the menu) If it had been listed correctly on the menu I would not have ordered it because I already know I do not like it. I did not know how to react. I ended up just eating the rice, and the server ignored us the rest of the meal. He came back to pick up the plates noticing I did not eat it and didn't say a word or offer to take it off the bill. It then took us another 10 minutes at least to get him to pick up the bill. I will never go back here!",

I was impressed with their drink selection.  There were only a few other people in the small restaurant when I sat down to wait 15-20 minutes for my food. The ginger beer was good, it had a nice strong bite to it. When I got back to the office to enjoy my salad, I was a little surprised.  The flavor of the salad was really good and the ingredients were fresh, however the spice on the chicken made it very, very spicy. I would say it was a little too much for my taste, and I enjoy spicy food. I just don't like my food so hot that my eyes start to water and I can't stop sniffling from my nose running.  Now, maybe it's not always that hot, and that was a one time thing . . . hard to say. I'm thinking I should go back and give it (or something else on the menu) another try. Everything looked way to good to give up on this place after only one spicy chicken incident!",

A unique bar in any major city in the known world. It has one of the most legit expensive cocktails in the united states. Their is extreme value as the quality of the food is fine dining. There is no way to mirror the drinks as the essences and bitters are made in house. You can pick up in suttlties in every bite as there is always something new to be discovered. The amount of knowledge between the chef and head bartender (whom are both owners and have the courage to put their name on their own place) is unmatched by any point in recordable history as it would be impossible for any chef nor bartender in the past (based on modern communication technology) to have such a vast range of flavors with such an acute delivery. I am positive if you didn't enjoy yourself here you were too drunk and they were worried about your safety, you were extremely rude as their employees are not slaves, your lack of tact offended other tactful guests and you were asked to leave, or you simply want to be cheap and think complaining will make them lower their quality. Their menu is ever changing.  I have worked at 50 plus bars in restaurants in two major cities, I possess 13 years in the industry and offer no favors to anyone. This is the perfect place for multiple courses during a date you're guaranteed to impress, A great place to splurge or have a quick two courses with a cocktail or two. Within the bar there is high quality rum and rum that will never be available to the world again.  Two years ago I couldn't stand rum and now I want to be Jamaican. Clean and trustworthy. If you made an ass of yourself before you need not worry as this place holds no grudges so long as you MIND YOUR MANNERS!",

We ate there once several months ago. In fact, I think it was their first week open for business. My girlfriend and I were impressed, and did come back, even though their tasty veggie meat was out of stock, and couldn't make us the veggie meals we came seeking that day.  Fast forward to last weekend. Some friends scored four Diamondbacks tickets, and I thought, since we'll have some drinks at the stadium, why not try Breadfruit again? We could take the light rail, and it's only two or three blocks from the light rail station.  We brought a six pack of Red Stripe to complete the experience, and it was a delight to be back. We saw one of the owners, who we recognized and liked when we met her, but didn't see her partner, who is the cook and is Jamaican. Our friends were impressed by the food, which held it's own.  We had fish escovich, jerk chicken, coconut curry tofu and side orders of plantains. All hits. Everything was cooked to order, and impressed our friends. The steamed veggies and rice and beans on my plate were delicious, and complimented my coconut curry tofu (it's actually a little more like seitan). Their BYOB policy worked well, as we were able to finish off a six-pack and get back to the light rail to head to Chase Field.  Good people, excellent food and an ambiance that is worthy of a downtown Phoenix revival. Good work, Breadfruit. I wish others would take your lead.",

She liked my dish too, but said hers was better (a bit competitive too).  I had the Coconut Curry Tofu. It had amazing and unique tastes, Absolutely delicious.

The atmosphere is very intimate and relaxed with soft music playing in the background and little white candles lining the window frames. For appetizers I had the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls ($8) and the Pimento Wood Smoked Mussels. The Rolls paired really well with the Mango Chutney that they were paired with but the texture inside the Roll was a little too mushy for me, the Roll itself was crunchy but I wish there was some type of nut inside to break the monotony. I couldn't resist ordering a Mai Tai ($9) which was absolutely delicious! My Entree was the Red Stripe Curried Prawns  ($10.50). The Prawns were in fact amazing and served with rice, beans, plantains and bell peppers. For Dessert I had the Pineapple Upside Down Cake ($9.50)- but the only thing that was upside down was my smile when I tasted this tiny dry sad excuse of a dessert. For $9.50 I expected that dessert to knock off my heels and round out a fantastic food evening. Some things to note: they will not split bills (nightmare for a party of 10), Parking is either by meter or pay-lot, Restroom is uni-sex with the toilet directly facing the urinal (ughh! Gross!). Overall the (most) food was really good and unique the prices are just a little too high for the portion size.",

It was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  It was not fresh at all!  Very over priced!  For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  I will never be back for the food.  The Rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it.",

For dessert I had a sweet potato pudding which the server described as a cake like texture.  It was closer to a pie. On the positive side the Sorrel drink was good and vibe was OK with Jamaican music playing in the background.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here last night with our baby girl. The restaurant was mostly empty at about 7pm on a Thursday night. It has a small urban restaurant decor with brightly colored walls and photos of Jamaican locals and items. The windows were filled with little glass votives with tea lights in them. The people in the kitchen and the waiter were friendly and greeted us on the way in and thanked us on the way out.   We ordered the sorel and some drink made with mangoes, mint and tea for drinks, the Jerk chicken and the Escovitch Fish and Festival for our entrees. We skipped the appetizers to save room for dessert. I like the sorel, but my wife thought it was too spicy for her tastes. It has a very strong ginger taste to it. We both liked the mango mint tea drink. The Jerk chicken was good. I didn't think it was too spicy at all. It definitely left a presence on the tongue, but nothing that was unbearable or really unexpected. The Escovitch fish was supposed to be spicy as well per the waiter, but it wasn't as spicy as he made it out to be. My wife really liked the bread sticks with the vanilla scent. We had the sweet potato bread pudding for dessert and had to order seconds. It has a nice crunchy coconut top which contrasts wonderfully with the soft inner bit.   The menu overall is limited, but I didn't think this was a problem. Portions are appropriate and not overwhelming in size so you don't feel like a blimp when you leave. Dessert wasn't large enough to split. That or it was just really good. The restaurant does have a BYOB alcohol policy, so if you want a beer or some wine it's 5$ corkage fee for the wine and 1$ per bottle for beer. Most places I've seen with a BYOB policy charge 10$ for wine. The service was good. Only issue is that almost all the parking near by is metered, so remember to bring some change for the meter.",

    "text": "I've had the luxury and the pleasure to have eaten the BEST Jamaican food prepared.  So I'm a bit biased. Haling from Flatbush NY, where everybody and their mama is a chef.  Oh and I've had the opportunity to eat at an actually Jamaican restaurant in Jamaica.  I'm more than biased.  I was hungry. My hunny was hungry.  We were hot and tired of fast food.  So we decided to trek via the steel horse to this quaint restaurant. Decorum:  Decorum: paint job was nice.  Yellow and green walls. Pictures of Jamaican food.  Local art.  Jamaican paintings.  Nice candles. Small tables,  Nice environment for couples.  Tables outside.  No one was outside because it was hot ass 99 degree hell.    Bob Marley, is what I sang along to while I waited patiently for my food.  We held our breathe.  This is Phoenix after all.  There are no Jamaicans here. So I thought. Service:  When entering the restaurant everyone behind the counter said HI!  I felt like I was at  Blockbuster.  They were as happy to see us as I was hungry to eat my food. The lone waiter looked like a hippy, not Jamaican.   And i knew he wasn't Jamaican, because he had a New Jersey accent.  And he was err um not Black. THE FOOD:  I ordered they brown stew chicken, with rice and peas and huge heep of cabbage. Never had it prepared that way.  Never want to eat a huge slimy hard to cut heap of cabbage again.  Try shredding it, please. One red and one green pepper slice.  And to my dismay two puny slices of plantains.  Yes I was disappointed. For that is the best part of a Jamaican dish.  I eyed my dates plate for his and he had his arms guarding his plate like a prisoner in jail.  So no, not enough plantains.  The rice and peas tasted like Indian rice.  It looked like Indian rice.  In fact it was Indian bismati rice.  The chef told me himself. Jamaicans dont eat bismati rice.  Its too expensive. They eat white rice with beans.  I was confused, but i was hungry and i did eat it.   No ginger beer available.  But the carrot juice was not so bad.  And the three dollar glass of ice tea  was OK because my boyfriend ordered it, but then he drank my drink. Because it was bleh.  Liquor was available, but read below why we didn't indulge.    The prices:  Pretty steep for a Jamaican restaurant.  But I was hungry, and not paying.  Two meals and two drinks came to a whooping $29.  My boyfriend gave a measly three dollar tip.  Mostly because he was a decent waiter and times are hard. And because  there were more staff there than customers.  And they were watching our every move.    Synopsis: Surprisingly, I ate everything on my plate.  My hunny ate everything on his plate.  And then tried to eat my food, because he paid for it.  (wink) So it wasn't that bad.   The Chef dropped by to ask me how my dining experience was.  I frankly asked about the rice...was it basmati rice? He said yes.  He explained in a nerdy hipster narrative that he knew the butcher who the killed the animals and the farmer who grew the veggies.  His lifestyle and how he was injecting ether to the restaurant scene in Phoenix.  That is why I am giving the guy a break.  So instead of giving him a 2.  I will give him a 3.  You know what, ill change it to 4 because I'm pmsing.  And like I said, I am biased.  Support the guy.  Its quaint, nicely located in downtown Phoenix.  And he came all the way from to Jamaica to hells kitchen to feed you wholesome, well prepared Jamaican food.   .",

I'm a huge foodie and recommend many establishments to my clients and this one is definately off the list.  I don't care how good your food is but if the service is bad, I will never return.  There are too many great restraunts in the Phoenix area with great service and great food to waste my hard earned money at a place like Bread Fruit.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed in my experience at this restaurant. Now reading some of the reviews I guess it is normal for this place so I also will not be back. I came on a Tuesday evening by myself. I also was asked to sit and wait (I guess they do that to everyone). They wanted me to sit at the bar and I guess I should have in hindsight, or just left but I was interested in the food. Anyway, they sat me at a table that was practically in the kitchen. The restaurant was mostly empty, I think there were 3 other tables occupied. The server didn't care that I was uncomfortable, servers kept swishing by very close to me which was awful, as was the noise from the banging in the kitchen. I mentioned it 3 times and the third time he said \"no worries.\" As I sat there eating and being treated like a second class citizen (at the time I thought it was because I was alone), I got more and more upset because none of the other tables ever filled up. So I guess maybe it's one of their \"rules\" that if you're alone you sit at the worst table in the place. The other thing is they push you to have these mixed rum drinks with your dinner, which I didn't want. I was told they have two wines, both AZ wines. ok.... I chose the white which was ok until it warmed up a little, then it was pretty bad. I had the scallop appetizer which was the only good part of the night. My jerk chicken was in a sweet sauce that wasn't good. All in all it was not just a bad experience, it was insulting and I would not recommend you spend your time or money here.",

    "text": "A friend of ours was looking online for good \"Authentic Jamaican\" restaurants in AZ and was referred to The Breadfruit Grill - he took us there for a friend's birthday hoping to try something good and new.  I don't know if we were expecting a lot out of it due to good reviews [what do these people eat?!], but it was no where near my good expectations.  First of all, we had a reservation and yet they made us wait for about an hour outside in the AZ summer heat, with no water.  Secondly, it's BYOB so we did just that, but when we got there they refused to keep our beer and white wine cool while we were waiting.  It was only when we were finally seated they cooled our wines.  Go figure!  On top of that, they charged us for cooling and corking them.  We were also told over the phone that we could bring our (ice cream) cake, but since we were waiting for about an hour outside, our ice cream cake had already melted almost all the way - there was no consideration for putting it in a tray of ice when we got there and asked.  They finally did when we started eating our entrees.  When we ate the cake, they charged us for plates.  Does this place not get enough customers that they have to charge us for EVERYTHING?!  The food?  Eh -  Food was nothing to rave about... We all got the Jerk Chicken, and about half-way eating it we were all dying from it being OVERWHELMINGLY spicy.  ***Mind you, 90% of people in our party absolutely LOVE spicy food and have tried \"AUTHENTIC\" Jamaican food - we even had a few in our party who have even been to Jamaica and have tried the food from all sorts of spots even aside from the resort.***  They weren't even prompt with our drinks to help us to subdue the intense spices of the chicken, so when I said we were dying our tongues were literally dying.  I know some of us didn't even want to finish our meal.  Not only did it kill our taste buds right off our tongues, it also made us feel like we had dry mouth.  The chicken was extremely dry and overcooked; we all agreed we could make better chicken... Why bother going to this place if you can cook better chicken at home, right?!  The ONLY good thing going for this place was the bread stick that came with the meal and maybe the somewhat quaint atmosphere.  You know, you would also think that with such a big party you'd be treated with respect since we brought them a lot of revenue... Sadly, that was not the case.  It seems like big parties are such a nuisance to them.  Plan on having just a party of 2 people if you plan on dining here with \"good\" service, but that's even a stretch as I have read on some reviews - Good luck to you!  I really wanted to give this place a chance because I always love to try new places, especially when it is local!  BUT--that's an enormous BUT--my first time here was just utterly offensive, obnoxious, disgusting, and disappointing. It's a shame when a big party ALL agrees to never step foot in this place ever again.  Thanks to this place, I have made it a point to look at the low-rating reviews and see if they correlate... I can't trust the \"good\" reviews on anything anymore; take reviews with a grain of salt.  I will let you be the judge of this place, and I hope you don't experience our nightmare with this place, but this is my take on it...  My first experience here is definitely the LAST experience here.  FOUR THUMBS DOWN.",

    "text": "After a campus tour of ASU, my parents and I drove around downtown seeking a spot for lunch.  My mom saw a little sign on the corner that she thought said \"Bread & Fruit.\"  We figured maybe we'd grab sandwiches or something. Then we walked up to find it was actually \"Breadfruit\" - Jamaican cuisine.  Although it is definitely not what we had in mind, we decided to stay.  We were so glad we did!  What a delicious, delightful surprise. We sat outside and the extremely accommodating waiter made sure the umbrellas shaded us from the sun.  I must also note that the restroom was impeccably maintained and super cute as well. I was continuously impressed with the customer service throughout the meal.  I didn't actually look at the beverage selection and tried to order a diet coke when the waiter explained that everything is made fresh on site, so soft drinks are just not possible.  Definitely another unexpected and awesome element of the restaurant.  I had the mango lemonade with crushed mint.  It was divine.  We ordered a variety of appetizers:   - Pan Seared Scallops - The waiter spoke highly of the sea scallops and explained how and where they are shipped from to ensure freshness (I didn't even have to ask for this information, but it was another example of the service and commitment to quality).  I cannot speak highly enough of the scallops - spicy and perfectly seared with some bell pepper and green onion drizzled with oil. - Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls - yummy with a wonderful mango chutney.  You expect savory and get a little sweet instead.  There's only two on the plate so don't expect a huge quantity. - Fresh Baked Patty/Empanadas - we got both the spinach and tilapia.  I would definitely get these again.  The tilapia had a nice little spice to it. - House Tropical Salad - perfect on a hot day.  Cool and refreshing and perfectly paired with any menu item.  Since I've decided to go to ASU, I definitely plan to return.  And BYOB! Awesome, and I plan to keep that in mind. Unfortunately, because I will be a super broke student, this place may be out of my price range sometimes.  The average plate is over $10. But for the service, quality, and commitment to freshness and locality, I think it is definitely worth it.",

Then we were asked by the next person if we had a reservation....finally we made it to the table...we were the only ones there...strange greeting.  Obviously being a rum bar, drink options were very limited.  Interestingly enough no iced tea option...I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant that doesn't have tea.  The sollera was quite tasty, but not quite the same as tea.  Apps were really good...scallops and plantains....would do both of these again.  They will not alter or substitute any of the menu options...tread lightly if you have food allergies!  Entrees were also quite good...pork belly was fantastic!  Pork with polenta was also good...spicy.  Could not get dessert as both options had dairy and gluten.  Overall, food was very good!

    "text": "I was in Phoenix for a conference and found The Breadfruit through a web search. It's just a short walk NW of the convention center. The first night I was there I was amazed at the bar's wall full of rum--more than 100 varieties, but more about that later. The dining area was rather small but I was able to get a table during the week (not the same story on a weekend night; reservations are recommended). The waitstaff had spot-on descriptions of the food and cocktails and was passionate about the fare. The menu had quite a lot of seafood options, from mussels to prawns to the catch of the day (red snapper when I visited). The scallops appetizer was delicious--two large, juicy scallops seasoned to perfection. I was glad I took the waiter's recommendation and ordered the prawns; the curry sauce was creamy with a mild flavor. Since I couldn't decide between that or the jerk, I had to come back a couple nights later to try the free range jerk chicken, which was savory and spicy. Both meals were exceptional, and my only regret was that I wasn't in Phoenix longer to try some other dishes. The meals ranged between $14 and $24. Now, back to the rum bar. The bar staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. During my two visits, I tried several of the cocktails and was not disappointed with any. Each drink was made with fresh ingredients and with a variety of rums. You'll not find Captain Morgan or Bacardi here; rather, rums from the Caribbean and Central America dominate, and they even have a rum from Tennessee with a bit of a bourbon taste. You'll also not find whiskey or vodka, just rum, Red Stripe, and wine. They offer some rum flights at a reasonable price, and it's a great opportunity to try different brands of rum and different ages. The owner and bartenders will tell you anything you want to know about the various rums--I felt like I should have been taking notes. I cannot recommend The Breadfruit highly enough and will definitely return again on my next visit to Phoenix. If you're traveling for a convention, steer away from the chain and concept restaurants at CityScape and try this independently owned authentic taste of Jamaica.",

    "text": "It has been a while since we've tried somewhere new in downtown. In all honesty, it is difficult to try new places when all of the new places are only open for lunch and I don't get home until 4pm. That is why we were pleased to see a new place, right down the street, opening up and actually staying open until 8.  The Breadfruit is the work of Dwayne Allen. As far as I can tell, he is a nobody in the restaurant scene which is a nice change of pace for some of the places that are going in downtown. The space is quite inviting. Small open lofty area for dining with seating for about 24 people inside. Bright green walls and faux-brick interior brightened the area up and contrasted the exposed ducts. I felt like I was at home. There were two tables set up outside as well providing an inviting option in the cooler months but the local foot traffic was a little sketch.  The menu is different. There are words that you recognize surrounded by words that you don't making ordering a bit difficult. Most likely, you will go with the word you know and order based on that. My party seemed to have done just that.  After a lengthy wait to place and receive our order, our table was full of food.  Plantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney - this overpriced appetizer was a terrible mess of mushy vegetables warmed inside a pastry and layered with mashed mandarin oranges. The group enjoyed; I was less than impressed and greatly disgusted at the contrast of hot and cold on the plate.  Escovitch Fish and Festival - Friend got this. She seemed to enjoy it, not finding it to be nearly as spicy as it was made out to seem. The fish seemed like it was cooked well and the escovitch sause was excellent.  Brown Stew Chicken - Friend got this. He seemed to find it to be skimpy. Compared to some of the other dishes, the meat was significantly less existent. There were also some bones in the chicken.  Jerk Shrimp - Wife got this. She thought it was good but was suffering from the spice. She is not one to eat spicy food and this was too hot for her. The shrimp were cooked well and had a bit of crisp to them. Also, the tails were removed which earned them big bonus points in my book.  Jerk Chicken off the Grill - Mine. If ever a dam breaks and floods downtown Phoenix, I know that we will be safe. The chicken at Zoe's Cafe and The Breadfruit will save our home by absorbing the water. I couldn't imagine drier chicken than at Zoe's before last night but the jerk flavoring added to the bone dry chicken was the perfect storm to absorb any liquid from my body. Terrible, simply terrible. Realizing that the chicken wasn't spicy at all by my standards, I ordered up some more of that escovitch sauce and drenched by chicken in it whereby making it palatable. The chicken was surrounded by an over cooked pineapple slice that was hard and dry, a tiny piece of corn that had such small kernels on it that I actually had to use a knife to cut them off (something I hate). There was also a pile of ital coleslaw which was a combination of sticks and rubbish that traditionally makes it into the bin at most restaurants. Hard times call for desperate measures.  Drinks did include a wonderful selection of \"Jamaican soda\". The ginger beer was great but very sugary. My wife tells me that the pineapple soda was a little strong and could have been a bit subdued. She also complained of the sugaryness of the sodas.  In all, Breadfruit is a welcome addition to the downtown neighborhood. I was not surrounded by dirty hippies with dreadlocks and the owners were good people. I would recommend that people try it once but I would never suggest it as a place to go for dinner.  Also, keep in mind that the owner will harass you if you leave even slightly negative reviews of his place on Yelp.",

This place is obviously very proud of their product, so if you are expecting food variations/manipulation - you should go to Applebee's. Their food & beverage preparation is a craft and should be experienced as presented.   Their jerk chicken was out of this world... An explosion of taste. It is prepared with rice and veggies... I like my food spicy and it didn't disappoint.  This is a must for special occasions. Small, intimate and very clean! Yes, the price points are high. You get what you pay for in ambiance, quality and experience. Too often, Phoenix residents fail to realize that we are one of the cheapest \"big\" cities in the nation. This place is worth the experience and it separates itself from the norm in Downtown Phoenix.",

I'm not a rum drinker, but fortunately they have plenty of non-rum drinks.  I started with \"Devil in a Blue Dress\" which was neither sweet nor bitter. Not my favorite drink but not for lack of skill on the bartender's part. I moved on to \"Kiwi Reserve\" which was much more my style ( and did have Mt. Gay as one of the ingredients)  Rum Bar is VERY classy and low key and the bartenders are True mixologists with knowledge on par with a chemist. They know their shit and they take their craft seriously which is apparent in every stage of the drink preparation.  This is a nice relaxing place to come relax and in casual, yet sophisticated environment and I can't wait to come back.  Highly recommend.",

We had the plantains and mango chutney for an appetizer,  the red snapper in banana leaves and jet pork for entrees.  Christian made excellent drink suggestions to pair with the entrees.

First, we were \"greeted\" by a pretentious host, who tried so hard to make it seem as this place was the most chic and expensive restaurant in New York City! Haha NOPE!!  We asked to be seated on the front patio since it was empty and it was super nice out. He quickly responded in a condescending way \" No, patio is ONLY reserved for dining\" \"are you dining?\" I was already over this place at this point.    Once the host decided enough time had passed he came and took us to the back patio, which is the smokers section... We were not smoking, we wanted to have a few drinks in a Non-smoking section... But I guess here you don't get the option. Anyway, it worked out after all since the place was empty.   The host back here was nice and he did an ok job, but we asked to get a few drinks and an appetizer and we were told \"We are not allowed to serve food back here\" I was already over the pretentious attitude of this place and now I was over all the \"Rules\" they had. We order 4 drinks (all the same) and they only brought 3!  lol! I mean this place was EMPTY!! How can you forget 1 drink out of 4?!   The drinks were Meh!, the pretentious service was Meh! And the tacky uncomfortable patio set was Meh! This could be an amazing place if they would only stop pretending this is fine dining, get rid of your host upfront and all your rules. Focus on making people comfortable and welcomed so they want to come back!  I will NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! so please don't waste your precious time and money. We drank our meh! Drinks payed our bill and took our party to Bliss Rebar, now this place was amazing. Drinks were great, food is great and the service is frendly and welcoming! Boom!! That's what you want as a review!",

    "text": "Breadfruit and Rum Bar is one of my favorite restaurants/bars in downtown Phoenix. Their food is always great, I can't find food like it anywhere else in the Valley. I strongly recommend to have the scallops; best scallops I've had. Before coming to Rum Bar, thought I didn't like rum, but the bartenders helped me realize that rum is much more complex than just Bacardi. I've been regularly coming to Breadfruit and Rum Bar for about 2 months now, and they never disappoint.",

    "text": "This must be an up-and-coming section of Phoenix.  The restaurant is a little hard to spot ... thank goodness for GPS.  We found a free parking spot a block away.  Very attractive dark wood interior.  The main dining room is a little noisy when busy but that's to be expected.  Friendly servers.  We had the Hemingway daiquiri's and they were delicious!  Hubby tried the \"fine Arizona wine\" - I recommend you skip that and stick to the rum drinks.  Our food came out very quickly.  He enjoyed his jerk pork with polenta.  After a week of eating stadium food at various sports venues, I found the mixed greens salad with jerk prawns really hit the spot.  We were able to walk from there to Symphony Hall (a few blocks).  THIS IS A NOTE TO THE SERVICE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL (I don't want to downgrade this particular restaurant):  I really cannot stand to look at people with things hanging out of their nose ... some kind of ring or something.  It looks like they forgot to wipe away their snot.  If the waitress thought I was rude because I never looked at her while she was talking to us, that is why.  I'm sure this is some kind of self-expression trend but I think it's disgusting.  If you don't want to drive away customers, don't hire people like that ... or insist they take it out for work.",

We wished to order appetizers and drinks while we waited but were told we would not be able to be seated until the arrived.  Instead we opted to sit at the bar and have a drink however the management thought that was not acceptable as well and demanded we wait outside.  All of this occurred as the restaurant lay empty at 6:45 pm on a Saturday night.  After reading other reviews this seems to be a common theme for Breadfruit.  I wont be coming back.  I pray ownership takes notice of this trend and remedies the problem before they close their doors.",

The place was busy but wasn't crowded however by 7:30-8 every table was pretty much full...glad we made our reservations. Our waitress Grace was kind and gave great options for drinks and entrees. I had the Shim Sham drink at the beginning and my husband and I ordered two of the avocado and plantain rolls for appetizers...so yum! For the entree we both ordered the jerk chicken with rice and veggies and that too was great.  The place is worth a visit. Although it's small, it has a great vibe to it. My advice, make reservations, grab some drinks and sit back and enjoy your company.  Everybody around us seemed happy, we had a great experience so I know we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I appreciate the owner for taking a gamble on downtown Phoenix and opening in a city where charm is as rare as good drivers. The entrees are generally tasty and reasonably priced. For example, I have thoroughly enjoyed my jerk chicken both times that I have dined here. Similarly, my dining partners have found their prawns and beef stew satisfactory.  The intimate dining room with exposed brick lends a casual and laid-back atmosphere. Service is attentive. Water glasses are always kept full and waitresses are very knowledgeable about the small menu.  So why did I not provide a fourth star? Two words: dessert disaster. I ordered the $5 sweet potato pudding dessert and was presented with a slice of pudding that was about as wide and tall as two of my fingers (and I'm not a giant...) Perhaps I could forgive the size if it were especially decadent, but it was dry and not especially flavorful. Paying $5 for a mediocre sliver of sweet potato pudding hurt me in the \"value\" department; especially considering that my large entree itself was under $10.  In general, this restaurant has a lot going for it. However, the food seems to be the issue that is leading most reviewers (myself included) to not rate it as highly as we would hope we could. If the owner is reading this review, I suggest he or she consider making some minor revisions to the menu. A restaurant cannot survive if it is only respected for its charming building or \"place.\" The quality and value of the food must equal the surroundings in its ability to satisfy customers.",

    "text": "The strongest statement about The Breadfruit can be made be its owner/chef:  He doesn't have any restaurant experience; he's just making the traditional Jamaican recipes of his grandmother.  And it works.  I took my two vegan friends to The Breadfruit on a weeknight and the small restaurant was about half-full.  There are two IKEA tables with chairs in the grass in front of the restaurant for al fresco dining.  As we waited for the delicious Avocado and Plantain Spring Rolls ($6.75), we had plenty to talk about with our drink orders: Hibiscus-infused Tea ($3.50) and the Carrot Juice ($3.50).  Pricing seems steep, but in all fairness, these were beverages worth every penny.  The Breadfruit is BYOB ($5/wine, $5/six-pack, or $1/beer bottle corkage fee), but I had forgotten this drunken little detail.   We asked if there were more vegan options than the two clearly marked entrees, and he confirmed that most of the starters/sides were vegan, too.  (Warning: the spinach patty contains beef broth in the crust.  Our server returned from the kitchen to let us know.)  We decided to share everything.  The Tofu Curry ($9.75) is a nice, complete meal served with Rice & Peas (beans), steamed cabbage and bell pepper, and a side of baked plantains.  The Breadfruit has also added a new item, Pop Cho and Pickled Ginger ($9.75), a sautee of bok choy, onions, and rice wine vinegar, which is served with a memorable Jamaican sweet potato mash.  The side of grilled corn ($2) was juicy and sweet, with no dead kernels.  The festivals is not your everyday bread stick, and the subtle sweetness had us wondering if vanilla is the only sweetening agent.  During the meal, we all noted the teeny-tiny sink in the more than ample bathroom.  The primary color walls are juxtaposed nicely against exposed brick, and the kitchen is open and you can see the duo chefs preparing the food.  The service was prompt and courteous.  For dessert, we shared the delectable Sweet Potato Pudd'n ($5.50), which is acompact wedge of sweet potato, ginger, nutmeg, and raisins, baked with coconut flakes on top.  Perhaps it's a bit dry for some tastes, but we found it most enough, and we battled with forks for the last bite.  At this point, one of the chefs came out and asked with a bright warm smile if we were the vegan table.  She herself, she said, was a vegan.  She mentioned that the Sweet Potato Pudd'n was the giveaway The Breadfruit had at the recent West of Western Culinary Festival held at the Phoenix Art Museum.  Her visit was like a second dessert; it's always so nice to so the excitement of the chef who has just prepared your food.  The Breadfruit is a strong addition to the downtown culinary scene, now bustling on that corner of 1st and Pierce with PastaBAR, Sens, and The Turf Accountant.",

Love the swanky hole in the wall that Phoenix seems to have a niche in. Our server was very nice and the drinks were great...but now the disappointment begins...Appleton Rum Sea Scallops app was pretty good, couls have used more flavor but what's awful was there were only 2 and our food took forever!. Not worth it.They should definitely change this into a main dish add scallops, more seasoning & rice, and increase the price to make it worth it. I ordered the pork with polenta and it was boring! My friend ordered something else.. dont remember what but she wasn't thrilled either. So I recommend this place maybe for a Happy Hour but for dinner's there is better out there. If you're looking for Carribean food downtown.. I suggest Ticoz.",

It was a 3 hour wait for an indoor table, we agreed to just sit outside, and lo and behold we ended up with a little table indoors. No wait. The service was absolutely fantastic! My partner is a serious water drinker and his glass was always full. The food came out promptly. The servers were kind, but not pushy or rushed. The food was outstanding. The drinks were amazing. It is by far the best place I have eaten at in Phoenix - especially for the price.  2. Second time was a quiet weekday. I sent two friends to the bar since I would arrive later. The two really enjoyed their drinks. Then we had dinner. The food, once again, was outstanding. The service, this time, was not so great. When I arrived she never came over to offer me a drink - I had to finally go get her. Then we had to hunt her down again to get menus. She then left us for 30 minutes before being flagged again to take our order. Later, brought our food but didn't provide silverware. She was completely inattentive. She never offered additional beverages. And then we had to ask twice for the bill. And again for her to run our cards. The bar only has 8 seats, how could she stand there the entire night and be so unobservant of customer needs?   I still give it 5 stars. Overall, the food and drinks are amazing. When they are busy the table staff are excellent. Just watch out for the one lousy bartender...",

    "text": "This restaurant is too cute.  A cozy dining room than can fit maybe 24 people, and a small adjacent wooden rum bar.  The food is excellent too.  There are only a few appetizers and entrees on the menu, but what they do they do well.  Just beware that when they say an item is spicy, they mean it!  The roasted plantains with mango chutney were a delicious beginning to our meal.  I loved my pork belly with guava glaze, served over mashed butter beans that were spiked with Jamaican spices.  My friend raved about the prawns simmered in curry and Red Stripe beer.  Another friend ordered the jerk-spiced pulled pork.  I warned him that it would be spicy (and I know he is not a huge fan of spicy food).  When he didn't finish his meal, the item mysteriously failed to appear on the bill! (Was it an omission, or did the server realize my friend didn't like it?)  Anyway, that's not to say the dish wasn't good, I think it was just a little too spicy for him.  We decided not to have dessert here, and instead went to the art walk on Roosevelt St.  The Breadfruit is a little hard to find and there's only street parking, but if you're downtown be sure to give it a try.",

    "text": "Holy f-ing hotness. I literally watched my date's eyes tear up and stream down his face repeatedly, in unison with mine. See, after we took a trip to Jamaica last year, we foolishly assumed that no transplant restaurant in the middle of Downtown Phoenix could compare to the legitimate heat the actual island's dishes offered. Boy have I never been so wrong.  While The Breadfruit's offerings are quite tasty, I cannot stress enough that this place is not for the faint of heart. After 10 years of living in Phoenix, I add jalapenos and hot sauce to just about every single dish I eat, and the spiciness The Breadfruit threw my way totally kicked my ass. I think we may have gone through 6 pitchers of water over our 90 minute meal. At the end of the night, my date's head was so overheated, he actually felt his ears popping repeatedly. (**Note: Whether that was actually happening or my date was just a pussy, we will never know.)  Anyhow, on to the food. I've been hear several times now and am hooked on the Jerk Chicken Plate and the Jerk Chicken Salad. I've also had the scallop entree which while tasty and this pains me to say, was just too freakin hot for me. The Jerk Chicken is spicy as shit as well, but the mango infused dressing and pineapple bites do a wonderful job of cooling your mouth. I think I only needed 3 pitchers of water my last trip : )  They recently opened up a bar next door called The Rumbar. This is what really excited me about this place. Over 50 brands of authentic Jamaican rum to choose from, with all hand muddled ingredients to throw in. Their mojito is sugary and delicious.   I've also been blessed with excellent service each time I went, however I do have an issue with a particular Duke of The Breadfruit who is a freakin server there. Stop checking in to your work! It's cheating!!!  Next time you need your sinuses cleared out, look no further than The Breadfruit. I'll be the chick with 6 empty water pitchers surrounding her plate.",

We had a reservation and we were greeted, seated and had a waiter at out table within minutes (Saturday night 7:15). It was crowded but they handled it well.  The meal was spectacular. I always look at the accompaniments....and the jerk chicken off the grill came with roasted vegetables and dirty rice. The rice was cooked perfectly...the grains were identifiable and crisp. The veggies were superb...squash, broccoli and parsnips. Crisp and presented well. The chicken was ample and done as well as I've ever had. The BEST PART was the sauce that came with the chicken: I considered asking for a glass of it so I could drink it but I didn't have the nerve.  Besides supporting a local merchant, go there. You'll get a great meal at a very reasonable price.",

    "text": "FYI - this review is based only on the cocktails as I have not yet had the opportunity to eat here.  I went twice this past weekend.  I stopped in for one drink on Friday night with a friend and went back with my wife and some friends on Saturday after dinner to explore more of the cocktail menu.  We tried several drinks on the menu and every cocktail was clearly well crafted and perfected.  The bartender--I think his name is Brian--was very knowledgeable and easy going.  He is a very skilled bartender and you can tell that he really enjoys his craft.  The only criticism I have relates to the server that I had on the first night.  A friend ordered a red stripe, and the server looked disappointed.  My friend asked the server if he shouldn't order the beer, and the server said that he probably wouldn't order a beer in this bar.  Overall, it felt very judgmental.  What the server didn't realize was that my friend was ordering a red stripe to have something to drink while he continued to look over the cocktail menu.  Later on that night, I asked the server about an ingredient in one of the cocktails and he answered confidently.  I later learned from the bartender that the info provided by the server was incorrect.  I feel like a server should really know the cocktails inside and out in a bar like this, ESPECIALLY if he recommends them over a beer.  I debated knocking the review down to 4 stars as a result of this, but those interactions were rather brief and I feel like my overall experience was overwhelming positive and that people should really try this place--at least for the cocktails alone!",

    "text": "The Caribbean food that I'm used to deep fries just about everything... fried plantains, empanadas, etc... loads you up with rice... leaves you feeling like you might develop instant diabetes...   The Breadfruit was the perfect change from that.  The decor is great... I felt transported to somewhere tropical... almost like I could step outside on the beach.  Not in a tacky way.  It was very authentic & made me think of past excursions to the Caribbean.  The patio was cute but small so we opted to stay inside.  Service was everything I expect from waitstaff... our waitress was super attentive & knowledgeable.  I ordered a couple of cocktails from the Rum Bar... which I definitely recommend doing.  Mojito Classic to start the meal because I'm boring... & also Beets The Blues because I couldn't look away from it.  Both were glorious.  We started the meal with Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls... interesting... the mango chutney was the star of that dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Jerk Chicken Salad... I wasn't expecting much from a salad but it was great.   You can tell everything is made with fresh & quality ingredients.  I wish more restaurants were like this.  I had the guava glazed pork belly.  Melt in your mouth pork with a tangy sweet sauce.  If I was a little more tipsy, I probably would have licked my plate.  The mash included on the plate was also delicious...  but I find myself fantasizing over the pork belly.  So.  Good.  All in all, it was great & I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my \"uncouth\" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss...   It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine.   Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat!   While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95).   Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states \"no substitutions or modifications\"... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a \"modification\"?   At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as \"Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body.\"   It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's \"beauty\" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of \"nothing fancy.\"   How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then?   The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams \"pretentious and grandiose\" and tainted our entire experience.   To quote my dinning companion, \"You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!\"",

We didn't have a reservation but went around 5:30.  Early dinners suit us. They seated us outside; tonight was perfect for it.  Around 80 degrees and amazing.  NO chill, just perfect and comfortable.  Rum punch so good! Scallops delicious (we shared them).  I had the lobster, he had the house special, red snapper.  We were both very happy with our meals.  The portions were perfect.  We love experiencing more flavors and high quality food over large portions.  I love leaving a meal not feeling stuffed, but perfect content.  This was that feeling.  All the drinks, which came recommended by our great server, were smooth and oh so good.  (the coconut bread pudding was also very yummy and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside; i wanted a little something like creme fraiche or a small bit of ice cream for it, but it was very good on it's own)  I would certainly return again, but it was definitely a splurge.

I decided on the red strip curried prawns and shim sham as my drink. I was recommend both. It was very affordable as well. The owner stopped by all of the tables which I thought was great. Made you feel very comfortable. They had great Caribbean music playing in the background. The waiter wasn't overbearing, although he did take a little long to pick up my card as we were waiting to leave.

I also think it's fantastic that they're participating in ethical sourcing of their fish (I don't eat fish, for the record, but if I did, I'd be glad to know where it came from, and that's information they can provide).",

    "text": "I really enjoy the food and cocktail there. Cocktails, as long as you like rum order anything from the menu and you are in for a treat. For the food I just love the jerk pork and polenta it has a lovely kick to it the right amount of food. I always feel nicely satisfied never heavy. It is just a unique taste for Phoenix so it makes me happy.  Now... With that said... The experience of going there takes some getting used to. First no matter what ALWAYS make a reservation. They are not busy all the time but they ALWAYS ask you to take a seat and WAIT even if you have reservation. But at least with reservation they don' t tell you it is going to be 20mn even though the restaurant is half empty. So there... You've been warned. Make a reservation, take a seat, it will be worth it.",

I've been in the restaurant industry for years and this is by far one of the strangest experiences I've ever had...  My beautiful bride and I walk in and ask for a table for two when they open. Bartender says do you have reservations? Not one person in the place. Host says next time please try to get reservations. 30 minutes later still the only ones in the restaurant.  One of the waitresses tried to bring something behind the bar, and I actually heard the bartender Yell at her to get it out from behind the bar.   Our server came over to take our order. When my wife ordered the salmon she wanted the sauce on the side. The server said no. I asked why she couldn't have it on the side. She said because there are no substitutions as you can read at the bottom of the menu.   I can honestly say again that I've never experienced anything like this in my life. We will never be going back.",

    "text": "My fiancee and I have visited the rum bar on numerous occasions with various combinations of friends, and recommended it to countless others. Being rum enthusiasts (my fiancee herself is caribbean) we were thrilled when we initially thought was a hidden gem. This place has gone downhill, and we must not be the only ones who think so as it was almost empty tonight. Won't be going back anymore.   The problem, I think, boils down to attitude on the part of the staff, which I'm guessing starts with the ownership. For example, their Tamarind Ball II drink comes with a nice sweet tamarind ball on top as a garnish. My fiancee loves these so when we went tonight we asked if we could have a second on the cocktail. The waitress said sure and it would be a $1. No problem. The bartender, across the room, starts violently shaking his head NO! He informs us (still across the room) that these things take 9 hours (!!!!111!!!1) to make and that we could not have any extra. We were literally the only people in the room an hour before close. Not to mention you can get a bag of tamarind ball (candy essentially) for $3 at food city. Just sloppy customer service. The bartender seemed to take great pleasure in saying no.    On top of that, being regulars, we've seen the cocktail menu change a few times and we have some favorites of old times. Not only do we know their names but we know their ingredients. Tonight we tried to order an older drink, and were informed that if its not on the menu, they won't make it. Plenty of other bars reward (and even admire) their regulars for their loyalty and enjoy the nostalgia of older drinks. Here, I'm guessing the bartender was just too green judging by how much time the owner spent correcting him.   To finish it off, I must mention the owner. He gets a lot of credibility around Phoenix as a rum guy and I've always admired him for being an ambassador of the spirit. If you've ever seen him at an event though or had the misfortune of being sat by him at the rum bar you'd know he's got quite an air of superiority about him. Tonight he sat at the bar, feet from us and heard us complain. Again we were the only table (a 5 top) for over an hour on a Thursday night. He said not a word to us. Never asked after the food or the drinks. Never thanked us for coming in. Never offered to explain any of the menu or the options. He just sat at the bar, until a minute to close when he quickly gathered his things and left the place.  I imagine the staff dislikes being here as much as I do, so I don't fault them for this. I do fault the owner though. Rum deserves better. Caribbean food deserves better. Phoenix deserves better.",

    "text": "Let me tell ya, Breadfuit has really got my goat.   No, really...they offer a local Mountain Goat dish on their menu.  Offering meats and produce from local (or at least from sustainable) farms, this snug retreat has you loungin' you in da island, mon.  Arriving in a sand-colored, seemingly residential area, I was surprised to see the glowing \"RUM\" sign.  Eureka - I was in the right place.  Nautical ropes lead you to the front door, opening on the lounge area and impressive rum collection (over 100 varieties, in fact!). Cozying up in the corner to get a good shot for you lovely Yelpers, and someone (possibly staff?) proceeded to ignore my positioning and squashed me between the door and the brick wall.   - eiy.  After I got over my self-importance, I complimented the rum punch bowl and followed our waiter, Ryan, to our table-pour-duo.  At 8pm on a Wednesday night, we were two of five people in the joint (which is good, because it's a pretty small space).  Setting to the menu, I had to hold back my surprise (the prices before me were a bit higher than the online menu).  Nonetheless, I knew what my order was destined to be: the Blue Mountain Curried Goat (with farm veg, Blue Mountain curry marinade, and basmati rice $22).  When do you get that opportunity in New England??!  The dish was flavorful (sweet and spicy and plate-licking GOOD!) and plentiful....but I doubt that you'd be able to resist the temptation to scoop up every last bite.  Not into goat?  How about Rum? - The cocktail menu is just how I like it: in courses!  Each concoction offers freshly squeezed juices, tonic made in-house (like...soda stream?), aaaaand massive blocks of ice (sucks up a lot of space in the glass, but at least you don't have to worry about ice chip avalanche when you're going for the last drops of your bev).  The  Fifth & Company : a ginger brew + raspberry + bergamot essence + Mt. Gay Eclipse rum ($10).  Off the cuff, I was unimpressed (10$ for *maybe* 6oz of cocktail??  That's steep, even for Boston standards).  But sipped over the course of the evening, I found it to be a pleasant surprise of a beverage.  Sweet / tangy / zippy sips - totally worth it.  Full from the goat, I almost passed up on dessert (thank goodness my dining partner talked me out of THAT mistake).  We ordered the Jamaican puddin' pie (NO 'G'!) with rum-infused whipped cream.  It was a small sliver of a slice, but the custard-like pie was sweet and filling (can I take a tub of that whip to go?).  All in all, a great dinner (albeit, a pricey one - about $90 for two) with an excellent cocktail.  The lounge space is large enough to prevent crowding, yet small enough to create that warm intimate feel that warms you right up.  A great choice for a private party, or a relaxed semi-casual first date - - - if you can find the place.  Order up the Mollasses Fried Lollipops (chicken lollies?!) and let me know how they are!",

We decided to eat there about a week-and-a-half ago.. when we arrived it was about an hour prior to closing. There were 3 tables open on the patio. When we asked about sitting on the patio, the host literally grimaced! Then explained that \"there wasn't seating for two\" on the patio.  An hour before you close?? Multiple tables open outside??? On a THURSDAY NIGHT?? Really?  So, rather than dignifying the hosts response with an \"oh okay\" I said, \"Thanks. We'll check back.\" (then finished that sentence to my gf with \"when hell freezes over.\"   So,  We actually walked right around the corner to Pomo Pizzeria and were served a world-class meal, had an awesome server, were greeted by the chef himself because he brought us a complimentary dessert..  ALL without ever hearing a word about how the Breadfruit employ treated us earlier.   Last,  we drove past the Breadfruit on our way and saw that the 3 open tables were now 4.

We say \"no\" and they ask us to wait to be seated, even though the whole place was practically empty.   Then we get the menu and order Mojitos. The mojitos were small for $10, but they had real spearmint (good, because the tap water tasted bad, so I used it for my water....which trust me you will need with the food).  Then we try to order, but 5 jerk options were unavailable and one pork chop option was replaced with Quail. So we go for the scallops appetizer, the shredded pork jerk and the coconut curry.  We asked for some bread while we waited, they do a garlic bread appetizer (not good). The wait bothered my date a little, because they served the people who walked in after us right away. I didn't like that it was super freezing inside and really loud so I couldn't hear the waiter (bad acoustics). We managed to have some loud but good conversation over mojitos and convinced them to light our tea light for warmth/comic relief.  They play a lot of Bob Marley to make up for the bad acoustics, otherwise we would definitely hear word for word everything being said.   Eventually food came. It was presented really well, but not easy to eat. The scallops caused a histamine reaction right away for me (not sure if it was the sauce...maybe liquid smoke...I'm not allergic to sea food). They serve a really cute palate cleanse in-between courses.   I had trouble with the curry dish items, cabbage didn't lend itself to be cut, or as finger food. The tofu was a change of pace, sauce was mild, rice super bland, and tiny bit of candied plantain were super good.  I tried my date's sweet potato side and that was pretty mellow. But my date got an upset stomach later, had some pepto bismouth and his tongue turned scary black from the reaction of all the charcoal in the food and the bismouth.  (In response to comments on this post, we are aware Bismouth can cause this reaction alone, but it had not happened before.The goal is to not need Pepto Bismouth after dinner.)  We had a nice time anyway; that's how we roll. But it was $80 for both of us with tip and it just didn't seem worth it. ---It's like they're trying to be something in L.A. or NYC. (No SF restaurant would act so pompous about seating.) Although I did appreciate the local sourced food. Their deserts sounded fantastic so if I go back it will just be for desert.",

We decided to wait the 30 minutes for a table because they said the food was that good even though the Yelp ranking was a little low.  The waitress and a sidekick with a mustache that reminded me of Salvador Dali's arrived at the table. They had that aura about them that made my dining experience entertaining  and brings a smile to my face every time I think about their performance.  My entree was the three stripe shrimp, and it was spicy and full of what I would expect to find in a flavorful Jamaican dish. I also tasted all of the entrees at my table and found none lacking. My table also ordered the two desserts that were offered by the waitstaff duo, a breadfruit and a chocolate Creme brulee. Both were very good and worth any health risks from sugar or caloric waste.  Tasting all the drinks at my table, my favorites were the pina colada and the ginger infused rum drink. My lovely waitress suggested that the pina colada would be the best that I have ever tasted, and yes, it ranks up there particularly since the trips to the rum factory in the Caribbean are a little hazy to recall.  So, a solid 4 star food and drink experience, but the outstanding performance of sophistication from the waitstaff takes this to a 5 star standout.",

    "text": "I have been here twice with my girlfriend for various celebrations. The first time, Isaac took care of us. He did it so well that on our next visit we had to request him, and THAT is where he really wowed us. His extensive knowledge on the food and drinks were amazing. He was able to give us extremely detailed descriptions of the flavors of a few dishes and drinks we were torn between in order to help us make a decision. From that whole dinner, the True standout was a pan-seared steelhead salmon with a tamarind reduction. The salmon was very juicy and moist, but perfectly crispy around the edges. I was curious as to how the typically potent tamarind flavor would fit with the salmon. I don't know how they did it, but the dish was out-freaking-standing. We were also curious to learn more about the whole restaurant concept and Isaac was  able to tell us a lot about the history of the place and the ethical/sustainable sourcing of their ingredients. On the second time we were there, he was with a trainee, who was almost as friendly and knowledgeable. While Isaac is officially our favorite, I have no doubt this place hires only the best of the best in order to provide quality, sustainable, delicious food with top-notch friendliness and service.",

Save your time and money, there is no Jamaican here - and no breadfruit, beef patties, ackee and salt fish, brown stew chicken, D and G soda or any other staple of the island.  The price point is completely off the wall - and service is pretentious at best and the vibe is hypster with a Bob Marley soundtrack thrown in for good measure....",

We had three drinks and they were all excellent my favorite was probably the punch which was just all orange bitters, orange juice and rum. Bitbit changes every day so ask first.  Another excellent drink was the Sugarfoot. A little bit sweet but great as a second drink. And then we looked at the other reviews and got the rum old fashioned. Stronger and to the point. Got the baked plantains which come with mango chutney and cinnamon.. Highly recommend them The service was just great. Our server Isaac was friendly and fun to talk with.

    "text": "This is a review of the bar only - I'll review the food another time. The thing is, the bar is the star here. We return to this little gem again and again because the craft cocktails are hands-down, the BEST in Phoenix.  Every drink on the menu is hand crafted with the utmost gourmet style and fresh, house-made, impeccably-sourced ingredients.   The bar staff is faultlessly trained and knowledgeable, not to mention friendly and welcoming. If you're lucky, you'll get to witness a training session; the owner imparts the history of rum from all over the world to his team. He knows every nuance, from how they are made and aged, to how to pair them in ways your palate has never experienced.   It's a flavor adventure no matter what you order, but try the Rum Old Fashioned. It's the best we've ever had. Honorable mention to the pina colada; it's absolutely outstanding... not too sweet like most others you've had, and the real coconut, both in the mix, and as a garnish, makes it transcendent.   On a cool evening, try the from-scratch hot buttered rum. It's so rich, luscious and complex, you'll be transported to an island paradise.",

Those reviews couldn't have been further from the truth. We experienced incredibly amazing service. EVERYONE was attentive and pitched in to make sure empty plates were removed in a timely manner, water glasses were filled appropriately. Margaret our server was very sweet, attentive, professional, unobtrusive but made sure we had everything we needed and oh, was she ever so familiar with all the dishes and cocktails offered and offered in depth and spot on descriptors to everything we asked her about. Unfortunately, we found out it was her last night. Sad to see her leave :( The food was amazing. Delicious, well presented, with just the right amount of heat to make you feel you were in Jamaica and the music added to the ambiance. We got to meet Dwayne and Chef Danielle and extended our appreciation and thanks for a memorable dining experience. The only drawback is because they are in the downtown area, parking is not very convenient. Other than that, 2 thumbs up for sure. We will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "I made reservations here for my birthday for a party of 6 on a Monday for the patio. My party and I show up and the host seems like he can barely force a smile out. He indicates our table is set up inside to which I reply I had made a reservation for the patio. I am still incredulous at his response when he says that can't be accommodated because they didn't know. This is their oversight and not even the slightest notion to correct this! All the meanwhile, the patio (and restaurant in general) have a total of 2 tables!!! Wow.   My friends can see I am a bit shocked and bummed so they chime in that it is my birthday and can't something be done to accommodate us on this special occasion? Nope. Literally got a sneer from the host in response. So our only option is to accept this table inside where the smell of old seafood seems to linger. Oh and I forgot to mention that we were missing one person so our party couldn't be seated right away. Remember, there are only 2 other tables occupied and NO wait!! Again, wow.  So we sidle up to the empty bar to wait and the bartender who actually seems very friendly offers us the drink special for the evening. One of my friends asks to sample this and our bartender extremely hesitantly pours her a sip. I do not blame him for this hesitation since I am sure management influenced this with the less than accommodating environment they foster. At this point, we haven't even been sat and it is a dining experience from my worst dreams, albeit on the day I want to celebrate with my close friends. I call it a wrap and we bounce out of there and celebrate at Cibo instead.   Give me a break Breadfruit. Not even Michelin star restaurants feel like they have the posterity to treat their customers this way. I will not return and will certainly discourage people from dining at your establishment.",

Our bartender explained the different cocktails on the menu, which were separated by course, with a whole section dedicated to classics like mojitos and daiquiris.  I ordered the Kingston 5 and the Velvet and Vinyl. The first drink made me feel like I was on a beach somewhere in the Carribean. The second drink had many layers to it, and I could taste distinct flavor of hibiscus in the thick drink. Both drinks used the finest rum I've ever tasted. I even told my husband, \"Man, we need to stop buying cheap rum and buy the good stuff!\" That's how much of a difference it made. We could've stopped at cocktails but ended up ordering two small plates, the scallops and the shrimp. Both plates tasted absolutely delicious, but will say they were definitely on the smaller portion side, especially for the price. Overall can't wait to come back here for another Date Night!",

    "text": "Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya.. Bermuda, Bahama   If you want any type of rum from any of the above, cmon on pretty mama.. You DON'T have to go to Kokomo.. BUT, if you or you're AmX is really pretty, there is a 50 year old Appleton Estate Rum for $2500 per. Now, if your pocket book isn't feeling oh-so Hemingway, The Breadfruit claims to have the most extensive Rum menu in all of Arizona.. and after seeing it for myself, I happen to believe this claim. The drinks here are all worthy starting as described by our attentive waiter as 'fruit forward' to more 'heavy and serious' and after dinner as the drink menu follows on. The bartenders at The Breadfruit have a romance with rum, which is regarded as the most versatile spirit. There is a Rum Punch of the day. The evening we were there, it was a light, fruity, rum concoction of hibiscus and roasted smoked pineapple. The punch carried PUNCH. Do not come expecting a full wine list here, as there are only two from Southern Arizona. This is a Rum Bar. Be prepared to take an Uber. :-) The next drink I had for dinner, in lieu of wine, was a Velvet and Vinyl. This drink was almost too pretty to drink! The waiter delivered this deep pink to red libation to my table in a beautiful little glass, don't be fooled by its beauty. On first sip, I decided to do just that: sip it. The Velvet and Vinyl is a beauty of Appleton Estate VX Rum, hibiscus liquor, (which is house made!), ginger, pineapple, lime, bitters and a touch of rose mist. If you are the DD on your night here, don't worry, there are nice libations that carry sans alcohol for you too!   Key Largo, baby why don't we go to Kokomo?   Speaking of Kokomo. If you have ever been in the Florida Keys and had a corn fritter than you will appreciate some of Breadfruits appetizers. We noshed on the delicious Salt Fish Fritter. It was a flat fritter of cod fish served with a creme fraiche of dill and coconut. There are two served warm on a plate and a good way to offset some of that rum before dinner.   Montego.. why don't we go, Jamaica.   Jamaican Jerk..  The Breadfruit and Rum Bar has that too. For dinner, I had the Jerk Pork and Polenta: a slowly smoked pork shoulder that had been marinated in rum, (what else?), jerk rub and smoked over pimento woods and served over tasty warm polenta and seasonal farm vegetables. The pork is more of a pulled type dish over the polenta. My date, my husband, also wanted to relive our vacation to the Caribbean with some tastes of jerk and rum and opted for the Pimento Wood Jerk Chicken, which was a HUGE serving of game hen smoked over pimento wood, rubbed with house jerk rub and served over rice and small peas. This dish had some spice to it! It comes as a hen on a bone and was amazing! The table of us being 6 had various plates that included the Blue Mountain Curried Goat over Basmati Rice and it was said to be yummy and tender and looked like a generous portion. The Guava Glazed Pork Belly was also ordered on our table and there were about 5-6 slices of the Pork Belly two being super fatty with not much meat, which can happen with pork belly and one reason, I personally don't order it. Our friends ordered a dessert to share and for $9 it was a super small ramekin of dessert which is a little on the pricey side to me. Whereas, I felt the rest of the menu was on point for pricing. The menu is ever changing and uses local farms and sources such as Mayas Farms, 2 Wash Ranch, Pillsbury Wines and The Meat Shop , JUST to name a few.   A couple of things to know. The Breadfruit and Rum Bar is small. Make a reservation if you are having dinner. We had a party of 6 for our monthly little dinner club and were asked to secure with a credit card. They will confirm on the day of the reservation and I like that. There was a mix up with our reservation when we arrived despite the confirmation via telephone earlier in the day for what was to be a half and hour later than was logged into the reservation system when we arrived, SO I am glad we decided to arrive early for a drink! There was also some confusion over wanting a drink at the bar and the girl wanting to take us out to the cigar area patio out back. It all worked out and I didn't care either way because we ended up loving our waiter who carried us through the first drink to the last drink after our dinner was served. Parking is somewhat a bear in this area, also. Allow time for that! The patio, should you want to sit out there for the Cigar and Rum Manifest, ( a separate menu all its own!), has patio heaters for the winter and is expansive.   Our service , (from order to getting entrees) , was slow but my husband and I don't mind that after having lived in France and knowing that food is what makes social times the best ! The wait staff made up for the slowness ten fold anyway.   Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo...  (Well, at least if you order that Appleton Estate Vintage, you will :) ) ...",

I had the jerk chicken and the vegetable medley. The jerk chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection with the right amount of heat. The rum punch was great and the servers were kind. My only complaint would be the pricing compared to the portion size. Not sure if this could be the best option price wise when looking to satisfy your jerk craving, but its will be an option you wouldnt regret.",

    "text": "Ahhhh Breadfruit....where do I begin? With your delicious cocktails? Your fun and happenin atmosphere? I wish that's where this review was going, but alas, I left your establishment with a bad taste in my mouth....  Let me begin by saying this was a solid 3 stars (maybe even 3.5?) before I got my bill. The \"special fish\" sounded great, and after Craig went on and on about how they have their own fish monger, and how the fish is flown in daily, and yadda yadda yadda, how could I resist? The fish was good, the portion was ridiculously small, and the accoutrement were completely forgettable. So riddle me this: How is it, that on a menu where no item is more than 14 bucks (all items very well priced by the way) that the \"special fish\" is f-ing 25 dollars??? I mean, if you have a special that is more than twice most of the entree's on your menu, you best inform the customer. I was not pleased to receive my bill and discover that little surprise on the check. Seriously, had the fish been priced closer to the rest of the entree's, the anger I am spewing currently would be much less vitriolic.   Additionally, the accoutrement: grilled pineapple (ok, I get it, it's sweet), deep fried bread (WTF? you could lash these bastards together and float back to Jamaica on 'em), and coleslaw that is obviously meant as a garnish and not to be eaten. Give me a freakin break.   The red beans and rice were whatever, my wife's jerk chicken was dry and NEEDED that chutney to be at all edible, and the meal itself was completely forgettable. Tack on the not-so-great souffle that Craig talked us into, and the more I've thought about my dining experience at Breadfruit, the more pissed off I am I'm 80 bucks lighter (2 entrees, 2 drinks, desert, and tip). Sure, sure, it was my fault for ordering all that, but c'mon man, I mean, really?   I will return to this fun and drinkably tasty locale again for perhaps appetizers and drinks (most definitely the drinks) and the atmosphere when I'm in the downtown area, but I will here-for-to pass on further dining experiences.",

    "text": "This place was amazing!  My friends and I started a dinner club and this was the pick for our inaugural meeting.  (I will refer to my friends as J and S.)    We sat outside on the patio and I recommend that if you visit when it's not too hot.  I ordered the Tofu Curry with Jasmine Rice and Plantain.  It was amazing! I usually don't like coconut curry but this was very good.  I will definitely order it again.  J ordered the Jerk Shrimp with pineapple, corn and breadstick.  We had read that the jerk seasoning is very hot and we were warned!  Inferno is a good way to describe it.  I LOVE hot food so I didn't mind it at all when I tried it. J paired the shrimp with the pineapple and found that it toned down the spicy to a manageable level and was a \"delightful combination\".  I tried a bit of the breadstick and it was a sweet bread which was great to balance out the spiciness of the jerk shrimp.  S ordered the Molasses chicken lollipops with red potatoes.  When her order arrived we all agreed that \"lollipops\" was an excellent description because the dish looked exactly like we expected.  I asked S for her opinion and she said \"the meat was good and the molasses added a nice sweet flavor that went with the name lollipop but was borderline overpowering. The potatoes were good as were the vegetables but I could have used more than 3 veggies on the plate.\"    We all ordered the rum punch which is different every time.  This night it was a raspberry pink blend.  I enjoyed it so much I had two!  We were warned that the portion sizes are smaller than other places.  The prices are higher than other places in the area but I believe that you get what you pay for.  I think that the quality of the food justified the prices.    Our waitress Margaret hit the sweet spot between being attentive without hovering.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave good recommendations.",

As the name implies, they only serve rum based drinks, but the amount of thought that goes into every ingredient they add really makes them all shine. Speaking of rum, if you're used to Malibu, captain Morgan's, and Bacardi, you're going to be surprised that there's a whole other world of amazing rums not like anything you find in a typical grocery store. If you don't like rum you haven't been to rum bar. The food is also really tasty. Most of it is pretty carb heavy but I'll break my diet to come here. The jerk chicken is spicy and flavorful, and if you're looking to splurge the lobster is excellent. I try to come here at least once a week.",

Sadly the best part of our experience and meal was the drink which turns this review into a 2-star instead of 1.   Even with a half-empty dining room at 8pm on a weekday, we were told they did not have a table available and had to wait half an hour, at which point we were escorted into the now near-empty dining room.   Our appetizers and entrees were bland, with only hints of Jamaican flavors, and served luke-warm.  Hubby had a upset stomach and touch of queasiness a couple hours after dinner.   The concept of the restaurant is great but I recommend anyone visiting The Breadfruit should go for happy hour and get the rum punch or other tasty cocktails and skip the food - then you might not be disappointed.  :-)",

    "text": "First Friday for July (7/1/2011): This place is PACKED! Think of a sardine can. Packed. Little room to walk around from bar to seat and no room to breathe. (As soon as Breadfruit has the money, they need to expand the space! Good drinks are a total loss in such a tiny space.) Oh, and you cannot take your drink outside and sit at the cafe table-- I do not think their liquor license allows that. (Minus one star for the cramped space.)  The drinks are fantastic! They are strong, flavorful, bold drinks. Your heart may skip a beat at the prices (the rum drinks are all $8-9, the beer is $4-5.50, and the wine is $8-12/glass), but the drink is worth the money. My one (1) mojito vanilla made me intoxicated. Yes, I am a light weight, but I usually need 2-3 drinks to do the trick. (Seriously, five star drinks)   The mojitos are fan-tas-tic. Wonderful. Delicious. The Matuselum Platino rum used in the mojitos is smooth and tasty. The muddled mint is powerful, but it does not overpower the drink. It is a perfect balance.   My review should honestly be two lines: 1)Good, strong, delicious, pricey drinks that you should enjoy; and 2) tiny, cramped space not good for large parties or too many patrons.",

My waiter acted very pretentious as he recommended every expensive dish on the menu. He seemed disappointed when we did not order expensive drinks and food. I ordered the jerk chicken which was semi decent but over priced. I did not order the chef's special. Later my waiter brought the special by our table and basically said that we should have ordered the special. He proceeded to walk away without making eye contact. I felt like I was being harassed by him. My girlfriend ordered the curry tofu plate. Her vegetables were burnt and her tofu looked like gruel. All in all I would recommend that people go anywhere else in Phoenix. Microwave meals in your own home would be a better option. I wish I could give this place a negative star rating. F- for service and a D for food.  Yeah just do not ever go here!!!! Stay away!!!!!",

This well respected establishment takes pride and genuinely cares about the food they are serving.    -Curried Tofu  -Scallops  -Patties (tilapia)  -Brown Stew Chicken  -Carrot juice\" it's addicting  The Breadfruit focuses on Caribbean dishes in Phoenix, using locally grown, fresh organic produce.  The restaurant itself is small, but they've expanded by adding a Rum bar.  Everything is freshly squeezed and they have the drink of the day.  For the after dinner cigar smokers, there is a cigar bar where you can enjoy your cocktail and smoke your cigar.  The owner's of this establishment are very friendly and it's almost as if you are dining at their own home.  Everything is cooked to order so you can enjoy a great experience.

Both times have been Fan - Tastic!!! Last night we started with the scallops and a couple of drinks. The scallops were amazing. Spicy and perfectly cooked. The portion is a bit small, though, for the price (2 big scallops for 12$). I ordered the pork belly and it was tender and delicious. It came on top of a white bean mash with a sweet and spicy sauce. SO Good!!! The BF got the jerk pork with polenta. OH Em Gee.... I could eat that everyday (but I wouldn't...of course.... *looks around*). It was spicy...spicy enough to make my nose run a little. It was flavorful...smoky, spicy, and savory. The polenta was the perfect side to go with the meat too. *droooool* For dessert we had the chocolate and orange souffle.... The souffle was very good...molten and delicious chocolate with just enough orange flavor...but the thing that made it...rum whipped cream. Yes, you read it right....RUM whipped cream!!! It was perfect with the souffle and just such a good idea overall. Yes, it is expensive, but I had a fabulous time there, it is cute and intimate, and the food is awesome. The service is great, attentive, but not too attentive. I will definitely be back.  PS be sure to make reservations...this place is tiny and gets booked up.",

I couldn't wait to try them.  I love avocado and they sounded amazing.  For the price ($7.50, I think) you only get two eggrolls cut in half.  I thought that was a bit pricey.  They were a huge disappointment.. Plantains are a bit mushy and bland as a rule and so are avocados.  So together you got a bland, mushy eggroll wrapped in a flavorless wonton wrapping.  It came with a mango puress dipping sauce which was sweet but not very flavorful and mushy.  lol  For dinner I had the coconut curry tofu.  The tofu had a texture I have never experienced before and at first I didn't like it but it really grew on me.  The rice was blah, the coconut steamed vegetables was boring from how they sound and the fried plantain was good.  The restaurant is cute though and the service really good.",

    "text": "The owner was great! He let us sit at the bar (asking patrons to move to make room for the four of us) without a reservation. Once we sat the bartender helped us to choose drinks and food. Hands down some of the best Jamaican food I have eaten. The owner even suggested a great pairing for my escavitch fish, the daiquiri agricole was strong and an excellent pair to the spicy fish!   This place was so good we recommended it to other friends who went later that night, but because it was late they had already run out of some of their menu items. So I might suggest getting an earlier reservation so you get a chance to try the plantains and the fresh food! Go early...this place is small and fills fast!",

    "text": "I have been to the Breadfruit a couple times...I've always enjoyed it. I was sadly a little turned off this last time because of our server. We ate on the rum bar side & he was the bartender...and I have just never dealt with a more pushy waiter. He basically forced my friend to order their drink special, and then would not stop talking about the scallops...I seriously thought he was just going to order them for us. It really took me aback. Don't push so hard dude...  We split the Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls - AWESOME. We both decided on the Jerk Shrimp salad, which was also really great. I've had their chicken, fish and those damn scallops...and they were all good. All drinks are based with rum, so if you like rum...uh, duh.  I think my favorite thing there is their French press coffee served with a little coconut milk...you barely need it! Their fresh carrot juice is delicious too, believe me.   I guess overall, a nice place to grab drinks or dinner if you're in downtown Phoenix...just, please Breadfruit, LAY OFF. If I don't want something, I don't want it. Don't try to talk to me about it for 15 more minutes to convince me. I think keeping your customers is more important than one up-sell.",

    "text": "I CAN'T FEEL MY TONGUE.  I didn't know that jerk chicken translated to spice with a little chicken on the side.  I admit that I have sensitive taste buds when it comes to spicy food, but this stuff was way off my spicy-food odometer.  I would say it was flavorful, but my tastebuds were so numb after the chicken, I couldn't tell.  However, I did enjoy everything else!  The bread that comes with your meal is a \"festival\" on the menu, but it's darn good... and perhaps the thing to save you should the jerk chicken be too much.  I ordered the shrimps on the side of my jerk chicken, but I think I just got trigger happy.  One dish and and appetizer is already plenty, so if the waitress suggests a side of shrimp, I say pass.  Definitely get the plaintain avocado spring rolls.  Interesting texture and taste, plus the mango salsa on the side is quite refreshing.  Speaking of refreshing, I highly recommend the Sorrel to drink.  It's a hibiscus tea and rum blend, but you can't even taste the rum!  Mmm, perfect way to beat the Phoenix heat.  Cute little restaurant with brightly colored walls, which is a welcome change from the red, brown and tan buildings outside.  I came here while I was on a business trip, and it's walking distance from all the Downtown hotels!  I wish I had room for dessert, but I was stuffed.",

    "text": "Not many Jamaican restaurants around so our group thought it sounded interesting.  We had a reservation for 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday night which was confirmed the day before and they told us they were going to place us at the high top table in the bar.  We arrived on time and the restaurant was crowded. We noticed there was another group seated at our table.  We were a little annoyed that we had to wait 20 minutes until this group left and they cleared the table.  There was no apology, no explanation.    My friend who only drinks Vodka was not happy that they only had rum and wine.   The food was alright but no one in the group was raving about any of it, and it was pricey.",

I had a great Dark & Stormy.  The coconut curried tofu with rice, ripe plantains, and veggies was fabulous, but there were only a few plantains per plate.  If you wish to converse, it's best not to go on the weekends, when the Rum Bar is busy.  Overall, this is an intimate, great bar and restaurant. The drinks are strong, the decor is wonderful, the food is great, and the serve is prompt.",
