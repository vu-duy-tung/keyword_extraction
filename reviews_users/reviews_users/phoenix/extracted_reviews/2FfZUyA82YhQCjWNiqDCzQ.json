He knows what the people like, he knows what the people want and so he gives it to em. Don't come here looking for anything artsy or the latest burger fad, come here if you got a couple bucks on you and you want something that will hit the spot.

We were traveling up Central looking for a place to cool off and have a cold drink, when my wife Marie noticed the sign for Lenny's on the nondescript strip mall.  She had noticed \"Shakes\" on the window, so we pulled in to check it out.  Not a big place, but decorated like a diner from the 1950's but smaller.  Lenny's was busy.  People in line, people sitting enjoying their food. We got in line and quickly moved up to the counter.  Marie ordered a 32 oz. mint cookie shake and I ordered a 32 oz. vanilla shake and an order of french fry for both of us.  The total for the order was $11.00.   We waited about 3 minutes and our fries were ready.  Picking that up at the counter, I see they are making our huge shakes.  Another 2 minutes and our shakes were ready.  Both of us found the flavors very enjoyable and the ice cream treat was cold and refreshing.  The fries were tasty and we snacked on them as we sipped our way into a sugar coma.  We were able to watch the burgers being made as we sat at our small booth and both commented on how good they looked.  Next time I'm in central Phoenix I will check out the taste of the burgers.",

    "text": "I honestly do not know why this place has the rating it does.  The wife and I went to the other location first, as she wanted to try the tuna melt.  After waiting in line, my wife ordered the tuna melt. The cashier then informed us (with a bit of attitude) that they don't have the tuna melt.  We then drove to this location, as we were heading to that part of town anyways.  They have the tuna melt.  My wife ordered it with onion rings (which they did not give us, they rang it up for fries instead....  After waiting fairly long, we finally got out food, sans the onion rings. Since the place was so slow on getting the food out, we just let it go.  The burger was boring, nothing special. Same with the fries as well. Honestly, In and Out is the same money, and tastes much better. There honestly was nothing flavorwise that stood out our entire meal. It is just another boring burger joint trying to cash in on nostalgia.  The reason I am only giving them two stars? The place was NASTY dirty. I nearly slipped on some ketchup that was all over the floor in front of the register. The cashier seen this, and did nothing.  The area where the drink machine and condiments were - was disgusting. It looked like it had not been cleaned once that day. There was spilled ketchup, sticky drink residue, etc all over the area.  They had both areas opened up, and finding a clean table was a challenge. I do not think they had anyone that was cleaning tables. The floor was filthy as well. My wife said it was so bad, if they gave her a mop she would even be compelled to clean it.  If I had to use the restroom, I would have held it - because with as poor shape as the main areas were, I would hate to see the restrooms.  It was a good value, well priced - albeit nothing special. However the absolute lack of any effort in keeping the place clean will ensure we never return.",

    "text": "Ahh, Lenny's. That super ghetto string of burger joints in Phoenix which just happens to have the best burger in the valley. Certainly better than the shithole in Tempe known as Ted's.   Wait, the one on Thomas & Central isn't ghetto, is in fact super nice, and has an awesome 5 & Diner type theme? Lies.   To my delight, it was True. When my work moved here I had to try it right away. This Lenny's is extremely clean, inviting, and has a great atmosphere. As always, the food is superb. They have a pretty extensive burger menu with the best items being the plain old single, double, triple, and Mexican burgers. They give you a ton of options for each burger order on top of that. They also have shakes, onion rings, a bunch of other appetizer type foods, and a very simple combo structure for each type of burger. Perhaps even more notable is that Lenny's is cheap. You can come out of there with a very filling meal for $4-7.  Supposedly this place gets packed in during lunch due to all of the office buildings in the area. I don't go during that time so it's hard for me to say. I do know that they recently expanded the seating area. Available space should be a bit more than double what it was before, so if the crowd was always a deal breaker don't be afraid to try again. Otherwise, I usually go after about 4PM and the place is completely dead.  The only bad things I can say about this Lenny's is that the hours aren't too great and it cannot accommodate groups. Every dining table is tiny and Lenny's has a 7PM closing time on a weekday. This is pretty common for most eateries around Thomas & Central. Hell, the Best of Philly across the street from Lenny's closes at 4PM every day which is a fucking joke.  Oh, also, get the Jalapeno Chili Cheese Fries. You won't regret it.",

The one is really cool looking, with the feeling that you've stepped into a 50's diner, or a restaurant with history instead of one in just a strip mall.  Small booths line one side, and you can sit right at the counter, but everyone orders the same - walk up to a guy and tell him what you want.  Before I'd filled up my soda can my burger and fries were hot and ready go to.  And SO good!    Great mix of folks there, cops, guys in suits, folk who live in the general area and of course all the folks who work in walking distance.  If you call ahead there is a special place where you can pick up the orders too in case you're getting it for the whole office.  I held back on getting a shake, but at other locations it's the shake that makes the visit.  They have so many flavors and they'll mix them for no additional cost.  Flavors include vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, banana, caramel, peanut butter, pineapple, cherry, cinnamon, and several others.  I spent a good 5 minutes just staring at the board and coming up with potential flavor combos.  Mmmmm....  It's not going to be the best burger in Phoenix or anything, but it's fast, it's simple, and the location itself is pretty cool.  Oh yea - they also have hot dogs and other goodies, but to me, it's all about burger, fries and a shake.",

I mean, In-N-Out is better than this place for cryin out loud!   Frozen fries, a GIANT soda, and a crappy burger ran me right around 10 bucks, and nothing was very appetizing. I understand the nostalgia for a place like this, but c'mon. Lenny's doesn't even belong in the conversation for \"best burger in Phoenix\". I did notice several other patrons getting the hot dogs and chili dogs and whatnot, and if (and that's a big IF) I ever make it back here I certainly won't be having the burger. Very disappointing Yelp, very disappointing indeed....",

Saw the Yelp decal in the window and was further intrigued by the neat retro decor and busy, vibrant atmosphere, and decided to give it a shot.....and I'm glad I did!  Despite a pronounced lunchtime crowd, the line to order moved quickly enough that I barely had enough time to check out the menu. Went for the safe bet of a double cheeseburger combo and then added the 2 for $2 chili coney dogs on as a shameful impulse purchase, haha. The staff members taking and then serving my order were friendly and courteous despite the frantic pace of the lunch rush.   I typically eat pretty light dying the week, especially at lunch, so this glutonous meal was a major departure that'll require some extra time in the gym to work off, but so worth it. Coneys were quite good despite being the 'special' and even though I couldn't finish them, they were so cheap it didn't matter, lol, fries were outstanding and perfect doneness, but the real treat was the burger. Large, loaded with \"everything\", dripping with melted cheese, and what a flavor. Easily one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Will definitely return!",

It looked great but unfortunately I was a bit dissapointed.  Too bad because the condiments were fresh, the fries were hot but the patty was NOT. It was cooked ok but it looks like they pre-cook them. At least throw them on the grill to heat up so the meat is warm and the cheese is melted or better yet cook it to order.",

I went for a late lunch on a Thursday so it was slow when I was there.  I loved the 50's diner look of the place.  Everything from the tile to the art to the booths was very nostalgic (says the 25-year-old).  I ordered the cowboy burger and onions rings with an Oreo cheesecake shake.  I sat a the booth where I could watch my burger get set on grill and my onion rings dropped in the oil.  Made to order is no joke there.  The food was very good.  The burger wasn't anything fancy or new but it was a good, and fresh.  The onion rings were straight-up dope.  I highly recommend the fry sauce to go with fries or onion rings.  It has just the right amount of kick.  the shake was insanely good.  If I'm downtown and looking for a burger again, this is definitely where I'll be going.",

As I was leaving, I took a peek into the kitchen and saw one of the cooks pull out burger patties out of a steel container. The burger patties were soaked and looked cooked already. So basically they reheated these old cooked patties and served them to the guests.   If I want reheated yesterdays burger patties, then I will go to McDonald's. Sorry Lenny.",

I watched my burger patty get pulled out of a bin of sorts, which I assume was filled with beef stock, and then basically reheated on the grill. My burger was actually less satisfying than the same style of burger would have been from Burger King.   I'm also not a fan of the fries.  Plenty of other burger joints that cost about the same around here that have much better food.   Maybe it was an off day, I don't know, but what I do know is that I will not be coming back. Why would I pay nearly $8 for a burger combo meal that wasn't even as good as Burger King.   Voted best burger in 2010? It must have been a rough five years. I'm sorry Lenny, but I have much higher expectations.  I literally just got off a 6 hour shift on the line at the restaurant I work at, and I can appreciate a greasy burger as much as the next guy but come on.",

They close at 7pm during the week and they close at 2pm on Saturday they are closed on Sunday. So if you get off work and can survive rush hour you will make it on time to be treated like a nuisance by the staff who just want to get out of there. Me and my friends arrived at 6pm sharp and when we walked in we weren't met with the smiles this place is known for we were met with looks of annoyance. The customer service was so bad that it made the dining experience unbearably awkward. The food was messy and rushed and just not worth the money. So word of advice if you're going to this establishment be there well before they close if you want the service and quality to match with what you pay for.",

There are alot of great food places around this place along with a five guys (reoccurring theme) which are in the area. In my opinion spend your money at one of those.

So, I took a chance on s single with 1000 Island , cheese and all the fixins (but onion).  Of course, I had to have fries and a chocolate shake with it.  Go big or go home, right!?!?  The burger was just delicious, high quality beef perfectly cooked with delicious , fresh veggies and a soft sesame seed bun.    I only have 2 or 3 burgers a year so I try to make them count....this did not disappoint!    The shake was deliciously creamy, True flavored, and just thick enough.  It was perfect for dipping my fries.  Don't judge until you're tried it :)  The fries were OK but I will be ordering onion rings next time...I think my tastes have changed in terms of sides, I just don't seem to appreciate fries as much anymore.  The restaurant is cute; it's reminiscent of a 50's malt shop.  This really makes the meal more enjoyable!  I was really pleasantly surprised and highly  recommend Lenny's for a relaxed, unfussy, tasty burger.  P.S.  I went to Lenny's  again  today for a total of TWO times this week.  I called my order in for pickup and tried the onion rings this time.  They were really delicious ...light and not at all greasy!  The batter was not salty and clung nicely to the sweet, tender onions.    When I got there, I was told that my shake would be no charge as I had spilled part of  my shake from the last visit.  I was really impressed by that gesture and wanted to amend this review to let folks know what kinds of people are managing Lenny's!",

But one major flaw is that they need a display on their point of sale system showing you what you have ordered before you pay (just like their Glendale location), because I have had my order messed up more than quite a few times here, usually they forget my extra french fries, or place everything in the world on my cheese burger, when I only wanted the cheese, meat, and bun.  Other than that, I don't really have anything negative to say about this place.

The place serves up a fantastic quick burger for a very low price.   For just $6.75, I had a Mexican Burger Combo. The beef is wonderful and the burger is topped with grilled Onions, green chilies and jack and cheddar cheese. The only thing I didn't care for was the mayo. I thought it was very unnecessary to slab mayo on both buns, but I am not a mayo lover like most people are. This beats anything that Five Guys, In & Out, McDonalds, Burger King or Jack in the Box offers.  High quality food, low price.  The fries weren't all that special, but there are countless options of upgrades (including onion rings and sweet potato fries) which I'll have to try sometime.   The place screams all American 50's dinner. All red and metal. This is the kind of place you see in movies like \"American Graffiti.\" The only negative is the location and parking lot. Because of the light rail in the middle of Central, it's hard to get in and out. The lot is also very small for the amount of businesses located in the plaza. I Could see it being a pain to navigate during a busy weekday lunch rush.  There's a huge menu of good cheap food.  If you're looking for a classic burger, hot dog, and fries...  Look no further than Lenny's!",

I came here however for the 5 buck lunch ($5.83 if you're keeping score). I asked for grilled onions on the burger which would immediately come back to haunt me. They offer dippers which are various sauces (1000 island, cheese, lennys, fry sauce etc.) for 30 cents. At first you'd probably be like, \"30 cents!? You can't just make it free.\" But I get it. It's a way to minimize expenses. I'm not that put out. I bought the fry sauce. For those of you not from Utah or the surrounding states, fry sauce is best described as a 1000 island without the relish. It varies in its spices and ratios of mayo to ketchup to whatever but it's basically a poor man's 1000 island. It originated in Utah at Artic Circle. Anyhow my meal came out. The fries were fresh and lightly dashed with seasoning salt. The burger was tiny, but it was the value burger so what can you expect. They put fresh onions on it which was a bummer. I asked for it to be fixed and they graciously accommodated me. The turn around was pretty quick considering how packed the place is. Not so much the number of people but the poundage. When I got my burger and bit in the patty was very thin. I giggled when I noticed that the burger was pink in the middle. I don't mind the pink. It's a burger,  in my opinion it shouldn't be well done. I was just impressed how they were able to acommplish a medium rare burger that was the thickness of a York Peppermint Patty. The grilled onions were solid. The bun was fresh but a little smashed. It's a dive what are you gonna do. I'm willing to give it another chance. You know being a chubby person and all.",

The chili cheese fries were exactly what I grew up eating, chili with beans and melted cheese smothering the fries! Mmm mouth watering deliciousness in those fries!  Chicken sandwich has a great taste, perhaps the chicken was seasoned making it taste better.  The sandwich was a little messy to eat, but that's what makes the food so good.  You won't waste a bite.

By the time we found a seat at the counter our food was ready ( about 5 minutes ) I was impressed that they got it done so fast. When I took the first bite and the cheese and the juice from the burger patties started to run down my face and hands I knew I was in love. The burger was juicy and flavorful and the fries were very hot and crispy. I was barely able to finish the burger, but it was soooo good I had to eat it all.  We watched them make the burgers while we sat at the counter and were to see other types of burgers to give ideas of what to get next time. Our bill came to only $11.07 and we were both stuffed for the rest of the day. I will definitely be back again and again.",

Looked great! Prices were decent. I was told to get the Cowboy burger because it was \"really\" good, eh, I've had better. It literally crumbled in my hands, maybe too much sauce? I don't know but with the use of a napkin, LOTS of them, I was able to eat it, come on, I was hungry. I do have to say the the french fries SUCK. Seriously. Don't give me half cooked fries. They weren't even crispy. It was gross to be honest with you and reading other reviews, looks like I'm not the only one who thinks they should work on their french fries.  The ONLY reason why I won't come back here is because we came in early, I witnessed them cooking a ton of burgers and putting them in a dish - waiting for the \"lunch crowd\" to come in. That isn't fresh LENNY! How long are those cooked burgers going to sit there? Kinda not my thing.",

The cashier was rude when my wife asked to order her burger without certain toppings (nothing unreasonable). I ordered a chocolate shake, which they forgot to make. When we waited for them to make it, I saw that they used a blender that had been sitting out with whatever was blended in it before. The milk they used for the shake was also sitting out for who knows how long as well. When she handed me the shake, I walked out to my car without having it and threw it in the garbage. I only had a few bites of my chicken sandwich and it was stale and drenched in too much mayo. Assuming the mayo and chicken was sitting out like the blender, it's no surprise I now feel pretty ill.   We'll never be back and tell all of our friends that also live downtown to avoid Lenny's. Disgusting and disappointing.",

I'm a pretty big burger lover, will even order one in a fancy restaurant if I think it'll be good in that particular place.  The burger was \"ok,\" a disappointment compared to what I thought I'd be getting.  In fact, it tasted EXACTLY like Burger King.  It even looked like a Burger King hamburger (which in my opinion is not good at all).  The fries were delicious, plentiful and seasoned very nicely.  They did their job quite well.  The interior of the restaurant is fun, light-hearted 50's retro diner for sure. It's a good time to look at the pics on the wall.  They put a lot into the look of the place and it shows.   Also, the staff was fast and helpful and my order was ready in no time at all (and I was there during lunch rush!).  So, in all - a good lunch place for cheap and a fun dining experience.  But don't drive all the way down here for the burgers if you live far away.  They are average at best.  Frankly, if you're up for driving and want a good burger, you're better off at FatBurger (Mill ave) or try the burger at Jilly's up in Scottsdale (very good).",

Like, there was an ass at our table (that wasn't ours) Guard against this and you get the 50s sock hop music and feel that isn't easy to find in the Phx area.

    "text": "Just picked up some food from Lenny's for the first time.  I got a burger and some cheese fries.  The food came out within 2 minutes, and was slammed down on the counter by a rude girl.  That was my first impression.  There was also no place near the drink station to throw away any trash, so people left straw wrapping paper all over the place and no one cleaned it up.  I decided to throw mine away in the trash can near the door, which was covered in endless amounts of grime because they haven't cleaned anything in months.  The place is a filthy wreck.  That was my second impression.  I live just down the street, at Clarendon, and got my food home within maybe 6 minutes.  My cheese fries were so soggy they turned to mush and fell apart in my fingers.  They were also cold, and had obviously been sitting somewhere for a while before they served it to me.  They were not fresh, and I have no idea how long they had been stored in that container.  The cheese tasted OK after I microwaved it, but the fries were essentially mashed potatoes and not fresh and didn't taste special at all.  I couldn't even pick them up with my fingers, they were like mud.  So, to put it simply, their fries sucked.  The burger, which somehow magically took 2 minutes to make, was under-cooked.  The ground beef was pink and tasted raw.  The cheap bun was wet and soggy and was coming apart in 3 places.  The fixins that go in the burger were all over the place and completely fell out all over my coffee table.  This had to be the single worst burger I have ever gotten anywhere, about as bad as a burger that gave me food poisoning a couple of weeks ago.    I microwaved the burger and tried to put some of it back together but it was in a million pieces, so it was impossible to enjoy it.  It tasted like every burger you've ever had at any crappy greasy spoon, literally nothing redeeming about it.  It was awful.  I don't understand how a place that is filthy, with rude service, which gives out mushy stale food, and under-cooked beef, is still in business.  It is possibly the worst burger joint I've ever been to.  From my first impression until I tried the food, all of it was wrong.  I normally go to The Stand on Indian School for my burgers, where they are perfect every single time.  Their burgers can't be beat.  I was in a hurry so I thought I would try Lenny's and I have to say it was damned awful, just awful.  I will never ever ever ever go back to that place again.  Everything was terrible, everything.  I don't get how the place is still in business.  Whoever the clown is who is managing that place needs to be fired.",

The poblano chiles were a different story - I had two big fat pieces! It was kind of hard to bite into the burger without grabbing one big piece out! I wish they cut them in pieces!

    "text": "We came here for a quick and easy lunch, and sure enough, within about 3 minutes of ordering, our burgers were ready. This was my first time coming here and if I ever come back to Phoenix, I might consider stopping by. I ordered the Buffalo Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It wasn't actually shown on the menu, but a TV had displayed this option which sparked my interest. The burger itself was very good: the chicken was cooked nicely, although I'm not sure it was as crispy as I would like it to have been. I'm a sweet tea fanatic so I have to mention the sweet tea as well, which was pretty average and could have been WAY better. I only took about 10 sips or so. Overall, I would recommend Lenny's for a quick burger with a lot of selections for fries. This place stays True to what they are, so if you're looking for a place to blow your mind, this may not be it.",

Patty wasn't dry and the lettuce, onions, and tomatoes seemed fresh. The burger also had melted cheese and was sufficiently saucy for my taste. Fries were hot, not overly-salty and crunchy. Overall, it was a good meal. The pricing is decent, standard diner prices--pretty affordable, I'd say--and the menu offers some interesting options like the green chile burger. Definitely returning to try some of their other options next time! Bacon cheese fries mmmmm!",

Fries were ok, nothing to write home about.  Service: blank stares from girl at register was a bit awkward. Ordering at the register is also awkward because it's also the counter eating area. Bad design and flow.  Lastly but most important. We arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday. First thing we noticed when we walked in were the chairs overturned on most of the tables. We thought this was odd since it was a full hour until they officially close. We (family of 4) sat in the section that has most larger tables. Just as we got our order one of the staff starts cleaning right next t us and placing the remaining chairs up on the tables around us. Then to top it off, she chains the section off!!! When we were through with our meal we literally had to unchain the section barrier to leave!!  This place is a disaster. Food sucks. Prices high and service abysmal. We so wish we would have ventured down the road a bit more to The Habit!! Ciao Lenny's! This family won't be returning.",

I've recently moved offices to a mere block away from Lenny's and couldn't take the torture of smelling my co-workers fries anymore, so I decided to give it a try.  I'll just say it was everything I had hoped for.   When I arrived promptly at noon, the place was already packed (good sign of deliciousness), so I hopped in line and pondered all the options for building my burger.  As a vegetarian, I get excited to see a menu that gives me options. I was pleasantly rang up by Lenny himself, who greeted me with a hand shake!  I decided on the Veggie burger topped with Cheddar cheese, BBQ, Ranch and green olives (Why not), with a side of sweet potato fries.  My meal was cooked to order, and only took about 10 minutes.  After picking up my order,  the long (20 ft) walk from the counter to the table was a test of my inner strength, as I wanted to plow my face into the shiny orange fries.  I contained myself for the moment and then devoured every last one of them.  Lenny's was definitely a lunch time treat and I will be back.  Although next time I need to plan a nap hour after my visit, because I was in a food comma!",

The breakfast burritos are a little greasy but what can you expect from a diner in a strip mall.  I do love that they have biscuits and gravy for breakfast and the cholula is flowing.  Also, the sweet potato fries are yum!",

Fries were half seasoned and I could tell very little care was given to assembling my burger; mostly because I saw the girl doing it and she was chatting to another coworker the entire time.   What really bothered me was that after I sat down with my meal, I watched as the staff pulled down parts of the ventilation system over food cooking for customers that they then turned around and served. Makes me question what happened around my food that I didn't see. Then I saw that the buns that come out of the verticals toaster touch what looks like a cleaning rag.   Needless to say I WILL NOT be coming back here nor will I tell anyone to come here and will go so far as to discourage anyone from coming.   Seriously hope no one gets food poisoning.",

Right on tram line it can get a bit packed in the afternoon with school kids, and packed at lunch with local employees but the food is always delicious.  They have some seriously huge burgers, though their buns don't quite hold up well to the grease. I love their ham and cheese which is piled high with black forest ham and absolutely oozes cheese and ham grease. The fries are simple and could be better but they offer options like chili fries, cheese fries, and mixtures of the two (even with bacon).   The place has a very '50s feel and is great if you're looking for diner faire. Great burgers, shakes, sandwiches, and more interesting options like Frito chili pie, chili dogs, and piled up French fries. Though be warned, eat quickly because the fries and buns definitely get soggy fast.",

Also, I hate places that decide ahead of time what should be on the burger they serve you. How about you just let me order a burger and TELL YOU what you're gonna put on it?

Kept it simple and ordered the #1, which was a single burger with cheese and all the fixings, a very generous portion of french fries, and a drink for $8.47.  The food was all delicious, fries were crisp and seasoned well.  The staff was friendly and my order to go was ready in just a few minutes.    The fries weren't piping hot when I got them which means they were probably sitting for at least a short time but stayed crisp till I finished them, and were seasoned really well.  The price point on the single burger and fries combo is probably $1-$2 higher than Lucky's but all in all I'd come back and would love to try one of the speciality burgers.",

Their ranch is pretty gross, so that definitely knocked some points for me. If you dine inside, it's absolutely disgusting. Like there are literally dead flies on the windows. There's mold on the floor. The seats look like they haven't been wiped in forever. The place just looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. It makes me wonder if I should be eating at this particular Lenny's.. but here I am. I'd say go to a different location that doesn't have dead, crusted flies on the window seal. Food is great.

I had a \"build your own burger\" with Jack cheese, jalapenos, avocado and 1000 Island dressing. SO good, the fries were hot and crispy, too! It wasn't a grease bucket burger place, the burger was surprisingly not greasy at all. I didn't even feel as guilty as I thought I would because it was clearly good quality meat.

Both times I have been, we went on a weekday in the evening.  They close down half of the shop, since lunchtime is their busiest.  It is across the street from my fav place, Best of Philly.  What a hard choice between the two, especially when my hubby loves Lenny's and I love Philly.    The first time I went I saw a picture of their Chili Cheese Fries in the window and knew I had to have them.  It took me forever to figure out what type of burger I wanted though, b/c they have combos that they have created and then a ton of different ways to create your own.  I decided on the Sourdough Burger and it was super tasty.  The sourdough is toasted and the burger is juicy.  Perfect!  As for the chili cheese fries...incredibly good!  I did try their regular fries on my second visit and the seasoning they put on them is really good too.    My husband just loves the Mexican Burger, which has green chile on it and pepper jack cheese.  He is obsessed with it and pretty much dreams about it, and both times I have been in I have heard people also ordering it.    The atmosphere is one of an old diner with a white tin roof and tiled counters.  One gripe I have is that they don't seem to keep it cool enough inside.  There are ceiling fans, but the sun blasts into the front windows and I end up sweating while I am eating.  It's uncomfortable, so that is what prevents me from giving them 5 stars.",

It took me a while because like most local downtown-midtown restaurants it closes early.  Hours are 8am - 7pm Monday to Friday. Sucks closed on the weekend.  I work a lot so I usually get out of work late.  I had the Mexican burger without mayonnaise.  I dis-like mayonnaise on burgers and sandwiches.  I find it rather appalling.  The only time I have mayonnaise is when it plays a minor role in potato salad or if it is fresh made aioli.   Sorry my mind tends to wander.  Back to the burger!!  They reason they call it a Mexican burger is because of the green chilies.  I believe them  to be a New Mexico Hatch chilies.  Don't be scared of the word chili if you don't know Hatch green chilies are very mild.  It was also cheesy and greasy which are the sign of a good burger.  The fry's were crisp and delicious. Fry's are another one of my favorite foods, which I don't like to share with people.  So if I go out to eat with somebody I tell them they better order their own basket.    They also have great desserts.  I had a banana split.  The only issue I have is that their root beer floats are made with Mug root beer because they serve Pepsi products.  Mug is the worst root beer I have ever had.  The best thing about this place is that it is very reasonable priced.  To order one of their burger combos with fry's and a 32 ounce drink goes for: $4.99 to $6:99.  It is always cool to find a cheap cool hang out because I am very frugal.    The restaurant is located in a strip mall on the southeast corner of Thomas & Central.  It is easy to spot because  it has huge neon signs in the windows.  When you go inside is when you feel as you have stepped into a 50's dinner in a stand alone building.  It has diamond pattered stainless steel panels all over the walls.  Which honestly is a little dis-orientating but cool.  Also, with red table tops, red benches and metal chairs.  Plus a lot more 50's decor.  I will definitely be going often.  I guess I will have to sneak out of work early or take a long lunch break to go there.",

I wish we went to McDonalds or drove all the way to In and Out instead. The fries and onion rings were good though. I can't understand the raving reviews for this place.",

I left my office on central and clarendon at 11:55AM, and didn't pull into the Lenny's parking lot a half mile down the road until 12:10PM. Of course, the stop and go traffic in downtown Phoenix at lunch hour really has no bearing on this review other than to show it is not worth the drive.   Upon entering I was instantly immersed in a crowd of 40 something yuppies desperately trying to prove they are hip in some way. Why trendy fast food restaurants have become a haven for them I have no idea.   Anyway, the service was quick considering how busy the place was. I ordered a double burger with cheese and fries. I was anticipating a tasty burger with good fries. Unfortunately what I got was simply an average burger with tasteless fries. It was basically like eating at McDonald's but without feeling sick afterwords. (Maybe that is the appeal?)  Whatever the case, I see no reason to fight through stop and go traffic and brigades of annoying white urban professionals to get an average at best burger when I could go to Burger Factory down the street and get the same of better quality burger without the traffic or crowds.",

The employees didn't care much just doing the job said nothing and actually checked my ID when using my credit card for like 8 bucks which isn't a big deal but still odd.  Anyways my cowboy burger came and the meat was dry, lettuce and tomatoes didn't seem very fresh, it was very bland burger. The fries were decent though so ill give them that.

    "text": "Three starts isn't a bad thing. It's a solid three stars. A noble three stars.  My boyfriend and I found this place after looking for a burger joint in our area. More specifically, we were looking for something cheap but not as yucky as your typical fast food burger joint. Lenny's was the answer!  Lenny's is an unassuming, small burger place in a little strip mall off Central. Easy to miss as I know I've driven by this place a hundred times. The interior is reminiscent of a 50's diner. It's cute. It's cheap. Definitely worth paying like, $7 bucks for a combo. Far better than Wendy's or McDonalds. Don't expect this to be the best burger you've ever had because it won't be. But it will be yummy and filling. The chili cheese fries were good also, and a little birdie informed me their shakes and malts are fantastic.   My ONLY issue with the place is that on the website it says that everything is fresh and their sauces are made in house. I know the nacho cheese isn't made on site and the chili tastes like the Hormel canned version. They also make it sound like their bread is delivered daily... If someone says bread is delivered daily, I'm going to assume its coming from a local bakery and actually delivered daily. They use your regular,  run of the mill sesame seed burger buns that you order from Sysco or US Foods or Shamrock. It just sounds slightly deceptive. Obviously, I'm nit-picking. Everything was delicious. I'll come back for sure.",

After they expanded into the suite next door, I gave them another chance and have been there several times since. Today, at 1:00 pm the place was slammed and they had the second section closed so that they could clean it and get the restaurant ready to close. There was no place to sit, yet there was a whole section of empty tables that they would not let people use. There were alot of people in line wondering why a restaurant would do that in the middle of lunch. It does not make good business sense. Lenny, you were sitting with a woman and a young girl in one of the two top booths or I would have brought it up to you. There were alot of unhappy customers.  We had to sit at the tables that are sitting right by the door where everyone has to stand to order. Due to the lack of space, people had to set there food on our table so they could try to fill their drinks. At this point, my guest suggested we just take our food and leave.   The layout of this restaurant is horrible. No flow whatsoever. All the walkways are so tight you better hope that nobody else is trying to walk the other direction. I thought opening up the restaurant into the next suire would help, but it only helps if you allow people to sit there.   We won't be back, but I hope you take this into consideration before you lose any additional customers.",

    "text": "This wasn't a meal it was an experience!  The staff is very culturally diverse and friendly.  Meaning you can barely understand them through their various thick accents from around the globe; however they were calm, patient, and friendly trying their best to bridge the communication gap in their broken English.  As for environment it was kind of a cool although cramped 50's inspired burger shop.  For the food, I admittedly made a mistake by going to a burger shop and ordering hotdogs.  I will have to re-evaluate them once I attempt what they are known for, a burger.  As for what I did order it was chili cheese dogs.  The bun was acceptable though soggy.  This was the chili's fault not the bun.  The chili I have to give two ratings to.  I'm originally from Texas so am very critical of anything claiming to be chili.  From a Texans stand point this was not chili, it was a flavorless watery ground meat (of some sort) and bean soup.  So because it coated everything I ordered I'd give the food 1 out of 5.  From an Arizonan standpoint you could say the chili was passable, there are very few good chili options, so I doubt most would know the difference.  The Weiner looked like something my grandad would have if on a viagra bender.  It was old, hard, dry, wrinkly, with pink and red blotches...  Gross....  The chili cheese fries had the same issues with chili the dogs had, the cheese was also bland, but a taste of a plain fry let me know they had potential.  There are many different specialty fry combos here so maybe another option would be better.  All in all the food was under whelming so I gave a 3 out of 5 pending re-evaluation on other menu items.",

    "text": "I think in terms of local hamburger joints, Lenny's is pretty bad ass.    They have tons of toppings and ways to jazz up your burger.  You can watch them make your burger through the glass.  The shakes are pretty good as well.    It's a hole in the wall with enough character to raise it a few notches above the rest.  Other places, that are dives but good, like Lucky Boy are in the same class but Lenny's seems more like a destination as opposed to a drive thru.    However, to put in all in perspective, we're talking hamburgers here.  Nothing gourmet.  Five and diner style hamburgers, grilled sandwiches and fries.  You can add jalapenos, green chiles, chili, cheese, bacon,....whatever.  You pay one price for a drink and can choose whatever size you want.  The drinks are self serve.  It's easy on the wallet as well, as it should be.  I fed my family of five for around $35 or so.    My main criticism is the lack of big booths or more spacious seating.  Every time I go, the room with extra seating is closed off.  But seating everyone between the counter and the small booths is part of the experience, I suppose.",

Their fries are always hot and go best with the hot cheese dipping sauce. My only gripe is that they have all that wonderful grill but they can't fry an egg. All of their egg product comes in cartons. Egg with a burger? Who would'a thunk it?",
