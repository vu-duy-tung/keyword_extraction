Food was great, although we ate light so this might not be helpful to everyone... tried the vegetarian combo (hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, lentil soup, etc.) plus a full order of hummus, and finished with baklava.  We enjoyed the flavor of everything.  My dining companion tried the beer recommended by the server (a Lebanese beer called Almaza) and liked it.  I ordered a White Russian and the strength was good.  We came specifically for the dancing and were not disappointed.  There was one dancer and she made an effort to cover the entire room so everyone could see her (we've been to other restaurants where only some tables had a good view).  She also engaged well with the audience with a lot of eye contact, and she invited participation, which was fun.",

    "text": "Unfortunately still in pissy mood at going 0 for 3 in last new restaurant attempts.  Once again, a brief review filled with disappointment and regret.    Started with the Spanakopita, which was labelled as a Spinach Cheese Pie for $3.95.  It was cold.  What should have been flaky heavenly goodness in the form of phyllo dough was just greasy congealed torture, which was quite impressive with how this was so damn cold.  Maybe they should've left this in the microwave longer.  Blah.  Entree that was recommended as their house specialty was their oven roasted lamb for $11.95.  It was halfway edible as the rice was sorta interesting with pine nuts for a nice crunch, but was a little dry.  And then the lamb.  It probably wouldn't be fair to say it was dry, it would be more fair to say it was Arizonan desert sand masquerading as meat.    Damnit, so disappointed again I can't even think of a witty way to end this review.  God bless the edit button, I'll have to come back with something.",

Everything was fresh and nicely presented.  The lentil soup was a little too salty for me, but probably fine for most people. I also got a Greek salad (good light dressing) and a side of falafel, which was cooked perfectly and wasn't greasy at all.",

    "text": "First time dining here. I am visiting from out of town and my family and i were expecting a good meal.  However, i cant say that was the case. For starters our drinks were TERRIBLE. I ordered a whiskey ginger ale.  They do not have ginger ale. They have soda water and pepsi that they will give to you without warning. After returning the first set of drinks we got a second drink which was supposed to be 7up and scotch. It wasnt. I don't know what it was, but it wasn't what i ordered. I couldn't taste any scotch and my drink was still a caramel color.  The owners were constantly over our shoulders begging for praise and attention.  After getting our weak drinks we got our hummus which was not terrible but i wasn't impressed.  We all ordered our food from the female half of ownership who was insistent on us ordering the lamb. None of us are plain lamb fans so after repeatedly declining her offer we were able to order. Our server went into the back to cook our food and the busser brought out our soup. The Lentil soup lacked flavor, i was upset because it looked amazing. The tomato soup was good. Not extraordinary, but good.  Next we received our meals.  Gyro salad, beef kabob, gyro kabob and some other kabob i cannot pronounce. Ground beef in the shape of a sausage-turd. Either way, the meat was very dry, in all cases and kind of unpleasant to eat. Large chunks of unexpected toughness in my meat. The rice was plain, and lacked substance. I was hungry enough where i finished my meal, i cant say the same about the rest of my company even being as hungry as we were after a long day of traveling. After warding off the owner for a fifth and sixth time, we had to ask for our check and to go boxes which we decided upon not using anyway. I was extremely disappointed from the start, and had high hopes that it would improve with our meals, but it just never did.  I will not be returning nor will i suggest this place to my friends. I was very upset with everything because i was very excited to try this place out.   I give one star for our meal, and two for service. As obnoxious as it was having the owners constantly over our shoulders we received everything in a timely manner and our specific requests were granted.",

They always recognize your and your family when you come in to visit - even if it's only a few times a year. There is always the lamb special - leg of lamb stuffed with a blend of rice, pine nuts, and almond slivers roasted for 5-7 hours until it's falling off the bone. The lamb is served on a bed of the rice and has SO much flavor. My father always enjoys the lamb shank - in a beautiful tomato-based sauce. The meat is always tender and scrumptious.  I almost forgot to mention the soup! If you are lucky enough to get there on a night when they have the tomato soup, DO IT! The lentil is also quite tasty, however. Don't forget dessert...they make a delightful pudding with rosewater and sprinkled with crushed pistachios and drizzled with honey. Oh man...",

    "text": "Byblos! This place is fantastic! I had been going to the Yucca Tap Room (which is a dive bar and venue a hop skip and jump down the ways) for a few years and was always curious about it. \"I should check that out someday.\" Finally a friend, that I shan't name because her betrayal is still too fresh (DAMN YOU FIDDLE R! DAMN YOU TO HELLLLLLlllll!), said, \"Hey a'hole, let's go here for lunch.\" or something like that and I replied, 'Right on, bi'ch!' or something like that and I've been in love ever since; except on Mondays (I don't like Mondays *tell me why* I don't like Mondayyys...).   Mondays the service is really bad (please note business hours). Every other time I've been (I've only done lunch, penciled that shit in and everythin', yo!) and the service was exceptional. Never you mind the previous naysayer reviews about the service being poor, those people that wrote that were obviously paid by jihadi extremists who are trying to destroy the lovely owners of Bybols because they love America. You know they love us as soon as you bite into anything they've made. The homos was the first thing to touch my lips, so creamy and warm and I swear (I don't believe in a god/s by the by) that I heard the National Anthem play with the first bite. How could someone that doesn't love America give us such wonderful food? They couldn't! PROOF! F U terrorists and mercenary reviewer bastards!  After the National Anthem finished playing (it always plays every time I eat there but this particular time I was solo) I was serve a Lebanese beer (Almaza or something like that) that the owner recommended to go with my dish which he also recommended. oh em gee golly wiz! Lamb roasted in stomach lining with rice (can't remember what the dish was called; it was a special that day) and garnish and \"to kill for\" lentil soup. So good! Forget the virgins or white grapes or whatever translation you read this dish would be reward enough in this world not to ever want to be die a martyr.  After I recovered a bit from the food coma to pay my bill and leave I stopped to convert to Islam and grab a mint or handful and joyfully walked out the door.  The care put into the few dishes I've had here seems to follow through into everything about Byblos. Please, stop by and try something, you will enjoy it more than these words can tell. There is so much I still need to love there that I have yet to even try. This being laid off and going back to school has it's draw backs. Going out for good food when ever the urge strikes you is one and strippers is the other. They're just not as friendly when the only thing in your pants is fleshy.  Support you local business especially when it's this good and loves America so much.",

    "text": "This place sucks.  Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, \"Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!\" Not so.  It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.  First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.  We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.  The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight?   The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation.   So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern.",

We started with Hummus, which came out immediately. It was pretty tasty. Both Sunny and I had the falafel pita/ sandwich. I was really impressed with how moist the falafel was. Normally it comes out really dry. We also got soup with our meal. I had tomato, which was EXCELLENT and she had the lentil. I forgot to ask how it was. Georgie had some chicken and rice thing which looked good and she said she enjoyed.   Our server was a little aggressive with Georgie and Sunny because they didn't finish all of their food (yeah... I'm a big pig and devoured everything in front of me) but I think he was just trying to ensure they were happy with their meals.   For the three of us plus the takeaway chicken sandwich for my sister, the $34 tab was extremely reasonable and they handled our multiple payment methods like a champ!   Next time I am in Tempe and in the mood for some falafel, I will be back!!!",

I lived for 6 years in the Middle East, and yet I have rarely had Middle Eastern food (here or there) that matches the quality of Byblos. Their chicken and vegetarian dishes are outrageously good. For garlic lovers, the garlic dip is not to be missed! Although all of the desserts are great, it would be a tragedy to skip the honey pudding. Their Lemonade also is delicious--it has a hint of rosewater.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous. I've been coming here for years, and although it's not fancy schmancy--you can always count on having a wonderful meal.",

You can expect friendly service and an owner who will make his presence known at all the tables.  Our server was well versed in all the items and timing was prompt.  We enjoyed the spinach and cheese pie, tomato basil soup, Greek salad with lamb kabob and hummus, keufta plate, and shared a piece of baklava for dessert.  The hummus was so smooth and the pitas so soft I couldn't get enough.  The lamb was pleasantly tender and juicy.  Their version of baklava was a tad dry on the top half, but when eaten with the bottom half was good.  This version also lacked cinnamon and I could really taste the rose water.   This restaurant will definitely satisfy your craving for Greek/Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food.",

I really can't say why because it's been there forever, our large family usually going for fast food or Mexican on the rare occasion when we ate out.  We had an AMAZING meal this evening in a very comfortable atmosphere served by lovely people that are sure you have everything you'd like without being rude or invasive to our dinner conversation.  Appetizer, soup, lamb, chicken, wine, beer, dessert, & Turkish coffee to finish...we had it all and every bite, taste, drink was delicious!   This is a new favorite and I can't wait to eat here again! We eat out several times a week nowdays,  and an establishment like Byblos is ideal not only for the delicious food but for the atmosphere that allows a family to actually dine, taking our time to enjoy our meal as well as each other's company - a novel idea, I know!  And did I say how much we enjoyed the lovely belly dancer? That was the icing on the cake for us...so fun!",

I looked at reviews and got recommendations from friends and we decided to try Byblos.  Most of the family had never eaten Middle East, Persian, Greek etc so I was a bit afraid they wouldnt like it.  After they brought out the dolmas and the babba ganoush I knew this was a good place.  They were both delicious and I wish the portions were slightly bigger.  The soup was a tomato soup that was like pizza in liquid form, sooo freakin delicious, even people that dont like tomato soup will like this one!  The lentil soup was also tasty.  We all either had lamb or chicken dishes and everyone enjoyed their dinners.  Dessert was good, the baklava was small but the Honey Pudding was just something that I wish I could have every day!",

About a month and a half ago my husband and I ordered some food to-go and were pretty happy with our experience. The hummus is wonderful and the falafel is the best I've found in the valley thus far. The gyro meat is a bit thicker and a different consistency than I'm used to, but it was tasty. The soup was really great too. This place got three stars because I think the gyro meat could possibly improve a little, and the inside of the restaurant is really dated.",

I crave their tomato soup, its incredible, while my husband could eat their hummus with meat and pine nuts all day.  I like it too though so he has to share!  Everything I have ever tried here has been so good, I feel confident that anything I order will be tasty.   Because of this, Byblos is a great place to bring guests or even larger groups.  I know that everyone can find some good choices here, and its not too overwhelming for someone who has never had ethnic foods.  At the same time, the middleeastern dishes are so good, if you are more familiar with them, you have a range to choose from.  Being able to come on a Saturday night and seat a table for six without a reservation or a long wait was nice, but I think we were fortunate.  It's a nice place for a casual dinner, or to celebrate a special occasion.  The prices are fair, so you can afford to take another couple out for dinner if you like too.   Some nights feature belly dancers, and other nights its more of a family atmosphere.  The waitstaff is very good at reading your need for either alone time with your date or interaction with your server.  Ive seen a belly dancer dance with toddlers and also had one come over to dance for my husband's birthday, always done tastefully. One great way to 'shop local' is to support local restaurants, and Im happy to say that Ive seen the owners out shopping local as well.  Its nice to see the local economy in action, and wherever I have seen them, they are always so warm and welcoming outside the restaurant too.  Go for the food, go for the experience, go for any of the many reasons and I think you will find a new favorite as well!",

I really was torn whether to give it 4 stars, but I felt too underwhelmed to give it anything more than 3.  Let's start with the good: the tomato soup they serve as a side for their entrees is DELICIOUS and creamy and rich. their hummus is also really good! our server was very friendly.  The not so good: the pitas they served with their hummus were a little hard/dry. they served french fries (the crinkly frozen kind) as a side for their gyro. service is extreeeeemely slow.  luckily we were not in a hurry, but literally from the time we finished our food to the time when anyone came by to see if we were done or wanted the check it was 20 minutes. and when we first sat down to order it was a good 10 minutes before we got water or anyone asked what we wanted to order. I suppose it's part of the charm of being a family business, but just keep that in mind and don't plan on rushing through a meal here.  The bad: I ordered the greek salad combo with lamb kebab and hummus.  the lamb kebab was literally just 3 chunks of kebab (and I didn't like the flavor). and the hummus came in a tiny condiment cup, but with nothing to dip it into?  I've never heard of eating hummus on top of a salad, but maybe that's what I was supposed to do. also I felt a little pressured when our server kept asking us if we wanted something to drink other than water or if we wanted to order appetizer, dessert, etc. - you get the picture",

Mostly delicious, lovely atmosphere and lighting, friendly family owners, and nice belly dancing the second visit. Enjoyed their dolmas, lamb shank special (moist and falling from the bone), tomato soup, kibbe (delish!), and the salad with lamb kebab and hummus (would definitely order again). Lebanese friend was underwhelmed by the bland veggie moussaka but loved the kibbe, and big thumbs-up on the m'jadara. I look forward to returning on next visit to try the loubieh and foul and revisiting the lamb kebab. Don't let the male owner talk you into anything you don't want to eat - he was a little high pressure on the lamb specials the second go-round, but the kebabs are also delicious.",

    "text": "It's an annual thing, visiting Byblos for Susanna A's birthday gathering, and for this, the 4th or 5th time, another quality dining experience.  Over the years I've sampled from the gyro platter, the keufta khachkach, schwarmas, and roast chicken, on up to last night's \"Mediterranean Chicken\", a pleasing chicken in sauce, for me spread over a bed of soft, perfectly cooked rice, accompanied by a cup of satisfyingly homemade tasting tomato soup: $11.95 +$2 iced tea, tax & tip and out for well under $20.    Dining area is pleasant, fairly large, has both booths and tables not too close together.  Comfortable and uncramped, middle eastern music playing softly in the background. White tablecloths and cloth napkins add a nice touch.  The older gentleman took our orders, his bad knees forcing him to sit while he did so, but just made for more homey experience as he engaged in brief light conversation, gently encouraging \"the lamb\", but which tonight we all shied away from in favor of less expensive fare.  Other staff delivered our plates, filled and refilled our water and tea glasses.  Our party of 6 was well-served and glasses never had a chance to be dry for more than a few seconds if at all.  Several of us shared a bite of Susanna's chocolate cake, met all hopes and expectations, qualifying as \"scrumptious\" all around.  I've had their baklava in the past and it too was not disappointing, a moist honey-drenched delight as opposed to the petrified dehydrated shredded wheat like offering you'll occasionally find elsewhere if not fresh.  The restrooms are towards the back of the dining room through the swinging double-doors, ladies to the left, men to the right.  The men's room is attractive but nothing \"fancy\".  It was and has always been on my visits, clean.  It's of decent size and un-cramped, with  one stall, one urinal, sink and mirror, and a new automatic paper towel dispenser.    All in all another very pleasant dining experience I'd encourage anyone to try. Though much of the menu is closer to $20 than my satisfying Med Chicken, barring too many extra drinks, I think you'd be hard-pressed to make the tab exceed $30 a person, and I believe you will be satisfied with the quality of the fare for your funds.   It's a family business with sister as chef, and brother out front.  Belly dancing by neither on Saturday nights.",

    "text": "Good Food, Mixed Feelings...  Following a craving I've had for Lebanese Garlic Sauce, I ended up at Byblos for a much anticipated late lunch. I also brought along a printed coupon they had displayed on their web site.  I had called ahead to ensure that their garlic sauce wasn't the garlic mayonnaise mixture (yuk) I had been served at another restaurant in town as garlic sauce. The person who answered my call to Byblos assured me that there was no mayonnaise in their garlic sauce. I set out anticipating a nice mouthful of savory emulsified garlic, lemon juice and olive oil - or something approximating that - like I always used to be served in my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis.  I was seated and provided with water and a menu immediately. I arrived after the lunch rush was past so service was not a problem.   I was going to order the grilled chicken breast lunch plate, which was served with garlic dip, but the owner encouraged me to try the chef's special of the day instead. The special was spinach simmered with ground beef and spices and served with rice pilaf and hummus. It included a cup of their tomato soup. I also ordered garlic dip to go, and a glass of their yogurt drink.  My soup was brought almost immediately, and was absolutely delicious. I could eat that soup daily! My main course was not far behind. It was good, but left me wishing I had ordered something with punch to it. I was really glad I had ordered the yogurt drink as it gave my meal additional flavor dimension.  I was left wanting something additional, so I ordered the Honey Pudding for dessert. I really don't know how to describe it, but it was fabulous and wonderfully creamy!  I was feeling that I'd had a good experience overall, and before the check was brought I gave the server the coupon I had printed from their website. It read:  \"$5.00 OFF Any Dining Experience of $20 or more. - Cannot be applied to the purchase of alcoholic beverages - Coupons may not be combined with any other offer - Not valid on Holidays or special events - Coupon void if altered - One coupon per party - Expires 07/31/2015\"  The server took the coupon and a few minutes later, the owner came over and explained that the coupon was only good for dinner. Nothing on the coupon (above) or the website had indicated to me that it was for dinner only, and I had intentionally spent over $20 on food because $5 off seemed a good reason to do so. Of course, he was the owner so his interpretation prevailed. I didn't make a scene over it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Finally, the much awaited garlic dip! I opened it at home a short while later. It smelled nice and garlicky, but was not at all what I was looking forward to. I don't know what it was made from, but it had a texture a bit thicker than hummus. It was sort of like dry garlicky mashed potatoes. There was apparently no lemon in it. I should have asked more questions. So, at this point my quest for garlic sauce remains unfulfilled.",

He only eats hummus from this restaurant and I can see why, it's so creamy and delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. I ordered the Greek salad with Chicken and garlic sauce. Started off with the lentil soup that was delicious, the lentils were pureed which I liked. I don't like large pieces/chunky veggies in my soup so this worked out perfectly.  The salad was okay, they were really nice when I asked for it without tomato. My only issue was the amount of vinagrette/oil that was added. It made my lettuce soggy and was just unappetizing towards the end of my meal. I liked the chicken and charred red peppers, the garlic sauce is awesome! my husband and his buddy ordered chicken dishes and they were cooked very well with great flavors.  The owners were so nice and personable, I like that level of customer service and it really makes a difference when it comes to choosing a restaurant. Overall a great experience and I'd definitely return.",

I didn't feel like making dinner that night and was craving falafel, so I looked on Yelp and found the 4 star review, one of the highest and closest to me. The pictures looked authentic and delicious. I should've stayed home and saved my money. It's a hole in the wall, which I ordinarily like and can be a good indication of authenticity. The 1 star is for an attempt at a restaurant. The atmosphere and service wasn't bad. The falafel though -- worst I've ever had. It's dried out and flavorless. I judge a Mediterranean place on how good their falafel is, and this was terrible. I hardly wanted to finish it but did because I was hungry. The server -- I think he was the owner -- recommended a red wine, and I sprang for it. It was almost skunked, so he clearly pushed it on me to get rid of it. Gross.",

I never have to twist my Mom's arm to dine here.  We both love the tomato bisque (\"to die for\"), although it's been two years since I've had it due to food allergies.  The hummus was good everytime we've gone, and I really like how it's served with wedges of tomatoes and a couple of cornichon (?) pickles.  We always ask for warm, toasted pitas.  Reading over the recent reviews, I wonder if management have switched to lower-quality ingredients?  The chicken kabobs are pretty tasty, as well, but do try their lamb shank dinners!  I'd skip the desserts here.  I do have two complaints: This venue ALWAYS reeks of sanitizer; at least on all four or five times we've visited.  It's a really huge turn-off.  Another is the surly service from the much older man.  I used to think it was just a culture difference, but now I just think he's not happy working there.  The restaurant could use a designer to spruce up the counter setting a bit.  As it stood a year ago, the entrance hallway looks more like an office in a decrepit building more than a space where customers wait to be seated and desserts are displayed.  On a postive note, the women's restroom was clean whenever I had to use it.",

The owner came to take our order, he advised us of the specials, one was lamb and one was chicken. I told him i wanted to order the falafel. He berated me about my choice and told me that i should have the chicken special. I stood my ground and said that I wanted falafel. He then stated that next time, hopefully i will make a better decision. My friend stated that she wanted the chicken Mediterranean, the owner argued with her until she said 'fine i will have the chicken special'. WOW! When our food came out, my falafel was good as usual. My friends \"chicken special\" was bland and rubbery. I think he was just trying to pawn off the pre-made special of the day.",

The older gentleman who served us had a lovely accent and demeanor, and he was very helpful with choosing appetizers and entrees. The decore is a little sparse I suppose, but the food makes up for it. We had the hummus and shish-kabobs that were delicious.

And i have to say Byblos is BY FAR,  The Best Middle Eastern Restaurant in Az...PERIOD.  Everything I've had so far was delicious. Oh wait, i can think of \"1 thing\" that wasn't good, their pita bread. Its obviously a store bought variety, and not freshly made. and kinda like eating cardboard...  However, everything else, mmmm, Love it. Try their... \"Hummus w/ Meat & pine\" its much tastier then the plain hummus... Their \"Tomato soup\" (to die for, & i dislike tomato soup, weird huh?)... Oh, and their Kibbe ... And the Shrimp scampi's pretty good too... Also a friend told me he loved the chicken Mediterranean (thou i haven't tried it)  So those are My top Fav's... You won't be disappointed.  i believe anyone who gave less than a 4 star rating to this exceptional restaurant, either never had middle eastern cuisine before, or does not have a sophisticated enough palette to be rating restaurants.",

Samir, the owner, took our order. We took his recommendations and ordered the lamb shank and the Mediterranean chicken. Both came with soup. The lentil was very good. The tomato soup was the BEST I have ever had!!! So creamy and flavorful. I grew up Catholic and had my share of tomato soup every Friday during Lent, so this is not a soup that I would normally order.  I could have eaten a gallon of it! The lamb shank was SO TENDER! It fell off the bone. And the chicken was delicious!  And then Samir brought us the pudding (on the house). We would never have ordered it (cakes & pies are our \"go to\" desserts) but will order it next time! It's made with rose water...a very creamy and light dessert.  Of course we couldn't help but order a few Lebanese beers and a shot of Ouzo.  We will for sure be going back! Derek & Gail",

We're vegetarian and there are some amazing choices for us, but their rudeness is intolerable. Service is hit or miss. If they are the least little bit busy, they all start running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They seriously lose it. We went in one night with two small (extremely well-behaved) children and they seated several parties before us, while continuing to say, \"Are you sure they like this kind of food? This is a quiet restaurant\" every time the owner came by, and when I said, \"Yes, they like your food, and actually we've been here many times,\" I got an eyeroll and another party seated before us. I guess I'm just past the point in my life where I'm able to deal with surly, rude service in order to have a good meal. We won't be back. If you decide to brave it, definitely try to soups, they're fantastic. As an aside, their parking lot is tiny. If you drive a bigger car or have trouble getting in and out of tight spaces, there is plenty of extra parking around the back. Lock your doors. It's creepy there at night.",

We placed our order very slowly as he couldn't write fast enough. My gf asked for a side of feta which turned into a bargaining situation, \"how much you pay for feta?\" Uhhhhhh.... $4 later we get a little Block of feta.

My friend and I were both looking for kebabs. Before we could even read a word on the menu, the owner approached and starts a long winded description of his four specials. We tell him we just want kebabs and hummus dip and asked him to locate it on the menu. He tells us not to order the kebabs, even though that it was our final decision, and pushes his most expensive lamb dish on us. He pressured and grilled us for a few minutes, and kept rudely discouraging us from ordering the hummus and the kebabs we tried to order. We almost just ordered the expensive lamb \"special\" to get him away. We knew what we wanted, why did he have such a problem with it.   We politely insisted that he place the order for what we were craving, kebabs. He was a bit annoyed at this point, and he proceeded to try to get me to upgrade my hummus to the beef hummus - but I just wanted plain. He didn't like my hesitation but he just finally let me order my plain hummus. A little while later, our dishes arrive. The meat was decent. The hummus I begged for was ok, but the pitas were dry and cold.   While eating, the owner comes up to the table and was being very rude to me when I tried to compliment the chicken. Bitter about me declining the special and ordering something cheaper perhaps? After 30 something years in business, you would think one would learn how to deal with customers. Hey I'm sure the guy means well, but Jesus, politely recommend something and move on - don't pound us into submission.   Overall, this was a troublesome experience and I will not be coming back.",

We entered into a rather large eating area with only a scattering of tables occupied.  We were seated right away and then the owner (older gentleman) came over to tell us that they were short staffed that evening.    My apprehension increased as we were going straight to the airport after dinner.    As others have mentioned the owner pulled a chair over to our table to tell us about the 4 lamb specials.  3 people ordered the lamb and rice special, someone had a chicken dish and I had the lamb gyro platter.  Each dish came with carrot soup which was tasty, but nothing special to write home about. But the lamb dishes were great.  And I loved my gyro dish.  It had more substantial meat than you get at the places that just slice the lamb of the skewer.  And the tzatziki sauce was thick and tangy.  Some people might be put off by the stark atmosphere, but if you want good food, I recommend giving this place a try.  I'd come back again.  It is hard to find good Mediterranean food places.",

The first time about a year ago I went during lunch time with a friend and was blown away by the service and entertainment (belly dancing). They also had a beautiful fish tank and great food.   This past week my experience was much more quiet as no one else was in the restaurant and they were about to close. They happily welcomed my girlfriend and I into their restaurant and provided outstanding service despite the proximity to closing time. The owner who is old and frail, took the time to sit down next to us and give us the specials and his opinions on all of the food to help us pick appropriately. I had the lamb and baklava for desert. Both were absolutely terrific. The fish tank was no longer there and no belly dancer but it did not change a thing for me.   I recommend for anyone considering a non-chain type restaurant, especially if you're looking for Non-American or Mediterranean food in particular.",

The owner and his wife are very friendly. He was very informative in explaining all the menu items and specials, and even recommended a Lebanese beer to try.  The appetizers came out quickly. We ordered the hummus to start which was made very well and had an addicting flavor. Their pita bread tasted a bit more authentic than most places and complimented the hummus.  The lentil soup that came with the meal was excellent, I wish it was larger because I could have eaten a huge bowl of it.  Soon after the appetizers the belly dancer started, she was very friendly and was very good at the same time. Even brought up the birthday girl to the front and danced with her.  Our food came out in adequate time. I ordered the combination kabob plate. All the meat was very tender and extremely juicy. The rice pilaf had amazing flavor and everyone at the table loved it.  At the end of the meal I ordered a cup of coffee which was pretty much the icing on the cake for me, and instantly made me a fan of this place.

We walked in and from the first moment, we felt we were at the right place.   Beautiful people, we knew a few of the tables.    The menu us very friendly, every single dish sounded provocative.  The bread with truffles was fantastic, the eggplant dumplings were airy, light, delicious dressing, crunchy on the outside.  The tomato salad was delicious. A little bit small but nicely accomplished.   Now, the branzino was the best fish I have ever had. Perfect texture, perfectly cooked, the meat was greasy and tender, just perfect.   We had many other plates, all great, but then dessert came.  I must say, after more than 20 years having had pastry shops, this chocolate hazelnut mousse was perfection.   The mix of french techniques with Lebanese influence was sublime.     The waiter, son of an american and cuban parents, was one of the best ever.   The price, worth every dollar!!!",

Constantly asking us about their special of the day, when we told him upfront that we weren't interested. He even told us to leave the menu insert inside the menu book (and not in a friendly voice either).  I've never experienced anything like that in my life.  Lastly, I ordered the combination grilled meat.  The beef, chicken and lamb were all dry.  I prefer my meat moist.  I've tried various restaurants serving Mediterranean cuisine but can say that this was my least favorite.  It's unfortunate because what brought me here were all the glorious reviews.",

    "text": "Byblos has been in business since 1984 in Tempe.  They obviously know what they are doing and are doing something right. I just don't get how some people rate it one star .  Unreal!  We came for dinner there as a group (23 guests).   The staff was fantastic!  We all ordered different dishes. Byblos cleverly served us by section so that none of us felt left out while others were already served.  They put our tables in a U shape. Very smart!  Let's talk food now.  We had a few appetizers on each table to munch on while our dishes were getting prepared.  We had authentic hummus, very smooth, perfect balance of garlic, salt, lemon, tahini... I had a vegetarian sampler, with stuffed grape leaves, babaghanoush, green beans, tabouli, Lebane,  falafel. It was outstanding, l really appreciated the smoky flavor of the babaganoush.  I asked my friends around how were their dishes, they all raved about the food!  Lots of lamb dishes were ordered and truly appreciated by all.  The beef stroganoff was also a hit.  I had their honey pudding dessert. It was very refreshing! It was  topped with ground pistachios and a honey glaze, a hint of rose water to appease my senses after this wonderful feast. The pudding itself is sweet but not too much, it has some rice in it, just enough to give it some texture. Byblos prices are fair, food is tasty and plentiful. Nice and friendly people were attentive to all our needs. They exceeded our expectations!",

They have been here in the same place for the past 25 years. The owners were really friendly and they let us know about the daily specials they have. We had the choice of a tender over roasted belly of the lamb that has been roasting for 15 hours (The lamb platter) or the lamb shank. We had both. The lamb shank was delicious. The lamb platter was the star of the night. The lamb meat was perfectly cooked, tender and full of flavor. It leaves you asking for more. Also, I never had tomato soup tasting so creamy and tasty.  We will definitely be back.",

Sadly, my efforts proved fruitless.  Was it something I said?  Was it the way I parked my car?  My choice of hat, perhaps?

We all were seated and handed menus and the owner was giving us a very detailed list of the specials they had going, and was even ready to take our order right then and there, but we told him we needed a few more minutes, so he said he would be back in 5, and he was.   I already knew what I wanted, I ordered the Falafel Sandwich, it came with soup & fries. There as 2 choices of soup, lentil and tomato or as the owner put it, fight for or die for. I went with the Lentil soup, I love lentil soup but after the order was placed he came back and apologized for the mistake and it was chicken noodle soup or tomato, so now I went with tomato soup.  He said it was to die for! Well let tell yall, that tomato soup was creamy, full of flavor and well maybe it was to die for! I'm not much of a soup person but I could see me having a nice warm bowl of that on a cold day.   The falafel wrap was good to, I had been craving falafel and this hit the spot.

Went with my mom and we each started with the soup of the day - lentil - which was creamy and flavorful. It came to the tank at the proper temperature which is important to me with soup. I HAD to try their tzatziki so I ordered a gyro plate (boring, I know) but the lamb was absolutely amazing and very flavorful. The fresh pita was warm and fluffy and I also loved the taboule on the side. The tzatziki, while fresh tasting, is not the best I've ever had. It was good though. My dish also had rice pilaf on the side which I found to be a bit bland but my mom enjoyed it.   My mom got the special of the day - slow cooked lamb shank. It literally fell off of the bone. She loved it and also enjoyed her fresh pita and grilled veggie medley that came with the dinner. She did not like her rice, but I loved it so we traded. Hers was a mixture of rice, pine nuts, and ground beef. Great!  Would go here again if I was in the area. Place is very cute inside. Only negative for me for the waiter/possibly owner who stood next to the table while we counted our money for the bill and discussed the tip. Very rude and not appreciated. Otherwise a good experience.",

Years ago I went there on my wedding anniversary--we were both in the mood for Mediterranean food. After we were seated, no one waited on us. After about 15 minutes, we got up and left. (Maybe servers were confused about in whose section we had been seated.) Years later, I went to lunch there with some friends. Everything was fine this time around, but I had to explain to my companions why I had chosen not to eat there for years. It's been over a year now since that lunch, but I need to go back because the food is delicious. That incident many years ago was, I'm sure, a fluke. However, that one time of bad \"service\" left a bad taste in my mouth (and tells a story about the importance of pleasing the customer). Honestly, though, the food won't hurt your feelings.

Also, you can't go wrong with the Gyro pita wrap. The Greek salad combo is a nice lunch choice too. As for sweet endings well I'm not the best to ask because I'm Italian so I'm going for the Tiramisu.Yummy!  My advice it's worth checking out!",

It came with rice and pita and onions. Okay but nothing special.  My son had the lamb shank which was good but small in size.  The tomato soup was lovely but the lentil soup was not to my taste.  We had baklava and honey pudding for dessert.  Neither was very good,  both seemed as though they may have been hanging around for a while.  I aked if all of the desserts are made in house and was told that they were.  There were several desserts such as Kentucky bourbon pecan pie and tiramisu that were obviously not house made.  Not bad but I would try a different restaurant next time.",

    "text": "Being half Armenian, I am a bit more critical when reviewing other Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food from the same region. Having been in the PHX area for the last 9 years, it's kind of sad that it has taken me almost a decade to discover Byblos. Here is the rundown:  What they do well: 1. Best chicken kabob's I've had in Arizona. 2. One of the only Middle Eastern/Near East restaurants in Arizona that I've found that serves rice pilaf. 3. Homemade tomato soup was excellent! Simple, yet rich and creamy. 4. They put the pita bread on the grill to give it a nice smoky, slightly burnt and crunchy taste...trust me, it's really good. 5. The hummus was blended very well...smooth, with no chunks of garbanzo. 6. The lentil soup was broth based and had a lite and pleasant taste.  Critiques: 1. The keufta kabob was a bit dry on the inside and the seasoning (specifically the parsley) didn't really bind and mix well with the meat...probably just a one-off. 2. The tzatziki wasn't bad, it just tasted a bit plain, like it was missing something...cucumber, dill or mint, perhaps. 3. The belly dancer was a nice touch, but the music volume was so low and had so much distorted bass, it was kind of hard to enjoy the show.  Tips: The parking lot is a bit small, but there is another lot in the rear and some street parking as well.  I absolutely love little mom and pop places like this and will definitely go back soon!",

While it can be a little busy some nights and the service can slow down a bit don't let it deter you one bit. You definitely feel like you are warmly welcomed. Even while waiting you will have the fun entertainment of a live belly dancer if you go on Saturdays who visits each table for the guests. Then the food arrives and the enjoyment continues. I highly suggest the dolma entree and the falafel plate. And whatever you do order the tomato soup it's amazing!!!!!! This place is always delicious and well worth the higher prices. If you like excellent Greek food come here!!!",

So good!  Didn't have the dessert. Maybe next time.  Here is my advice, time the dishes better. Serve the women first, I guess I am a little old school but it's the details. The food was 10 stars!

It is very conveniently located in Tempe, and while we ended up ordering our food to-go, the inside of the restaurant was clean, nicely decorated, and quite spacious.  I also really liked the fact that there was a table of older gentlemen having what appeared to be a lively meal, but they welcomed us as soon as we entered the restaurant - it really made the place feel like a family environment :)  As for the food, their portions are generous, and so delicious!  I loved everything I got to taste, and my SO said that thier's was the best lamb he'd had in Arizona so far, which is pretty high praise considering he is constantly on the hunt for lamb shank wherever he goes!  If you're in the mood for a nice sit-down meal, or just want to eat at home, definitely consider Byblos Restaurant - they're fast, friendly and most importantly, have great Mediterranean food!!",

The soups were the best part of the meal. The tomato soup had the most eye opening flavor combo, I wish my Mom had made it like this when I was growing up.  We ended up trying the mixed meat special. It had a chicken kabob, beef kabob, and some lamb. The chicken was hands down the best of the three. It was only mildly over cooked. The beef had a tough texture and tasted mildly of funk. The lamb was flavorless. Even soaking it in cucumber sauce couldn't save it. I used the rice to cleanse my palate. The rest of the customers were repeat visitors and were excited for their meals. I've had better Greek food at my local festivals.",

Matthew got falafel, which i hate, but he said it was fantastic. it came with lentil soup, which was terribly comforting, although unfamiliar territory for me. it was a wonderful discovery,    they just finished remodeling, so i think it may be time to go and dine in. i'm excited.",

I thought the food was great, a bit much at $12.95, but did not disappoint. When I came in to pick up the order, I did notice the place seemed extremely quiet. I wonder why? I don't get too eccentric with my middle eastern tastes, but Shawarma is a great dish, chicken or beef. An interesting note: Al Pastor tacos, come from this Mediterranean dish. I need to look up the history of this connection.",

I've also had their moussaka and was impressed as well as the shawarma beef which was excellently seasoned and marinated. You won't be disappointed but look beyond the surface on this one.

    "text": "Byblos is a run-of-the-mill Mediterranean restaurant in desperate need of a facelift!  With a hit-and-miss menu and tall asking prices, it's obvious that Byblos still has much to learn after nearly 28 years in business!    The restaurant itself is well dated and the atmosphere inside generally feels like a retirement home lobby with booths for seating...booths that are very worn and borderline uncomfortable.  While the decor could use a serious smack with the pretty stick, the smaller size of the restaurant does make it fairly cozy for family dinners and small gatherings.    The older lady and gentleman that run the place are pleasant and good natured, but can be difficult to understand.  Obviously, this has caused several of the negative reviews, but their heavy accents do add something to the experience beyond just the obvious confusion.  One thing worth noting is that they are their own waitstaff and they clearly don't move as quickly as they used to, so service can be a bit slow if there are more than 3 or 4 tables to tend to.    On the plus side, it's easy to get prime seating on both Friday and Saturday night, because it's rarely a full house!  It's also one of the few places left in the area where you can enjoy free, live Belly Dancing during dinner on the weekends, so I give them props for supporting local talent!  Regarding the food, I will say that the lamb dishes are tasty, the complimentary mint tea is exceptionally relaxing and the soups have a genuine down-home taste to them.  However, most of the main entree items are no more than food truck quality pitas and state fair combo plates sold at a premium price.  The quality of the main ingredients just isn't there and a quick trip to the frozen food aisle at Costco would net you most of the supplies needed to start your very own \"Byblos\" franchise at home!  The desserts are tasty, but few are traditional and none of them, except maybe the baklava, appear to be made by the restaurant.  Also, the bar is limited and the wine selection is nothing short of dreary, though that doesn't stop them from asking fine dining prices on grocery store brands of alcohol.  While there's no real \"value\" in the Byblos experience, it's certainly a solid choice when you're just too tired on a Friday evening to drive somewhere else or the inlaws you hate happen to be in town and you absolutely \"must\" take them out!",

    "text": "Two things seemed to stand out  when I read the reviews of this place before dining here: good food, but less-than-stellar service. And that's pretty much what I experienced when I had dinner here with friends. We weren't sure how many would be in our group, but eight of us had arrived and two small square tables had been joined together for us - a good fit for six people, but a tight and only marginally acceptable fit for our party of eight. When another person called and said she would be joining, we requested that an adjoining small table be added to our joint tables, which would have also eased up our cramped arrangement. Instead, the dour old man mentioned in the other reviews grouchily insisted on just adding another setting to one end of the grouped tables, forcing two people to squeeze into that small space. This is extremely unreasonable given that all the tables around our party were empty and remained so for the time we were there; in fact, very few other people were dining in the restaurant that evening. The gentleman who took our order was a lot more friendly but gave us a strange high-pressure sales pitch for some dishes, as Jenny R. had warned in her review. I had given my order for keufta khachkach, but he kept pushing the beef stroganoff, saying that they may not have enough ingredients for my order (... huh!?) He desisted when I told him I can't have a cream-based dish (actually I can; I just didn't want another dish being pushed on me). It turned out they did have enough ingredients for my dish after all ... how 'bout that!  I must say that the food was good, and reasonably priced for the quality and quantity. And everyone in the party agreed about the quality of the food they got.  My rating for the food alone: four and a half stars; for the service alone, one and a half stars; therefore, a 3-star average. If you plan to dine here, expect good food as a reward for your putting up with the service that tries your patience.",

    "text": "Summary for A.D.H.D readers:  * Tomato soup is the best I have ever had * The restaurant was lonely and located in a shady area * The server was very kind, but a little pushy on insisting drinks and dessert * The gyro meat was a little too greasy for my taste, but everything else tasted fresh * Fast service, clean tables, and authentic Greek music playing * Prices range from $12+ for entrees, but they are large portions and come with soup  Full Review:  Yes, the tomato soup is the best I've ever had.  The restaurant is located in a shady area, but I was not too intimidated since it was right on the side of the street and well-lit.  Upon entering, I was shocked that there weren't more people eating there. In fact, we were the only ones in there. We waited around awkwardly until someone sat us and then we were greeted by a 75+ year old server, who I assume is one of the owners.  We ordered tomato soup, a gyro plate, diet pepsi, and baklavas for dessert. It didn't seem like business was going too well. The server was a little pushy on the up-sells (the drink and the dessert).   The soda was in a smaller cup than I am used to. While we waited for food, we also took sips of the water, which was pretty good.   The soup arrived in less than 3-5 minutes. I originally ordered the lentil soup, but was very happy they brought me tomato instead. I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the best tomato soup I have ever tasted in my life. Lots of flavor and smelled amazing. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, our food plates arrived and it looked delicious.   The pita bread was plenty and they were all warm. I like my pita bread warm and soft. This pita bread was on point. To be honest, the gyro meat strips were a little too greasy for my liking, but they tasted GREAT dipped into the tomato soup.  The rice was well cooked and a great compliment to the tzatziki sauce, which was tangy and refreshing. After we devoured our meal, we felt more than stuffed. But, the waiter insisted we have dessert and even coffee. We agreed on getting baklavas for dessert. We passed on the coffee.  The baklavas were $2.50 each, were smaller than usual, but were overall pretty good. I'm not too sure they were made on location though. I recommend it for those looking for an authentic Greek food experience that have the time and budget for more than a fast food Greek experience.",

The restaurant decor is unassuming and  very comfortable.  The place is run by the owner and his sister who attended to our every need.  When were were deciding what to order, the owner told us all about his top three.  The one at the top was a lamb dish.  I am not a lamb fan but he said it was \"THE BEST IN THE UNIVERSE!\"  I ordered it and I was not disappointed.  It was nothing short of amazing!!!  The tomato soup and the carrot cake, homemade by the sister, was incredible.  This was such a great dining experience not only for the food but for the humble and welcoming owners.  I would highly recommend that you chose this restaurant on Mill Ave. in Tempe.  You will not regret it.",

I've eaten here quite a few times over the years and have had nothing but impeccable service from the man and woman who are always there, I believe they are the owners.  I've usually been thanked before my meal is through multiple times, they really appreciate the customers they have.  They do like to highlight their lamb dishes, and say that they are on special but they are pretty much always being served and they are all crazy good.  If you want to have a great meal, here is what I recommend.  The hummus with pine nuts.  Follow that up with the mousakka or lamb shank.  Get the tomato soup that everyone raves about...my buddy and I both have agreed multiple times that it's hands-down the best tomato soup we've had.  If you are still hungry after all of that....their baklava and coffee are great to end on.

We have come here countless times, and every time we are greeting lovingly. They treat all their customers with care; stopping by and checking if things are okay. The service can be a bit slow at times, but the brother and sister and always running back and forth from the kitchen, and the table cleaner works very hard, is super friendly, and helps out the owners when they are busy.  I don't think we've had anything from the menu that has disappointed us. The hummus, babaghannouj, fool (LOVE it), and tabouli (taboule) are all amazing to start with or have as sides. Scratch that... all of the appetizers are homemade and delicious. You could make a meal out of all the starters.  Be sure to get some lentil soup with your entree (can be a tad salty sometimes), and if they have some homemade dessert, make sure to end your visit with some baklava.  The lamb kebabs we always get; you get a ton of food in each entree, including rice and hummus (if you don't like a lot of olive oil make sure to ask for hummus and babaghannouj to be served without olive oil drizzled on top).  For a good sampling, get a bunch of appetizers to split (vegetarian combo platter is a good place to start), and for the entree the Byblos Mixed grill offers lamb, chicken, and keufta (ground and spiced meat) kabobs.  Despite coming here so many times, we still have many things we want to try. The problem is wanting to get the same delicious meals we got the previous visit instead of trying new ones!  Byblos will not disappoint! I would recommend calling ahead to make sure they are open. Lunch and dinner are served, but Tuesday through Saturday they close at 3:30pm and reopen for dinner service at 5:00pm. They are closed Mondays, serve dinner only on Sundays, and usually have a week or two in July/August when they close for vacation.",
