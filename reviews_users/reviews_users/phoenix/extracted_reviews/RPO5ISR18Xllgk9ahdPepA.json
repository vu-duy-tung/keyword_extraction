On our second visit, our server, who was very nice, was rarely at our table. I think he must have had tables on the opposite side of the restaurant as he only showed up to take orders, drop off drinks and food, and close with desserts. It took almost 10 minutes for our drinks- one Old Fashioned and a beer.   I was so looking forward to the Scotch Beef but when it came it was extremely dry with barely any sauce to be found. As our server was constantly absent, I ate what I could with water and gave up halfway through. Bummer.   Other than that- it was a decent evening. We ended dinner with the salted chocolate volcano cake which I thought was absolutely horrid but my husband loved it.   I think we will consider returning at another time- but I might give other restaurants a try until the memory of choking on dry pot roast fades. :)",

    "text": "This place is superb. Worth every dollar spent.   Went on Christmas Eve and it was packed. Waited about 10 minutes after our reservation time.   Ordered a bottle of wine which they were out of and the waiter suggests  a CHEAPER wine that he thought was just as good. Who does that? That is to be commended! Well, it was very good and a great way to start the meal.  Apps were mussels and about the best beef carpaccio ever. Sauce for the mussels was perfect and they gave us plenty of bread to mop it all up.  Main courses of Steak with Pepper; Scallops and the winner.....Ribbon pasta with chicken sausage. That dish has great flavor and balance.   Dessert is a must. About the best cheesecake I can remember having. It is not your traditional NY style. It is a tall cylinder of extremely light cheese cake with a caramel sauce.   Hope to get to Scottsdale again so I can return for another meal.",

Our waiter couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  I remember loving this place a few years ago but I just didn't think the cuisine was very good this time and I know it has an excellent reputation.  My daughter had the popcorn shrimp but the sauce was a tad pasty.  I had the burrata and tomatoes but the burrata was just too runny.  I know burrata is supposed to be a bit runny but this was too mushy as were the tomatoes.  The biggest disappointment for me was the sole and the NY Strip.  The meat was tough and not flavorful and the fish tasted more like sea bass than sole.  I know this is a harsh review but there is no way to I could put this cuisine in the same category as The Mission, Elements, Roka Akor or Cafe Monarch.  This is not a contemptuous restaurant but I just wish I had loved the food more.",

    "text": "Amazing decor with a modern and intimate feel. We were in town and decided to try a nice place for wine and dessert, had a glass of red zinfandel (fruitful and easy to drink) and my boyfriend had the vanilla porter (thick body and True to it's name) and a glass of Malbec ( tasty and extremely smooth, definitely suggested).   As we were trying to decide what to have for dessert, the manager came by and introduced himself, very friendly staff, and soon after we had a rosemary caramel cheesecake on the house! The rosemary caramel sauce was thick and tasty but not overwhelmingly sweet at all, the cheesecake itself was thick and creamy, and the crust was perfectly baked, we LOVED it.   since the dessert was so good, we figured why not try out their steak. We shared a steak medium rare which came out split for us without even having to request it to be split. There's a glaze around the steak that we couldn't figure out what it was exactly, but complimented the steak perfectly. Very tender and perfectly cooked. Side of mashed potatoes were well mashed and not runny at all, gravy is by request and has a charred, oak taste to it, delicious.   Overall, we loved it! Will definitely be back next time we pass by Phoenix AZ",

There is an intimate dining area and a bar area so you can choose what you are in the mood for.  We were greeted and seated immediately in the dining area.  Our server, Audrey,  was fantastic. I noticed they have a nice wine selection, although I did not have a glass. They offer poutine and we could not turn down the temptation, so we had to start with that.  It was delicious! I wasn't thrilled when I saw how skinny the fries were but the taste was excellent. The menu offers an inviting selection of items and they offer daily specials.  We chose the salmon and the chicken.  The salmon had a sweet sauce which I liked and it was served on a bed of lettuce. The chicken was done perfectly and came with a side of creamy mashed potatoes that will make you want to have them every day.  Refills on waters were prompt and plates were cleared right away. My only regrets are not trying the scotch beef and not being hungry enough for what looked like some fabulous desserts. Guess we have to go back.",

Reservations can be challenging even though its been around for years, has no view, parking is tight and is located in a strip mall. It's that good. The food is fresh, and perfectly prepared -- every time. Service is attentive. Mr. Tarbell may stop by your table and help with menu suggestions. The ribbon pasta is a signature dish with house made pasta. The strip steak is fabulous. The fish of the moment is always great. The \"beyond prime\" beef carpaccio  is exotic, rich and tasty as an appetizer. The wine list is off the charts with bottles ranging from about $50 to $5,000. I was there once as a guest on an expense account dinner and the $2,500 bottles were poured. It was fun to watch and Tarbell's is a place that knows how to handle big spenders. For dessert, the creme brulee is my favorite. I probably go there once a month and have never been disappointed.",

    "text": "There are so many great restaurants in Central Phoenix, that I expect good food when I go to a place like Tarbell's!  This was our first time there and we were celebrating our 24th anniversary with another couple. We definitely made the right choice for our celebration.  We had a couple of cocktails before we came to the restaurant, and we were in a festive mood. Our waiter, Nathan, picked up on the vibe right away, and was a great sport, as well as a great server. We were in the mood to try different items, and he was very accommodating. We started with the Candied Bacon, and we all split a Beet salad (they split it and it came out beautifully presented).  Dinner was more of the same. We each had an entree, and it was hard to decide what to order. Nathan actually brought two sample bowls of food we didn't order, just for us to try, since we had struggled in choosing. The mussels and the scallops were crazy good! The mussels were the creamiest I may have ever eaten, and a terrific size! The squid ink pasta and gnocchi were both made in house and were terrific!  The spaghetti and meatballs should be labeled, \"huge delicious meatball (1) and spaghetti.\"  Again, it was awesome. The meatball was made from multiple meats, was fresh from the oven, and had a taste that was terrific.  The wine list is plentiful and provides a great deal of variety, but doesn't feel overwhelming.  We chose a couple of mid priced blends, that they priced at reasonable restaurant rates.  The food, along with Nathan's great service made this a night to remember.",

The positives---the staff was really exceptional. They were super friendly and attentive. I also loved the roasted (deep fried?) chick peas that were on the table as a starter. They were super delicious. Also, our main proteins (husband had steak, I had the scallops) were cooked technically well and the presentation was very nice. My scallop plate was probably the prettiest plate of food I've been served.   However, the flavors were just not that great. My entree lacked salt/savory flavors, and the root vegetables on my plate were not cooked long enough, so they were quite tough. My husband said his steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, but the flavor just wasn't special or memorable. He ordered a side of brussels sprouts, which was actually his favorite part of the dinner. Overall, the food was just OK. I had expected the food to be 5 stars, but in reality, I've eaten at many many better restaurants.  Nothing about Tarbell's was memorable. The decor and the vibe was not cool or unique. The majority of the patrons were elderly. We definitely would not go back there.  P.S. I ate at Tarbell's Tavern (next door, more of a bar menu) a couple weeks ago, and I liked their food and atmosphere better than Tarbell's.",

Nice wine selection and cocktails are well made.  The service seems to be hit and miss.  I have been there twice and the first time, the service was great.  The second time it was very poor.  The food is a bit of an anomaly to me.  It is very flavorful and presented well.  However, all the dishes I have tried have been so rich and heavy, that I have regretted eating them afterwards.  I felt full and uncomfortable for hours after going to Tarbell's.  Maybe this is just a personal preference, but I have been to France, where rich food is a staple and this seems even more over the top than any of the places I have tried there.  The handmade pasta was swimming in a pool of butter and the red wine gravy for the scotch beef nearly coagulated because there was so much butter and sugar in it.  I'm all for good taste, but I am not a fan.",

The wine list is extensive and they carry several unique beers, which is always a bonus. We started with mac and cheese - divine. The cheese was sharp and the noodles were firm. We had oysters as well, extremely fresh and cold, perfect. Our server was very friendly and helpful. I really wanted a NY strip, but it's served with creamed spinach, which I don't care for. Our waiter suggested subbing the sides from the chicken dish. I know that seems simple but some places don't substitute - I guess some chefs know better than the guests. Husband had scallops and said they were fabulous. We ordered dessert, which came out with Happy Anniversary written on the plate, which I thought was ultra cool since I only made a reference to that on the online reservation - we never told anyone personally. How thoughtful! Husband said the cheesecake was creamy and thick, exactly right (not a cheesecake fan so I'll trust him). I am, however, a bread pudding fan. Their bread pudding was ok. I found it to be too dry, not enough custard. The flavor was quite nice though. Overall, this was a romantic and delicious dinner, thank you to everyone at Tarbell's!",

The beef dish with the buttermilk mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth delish! The ice cream cream puff dessert was good, but not to die for. My friend and I stopped by after going to a kids soccer game and we were a bit underdressed. The wait staff was friendly and it wasn't  problem.",

The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulee was delicious (though we couldn't taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulee). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. We're from MA, and were unaware of the chef's celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? I'm outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: It's a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Under 2 miles.",

Its just very fresh, made well with great ingredients. The scotch beef was fab as was the chocolate cake. The service was decent even though they were busy. It was hard because the tables are so close to each other, but it worked out ok. Def worth a try, but I would warn them that there are a few things they could work on, food isn't one of them.

    "text": "In our family, we have two birthdays around the holidays, so I had the chance to review two restaurants in two days, both for fine meals. On my son's birthday, the three of us went to Southern Rail, and the next night, to celebrate my wife's birthday we went to Tarbell's. Both were good in the food department. I'm giving Tarbell's a lower rating because of the terrible service we had that night -- and because it compared so terribly with the service we had at Southern Rail the night before. The food was not bad -- in fact, when the owner came by we were enjoying a terrific appetizer of roasted beets and it seemed to indicate a great meal was coming up. But then, things began to deteriorate as the night went on. We had an early reservation (6:30) and things were fine till our waiter had larger tables on either side of us. While this guy was taking care of his larger checks, we were neglected to the point that we never received a birthday treat for my wife (which was absolutely huge at Southern Rail), and to the point where we actually had to get up and flag the guy down to get our bill. Really, just quite poor service. It appears after our Tarbell's experience that any restaurant, even one with good fare, needs to review how the wait staff deals with smaller tables when those guests are sandwiched in between larger groups. [Hey, Mark -- I spent $150, aren't I entitled to a waiter when I need one?] For my money, I'll take Southern Rail. While the environment is not as sophisticated, the large plates of delicious food were simply outstanding and our waiter cared a great deal about ensuring our satisfaction. We hope that on our next visit to Tarbell's we'll receive a bit more attention.",

Carin and split a Caesar salad (I think that's becoming a theme with us, but the Caeser here is pretty good, with anchovies on request). I had the salmon, which I hadn't had before, and it was good (I don't usually get seafood in Phoenix...even Salt Cellar, Wildlfish, Ocean Club, etc., don't really measure up to Portland, Seattle and SFO, where I spent so much of my misspent youth). Carin had the pan-roasted chicken, which is also quite good. On previous visits I have had the mustard Pork Chop (which I can also recommend) and the Cheese burger (which isn't as good as others in the area. Add a couple of glasses of Syrah and it was a very pleasant dinner.  The service was good (attentive but not intrusive or rushed) and while not cheap at $100 for 2, it's not the priciest by a good big margin, and well worth it! I think of Tarbells when I want something that's comfortable but upscale and a little bit different (not just another steak or grilled Chilean Sea Bass with some kind of glaze). Mark Tarbell has thought this place out pretty well, and it's a very appealing spot.",

Therefore, I was looking for a place we could get a hearty cut of meat. I found Tarbell's on Yelp and saw the photos of that huge pork chop.  The photo, along with the favorable reviews led me to my decision to make reservations.  However, I was very disappointed that they no longer have the pork chop on the menu.  We had reservations at 8:30, but got there around 7:45 to have a drink and watch the Cal Poly basketball game. The bartender was very nice and knowledgeable on their wines. He provided us with a sample of a Cab, which my dad later got with his meal.  While having a drink, the couple next to us was brought a beautiful dish of 5 huge diver scallops. My father and I decided that we would get an order of the scallops and a meat dish to split. We started with a salad that had uncooked butternut squash and fried parsnips. The butternut squash was surprisingly good. It was cut thin so it was not overly crunchy, as I had assumed uncooked butternut would be. The salad had a homemade parsnip vinagerette that was light refreshing and wonderful. The scallops were to die for, by far the best I have ever had. They came on top of mushroom risotto that was also excellent. Unfortunately though the Tar's Scotch Beef was pretty bland. The meat was under seasoned and not very good unless mixed with the mashed potatoes and red wine gravy to make it flavorful. All in all a very good meal...I still wish I could've had the pork chop though.",

When we made our reservation we made sure to let them know it was our anniversary and to please accommodate us with an out of the way table. When we arrived we were informed that they were running late and it would be 20 minutes until they could seat us. We sat at the bar and the bar staff was great. They were super busy but we got quick service and good cocktails. After about 20 minutes the hostess came to seat us but they didn't have any tables in the dinner room and she sat us in the bar and right next to the door.   It was super packed and loud, which would have been fine for hanging out at happy hour but not so much for what was supposed to be a romantic anniversary dinner.  We ordered muscles and oddly some tasted very minerally and others very creamy and mushy.  There was nothing wrong with the scallops but also nothing very memorable. We also had the Bolognese which sounded like it was going to be amazing but the spice they put in it really drowns out the other flavors. The pasta with it was cooked perfectly.   The support staff was great. Every person who delivered food to us was able to knowledgeably answer questions about the dishes and wine pairings  I might consider coming back here for a drink at the bar but I wouldn't eat here again.",

Oh wait-- he actually is an Iron Chef winner and I really did see him on the Food Network ...  The restaurant is beautiful, from the moment you walk in. It isn't too big so there is generally a lot of intimacy at your table. An amazing wine selection, some affordable and some extremely expensive and high-quality.  Every employee from the manager to the hostess to the server is clean and articulate and knowledgeable about the menu.   They have interesting things on the menu that I just don't see that often. I haven't necessarily liked every single thing I've had (duck sausage) but I have tried a lot of new things by eating here that are not even available elsewhere. I mean... When was last time you saw duck sausage on a menu?  Some of my favorites on the menu include their prime rib, New York strip, risotto, the salmon, the beet salad, and the seasonal vegetable plate. Their menu, at least part of it, changes with the seasons so everything you get is fresh and tasty.  So, it is Cheffy and upscale, and maybe not a place you would go to every week or even every month. But you'll have a great experience and it won't break the bank even if it will be a little bit pricey.",

The mushroom risotto was probably the best of the dishes. I also appreciated that the wine list gave some love to non-pinot/cab reds and was not overpriced any more  than expected.

However, every member of our party thought the food just average. The dishes worthy of change include: - the salmon. I had it and it was way below average. Essentially, it's a piece of salmon with a nice sweet glaze, with some greens sitting on a bed of over-fried hash browns. The hash brown thing was just odd. - the beet salad - roasted beets in a sauce with arugula. Nothing delicate about this dish - a large quantity of beets chopped in a nondescript sauce.  - The steak - a hunk of beef with some greens/chard and a scallop potato cake. Our guest declared it good.  Overall, quite disappointing. Restaurant was full, service was excellent. I've been when it was better.",

So finally, four years ago, we made it, and there is no looking back. For us, Tarbell's has gone from this \"special event\" destination restaurant, to \"hey it's mid-week and were nearby so let's grab a quick dinner\". Sure it still is a special place (we went for date night last weekend) but it's so very accessible, friendly, and welcoming that it's hard not to want to come here any day of the week. The bar staff is uber talented with very solid spins on classics, excellent back bar particularly the brown spirit selections, the wine list has hidden affordable gems (like the Wind Gap chard we had last weekend) and its share of rare bottles as well, the wait staff is always knowledgeable and friendly, no pretension here, and the food is top-notch. I don't know of any kitchen in PHX that is doing sauces as good as this place. Proteins are always cooked just so, and the accompaniments always compliment. Love this place.",

    "text": "My wife and I had dinner at Tarbell's at 7:15pm on July 21st.  My first impression was that it was noisy; it was a Saturday night and they were busy.  I had expected something a little more laid back and romantic.  This was definitely not the time nor the day for the quiet romantic dinner. We started with the Tuna Tartar appetizer which was delicious.  I had the Tenderloin with Lump Crab which came on a bed of mashed potatoes accompanied by grilled and carmelized carrots.  The Tenderloin was cooked perfectly (extremely rare) and had great flavor; a very nice piece of meat.  The Lump Crab was very good also, but I felt it was over-kill and really didn't accompany the Tenderloin well.  My wife had the Lobster Gnocci which she said was excellent.  We didn't have dessert, even though I was tempted by the peach crisp.  Tarbell's is an excellent restaurant; when we return, it will be at an early hour and during the week.",

The bartender was very good, attentive and made a fantastic Old Fashioned.     After a drink we were asked to be seated at a table for dinner.  Our waiter (Drew) was friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and did a good job making the specials sound very appetizing.   My wife enjoyed the Halibut (Special of the day) it was large portion, beautifully presented and perfectly cooked.  I had the Scotch Steak which was an upscale Pot Roast but it was excellent.   The Manager, Seth, stopped by to see how everything was and we talked bourbon for a bit.   I was very impressed with the Tarbell's Elijah Craig private barrel.   Desserts of Chocolate Cake with Pistachio Gelato and Ganache and The Beloved Chocolate Mousse with Fair-Trade Chocolate were well presented and topped off a wonderful night.   Overall we were impressed with the staff and food and look forward to returning.",

Allan our waiter was just wonderful and saw to all our needs. The calamari was tender and not over breaded or fried. Just perfect and melted in your mouth.

The shishito peppers didn't have the expected char and if they used any seasoning you wouldn't know it.  First two selections from wine list list were out of stock.  Maybe it is Scottsdale but a shockingly small selection of wine under $100 and most from the Cabernets were not well known.   Pardon me but a wedge salad is a wedge of iceberg not other lettuce  piled  up which this was. The candied bacon was so hard as to be inedible.    There two paper thin slices of tomato.  All in all not just overpriced but a poor value with mediocre food at best",

    "text": "Sis and b-I-l were passing through town on a short vacation. Searched Yelp for a great place for food and conversation. Tarbell's was the right choice.  We started off sharing a bacon soft boiled egg appetizer which was quickly devoured. Three of our party chose to order scallops and I was the odd person out and ordered Mr Fish of the day. I was served a delicious portion of halibut. All dinners were served with a corn couscous and mixed vegetables. Hubby declared his dish the best scallops he has ever eaten. For a man who thinks \"it was okay\" is high praise saying the best ever is momentous. I expected the heavens to open up or the earth to shake!  We each ordered a different dessert: vanilla cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce, chocolate molten cake with salted caramel sauce, creme brulee, and chocolate mousse. No one shared their dessert. They were that good!  We arrived just as the restaurant opened. Our server, Nathan, greeted us and we knew he was going to be a \"good fit\" with our party. He was as attentive to our table as he was personable. Nathan wasn't afraid to give recommendations and he was spot on. There were two young gentlemen assisting Nathan who were cheery and helpful. A great server is a key part of a great experience and Tarbell's knocked out of the park with these three.  All in all we were the table that enjoyed their food, appreciated their server, and probably laughed a little too often and a little too loud.  Our tab for appetizer, two rounds of drinks, entrees and dessert came to $290 with tax and before tip.   A great dining experience that I recommend you try.",

We've driven by this place a few times and after reading the Yelp reviews, we decided we had to try it. I am so glad we did! We arrived around 7pm on a Tuesday evening. They asked if we had a reservation and we didn't, but luckily one table was open and we were sat immediately. Our server, Jillian I think, arrived promptly and boy was she energetic! Super friendly and helpful. She gave us some time to ponder the menu and while we did, fresh bread and olive oil arrived. For starters, we ordered the Brussels sprouts. For our main entrees, I ordered the house-made ribbon pasta and my husband ordered Tar's scotch beef. Jillian commented on our 'good choices' and placed the order. It arrived super quickly and OMG. Taste explosion! My pasta's sauce was to die for. I had to use a spoon to scoop every bite up. The chicken sausage and tomatoes were delicious as well. My husband's beef was like a pot roast and tasty as well. For dessert, we split the pecan pie. I'd skip this the next time and definitely try something different. Overall, this place was delicious. Super fast and friendly service and fantastic food. We'll definitely be back!",

It first started with \"the place\" the hubs & I would come to celebrate an event....anniversary, birthday, mother's day, etc.  Now it's the place we go for a wonderful night together or to bring out of town guests or even those who've never experienced this gem!  Not once in all the years we've dined here, did we ever leave disappointed.  Mark & his staff knows how to treat people here, like they are part of his family.  They are always willing to  customize your entree by giving you a sampler of something if you can't decide between two items or change a side if you don't like what's offered.  They always aim to please!  Mark comes around personally to visit each table & has a friendly, top notch staff to support him that seems to genuinely like being there.    Being a creature of habit, I usually get the Ribbon Pasta with Chicken sausage and it's perfection, has me dreaming of my next visit!  A light, but complex broth with wide egg noodles, campari tomatoes, spinach & a fennel chicken sausage that's just amazing. The warm bacon candy salad is a party in your mouth!  Really, it's that good!!  I've also had the salmon & sea bass (a special that night), both worthy of a repeat visit!  The atmosphere has a comfortable, non-pretentious, neighborhood vibe that welcomes you whether your in jeans or a dress.  Hubs loves Marks Famous Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Grilled NY strip, I mean really, how can you go wrong!  Warm Chocolate cake, Profiteroles & Creme Brulee are just what the doctor ordered to put this one on the top of anyone's list!!",

I met the owner Mark Tarbell, which made me fall in love with this place even more. They use as much local organic produce as as they possibly can and rather than throwing away all the used vegetable oil, they re-use it for the owner's car which has been converted to run on veggie oil rather than gasoline. Fantastic for our local economy and the environment.   The service is fantastic, food is orgasmic, very lovely atmosphere, great wine list. I've ordered so many items off the menu that going into luscious details on any one and not the other would be an injustice. Every time I eat here I catch myself saying \"this is the best ______ I've ever had\".",

For the negatives, which are few, I would say it didn't feel as cozy and private as I would like to celebrate an anniversary. Although the restaurant was pretty empty, we were seated in the center of the room close to other diners. I also really appreciate it when dining in a nice restaurant for a special occasion if the restaurant asks when making a reservation and if they at least mention it. Tarbells did not do that. We had the Artichoke Leaves for a starter and I would say they were ok. Nothing special, I probably would not order those again. For the positives, the service was great. The menu was creative and everything seemed appealing on the menu. We ordered the Hand Pulled Mozzarella Salad and Himachi Crudo for starters also. Both were great, the Himachi was amazing! For entrees we ordered the Halibut and the Tars Scotch Beef. That was also amazing. For dessert we had the profiteroles. Definitely would order the Himachi Crudo, both entrees, and the profiteroles again.  We will definitely be back to try more dishes!",

Forgot to mention the fried chick peas that they give you when you sit down. I could not get enough of them. Good thing the bowl they came in was small or else I would not have enough room for everything else. Ok for our main dishes we had the homemade ribbon pasta and the bolognese. Both tastey and full of flavor. Be sure to ask for bread so you can absorb the Parmesan broth the pasta comes in. And to end our meal we had the. Lemon curd with fresh berries. It was light and delicious. It didn't make me feel guilty to have dessert when isn't heavy and so filling. All in all it was a wonderful and absolutely scrumptious night. Can't wait to come back!!",

I went around and checked out several highly recommended establishments and Tarbell's was my last stop of the day.  It was actually closed on the day that I arrived to check it out so I just looked through the windows into the restaurant and when I saw their semi-private partial glass enclosed dining room, I knew this was the place.  On the day of the event, we had two vegetarians in our party and that was not a problem at all (I think their food was actually the best).  Instead of getting an entree, my son ordered three sides and he was completely happy w/his meal.  I recall having the raspberry mojitos and chocolate martini and both were sensational.  Dessert was also top notched and to make the experience even sweeter, Mark Tarbell came by to congratulate us and thanked us for choosing his restaurant to host our special event.  From beginning to end, our meals felt like it was taking us on a culinary adventure.  Service was also excellent and everyone in the party agreed that we'd come to a very special place indeed.  I've been back to Tarbell's on a couple more occasions since then (always w/guests in tow) and the experience has always been the same...everyone leaves completely happy.  This is a very memorable place and I would come here more frequently if it wasn't so far from my house.",

The food here is always spot-on and they have some of the best comfort food selections. The spaghetti and meatballs are so good I have had day dreams about them!  Their mac and cheese is smashing as well, we usually get an order of it for the table to share. I recently got the scottish salmon and it was top-notch. For dessert, their creme brulee is amazing- wow!  It is definitely a treat to eat here!!",

    "text": "Let me just say it really takes an experience to move me to write a review for a business.  Tarbell's was so incredible on so many levels. Not only was the food incredible but the service was outstanding as well.  My husband and I had never been here and were just wanting to try it out.  We ordered wine ( which was divine) the mac and cheese and salmon dish to share, and the kale salad.  We simply asked our server questions about the mixed vegetable dish , we decided to pass since the salmon was coming out on a bed of greens.  Much to our surprise she showed up with a complimentary plate of mixed veggies to try since it was our first time there .... and no surprise at this point but the vegetables were incredible as well.  Now usually I skip dessert (spare myself the added calories) but after learning that the owner studied culinary in Paris , i was inclined to try the \"wife salted popcorn creme brulee \" .  My husband and I just got back from our first trip to Paris and I have been searching for ANYTHING that even comes close to authentic french creme brulee ..... and THIS WAS IT !!!!!  Out of this world !! Worth every calorie lol !  Not to mention when looking at the dessert menu my husband was asking how the bread pudding compared to the brulee.... and low and behold they brought some complimentary bread pudding for us .... which was also mouth watering .  We most definetley will be back and often.  This is one of our new favorites !!! If you are on the fence about trying this place out ... please do! You won't be disappointed in the least !!!!",

    "text": "Like many of the reviewers here have noted, I had pretty high expectations before we ever sat down at our table on Friday night.  I had heard of this place as a foodie-favorite and I love supporting a local celeb-worthy chef.  After a great cocktail at the bar (LOVE the atmosphere including the open kitchen -- very warm space with high energy), we sat and enjoyed the mussel app.  The size of this appetizer was disarmingly huge!  When the server brought out two large bowls, I was so confused that I asked if he had put in an order for each of us; the server kindly explained that it was just one order that he split for us (WOW).  I did not finish the app, partially because it was so huge and partially because it wasn't life-altering and I wanted to hold out for better flavors to come.  I ordered the fish special (can't remember the fish name now, but it was a sea-bass like white fish) and my date ordered the peppersteak.  We did some splitting and switching on our entrees, and honestly...they were good -- totally solid.  ....but I felt bad for having such high expectations.  Solid wasn't what I was expecting...I was expecting impressive, surprising, can't-get-enough.  Overall I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good; I wouldn't hesitate to go here for a business dinner or accept an invitation to go, but I won't be picking it in the near future.  Because I wanted to like it so much, I hope that I do go again in the future to explore the menu a bit more and perhaps better understand the hype -- the potential seems like it should be there.",

We had rock shrimp and candy bacon to start. Entrees were salmon and New York strip. They paired well with the Hive and Silver Oak cabernet respectively. We'll be back again.",

    "text": "In my business I'm fortunate that insurance company people come out every quarter to wine and dine me, and I always get to pick the restaurant! I've been hearing fabulous things about Tarbell's for years, and have been making my way to dine there for awhile. Last night was THE night!  As I walked in the door, the hostess was smiling and the owner/chef Mark Tarbell was standing right there to welcome the guests - and since I'm a huge fan of Iron Chef America, I was incredibly excited to meet him.   The waiter was soft spoken and really pleasant, and the bread they bring to your table was delicious. Upon perusing the menu, there were several things that caught my eye - the Crispy Chickpeas, the Calamari and the House-Pulled Mozzarella. I'm a huge fan of the last two (and they were really good), but the first one had me a little skeptical. The Crispy Chickpeas were DELICIOUS! Crispy, a little cheesy, and just perfect.  The Tuscan Kale also had all of us a little skeptical, since kale is generally bitter. Not so with this delightful salad, I could eat it every day! For the main course we ordered the Mr. Fish of the Moment (halibut), Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna and the Cast Iron-Seared Pepper Steak - ALL of these were absolutely perfect in temperature and flavor!   Dessert is a must, especially here! We split several desserts -  Mascarpone Cheesecake  with Rosemary Caramel Sauce (TO DIE FOR) Profiteroles with Vanilla Bean Gelato & Chocolate Sauce (AMAZING) Southern Bread Pudding with Kentucky Bourbon Sauce The \"Beloved\" Chocolate Mousse Featuring Guittard Chocolate (MY FAVORITE)  I tried and loved them all!  Bottom line - this is now at the top of my favorites list. I would eat here every day if I could afford it!",

Started the night with the Uptown, a great drink if you like Whiskey. I was impressed by how quickly after we ordered that our appetizers came out. The Caesar salad was delicious but typical of what you would expect, which is exactly what I wanted. My husband had the carpaccio which was plated amazingly and tasted delicious.  For the main course I had the pan-roasted chicken, the skin had the perfect crisp yet the chicken was so moist. I would highly recommend ordering it. My husband had the Mr. Fish which last night happened to be halibut, it was served with the best tasting hummus I have ever have. To finish the night we had both the warm chocolate cake and the apple pie. Both these desserts were wonderful. The ambiance is nice and was romantic in a booth. The staff were very attentive and really took great care of us. Tarbell's is a great Arizona restaurant that never changes which is why we love coming back there.",

    "text": "TarBlows!!!! I am not sure who is giving rave reviews of this restaurant but either they are friends with with Mark or simply do not know food?? My wife and I had reservations for 8pm and when we arrived, the manager tried to sit us at a bar high top. Are you kidding me?  With a reservation its simply standard to provide a table in the main dining area and not at the bar.  They did clear a table that had left and upon seating provided us with bread.  The bread obviously was store bought (my guess LaBrea) and had been sitting in a basket under the heat lamp.  Wife ordered his \"famous\" spaghetti and meatballs. While the meatballs were very good, the sauce was absolutely deplorable. I believe they use the pan drippings as the marinara sauce as it was extremely greasy, no taste and just simply a mess. I ordered the seafood chowder which at $25 is anything but seafood.  All they do is add a ton of butter and cream, sprinkle 4 mussels, and honestly tiny \"bits\" of seafood of salmon with corn, onion and that's about it.  Pathetic.  I have had much better at whole foods take out than that. Service was satisfactory nothing to write home about but not bad either. In conclusion, this establishment should be ashamed at the food they put out as there is simply \"no care\" about there product.    Keep to wine Mark, that's something you at least know little about!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, no longer my favorite. Seriously, they could not have gotten us out of there any faster: we sat and were handed a drink menu then within 5 seconds, approached for a drink order-wow, let me look... no martinis? So I had water :( for Valentine's Day (boo). Next,  The waitress was nice but not friendly... when she was facing us, she spoke kindly but fled before we finished speaking.... Boo. I ordered Scotch Beef Sliders without horseradish and crispy fries and you know,  they came with horseradish:(. Very difficult to get the waitress' attention because she was asking for feedback before I took my first bite (again feeling rushed) and I said the fries were good. I got her attention and told her there was horseradish on them, she grabbed the plate and was gone before I could say that I wanted them to go so that I could save room for dessert. I finally flagged down the busser who told her for me. She came to the table to let me know they are ready but I explained that I will be too full for dessert and I want dessert - she stepped away and several minutes later, brought the bag of food and apologized and scurried away. I really wanted the coconut cream pie I saw on the menu earlier so I waited and waited, watching her flit from here to there and finally caught her attention to get a dessert menu. To my dismay, no coconut cream pie. When she came back I explained that I had my heart set on coconut cream pie that I must have read on the Tavern's menu. She said ok, scooped up the menus, walked away. She completed our billing and transaction very briskly and we were on our way. They did comp the to-go sliders which was nice but that wasn't the problem-it was the experience. My husband had a great meal by himself. When the waitress did come to our table, she was unsure of the menu and unfriendly. She asked me if the horseradish was mixed in with the beef and I said, no, it's on the bun. And she spoke nicely and in a sweet voice but it seemed like she couldn't get away any faster - mid sentence. Anyway, if we go again, it will be to-go",

The food was every bit as good as we remembered (seriously, it is really good) but what set the evening apart was our server, Audrey. She was charming. She was attentive without being bothersome. She was just friggin' delightful.

For this visit I booked a reservation at Tarbell's and was excited to head there for a nice dinner. We were not disappointed! We arrived and were promptly seated. While perusing the menu we each ordered a gin martini; with a twist for me and dirty for my dad. They were both very good, but not outstanding. A group next to us ordered a variety of things on the appetizer menu and made the task of choosing one quite difficult, but we decided to go with the pommes frites. It's probably blasphemy to say that these reminded me of Steak and Shake fries, but they did, only 10x better. Somehow they are able to keep these thin fries piping hot for more than 2 minutes. We also shared the soup of the day, tomato bisque, and the bacon candy salad, both of which were delightful. For our entrees my Dad went with the Scotch beef and I picked salmon. We thought both were good, but the Scotch beef was the winner. For dessert it was again the table next to us who ordered a variety and made it difficult to pick, but we went with the bread pudding. I like bread pudding and this was good, but not great.   Overall, we enjoyed this dinner very much. It isn't very often that we go all out and indulge ourselves and Tarbell's was a good choice to do so. The service was well-timed and we never felt rushed. The waitress did a good job of checking up, but not being overly attentive. There are quite a few places to spend a nice evening in Phoenix and this is a good choice, but I wouldn't be clamoring to come back, either. I do like that Tarbell's is a nice change of pace from most of the upscale restaurants in town that specialize in steak.",

I'm not shy about paying for great food. But it was just basic food with no special twists or even unique flavor. I had a $20 gift card and I still spent over $50 and we didn't even get anything to drink. And I was still hungry when I walked out. DON'T go here for brunch. Not really sure about the other times.",

    "text": "It's unfortunate that I feel a need to update my original review from 2014 because things have changed here since then, and not for the better (in my opinion.)  It starts with me calling and making a reservation (as I do every year on my wedding anniversary.) When I arrive, they seat me in the bar area. Why? The dining room was widely available, I was dressed well and I had a reservation.  What's wrong the bar, you might ask? Foot traffic and noise. In fact, by 7pm, I had to YELL for my wife to hear me across the small table. This got old really quick.  To make matters worse, Mark has apparently changed the recipe for the mozzarella cheese on the pizza that I love so much. Now he is using Balsetta Mozzarella which is very creamy and, again in my opinion, absolutely disgusting on a pizza. Having something creamy on a nacho is fine. But having something creamy on a pizza just turns my stomach.  They used to bring four little mini French loaves to the table with butter. Now its messy, crunchy pita chips and hummus. Personally, I find hummus disgusting.   I ordered a Coke and they give you very tall narrow glasses filled with ice. This immediately reduces the volume of Coke that can fit in the glass and dilutes it to the point it loses flavor and carbonation.  When I asked for less ice, the glass was still filled with ice! In my opinion, no soda glass should be more than 1/3rd filled with ice unless a customer requests otherwise.   The service here is still impeccable. And that's what stopped me from walking out and never coming back. Our server remade the pizza with normal fresh mozzarella and put a note in the computer that when I order it in the future, I won't have to tell them. A nice touch, but weird.  The noise was outrageous. Here I am dropping near $150 for a special, romantic and delicious dinner with my wife and I can barely have a conversation with her and the food is not how I was expecting it from past experiences.  I hate to complain. I'd rather just walk out.   In the end, things were made right with the food, but it was too late. The evening was spoiled and the noise became unbearable.   What saved our business entirely was the actions of the staff. We ordered a Creme Brulee to share and they brought it to us gratis, with a beautiful 'happy anniversary' written on the plate in chocolate sauce. It was the best part of the meal!  Whether or not I'll come back for the food I can't say. But I will definitely come back for the service. I've never experienced anything quite like it before. Made me feel like I was a king. I just didn't want to complain. But at these prices and prior experiences, I felt I had to.  My wife and I really enjoy Mark Tarbell. He seems like a great guy (he has no idea who we are). We enjoy watching him on PBS Check Please and recognized his appearance in the movie Mensch as well as his YouTube videos. Perhaps one day he will offer something 'normal' on his menu for people like me that enjoy fine dining but are not food adventurous. I know what I like and it doesn't require any improvement. To have at least one common comfort food item on the menu that is SIMPLE would be very considerate for clientele like myself who consider this kind of a dining a once-a-year experience and, as such, have not developed a palette for strange blends and mixes. I bet a hamburger, chicken tenders, soft fresh pretzels with a dip, basic angel hair pasta with a simple Pomodoro sauce, would taste incredible if offered here at ANY price. Not suggesting all of it, just ONE of those items would be a delight to see offered on the otherwise mostly unrecognizable items offered on the menu.  Yes, it sucks to be a fussy eater. I hate it. I wish I could just order anything like most people, but I'm afraid of the stomach cramps and other after-effects I would experience if I forced myself to endure it.",

I love that on sundays they choose another region and bring into the menu a specific food from the region. This past Sunday I was excited for a philly cheesesteak.  Apparently many other people were also super excited and they ran out before I got my order in.  No big deal because there were 15 other things which I was excited to eat.    Needless to say it was a great night out, and this is always a top recommendation while in phoenix.",

The pan roasted chicken was delicious! Two ladies raved about the salmon! Wine selection is abundant; hence, no one had difficulty making a choice to accompany their meal! The grand finale was the decadent cheesecake topped with rosemary glaze... Split by the four of us! Our waiter, Nathan, was delightful all evening long!

And it was NOISY.   I had a hard time hearing her and vice versa.  He pondered the wine list and selected a fine bottle of chardonnay.   I have no idea what it was, but it was a good choice.   I had the squid ink angel hair with calamari, and she had the Seasonal Chowda, which is advertised to be chock full of fish Tikka Masala, saffron, jasmine rice.     I do not like the flavoring of turmeric; therefore, was glad I did not order it.   I did taste her order, however, and I suppose, if I like turmeric, I'd like it.     My dish, however, was good, albeit the pasta was cooked more than I would have liked.  It was stuck together, and I had to separate it with another utensil, but the flavoring was exquisite.   I liked the calamari.    I was stuffed, but we decided to share a dessert; therefore, we ordered the Profiteroles with Vanilla Gelato and Warm Ganache. YUMMM!!!   When served, it appeared in the shape of two cream puffs with a light covering of chocolate.   The gelato definitely cut any too sweetness there could have been.   It was good.  Well worth it.    This restaurant has been in the valley FOREVER!!   They are regulars.   Mark Tarbell, the owner, came in at the time we were waiting for our table.   A very cordial, friendly man.   Made a point of saying HI to his customers.   Would I return?   Yes, of course.   I liked what I had.    Size:  4 KB",

We arrived on time for our reservation and waited 25 minutes to be seated. Then experienced exceptionally slow service taking nearly four hours to complete the meal and were served the signature bread pudding for dessert ,cold , dry and inedible. A very disappointing performance. Pretty sure we'll be looking for a different birthday tradition - we were definitely treated as yesterday's news not longtime loyal patrons",

From the host, to the bartenders, to the wait staff...everyone here is friendly, knowledgeable and makes you feel like you are in for a special treat.  Extra bonus goes to the fact that they are attached to a wine shop, so you get some really fun wines at a really decent cost.  Talk to the sommelier, and they will lead you in the right direction.  And then to the star of the restaurant, the FOOD!!!!  Holy mother, it is simply out of this world.  I have tried a few items on the menu (scallops, shrimp, meatloaf...) but there is 1 dish in particular that keeps us coming back.  That dish, is the House-Made Ribbon Pasta.  It's almost hard to think about this dish when I'm not there, because it makes me salivate and crave it through my core, however if I have to describe it, all I can say is it's fresh pasta done perfectly, with a sauce so buttery and warm that it'll make your toes curl in excitement.  Plus, the homemade chicken sausage meatball is unlike anything I've ever eaten anywhere, and I would gladly buy a dozen of them to have on hand at home.  This dish is seriously that good.  If you are looking for a special meal that will leave you satiated and smiling, I highly recommend spending an evening at Tarbell's.  Trust me....you're gonna love it :)",

Our server Allen was almost too nice, but it seemed genuine and I hope we have him again in future visits.   We had calamari and their mozzarella special as appetizers, both had great flavor and I especially enjoyed the lighter batter they used for the calamari. Not one bit of chewiness in the calamari.   For entrees we had the lobster gnocchi and the Scotch beef. Portion for lobster gnocchi was reasonable, would leave me a little hungry if I had not gotten an appetizer. Great texture from the gnocchi and the lobster was well done. Wife enjoyed the scotch beef, picture an elevated pot roast.   Dessert was the cheesecake with their (rosemary?) caramel sauce. I did not really care for the sauce, although wife loved it and I'm sure many others do too. Again portion here was great and the texture was amazing. I hate ordering dessert (usually a rip off in my opinion) at restaurant but will certainly get this again.",

It also stated that dishes can be made vegetarian or vegan on request. I asked, and the server told me the vegetarian dish of the day was a lentil plate with peas and corn. He used more adjectives than that.  Tarbell's is the kind of restaurant that grills corn and then shaves it onto the plate. The lentil dish was excellent - it felt balanced and healthy.  The mushroom risotto had a strange aftertaste, probably due to the wine used to make it. That didn't stop me from eating every bite. The house-made burrata was out of this world. It made me wonder why I'm not sitting around making burrata and growing tomatoes at home all day. That would be paradise.   I was in and out of there in under an hour. Tarbell's kitchen was quick, and the service was attentive, but that didn't mean they pushed me out. I really appreciated that - there was a great pace that other restaurants lack.   The company was great too - I laughed so hard at one point that I caught hiccups.   The first time I actually left my Bose earbuds on the table because I tend to form small rock piles of personal belongings on white tablecloths. Fortunately, when I called the next day, they had already scooped them and were ready for pickup.   I'm looking forward to the next time I come back, and hopefully it's not because I left personal belongings.",

Our server was very attentive and answered any questions. We started out with the Tuna tartar and the warm bacon candy salad.  The chef split the appetizers which was very elegant to have your own special plate of amazing food.  I fell in love with the Candy bacon.  Wow, perfectly rendered bacon with sugar... it inspired me to make my own.    The tuna tartar's presentation was packed with flavor, freshness and eye appealing.  For dinner,  I ordered the New York steak aged 35 days and packed with pepper and seasoned to perfection. I had this steak years ago here and have never forgotten it.  I love the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach that is served with it.  This was a fantastic dinner.  We had wine with dinner that paired perfectly.  The evening was wonderful.  The dessert that our waiter brought out with Happy birthday written on it was Mascarpone Cheesecake with Rosemary sauce.  EXCELLENT!!!!  It's by far one of the best cheesecakes in my book.  The sauce is extraordinary!!  Carmel and Rosemary.... it works so wonderful together.  Thank you Tarbell's and staff for a great Birthday dinner.",

I love an open kitchen where patrons can play audience to rising cooking flames and hot dishes ready to be served.  Cubed ahi tuna and chick peas to start (sounded interesting.) And for my main, the vegetarian dish \"made with love\" as the menu stated - was indeed.    Not to be forgotten, a beautifully assorted dessert platter on the house as a birthday present and dinner topper boasting a rich array of decadent sweets including my favorite the mascarpone cheesecake with warm rosemary caramel sauce.  Mark Tarbell, I'm hooked and I'll be back for more next time I'm visiting Phoenix's camelback area.",

    "text": "JKL chapter 2 So at the risk of sounding like a Victrola I am becoming more and more disappointed with Valley bourgeois eateries. There is invariable something that becomes slightly bittersweet by the end of meal. Or beginning with Pizzeria Bianco.                                                     -side note- Sorry Chris, but your lines and wait times are outrageous. Simply because you are  the newest crush of Martha Stewart and Oprah should not allow your reputation to act like a Van Buren streetwalker. If people are first or second in line when it opens, they should have not to wait an additional hour to be seated. Phoenix is your bread and butter. If you lose us, your street cred will diminish faster than Lohan's descent into Dante's inferno.   Ok I am done.   So we arrived a few minutes past our reservations but this did not deter our hostess from seating us immediately. Very nice. And it was still busy at 8:30. Almost boisterous. We were happy. After a few minutes, servers presented us with chilled water and bread served with olive oil. The service was prompt on refills but not overbearing. Big point there. The bread was unremarkable as was the olive oil. Not very flavorful nor was the bread soft. But it was not bad.   We then order tuna tartare and and house pulled mozzarella (their name for Caprese salad). The salad would only be adequate for 2-3 people to share. However, it was delicious. Arugula, basil..well you know the rest. Very fresh, flavorful. The balsamic was amazing. The tuna was fresh but nearly flavorless. If I closed my eyes while eating it, I would have insisted that it was salty diced roma tomatoes via bruschetta. We also order a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. It was a good selection.   K ordered the pan roasted chicken. We started chuckling over this decision as chicken does not have various temperature deviations like beef or fish. So if they pulled off chicken well, that is a good sign. L ordered the bass but we were informed approximately 10 minutes later that they were out. Our spunky waitress apologized profusely.  L ordered Salmon with crispy potato cake with molasses lime syrup. I asked for the cast-iron pepper steak served medium.   K enjoyed his chicken. This is good news for Tarbells. L's fish and crispy potato cake were overwhelmed with the molasses and made the dish seem like more like dessert. Our waitress got L a new dish (3rd times the charm, right?). The manager came over and apologized. But she like it better than the first (or is it second) although it was a bit dry and missing flavor. My steak was 2/3 medium and 1/3 well-well done. It was quite peppercorny. Good cut, but the temp was off. And it could have used some more salt  from the chef so I would not have to salt it so. Perhaps it is my savory tongue that is too blame. It was not bad, just not great. The side potatoes of this dish were divine.  They comped our dessert, which was Warm Chocolate Cake with Pistachio Ice Cream. The ice cream was still solid when we got it instead of melting into some sweet fugue. The ice cream was tasty with hints of a liquor. L told me she thought our dessert was comparable to Safeway. Although it was comped, it still failed to wow us.  The food was almost completely unremarkable. The service was great. I would take servers-in-training to show them what exceptional service is. But not chefs. Bittersweet....",

For dessert, we split a piece of warm chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.  When the dessert arrived, \"Happy Anniversay\" had been written across the rim of the plate, in chocolate. It was such a nice touch. Overall it was a fantastic dinner at a reasonable price. We will definitely go back to Tarbells.",

The Hamachi crudo starter was creative and tasty, but my Scottish salmon main was dry and had more greens, and less potato crisp on the plate, than it should have. My wife's NY Steak was cooked well, but had no real flavor profile at all. I could have cooked it as well at home, easily. Some slightly over cooked greens and decent fries accompanied the steak. For $38 bucks I think, I expected way more. One other diner had the Halibut Special and reported it was kinda dry and basically uninteresting. Had the Profiterole's for dessert and they were nice. Excellent wine list BTW, but VERY pricey. This is not a place I would rush back to. Sorry........",

They had other very good cuts of beef, as well a fresh seafood.  For dessert, the four of us split an order of profiteroles and an order of their chocolate mousse.  Yummy.  The atmosphere was fairly quiet.

They seated us immediately (we had reservations) and our server was very attentive. They immediately brought out bread (delish) and water. Not long after, our wine arrived. Speaking of wine, don't be scared when you see the wine list...I didn't see any wines by the glass, only bottles, so I simply told the server what I wanted, and there it was!   I had the tagliatelle (sp?) pasta with wild mushrooms. SO good. I'm a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess, and this hit the spot. Why can't I do this at home?? Oh, and the soup... divine! The special was potato and leek soup. Perfectly smooth, must have been strained several times to get it this smooth. Very comforting. Hubby had the mac & cheese for an ap...YUM! That Vermont cheddar is just too good! He had the pork chop for his entree, and I will never be able to make pork chops at home again. Oh well! He thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert we had the Iron Chef apples, which were perfect. We were pretty full by this point, but these three adorable little tasty apples were just the right finishing touch.  The second best part of our night (the food was first, of course) was meeting Mark Tarbell! I tried not to act like a fool, but I watched him on Iron Chef, so it was cool to meet him! He was very friendly, very down to earth, and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience. He was walking around to all the tables...great chef!   So for a nice night out, you can't beat this place. Enjoy!",

The crispy sweet potatoes on the field greens were a nice variation on croutons. I had the Mr. Fish special - seared halibut over Parmesan polenta. Ric had the Scotch Beef. Both were excellent. And we finished with the Date Cake with butterscotch sauce - obscenely delicious.

Whatever bleu cheese they used on the bibb salad was one of the better bleus I've had.  Creamy, sweet, with the perfect amount of bite.  The candied bacon took the first round to another level. Wow.  All around, the appetizers had us panting for more.  Which made the main course all the more disappointing.  The scotch beef was dry and just a little bit better than my mom's pot roast.  The ribbon pasta was ok, but didn't have that special pop.  And the bolognese was just boring.  The disappointment with the mains and the fact that we weren't seated until 8:25 (we had an 8pm reservation) docked a star from the overall review.  Much was at stake with dessert.  Fortunately, dessert was delicious.  The mousse, cheesecake, and the profiteroles were all perfect.  Rich, full of flavor, perfectly sweetened.  The four stars were secured.  I will say that the two groups on either side of our table were a bit too rambunctious for me.  Listening to older masters of the universe talk about the size of their penises (literally) and having their very drunk female companions talk about sex all night was at first a little amusing, but after an hour, it got to be a little old.  Hopefully our next visit will be a little more subdued.",

    "text": "*My 200th Review* Tarbell's, you were a dream come True!  This is what 5 stars is to me- The very best service. Every staff member was professional, personable, well groomed, prompt, and smiled often!  The restaurant itself was simple and elegant. Definitely a place I would recommend for a date or special occasion or anytime you want to be fancy!   The crowd was mostly retirees, but I took that as a sign that I was in the right place.  The other diners were very dapper and able bodied and seemed to clearly enjoy the finer things in life.   The food. Mmmmmm yes!! I had the scallops, and they were the best I've ever had. It came with a potato cake and seasonal vegetables, each bite equally delicious. The salmon was also excellent and grilled to perfection. Even the grill marks were absolutely perfect, which I admire because I can not do that myself! It was accompanied by mixed greens with an amazing honey glaze dressing, and potatoes another way- similar to shoe string pik nik sticks but much fancier and salty and mouth watering. We shared the caramel cheesecake for dessert, and that was probably the low point of the meal. Kidding!! Omg, I rarely eat dessert and this was worth.every.calorie!! Perfection! Not to sweet, not too dense, not too light, so full of flavor! The caramel sauce! My, my! I really can't wait to go back. I am very curious about the spaghetti and meatballs! And the profiteroles! I want to try the whole menu, each time it changes!  Thank you Tarbell's, for making my 30th birthday dinner amazing!  Edit: I received a warm phone call from Ty 2 days after dining to inquire how my experience was. I can't say that has ever happened before even at other fine establishments. Very classy. Thanks Ty!",

    "text": "WOW, Tarbell's is unforgettable and will definitely be a GO-TO for special occasion dinners. (and maybe even to treat myself at the bar :) ...)  Walked in on a Thursday night around 8 pm and were seated at a nice 4-top table right in the center of the dining area, I'm difficult to please, and just by where they placed us, good vibes had already been given off. Our server, Nathan, knew just when to stop by, was able to answer all our questions, and was not pushy at all. The dinner was perfectly timed out, and he never made me feel rushed to finish a course. ....Seriously, what an experience, while we weren't celebrating anything special, Tarbell's truly provided us with a remarkable experience.  After ordering wine, Nathan offered to pick our starters for us since we were unfamiliar with the menu. He selected the Warm \"Bacon Candy\" Salad, and the Farmers Market Plate. Just a few bites in, my expectations for the rest of the meal were very high.   After our plates were cleared, our entrees arrived. The seafood risotto was good, but a little too overwhelmed with the taste of salmon; but the Tar's Scotch Beef, and the house made Ribbon Pasta with Chicken Fennel Sausage were phenomenal; you can taste quality in every bite... yum!  And lastly, of course I always save room for dessert, I was stuck between the Vanilla Cheesecake with Rosemary Carmel, and the Warm Chocolate Cake, BOTH WERE WONDERFUL!   A genuine thank you to Tarbell's, and Nathan, for making this dinner such a fantastic experience. Dining is one of my favorite ways to explore the city, and I'm so glad to have made a last minute decision to enjoy my Thursday night at your restaurant. 5 stars.. without question!",

It was great to see his demeanor with guests like us and his happy face.  We ordered the Carpaccio which was amazing as always with the arugula, just enough vinaigrette and that lovely cheese.  For our main course, my man ordered the Lobster Gnocchi, and the Fettucini with Morrell Mushrooms ( Our server Nathan graciously offered to serve half and half)  I ordered the Peppered New York Strip with Au Gratin Potatoes and creamed spinach. I requested Med Rare and MORE on the rare side than medium.  My husbands was delivered and was delicious. My first bite of steak was disappointing as it was overcooked and not so flavorful ( we noted also our plates had sat under the lights awhile before being served) . I poked around and Benjamin the busboy notice. He came over and discreetly asked if something was wrong. I described my overdone steak. Action was taken immediately and a new steak delivered. It was good but not melt in your mouth.....our server after this became surly with us. I really applaud Tarbell's as they did not charge for my meal. We tipped our server on the ENTIRE amount anyway.  It was a good dinner but not what we usually are used to at our wonderful Tarbell restaurant.  We will go back but we expect it to be a lot more top of the line!",

Do not go on a weekend because it is impossible to park there. Although they supposedly have valet parking, they were no where to be found and the cars were backed up onto a very busy street. People were getting out of their cars to scream at others who were blocking cars while waiting for valet who never arrived. The worst I've ever witnessed. By the time we found a space to park, which we created ourselves, we were very upset before entering the restaurant. Tarbell's is located in a tiny strip center with other restaurants and woefully inadequate parking. Don't think it's worth the hassle.",

We arrived a little early for our 5:45 p.m. reservation.  While waiting, the owner came over and introduced himself to us and said our table would be available shortly, and it was.  The staff was well trained and very friendly.  My wife had the halibut and I had the Scottish beef.  Both were cooked to perfection, the presentations were very creative and the seasonings were amazing.  Absolutely delicious!  We had calamari for an appetizer.  It was served promptly and was excellent.  The Beloved Chocolate Mousse was the perfect ending to a perfect meal....outstanding! We don't live close to the restaurant, but will definitely eat here again.  Thanks to Mark and his staff for a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "We had never been to Tarbell's before, and decided it was the place to grab an early Mother's Day dinner. The service is impeccable, and you will feel tended to throughout your visit.  I enjoyed my grilled romaine salad, and the roasted chicken was wonderful. I'd read on Yelp that they would let you order half portions, which allowed me to get half a salad, as well as half of the chicken paired with half of the ribbon pasta. Yes, that was far too much food for me, but I was able to try a variety of things, and had leftovers for tomorrow. I appreciate that Tarbell's offers this option for portions. I shared the cheesecake for dessert, and it was wonderful. If the description of rosemary in the caramel sauce freaks you out, don't worry. It really is just a hint of the herb.  **I almost dropped a star off my review because of the owner, but decided that the food and service are what matters. He was making his way to all of the tables, yet pointedly skipped ours. The logical assumption is that he was very busy. But when he first came through, we were one of three occupied tables. As the room filled, he made it to every table  but ours. As we stood up to walk out, he made eye contact with me. No smile, no \"thanks for coming\"- he just  turned away. It was hard not to feel completely slighted.",

The portions were just the right size. We all cleaned our plates and weren't stuffed, but not hungry either. We had the butternut squash soup, which was the only disappointment. We all agreed that it was a little bland We ordered a white wine and because the bottle wasn't chilled enough we received another wine (on the house) until our wine was ready to drink. The wait staff was very attentive, but not hovering. A wonderful experience. We'd all go back.",

This story is about my love of scallops and cheesecake ... and rosemary. If you want to impress me, feed me these things. Seriously, that's all you have to do. Basically, anything with rosemary will make me like you.    Unfortunately (and fortunately), I was on a date during this dining experience. When the cheesecake arrived, I wanted to devour the whole thing, but I had to pretend to be a lady. Apparently, ladies don't shovel dessert into their mouth like a hungry animal ... at least, according to that etiquette school I attended as a child.  I can only eat desserts on dates, otherwise I have no self-control. Oh, little ol' me? Just a bite. Yeah, that's all I want. Just a taste. No, no, I couldn't possibly. Okay, maybe one more. Okay, this is the last bite. What's that? You're looking away for a second? Boom, okay, one more bite won't hurt. Just don't go to the bathroom, okay? I can't be trusted.",

Tarbells was the only place I could find that served creme brulee, so that's how we ended up here. The staff was very nice and attentive even though we were only having dessert.   I got the cheesecake with caramel sauce and my husband got the creme brulee served with fresh berries. Both of the desserts were amazingly delicious! The cheesecake was one of the best I have ever had, my husband who just wanted creme brulee was addicted to the cheesecake by the end. It was a very generous portion served in a fun cylinder shape, and it was so rich and smooth I couldn't quite finish all of it which makes me a little sad. The creme brulee was also really good, crispy on top and creamy underneath, lots of delicious berries as well.",

Now, I must say, the service was 5 stars (great server and charming Mr. Tarbell came by and chatted with us) However, the quality of what was on our table just simply wasn't there.    Two people in our party of three ordered off the restaurant week menu.  The fresh mozzarella appetizer was described as \"delicious, but lacking pesto\".  I ordered the Grilled Organic Salmon on Crispy Potato Cake molasses, lime, McClendon's honey.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and I thoroughly enjoyed the tangy glaze.  But OMG!!-- the crispy potato cake confused the hell out of me-- it tasted like burnt shoestring potato pieces.  Seriously. I expected crisp fritter or hash...something edible and not over-deep-fried.  Onto dessert.....I opted out, but the other 2 were given dessert with the restaurant week deal.  The mousse was terrific! (props to that) The doughnut holes were a letdown.  Like my potatoes, they where very overcooked.  In fact, one was ridiculously dark brown-- visibly over-fried.  We were kind of surprised it was even brought to our table like that.  For the price that we paid for average food, I really wished we would have gone across the street to Noca :(  Highlights:  service, atmosphere, mozzarella, mousse",

A few minutes later he brought over a plate of sliders made with the beef so we could sample it. It was delicious!  I ordered that as my entree and was very in love with it. My husband had the Scottish Salmon and asked to pair it with asparagus risotto and the were happy to accommodate. After our food was gone they brought us an amazing serving of cheesecake with rosemary Carmel sauce because he heard us mention it was our anniversary. The buttermilk mashed potatoes are to die for.

The service was top notch, it did get a bit noises (but the noise was fun energetic chatter...which was nice). Visually the food was average...but probably better than most restaurants.

We were promptly seated then water and bread with EVOO were served moments after we arrived. Our server was very informative, extremely pleasant and non-intrusive. Chef Tarbell came by our table and chatted for a few minutes then each course came out as the previous plate was lifted.   The food is always fresh and delicious. My wife had the beet salad and I started with the potato and celery soup.  We both chose the fish of the day which was red snapper flown in from Maine. The bean medley that accompanied the fish was just as good as the entree itself.  Chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream polished of a wonderful Valentine's dining experience.  Bravo Chef Tarbell  PS We love this place so much because it is a place for foodies that is not pretentious. It is a business casual affair and the decor and layout are very appealing.  The windows always catch our attention because they remain impecibally clean.  You'll SEE what I mean.",

One of my all-time favorites there are the spaghetti and meatballs. One of their signature dishes and probably some of the best I've had in town!  Our service last night was outstanding....as usual! The place is indeed small. Reservations on the weekend are necessary well in advance. So its easy to imagine that they try to turn tables quickly. No excuse, however, for a customer feeling rushed.

He always puts a unique touch on basic dishes, again making you feel special.  Love love love this place and it's a MUST for anyone dining in Phoenix.  The wait staff was extremely attentive never even allowing our glasses of water to get half empty.  We were never rushed to leave even long after out meal was paid for.  Always an enjoyable experience.  Thanks Mark!!",

    "text": "What a restaurant! Absolutely loved my experience at Tarbells. I've been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently. My party and I sat at the bar, which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable, rather large and really social and fun. The bartender (young woman) was fabulous, inviting and very nice! She was very attentive. A guest in my party dines at Tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the bar.....Now thats some customer service for ya!  Food = We started with the Calamari. A favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding. Two very different but delicious dipping sauces. A roasted red pepper and a pesto mix. Not sure which one I liked more :) I enjoyed the pan-seared jumbo sea scallops. TO DIE FOR. I am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right. Caramelized, giving them the right amount a sweet....and it was served over very yummy risotto. Another dish enjoyed by my party was the Fennel Sausage Pasta dish, the fennel sausage was AMAZING.   Overall experience was fantastic, as soon as I get another opportunity I will be dining here again! :)",

The ambience in the restaurant was nice and subdued.  The menu was filled with a good mix of fresh veggies and great meat dishes. We all had a hard time choosing what we wanted. The chef was no help; he sent a appetizer of calamari for us to share. It was delicious. My son ordered the salmon and his girlfriend had the pan seared chicken. Both thoroughly enjoyed their entrees. My boyfriend chose small plate of the Carpaccio and I had the Scotch beef. The gravy was so smooth and the mashed potatoes so tasty, I wanted to lick the bowl. Everyone really enjoyed the evening.",

I was on a date but I could have just have easily had a dinner with anyone here and it would have been perfect. The menu is not elaborate but very creative. My friend ordered the pasta and they offered to split two dishes for him so he could sample both. Great wine list. Not the best I've seen but you can definitely find a nice bottle.  Mark up is going to be ridiculous of course so find one you like and then get it at AJs or Total Wine.  The service was prompt and friendly. The table next to us was doing Grande Marnier flight which was different.  Dessert which we never skip was delicious! We had the mousse. I had the Scotch beef.  It was so tender and flavorful,  it just pulled apart on my fork. We also tried the pizza as an appetizer.  So good!  It was dim and quiet.  Some music played and there were plenty of servers.  Overall very nice place. Prices are a tad high comparatively.  Filet was about $49. But if it's a special occasion or, you're not paying,  definitely recommend! !",

    "text": "From greeting to goodbye, this was a superb dining experience.  I was able to make a reservation using Open Table.  A friendly Tarbell's caller confirmed the reservation on the day we were scheduled.  I told them we were celebrating a wedding anniversary, though we did not want a fuss and we rarely eat dessert, so I wasn't asking for anything.  We were greeted with a sincere \"Happy Anniversary\".  Our server was relaxed and well informed.  I told her that I avoid gluten, and she immediately knew how to advise me with the menu.  We started with wine by the glass.  I had a light pinot Grigio and my husband had the Malbec.  Both were just fine.  We then ordered, sharing a Caesar salad for a starter.  It was romaine and kale, an interesting variation of the traditional Caesar.  We didn't have to ask for no croutons.  I ordered the mussels and my husband ordered a steak and buttermilk mashed potatoes.  After we finished the plated shared salad, our server surprised us with two magnificent appetizers.  She took it upon herself to choose appetizers for us because I told the confirmer that we don't eat many desserts.  The mozzarella and tomato salad and the sweet bacon with cabbage were outstanding!  Our main dishes were perfectly prepared.  Servings were huge.  The potatoes were exceptionally good.  I finished with an illy espresso, as good as I have ever had.  This was one of the best, most unique dining experiences we have had.  I can't wait to return.",

    "text": "So I just came back from Tarbell's.  Underwhelmed and slightly offended would be the summary for my experience there.  The positives, straight-away:  the ambiance, decor and the bartender serving me were all perfectly adequate -- and that's where they end.  So I'll be the first to admit, I'm a male 30-something showing up alone on the Saturday before Mother's day, without a reservation and wearing a tshirt and jeans (nice ones though).  Even if you consider gender and age profiling aside, there is absolutely no excuse for how I was treated when I walked through the door.  I walk in, and the hostess just gives me a blank stare.  I say \"Hi\".  She continues to just stare at me like I'm a two headed alien.  I actually had to initiate spoken language by glibly asking \"This is a restaurant, right?\" -- clearly I'm trying to get noticed -- there isn't a crowd around me.  \"Yes this is a restaurant ...\" followed by more staring and silence.  I say \"well, I'm pretty hungry, can we do something about that\" -- and only then does she bother to explain that the dining room is full but I could find myself a seat at the bar.  Gee thanks.  It was so unbelievably disrespectful and unwelcoming I'm pretty sure the only reason I actually sat down at the bar was because there was a seat open, and I was still trying to process what had just happened.  Trying to put that behind me, the lady barkeep takes my drink order, and my food order:  carpaccio ($17) and the NY steak ($44).  The carpaccio was the most boring carpaccio I have ever had -- not bad, not good: boring.  Insanely, there was too much meat!  Just all meat and parmigiano -- a little more olive oil and some simple dressed greens would have made that dish so much better.  The steak I ordered medium-rare.  It came out medium, it was kinda charred, and really tough for \"35 day aged\" hand-picked angus prime -- more like the consistency of medium London broil from Safeway.  It had a sauce on it (which wasn't mentioned on the menu) that just looked and tasted like the most basic demi-glace sauce you could imagine -- at first I thought it was the steak bleeding off.  I don't eat potatoes, so I just asked for extra spinach.  Pan creamed?  Pfft -- I swear it was simply a pile of salted, wilted spinach -- it had no seasoning I could detect, much less any kind of cream or butter or anything.  It was so plain it was sticking to my teeth.  I skipped dessert.  Final thoughts:  after some consideration, I still gave this place 2 stars.  If you're an older, much more boring person in the world, this place is right up your alley.  With all the Bentleys and Porsches parked out front (I saw some fogey driving a Viper!) this place would probably be perfect for older rich people that have no real palate:  people that go to restaurants to improve their socioeconomic standing among their peers instead of discovering mind-blowing food.  I'm sure Chef Tarbell is an excellent chef, but I'm under the impression he has had to dumb down his food because the well-heeled, stodgy clientele wouldn't be able to appreciate the real thing.  That, or Food Network's ICA is scripted and staged.",

    "text": "As a foodie, traveling through Phoenix, I was excited to be able to dine at Tarbells. Sadly, my experience did not live up to the billing. As a solo diner, it was obvious I was pegged as a \"turn and burn\". I was quickly served  a tasty olive oil and bread for dipping, however the bread tasted very much like frozen par  baked bread, that had been reheated. I would have expected something a little more refined in such a restaurant. The server, who when I asked about the menu, what she liked, did not tell me about the specials I heard her recite at other tables around me. I ordered the carpaccio which came out in less than 3 minutes. Obviously plated ahead and kept in the fridge with which I have no problem per se, but the chilled meat subtle taste was masked by the very cold what was beautifully marbled beef. Add to that, the overpowering amount of vinaigrette dressing on what looked like pretty arugula and the carpaccio was almost indiscernible.  On the server's recommendation I ordered housemade ribbon noodles with homemade chicken fennel sausage, tomato, spinach in a rich buttery broth for my entree. What arrived was a very full bowl of broth that was very very rich with butter and for the first three spoonfuls was luxurious, but way too rich to be able to enjoy it in the quantity served. The fresh noodles that I had to search through the broth were stuck together in one mass under a small pile of canned tomatoes, the accompanying spinach also lost somewhere in the broth. The sausage looked like a breakfast pattie that had been browned on one side and then broken into pieces. Not what I was expecting. The fennel seed was so overpowering I could not eat it all. Because of the reputation and rave on line reviews I will tell myself, maybe I made lesser menu selections and will, when I am in Phoenix later in the year go back and try again. Fingers crossed.",

Regrettablly, I have to eat there a few times a year as my boyfriend's father likes this place because of their round table in a semi-private room.   Last night was hopefully the last time I will eat there until the Holiday season.  I ordered the Fire-roasted Seafood Chowder.  It was bland and lukewarm.  It tasted like someone opened a can of ro-tel tomatoes and added chuncks of overcooked Salmon.  A chef should be ashamed to serve such a dish.  If it would have been just my boyfriend and myself dining - I would have sent it back without hesitation.  Did I mention that this \"chowder\" was $18 - ridiculous.

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to Tarbell's for awhile now, since it's such a greatly reviewed local restaurant, and because head chef Mark Tarbell also won Iron Chef America, when he battled Cat Cora with the secret ingredient of apple. (His winning dessert from the show is on the menu.)  I'm disappointed I wasn't completely wowed by the place, but the friendly and knowledgeable staff was definitely appreciated.  The restaurant's decor isn't particularly stunning. The tables do have linens on them, but the atmosphere was pretty plain, save for a few brightly colored paintings. The view outside is of a parking lot, so while the restaurant looks cool from the outside with its window walls, it's not fun to look at cars on cement while you're eating.  The crowd skewed older, middle-age and above. Besides a couple kids with families, I might have been the youngest person dining there, which seemed sort of weird. It's definitely a place I'd rather go when I'm middle-aged and have savings to spend, rather than head there now.  Food-wise, I was impressed with the abundance of locally grown ingredients. That's a really great thing to have in a restaurant, so it was really respectable, but the food just wasn't spectacular like I had hoped.  The salad I started with, Maya's Field Greens ($9), had fennel, carrots and an amazing carrot vinaigrette (I left the beets off my salad.) It was really heavy on the greens (I sort of felt like a rabbit as I ate it), but because they tasted so fresh, it made up for the lack of diversity in the salad. And the dressing was so delicious, I would prefer it over ranch-and that's a big deal for me.  For my entree, I had housemade fettuccine, with a spinach pesto sauce, squash, caramelized onions and goat cheese ($19). While the sauce was great, and I really enjoyed the goat cheese flavor, I wasn't as enthused with the consistency of the pasta. The strips were so thin, it almost melted together. It was difficult to twirl on my fork and a little messy to eat. I did like the combination of so many flavors, though.  We also had crispy chickpeas ($4), which were very interesting. I prefer regular chickpeas to these crispy ones, but they were seasoned well with parmesan, olive oil and parsley and tasted even better when I added them to my pasta. I just wouldn't order them to eat them alone again.  My favorite part of the meal, besides the tasty bottle of red wine we had from the massive wine list, was the dessert. We had chocolate mousse ($9), which was thick and creamy and topped with tasty whipped cream.  The dessert wasn't enough to make me want to come back any time soon. I feel like I could get better farm-to-table food at chicer places for less money (see St. Francis). Maybe I'll try Tarbell's out again, but it probably won't be until I'm way older.",

    "text": "Ok, to be fair, I am that rarest of breeds: a vegetarian foodie.   I realize that gives me a lot more challenges at many restaurants, but I have to say I was really disappointed with the food at Tarbell's. I had read all the reviews about how he was an Iron Chef competitor, etc, so perhaps I was expecting too much.  We dined very early, so there was no issue with parking or crowding in the restaurant as many other reviewers had mentioned. We were seated immediately. Server was pleasant and informative as well as prompt. I have no issue at all with the service. In fact it was quite exceptional. It was the food which disappointed.  I asked the server about vegetarian options. There was a seasonal vegetable mixture on the menu and the server convinced me that was the way to go. We discussed a few other options, but I went with his recommendation. When it came to the table the presentation was \"interesting\" but not especially appetizing.   The flavor wasn't disgusting but certainly not great. I ate about a quarter of it. The server asked if I disliked it. I told him it was edible but not great. He instantly offered to replace it with something else. Points to him. I declined a replacement because there really wasn't anything else vegetarian-without-alteration on the menu that evening. I declined having him take the item off the bill as I did eat part of it. Without being asked the server informed me later that he had taken my entree off the bill.   I forget what we had for dessert. That's a bad thing. Dessert should be memorable.   All in all the bread was really good, the rest of the food was only ok, the service was great, ambiance was ok and the price was WAY too high for what we received, even with my $22 veggie-pile entree removed from the bill. I'm not a cheapskate and I am no stranger to a $200 dinner, but it better be a darn good experience for that. Sadly it wasn't. Dinner companion and I will not be returning.",

We arrived ahead of time and were seated immediately, which was great! Unfortunately we were seated next to a very large group of women who were extremely loud. In order to talk we had to yell at each other and even then we couldn't hear the other person. This was not what I was expecting for ambiance. We asked to be moved to a quieter area and were promptly moved. The ability to move us was a huge plus, the noise almost ruined the nice evening I had planned. The food came out and was absolutely delicious. We started with the Burrata, I had the George Bank Scallops (amazing) and my mom had the Scottish Salmon (equally delicious). We ended our meal with the pre selected desert, Vanilla Creme Bruelee with mixed berries. They spelled my moms name incorrectly...that really irritated me because I spelled it out in advance when I called the day before, but overall the experience was redeemed by the food and the really great staff. In my opinion I wouldn't go back to Tarbell's for a special occasion, unless you don't mind the noise. It gave us the feel of an upscale sports bar than a fine restaurant. However, I would dine here again with friends.",

The atmosphere is \"cool\" and allows one to feel comfortable arriving in a suite and tie or in jeans and a tee shirt.  The staff is welcoming and attentive to detail. There are seasonal dishes that are interesting, amazing and rare - and standby dishes that we love to order.  Things to try: House pulled Mozzarella with tomatoes - yes, it is a standard in many restaurants until you try this one, and this will become your new standard. The chicken fennel sausage with broth is one of the most incredibly complex broths that tastes like it was made with incredible care and precision. Pan roasted chicken is never dry, perfectly crispy skin. The vegetable plate is amazing, almost enough to inspire me to become a vegetarian. Fish of the moment - always fresh, flown in daily, prepared well - my wife loves the halibut. My son has gone there since he was born - he is welcome there, fussed over, and they always have noodles ready for him (home made). I cannot recommend this place enough",

As someone else mentioned, it isn't the most cozy place (read: romantic), but it was certainly nice.  The only reason I didn't given it 5 stars is because we have gone other places that were even nicer, with outstanding service (Tarbell's service was great, just not impeccable which is what we were looking for that night). The food was great.  We ordered the mussels and expected a bowl with a dozen in them to share- NOPE!  We EACH had a dozen mussels...almost unable to eat them all and dinner!   The place was busy, mostly an older quieter crowd which was nice, until a trio of young Scottsdale-ians walked in.  Boo. Valet was super easy, food was great.  Would go back for a nice dinner, just not for our nice Christmas Eve dinner.",

I initially chose this restaurant just for the grilled Caesar which was better than I thought it could be.  When our waiter Keith offered to give me a half portion of the lobster gnocchi and a 1/2 portion of the squid ink pasta instead of making me choose, I fell in love with the place.  Only thing better than that service was the taste of those two dishes which were INCREDIBLE!!!  Oh, the molten chocolate cake we had with salted caramel sauce topped this dinner off in a way I couldn't imagine.  Go have a great dinner at Tarbell's!",

    "text": "This past Saturday night we visited Tabell's after talking about it for years. It's probably been 20+ years since we've been there. We arrived early and were seated quickly. The place was filling in fast. It was somewhat quiet with the carpeted flooring and diamond shaped foam sound suppressers on the ceiling. Our waiter was Nathan, very nice and professional. Our order started with some apps. I ordered the Escargot and my wife was considering the mussels but changed her mind. Nathan asked if she would like a half order and she said no. A few moments later my escargot arrives and a small plate of 4 mussels. Nathan said he didn't want her to feel left out. The escargot was prepared differently than most times I had them. They were cooked well and laid in a small dish of mushroom sauce. The mussels he gave my wife were horrible. Mussels should be somewhat firm in the shape of your thumb and orange in color. These had the texture/taste of warm slimy oysters. My wife had to spit hers out into her napkin. I tried one and it was pretty bad. I've never had slimy mussels before. Our entree's arrive, I had the salmon and my wife had the special for the night, the halibut. My salmon laid on a bed of salad and then on a second bed of grated potatoes that were glazed together into a hard layer and served cold. I'm not sure if they were just for aesthetics or too eat. I broke a few pieces off and it was ok.... My wife's halibut was full of grease and was like eating mush greasy pudding. There was no flakiness, texture or taste. It was the worst halibut we've ever had. I tried some and I had to pass also. We only ate half our plates and a woman came by and picked up our plates, so the waiter never saw the amount we ate. We didn't want to complain and start a ruckus. We passed on desert and left for home. We were so disappointed and let down, I don't think we said three words on the way home to Gilbert. Very disappointing evening...",

    "text": "Tonight was my first time eating at Tarbell's and if you don't want to read my entire review below, then just know that I HIGHLY recommend eating here (especially with a significant other on date night).  Over the years my girlfriend has only heard incredible things about this place but since she lives in Peoria, she's never got around to trying it. Since I live pretty close and decided to have a nice dinner tonight, she managed to schedule a same-day reservation for 8pm and on a Friday no less!  We arrived shortly after 8, and walked into what seemed like a packed house. Even as we were taken to our table, I was only able to spot a handful of open seats (and that's including both bar seats and open tables!). One of the only things that I did not enjoy was how it seemed just slightly too overpacked. I would have rather paid an extra $10 on my bill to have more breathing/walking room.   Our waitresses name was Jaclyn, and she is one of the main reasons why we will be coming back regularly! I imagine that all of the wait staff are as attentive and accessible as Jaclyn was. Why else would it stay so packed until closing :)? (Thank you again Jaclyn!)  As for the food, we were given complimentary pita chips and hummus (YUM!). I was in the mood for a pasta dish so I asked for Jaclyn's recommendation. She insisted on the spaghetti and meatballs and her 2nd choice was the bolognese. Me being childish, I chose the bolognese because it sounds like bologna and she said the noodles are ribbon noodles. My stunning date ordered the mussels and the beet salad.   \"The beet salad was not worth it at all. The ratio of beets to arugula was like 10:1, the plating was lackluster, AND the portion size left a lot to be desired....shame\" -K Rose  Shortly after my bolognese was brought to table (very quickly I might add), I though it tasted pretty good. Then Jaclyn, without any request from us, brought a decent sized sample of what I missed out on from the meatballs. OH MY GOODNESS, IT WAS EASILY THE BEST MEATBALL I HAVE EVER HAD...(secretly I was a little sour about it because I was stuck with bolognese and was wishing I had ordered the meatballs)  All in all, this was a fine 5 star dining experience. The wait staff was great, the environment was electric, and the food was top notch. I highly recommend you try this place, and please don't make my mistakes... get the meatballs!",

We had dinner reservations at Tarbell's and decided to just eat small and save room for some downtown Phoenix bar hopping.  However, Tarbell's made that difficult because everything on the menu looked completely jaw dropping incredible. We ordered the 'Mr.Fish of the moment' *drool* we were also able to try the calamari which was fresh and not overly seasoned so the flavor bursted with the salsa verde.  For dessert I HAD to try the cheesecake with rosemary caramel. The hint of rosemary balanced out the sweet caramel and the delicious heaviness of the BEST cheesecake my tastebuds have ever been gifted of trying. I will dream of that cheesecake for years.  Thank you so kindly to Eric for making my birthday dinner special and overal, memorable!",

They always talk about the excellent treatment that they receive from the manager, the servers, and the bartender. We were in the Phoenix area for my fiance's birthday and he decided to spend his birthday night dining at Tarbell's. We had made a reservation prior to coming. When we got there, we were a little bit early for a reservation so we decided to enjoy some cocktails and appetizers at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender was incredible at explaining all the different kinds of bourbons that they had and the distilleries they came from to my fiance and his dad because they love bourbon. I also enjoyed a delicious vodka martini. They brought a few different appetizers and even brought out a complimentary dish for us! I ordered the salmon when we finally got to our table, and of course my fiance and his parents got the steak. The steak is really what the restaurant is known for. They had a great menu as well. My salmon was delicious. My fiance enjoyed his steak but later on felt sick because there was a lot of black peppercorn on the steak that didn't really sit well with him. I have noticed that a lot of fine dining - steak restaurants, they often season their steaks a bit too much for our taste. Our server-Alan was spectacular! They brought out a complimentary birthday dessert for my fiance which was nice. The prices are high, but it is a fancier - upscale restaurant where people dress up and enjoy the fine dining. There is a parking lot outside that is pretty spacious. Overall, I would recommend going here for the food and the environment.",

My husband and I had the rare occasion to have a babysitter. Perhaps my expectations were too high...   I'll just jump right to the end of the story and tell you,... my lobster gnocchi was shockingly over-salted. My preference typically veers towards overly-salted anyway! How could this be? It could have met my high expectations if not for this. Fluffy little gnocchi, light and balanced sauce, fresh hunks of lobster ocean goodness. We also tried the popular desserts - cheesecake and profiteroles. I love cheesecake but this version got rid of the parts I like best - the graham cracker crust was just a sliver of mostly soft crumbs, and the texture of the rest was less soft melty goodness but rather edging towards flan.  On the good end of the spectrum, my husband's ribbon pasta with chicken fennel sausage was also slightly salty but with outstanding flavor. I get why it has such high reviews. I'd go back just for that. Our Nashville-night-special fried pickles were, as I was hoping they would be, the perfect upscale version of one of my guilty food pleasures.   I left with the hope to go back someday but it may be half a lifetime before I decide to work it back in for another try.   *sigh*",

    "text": "I've had Tarbell's bookmarked for as long as I can remember-- I'd heard and read about local chef celebrity Mark Tarbell's 2007 Iron Chef America victory over Chef Cat Cora, so it's been a wait of ten years!  A friend and I just finished a lovely bottle of white with charcuterie from a wine bar nearby and wanted dessert, so we both checked our Yelp apps for bookmarks and Tarbell's came up.  Turns out he's never been to Tarbell's either, has never even heard of the restaurant, and all it took were photos of a cheesecake and profiteroles and the decision was made-- my wait was over!  I had no idea that it's so lovely indoors!  We walked through the entrance to find a crescent-shaped bar in the middle of the restaurant, with an open kitchen behind it and a few tables lining the walls to the left and right of the bar.  There were colorful abstracts under subdued lighting on the walls, and I appreciated that it wasn't very dark inside.  (I'm not a fan of dark interiors kept dark to induce low inhibitions.  Part of the magic of dining out for me is the plating of the food, as well as the use of colors and textures to create beautiful ambience.)  Tarbell's is intimate and has a lively energy, as well.  And there's no doubt that the bar is center stage and the place to be, at least for dessert and cocktails!  I hadn't planned on having any more to drink besides water, since we already had cocktails elsewhere, but a man sitting to our left offered to buy us a round, but with his choices of alcohol.  (He'd heard me nix the whiskey sauce on one of the desserts we'd chosen, so he instructed bartender Mikey not to give me anything corn-based.)  Turns out he's a liquor supplier of Tarbell's, or something- hey, I was buzzed and busy taking a photos of the orange hippo sitting on top of the coffee machine and our gorgeous desserts! <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=A9-EzvvbpUonfivsDlyEng&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I didn't enjoy the gin-based mojito drink I was given, but I thank you for your generosity, anyway!  Friend enjoyed his twist on an Old-fashioned and Sazerac.  But what about dessert?  We couldn't decide on profiteroles or bread pudding, so bartender Mikey said he could give us half of each; an order of profiteroles includes two pieces, so we were given one. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=h2lEoTL6fB4NZZWBWuavtg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  The profiterole turned out to be massive!  I've had them before from different places, and the standard sizing is much smaller.  Not here, and it came with vanilla gelato and delicious chocolate ganache.  I didn't get to inspect the gelato or even get the chance to ask for more ganache, because my friend pretty much inhaled most of the dish (and I can't blame him!).  The bread pudding was the complete opposite of the profiterole.  Granted, it's half the size of a normal serving, but was it TINY!  If I weren't allergic to the pecans I didn't know were included, I might've cared, but I enjoyed the two bites I had, and really, it was the salted caramel sauce that made this dessert shine.  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zCSkzDMeRKTWIrjw-j80hg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I definitely want to return to try some apps, an entree (or three!), and perhaps the Apple Crisp soon!",

    "text": "An illusion that somehow falls under the radar posing as quality but in reality falling short of even mediocrity.  I was looking for the perfect spot for us to check out while we were in Phoenix and figured yelp can't be wrong! Almost 5 stars - I was sure this would not disappoint! After all how can 300 reviews be off.  --The AMBIENCE Really nice and appreciated the lighting. Unfortunately there was a table of 4 men near us who were so loud that I could barely hear the person across from my very own table! The crowd skews a lot older - 60+   --The FOOD  Hamachi crudo I saw beautiful pictures of this and instead got mediocrity at best - soggy and sad looking. I would never ever order this again. Least the presentation was semi pleasant to look at.  Warm \"Bacon Candy\" with Frisee, Radicchio, Soft Poached Egg I'm not really sure why you need to sous vide an egg... the dish didn't make much sense to me because you have a lot of salad and just one eggs... it should have been a smaller portion salad, the bacon should have been chopped up and mixed with the salad. Instead you get one bite of egg, spending 5 minutes trying to grapple with cutting the bacon. The flavors make sense just not the final dish! Least there was an attempt here sort of...  Housemade Burrata with McClendon's Farm Tomatoes This is the saddest excuse for a buratta I have ever tried anywhere!! The inside of a buratta is supposed to be creamy and open to up as you cut it! This... was cold and as you open it you get farmers cheese! What the heck is this... we didn't send this back but I stopped eating after one bite - this was a sad excuse for trying to cook!  Octopus ravioli So this came out cold. The dough of the ravioli was disgusting - too thick and cold! I have never sent a dish back in all my years of dining but I was not going to pay almost $40 for cold ravioli!! What a disgrace! It's almost as if someone left them out sitting and the waiter was too busy to get them and like 10 min went by before they were served. They gave us 2 apps to apologize but even the apps were terrible. Also the 2 apps they gave us were shishito peppers that were not charred enough and greasy while the cauliflower app was so dry it was like crackers with random pieces of carrot on top... why??   --ChaChing I cannot believe how pricy this place is and that people actually pay this!! Like why? Is it location? This place is a complete rip off!!  --The LETdown I wouldn't send my worst enemy here! The food was pitiful, the price a joke and it just made no sense. I will never go here again and hope the food gets better. I should have known it was a red flag when they have so many types of cuisine on the menu! Why the heck do you have hummus as a starter? What does that have to do with anything? Get your stuff together! This restaurant has an identity crisis and I hope people start realizing this. I bet this place has regulars that come here often but how can they be so blind to the quality and price they are paying. Please please proceed with caution!  --The SERVICE Our waiter was pretty attentive even though it seemed like he had a lot of people to cover tonight. He was considerate when we had to send a dish back and very flexible. I was a little annoyed that the waiter kept pushing the most expensive dishes repeatedly - don't appreciate that!",

    "text": "We were invited to have dinner at Tarbell's by some friends who were in town for a weekend getaway. The restaurant was highly recommended to them by Geoffrey (The Concierge at the Biltmore where they were staying!).  Pre-dinner drinks at the bar (we were early) were nice with a very generous pour of Crown Royal from the bartender for me and a wonderful glass of Pinot Grigio for my wife! The atmosphere is relaxed and casual but leave your t-shirts and tennis shoes at home!   Once at our table, our waitress Wednesday was very helpful in making suggestions about food choices. The Butternut Squash Soup was excellent. Our food choices included; Scallops (excellent), Salmon (good), Chicken(Excellent) and the Fresh Mozzarella plate. In addition, Wednesday brought us over a few other dishes (on the house) for us to sample. Mac and Cheese and Brussels Sprouts. Now I love Brussels Sprouts anyway but these were to die for and while Mac/Cheese has never been one my favorites - YUM. Oh and the yellow beet salad was very pleasant departure from the typical salad.  Desserts here are for sharing and while the Creme Brulee was OK, the Southern Bread Pudding with Bourbon Sauce was excellent!  While we were eating Mark Tarbell did wander in and he made a point to visit every table and have a quick chat with all the diners that evening. An added bonus was meeting Geoffrey (who was picking up dinner to take home) and he insisted (that even though we were eating sweet stuff now) we try one of the meatballs that Tarbell's makes for their spaghetti and meatballs dish. Wow, that was excellent! I now know what I will be ordering next time we come here for an evening out.  I wouldn't say that this is a romantic place to dine at as the noise level did increase as more people arrived but, it is a great place to come for a meal. All in all this was a really nice dinner out and we'll have to treat ourselves to another visit in the future.",

I think I'd the pork chops back in 2005 and suggested one of my buddies to order it. I was fortunate enough to had a piece at medium rare and it was great! My two other friends had the ribeye and fish and both were up to par.   Tarbell's is one of my favorite restaurants in the greater Phoenix area. I will definitely come back here.

We passed by it earlier when driving and the strip mall is nothing to write home about.  In fact, it looks very 1970's.    I never thought there would be such a good restaurant in this mall.  The service is absolutely OUTSTANDING!  The water glasses never were more than half empty, food came out quickly (not pushy quickly), and the waitress did an AWESOME job describing the dishes.  She clearly is a foodie.  Being a foodie myself, I like hearing people describe food very expressively.    Wine - fantastic wine list!  We were looking at wines and the waitress recommended one which was fantastic.- Carpaccio - good and alot of it.  (it was a bit heavy on the salt and I love salt).  Mussels - you get a ton of them but the flavor wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected. The chicken sausage w/tomatoes, fresh pasta ribbons in a parmesean broth - EXCELLENT!   Bread - excellent.    My expectations were that of a 5 star restaurant, the experience was 5 stars, food 4 (only because of being an Iron Chef winner).    Menu is well rounded and offers many differen options - all farm fresh.",

    "text": "Possibly the best kept secret of Phoenix! With a somewhat smaller dining area as opposed to chain restaurants, this unique, upscale, fine dining establishment earns its keep on quality service to customers, not quantity of throughput.  It is a higher end restaurant, so if you expect that, then you won't get sticker shock.  Compared to other higher end fine dining, it's actually very reasonable with appetizers in the $20s and main courses in the $30s. We had a reservation through Yelp, so my table was ready when I arrived, which is always nice.  Also, there is valet parking service since the parking lot can be crowded, but I found a spot without a problem before I saw the valets.  We started our meal with the hamachi crudo appetizer, which was delicious! I don't know how they get such fresh fish in Arizona, but whatever they're doing is working! The service staff was very attentive and on their game, pulling plates as soon as we finished and bringing out the huge Diver Scallops next.  Again, it was absolutely scrumptious! My mouth is now watering just remembering how perfectly prepared it was. For the main course I enjoyed the delectable AZ honey glazed Scottish salmon with curried potato cake and a side of kale greens.  The salmon was perfectly prepared, and went very well with the sides and glaze.  The potato cake was delicious as well, but the kale really surprised me by how well prepared it was.  I wish I could get the chef's recipe because I've never been able to get kale to taste so good!  Finally, I finished the night with the apple puff pastry, which has flavors reminiscent of a country apple pie your grandma might have baked, but completely inside of a flaky pastry.  If you're looking for a classy, quiet restaurant with an amazing menu perfectly prepared and served to entertain an important client, take that special someone out, or just treat yourself, then look no further! I highly recommend this place, and can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Alright, so I went to this place with very high hopes. Yelpers raving about it, the place has all these awards, magazines are talking about it, there's an iron chef challenger/winner here, etc etc. With all the hype, I was a bit cautious, but still expecting to get my socks completely blown off. Was it a disappointment? I wouldn't go that far, the place is good. Service is awesome, food is high quality. But, it just isn't as great as what people will want you to think.   Like most of my foodie adventures with friends, we all had a cocktail. They were all good, and we sampled a large selection. I don't think anything from this bar would disappoint.   For food, we started with the crispy white beans. Very different, and that's why we got them. I still don't have a solid opinion on them, but they're strangely addicting. Salty, oily, cheesy, thyme-y. Give 'em a try, at least you can say you did. We also had the onion straws with Tarbell's \"Secret Sauce.\" These are good, I'd recommend them for a group appetizer, but just nothing that spectacular.  For the entree, obviously I had to try the scotch beef. This was pretty good. The gravy was amazing. The beef itself, though, is just a roast. I've had the same thing a thousand times at home. My mom could rival Mr. Tarbell's famous scotch beef anyday with a slow cooked roast, and she's no iron chef. Still, it was good and I would get it again. Tender, juicy, flavorful. The potatoes it sat on were good, too, but really the special part is the gravy.  Others at the table had salmon and the house ribbon pasta. Salmon was good, nothing out of this world. The pasta was also not super impressive, just nice, good quality food.  We couldn't resist dessert and got the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream. This was truly awesome. Creme brulee was also really quite good.   This review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the service and the atmosphere. This place really does a good job taking care of people. The server we had was amazing and all of the staff was super attentive. They know the menu, give good suggestions, and truly make you feel like a guest. This goes a long way nowadays in restaurants and in my opinion this alone gives them an extra star.  Speaking of stars, this place is really good. In no way does it deserve a 5-star review. 4 stars, sure, but they aren't getting it on food alone.",

I will certainly use this place for special occasions and a dinner night out.   One thing I almost forgot to mention, I ordered a special they had that day and there was an issue with the food that I wont say but again the manager came out personally and apologized for the mistake after I reordered  and actually took that item out of our dinner bill. And I have to say that was a very expensive meal and I was really impressed with the service. Thank you Tarbell",

The menu covers the gamut of tastes: seafood, beef, vegetarian... But doesn't show much creativity as compared to Citizen's Public House.  Service was impeccable and the kitchen was lightning fast. I'd definitely go here again without hesitation.  This isn't your sit and have a long drawn out meal where you're chatting and snaking for an hour or two. This is a quick, fun, energetic place to enjoy dinner before going to your next adventure.",

    "text": "My friend highly recommended the Cheesecake with Rosemary-Caramel sauce, so tonight because I was working late, I decided on a whim to call ahead and order some to take back to the office.  Over the phone they seemed to enjoy hearing that their cheesecake came so highly recommended (I don't think they are used to getting orders for just dessert). When I showed up to pick it up, the manager walked up and greeted me himself. He told me he was very happy that I came all the way there just for the cheesecake. He then discounted my order as an \"Early Christmas Present\". I was taken aback.  The cheesecake itself was amazing. They left the sauce on the side so it didn't get messy during travel. Consequently, I was to drizzle a little bit over each bite. The combination of the creamy cheesecake and the rich sauce was perfect. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.  I'll definitely be eating at Tarbell's for more than just dessert in the future. And although I can't tell you much about the atmosphere or the dining experience (yet) since I ordered to go, I can tell you that the manager there was extremely nice and everyone else I interacted with over the phone and in person was also wonderful.",

    "text": "Our first time at Tarbells was great! We happened upon the restaurant by luck after we were dismayed from the crowds/long wait at postino and LGO. Without reading a review,  we chose this place out of sheer hunger.   Our menu: Fish of the day - flute. A nice white fish dish,  good flavor,  just not quite enough flavor for the price.  House made ribbon pasta with sausage - delicious! Amazing flavor in the sauce,  perfect pasta,  tasty sausage.  Creme brulee - delicious!  Great portion to split between two or three. The hive (cocktail) - wonderful!  High end bourbon with rosemary and honey,  great combination.   Service: Our server was Martin - he was awesome.  Very attentive and showed up at all the right moments,  but not overbearing.    Cherry on the top - as we were leaving,  we were given little bags of popcorn!!! What!? Only because I'm a popcorn lover was this so impactful, but this little treat just tipped the experience from great to awesome!   Obviously if you're researching the restaurant you know it is on the pricey side. (Since we hungrily stumbled in,  we had no idea). But we were quite pleased with our experience and will be back again!",

Parking can be a tad bit difficult, but there is the option to valet the car if there aren't any open parking spots.  The restaurant itself looks fancy, but upon sitting down, I noticed that the tables are pretty close together, which makes the atmosphere seem loud and crowded.  While we were looking at the menu, we were brought out bread with four different toppings. The bread was warm and the hummus was an interesting option to eat with the bread.  My mother and I both ordered the seasonal chowda' and it was delicious! The fish was well-cooked, the mussels were delicious, and the broth was so flavorful. Bread dipped in the broth was such a delight! We also ordered the Brussels sprouts as a side. They were definitely charred, but weren't too flavorful in my opinion. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatball. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the giant meatball was easy to eat and there was no need for a knife! For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake and the apple and cinnamon cobbler. Both were absolutely delicious and we were so shocked that both desserts were on the house for my mom's birthday! Besides the loud atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion!",

    "text": "Truly breaks my heart this visit, I love Mark Tarbell and have an enormous amount of respect for him. I frequent his PBS show and he is a much more charismatic host than the previous Robert McGrath. It was a busy weekend night and our reservation was not quite ready so we had a drink at the bar.  Our table across from the bar was a glorified high top bar table difficult to share large plates. Server was friendly and professional yet seemed to sometimes glance over us when we had noticeably empty plates or water glasses on his voyages past our table. I understand they are busy and it truly has a European dining experience vibe to it because nothing is fast. FOOD.....My mouth was watering for the tuna tartar with deviled egg mousse and avocado, was sad to be informed after we ordered that they are out. So we ordered the calamari which was fantastic, light and crisp with a zesty salsa verde sauce, \"pizza of the moment\" was very good thin light crust with arugula and I am so sorry I forgot the meat I believe it was chorizo that created a zest. Georges bank scallops were very fresh, parsnip puree was not my favorite but they were so good on their own.  The NOT so good, I admit we were thoroughly confused at the salmon advertised as lime molasses glazed organic greens and a potato cake. In our mind a \"potato cake\" is a condensed potato dish often in the shape of a hockey puck for lack of better words. The dish arrived with what could only be described as hash browns all over the plate. Yep hash browns covered in salad topped with a salmon. The flavor was lacking in the salmon and quite frankly the \"potato cake\" tasted like Ore ida potatoes we could have picked up at Safeway. As a side we choose the au gratin potato which I hate to say it was very DISAPPOINTING. The potato had a thin bake on top but when we cut into it we initially thought it was raw, noticing the translucent color of the potatoes but luckily it was cooked it just had ZERO flavor, it was like eating bland mush. The little details were kind of annoying as well, like our server never took our menus including their impressively large wine menu that was nearly the size of our table (we were drinking cocktails that night) I guess it was good we were next to the window we just propped the menus on the sill......maybe our location did have its perks.",

    "text": "I have never had this happen before.  My daughter was in town for her and her mom's birthday which are one day apart and I wanted to take the family out for a nice dinner to celebrate.  We hadn't been to Tarbell's in a while so I thought it would be a good choice.  When we got to the restaurant my wife and I both commented that it was nice to see a good crowd with all of the new restaurants out there.  We had a group of 5 and were immediately seated for our 7:30 reservation That's where everything good ended.  Our server had an assistant with her who obviously was in training or something as he was not allowed to speak. As we had a fairly large group and the room was loud I asked him a couple of questions and he stated I needed to talk to the main server.  The server wasn't terrible but she did not seem as engaged and friendly as the service I had received in the past. She seemed a bit flustered and not on her game.  We ordered drinks and apps that seemed to take a little longer than I thought they should but not crazy considering how busy the restaurant was.  We had told the server that we were celebrating two birthdays and she said she would be providing us desert to celebrate.   She then took our dinner and wine orders.  About 15 minutes later she comes back with desert menus. I thought this was a bit odd but I thought maybe she was just trying to stay out in front of things.  About 10 minutes later the deserts that we ordered showed up at the table. Now I'm thinking this is very strange but we sat there to see what was next as we had not been served our entrees yet.  The server never came back to the table.   At this point we are done with this so I told the family to head to the car and I would take care of it.  I sat at the table by myself for another 5 minutes and nobody came by.  I finally got up to head out when I saw the server and a manager at the front desk talking about the situation that they now realized.  At this point I told them that I am going to assume that we are done here and I took my hungry family to another local restaurant.   Mark - I was pleased to see that your long standing restaurant continues to get the crowds but this unfortunate situation really put a damper on our what was supposed to be a family celebration. As you know there are several new options in the area which situations like this will make it difficult to consider your restaurant in the future.",

    "text": "Fun facts: Chef Tarbell was a winner on Iron Chef America and is the host of Check Please on PBS!  We were actually going to go to Vincent's but it turns out they are closed for the week. Since their bistro doesn't take reservations we didn't think to call and didn't realize they were closed until we had pulled into the parking lot and saw the notice on the door. A quick search led us to Tarbell's which I've had bookmarked for some time. So, it was Vincent's loss and Tarbell's gain for not being open this week!  The ambiance here is nice. The bar area looked like a fun place to have a drink and the formal dining area was pleasant with an open airy feel. I love the music they play in here too, a mix of some classic rock hits from artists like Queen and Guns & Roses.  The menu is one page and has a diverse selection to please many dining here. The items ranged from the more casual such as pizza, to surf and turf tenderloin with Jonah crab, and had a vegetarian selection \"prepared with the utmost care and delight\". Sounds very delightful for sure! The top of the menu also notes that they will try to accommodate any special requests guests may have.  There is also an extensive wine menu, and I love the fact that the wine menu is made out of cork. Such a creative touch!  I had the following:   Complimentary hummus and pita chips- The hummus had a strong cumin flavor. I like cumin, but it was spice overload for me. The pita chips were light and crisp, with a mix of cheese coated ones and regular plain. I do appreciate that it was a more unique complimentary starter compared to other restaurants that serve rolls or bread, as well as appreciation for the fact that it's free.  Watermelon berry gazpacho- There was something about the flavor that didn't quite sit well with me. For me I think it was the vinegar in the gazpacho, which drowned out the more crisp refreshing flavors of the berry and watermelon. It felt like I was sipping a thicker version of some cranberry-pear balsamic vinegar I used recently at home. I did like the little punch of spiciness from the inclusion of some chile in the soup though.  Beef carpaccio- The presentation was beautiful, with very thinly sliced beef, peppery arugula and a generous portion of shaved cheese. I enjoyed the combination of flavors for the most part but I didn't care for the thick flakes of salt in the dish since I'd get an occasional hit of pure salt granules while eating.  Halibut with scallop creme and charred tomato relish- the halibut was cooked perfectly, with a crispy nicely browned exterior and very tender flaky interior. The relish and scallop creme combined beautifully with the fish in flavors and textures. The only negative about the dish was that some of the really blackened charred bits from the tomato weren't fully removed so I got some pieces of crunchy bitter charred carbon in some bites.   Profiteroles- We split these and got one each on a plate. The two profiteroles are huge! The vanilla gelato was lightly sweet and delicious sandwiched in between the choux pastry. The chocolate ganache blanketed on top of the whole dessert was rich and decadent.   Service was good. Plates were taken away as needed and water was refilled constantly.  As we were about to leave the lovely hostess gave us each a cute little mini brownie to take home. Very nice!",

As my main course I ordered the roasted chicken (in the picture below). The chicken was fantastic, I would highly recommend it (it takes 4 days for them to make)! My family also enjoyed their meals. My only issue was the dessert menu, they didn't have a classic dessert like cookies, brownies, molten cake, etc. And as we left they handed us small brownies instead of mints, I wish they would have put that brownie on the menu instead.   **As a side note, the service was fantastic! Our server was super helpful, nice, and funny.",

    "text": "It's obvious that the menu is carefully planned and tuned however that is where the nice experience ends.  We have been a couple of times hoping that it would get better but each time it was just worse than the last. Even though we have a reservation each time we still end up having to wait.  Per the front of house staffs suggestion we have each time gone to the already overcrowded (directly by the front door) bar and ordered a drink from the overworked bartenders.    This past experience included a server and server in training and the two were OBVIOUSLY not getting along so I basically paid a lot of money to be made to feel awkward by the staff.  The pizza appetizer was okay but the Scotch beef was excellent in all fairness.    The clincher on why this time was the last...  Not once but twice there were patrons that went out on the porch and were smoking and OF COURSE this wafts into the restaurant.  The first time the staff did nothing for so long that a bar patron got up and actually asked the men to move.  They moved, wasn't that hard.  The second time the staff notified the manager by pointing at the man smoking right outside the door and he waved them away and walked away, doing nothing.  Even the bartenders were complaining loudly enough that I could hear them from my table.  So we all just sat in his smoke smell ruining any flavor the food probably did have.    Disgusting. `",

In fact, the chefs will create anything for you, and the service is impeccable! Everyone is so warm and relaxed. They make you feel right at home as you experience the elegance and evidence of a restaurant owned and operated by an Iron Chef America Champion and all of the national awards. Choosing a wine is effortless since Mark Tarbell is a wine connoisseur (has a wine store next door, writes a wine column) and has the perfect pairings or suggestions.  The Gnocchi with Lobster is spectacular! It had the freshest, sweetest tomatoes cooked to perfection, just like the gnocchi & lobster, in a light creamy sauce.   Their Creme Brulee is exquisitely smooth with the perfect amount of vanilla, a flawless layer of caramelized sugar, and big fresh berries.   I also have to mention their special touches, like their housemade Tahini cumin hummus and chips, when we were seated, and the individually wrapped lemon cookies as we left. Our friends, who dined there last week, received individually wrapped pieces of banana bread as they left.  Tarbell's is very special and innovative, upscale yet relaxed.",

I had originally planned for 22, but 2 could not make it last minute - 20 people is still a huge crowd and yet the service was flawless. So incredibly grateful for all they did to make this event memorable. I highly recommend this location for any large events you may have.

We usually eat dinner at the bar - but arriving at 5:30 - the bar was packed on this particular Friday night.  With still some seats available for dinner inside, before the big rush - we opted to sit outside and and enjoy the 70+ degree weather.  Turned out to be a great call.  The hostess who sat us at our cute little table said, 'wow, it's nice and quiet out here..' and even Fernando, our waiter, said, 'it's so nice to be out here!'.  We started with 'brown liquor':  an Old Fashioned and a Manhattan.   Both fantastic.  We checked out the extensive dinner choices ('Seasonal' and 'Non-Seasonal') and couldn't really decide on what to order.  Our attentive waiter offered up the KEY for ordering:  1/2 and shared portions! UNBELIEVABLE!  You have to do it!  We shared Salmon, Alaskan Halibut  and Bolognese for our main dishes. Where can you do that at a nice restaurant - and at a reasonable price!?  Look over their menu - and hear the daily specials, and if you can't decide - no worries - try a few!!  We joked after dinner:  between the cocktail, 3 dishes and the bottle of wine - how can do we rate what was best?  Well, YOU CAN'T!!  Everything was memorable and delicious!  Amazing experience and you must give it a try.  Don't forget our tip - sharing is KEY!  So much fun - such good food!  Cheers!",

When it came time to order dessert, we couldn't decide, and the waiter said \"one is on us, just get both!\" We did, and I have to say, the chocolate mousse was the standout of the two.

The house bread that was served was especially good and served warm - mmm.  Our table ordered mac and cheese and onion strings to share. Both were super delicious, the onion strings came with a phenomenal dipping sauce that I loved. For my entree, I ordered one of the homemade pasta dishes which was very rustic and delicious, although the chicken sausage was a bit heavy handed with the fennel seeds. The others at my table ordered the special of the night that was some sort of fish and polenta that looked great. My fiance ordered the scotch beef which he loved as well.   We also all ordered dessert, carrot cake (meh, I've definitely had better), chocolate mousse (pretty good, but standard), bread pudding with a bourbon sauce (super rich, pretty good), and homemade sorbets (the lemon being the best and very refreshing).   I would say definitely check this place out, especially for special occasions.",

The Mr. Fish of the Day was a Skate and was interesting and unusual and well presented. Their Bolognese (that takes 4 days to make) was the best I have ever had. It is served with fresh homemade flat noodles and was delicious. There is an extensive wine cellar to complete the meal. Prices range from $16-39 per entree and the evening for 2 with a beverage was $90. We highly recommend it and will definitely return.",

    "text": "I give this place a 3 with the hopes of returning and giving it a 4 or 5.   My wife and i had the spinach dip, bolognese, and a 35 day aged peppercorn steak.  In addition to our order, our server presented us with a complimentary burrata appetizer, as it was our first time to the restaurant. Whole tomatoes are my least favorite vegetable (or fruit, whatever, shut up) I appreciated the gesture and the cheese mixture was quite good.   Spinach dip: not actually a dip, like chips and dip, but I probably would have realized that if I actually read the menu. Its a puff filled with spinach and though unexpected was very good.   Bolognese: I only had a bite but it had good flavor, so I can't comment much more than that.   Steak: they offer steaks either grilled or peppered. Should have gone with my gut and just gotten the grilled steak, but went on a limb for the peppered. I ordered medium rare; in my opinion it was slightly overcooked but I do like steaks quite rare so I didn't complain. The steak itself had great flavor, but delite what the server said it had a much stronger pepper flavor than I was expecting.   In addition to the entrees we had pomme frites (fries) and Brussels sprouts.  The fries were nothing special. They were fried potatoes, as expected. But you can get better fries at any fast food restaurant.   Sprouts: definitely overcooked. They looked almost completely black, basically no green left, little flavor left besides the charring. But, mixed with the sprouts were caramelized white onions which basically saved the dish. Cook them a few minutes less and they would be absolutely terrific.   Overall, I give service 4 stars. Server was knowledgeable but could have been just a tad quicker with drink refills. The ambiance is great, and it may have just been timing but when we pulled up there were 2 Bentley's and a Rolls parked in front (good thing we borrowed the in laws' car so we fit in).   I would return to try the non-peppered grilled steak or the lamb, but for my current visit I would have to give 3 out of 5.  Definitely give it a shot. It was not a bad experience at all",

    "text": "My wife and I went here for our 15th Wedding Anniversary dinner. We chose the place specifically because of Mark Tarbell's reputation as a chef.  Everybody makes mistakes. It is how you handle them that shows what kind of a person you are. In the restaurant business, it's that attitude that turns a \"we won't be back\" into \"we'll definitely be back!\"  The story:  We arrived for our reservation and were promptly seated. We started with the Kale Chips as a starter, and both quite liked them.  I ordered the scallops and my wife had the halibut special. My wife's was excellent, she was very happy. My scallops were fairly underdone -- cutting into each of them it was clearly raw in the middle. The garnish of pea tendrils and morels was fantastic.  I informed a passing employee (I thought she was a hostess) as our waiter was busy with a large table,  and she agreed with a quite surprised look that they were definitely undercooked.  When I got the plate back, it had been reheated and not refired...I was a little surprised to have them reheated (at $38 a plate) instead of a refire, but they were well cooked now and quite good.  I informed the waiter after I'd finished that the round small potatoes had also been a bit underdone but edible, probably because the garnish was rushed by the undercooked scallops. To be honest, the waiter kind of ignored us a bit after this.  The employee that I'd returned my dinner to came back and apologized again. It turns out she was a manager, and she informed us that she was comping my dinner, as well as two deserts of our choice.  The deserts, by the way, were outstanding! My wife had the creampuffs and I had vanillabean cheesecake with a very unique and tasty rosemary caramel sauce.  After dinner, the owner and Chef, Mark Tarbell came by. He said that mistakes didn't happen often, but that he wanted to make sure it was properly resolved, and he apologized and specifically thanked me for bringing a mistake to his attention.  I said that it had, and I was happy, and my wife specifically told Chef Tarbell how pleased she was with manager's response and attitude.  We'll definitely be back to Tarbell's both because of the food (which was excellent, and that they fixed the error quickly) and the customer service!",

Tarbell's is the perfect restaurant for a special location, or if you simply want a bit of joy in your evening.  Menu is varied with appetizer/ side dishes satisfying for a main course also. The carpaccio is the best in the valley, with an original presentation. The waiters allow you to savor a bottle of wine with small pours & frequent attention to the table.   Last night we tried a bacon candy salad. The bacon and radicchio didn't initially appear to match but Beau and I devoured it. Watching the service was impressive as they hustled with completing orders, interacting with the customers or cleaning every component of their area. ( Never will you see a waiter/ bartender checking a phone or texting away. )  Thus, fantastic flavorful dishes. Acoustics pair the happening hum behind the needed intimacy for a conversation. Service is friendly & professional.",

Now I recall why, and will certainly never dine at TARBELL'S ever again! To our surprise they were celebrating the truffles of Perigord that night. So the truffled risotto with seared medium rare scallops sounded wonderful! Or so we thought! To have the audacity of serving basmati rice in a watery cream sauce and call that risotto is a travesty! And more so, the arrogant 25 year old waiter came over and sliced the truffles over the dish and the perfume was non existent! Meaning the truffles were old and certainly not winter Perigord truffles! Two slices of winter Trufles from Perigord would perfume a 10 foot area in seconds. Hell, summer Oregon truffles would have been 100 times better that the crap they called Truffles from Perigord! It does not matter that I am a graduate of The Culinary Institute of America, class of 1991. How in Gods name can you serve basmati rice in a cream sauce and call it risotto!?!? And when I called the manager over, the little twit tried bluffing me by saying, the Chef ran out of arborio rice and substituted basmati. Really, when there is a Safeway an 1/8 of a mile away, you couldn't find any bloody arborio rice??? So, it is extremely sad that Mark Tarbell and his bullshit James Beard award can call himself a Chef when what I just detailed is his fingerprint for \"fine dining\" in Phoenix. ZERO stars is more applicable!",

I haven't eaten scallops in years after an icky food poisoning incident but I had to try a bite and they were melt-in-your-mouth nummy. Tasted more like lobster than scallops even.  I was torn as to what to order but I settled on the Pan-roasted Chicken and I was far from disappointed. It was, by far, the juiciest, best prepared chicken dish I've ever had.   All told, it was a perfect evening. The atmosphere felt a tad dated but it almost made it all the more charming... kinda like we were stepping back in time a bit.",

I never send back a dish, So instead we got the peas and carrots which were drenched in butter. Again served before the meal! Why?? Than the meal. The halibut was dry, and had zero taste. The chef also forgot the sopreseta. And the waitress argued that it was there. Awful. The salmon was subpar, sitting on top of a oil drenched potato latke.

Alright, I have to vent...I come from a family of skilled borscht chiefs!!! ;) While the dish Tarbell's called borscht was pretty good it was by no means borscht. Does that make sense? Well, if you're Ukrainian, Russian, Polish or some sort of Slavic it will. The Cornish game hen was really delicious, seemed like the perfect meal for a cool fall day. Crap, this is Phoenix and it doesn't cool off until December!! Sorry, got a little carried away with my fantasy. Back to the meal - the desert was amazing!

Two poor dishes, we will not go back. The server was great however. I am sad to write this, maybe the amercian dishes are better.",

Mom's seafood chowder sounded like it would be full of mussels and there were hardly any. Dad got the spaghetti and meatballs and he compared it to Chef Boyardee. The chocolate mousse was outstanding but the ice cream in the profiteroles was gelatinous. Also, in our reservation, I left a note to the maitre d' that obviously wasn't passed along to our server. She did a great job, but it was disappointing that we had to fill her in.",

    "text": "We went there Saturday.  I had the cast iron-seared pepper steak.  My wife had the Swordfish special.  I also had  1/2 order of the Tuna Tartare and she had  1/2 order of Mussels and we split a Cesar salad.  The Tuna was tasty as were the Mussels.  There was nothing special about the Cesar.  Both main courses were TERRIBLE.  The Steak had no flavor.  Neither my wife or I can figure out how anyone can take a piece of meat like that and prepare it to the point where it is completely without taste.  I almost asked for steak sauce, or ketchup or anything to give it \"something\".  Fortunately, Salt fixes everything.  The creamed spinach is still a mystery.  Usually creamed spinach is chopped and has a cream sauce.  Spinach that is simply Boiled or Steamed spinach IS NOT creamed spinach.  The au gratin potatoes were dry as if they had been sitting, for hours, just waiting for a victim.  The Swordfish was equally as bad.  It had absolutely  no flavor and the consistency of a cardboard.  Her bustle sprouts did have some flavor since they were burned and tasted like charcoal.  We are still AMAZED that anyone had the skills necessary to turn two pieces of meat into completely flavorless ... I don't believe words exists to describe these bland \"creations\".  She was really excited about going to Tarbells, as was I and because of that, we were really let down.  Again, it wasn't just bad, it was TERRIBLE.   That was Saturday and we are still talking about how awful the food was at Teribells.  Now only was the food is Awful!!!!, Teribels is located in a terrible location, and we were lucky to get a parking spot.   We were so looking forward to a night of fine dining, instead, we got a bill for $103.00 for the worst tasting food either of us has ever endured.",

    "text": "A chef that can do great things with brussels sprouts always get major points with me, second only to one that can make creamy soups not laden with cream. Mark Tarbell does both exceptionally.   On our last visit, I broke tradition of ordering the special of the night and opted for the chicken. Yes, big deal one thinks ... think again. There is something magical in that bird, a perfect balance of salt and crispiness. When available, I go ga-ga for the lamb with brussels sprouts and french lentils. Another must is the duck confit appetizer. Heaven.   I typically don't bother with the pizza -- it is good, but not really an attraction. The by-the-glass list has several good selections, including a very well priced sparkling. The waitstaff is efficient, professional and friendly, something of a rarity even among many \"upper echelon\" establishments in the Valley. Yes, parking can be a bitch at that plaza, and yes, parts of the menu are a tad bit weather worn ... but sometimes there is nothing wrong with a little comfort food.",

He tried the spaghetti and meatballs-didn't like it at all.  Felt that the sauce was a little bland and watered down.  I ordered the filet-which came out perfect and melted in my mouth-so good.  The manager came by and asked how our food was-I encouraged hubby to be honest.  He was.  They apologized profusely.  He then ordered the pan roasted chicken-loved it.  They also offered to make me a new meal since it was Valentine's Day and \"i shouldn't have to eat alone.\"  Hubby didn't mind so I kept eating.  Mark Tarbell came by after the chicken came out to make sure it was to hubby's liking.  What do you say to the owner/Iron Chef?  Hell yeah he liked it!  In the end the wonderful manager at Tarbells comp'd our ENTIRE meal-4 glasses of wine, salads, appetizer and meals!  He said he did this since it was Valentines Day and they wanted the night to be perfect for us.  You don't come across such great service everyday.",

The meatballs were some of the best I've ever tasted and the pork chop was definitely in the top three pork chops I've ever had.

My father and asked to sub the rice for roasted brussel sprouts on the swordfish and our waitress brought us the swordfish with just brussel sprouts. It took us a while to be able to flag our waitress down and get the other parts added to the dish. Those parts were pretty critical to the dish (pretty bland without them) and she really should've clarified in case she misunderstood (which she did).",

    "text": "Another amazing meal accompanied by amazing service! We started with sharing the caprese salad and beet salad, both very good. The homemade burrata was very creamy on very fresh plum tomatoes with a light pesto sauce. The beet salad with arugula was even better. The sweetest beets with fresh crisp arugula and creamy goat cheese with a very light dressing both were so large I was able to take some of the beet salad home to enjoy. For our entrees my husband had the NY strip; very tender, cooked perfectly medium rare delicious with a Cabernet reduction. He loved the accompanying  sides of creamed spinach and freshly cut, crispy pommes frites. I tried both and they were very good. The spinach wasn't overly creamed like some, just very light and perfectly seasoned. I had the gnocchi with lobster which had spinach and tomatoes in a light Parmesan cream sauce. It had several large pieces of lobster. Some pieces were large enough to cut with a knife and the lightest tender gnocci. We also had some additional sides, peas with multi-colored carrots all fresh and cooked perfectly still had some crispness and my favorite the tempura cauliflower, so crispy and delicious. I don't think I want to eat cauliflower any other way! For dessert we shared the cheesecake and it is wonderful! Light and airy but still very creamy and cheesy. Everything is large portions so we had plenty of take home boxes which made the next very special. Our waiter Allen was personable and really payed attention to all of requests taking notes along the way. He was attentive without be over-bearing. The perfect dinner. We will be back.",

The dining room is excessively cramped, and LOUD. I hate hearing every detail of the neighbors table! Zero privacy whatsoever. Otherwise, the ambiance is nice enough. The bar area is nice. The food was good, but I'm really getting tired of seeing restaurants serve such oversized portions. It's offensive. And and a waste of food. Just stop it!

I had the famous spaghetti and meatball (I love spaghetti), it wasn't bad, just not superb enough to leave a famous impression in my mouth. The wine in the sauce could've definitely used some more reduction.  The rock shrimp app was ok. The house made mozzarella was really the star of the day. It was silky and rich and everything anyone could hope for in a mozzarella.  My partner had the scallops. They were cooked ok, could've used a bit more of a sear, but they were flavorful. The risotto bed they were on was not so flavorful. It was a bit too al dente  and lacked seasoning. To be fair we had just had an amazing sweet corn risotto the week before made by Justin Beckett that may have ruined our risotto experience for every place else from here on out.  The vanilla cheesecake was my favorite part of the meal. It was as creamy as the cheese and was not overwhelmingly sweet.  The service was, as to be expected, very good.",

Excellent service (the waiters even helped accommodate (move) me when a lady came in with overly strong perfume -- seriously folks, go easy on the chemical smells).   The food is delicious, and they have been able and willing to meet my dietary restrictions with delicious fare.   And, although the place is great, I've never come dressed better than semi-nice and that is perfectly acceptable. Highly recommend.",

The mozzarella was soft, creamy and very flavorful. We than had the rock shrimp ravioli.  The ravioli dough was a little heavy and the shrimp lacked flavor.  Next I had the meatball piazza and my wife had the roast chicken.  The chicken was wonderful, the skin crisp and the meat moist and burgeoning with flavor. My piazza was good but am a piazza fanatic and had a few issues with the pie.  The pie was good as were the meatballs but the sauce was a stew/barbecue gravy rather than pure tomato base. It ruined the pie for me!  The biggest issue was the price, for the quality and location it is OVERPRICED.  Appetizer were $15 to $20 and main courses averaged $30!  The piazza was $14.  Overall it gets 3 stars, I would go back but be careful least I ordered!",

We overindulged and ordered 4 different starters, all of which were fantastic. My personal favorite was the maple candied bacon served with a softboiled egg, don't leave without trying that one!   For dinner my favorite was the scotched beef, but I'll admit I tried some of everything on the table of which I recommend their scallops as well as the thickly cut New York strip.   For dinner I highly recommend the carmel covered cheesecake which the whole group sampled.  The price may prevent me from eating there every night, but you pay for what you get, and this was completely worth it.",

We started off with a nice glass of wine - mine was an amazing French rose - and an order of the mac 'n cheese (so creamy and delicious)!  For my meal, I thoroughly enjoyed the scottish salmon with a molasses lime glaze over a potato cake and greens and my hubby enjoyed his peppercorn NY strip with a side of brussel sprouts.  I can guarantee we won't wait another 10 years before frequenting Tarbell's again...this place is just so consistently good!",

It gives us a reason to be foodies and out do each other with who is gonna pick which place in the valley to try next. On this night, we were celebrating the day we started dating and Valentines Day a tad early due to upcoming travel due to work. We both had made reservations here ! Ha! I had never been here, despite that just a few years ago I lived practically next door. I canceled my reservation , we kept his. We arrived and I immediately loved the decor which is what I thought it would be: upscale; classy clientele; white linen table cloths. This place was busy on a Thursday night! My tip: always make a reservation in advance! Our table was in the corner at the window and our server was Nathan. We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir from home and the Crispy Rock Shrimp. It was a super, generous portion of shrimp and was cut into bite sized morsels. The sauce had a bit of a citrusy asian taste to it. We loved this as a starter. I ordered the Scotch Beef for my entree; and the Caesar with Kale and Romaine to go with and for balance. My husband's first choice of entree was Tar's Beef Stroganoff with Gnocchi. He really wanted this , as he is a gnocchi king! Nathan, advised us that he thought they may be out of this entree and what would his second option be , in case? That was a bummer.. and would have been a nice point made at the beginning when Nathan discussed the menu with us. Scott said he would go with the Fish of the Moment, which was a lightly sauteed sea bass. We didn't know what was showing up until it arrived! The salad was divine and very good. I could have made a meal of that alone. It was a generous portion and the kale wasn't too much as sometimes kale can be in salads. The dressing was just enough and not too heavy. The Scotch Beef... OMG.. to die for. It's like a delectable hunk of beef amassed delicious mashed potatoes, a velvety rich gravy and fresh cut green beans. This dish is rich, gluten free, generous in portion and so delicious. I took half of it home! Because it was our 'anniversary' to a degree and I had also let the restaurant know on MY reservation that my husband was celebrating a major milestone with his company, Nathan brought us the Cheesecake with Rosemary Caramel Sauce. I am not really one for cheesecakes , THIS is like NO other cheesecake I had ever had. It's perfect and round.. topped with this amazing, rich, and different caramel sauce with a hint of rosemary.. paired with the perfect Port.. Voila! Perfecto! I can see why Mark Tarbell was the Iron Chef and why this amazing restaurant has all the accolades it does.. ! I can't wait for another reason to go back! Don't forget to grab your popcorn on the way out :--)",

So, of course I had high expectations going in.  So when my friends Jared and Jane B suggested we do a double date at Tarbell's during the recent AZ Restaurant Week, I was totally game.  Upon walking into Tarbell's, the hostess was incredibly friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was warm and inviting while still being casual; my kind of place!  Nathan was our waiter and he was awesome.  He was patient with both my husband and our friend Jared as they went back and forth on what they wanted to order quite a few times.  He suggested a great bottle of wine for us also.  I was the only one at the table who didn't order off of the restaurant week menu.  I went with a Caesar salad to start, the Salmon entree, and carrot cake for dessert.  I enjoyed the Caesar salad despite the lack of anchovies (I happen to love anchovies).  The salmon was a huge hit -- I think everyone at the table had order envy over it -- but I did share!  It was grilled to perfection, topped with a local molasses/lime/honey glaze and served on a crispy potato cake.  The carrot cake was good but not amazing.  The restaurant week menu that everyone else ordered from had only one starter option: the pulled mozzarella.  However, I guess they ran out of it the night that we were there, so the manager came over and offered to substitute with other salad options.  This was a huge perk for everyone and much appreciated by our group.  Two people at our table had the Bolognese, but they said it was bland.  They were pleased with the other desserts (donuts and chocolate mousse).  While I wasn't completely enamored with everything, our overall Tarbell's experience was a good one, and I definitely want to return to try more menu items in the future.  Double date or biz dinner, anyone?  Let me know!",

When my husband made the reservation, he mentioned that it was a special birthday for me, and they assured him they would make it special for me.  We were both so excited to try it.  The hostess greeted us and was cheerful and pleasant wishing me a Happy Birthday.  And them comes the waitress.  She was extremely stone faced and unfriendly with absolutely no personality.  Made us feel uncomfortable from the moment she came.  We both enjoyed our dinners.  The food was good, but overpriced.  When it came to having dessert, the waitress rudely put the dessert menu near the edge of the table and walked away.  No Happy Birthday, no comment, nothing!  We chose not to order dessert and my husband made the comment to her \"it's her birthday and she doesn't even want dessert\", just to see what she would say.  She abruptly took the menu from us and said in a solemn voice, \"Oh, Happy Birthday\", and walked away.  Totally rude!!  We've had better servers at inexpensive diners.  Will not be back!!!!",

We came to the restaurant with our young autistic son who is very high functioning and is a hamburger nut. It was clear he frustrated the waiter even more! We had to wait for a drink quite a while so I got up to go to the bar to order. I wasn't upset as I recognized our waiter was dealing with an order issue at another table that was clearly not his doing. Nonetheless, it clearly set his mood off.  As for the food, I had the peppercorn steak and for appetizer the octopus. My wife had soft shell crabs and as an appetizer the beef carpaccio. The food across the board was amazing and cooked to perfection.  My wife and I said we would definitely come back but sit in a different section of the restaurant.   My wife and son came back into town yesterday so I booked a dinner here again tonight because we liked the food so much and we wanted to give it another try on the service. . Tonight was spectacular in every way from the manager coming up to the table to thank us us for coming again to the waiter and of course the food.

    "text": "Delish!  This is an upscale, top notch restaurant - excellent service, high quality food, beautiful menu. I had the Scotch Beef, which is one of their house specialities. Not only was it gluten free, but the beef melted in my mouth and the portion was very generous.  As an appetizer, we tried the tuna tartar and beef carpaccio. The tuna was cool and refreshing. The beef was a little hard to pry off the plate, which would have been fine if it was just my hubby and I, but I felt a little awkward picking at it with another couple there. I'm not sure if anything can be done about that.   The server was knowledgeable and professional. He was there when we needed him but never lurked (in that creepy way that sometimes happens elsewhere). I told him upfront that I was GF and he steered me away from a few dishes that had hidden gluten. He also works in The Wine Store by day and was able to recommend a beautiful pinot noir for us out of Napa (St. Joseph's).  We enjoyed the mixed berries with lemon meringue as a shared desert. This portion was on the small side, but absolutely mouth-watering. We each enjoyed a bite or two with our post-dinner port or coffee drink. It was wonderful ending to a delicious dinner.  Tip: every meal (except the pizzas) may be ordered as half orders. This is great if you can't decide between two entrees!",

Appetizers consisted of a bacon salad, rich in taste and presentation. Carpaccio delicately sliced and melted in your mouth. Shrimp nicely seasoned. For staters some ordered a salad which was plated with care was crispy and the dressing not overpowering. Most of us ordered their special cauliflower soup. It was served hot and so creamy, it just exploded with taste once it hit your taste buds.  For dinner entrees consisted of the scallops, skate fish and a chief made  vegetarian dish. All who ordered the shrimp was satisfied and said their dish was cooked just right. The skate fish dish on the other hand was not as well liked. The vegetarian dish was out of this world. The different ingredients blended but also complimented each other. Desert was brought on the table no questions asked. If you eat it you pay for it. All deserts were with the money. Rich in taste and calories. All in all this place is worth it. Just know it is on the expensive side.",

Matt had their scotch beef and it was tender and perfectly cooked- he described it at succulent with a flavorful burgundy sauce. The real winner was their marscapone cheesecake- OMG!

My mom and I went here on the first night of a week-long trip to AZ, and the food we ate for the rest of the trip just made us yearn to go back.    I think that first and foremost I have to rave about the service, which was stellar.  Our waitress Jillian should open a school for servers.  She was friendly, VERY knowledgeable about the menu (including the cocktails -- get the violet one!), and super attentive.  She was key in making our experience as good as it was.  Thank you, Jillian!  I thought the food was amazing.  Put it this way: there were, not one, but two sauces that my mom and I agreed we would like to bathe in.  The parmesan broth on the home-made ribbon pasta dish was indescribably good, and the rosemary caramel on the (outstanding) cheesecake was truly delicious.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the fried capers on the tartare are extra-special good.  Just go!",

    "text": "So Tarbell's is a nice place to eat, with friendly people, and a good neighborhood crowd. The servers, the bussers, the hostesses, everyone is nice. I can't stress that enough.  We were ridiculously excited to try the food, after hearing so much about it for so long. It was like the excitement you get when someone tells you they are taking you on vacation to the most beautiful place on earth but you don't know where. You know, when you just are awaiting something spectacular but you don't really know how spectacular?  The mussel appetizer was outrageous. There was a bowl of probably 50 of the biggest meatiest suckers I'd ever seen. Served with a garlic butter broth that I ordered more and more bread just to sop up... it was amazing. We went straight to the main courses afterward, which were much less appetizing to look at, and even more so to eat. I ordered the Ahi Tuna, which was served in three cubes, very similar to a tuna tartare appetizer. Served dusted in smokey paprika, it was almost as if I were eating paprika rather than fish. Needless to say, it was a huge disappointment. The girlfriend's spaghetti and meatballs, something Tarbell's is known for we hear, were nothing more really than spaghetti and meatballs. Then again, what all can you do with spaghetti and meatballs that nobody else has done? The side of mac n' cheese was well, mac n' cheese.   Desserts were somewhat a saving grace, but only moderately. I had the bread pudding and enjoyed it well enough. It was sitting in a very bourbony sauce and carried a great aroma and texture.   All in all, I'd say Tarbell's is serving two things... standard fare with higher quality ingredients (mac n' cheese, spaghetti and meatballs, bread pudding) along with experimental dishes that are hit or miss (ahi tuna, mussels) to overall garner a good but not great review from me. I'm sorry, but I just don't see it. If I order a piece of fish, I want it to taste like fish, not a paprika lick.",

The hostess was very friendly and waitress was nice. (that is worth the 1 star I gave them) My wife's meatballs were disgusting.  It looked greasy and stank of Red wine.  I tied a taste and literally spit it out.  It had too much oil and wine and not enough flavor.  I had the Pan-Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops.  The were cook extremely well but the rest was very bland.

    "text": "Last month, while at a conference in Phoenix, a group of about 16 of us made reservations and went to Tarbell's. I had heard great things about this place and being a bit of a foodie, I was excited about it. I began to worry because... well, you know when you build something up in your head and it doesn't live up to what you are expecting? Two months is a lot of anticipation!  I was lucky enough to be seated with four other people that were big foodies too, which was perfect. We all loved food and, even better, we liked to share. Score! Still... would it live up to the hubbub? I've only watched Iron Chef a few times, but had no idea the chef had won it, quite honestly. Had I, I probably would have skipped the restaurant, honestly. I'm glad I didn't because this was one of those meals that I will remember for a good long time. One of the ladies at my table was also from Austin (where I'm from) and we are still working out how we can get Mr. Tarbell to move here (hey, if you're reading this, Mark, Austin is a super cool city... just sayin').  We tried many of the things on the menu, I'll share my favorites...   For the table we ordered the Brussels Sprouts as well as the Shisitho Peppers. I'm not a pepper fan, but those that liked them said they were well done. The sprouts were perfectly cooked and we managed to convert one person in our group that claimed they did NOT like them. Heh, apparently she loves them now. For salads, I tried a few, but my favorite was the beet salad. Absolutely must get this. It was amazing, the goat cheese was mild and the flavors blended beautifully. The house pulled mozzarella was also very good.  For the main course, I had the Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna (rare). OMG. I have had quite a bit of ahi in my life, but this was, easily, the best. It simply melted in your mouth. The nicoise on the side was a perfect compliment to bring out the flavor for the fish as well as the potatoes that were served on the side. I also got to enjoy some of the salmon (divine) and house-made ribbon pasta (absolutely wonderful). The stand out for me was definitely the ahi, but really adore tuna, if done correctly.  We also skipped dessert. Until we saw the menu. None of the four of us could decide on any one thing, so we each ordered something and then passed them around in circles. We got a few laughs, but hey, you only live once, right? I must say that the desserts were all simply amazing (and huge!). The stand out was the mascarpone cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce (Oh my, I wonder if my spouse would think it odd if I booked a trip back there JUST to get a slice of this cake - Psssst, the recipe is on their website though!). We also had the bread pudding, which I was leery of, but it was, again, absolutely amazingly well done. We had the apples (which I didn't get to try, I'm allergic, but everyone said they were so very good) and the profiteroles (which one of my table mates had a bit of a When Harry Met Sally moment over). *laugh*  The staff were attentive, answering our many questions. We never felt rushed and spent a good time talking and enjoying the company. The restaurant itself seems very unassuming in a small strip mall type of area. Parking looks like it could be a bit of a problem (we took a hotel shuttle). The place is a bit on the loud side, but nothing we needed to scream over. I would not hesitate to bring my husband or business folks here again. Though, definitely not a place for kids.  Thank you, Tarbell's, for a memorable evening of good food, good atmosphere and good fun.",

Made reservations for same day - within an hour and because it was Thurs night, we were able to get it.  Probably wouldn't work on a Fri/Sat!  The food was delicious, the service impeccable.  And Mark Tarbell was such a gracious host, came to our table a couple of times - it was our anniversary and he wanted us to have dessert on the house.  The Summer bouillabaisse my husband had was wonderful, and my ribbon pasta with fennel chicken sausage was superb!  We had their new menu item as a  starter:  grilled peaches, bacon, balsamic, etc.  A WONDERFUL summer starter, light but what a great flavor combo!  All in all couldn't have asked for a better dinner with a great staff!  Only downside was when we actually ordered 2 desserts, that was 1 too much for 2 people - other portions were perfect, desserts are LARGE!  But we couldn't decide between the classic chocolate mousse (YUMMY!) and the Bread pudding with Kentucky Bourbon sauce -so we ordered both.  And both were outstanding - but TOOO BIG!!!  OK so that's not really a bad thing!!!!",

    "text": "My wife and I had reservations there last night.  Poor choice! Not a bad place to eat, but a terrible dining experience.   Parking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!  I dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice.   The soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered.   My bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff.   I had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved.   Dessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong.   The ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours.   I suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.  The check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either.   To his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that \"the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished\". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.  This place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered.   Sorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience.",

    "text": "Every time I come to Phoenix, I like to try a new upscale restaurant , this time Tarbell's looked really appealing, I wasn't overly impressed, but I did get a decent meal.   First of all, the parking situation here is terrible, the strip mall it's in has another restaurant and a bar, so save some time and sanity, opt for the valet.  The hostess was nice, we had reservations but still had to wait a bit for our table. This place was busy and loud, a lot louder than I would have expected. The tables were way too close together. If you were lucky enough to get one of the stand alone tables, it might be ok, but we were sitting along the wall and it was way too cramped.   We had a couple of appetizers, both good. The caprese salad tasted good, but was not remarkable. The calamari was cooked perfectly and came with two really nice dipping sauces.   We ended up getting the appetizers before we even ordered dinner so we had to hang on to our unwieldy menus while trying to eat our appetizers since there was no room to place them on the table.  Dinner was good, not great. 2 in our group got the pepper steak, (Steak au poivre) it was tasty. The creamed spinach was more of a sauteed than creamed. I had the double cut pork chop. This was really good. It came with a couple of pierogi filled with bacon and cabbage. The last person in the group got the special, which was a NY strip roast. She asked for it medium rare, was told it might be closer to medium, to which she replied, \"nothing well done\". Wouldn't you know it, that piece of meat had no pink what so ever, she sent it back and we shared since we didn't want to wait for an entree to be cooked.   Desert was Creme Brulee and chocolate mousse. The Creme Brulee was huge and the sugar crust was perfect. The chocolate mousse was good, but served in a wine glass, so it was a pain to eat. I'm all for presentation, but functionality needs to be there too.  After seeing this guy on Iron Chef I was expecting a epic meal I would talk about for years to come. I guess I shouldn't have gotten my expectations up.",

Bacon candy was awesome,  Hamachi crudo was very good but should have been thinner,  ribbon pasta with sausage... pasta way too thick for home made,  but the sausage and broth outstanding.  Fish special on Monday night... I  know better.  It was Saturday's fish. Would definitely go back for something else and just stiff arm the numerous people who felt the need to approach our table every 2.5 minutes.",

Whenever I go to Tarbell's I cannot help but remember the time I ordered an Australian Shiraz.  I think the food server got confused when he heard me remark to my companion that the Penfolds Grange was one of my all time favorite wines.  By mistake he brought the Grange, which was selling for $450 a bottle. After I told him he brought the wrong bottle, he started to walk back to the wine cellar and dropped the bottle of Grange, which shattered, spilling all that great shiraz over the restaurant's floor.  I hope he did not have to pay for his accident.",

Recently we were in Phoenix for short getaway and made it for dinner. The corn bisque was fantastic and the rest of the meal was just as good. We tried two different desserts. I ordered the bread pudding and my wife had a cheesecake. The whiskey sauce on the bread pudding really had a whiskey taste to it which was a bit overpowering for my wife's taste. Her cheesecake was very tasty.",

    "text": "UPDATED IN AUGUST  Excellent. About everything you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.  I have to start with a long-ish story that tells a lot about the place:  When we were sitting at the bar, Shaq walked in and went to the VIP private room. (Tarbell knows how to show off his VIPs--the private room has a glass door looking out to the other tables.) Anyway, Shaq's publicist (I assume) was sitting next to me and my wife at the bar and was in a rather heated discussion with the restaurant manager. She wanted appetizers served right away to Shaq and the other guests (who were already seated in the private room,) so that he could get on with whatever other celebrity things he had to do that night. The manager refused, saying he didn't want to interfere with the flow of the meal by serving courses rushed or out of order. To me, refusing to cater to a celebrity to maintain the integrity of the meal is the sign of a truly great restaurant.  Anyway, onto the meal. First off, a first-rate mojito at the bar. I mean REALLY good. Ambiance is very modern and upscale, dangerously close to \"see and be seen\" but not quite going over.  The food really was spectacular. A hand-pulled mozzarella dish (basically a caprese) with unbelievably fresh, rich cheese, sweet and fresh basil and tomato that was better than farmer's market heirlooms. Even the micro-greens on the side were nutty, fresh and delicious, without any of the bitterness you often get with sprouts.  My wife had a fennel and orange soup. Not ingredients you normally think of putting together and I was hesitant to even try it, but it was spectacular! Fresh, light and wonderfully blended, subtle flavors. I enjoyed a cioppino that was surprisingly delicate and loaded with tasty seafood.  My Cast Iron Pepper Steak was slightly disappointing. It had an overwhelming amount of pepper on it--really a pepper crust. This was easily remedied with a little scraping, so it wasn't too bad. The accompanying pan-creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes were incredibly rich and amazingly good. I actually enjoyed the sides more than the steak itself. My wife had a perfectly cooked Yellowfin tuna steak that was rich and wonderfully flavored on its own but the soy- mirin broth was somewhat overpowering for the delicate fish.  We shared a marscapone cheesecake for dessert that my wife said was the best she's ever had. It had an unusual rosemary-caramel sauce that really put it over the top. Just an amazing sauce.  Overall a fantastic dining experience. Michael made the rounds to all the tables (not something you see as often anymore,) the atmosphere was comfortable and casual and even though they were very busy the staff was attentive and smoothly presented an excellent meal. A truly wonderful dining experience.",

What a great all around meal.  The food, service, atmosphere, everything was just top-notch.  Sweet Pea started out with the field greens, which he liked, but I had the kale salad which was excellent.  I'm a kale fan, but I've never really eaten it raw.  I'm a convert now, because I loved the salad and ate every bite.  We then had the scotch beef (him) and vegetable plate (me) with a side of the chickpeas.  The ingredients tasted so fresh, and the olive oil with the bread was really spectacular.  I've never tasted olive oil so fruity and delicious, even in Spain.  We would normally have enjoyed their extensive wine list, but we were in the mood for cocktails on that particular night, so we ordered mojitos.  My were they delightful!  Just the right balance of tangy and sweet- we both hate our mojitos too sweet.  Finally, we finished off the meal by splitting the strawberry shortcake.  Again, fresh and delicious.  We will definitely be going back.",

Service was good but not great, the server was unable to answer questions about the wine selections but did offer a suggestion from a winery a friend of his runs in Oregon.

Tarbell's uses locally grown organic produce & I like the statement on their menu \"Eat well and often\" -- my sentiments exactly.  Hmm, previous poster found menu uninspired or food bland.  Me, not so much.  I loved the \"organic field greens with wood oven-roasted apples,...goat cheese and golden beets\" for a starter.  I opted to go with a fairly traditional entree of butternut squash ravioli with roasted chestnuts, spinach and brown butter and it was exquisite.  Three of us shared entrees, actually, so I also tasted a wonderful \"Scotch beef with buttermilk mashed and organic broccolini\" and \"barbecue chicken pizza with house-pulled mozzarella and grilled green onions\".  Other menu options included big eye tuna tartare with taro chips and ginger cucumber relish or cornmeal crusted calamari with salsa verde and whole grain mustard sauces for starters.  And a double-cut pork chop with butternut squash-thyme bread pudding...grilled Scottish salmon on a crispy potato cake with molasses lime glaze.. several pizzas...for entrees.  And our sublime dessert was a chocolate cake with house-made ice cream.  Sides included \"maple glazed carrots & cranberries\" and \"Mark's mom's mac & cheese\".  Something for everyone.  Excellent service (they also had a wonderful Reisling by the glass -- hard to come by), streamlined, upscale surroundings -- all in all, a terrific dining experience.  We'd go back tomorrow.",

I have chastised myself too often this past week for trying restaurants outside this heavenly real estate address ~ for fear there were other 'Tarbell-Like' dining spots equaling this....Wrong Answer.  Mark is such a cut above - his team is such a cut above - that it's one of those life experiences where you feel in the caring arms of greatness mixed with warmth, humility ~~ soothing aroma's, blissful cocktails, always a lovely desert to be had...I could go on and on -- when everything ticks ... it's so much more than the sum of it's parts!  You go in tired and haggard from the day...to a truly welcoming host/hostess -- you can be seated promptly at most any hour - though I wouldn't burden them on a Sat. nite impromptu drop in on purpose - I've done it for the sheer need to get my 'fix' when everything else seemed to be pointing south in the day.  Bless them to pieces....I get seated anyway.  I'm doted on.  I'm treated superbly.  The drinks and the food come out - always memory making dishes.  The best Margarita this side of Margaritaville - I mean fresh squeezed lime - is there any other way?  Harry is the best dang barkeep I've had the pleasure to converse with.  And Mark?  Well Mark is a culinary hero.  He's got a great team of professionals working for him and has got to be the best general manager/owner in the business.  Because he cares about things that matter.  People.  The earth.  Food.  Great respect just oozes out of Mark for the world around him & he wants you to enjoy it too.  I'm going to go there again tonight -- to help heal the wounds of pricey unsavory dining experiences endured this week.  I've eaten Tarbell's halibut, beet salad, mac n cheese, the daily vegetable plate, & in the past the flatbread (pizza), the cioppino, 3 scoops icecream with 3 sauces, and that's all I remember right now.  But truly if you are looking for a Boston feel neighborhood restaurant with exemplary food and decor and drinks and staff - this is it........  You CAN taste the love in the food.",

Everything tasted fresh and unlike many restaurants that use butternut squash Tarbell's let the squash shine through rather than ladening it with sugar or other sweeteners. The sauce was a perfect accompaniment and the cheese on top melded delightfully with the ravioli and cream sauce. The sage leaf on top was a wonderful touch as well.  We asked the waiter to suggest a glass of wine and the wine he suggested went very well with the dish and was very enjoyable.  For dessert we had the chocolate cake which was very rich and wonderfully delicious. The ice cream on top helped cut through the richness a bit - finishing it felt guilty. The waiter was great. Overall it was a wonderful dinner. I would definitely go back on a special occasion.",
