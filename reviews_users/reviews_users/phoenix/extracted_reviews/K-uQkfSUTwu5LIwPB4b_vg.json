At first I thought the pork taco serving was small for two people but once you add it to the small corn tortillas and other toppings its plenty. Service was excellent we were seated outside under a heat lamp and someone came over and placed a cloth napkin on the ground where my purse was to protect it. Drinks were my only disappointment but since this is based on personal preference I still gave 5 stars. The mojito mint was not muddled and the wine selections were limited. I tried three different drinks and none really wowed me but the food more than made up for it.",

This timing changed by 30 min which lead to a very rushed and un satisfying experience  We felt rushed , we felt that there was an effort to upchage drinks and other parts of the meals  It was like eating at the end of the assembly line  While the manager acknowledged our unhappiness he did nothing to resolve the problem  When leaving he said come back and I will  buy  you dinner.  He will not have to worry about this  Rushed ,dark ,cramped setting  with a confusing menu that left us totally unsatisfied",

I made a reservation earlier in the week for Wednesday night - so glad I did: the place was buzzing!   My romantic husband did all the ordering for me and hit everything on the head. The Colorado Lamb Ribs Adobada was so delish - I could have had another! For our entrees, my husband ordered the Creekstone Filet and Diver Scallops. The filet was a bit too red for my taste, but my husband loved it! The scallops were the best I've ever had - they simply melted in my mouth! The smoked banana pieces that were on the plate were pretty and all, but I did not like them (nor did the people at the next table who we let try them). And of course, the Mission Fries were a happy combination for both my husband and I. I took them home and even ate them cold the next day and they were still wonderfully tasty!   Our stomachs so full that we could not even order dessert (shouldn't have had the chips and salsa the waiter brought out twice). But, our new friends from the next table did give me a taste of the pumpkin bread pudding and it was exceptional! I will definitely save room for that next time.  By coincidence, our waiter ended up being the famous \"Sam\" and all previous reviews are right - he is simply great! He loved that my husband ordered for me, kept the food a secret, showed up at the right times, and was just all around a nice guy. The restaurant itself was lively and fun. The chandeliers and mirrors gave it a romantic touch and I also loved the tiled wall! Manager was on hand (not that there were any problems, just wanted to tell him I loved this place) and everyone seemed really happy to be working here!   We will definitely be back!",

I wouldn't recommend this place if you have someone with food sensitivities or allergies in your party.  They really did try to be accommodating, but they struggled getting the order right.  When the order did come out, it lacked taste completely.  I'm sure their regular menu made the regular way is amazing because the guacamole was one of the most amazing things that I have ever eaten.    Also, very pricey.  More expensive than I would have anticipated (even considering its location) and I did not feel like I got what I paid for overall.",

Beer battered fish with an array of spices cooked to perfection. Their guacamole is superb. Absolutely to die for. And coming from Southern California that says a lot. The pumpkin bread pudding was exquisite. It had a cinnamon butter type of sauce and it made my taste buds fall in love.   Service: Our Servers were great! Wonderful happy peopled that really seemed to enjoy there job. Bartenders as well were super nice. Everyone was very hospitable and made our group feel very welcomed.   Atmosphere: This restaurant is gorgeous! Old mission style on the outside, modern, fancy art decor inside with subtle mission feel inside as well. The patio outside was beautiful! We had a fan that kept all of us cool and was not too loud.   Everyone in our group of six had a blast and I will recommend this place to everyone who visits Scottsdale.",

We didn't want to wait 30 minutes for a table inside so we sat on the patio.  It was hot as heck outside but they had an AC unit out there and it actually wasn't bad at all.  We didn't order any drinks but I am for sure next time.  I have to try one of their margaritas.    Here is a rundown of the eats:  *Chips = fresh and perfectly salted  *Salsa = just eh - it had almost no spice and tasted too tomato pasty for me  *Guacamole = phenomenal - they make it table side and you can make it exactly how you like it which in my case was with all the fixins' and spicy - it was awesome, just awesome  * Poblano Grits = creamy and delicious  * Street Corn = o-m-g - this was my favorite.  I could probably eat buckets of the stuff.  The sauce stuff they put on it is just amazing creamy spicy goodness.  Probably not too healthy though but it doesn't matter because it was fantastic.  * Tacos (I tried the chicken, steak and squash) = very very good.  The only problem is that they were tiny.  They are literally 2 inches in diameter and at over 4 bucks a pop (you get 3) it kind of pissed me off.  I know it is more than enough food but it still angered me.  Anyway, each one I had was excellent.  The meat was perfectly flavored and juicy and all the ingredients on the taco worked well together.  I also loved our waiter.  He was very friendly, funny and engaging.  He was so passionate about the place and its food it was almost as if he was the owner or had a stake in the place.  Enough said.  I cannot wait to return.  I'm still pissed about the size and price of those tacos though.",

    "text": "First time at The Mission (since my girlfriend an I are from out of town). Although we've certainly been to less enjoyable places to eat, we nonetheless won't be returning to this place.  Let's start with the pros: Nice ambience, great decor, friendly (and good looking) staff. The Chipotle Grits we had we're pretty tasty.  Now for the cons: way over priced in all regards. It seems they're big fans of the $14 price point. That's what it costs for all their signature margaritas which are small in size and low on alcohol (I drank two and didn't even feel a buzz - although they were tasty). The table-made guacamole is also $14, and it was average at best and small in quantity. My girlfriend and I both agreed we've had much better for much less $$$ at practically every other restaurant which serves guac (including at home). The Mahi Mahi tacos we ordered we're also $14, and tiny as could be. Like three little corn tortilla saucers on the plate with hardly anything on top. The fish was fried and the whole dish was ... average.  So there you have it. Our take on The Mission as experienced by a couple of Kansas Citians.",

Tableside guacamole and salsa was ridiculous, my favorite salsa ever..i ate a chip off of the ground it was so good.  I had the chorizo porchetta, which was honestly the best damn thing I have ever eaten. I imagine it is the gustatory equivalent of watching Jesus do the Carlton. Seriously.

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  You're not coming here for traditional Mexican food.  If you're looking for \"authenticity\" or \"regional cuisine,\" this isn't the place.  But if you're looking for good contemporary interpretations of Mexican food in a great setting, this is a good place to be.  We've only ever been here for brunch, but it is y far one of our favorite brunch places.  It usually starts with a Mission Mary - their interpretation of a bloody mary.  It is spicy, but more than spicy, it is also peppery, which adds a great new dimension to the drink.  Our go-to dish - the chilaquiles.  Red or green, doesn't matter, they are pretty tasty here.  Slight sourness in the green chiles, some decent heat in the red, the totopos aren't completely soaked through so there is some texture in the chips.  There is plenty of sauce to cover over the chips and get the flavor you're looking for, and juuuuuust enough meat to make the meal more substantial.    The house guacamole made tableside is also very, very good.  One of the best in the Valley.  It's got more stuff in it than your typical guacamole, but from the cotija cheese to the pepitas, they all add a little something.  Tried my wife's cinnamon pecan waffles.  Awesome.  Really good.  Not super sweet but really well balanced.  I've also tried the corn and crab pancake - these are perhaps the weakest brunch dish that we have tried.  Also had the regular steak tacos off the lunch menu and they too are tasty.  Not the best tacos ever, but still tasty.  This last trip, I tried their pig out all-you-can-eat pork bar where you have a choice between carnitas and pork confit tacos in a taco bar setting.  It's worth the money and it's pretty tasty, but not perfect.  The carnitas were a little dry.  The confit pork was definitely preferable and was better seasoned.  The salsa selection was also a little weak.  They have a little of everything (a tomatillo, a pico de gallo, etc.) but none of them tasted all that great.  I kept my condiments basic - onions and cilantro.  Street taco style.  The other slight weakness, the tortillas.  Small street-style corn tortillas, these were a little too thick to double up but too thin to hold up on its own.  The flavor of the masa was ok.  Would I order the all-you-can-eat again?  I think I would, but I'd really have to be in the mood and be pretty hungry.  So again.  Not traditional Mexican if you are a purist.  But still come for the good food.  It's worth the price.",

The first thing I noticed, no chips and salsa?  The waiter informed us that they are no longer providing complementary chips and salsa. WHAT?  Ok, we'll pay the $6 for chips and salsa. We all ordered the Mission Margarita. They are good margaritas, but not for the price. My wife and I shared the pork tacos for two. The flavor was great, but 1/3 of the meat was fat. My friend ordered the salmon. Again, great flavor, but small portion.  There are too many great Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale to pay top dollar for average Mexican Food. I'm not saying that I wouldn't come back, but I would think twice. A big bummer.",

Second, loved the concept of hand pressed tortillas, but they were way to greasy (easy fix). Finally, the guacamole was great....the salsa was too salty, and the lamb in the taco were under salted.

The food was ok but for the prices (at lunch 3 TINY shrimp tacos for $14) felt like a bit of a rip off.  The tableside guacamole was decent but not over the moon and the tacos that we ordered were nothing special.  I'm a bit of a foodie so I'm not speaking from inexperience, but I could have had tacos that tasted about as good or better for one quarter of the price.  I mean these tacos were REALLY small, barely enough for an appetizer, no less as the main course.  The service was good and the ambience was fine but for the prices they charge, save yourself a nice chunk of change and find a good local taqueria instead.",

Hungry and frustrated after 1 hour, I'm docking them 1 star.  Once we were seated, the food was great. The elote corn was really good, it was this sweet cream butter (tasted almost like caramel) on top of the cob, cut in half. The crispy pork with cola lime glaze was also really good- little pieces of juicy pork, sweet with a nice smear of this nutty paste inside a lettuce wrap. These were the 2 best dishes I would get again.  The guacamole was pretty standard, they put garlic, lemon, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and some cheese on top. They only use one avocado, for $12 I didn't think it was worth it. The mission fries were skinny fries served with two sauces- we couldn't finish this, but they were good fries and filling.  I'll probably come back for the food, but hope the front desk service improves or they start taking reservations.",

This wasn't just a \"mature eyes\" problem - there was a near-by tweenager using his cell phone flashlight to read his menu.  The place was also very loud making it difficult to converse.  Our waiter was good at adding extra dollars to our bill - we were asked if we wanted our margaritas with Grand Mariner not realizing that we would be paying for both a margarita and a shot of Grand Mariner, and when my dad was asked if he wanted tortillas with his entree we didn't realize that this was also an add-on.  It was very busy and our waiter was not very attentive to us.   The tableside guacamole wasn't - it was too crowded to fit the cart by our table although the result was tasty.  My father raved about his chorizo porchetta, and my mom and I were very happy with our diver scallops.  My husband's fish entree was also very tasty.  I'm glad we ordered a number of sides as the portions were quite small.  Overall, not the birthday dining experience that I had hoped for.",

The paps y chorizo was great too! They taste like home made french fries with slices of chorizo. For the main dish, I split the pork shoulder tacos with a friend! They place the tortilla chips on a giant salt block! The pork was so soft and tender and came with an amazing pineapple habanero glaze!!!! I also decided to try the aguacate(avocado margarita).

I guess we didn't realize they were street tacos and so, so, so tiny my manager even took a picture to send to a friend as a joke. The taste was fine, but I wish the waitress had warned us the portion size was so small.   I went back for brunch on a Sunday and had a much better experience. I had the Chorizo Scramble, which includes chipotle grits. I am in love with chipotle grits. They were incredibly creamy and flavorful. The portion size was very reasonable. There was a lot more food for $9 than the skirt steak tacos. I've been back for brunch and I really love it.   They have a great front patio as well as a back patio. During the winter months it's great to sit outdoors. Next time I go I'll have to sit inside and see what the vibe is like in there. The abuelita hot chocolate with dulce de leche whipped cream is also a winner.",

    "text": "We happened past The Mission as we were wandering around Old Town Scottsdale before today's Giants game (Giants won! Yes!). As we're vegetarians, and ballpark food is usually pretty sparse for folks who don't eat hot dogs and cheese steaks, we were looking for a place to grab some lunch before the game, and the menu here drew us right in.  We chose to sit on the well-shaded patio, as the interior of the restaurant is rather dark. The patio is really pleasant...well-shaded, and with plenty of cover to prevent...er...birdy accidents (I normally avoid dining al fresco, having lost many a tasty meal to a sparrow's incontinence, but this patio was sheltered enough that it seemed -- and, thankfully, was -- safe!).  Neither of us wanted anything heavy (we were still a bit full from a wonderful pizza at Papago Brewing the night before, and anticipating a big dinner at Cafe Lalibela in Tempe that evening). I ordered the Grilled Romaine Salad and an order of Grilled Street Corn, and my husband had the Roasted Organic Butternut Squash Tacos. We regretfully declined the tableside quacamole, even though we're major guac fans, as we knew we'd never find room for it (we did see it being made, though, and it looked amazing).  We both enjoyed our food, but we also agreed that my meal was the real star. If you've never tried (or thought about) grilling lettuce, you're really missing something! Grilling brings out the sweetness in this often rather bland vegetable, and adds a nice smokiness that was, in this salad, perfectly complemented by the chipotle vinaigrette. Everything was in perfect balance, with a slight saltiness added by the cotija cheese, a kiss of heat from the chipotles, and textural contrasts provided by the black beans and the thin tortilla strips. It was generously sized too...perfect for a light lunch.  The corn was, in a word, amazing. My serving consisted of nearly an entire ear of corn, served as two skewers, each bathed in a luscious chili-laced butter sauce and lightly coated with more cotija cheese. Yum!  My husband's tacos were very good as well. They were served as three mini-tacos, each on a small, handmade tortilla. The proportion of filling to tortilla made them something you'd want to eat with a fork (like a small, not-fried, tostada) rather than try to pick up. The filling was well-seasoned and had a very good flavor.  I also had one of their house margaritas (on the rocks), and it was very well-made. You knew you were drinking tequila and not some cheap-o candy drink. Good flavor, with just the right amount of tartness.  Very glad we stopped here! We'll be repeat customers!",

It's fun to make dinner into a tapas affair with a bunch for the table to share. Portions are small so the bill can get high quickly especially with drinks but it's a cozy and romantic ambiance. I love the fire outside on the patio and the banquette seating inside isn't too terrible either but for a truly special night I'd ask for a booth inside if you can't sit on the patio. I'm not sure how accommodating they are as I've never had any issues but it was a yummy dinner.   Service was attentive but invisible which is kind of nice sometimes!

The skirt steak tacos and flat iron steak were divine.  We both loved the Mission fries too.  Unfortunately we did not experience table side made guacamole, but judging by the 2 women moaning in ecstasy next to us, I'd say it's pretty fantastic!  Margaritas were delicious, and be sure to try the crispy pork cola appetizer.  Such unique flavors, you must try it.  Word to the wise, we're from Seattle and \"casual\" means t-shirts and jeans to us.  Needless to say, we were the only people in t-shirts and jeans on a Thursday evening.  I'd kick it up a notch if you can.",

You won't be disappointed.   3. Delicious take on Mexican food. It's a refreshing change from the norm.   4. The pork shoulder taco's for 2 are AMAZING. Get them. And at only $32.... not pricey at all (especially for two people)! The salmon is excellent as well.   5. The side dish of corn is delectable. Get that too.   6. Go for your birthday or anniversary and get their take on bread pudding, free. We're going tonight for a birthday and I can't wait to sink my teeth into the pumpkin bread pudding, YUM!  7. Service is excellent. Servers are knowledgable. Great decor. Romantic.",

I am a regular and here is why: -Amazing ambiance..... dark with lots of candles and a salt brick wall. Really cool music at just the right volume. -Creative, unique and perfectly executed menu. What makes this place so special is there is literally nothing like it in town. -Friendly service. In my experience, the servers had strong knowledge of the menu and were real people. At a lot of these nice restaurants service is great but seems a bit fake. People who work here seem comfortable in their own skin and are generally fun to talk to. -Top notch margaritas! I sat at the bar once and the bar manager Mike took great  care of us. I was pretty sure my girl friend was going to dump me for this guy...he is as smooth as it gets. This guy has to be melting hearts on the reg between his game and the tequila selection.  If you want to get in here I strongly recommend a reservation...pretty tough to get in even on week days without one.",

    "text": "What I Ate - chips and guacamole - grilled street corn - pork shoulder tacos (pineapple glaze and cilantro) - pumpkin bread pudding  Would I Go Again? Two items highlighted my experience at The Mission: chips and guac, and pumpkin bread pudding.  Chips and Guacamole To begin, they bring out a big rolling cart and make the guacamole right in front of your table.  I watched him open up the avocado and add pine nuts, cilantro, etc., and then he mashed it all together.  When I took my first bite, then I quickly realized I should have taken a video of making the guac.  It was amazing, and now I have no idea how to recreate it.  (I'm sure I couldn't anyway, but it's fun to think about.)  The all-important consistency was on point.  It was not chunky, but there were still enough chunks of avocado to remind you that the guac was homemade rather as opposed to the creamy, Cool Whip-like texture of guac from a mix.  The guac was awesome--the pine nuts, cilantro, and other juices and spices were perfect.  Pumpkin Bread I'm not a pumpkin bread connoisseur by any stretch, but I would confidently challenge any other restaurant's pumpkin bread pudding to hang with The Mission's.  The baked edges, caramel sauce, and ice crea made me yearn for more.  If only I hadn't filled up on the chips and guac!  Sometimes the toughest choices in life are between two good things, right?  The rest of the meal was just sub-par.  The Mission is supposedly famous for its pork shoulder tacos, but I thought they were bland and dry.  The grilled street corn was very good but I can't imagine ever getting too fired up about corn.    Simply put, I would highly recommend The Mission to anyone living or staying in the Scottsdale area, and I would especially recommend the chips and guac and pumpkin bread pudding.",

As soon as we sat down they shut the blinds and the restaurant went completely dark, they had a little candle on each tablet but they did nothing to help. I mentioned it to the waitress and she said that's the way it is and did absolutely nothing to help. We had to use the flashlight on our cell phone to read the menu and to see our food through the whole meal. We also noticed every other table of customers using their cellphone flashlight to see.

So if you don't mind rolling the dice for $75 - it's worth it when you win. When they are on their game - you are in for a treat!! But move on if you don't like the odds. Something has changed - would give this place 6 out of 5 stars if I could when I visited 3 months ago - but not today.  We made reservations on this visit but it took 3 tries before we could find a spot where we were not being blinded by broken shutters that let in a piercing shaft of light - or sandwiched into a spot much too tight to be seated. Obviously the host was new or trying to fill the \"ugly\" seats....and it started us off on the wrong foot.  In my previous visit I tried the grouper - and simply amazed at the contrasting heat with sweetness followed by the tenderness of the flakey grouper. I raved about it for weeks. That was 3 months ago and when I flew my team in - we made a beeline for The Mission. This was not the same meal - ok - but not the level I  enjoyed before. No heat, no sweetness - good grouper - but not excellent. My meal was a 2 and about the same quality to what I get at a beachside lunch joint.... certainly not worth the $245.00 we dropped for the 3 of us.  We were seated in seat #1 by the kitchen door - where we were created by wafts of propane gas as the door would swing open by staff passing in and out of the kitchen. The gas was so strong / pungent that at its strongest we seriously considered leaving for our safety - half expecting the old church to be blown to kingdom come.",

Would deduct 1/2 star if I could for the indoor tables being a little close together, and the lighting in the restaurant is rather low, even after your eyes adjust.   $30 for the marinated free-range chicken.  Pricey but really packed with flavor...grilled mushrooms, Oaxacan cheesy rice which was FABULOUS, chile verde and a black bean sauce.  Did not disappoint.  $14 for 3 short rib tacos on freshly made flour tortillas that are top-notch.  Very tender beef piled high with smoked cashews and topped with cotija.  GREAT combination of flavors.  The taco size is a tad small (think \"street\" size tacos) but they do pile on the ingredients so for someone who isn't overly hungry, the tacos are a reasonable option.  Service was incredibly fast for a Friday night at 6pm (we lingered after dinner and did not feel rushed to leave).",

Manager walked around on occasion to make sure all was well. Truly a great find in Scottsdale!",

This is dreamy rich, yummy guac with tasty toasted pepitas on top. The carnitas tacos are phenomenal! Cocktails were Don Draper approved. The patio is adorable. (I can't believe I just said that frumpy statement). Do yourself a favor and go.  I live a 1.5 hour flight away and I've been three times in a year. Need I say more?",

They served us warm chips and salsa for starters and we ordered table-side guacamole which was amazing.  For dinner, I ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly medium rare.   Comparing the quality of the food, atmosphere and price with similar restaurants in Los Angeles, this place is an awesome deal. I highly recommend this place. Our server was pretty fantastic and extremely personable, too.",

Started with fresh guacamole made tableside to your spice level liking along side homemade crispy tortilla chips. I decided on short - rib tacos after the waiter said somewhat jokingly  if I didn't like them then he'd pay for them. He knew he had nothing to worry about! There were 3 small taco shells on the plate heaped with short - rib meat perfectly cooked and seasoned. I ordered a side of street corn that was sweet and crunchy seasoned nicely. My wife and friend ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos battered that they both said were great. I'm making myself hungry writing this. Think we'll go back tomorrow.",

    "text": "This was my first time here, with a MeetUp lunch group of 8.  They were gonna seat us inside, which was really really dark and dingy, seems like you can't read the menu.  Today was such a beautiful day to sit in the back patio, where they had heaters, and shade and trees, so they kindly set us up a table in the back outdoors.  We so enjoyed it there.  The food was True to the reviews here, which was \"really expensive\", but really \"tasty\".  I am not sure I would return to pay so much for so little.  One Yelper said the tacos tortilla was only 3.75\" , I was laughing that he measured them, said tiny tortilla wasn't big enough to lift the filling to your mouth.   When I asked the waitress if they were indeed only 3.75\" in diameter, she said \"No, they are only 3 inches\".   I was amused, not sure if she was being facetious, but when they arrived, they looked 3 inches to ME.   3 tiny \"tacos\" for $10-$12 depending on filling, no garnishes to even eat, nothing else but those 3 tiny tacos.   We agonized for so long over spending $6 for chips and salsa (cos it is free at other restaurants), and how many ways we were going to split the $6, that the restaurant gave us 3 orders worth $18, gratis, to our table.    I ate pork shoulder tacos for $10.  It was really delicious!  Every bite of other people's orders was delicious too, but when we shared a bite, we were giving away a substantial portion of our lunch, because the portions were so tiny.  The lunch menu was pretty limited in choices.  I did not see the dinner menu.    This day was our server's second day working here, but she did a great job, and was good at pouring us water, after all one particular hot sauce used to make the guacomole, if you wanted it extra hot, was making one person's face all read and teary.    I was hungry when I got home, and ate another lunch from my fridge.",

About 10 minutes goes by and he returns; we tell him someone else took our order, which never came. She comes back and totally forgot what our order even was. So he comes back and gets it and will be taking our table. Total confusion.

That's probably the reason why you're paying $12 for 3 tacos. Personally I'd rather eat $1-2 dollar tacos that have more robust flavors rather than a good looking plate. If you ever visit Chicago, go to LA Haciendita (47th and archer, 51st and kedzie, or 59th and Pulaski). Might not look as nice or fancy but the food makes this place look weak.",

We had reservations at 6:30 and got there right on time. but when we went up to the hostesses were very confused and told us to wait. We waited about ten minutes before a gentleman came up to us and asked us if we had been helped. We explained the situation and he said \"ok\" and left. We waited another 10 minutes before the hostess took us to our table.   We had the absolute WORST table but because we had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation time we didn't complain. We were seated at a very small table (it barely fit our dinner plates) right behind the hostess stand. We were constantly being bumped into by the hostesses and had to watch them \"wash\" the menus with a disgusting rag. We were also bumped into by the people walking by. In addition, we were so close to the table next to us, we actually ended up talking to those people the whole time because it was basically like we were at the same table.   We ordered the pork shoulder tacos to share and they were delicious (hence the 3 star review). It was a perfect amount of food for the two of us and tasted delicious. We ordered a side of beans, which were also good. The beans were pretty pricey so we probably wouldn't recommend them.   The service was ok. She did her job by taking our order and bringing us the bill. Not much more. It may have been because she couldn't really get to us because of the seating situation.    We liked the food but we won't be returning any time soon. Not worth it.",

    "text": "Rather disappointed overall with The Mission.  From the moment I walked in, I knew I was probably in the wrong spot.  I was visiting from out of town, and just wanted some good Mexican food.  I'm a foodie, I don't need a lot of ambiance.  In fact, give me a wood floor, a wobbly table and someone that just knows how to cook great, and I'm set.  This place was very nice, very popular, but I don't view Mexican to be like this.  Not racist, but again, I wanted simple, great, authentic food, cooked the way one would cook in their own kitchen.  I had the Mahi Mahi tacos.... and I got three tacos, each looked to be maybe 3\" in diameter, a bit larger than a silver dollar.  That's it.  No rice, no beans, three SMALL tacos for about $15.  I also had the made tableside guac... and while it was EXCELLENT, it was also $14!  I'll say this, it was delicious and the guy making it was really nice, great guy!!  The service... if it wasn't for the guy making my guac, who also kept my water coming, I would have said it was terrible service.  My waitress just seemed overworked, and as a result, the service was not good!  Really disappointed there, especially when I paid so much for so little.    Overall, TERRIBLE value for the money, one of the worst overall experiences I've had in a while.  If it wasn't for the guac and the guy making it, this would have had ONE start from me!",

    "text": "The more I think about it, the more enthusiastic I become about The Mission. We had lunch there yesterday since I wanted to try someplace new and I'd read good reviews. It's \"new Latin\" cuisine, brought to you by the people behind the successful Zinc Bistro, Matt Carter and Terri Ellisor.       The setting is lovely. It's housed in one of the outbuildings of the blindingly white old Mission Church in Old Town Scottsdale. You walk through an attractive fireplace'd patio and into the aroma of fire- grilled meats and romantic darkness (even at lunch). Unfortunately, you're assaulted by the background music which was very loud and distracting.  There's an interesting back-lit wall of orange and beige Himalayan salt blocks (actually I thought they were fake bricks until I read differently - gauche me). Lots of fancy chandeliers hang from the black ceiling, casting only a little light on the faux finished ochre walls and the somewhat crowded dark topped tables. Our server, Derek, added to the ambience - he was attractove, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Many of our south-of-the-border neighbors are represented on it: Mexico of course, Ecuador, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Uruguay, Cuba,and probably some I've missed.        I ordered a Cubano torta, one of my favorite grilled sandwiches with pork belly, smoked ham, swiss cheese, pickle, dijon and yucca ($12). The pork belly was meltingly tender.  Surprisingly, the torta did not come with a side, which struck me as pretty chintzy for the $12 price, but that was okay because I had to try the Creamy Grits ($8). Ken chose the Pabellon Arepas ($12). An arepa is a cross between a pancake and an english muffin. It's made out of a special pre-cooked corn meal, water and a little salt. First it's fried on a griddle, then it can be baked in the oven for a while where it rises a little and becomes less dense. It's then split, sometimes some of the interior is scooped out, and then it's filled with whatever delicacy strikes your fancy. In this case the arepa contained braised beef, peppers, black beans, cotija cheese, and fried plantains. So good. I spent an hour today googling arepas recipes and plan to go in search of the special corn meal tomorrow. The only disappointing (actually downright bad) thing on Ken's plate were the french fries, a mixture of white and sweet potatoes. They were supposed to have been sprinkled with lime and cumin, but they weren't, and also they were sadly limp. But OMG, the grits!!!! These were made with the addition of chipotle powder, butter, honey, and cotija cheese. They were on the spicy side, but the heat was moderated by the honey. The color was kind of a cross between pink and salmon (at least that's how it looked in the dim light), which made it even more interesting to eat. $8 for a good sized bowl which I proceeded to eat pretty much by myself as the grits were too spicy for everybody else (this was fortunate, because I really don't know if I would have been able to bring myself to share).       Our friend Ernest had a Skewered Grill Prawn Salad ($14), with arugula, yuzu vinaigrette, avocado, potato and orange sections. He said the prawns were nicely cooked but were somewhat too spicy for his taste. Anna ordered a chicken arepa ($12) with chorizo, corn, aji amarillo (the menu doesn't tell you, but this is a hot yellow chili pepper from South America - be warned), and Oaxaca cheese. While she didn't complain, I have the feeling she would have been happier without the pepper. The food here really isn't for the faint of heart (or heat). I don't know if the kitchen would be able or willing to tone it down for you, but it's worth asking.          But the desserts won everybody over. We tried the Pumpkin Bread Pudding ($6), which is composed of pumpkin bread, creme brulee, a butterscotch sauce loaded with Scotch, pepitas, and topped with Berto's cinnamon gelato. To die for, not to mention get drunk on. The Fried Bananas ($7) were terrific, too, served with butter, nutmeg, peanuts, and a dollop of peanut butter mousse.       Go on line to see the dinner menu. It's expensive, most of the entrees are in the $20+ range, but they sound fabulous. The Mission is, for me, one of the most exciting restaurants I've been to in a long time, and I'm grateful for it. But especially for the grits!",

    "text": "We have been meaning to try The Mission for awhile, and we were extremely impressed. We are self-professed foodies, good cooks, etc. Let's start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time, and that reservation had only been made that day.....surprising, because the place was packed!! Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them. Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into. OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as \"worth it\" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly. Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed. Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner. I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine....some citrus sorbet, chocolate-with-red-chile cake, lime cheesecake. At any rate, I still give them the full Monty on stars!!! Most recent visit: the food was just as great, but we weren't as blown away by the ambiance. We were seated at a table for two on the back wall. My elbow literally kept bumping the gentleman to my left and the conversation to the right of us (a party of four) was literally so close that it inhibited us from having much conversation of our own. Also, the restaurant is SOOO dark you would think they would notice when FOUR neighboring tables are all using their cell phones/flashlight apps to read the menu.",

The patio was comfy and cozy and we started off with the obligatory adult beverages (Red Sangria, The Missionary, Modelo, and Smokehouse Marg).  I heart sangria and this came close to my favorite Valley sangria (Ticoz).  It was delicious.  Next, we opted for the tableside guac, which was devoured in minutes.  Our server was attentive, friendly, and funny.  She took great care of us.  The entrees were delicious and offered options that you don't get around the Valley.  I look forward to going back to try the items that were not on the Restaurant Week menu!",

I had the pork shoulder tacos and my husband had the skirt steak tacos. Both had really great flavor and texture. We also had the street corn... The best corn, I've ever had! The buttery cotija cheese sauce drizzled over the corn was spicy and really added a unique flavor that was delicious. The service was prompt and friendly, too. We sat at the bar and had a great time. We will definitely go back! Give it a try... It's worth it!",

They've created a lovely environment. The owner is very nice, staff was as well but I have to say that the Chef is clearly trying too hard with the menu. The dishes are over thought and pretentious. I think that the food should be uncomplicated. I'm not suggesting they do standard Mexican fare, rather that they keep a dish's integrity. They put things toghether on a plate that do not make sense to the palate. I think they need to do the regional foods of Mexico and elevate those dishes instead of doing a \"Latin inspired\"  menu with no cohesion. Having said that, I found that the sides were the stars of the menu... the popcorn grits were out of this world , as was the guacamole.  Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant, however I would caution one to pay attention to ingredients and stick with simpler dishes.",

Lauren was our server and she was the most knowledgable server I've ever had. She was also very attentive without being annoying.  We ordered drinks - all of the margaritas were excellent - and the table-side guacamole (a must!). Rueben came to our table and some of us wanted spicy and some didn't. So he split it in half. He even topped it with pumpkin seeds. I asked him if he was sure they weren't nuts because I have an allergy, he actually made me a small portion with nothing on it (so sweet!) We ordered and shared the braised short ribs and they were the best I've ever had! So moist they just fell off of the bone. The steak tacos were so flavorful. I wish I could describe the flavor - it's smokey and just excellent!  They even brought us the pumpkin bread pudding at no charge (although I cannot guarantee they will do this for anyone else!) and it was amazing!  Over all, our experience was one of the best we've ever had. If you go to Scottsdale, you HAVE to go to The Mission - you won't regret it!",

It was great to spend time with my good friend but I can't imagine anyone thinking this restaurant was worthy of 5 stars. It was very overpriced for a few average tacos! I will say that I loved the guacamole but wouldn't have dined there just for that. The Barrio Cafe also has fabulous table side guacamole. We split a bottle of wine and a salad to start. The salad was supposed to have cantaloupe in it. We were half way through when we realized we were missing melon. We had a very dismissive server named Sam who insisted there was cantaloupe in it but didn't know if it was diced or in the garnish sauce. We asked him to check and he seemed put out. Returned and claimed we should have been able to see it. He asked what we wanted to do about it. Should he bring more..we agreed that he could bring 1/2 a salad...which he did with tons of cantaloupe on it..and then he stopped by to make sure we found the cantaloupe! He disappeared after that and we never saw him again until he brought the bill. The menu is very limited at lunch. If you aren't into tacos or tortas don't bother! Our server was unpleasant..the tacos that followed the salad ok but not as good as some local family run spots. The best part of the afternoon was the company of a good friend who made the experience fun despite the lackluster, over priced food!",

It was crisp with a little bite to it - perfect!   I sipped my drink while I enjoyed the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos, which were incredible. The meat was flavorful and tender; the spices perfect. The portion size was a little small - the corn tortillas were silver-dollar size - which perhaps explains how the Primarita went straight to my head?  I highly recommend this place.

Ends up, there was a party of 50 in the back and rather than explaining this, our waiter just ignored us for the hour. I'm not sure if we were supposed to get chips and salsa, but every table seemed to have been served them and I didn't see it on the menu.  The waiter convinced me to order his favorite dish, the chorizo porchetta and I didn't love it - it was okay. It definitely needed the tortillas that I later ordered to go with. The chicken tacos my husband ordered were great, but more of an appetizer size.  The real kicker was that our waiter PROFUSELY apologized to the table next to us for the long wait (they arrived after us, however) and brought a dessert on the house to their table. What did we get? The check. So rude!! We hardly left a tip, the service was that poor.",

    "text": "As it would happen, choosing The Mission as a place to pre-game the evening's events was the best decision my crew made all night. (For my sake's anyway).  There was the ambiance.... The ambiance here envelopes you, much like that first wave of warmth you get from a vicodin, scotch and Red Bull blast. In fact, this place is so warm and cozy, it'll make you feel like you're back in the womb flipping off the ultrasound technician.  The service... Perched at their communal high top, a long and double-sided table adjacent to the bar, our server was more attentive than a lion tamer with a big stick. This made it an absolute certainty I would lose the first of my five senses in a very short period...hearing. The weird thing about those communal tables is how you never know who you're going   to sit next to. Who do I get? A gaggle of what I can only conjecture were church ladies whom, at my merely uttering (90 decibels) the word 'FUCK', would violently, and in unison, snap their heads in my direction. Now this was fun. Yes, my prodigious cursing made for quite the theatrics as, with the same precision of Old Faithful, five heads would whip about on cue giving me the skunk-eye. What a hoot.  The Food.... The food was, well, I'm not sure. It looked and smelled good, but I was down to three senses by the time we finally ordered. Sadly, taste, much like Elvis, had left the building at that point. Good thing for our dates who were quick to inform us (routinely droning on throughout the meal) about how delicious everything was. (Blah Blah Blah)  The bill for four of us came to two hundred twelve dollars before tip. We had drinks, some very cool looking appetizers, enough chips and salsa to feed a small Ethiopian village, a bevy of drink, and some entrees whose names I couldn't remember if my life depended on it.  As I said, pre-gaming at the Mission was the best decision we made all night.  Who could ever know that with one well-timed (and perhaps highly audible) \"FUCK\", I held the awesome power to control my very own Women's Synchronized Scowling Team. For at least one night of my miserable existence, I WAS omnipotent.  Thanks Mission.",

It was a packed scene at 7pm tho it quoted down a bit by 8:30. Service was excellent despite the heavy crowd and they seemed to have a choreographed dance down moving through the restaurant in and out of the kitchen. Our waiter was knowledgeable and steered us through the rather full menu choices. The table side guac was fun, and the pork belly app was creative. The mahi tacos were a bit heavy with the breading. And overall decor was very well done. Would go back if we're ever back in Scottsdale.",

We split the brisket torta and the Kobe beef hot dog. The torta was good, little lighter than expected, very bright favors. The dog was good, par for the course, probably wouldn't order it again though. Service was great, friendly and timely.   The only bad experience we had here was that when we checked in with the hostess she said it would be a 30-40 minute wait. This seemed odd as there were quite a lot of open tables. We decided to log on to Open Table and booked a reservation immediately. Checked back in with the hostess after making the Open Table reservation and were seated immediately. Kind of ridiculous in my book, but we got over it once we had a drink and some guac.",

I was dining alone, but the patio with the fireplace was a nice quiet place to hang out, read a book on my Kindle, and have some tasty food. The prices were a bit crazy. I'm used to excellent restaurants that have talented chefs, but I thought the prices were a bit much. I ordered a Margarita. It was $14. I expected more than 2 oz. of Margarita in an 8 oz. glass FULL OF ICE. It was an OK Margarita, but not worth $14. Chicken soup was very tasty, and the Chipotle Caesar had interesting flavors.   So, apart from the ridiculously overpriced drink, I think it's a perfectly nice place to eat. Be prepared to spend about $50 per person (minimum). Unless you just have an entree and a glass of water.",

My family can be a handful and we wanted for very little during our meal.  The guacamole is awesome and made right at the table; although, we asked for hot and we felt it could have used a little more heat.    While we had several different dishes, I would highly, highly, highly recommend the duck.  Another table favorite was the pork tacos with the pineapple glaze.  My aunt is quite sensitive to spice and so we asked for ALL of the glaze on the side and it was perfect and very mild.  For dessert, we had a pumpkin bread pudding and while bread pudding is not my favorite (at all) - this one was exceptional.  I will definitely be back! Yum!",

    "text": "Just had a yummy meal at The Mission. The atmosphere is beautiful--candles, chandeliers, and mirrors everywhere--along with tall, attractive patrons. I felt very short as I was waiting for my table with a bunch of other people. It was quite busy (Saturday night), and even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait 20 minutes. But, once we sat down and got drinks--a Smokey margarita and a pear and basil margarita--I immediately felt more content. Both margaritas were good. The pear one was perhaps a little too sweet to go with dinner but would be great as a happy hour drink.  The food was good, and we ordered way too much. We had: tableside guac with chips and salsa, delicious Peruvian stew, a chicken dish and black halibut (usually black cod). My chicken dish was humongous, which caught me off guard. I could barely finish it, but I can't wait to eat the leftovers. The sauce on the roasted chicken was spicy and delicious. It came with mission fries, which are a mixture of sweet potato and regular fries spiced with cumin and lime.  The service was friendly and prompt but not rushed. I appreciated that they let us take our time even though the place was packed. I asked the waitress to bring a special dessert for my bf's birthday, and they brought out their signature dessert, the pumpkin bread pudding, along with two lit sparklers that sat upright in a lime. The dessert was full of caramel goodness, and I just \"had\" to break my dessert fast to have a few bites.  This place is pricey, but for a special occasion, it's just the place for a fun time.",

Fast forward to today.  I was headed somewhere else, but they were closed for the Labor day holiday.  There were cars parked in front of The Mission (as there generally are) so I decided that perhaps I had been hasty in my original opinion.  Perhaps it was because I arrived after 3:00 when they only serve a limited menu, but I tried the brisket sandwich.  The experience didn't start off bad...it was kind of flavorful and interesting, until I realized that what I was chewing on was mostly fat.  The $12 sandwich was mostly not brisket (coleslaw and such), and the brisket that it contained was very fatty meat.  The second half of the sandwich was so greasy that I passed on the saturated bread and picked through the contents...coleslaw and fat.  No third chance for this restaurant.",

This is definitely a place to take that certain someone you're trying to impress.   After gorging myself on fresh, hot chips, salsa and table side guac, I was amazed I had room for anything else. The only thing I personally didn't adore was the corn. I wanted it a little more grilled and a little less sauced. Maybe I am just not a fan of the cheese/corn combo, but when the tacos hit the table, I was magically hungry again. The corn tortillas were hot and soft, just as they should be. Every taco was easy on the taste buds, but I think my favorite was the fish-- delish! The milkshake and mini-churro finished the meal with sweet success.

Pork Shoulder (serves two) $32.00 - Amazing and not just because it's pork! The presentation of the tortillas was pleasant and the portion was more than enough for two, although we had to ask for seconds on the tortillas to finish off the great pork meat.  Drinks: Strawberry & Cinnamon Margarita - Good & Strong for a light weight like myself  My husband had some sort of Don Julio something or other.  The dessert was strange, Espresso Churros + milkshake $8.00. Wasn't a fan of the dessert but the meal overall was great.

Both were really good but I prefer the classic. The Guac was different but really good. It was chunky and spicy, just how I like it. Next we went with the flat iron and steak tacos. Again, both were really good. The homemade tortillas were really fresh and tasty. The flat iron was med rare which is what I normally like but think we should have went with med. the steak tacos were the highlight. They were bite-size but full of steak. A nice SW flavor-Yum!  The desserts looked amazing but we were too stuffed to partake. Definitely worth a visit. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Short Version: French-Mexican. Same guys from Zinc Bistro. Hip and trendy if not a little too \"hoity-toity\" depending on the people working. Get the Pork Shoulder Tacos and start with the Guacamole. On the expensive side for Mexican food, but it's worth it and more than just typical.  Long Version: This place is always a safe bet and it's one of my go-to places when people ask me for recommendations. This is how you make Mexican food unique. The food served always exudes freshness and unique culinary expertise. The must-have for us are the Pork Shoulder Tacos which are perfectly tender and juicy, The Tableside Guacamole which has the perfect kick and zest, and the White Bean Puree which has the perfect texture and flavor.  Now on to the service. We've been here probably 12 times total and always had great service but the last time I went, the service left something to be desired. I came with one of my best friends who is well connected in the restaurant scene and if it wasn't for him, we would've left. We got there on a Sunday night off-peak time with visible empty tables and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. I understand this can happen when they're holding tables for reservations, but one hostess in particular was very smug and snooty about the whole thing. Just as we decided we'd go somewhere else, my buddy saw his friend working and talked to him about getting us in. He happily obliged and got us a table within 10 minutes and continued to take very good care of us throughout the night. Perhaps this is a normal rule in the restaurant OR the hostess was just upset we bypassed her smug attitude and got in anyways, but when I asked her for an extra menu she curtly told me that she didn't have any and told me I have to take my hat off. So, just a bit of warning, even though we're in Arizona where flip flops are pretty much excepted everywhere, don't wear a hat to this restaurant even though it's also a Mexican restaurant, but it IS a higher-end one so there's that.   Also, don't ask that hostess for a menu. She's incapable of keeping track of the one thing she's responsible for; menus. Good to have friends with connections though!",

We got to sit down very quickly.  I think it is great that they take reservations for a party of any size!  Not really all that common these days.  We started with the quacamole and it was excellent!  I also had the primarita, which was made with fresh squeezed limes and agave necter.  Delicious and low cal :)  We, also had the cripsy pork, and halibut as suggested by our server.   Everything was amazing!  Overall, our experience was great!

    "text": "So thankful we changed our original dinner reservations to try The Mission instead...such a GREAT find! We started off our meal with tableside guacamole (all the reviews had me sold!) It was everything I imagined and more. There were large chunks of avocadoes in the dip and the pepitas on top were a wonderful extra crunch! For dinner, I ordered the butternut squash tacos. Our waitress informed me that they were small so I also ordered a side of the white bean puree. My husband ordered the pork shoulder with corn tortillas. I absolutely loved my tacos and hated to take the final bite! Surprisingly, I didn't even miss the meat... the beans, squash, and avocado was a delicious combination. I also added a little of my white bean puree to the tacos and it was a tasty addition. I then finished off the dip with our leftover tortilla chips. There was no way I was leaving any of it behind! My husband loved his pork shoulder--our waitress said it was the chef's favorite dish to make and he did a fabulous job with it! The pork easily came apart with a fork, and with the sauces, he had five very flavorful mini tacos. His plate was also empty by the end of the night!",

We had some tacos and guacamole that were expensive and really mediocre.  Drinks were fine but nothing great.  We sat in the courtyard patio area and busboys and waiters hovered annoyingly over our table for the duration of the evening.  It took ten minutes for us to be seated even though we had reservations and the restaurant was half empty.  I don't understand the appeal here at all.

I said, I received a confirmation call, but no one said anything about our seating arrangements. They said to give them a minute, and they did end up seating us inside.  It wasn't a big deal from what I could tell, but they made it their drama. Ok, so the real review... Yes, Yes, YES! The pozole soup was delicious. My husband had the duck empanada, which was too big to be an appetizer - tasty, but too much food. My meal was scallops perfectly prepared and pleasingly presented. My husband had the pork shoulder - tender and well seasoned. The white bean puree that came with the pork was really a treat.  We were too full for dessert, but the mojitos during our meal made up for the absence. Our waitress helped make our mea fun and pleasant - she knew the menu, could answer our questions and made good suggestions.",

Apparently, however, our server was the most appetizing element of the entire evening, because that's all they talked about.   I'll admit, even I took a second glance at the clean-shaven stud that took especially careful care of the ladies... and gents, in our group. Dude delivered the goods in style. But, gee, I must've been the only one who was thinking about the meat inside the folds of those tacos after we left. Seriously flavorful delights, folks. Dine on the swine, for sure, it simply knocks the other land-based meats, chicken and steak, out of the water. This goes for the domestic style corn wraps and the crunchy lettuce wraps, equally. Artistically rendered and inspired plates abound at the Mission. And I'll drop a big thumbs up for the kale salad, I thought it was fabulous; this admission surely wins me Metrosexual points, yes?   Finally, the drinks. As a general rule, the further you wander from the familiar path, here, the better. While everyone was quite comforted by the house specialty margarita (and it was tasty), I found much more complexity and delight in the unusual options on the menu. Top it all off with a sitting on the lovely patio, and your Mission, should you choose to accept it, is impeccable.",

    "text": "Uhm.  Okay. So. Let's just start by mentioning I came here TWICE in one week. It was THAT good.  Our favorites?  The ambience (we sat at the bar) The food (holy amazeballs) The drinks (jalapeno Margarita was WOW)  The bartender (mike? He's AWESOME and would be good at anything but MADE my experience that much better).   Favorite foods?  Duck carnitas empanada Pork belly iceberg lettuce tacos Steak tacos Toreados Mike (lol) really though HE MAKES THE EXPERIENCE.   The food was Sooooo good.  Get there early because kitchen closes at 10.  It gets crowded for dinner but I do recommend sitting at the bar.  Please don't be afraid- skip the chicken and go for pork and duck... be adventurous!  And if you like spice, make sure you ask for their spicy sauce. It'll knock your socks off!   Now go enjoy! And say hi to Mike for us!",

Everything we ate and drank was amazing but the spice level is definitely up a notch! We got the skinny margaritas and they were so delicious and limey and not overly sweet! Absolute perfection. For apps we got the table side guacamole (small portion in my opinion) and the crispy pork belly lettuce wraps. Both were amazing. For mains I got the filet that came with poblano grits and then I got a side of corn. The grits were delicious but I think there could have been more on the plate considering the amount of meat on the plate. The steak itself was nothing to write home about but it was cooked to the right temperature. There was also random Cojita cheese sprinkled to the side of my plate which I found slightly out place. Other Than that it was an amazing meal!",

I am in the restaurant business and after waiting an hour to have our orders taken and then when they finally came to the table two hours after being seated, they had meat on them. As a vegetarian, it was obvious there was an issue but the server came over and gave more attitude than graciousness. At which point, the manager came over, acting as though he had no idea what was going on and when we told him about the issue, he laughed and began engaged other tables in the fact that we had to wait for two hours to get our food. Despite paying full price, we still tipped the server but have to say that management is an absolute sham and they belittled my husband and I in a way I am not accustom to anywhere. The food that we had was delicious but small. But I would have rather eaten at a Denny's  than eat at this customer service disaster of a restaurant.",

We were in good hands with Kristin, our Server. Appetizers were delish! I loved their Spicy Chicken Wings! Chicken Tacos were perfect! This would be ideal to bring my Partner for a nice dinner -- he would love this place.  Good friends, fabulous conversation & great food & service...Five Stars, Baby!!!  CHEERS***",

    "text": "Something is very off and awkward about this place. I found The Mission while looking for upscale Hispanic cuisine during my trip to AZ. From the pictures and some reviews, it seems like a great place to eat, and it really would be if the staff and chef were replaced. We had multiple customer service issues that spanned across multiple employees. -First we came 1 hour and a half earlier of our reservation so we arrange to sit at the bar and socialize until our table was ready. The hostess advised that she could get us something much Sooner than our original reservation, and offered to notify us at the bar when she was ready to seat us. Almost 45 minutes later the waitress never came to us and offer to seat us, so we walked back to the hostess stand and asked of something opened yet. The hostess said \"go ahead and close out of your tab and we'll get your table ready\". So she forgot about us. We closed out our tab and then went to the hostess stand, at which time we were told to wait a few minutes because a table wasn't ready just yet. A few minutes went buy and one of the girls began to walk us back then said \"oh wait they're still clearing the table\". This was sloppy from the start, but was willing to give it a chance, because the food sounded so good. - We were sat at the outside patio area. It was pretty chilly out, and they did have multiple heaters outside to counter the nippy air. A few minutes into our meal we both felt a little chilly, but didn't really make an issue out of it, however, the waitress noticed my girlfriend holding her arms like she was cold, and attempted to turn the heater up, but it seemed like it was running out of gas. A group of 8 sat next to us on the opposite side of the heater and one of them made a comment about the heater needing to be turned up. Their waiter put that request on the back burner and said he would do that in a bit and began taking orders from the rest of the table instead of prioritizing the physical comfort of the guests. The same patrons from that table brought the heater up for a second time after he took all of the orders. Smh, VERY poor decision there. -The food. Oh the food, smh. I got the duck confit, and my girlfriend got the pork shoulder tacos. The tacos were just, okay, nothing to write home about, but the duck confit was bad. Whoever thought it was a good Idea to deep fry it and turn it into chewy duck chicharones needs to go back to culinary school. I felt like I should have been paid to chew through that leathery, crunchy fowl for an hour like I did. We also ordered the chocolate churros, and man were they oily. Like, have you folks even tried those things? They taste like they were fried, then fried again just to let them soak up more oil. They were really bad.  -When handling the check my girlfriend and I split it down the middle, so when the waitress asked us what we wanted to do, my girlfriend and I both said \"yeah we'll just split it down the middle\". The waitress then replied with \"Okay are you sure thats what you want to do?\". I reassured her that it was, then me and my girlfriend both looked at each other with wide eyes like \"what was that weirdness all about?\". Never had someone ask me if I was sure how I wanted to pay for my bill.... Awkward, but then again, it seemed to go along with the overall trend of this place, which was awkward. When I got my bill back I noticed a pamphlet advertising that the restaurant was hiring, and a questionnaire with questions like \"was a manager visible? This was awkward advertising and questioning for an establishment of this size and style. It was also Ironic, because a manager should have spotted the fact that our heater was running out of gas, seeing as it was clearly dim compared to the others. I don't know but nothing sat right with me about this place, and for the money I'd recommend you take your money elsewhere. This establishment is obviously ran by people out of touch with their food and customer service. The pros to this place? Yeah there is a pro, and its in the Decor.",

We always start with tableside guacamole, which manages to taste better than any we've made at home (I think it's the secret sauce!).  The chips are thin, crispy, and served warm.    My husband and I typically get the tacos, which have been good in every variety we've tried, but he's partial to the mahi mahi, while I like the skirt steak.  The street corn is decadent and spicy, and you can get it off the cob if you prefer (easier to eat).  If you make it there for brunch, the corn crab pancakes are salty and savory, and it's not something I've seen in a lot of restaurants before.",

I adored the chandeliers, the lighting, and all the other little details throughout the restaurant. Our waiter, Angel, was extraordinarily personable and accommodating.   We started off our brunch with the fresh guac, made-to-order at your table. it was AMAZING! I could have just eaten it out of the bowl and called it a day. Several of my friends ordered the Pollo a La Brasa y Waffles. I had to try a bite and must say, the waffles were to DIE for! Pure maple with bits of bacon, poured over a cinnamon waffle?! Yes pleaseeeeeeeeeeee! Too bad I am on a competition diet. with that said, the kitchen was able to accommodate my special diet and prepared me a breakfast plate with grilled chicken and egg whites. I tried the grits that came on the side, and they were creamy deliciousness for sure! The Chilaquiles looked incredible and, based on feedback, both the red AND green were very tasty.   I absolutely recommend The Mission to anyone looking for a great place for brunch. I would also HIGHLY recommend making reservations. I made mine a week in advance and was glad I did... the place really fills up quickly around 11:30!",

Supposedly, it has antibacterial properties. Still, I won't be licking the wall.    This joint is cool.  Decor is dark wood, candlelight tables, and swanky music pumping in the background. The staff is attentive.   The star of this meal:  Roast Corn Gorditas. AMAZING.  Highly recommend this trio of goodness.  However, this shouldn't be all you get.  The shaved kale salad had a kick, courtesy of the dressing. The portion is big and can easily serve 3.  Notable mentions: Cheese plate, chicken tacos, and table side Guacamole.   Props to the staff for correcting a snafu with one of our meals and being attentive. When one of our dishes came out with an \"unexpected\" addition, they corrected it immediately by offering us a replacement and comping dessert.    We didn't oblige, but appreciated the server and managers quick attention to rectify the situation.  Dope restaurant, and highly recommend if you are in old town Scottsdale.",

The plate came and there was three piles of meat. It looked good but where are the tortillas?!? I was informed they were under the meat and about the size of a silver dollar, well maybe not that small but no more than three inches. No way you could pick it up and eat it like a taco. I asked and was told it was the chef's signature way of making tacos. Are you frigging kidding me!!! There was an ample amount of meat and it was good but put it on a damn tortilla big enough for me to pick it up and eat it like a taco! On top of it I had to sit and listen to loud rap music. Really, rap music in a Mexican restaurant and it was not even Mexican rap. The place was dark, dungy and the wrong music to make me enjoy a Mexican meal. If just the food was bad I would try it again and order something else. But the whole package just did not work for me, there are better options out there in Phoenix.",

After reading reviews and talking to a few locals we decided to dine at the Mission on a Saturday night.  Our reservations were for late, but we wandered in early and grabbed a seat at the bar.  Sitting next to us a local was ordering and ran through the menu with us...he was so enthusiastic that we decided to get a few appetizers there....they were incredible.  My wife got an wonderful drink that paired with the house guacamole and the braised pork belly perfectly.  The fresh made chips were terrific, and the pork belly portion was bigger than most steaks I have had recently.  Topped with caramelized onions, perfectly spiced, just the right balance of crisp on top and unctuous in the middle.  The appetizers were so incredible we decided to keep going.  The ambience was wonderful, the crowd was sociable and we ordered the Peruvian clam stew, the duck confit and the sweet potato fries....oh, almost forgot the braised beef street tacos.  The portions were all huge, and it was clear that we had ordered too much, but we shared with the folks around us.  The street tacos were good, topped with a crisp slaw and fresh homemade bread and butter pickles.  I would say they were just what we expected.  The duck was excellent, and more than enough for my wife and I to split...and we still couldn't finish it all.  The fries were great....and good fries should never be taken for granted.  But, the dish that trumped them all was the clam stew.   The spicy brown broth was light...almost airy, and its all about the broth.  The stew was just spicy enough, without being overpowering.  I actually had a dream about it that night.... OK, we are obviously fans.  Great ambience, terrific service, warm rich dark decor that makes you feel good when you walk in on a cool winter night, excellent drinks...need I say more.   If you are in the Phoenix area make this a priority stop....you will not be disappointed.",

That just goes to prove that they know it is too dark in the restaurant for some people to read the menu. . . or even see the food.   My sister and her husband ordered the pork shoulder tacos. They liked them very much. But, they also admitted that the pork should tacos are the only thing they will order on the menu. Mission- there are your two stars!  My parents ordered chicken tacos and asked they be mild. They weren't mild.  My mother could barely eat them. Thanks for listening Ms. Waitress.   I ordered the a soup that the waitress said would be very hearty. The soup  tasted. . . well, it had no taste.  It was like watery broth with tasteless pork at the bottom. Not good and not hearty.  I told the waitress that I did not like it and she said, \" Oh, bummer. Can I bring you something else?\"  Since everyone was almost done with their meals I declined and just ate chips and salsa.   The bill?  Yeah, it included my tasteless soup that I did not eat. Pretty tacky.",

This \"Latin American\" food is flavorful and fun, there is really no comparison to anything else around. If you're a fan of pork, you'll be in heaven. Sure, the tacos are tiny but they are filled to the top with the good stuff-meat and seafood. Who cares about the tortilla?  Tableside guacamole is fantastic. Pork belly can't be beat. The pork tacos, seafood tacos (especially the scallops), and the beef short ribs are some of the best things I have ever tasted. The drinks are expensive but they are yummy. I like the presentation of the tortillas on the salt blocks and the salt wall around the kitchen is pretty cool. The decor is very nicely done with two huge patios that are perfect for Arizona evening dining or enjoying a cocktail in the sun. They get knocked one star because service is not consistent. I have been here four times now, twice the service was over-the-top, best waiter/waitress I've ever had. The other two times were just average wait staff, not bad, but why go back to the Honda when you've had the Bentley? Otherwise, everything else is perfect.",

The short rib tacos were small, but tasted excellent. Between the app and the tacos (3 to an order) I didn't have room for dessert. I wish I did though as the next table over was raving about the pumpkin bread pudding. I would have loved to try it. Service was very good (friendly, knowledgeable and made good recommendations) if a little slow (the place was busy early on a Thur evening).",

In the day, it was totally different very laid back, warm and inviting; especially if you are seated at a table outside with the sun shining down on you. The guacamole is amazing and the street tacos were great with a unique twist.  Also, if you want to experience great food without spending too much, lunch is a great option.",

Best guacamole I've ever had! The spices and pumpkin seeds worked amazingly with the chillies....ah I want some so bad right now!    My skirt steak was just ok...very chewie but it's not the best cut of steak overall. Didn't get pics of the tacos we had but my pork belly cubano was awesome! It was sooooo good! I didn't get an egg like the picture on the menu tho...not sure why. Anyways, this place is cool and would def come back!",

The salsa here is so good! A little bit of a spice with smokey flavors. We also ordered the tableside gauc to start, the flavor was great but it was a little chunky for my preference.   For our main meal we got the short rib and chicken tacos, both were delicious. We also had the green beans with bacon, highly recommend if you are trying to fool yourself about being healthy by getting veggies ;)",

They ask you what spicy range you like as well.  I met a client here for lunch and we both had the Pollo plate, which came with the most delicious sauce on a juicy, grilled chicken, and colorful fries made from sweet potatoes & regular potatoes.  We also loved our guacamole with perefectly crispy chips, not too thick, and not too thin.   Their brunch and drinks menu both look like something to come back here for. Also, if you're visiting on a hot summer day, as I was, you will love that they are dark and air conditioned inside.  Definitely give them a try!",

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  My party of six couldn't have been taken care of any better, and our server was absolutely out of this world. The great atmosphere at The Mission is complimented by things like table-side guac stations and a great indoor/outdoor setup. Excellent. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  The Mission could get away with charging much higher prices than they do, and I was shocked to find that virtually nothing on the brunch menu was priced higher than $15.00 for what were generous portions. Well done. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  My green chilaquiles dish was excellent, and my girlfriend's cinnamon pecan waffles were worthwhile as well. Solid flavors all around. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Definitely, I'll come back for the tacos. Star.",

When you order tacos for $14, you kinda expect a full size taco. NO, these were 3 STREET size tacos for $14. Fish tacos were fishy, had to be sent back. Totally not worth it.  And our waitress KENNEDY?? She was horrible!! She acted like we were a total disturbance. Waited forever to take our order. And the same when we needed another drink. And another thing, who pays for chips and salsa at a Mexican food restaurant???? This place is totally not worth it!! And do not order the table side guacamole. It is only enough for like two people. They only use ONE avacado. For $14, you'd expect it to be for at four. This is a MEXICAN Food restaurant!!! Should not be outrageously over priced.",

Polo and waffles were well prepared but the secret was the bacon syrup that was poured on top.  My partner in crime for the day enjoyed the taco bar. The chef be a master of the pork.

BUT the music was deafeningly LOUD, and, regrettably, it wasn't classical guitar or even flamenco music, which would have been appropriate for such a latin setting, but was techno-dance music, usually one word lyrics repeated 100 times on the beat.  Additionally, the tables are VERY close together, so with the combination of the loud music and other customers on either side of us having to shout to be heard, my husband and I couldn't really have a normal conversation over our tiny table.  Although we loved the food--every bite was delicious--we couldn't wait to leave.  Never a good sign for any restaurant.",

There is free street parking available all around the restaurant. The establishment is large enough that it has a few different outdoor seating options both in front and back as well as plenty of indoor table/bar seating. We started with the tableside guacamole in which they came up to you in made in front of you with a variety of ingredients based on your interests. The 2 ingredients that were unique to this one were cotija cheese and pepitas. The overall size was just enough for the 2 of us and delicious but would be a bit small for a group which is unfortunate as the price is a hefty $14.  As for our entree, we decided to share the grilled street corn and kobe dog. The grilled street corn can be served on the cob or shaved off in which we went for the latter as it is easier. The kobe dog is one of their specialty entrees. This is a hot dog made with kobe beef wrapped in bacon topped with pintos, cotijja, and onion served in a brioche bun. Surprisingly, this was a large dish as a hot dog normally never fills me up and I enjoyed it as it was a different concept.  Good spot for food with great service, but a little bit pricey.",

The ambiance is very nice and cute, although I will say it was very dark. We sat outside and they had large heaters, so it was perfect.   Started with some margaritas! Would definitely recommend the cucumber jalapeno and the blood orange. We also had the tableside guac, which they make at your table. We asked them to make it spicy and put everything in it ( you get to decide what you want to put in it). We also all wanted to try to Brussels sprouts tacos- they were delicious. It comes with three tacos (they are little), so we each had one.    For my meal I had the grouper, it was absolutely delicious. It was cooked perfectly. My dad had the salmon, which he loved but said he wished he had ordered my grouper after trying mine! My mom had the roasted butternut squash tacos, and she enjoyed them but said she liked the Brussels sprouts ones more!   For dessert we had the pumpkin bread pudding, which was absolutely delicious. I would 100% recommend this dessert.",

Don't quite know why it has taken the 6 th or 7 th time of coming here to see this place for what it is. Service is so so, not bad, but sub par for the price tag! With so many more great Mexican Restraunt out there, why spend the outrageous sums of money to go here",

    "text": "Mission Old Town rocks.  Excellent atmosphere, delicious food, attentive staff, overall a great place.  The reason why I took 1 star off is due to the extreme price and portion sizes.  Super expensive and very small portions.  Now with that said - delicious.  Truly truly good.  My co worker and I each got a set of tacos which were excellent and a table side guac.  I ordered the Barbacoa and she ordered the steak.  Barbacoa is definitely the way to go.  Very tender, super juicy and delicious.  The tacos are about 2 bites each - so...I'd say order 2, but then you'd be paying twice the price.  Either way, I do plan on going back as the atmosphere was awesome and the food really was that good.  Check them out!",

    "text": "Wow! Wow! Wow! This place has some awesome food! :)  We came here on a Sunday night for dinner. I wish we had made a reservation in advance because this place was packed with people (how you know if a restaurant is good)! Apparently all the locals flock here for food. The hostess of the night told us that the wait would be about 45 minutes. We sucked it up. It ended up being about an hour wait. But looking back it was worth the wait!   Our waitress seemed very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations about the food. If it is your first time coming to this restaurant, taking the wait staff's recommendations about what to get might not be a bad idea!   For appetizer, we started with some chips and Salas and the table side guacamole. The Salas was very good, and had a smoky flavor to it. Definitely more layers of complexity  than just your regular tomatoey-based Salas. The table side gaucamole was probably the best guac I have ever had. The taste was very complex and fresh, with lime cilantro, chili, onions, etc. It was the bomb! Definitely get it if you are into guac!  For entree, we got the green chile something duck. The waitress recommended getting either a pork or duck dish as these are the chef's specialty. She was right! The duck was cooked perfectly! Crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside. I was thinking how the chef could have gotten the duck to be so tender. Maybe it was sous vided for sometime? The garnish and toppings on the duck dish was interesting,  combining with different flavors.   For dissert, we got the pumpkin pudding. It was good! The pomegranate seeds in the syrup really added a good touch to the pudding.  The service here was top-notched. The wait staff know their menu and can make good recommendations. The empty dishes and glasses were taken away promptly and not left sitting on our table. The ambience of the restaurant is low key dim light. The patio section of the restaurant was better for having a conversation. The inside of the restaurant was buzzing and popping. I would say this is a great place to take yourself out for a treat or take your special someone on a date.  Overall, my experience was great! This place is definitely on the pricey side, but I felt my money was worth spent. I would definitely come back if I was in the area again. :)",

We started with a margarita which seemed fitting regardless of the fact that I am not generally a tequila fan. It was well presented, not too salty and really pretty good.  Next we each ordered Grilled Street Corn and Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze. The Street Corn, I am told consisted of such things as skewered corn, butter, chile paprika and cilantro. Really delicious - you could make a meal of it. The pork belly was even better. Red onion, lettuce, peanut, cola with a hint of lime. I would love to figure out how to prepare this at home and have it taste the same.  Give this restaurant a try. Good value for your money and a treat for your taste buds.",

Probably 4 different people checked on us during our time there and we never had an empty glass.  The chips and white dip are great and the small chicken tacos were messy and very spicy but to my liking; just a tip to whoever orders them--you have to like spicy and if you do, I promise you'll love them; otherwise I'd choose something else.  I also mentioned to the bartender this shot I had about 20 years ago; I told him the name and what I thought were the ingredients and before I knew it he had it already googled and asked if I wanted that.  Impressive!  Such a nice bartender and the place has a nice ambience.  4 stars instead of 5 because the floors are weird;  you really have to watch your step in several places in front.  You'll see what I mean if you go.  Overall, loved it and will return.",

I live in Boston.  Old Town anything to me means pre-Revolutionary War, not the Wild West.  So what a fun and different look this area is!    Bonanza meets Beverly Hills.    Ok, on to the restaurant...  Being by myself, I ventured through the cool outdoor patio area and into the renovated historic building and found a seat at the bar.   Greeted by a friendly face, I ordered a drink and took a look a the menu.    I was surprised to see how limited it was, but it didn't really matter, I found something I could sink my teeth into.  I ordered the short rib tacos and brussel sprout tacos.   The bartender said \"You know you're ordering 6 taco's right?\"  Haha.  Yes I know.   Being on a low carb diet, my intentions are just to eat the innards and these are about half the size of normal tacos.  Although a tad on the pricey side for the amount you get, both were absolutely delicious and I highly recommend this combo!  Getting a nice flavorful beef followed by a tangy vegetable was making my taste buds do a happy dance!      Based on my short but tasty experience, I can see why this is a fan favorite.   Located in a popular and trendy area, super cool atmosphere, friendly staff, and tasty food.   I'm glad I went and would definitely come back again!",

    "text": "The Mission is modern contemporary Mexican restaurant in Old Scottsdale.  This a place that you will need to make a reservation. It is always packed and every seat is full. They have a nice patio seating area outside and romantic seating inside. Inside lighting is pretty much candle-light and some people might not like the darkness. We enjoyed a nice romantic dinner with table side guacamole and multiple flights of different types of tequila. The food is not your typical Mexican food. It has a modern twist but still great flavor. Our meal was nice, but expect to pay $30 a dish. It was a memorable evening, with great environment, good food, and lots of top shelf tequila.",

The table side guacamole is wonderful and you can have them make it to your taste of spiciness. We had the prom shoulder tacos, the skirt steak tacos and the Brussels sprouts tacos. All three were delicious, although you can get the sprouts as a side for less money. We also tried the fried banana for dessert and we're not disappointed. If you're looking for high quality fresh Mexican food, this is where to go.",

This weekend, I had to attend a picnic and brought guacamole.  I stole the idea from the mission to add the pepitas and it was a big hit.   We also sampled some of their tacos, the carne asada being the favorite in the group.  The back patio is a great place to spend a meal or two.",

    "text": "So table side guac is absolutely amazing. Outside that, would have felt more satisfied by Chipotle.  Was in AZ on vacation and this got rave reviews.  Could tell by the place it would be overpriced, but for good tacos in the SW, so be it.  What I ended up with was some braised meat and a few sanddoller sized shells. No cheese, sauce, onions, cilantro - just a hunk of meat and a few shells. I get it, it's fancy and not into the whole fill you up, awesome food at a good price type game. But, if you're on vacation in the SW and you'd like to get some good texmex or Mexican food, don't go here. It's a nice date place/place to be seen, not a \"gotta get better food than I can get at home\" place.",

    "text": "I went to the Mission last week with my family and here's how our visit was:  Our waitress was Amazing! I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shout out. She knew the menu completely and was very informative on how things were prepared and provided great suggestions on what to order which were helpful since it was hard to read the menus in the dimly lit restaurant. Our table was constantly being checked on by other employees checking on drinks and chip refills.   I ordered a traditional mojito and my mom got the Cadillac blood orange margarita. Both were delicious and you can definitely taste the fresh ingredients used. We ordered the table side guacamole and pork shoulder tacos which were incredible and was perfect for sharing. For our main courses we ordered the green chili duck confit which was packed with various flavors and textures. The mole kinda overpowered the dish with a strong nutmeg taste but was still a great dish. My husband ordered the chorizo porchetta with white bean puree and it was fork tender and melted in your mouth, the puree was unbelievable. My mom and stepdad ordered the driver scallops and you could smell their plates from across the room. Regardless of the strong odor they said it was a very delicious plate. Our server kindly packed up our leftovers and suggested dessert options.   Overall it was a great dinner. The restaurant was packed by the time we left and the close tables made it difficult to squeeze out of without giving the table next to you a face full of butt.   We will definitely be back for another visit and look forward to trying different options on the menu. Thank You for providing a delicious Mexican meal that isn't just slathered in sauce and melted cheese!",

    "text": "I liked this place. First off, our server was outstanding. He had a great command of the menu and was as funny and irreverent as we. Good servers are hard to find, and this fellow was superb. I think that even if the food had not been great, I still would have given high marks just for the excellent service.   We had an early reservation, but it was dark inside. To be honest, I didn't have enuf light to read the dang menu, so I just told the guy to feed us... He did not disappoint. We had that table prepared guacamole, which didn't really blow my skirt up as much as it has been represented. I guess if you have never had it before, the procedure is worthwhile, kind of like going to Lawrys in LA and having your prime rib carved table side. Very cool, but doesn't make the stuff taste any better. KWIM?  Anyhoo, it's guacamole for Goodness sake. Ho-hum. BUT, the rest of the meal was awesome. Had the Pork belly, which was tender, succulent, well presented, and something that I could eat again and again. We had the duck thingie which was just over the top tasty, a couple of taco dishes and a great pumpkin bread pudding. Wow, that was a great meal. I'm going back for sure. There are so many good things to try, I'm gonna eat my way through the menu.   Oh, the desk staff were nice and not snooty and the bathroom was impeccably clean; a mark of a restaurant owner that pays attention to the details. The place was loud, so not the best for quiet talk, but we met the folks at the next table and they were a hoot. Unexpected and completely delightful. We had a great time and Big Larry is going back for sure. The entire bill, BTW, was less than a hun, which was quite pleasant to see. Gave the server 30%. He was that good. Check this place out. They had it right for us most certainly.",

We also got the street corn app, which was good, but a disappointment. For $7, I expected a bit more corn and less mayo - I was looking for something more traditional. It was good though, I won't deny that. I just wouldn't order it again. The drinks were also a bit of a disappointment; I'm a fair bartender at home and the blood orange margarita was something I could have made. Lots of ice and nothing special; tasty, again, but nothing I'd order again, especially for $13. Beer was priced right though. The star of the show was the dessert. We ordered the chocolate pastilla; damn. The french press coffee is enough to share for 2, was delicious (!) and came with a bit of shortbread. I'd order that 1000x over.",

We were visiting Scottsdale from out of town and Mission was recommended to us, and it was by far some of the best food and service we have had, ever. First of all, the ambience and atmosphere is amazing. We were lucky enough to have an amazing server, Amanda, who gave us an incredible experience by sending out all of her favorite dishes and we couldn't have asked for anything better. We started with tableside guacamole and it was hands down the best I've ever had (that's really just the theme here.) Everything Amanda recommended was something that we most likely wouldn't have ordered, including dessert, but enjoyed so much that we were so grateful to have had her! Seriously, I can't say enough how much we enjoyed this restaurant, the food, the service and the experience. Highly highly recommend!",

The atmosphere is amazing, the staff welcoming, the food unique and tasty... oh, and the drinks go down easy too!  The Mission has become Jared's second home - he's there much more than I am!  I go for an occasional drink or dinner.  My favorite menu item is the tableside prepared guacamole.  It's fantastic!  I am also a huge fan of the white bean puree, the street corn, and the salmon.  I wish they had some lighter options on the menu though - just a suggestion on behalf of those of us that are health-conscious!  If you enjoy Latin-inspired fare, for sure go check out The Mission... Or at the very least, go in for a drink and some guacamole.  Look for Jared at the bar when you're there!  I\"ll for sure be excited to celebrate The Mission's one year anniversary in late October.  I'm sure it will be one helluva party!  It always is at The Mission!",

The tortilla chips were very good as well.  The waiter took about 4 minutes describing how great the porchetta and chorizo roll were.  It was \"OK\" nothing to write home about, the pork was way to charred on the outside and the chorizo was nicely seasoned but dry.  All in all, it was a nice evening and experience.

    "text": "After doing my Yelp research, this was on my dinner short list. This coincided with a recommendation from a hotel, so off we went. We sat outside in the nice little courtyard. Patio heaters kept things warm. The menu is just long enough. We started with the duck confit empanadas (great!) and got a serving of the pork shoulder tacos to share between the 3 of us (quite good, but the meat could have had a bit more flavour). The crispy cola pork was terrific; crispy flavourful pork on a lettuce cup.  For my main course I selected the port shoulder and chorizo roll. Our awesome waitress warned us that some people found it could be a bit dry because it gets cooked 3 times. So while you're starting with a piece of meat with plenty of fat, it gets a bit dryer. I tried anyhow and agree a bit -- it was still very good and I don't regret my selection. I tasked my friend's short rib and that was also very good.  Overall, great experience made by solid food, excellent service, and nice ambiance.",

The amount of thought and intentionality is evident in the way that many small details are well attended to including the use of Himalayan Rock Salt bricks to keep tortillas warm to the interior reflecting a classic Latin American mission through lighting and catholic symbology.

From the front patio, to the inside space and the back patio, each one offers a unique experience.  Being on the back patio reminds of my years living in Mexico City with the high walls, the very same marble surrounding the fountain, right down to the shade structure.  It feels like at any moment they could move the tables and start dancing. The food is ridiculous and the staff knows too much about all of it ;-) I could sit on that back patio and relax (read, drink) for days.  You forget you're in Scottsdale.",

I don't know if it's just seasonal, but anytime of the year it would be a treat! We had the MAHI MAHI TACOS and the SHORT RIB TACOS. Both were savory, but much smaller than we expected (think medallion size), and the short ribs could have been more tender. They were a bit dry, but still tasty.   CONS: TABLE-SIDE GUACAMOLE. If you have a low tolerance for spicy flavors, definitely get mild or not spicy at all. We ordered the medium, and it was wayyyy to spicy, practically inedible for us. The PORTION sizes were far too small and the food was expensive for what was on the plate. Also, the MIMOSA was ok, but was a bit strong. I was expecting more orange juice with a splash of champagne and maybe a strawberry, but this was champagne with a splash of orange juice.",

We also ordered the duck empanadas which were out of this world; rich, with great texture and flavor. I had the steak tacos as my main dish which were good but not outstanding. I'm wishing I had conned someone in my party to split the pork shoulder tacos with me. We ended with the pumpkin bread pudding which was just as good as everyone says.   Great vibe and decor although the lighting was so dim it caused eye strain and dried out my contacts.",

We decided to go here for some appetizers and drinks since it was still early and then head out to another recommended restaurant later.  The food: We ordered the Table side guac and the crispy pork w/cola lime glaze.  The guac was excellent, and we couldn't get enough, but the real surprise was the salsa that they brought over when we got there.  This salsa was AWESOME.  The waitress mentioned that they roast the tomatoes and make their own salsa at the restaurant.  If I thought for a second I could get it on the plane home I would have asked her give me a cup of it for the road.  SO GOOD.  Then we had the crispy pork, which was a perfectly cooked pork belly thing with sweet barbecue type sauce (but better!) on it.  So good.  We should have stayed here and had dinner instead of going somewhere else.  After we finished dinner at the other restaurant I suggested (only half joking) that we go back to The Mission and have a second dinner... but it was too late.  The decor of the restaurant was really cool, very dark.  Unfortunately, I was there with another male co-worker, so the ambiance was a bit wasted on us...  I highly recommend.  If I am ever in the area again, I'm definitely staying for dinner!",

I liked the crispiness of the pork belly and how you get an overall nice flavor.   We next had a kale salad. I loved this salad. It had a great dressing with a kick to it. I am not sure what all went into it, though I will have it when I make it back to The Mission.  For our final course, we had three different types of tacos. The beef tacos were delicious. The chicken tacos were very tender. I think the pork tacos were likely my favorite -- they were juicy and tender. I was surprised by how tiny the tortillas were -- that wasn't a negative, just unexpected.",

The back patio is more spacious and offers heat lamps at night. The inside dining room is gorgeous but can be loud. Favorites are: Pork shoulder tacos, skirt steak tacos, mahi mahi tacos, grilled corn, tableside guacamole. Margaritas are great. Just learned of the \"Sunday pig out\" - $16 per person for all you can eat taco bar (this may change from week to week but it was pork shoulder tacos last Sunday) and half price bloody mary's, mimosas, bottles of wine.",

You know middle of the day sex that you weren't expecting and now it's all you're thinking about and you find yourself smiling all day long ...yeah baby The mission was that damn good .  At first glance,  * curbside*  it is aesthetically pleasing,  and as you make your way inside,  the beautiful people greet you,  and escort you to your table ( our's was outside on the courtyard style patio) even in broad daylight this is a sexy place with it large brick fireplace and intimate seating ( corner booth).  Anthony  our waiter was nothing short of fabulous. You could see he takes pride in doing his job well. He asked if it was our first time and like a gentle lover he explained what we were about to experience while we let our hands and eyes travel over the heavy soft leather covered delicate pages of the menu .  The Mission is a Spanish- French fusion style eatery The chef was trained in French Cuisine and he has melded that training carefully into the Spanish style dishes .  I had the Brisket Torta (actually i think it had me)  thinly sliced  tender beef that literally melted on my tongue that was lightly drenched in a mild yet flavorful BBQ type sauce that sat atop coleslaw, which added a cool crispness to the hot soft beef. This Torta was texturally stimulating and the Aji Amarillo gave my taste buds a subtle barely there sting. Nothing within the soft bun competed for flavor it was harmonious ..A Fait Accompli . Presentation was lovely. The made before your eyes table side Guacamole is    wonderful. My companions lunch consisted of 3 petite beef tacos that looked amazing.  The food is not to be rushed as something so well executed needs to be savored, felt .  Like an afternoon of great lovemaking,  I  left limp, floaty, sated,  eager for more. A wicked soft grin upon my lips as i walked away. And  i had to turn back and look one more time ...  Mission accomplished ......an orgasmic experience ! 5 stars for the stars in my eyes ....  Update:  I have eaten at The mission at least twice per month. I love their Mango and Jimaca salad, and the Spinach & Date salad.   For dessert the fried bananas rock! But,  the pumpkin bread pudding...OMG OFF THE HOOK.",

Maybe he was just hating for some reason  I ordered a corona and my tacos came out before I even got my corona. Whatta? We sat close to the bar/entrance so we were able to ask the hostess for help many times. I think she mention something to Angel, the manager. He immediately came over and gave us great service, apologized for the delays and poor service, offered me a free beer and a desert for my wife. He saved the day.

If you go here you must get the table side guacamole it is the best you will ever have and is also fun to watch them make it right at your table. I love the chicken tacos, as well as the pork, but the butternut squash tacos also are amazing if you want something vegetarian. They have the best margaritas in town, great atmosphere, always awesome service. Make sure you make a reservation as they are always busy!",

What made both dishes so outstanding was the sauces that accompanied the dishes. The mustard with the steak complemented the meat. The duck was very tender and juicy. The peanuts, corn and  apple puree were incredible. The best duck I have ever enjoyed in my life.",

Our waiter was very professional and knowledgeable about the menu and had excellent recommendations, the outdoor courtyard table right in front of the fireplace was as romantic as it gets, and the entire atmosphere was dreamy.  The food did not disappoint neither.  We had the pork belly to start with- cooked perfectly tender with avocado mousse and spicy mustard on the side- the boyfriend even said it was better than his entree!    I had the pork shoulder as main and the boyfriend had the flank steak.  The pork shoulder was charred and crispy on the edge and tender on the inside, every bite was heaven, paired with a very good Merlot.  The flank steak was very good, according to the boyfriend, as well.  We were too full to get dessert but I heard good things about the chocolate churro.  Although pricy, but definitely worth a visit.",

The tacos were small street tacos but so delicious. Will definitely be back. And will try the table side guacamole.",

Small tight tables, elbow to elbow with the next table.  It was dark lighting and I mean DARK to the point of needing a flashlight to read the menu.  The menu had soft leather covers and was filled with mysterious fu fu selections even the staff said was hard to understand.  We order guacamole prepared tableside at $12, fresh, pretty good.  And we ordered a cheese plate, five or six bites but meant to look pretty.  My wife ordered an entry salad which arrived and clearly could feed three people.  I ordered scallops, got six large ones, pretty tasty.  And I had a side of chipotle grits, so so.  We had Corona Lite.  Total bill with tip:  $120.  Yes, there was an active bar scene.  Yes, the staff was super attentive and very nice.  Background music and noise was too loud.  Parking across the street was free.  All in all, we would not recommend this restaurant.",

The company's solid concepts and restaurateurs have produced great restaurants throughout the valley.  The atmosphere of the restaurant demonstrates exactly why the name is \"The Mission\" Nestled in Old Town Scottsdale, next to an old Mission church. I believe the goal of this restaurant is to bring the guest such a great experience that is not often matched, thus making it a \"mission\" busy, hard working people. Top notch service, Everybody is in a good mood.   The actual experience is what provides the customer with what The Mission's \"mission\" actually is.   The Drinks are just what you are looking for when you come to a place like Scottsdale. Perfectly balanced, and cold. Beautiful bar and interior with great selection. Mixologists putting on a show with craft cocktails and great service.  The Food is very unique and it is a large menu. They have lunch, brunch, \"off hours\", and dinner. Some of these menu items are truly reasons to come to Arizona. Almejas Al Vapor, Pork Belly Pibil, Grouper, Scallops, Foie Gras, Duck Confit & Empanada, the list doesnt end. Fresh Fish brought in daily and trust me, it is a lot fresher than the fish at the markets in the Valley.   This is one of the best restaurants.",

    "text": "Overall it was very Underwhelming. After reading numerous reviews of this place on TripAdvisor I decided to give it a try during my visit to Arizona. Sadly it missed the mark. To the extent that I wonder what the others who have rated this highly have used as a benchmark. I travel weekly for work & therefore eat out often across the nation so I have a lot of experiences to compare this to.   Food:  I was torn between the fish or chicken. I asked if I could get 1 chicken and 2 fish however I was told they do not allow mixing meats. So I asked if I ordered fish tacos if I could have 1 fried and 2 grilled. I was then told customizations are not allowed. Being mindful of my health I prefer not to over indulge in fried food however I definitely wanted to try a variety since I don't live in AZ & reviews made this sounds like the best place ever. Ultimately I ordered the chicken tacos since my server said it was made of grilled chicken breast and I think it's tough to mess up a chicken taco. I was wrong. There were 3 tacos for $12 and about the size of my palm (I have small hands); they do not come with any sides. Contrary to what I was told they were not chicken breast. The flavor of the chicken was subpar and I had to pull off the fat that outlined the pieces of chicken. Aside from this I wasn't offered chips and salsa so I'm Not sure what the requirements are for that but I imagine it's a purchase of some sort.   I was surprised to learn that a restaurant attempting to classify itself has fine dining or upscale doesn't make any effort to accommodate guests. Quite different from Most restaurants that truly fall into that class. Quite honestly there is more hospitality and service at Chick-fil-A and the food is better.   Drink: I ordered The Missionary which is a signature cocktail. They blend red sangria and their house margarita. It's more sweet than I like for cocktails. I asked my server if it was sweet before I ordered it and he said no. I had asked for drink recommendations. He didn't have much to offer however I heard him tell the table next to me how much he enjoyed the organic margarita. I wish I had received similar advice  Service: One of the least accommodating restaurants I've ever been to. Working in the industry as a consultant perhaps I have a high bar. But for a high price tag and high claim in dining class this restaurant would do themselves  a service by researching trends in customer expectations and preferences. They will learn a number of things including that trends indicate customers prefer restaurants that allow customization, and highly value customer service.",

It seems like the best city in the country for a work trip!   The Mission had two private tables set up on the outdoor patio. The outdoor fireplace was a big hit with our crowd. We started with wonderful chips and delicious, fresh guacamole. I truly could have sat there and eaten nothing but guacamole all night and been happy as a clam, but they just kept bringing out delicious food. We had a Taco Tuesday menu that consisted of several different tacos. The beef was my favorite, because I loved the cut of the meat (skirt) and the flavor of the seasonings. I also got to try the chicken and the pork shoulder tacos, but the steak stood out to me.   The margaritas were plentiful and so delicious. They just kept coming, and we kept drinking them. I think some other people ordered specialty cocktails, but I'll always have the margarita when dining Mexican, especially at a such a renowned place as the Mission.  I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale, which I hope is sometime very soon.",

    "text": "The Mission is a wonderful restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale and priced accordingly.  We came here this past Friday night around 5;30 or so.  Over drinks and our meal, we keep discussing the term In-elasticity of demand.  That's economics, for how high you can raise prices before consumers will start cutting back.    You see the food at The Mission is excellent!   It's delicious!  It's outstanding!  But, judging on how they pack them in, the investors who own The Mission, could easily raise prices by 10 or 20%, and no one would blink an eye.  Hopefully, you're not reading my Yelp Reviews for Economics lessons. But to find out about the dining experience and food.  LOL   Since there is no Happy Hour at The Mission, we were lucky to get a table near the bar.  We ordered the \"made at your table\" Guacamole for $12.00.  Excellent!  If you do not believe me -- checkout the nearly half dozen photos other Yelpers have posted for this one menu item.  Yes, it's very good.  They cut up one avocado, add a pinch of salt, red onion, half a lime, cilantro, pine nuts and some grated mexican cheese. Creamy texture and yummy.  We ordered a glass of Sangria for $8.00. and a Mohito for $12.00.  Both were very good, though each had too much ice.  We also ordered off the appetizers menu the Chicken Anticuchos for $8.00, and Skirt Steak tacos for $12.00.   The chicken comes on two skewers, with a very nice tasting mole that dominates.  It's seasoned with raisin, balsamic, sesame ,cocoa and peanuts.  Very nice.  The three small steak tacos were marinated in Tecate and smoked in their back yard. It's the smokey taste that makes the dish unique.  It also comes with green chili salsa, some diced avocado, cilantro and cotija on top.  These too were delicious and hit the spot.    A shout-out to fellow Yelp'er Pepper T, who coined the term \"Petite proteins\" in her review.  Nicely said Pepper!  I believe it's nouveau cuisine.  We ordered one more drink before asking for the check.  The damage came to just over $69 including taxes, but before tip.  As I mention in the begining, The Mission gets very crowded and can feel claustrophobic.  It's also dark inside, and at times can be very noisy.  After the show at the Permorming Art Center down the street, we thought about coming back for dessert. But there was about twenty customers waiting outside to be seated.  Maybe next time.  In-elascity of Demand as they say.",

    "text": "Here in January to visit my sister and nephew.  Got conned into going to Old Scotsdale.  \"It has an Old West vibe\" she says.  Yes.  If the old west was populated by fannypack-wearing seniors recently disgorged from tour buses and had tourist-trap souvenir joints as far as the eye could see.  But I digress.  Every get insanely hungry?  So hungry, you're \"HANGRY\", a combination of being angry and hungry?  That was my state of mind that afternoon.  I used Yelp to look for nearby places that might sate my appetite but, for some reason, I either couldn't find them or, upon arriving at the doorstep, they appeared less-than-favorable.  So we settled on The Mission.  We walked past it a few times before the \"HANGER\" took over me.  In we went.  The inside looked upscale and cool.  Dimly lit and nicely appointed.  We opted to sit outside. The decor was appropriately Santa Fe without overdoing the theme.  You knew you were in a place that specialized in Mexican or Tex-Mex cuisine but they weren't desperately beating you over the head with a two-pound burrito to drive the point home.  Wife had the Mojito and I had the Primarita to start.  Dangerously drinkable.  So nice I had it twice.  But, thankfully, I didn't morph into Danny Trejo and start throwing crucifix-hilted knives into nearby customers and waitstaff.  It was fresh, clean, thirst-quenching, brilliant.  The waiter was excellent and did and good job of up-selling us to the table-side guacamole.  Prepared fresh, another gentleman came and created luscious, flavorful guac in a stone mortar that would have been the envy of any alchemist.  The fresh ingredients certainly played a major role in the quality of this guacamole but I think the theater was a significant portion as well.  ORDER THIS IF YOU GO.  You will weep bitter, bitter tears in your pillow that night if you skip it.  Allergies to guacamole or anything that tastes awesome are your only excuses.  Wife had the skirt steak tacos. I had a bite and found it to be excellent.  Well-seasoned and juicy.  I had the pork tacos which, mysteriously, are only listed as a 10-pack serving2.  I enjoyed mine greatly finding them moist and flavorful.  If you are in Old Scottsdale, come here for a big-ass lunch or early dinner.  You won't be disappointed.  Have a few Primaritas.  You'll thank me.",

Our waiter, Jeff was extremely versed on the extensive menu & helped us pick out just the right starters & main dishes. The 1st plate was lettuce cups filled with BBQ Pork Belly and assorted garnish. They were excellent. The main dish was roast pork shoulder with a habanero & pineapple glaze. 10 small hand made corn tortillas accompanied this with assorted garnish. Onions, cilantro & Cotiga cheese. We also ordered the table side guacamole & salsa.  This dish was to die for. So many flavors going on.  Just awesome. I washed this down with a ginger pineapple mojito. Which was also great.   Throughout the dinner, Jeff was checking up on us. What a pleasant and enjoyable young man. Needless to say we loved this place. Can't recommend it enough.  Thank you for this culinary exquisite experience.",

The table service was very good and our server was very attentive and helpful when trying to decide on what to order. I got the pork shoulder tacos and the flavor was spot on and I felt like I could have eaten 10 orders of them! It had a nice pineapple and cilantro flavor pairing. Overall, we were so happy we found this place while visiting the area.   The only reason I could not give 5 stars is because of the front of the house. When we entered, the hostess originally told us that it would be about 5 or 10 minutes and then in the next sentence she changed it to 15-20 minutes and said that they were trying to give the kitchen a break. That just seemed weird to me. I just can't give a 5 star rating when your first point of contact is unpleasant. Other than that, this restaurant is a must try!",

That said, we almost always order the table side guacamole. Entrees change based on ingredients and chef preferences, but on our most recent visit I enjoyed the Pork and chorizo dish. The flavors were rich and the textures intentionally playful. I hope it stays on the menu for a while!   I can't wait for my next excuse to go again! Get reservations early and if you sit on the swamp cooled patio, ask for a table further from the fan unless you enjoy eating your own hair. Aside from that tip, the patio is a great choice!!   Oh, and if you've somehow saved room for dessert, the pumpkin bread pudding is UNREAL. Get it.",

I'm on the wagon, so I ordered a Diet Coke and the table-side guacamole. Once the guacamole was prepared (perfectly) he came back to recommend some items on the menu. I took his taco recommendation and never looked back. OMG. I hate all 3, folks. Oink. Oink. His service was impeccable and I could tell that he was a seasoned server.

    "text": "No one gets five stars from me  I enjoyed this place during what would have been happy hour--but they have none here, and they probably don't need it, either  I can't tell for sure whether this is a go-to spot for people on a regular basis, or whether it was just packed for early Saturday night dining and night-life. Either way, the place was happenin' around 6pm, with an entire cougar table right next to me (had to shield myself from being ravaged!) and almost every seat at the bar area being taken  The bar was full-service and I proceeded to order a beer and was given water and offered chips 'n salsa right away. My bartender/waitress was Lexi, a stunningly beautiful blond chick who was very attentive to my stay  I opted to get the guac with my chips because it had grated parmesan and pumpkin seeds which was different (thanks to Yelpers for that suggestion), as well as the short-rib tacos.   My rib tacos didn't have the spot-on flavor you want from an excellent short-rib, but for the price and time of day I can't complain  Very dark and fascinatingly-candle-lit environment with a modern twist to a Spanish decor. Everyone looked very happy and well-taken-care-of here. I would definitely return to order a regular-sized meal during the week if I find myself in Scottsdale...although I promised myself I'd try every restaurant in this city, so that might not be happening for a long while  Verdict: worth a trip, but avoid the happy-hour time frame if you're not into huge crowds",

My server only stopped by to see if I needed another drink and to drop the check. Another server rolled her eyes at the guests.

Ambiance is nice, but not being able to see your food is not.  Also, when you have a reservation (this happened both days), to be told that you only have until a certain time to eat is really obnoxious.  Before we were seated we were told they could only honor our reservation if we finished by 7p (our reservation was at 5:15p).  I get they are busy...but that did not give us a warm fuzzy feeling.

    "text": "If you want a dimly lit, romantic but yet also vibrant scene with great food, this is the place. It is one of my favorites in Scottsdale and a must when I am here. The backlit, translucent Onyx really sets the mood as you enter; its very unique in it's application and is warm and inviting. To the food: We started off with a pozole, which I make at home as often as possible and the Peruvian (Almejas el Vapor) clam stew; simply the best dish on the menu and I cannot get enough of, to be honest. For our second course, we ordered a Pork Pibil and the Duck Confit. The duck came out incredibly dry but the Pork was very tender and flavorful. For our third and final course we had the Pork Belly with Cola glaze and the table side guacamole. All in all the cuisine was very good however, the rest of our experience wasn't. From inception they somehow lost my reservation so what was supposed to be 7:30, became 8:15 as we awaited a table. Once the Manager was made aware of this, he approached me as I attempted to fight for cocktails at the end of the bar- there was no attempt made to assist or to offer anything to ease the sting of being slighted regarding the rez. As a restauranteur myself, I would have made certain to send a beverage immediately as we stood uncomfortably by the hostess stand. Ah well, I was in a great mood as were the rest of my brood so, we shrugged it off and continued on. Then they attempted to place us outside on the patio by the entrance on a very cold evening with my girls not at all dressed for the setting. I of course asked for a table inside(which I had requested per my initial Rez) and was finally given one next to (2) long tables with large parties. No big deal, we'll make do and enjoy the rest of the evening, right? But wait, they weren't done with us yet. The distracted waitress, either due to the amount of guests she had or the fact she thought her tip was already in jeopardy, brought us dishes we didn't order, saw to it that the table side guacamole we ordered for my little girl to enjoy wasn't prepared table side, seemed very irritated that we were even there. What's surprising is that she is the longest serving member of their staff so, perhaps she just had an off night. Meanwhile, I am doing my best to salvage the evening and just overlook all of this. But then and here's the best part, while the dishes are being tossed at us by food runners as previous dishes aren't cleared to make room, our drinks are empty and no one inquired as to another round and I'm sending items back we didn't ask for, the Manager walks over with the bar tab from earlier, has me sign it and then comes back to get the pen which had been placed on the wall behind us where the tab laid. You can't make this up. I honestly wasn't even going to leave this review because I feel the Owner/s really try to deliver a good product however, that said, someone has to be made aware of the truly dismissive and horrendous way we were treated. We will be back to give them another shot when we flow through Scottsdale on our way back from the Canyon. Hopefully then, they will see the value in ALL guests and handle things accordingly.",

Definitely splurged and ordered a ton of food including the duck carnitas empanada, grilled street corn, cordero tacos, papas y chorizo, and homemade guacamole.  It was a lot for 3 people, but we wanted to dabble on everything.  If I had to condense to the must haves it would be the duck carnitas empanada, cordero (lamb) tacos, and the guac that they make table side. The tacos came out in a skillet and you have to try both the flour and corn tortillas.  If I ever go back to Scottsdale, I would make a point to return.",

Sadly we didn't get to experience too much in the area, but very much to our liking we stumbled on this gem. I could have literally tried one of everything on the menu, but again because of lack of time our experience was slightly rushed. The table side guacamole and the tacos we had were out of this world, not to mention the cocktail list is outstanding!! I chose a beer that was rimed with salt and some lime juice.. making it like a margarita style beer. I wish we could have spent more time for pleasure and not so rushed for business. If business returns us this way, I will definitely return and make sure to try some other cocktails and appetizers, I recommend all my yelp friends so the same!!!  Cheers folks",

They have a few beers on tap(5-7) good enough for my ipa loving boyfriend. I myself am a tequila snob and they have the perfect Paloma! ( I have yet to find another as yummy!) Next up, table-side guacamole! They bring the guacamole cart to your table and ask your preference on spice and mix it all up. Again, best guacamole I have yet to taste.  Portion of guacamole could be a little bigger for price. We ordered the pork shoulder tacos which has a pineapple habanero glaze served with corn tortillas and serves two.   This is more of an upscale date night so be prepared pay a little more. Also, the lights are pretty dim so be prepared to pull your phone out for light if the candle isn't good enough. I thought it made our date very romantic and laid back. Can't wait to go back!",

Of course, the food is the star here. Albeit expensive, this is definitely elevated Mexican Food. I tried a kale salad with almonds and subbed in a date vinaigrette, and it was definitely one of the most memorable salads I've had! I also tried the brussel sprout tacos, which were exquisite.  And who doesn't like tableside prepared guacamole?! Everyone else in my party of seven enjoyed their meals... No complaints at all.   So you may be asking, why not five stars?  I think they may have over elevated here. The menu seemed a little bit inaccessible, especially since we had to look up many of the words in the dictionary. I'm really not looking for that in a Mexican restaurant. I don't mind paying more for high-quality food, but I don't need my Mexican food in a soubise sauce.  Yes, go look it up like my friend had to!",

The guacamole is fresh and compliments the salsa, though for $14 I wish we had gotten a bit more.   The steak tacos were awesome, but I was a bit disappointed with the house made chorizo - it is not the same chorizo that one would get in peninsular Spain.   The beer selection lacks decent craft options (only had one Anderson Valley beer when I dined there).   For dessert, get the espresso churros. Dip them in the milkshake. Leave extremely satisfied.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with some coworkers. We ordered all the appetizers the coworker recommended - the pork belly lettuce wrap, duck empanadas, and tostadas. The tostadas wasn't memorable. The pork belly was crispy and delicious. But the winner here is the duck empanadas. The empanadas was so crispy outside, almost like a thick egg roll skin. The filling was cheesy and the duck was tender. There was one piece of duck empanada left and the waiter took it awhile before I had the chance to take it. That was probably the lowest moment for me during dinner.   For my entree I got the duck confit. The duck was good but the sauce they used was kind of sweet which I wasn't a fan of. My coworker got the pork shoulder and he loved every bit of it.   For dessert I got the chocolate cake with ice cream. The cake had some kind of alcohol in it (I forgot what kind) and the alcohol was very apparent in the cake but it was still good. The cake had more of a mouse texture than an actual cake. The heaviness of the cake balanced out really well with the vanilla ice cream.   It's been about a week since I was here and I'm still thinking about those duck empanadas. When my friends asked me how my trip to Arizona was, I've been telling them I had the best duck empanadas here. Needless to say, you must get the duck empanadas. Get a few orders and eat it as your entree. You won't regret it.",

It was so dark inside, that was the only annoying aspect of eating there.  There were 5 of us and we shared a bunch of apps and one entree. We got crispy pork, duck empanadas.

We had eaten at the bar and the bartender was friendly and made good suggestions for food and drinks.  The service was great and the food was so fresh and flavorful!  The guacamole was our favorite!  Pure perfection!  We came back today and brought some friends with us this time. We talked so highly of this place and our friends were looking forward to trying this place out for themselves. We walked in at 4:40pm and we asked to eat outside in the patio.  The hostess told us they won't start serving dinner until 5:00pm, so we told her we would be back in 20 minutes after we checked out a store across the street.    When we came back the hostess recognized us and told us that she didn't have any outdoor seating after all. We we're surprised to hear that because if we would have known earlier we could have put our name for some indoor seating.  The hostess didn't seem to care that she told us the wrong information.  She made a feeble apology and did nothing at all to accommodate us. She then told us she didn't have anything available for another hour to and hour and a half and we could wait.  Seriously??  I don't understand how she could make a mistake giving us the wrong information.  Doesn't she check and understand the reservation lists before she starts opening her mouth and giving customers information?    I felt bad for my friends because we really hyped up this place. Not only did this experience spoil it for our friends, it made me disgusted seeing first hand how this hostess represented this restaurant.  I guess this restaurant doesn't care to hire the appropriate staff and do the proper training in order to keep their customers coming back to their establishment.  Such a shame.",

I'm not sure where I had heard the rumors but for whatever reason, it was stuck in my head that The Mission was a \"couple-y\" place to go. Being the \"single-y\" person that I am, I had put going to this particular place off for quite some time even though it had been REALLY high on my list. I had met one of the owners many years ago at the bar of another one of my favorite places, and when he described it to me, I'd wanted to go ever since...I'm sad I waited so long because this place was absolutely phenomenal. I went with Another friend who'd been before and she suggested we make a reservation the evening prior, and I thought to myself at the time, \"how silly, we won't need a reservation at 6 PM on a Monday!\"  Boy was I ever wrong, and happy to be proven so!!  This place was packed to capacity the entire night we were there, and people dejectedly walked to other, less amazing eateries over and over that night. The bar was also filled with a mix of both coupled and uncoupled people, mostly business types it appeared. But onto more important things, such as the food.   Everything from the presentation to the flavor to the temperature to the service to the drinks to the portions to the decor to the menu selection to the manager stopping by multiple times was impeccable. This was one of those unexpectedly delightful experiences that I thought would just be another washed up has-been that I am delighted to say I can now add to my \"must try\" list for out of towners. I absolutely cannot wait to go back, if there's anything I'm a sucker for it's a unique dessert, and the mini churros with the frozen chocolate knocked it out of the park.",

    "text": "We were craving a tasty and satisfying meal after eating sandwiches all week. After searching yelp, we decided on this place based on the reviews, and we like Scottsdale. The Mission Old Town was exactly what we were looking for. It isn't your typical Mexican restaurant, it's better.   I'd recommend making a reservation, and if there are none available, get there before 5 and put your name down. They have tasty drinks and starters to hold you over until your table is ready.   Based on yelp reviews and the waitress' recommendations, we ordered:   - strawberry banana margarita  - aguacate margarita  - tableside guacamole  - grilled street corn - chorizo porchetta - green chile duck confit   We were told that the duck and pork were their specialty, and boy were they good! I'd highly recommend everything we ordered. The flavors were perfectly blended, and so memorable. We decided to order the avocado margarita based on the waitress' recommendation, and it was good! It had a different taste than any other margarita I've had. Yum!   The guacamole is made at your table (thus the name), and that means you get to pick your level of spice as well as the ingredients. So fresh!   The street corn is so tasty, but a little spicy and more on the heavier side. Definitely worth a try though. I've never had anything like it.   The duck was \"fall off the bone\", and the mole sauce was amazing! Nutty, and flavorful, it mixed perfectly with the flavors of the meat.   The pork wasn't fatty (major plus!) and very flavorful. It was tender - perfectly cooked. The sauce hit it home. So good!   Make sure to order corn tortillas with the entree dishes. They just add to the deliciousness, and are plated on a salt block. They are small though, so you'll probably need to order a second round, like we did!  If I'm ever back in Scottsdale, Mission Old Town is a must! The servers are knowledgeable, friendly, and make awesome recommendations!",

We asked for extra spicy and it fit the bill. We ordered family style of various tacos and I didn't have anything I didn't like. The Duck was great! Spicy margs could use some more spice but the mezcal drink was great.",

The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great for our larger group. All service staff were super attentive and gracious. The table-side guacamole & roasted corn appetizer were to die for. I will definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Scottsdale and hope to dine here again in the future. Thank you for a wonderful evening!",

    "text": "Had a business dinner and chose The Mission. Had been there twice before. Made a reservation for 6pm and to sit outside.  Arrived at 5:55. It went down hill from there  Hostess told me we could not be seated for outside unless we waited for 45 minutes.  (Back area is nice, however they were hosting an event) The hostess then suggested not getting what I was promised and sitting outside was my fault  as I needed to make my reservation further in advance (HUH?) . I asked to speak to the manager . A guy came out of somewhere (a rent-a-manager perhaps) who did not really even apologize for anything, I suppose his role was be the bad cop and say  \"tough - The Mission's problem is now on you the Customer and its your  problem\".  So, then my dilemma , do we sit in a noisy area for a business meeting... OR wait at THE MISSION for 45 minutes OR  go somewhere else and wait.   My business associates and I opted for the noisy inside seating. Yes it was noisy, yes it was hard to hold a 3 way conversation.   There was a bright side. I told the waitress how wrong we had been treated. SHE was empathetic, SHE apologized (finally) and SHE was delightful.  The food:  great sounding menu and presentation is good. Quality of food, better than average. One of my associates is a \"foody\" and he had a few comments about flavor combinations and thought the ice cream in his \"Mexican chocolate\" dessert had melted and then had  been refrozen as \"there were crystal's in it\".   He is clearly a level beyond my food tastes. My scallops ... presentation very nice, quality, what I would expect from a good restaurant, not \"over the top\".   Price- yes I paid a premium to have a table that was not what I was promised and did not allow me to hold the business dinner conversation I was trying to have. I would say you pay for the atmosphere a bit and for being in Old Scottsdale, however, clearly the atmosphere sitting the main Inside Area- sub par.   Advice- choose wisely. This place may not be where you want  to go during Baseball Spring Training or anytime when they have a crowd.",

The guacamole app and pork app were well done, but the wings had a better write up then the small, skinny BWW leftovers they were. The entrees will fill you up, though they look small when plated. The pork tacos for two is a great deal - a lot of food and a fun warming stone keeps the tortillas warm. Service was better than decent, but they wanted that table turned on Friday night something fierce.   I'd return for sure. Maybe not next trip, but I'd recommend to others easily.",

    "text": "For some reason it took me a long time to try The Mission.    Well, don't be like us - Go Now! The Mission is great and not at all what I expected (in a good way). By looking at the menu online I thought this was going to be a stuffy, overpriced, quiet, boring \"Upscale Mexican\" restaurant OR a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale with great decor and awful food- wrong!   First of all, unlike so many places in the Valley, The Mission is a standalone building (aka you're not in a strip mall or shopping center. There's a quaint front patio with an over sized fireplace. Then, you walk inside to a dark, chandelier (lots of them) lit bar area and restaurant. The bar was packed, the music was turned up loud and the vibe was great. We were happy to wait for a table because we got to spend some time looking around inside and enjoying the bar. Unbeknownst to us, the restaurant didn't stop there. We were escorted to the adorable back patio covered with lights, a fountain and screened in by tall green trees. I give the vibe and decor two thumbs up.   So what about the food? So good! As recommended by everyone on Yelp, we did the table-side guacamole and it didn't disappoint. My husband and his dad ordered the pulled pork tacos that included 10 small tortillas on a salt brick to keep them warm - so cool - and all the fixings. They loved them. I had the fish tacos which was absolutely delicious. Don't be fooled by the small portions - the flavors are big and after chips, salsa and guacamole you're perfectly content.   This restaurant is a great spot for just about anything... a date night, girls night out, dinner with parents, out of town visitors, clients...  We'll absolutely be back.",

And The Mission met my high expectations! The atmosphere is really romantic but fun at the same time, I would be just as comfortable there on a date as I would be with some girlfriends. The bartenders were all really nice and the pear basil margarita was amazing. So was the white sangria. I may have been a bit toasted by the time I left. But that's not a bad thing.  And the food was delicious. We had the chips and guac, and the guac was great - nice spice level where it heated me up but didn't set my mouth on fire. Very nice mix of herbs. The chips were maybe a hair greasy for my taste but that is my only complaint. I had the duck confit which was absolutely delicious, and a huge portion. My friend had the black cod which we agreed was the better dish. It was light, flavorful, just perfect. We split the espresso churros for dessert and they were freaking incredible. I could have taken a bath in the milkshake thing they came with.  Overall The Mission is highly recommended. Go there!",

So overall I say 3.5 stars for my experience, but i can certainly see a 4 and 5 star review for this place.    The table side guacamole was incredible...some of the best I've had.   I would say its a must-get every time you go.   Instead of ordering an entree I ordered two appetizers for my dinner.  The reason I did this is because I had these two apps suggested to me by several people - the pork belly pibil and the crispy cola pork.  As you can see, thats a lot of pork belly.  I ate the crispy cola pork first, and it was very tasty.  It was quite sweet from the cola, but it was a nice app.  I probably only ate 1/3 of the pork belly pibil, but like i said, I think i was just overwhelmed with pork belly.  It was a pretty big block of pork too, maybe enough for a meal in itself.  It was tasty as well, but certainly more fatty than its crispy counterpart.   You can take my review for what its worth.  I'd say everything I got was worth getting again, but maybe just not all together.",

It had gotten good reviews and I was looking forward to trying something new close to our neighborhood.  We were going to sit inside, but the music was so loud we decided to try the patio.  It was a nice setting with a great fireplace, but again, the music was very loud and it was difficult to talk.  The server was friendly, but after asking her for recommendations, she admitted it was her first brunch and she did not know the menu.  I ordered Huevos Rancheros and a Bloody Mary and my husband ordered the Green (Pork) Chilaquiles and a Vodka and Tonic.  The server did not write it down and brought the Red (Chicken) Chilaquiles instead of the Green.  Husband doesn't like chicken, so I ate my dish while he waited for them to make his.  The food was good, but not exceptional.  The server knew it was my birthday, but nothing special was said or offered.  When the bill came, it was wrong.  Bloody Marys and Mimosas are half-price at brunch and we were charged full-price.  I wanted to love the place but I don't think we'll go back.",

I almost left my keys in the restaurant because they fell out of my jacket pocket and I couldn't see anything around me.The owners and the manager seem perfectly happy sacrificing customer comfort for a semblance of \"ambiance,\" (the bar area remained much brighter than the dining area, which makes one think maybe they are afraid of customers actually seeing their food!) and the wait staff can't/won't do anything about it.

My favorite thing on the menu *Grilled street corn: bueno, but not quite as good as the street grilled variety in Mexico  *Lamb rib appetizer- fatty and not too much meat...but the good bits we're awesome! *Mahi Mahi tacos- decent, but save the fish tacos for another time and place! *Espresso churros & milkshake- a tasty and fun dessert...couldn't taste the espresso, but it was fun to dip those crunchy morsels!  Our server was also very knowledgeable - will definitely be returning to the Mission!",

Then, my girlfriend went to the bathroom and saw the hostess crying because her manager was yelling at her for not seating our table fast enough. Really weird experience.

    "text": "I was blown away by the food and service at The Mission.   Our group was split into 2 groups of 8 and my table ordered a few guacamole and Street corn appetizers.   The table-side guacamole was unique and fun. I am a guacamole snob and will say that while it wasn't the best i have had...i was still impressed with the whole presentation and diverse flavours.  The street corn was ridiculously/ dangerously delicious. Just leave me in a room with a shovel and a barrel of street corn and I will be a happy person. Fresh, rich, sweet, savoury...everything you would want.  I ordered the Duck confit and was not disappointed. Where the hell has \"cheesy fried hominy\" been all my life? The richness of the confit and mole was perfectly counter-balanced by the fresh radish/ apple salad on the plate.  The only thing that trumped the food in my eyes was the service we received from our server Crystal. As mentioned, my table was half of a group of 16 guys (Bachelor party weekend). From experience, tables of this size and demographic on a busy night are usually forgotten about and lacking in the attentiveness department (especially considering the auto-gratuity). But this was not the case with Crystal. She offered some of the best service I have ever experienced in a group setting. Friendly, attentive, patient, and prompt.   The way our meal ended will forever be the benchmark of 4-star class service for my future dining experiences. Instead of simply dropping off one single bill of $1500+ plus auto gratuity for us 8 guys to try and split, Crystal did something I have never experienced. Without asking, she split our bill by 8 without any mistakes...not only that she even split our appetizers by 8. The BEST part? NO AUTO GRATUITY! I was blown away! This, along with everything else that had transpired lead me to leave a tip that was much larger than the auto gratuity of 18%.  An incredible Mexican restaurant with high-end flavours and service!",

Our companion did not get hers and we all waited for it to come and we waited and we waited...  Finally I motioned the manager over and explained the situation.  He was very apologetic and ran to go get the dish that was obviously lukewarm and had been waiting in the kitchen.  He was very solicitous and said that he would be right back to check that everything was ok, but he never returned.

We got the tableside guacamole which was great. We also shared the grilled street corn which was nicely topped with a spicy cream/cheese sauce. I had steak tacos and wife had chicken tacos. Small tortillas but stacked with a good amount of the meat/fish of choice.  Can sit out on the pato or inside which is nicely done in wood and dark tones. Service was very efficient and attentive. My only complaint was the table for 2 is too small. Having chips and guac leaves little room for other plates. Dessert menu could be improved. We had the fried banana and it was okay but enjoyed the cinammon gelato. Prices a little high but on avg for Old Town. Will definitely return for the guac and tacos!",

Part man -part titan, Matt Carter wields his otherworldly craft above all who stand before him, casting a shadow upon the culinary world. It is in the town of Scottsdale where you will find this man; working his magic - constantly revealing new cuisine and enlightening the pallets of those willing to take a pilgrimage. In his sanctuary, Matt Carter brings a taste of Mount Olympus to Prometheus' beloved creation.  By divine twist of fate I stumbled upon The Mission, Matt Carter's take on Latin cuisine. Having conquered dishes the world over, Carter set out on a quest to create the Latin experience in the Heart of Scottsdale, Arizona with a smashing success. Offering a variety of traditional food including Pozole (Mexico) and Anticuchos (Peru) one can literally travel Latin America in one restaurant. From Swordfish Veracruz to the Grilled Sweet Corn, and Braised Shortrib to the splendid array of tacos; The Mission's menu is one of shear cunning and beauty. Each dish is eloquently decorated to match the rich artistic heritage of our neighbors to the south, and carries with them an exquisite flavor leaving you yearning for more. Complimented with a drink selection that not only arouse the curiosity but accommodates those seeking their exotic escape, The Mission creates an experience all will remember.  To complete this unique tour of Latin America, The Mission takes you there with its authentic decor. To bask in the atmosphere of romance is what a trip to this restaurant  will provide. Its rustic ambiance whisks you away to a land rich in culture and decadence. It will truly show you the splendor of our American brothers and sisters.

A skewer of corn with butter, chile paprika and cotija. Its spicy and just the right amount of food for a starter.  2- Guacamole: they make it for you right at your table! You can choose how spicy you want it and can tell your guac mixer to skip the onions. :)  And last but not least... 3- Roasted Organic Butternut squash Taco's: Spicy black bean sofrito, cumin, coriander+poblano, pickled jalapeno+cotija. These are easily the most delicious vegetarian taco's I have ever had. Delicious and again, not over board on the portions.  To drink? we ordered the Bitter Bee's. Hendricks gin, lime, basil, AZ honey and grapefruit. I could tell instantly how fresh the grapefruit juice was. If t wasn't squeezed you fooled me!   We skipped dessert because with all this goodness we were pretty full. We made a reservation for two outside around 5:45pm and had zero issues getting seated as soon as we arrived. We sat at the back patio and while the atmosphere was dimly lit and beautiful for a cozy NYE meal, there was a funky smell coming from, what we guessed, their water fountain. Slowly we became desensitized to the smell and once the food was there, we didn't really notice much else going on around us. Service was great and I can't wait to go back there again.",

My sister ordered Chorizo Porchetta which was pork shoulder with fresh kitchen made chorizo stuffed in the middle and I ordered the Chilean Salmon.  The drinks were amazing.  We ended dinner with Espresso Churros....oh my...no words.  I will never have Churros unless they are from The Mission way in Scottsdale AZ.",

Tempting menu with plenty of items to share? Check, check, check.   I'm a huge fan of tableside guac, and the Mission whipped up a batch just to my liking (maybe less so to my friends at the table.) I'm not a fan of tomatoes with my avo, but feel free to load up on the garlic, onion, cayenne and anything that's extra hot. Yum! I could have made a meal on the freshly-made guac, crispy-thin chips and smoky-flavored salsa alone.  We were lucky enough to sample a tasting menu, which is how I prefer to eat at restaurants like this where it's easy to be overwhelmed by all the delicious-sounding options. For the life of me, I can't remember every single item we tried, but the pork tacos were a standout and I loved the presentation of the extra tortillas on a salt block. As expected, they have a huge variety of tequilas to choose from, and the margs, caprihinas and mojitos all have an twist. Try the pineapple ginger mojito - it's just as flavorful as it sounds. And the milkshake with churro dessert. You will not be disappointed!",

I had:  - Tableside Guacamole: Rather overpriced at $12 for 1 avocado's worth of mush but perfectly delicious. Everything tastes very fresh and it had the prefect amount of citrus, garlic, cilantro, and spice.  - Butternut Squash Tacos: Yummy! I was nervous that the squash would be too sweet but the flavors ended up working very well together and it was a satisfying savory dish. This is the only vegetarian entree, but I don't think vegetarians suffer with this delicious dish. It isn't all that big so definitely order an appetizer or additional side. - White Bean Puree: Super delicious and kind of like an awesome mexican take on hummus.  - Espresso Churros with Milkshake: Awesome dessert. I hate coffee flavored desserts and thankfully this one didn't taste a thing like espresso. The churros are warm and soft and taste good on their own or paired with the milkshake. The milkshake is basically a vanilla version of mexican hot chocolate with strong notes of cinnamon and other spices.  I definitely recommend the Mission as a place to bring a date, your girlfriends, your parents, basically anyone you like.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying the atmosphere, food and cocktails are fabulous.   My one star rating is due to the poor judgment of management and customer service.  Which for me makes or brakes a place.   I had hear a lot of great things about The Mission, so a friend and I finally decided to give it a try.  It was a Friday night, the place was packed, we decided to sit at the bar, have a drink and order some appetizers.  While sitting there another single woman at the bar started talking to us along with 2 couples that were waiting to be seated for dinner.  So the group of newly found friends (7 total), all started talking, laughing and enjoying ourselves.   Just a side note, there was a TV on in the bar, with a football game, music (current upbeat) being piped in through the bar and restaurant, the crowd was about at an average decimal level for a Friday evening, packed place with a TV and music in the background. After laughing at one of the many topics of conversation that our new friends brought to the table, the bartender came over to our group and gave us a \"shhhh\" using his hands in a \"lower the volume\" motion.   I asked \"did someone complain about us being to loud\" (I was shocked)  he motioned over to his manager, who about a half hour earlier came over to welcome us and we raved to him about the food and atmosphere.   Another side note, I am a 49 year old woman, raised well, from Scottsdale, have been in the service industry and know how to \"behave\" in an establishment. I was so insulted, as were our other new friends, we all asked for our bills and cashed out, to the bartenders surprise. As I was leaving, I asked to see the Manger, Tom is his name.  He came over, I asked if any of the patrons had complained about the volume of our conversation, he said \"no but several were looking your way as you were all laughing\"......   REALLY?!!!!! Not only did I explain that he made a very poor choice in having the bartender do his dirty work and ask us to lower our voices, but the fact that no one complained, and that the restaurant was loud and as I looked around the majority of the patrons were laughing and having a good time, gave me cause to believe that he had no right to embarrass us as he did.   Tom never apologized, got very defensive and rude to both myself and my friend.  I will admit that there may have been 30 seconds to 1 minute when 7 people were laughing and clapping hands at the topic of conversation, but in no way were we causing a scene or making spectacle of ourselves. I hope Tom and the owner of The Mission read this review and remember the old saying \"a happy patron will tell 3 people, an unhappy patron will tell dozens\"...... DONE!!!!!!!",

Literally the pork just shred off so easily then I order some sort of salmon dish which I thought was unique. Unique in a very good way. There were certain ingredients that I never thought would pair well but this dish was very nicely done. Then the side of \"MISSION FRIES\" omg maybe I should of not order these because the size was just insane. But glad I did since the taste was even better.  All in all, I definitely come back here again. Everyone was very friendly that when I made the reservations they asked if it was a occasion and I told them it was a birthday dinner, when the time came to order desserts, no I didn't get the churros because as a birthday \"cake\" they served some sort of pumpkin cake with ice cream and pomragrated seeds on top that was just O.M.F.G. I need to find out the name of that dish it was TO DIE FOR.",

I particularly liked the fact that it isn't limited to a particular country and incorporates dishes from a variety of Latin American countries.   I came for lunch so I'm unsure of how the dinner menu plays out.    For lunch,  I started with the cheese plate.  They give you one cheese,  a huge piece, but you can get others for some more money.  In addition to the cheese you get serrano ham, chorizo, a green spicy sauce, apple, Chilean honey, bread and maybe some other stuff I can't recall.  The honey was amazing!  The cheese, Neyat I think,  was a legit cheese.  I also had the chicken arepas.  It is essentially a bunch of awesome stuff, chicken, onions, some sauce...etc on a corn based bread.  Excellent.  And that, my friends, is what I thought of The Mission.",

I celebrated my birthday here with some girlfriends and we had a fantastic time.  While I don't drink (not court or rehab mandated either) my friends raved about the Premarita Margarita, their signature drink made with Partida tequila and agave nectar.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the guacamole which is made tableside.  Since some of the ladies prefer their guac a bit spicier than the others, our server was happy to accomodate our requests.  I had the chicken tacos which were the perfect size for me.  I think that a man may look at the 3 small tacos on my plate and wonder what else was for dinner but for me it was perfect.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a delicious flavor that just spicy enough without searing my tastebuds off.    For desert, my friend made me a home-made birthday cake that she brought in and for a small cake-cutting fee, was presented to me (with trick candles and sparklers no less!)  The service that we had was top notch.  Brian, the owner, made sure that we were taken care of and helped to make the evening special.  The bartender and server were both attentive, quick, and friendly.  All in all, it was a wonderful birthday dinner.  I have never had a bad experience at The Mission and can't wait to return.",

I am a big fan of tapas, but tapas are $8 not $12. No happy hour is a deterent as there is no house wine and the wines by the glass start at $9 for anything drinkable. Great pork belly and 7 spice soup, but I have to say no to a $12 Arepa (Argentine cornmeal sandwich) it's a sandwich. Sexy Atmosphere Yes! But there are too many closed restaurants in Scottsdale to rely on atmosphere and high prices.",

We had the mission margarita, and a sample taste of the frozen mint lemonade margarita, fabulous! Hubby had the clam stew, which he said was fabulous. I had the pork shoulder tacos with pineapple ended cilantro, beautiful presentation and pleasing to the palette. Sam, our waiter, was top notch, made great recommendations and offered exceptional service. We went at 4:30 pm and were seated immediately and the afternoon menu still available.  Trusting Sam with the desert selection, it was fabulous!  Pumpkin bread pudding with pomegranate seeds and toasted pumpkin seeds with a rum sauce, Amazing!  This was one of the highlights of our trips",

    "text": "Having Christmas Eve dinner with friends, we started with drinks and the fantastic guacamole with chips. As we filled up on chips, we joked that maybe we should have just stopped there and not ordered dinner. Little did we know how right we were going to be.   We went the tapas route rather than entrees. We ordered...   Duck carnitas empanada: The shell was tough, not tender and crunchy as it should have been. It also had a very distinct lemon flavor, which was ok, but a little odd. Otherwise, the duck filling was good.   Roast Corn Gorditas: The little silver dollar size gorditas were, again, tough. Almost inedible. Neither the amount nor the flavor of the topping was enough to overshadow this problem.   Shrimp Anticuchos: Waaaaaay over cooked. I knew before I bit into it, too. I tried to remove the remaining shell from the tail and the shrimp didn't pull out of it - too dry.   Chicken Anticuchos: Dry and over cooked. Good flavors, though.   Beef Anticuchos: This one bright spot for the tapas dishes arrived very late. Hot, juicy, and amazing flavors. But... and this is a big one... The runner who brought it made a point of saying that the kitchen had 'run out' of these and had to make this one fresh. Um, what? Does that explain the other 4 dishes and their awful execution? We just happened to get a bunch of stuff that was pre-prepared and sitting around? Suddenly it all made sense.   By the time we finished the beef, we were done but not full or satisfied (obviously). We headed off to Grand Luxe (not that many places to go on Christmas Eve, really) and were happier there with a few tapas dishes and dessert.   And a note for servers: When you ask if everything is ok and everyone chuckles sadistically rather than answer, when you don't follow up, it's obvious you don't care.  In the end, other than the very late dish, service was pretty good. Drinks were good. Chips and guac were excellent. It just felt like the B team was in the kitchen so that the real cooks/chefs could be home for Christmas Eve. So much potential, but so little execution.",

Expectations were set to pick up the order in 10-15 minutes at the bar.  Not a terrible estimate. Arriving 25 minutes after ordering I found the bar at sold out to the lovely Shae. Every seat was filled. Every employee that I interacted with was great!  Even while on hold placing the order. I was tended to several times with an update as to when my order would be taken. FOOD, let's get to the food. The Butternut Squash Tacos were the most petite little things. Seemingly small portioned these tacos were satisfying. The squash was perfectly cooked and there was a blend of black beans and sun flower seed to lend some protein. The guacamole was unique with Parmesan, sun flowers and a bit of smoke. The salsa was also an Arbol smoky.  The HEAT challenged my mojo. I thought I wanted a 7 out of 10 kind of heat. They gave me mild with a side of the pure goodness. The smoke definitely comes from the hot sauce. It's a heat that build for a few seconds and lights on fire when you try to wash it down. MEDIUM was plenty.   The Pumpkin Bread Pudding was all the reviews promised.",

The setting could be called warm and romantic and the main attraction is the patio, which is hard to secure, so you will end up sitting in the loud inside area.  I am not sure why the place is so popular. If you call, they are usually fully booked, but if you just walk in, there is a big chance you would be seated within 10 minutes.  The decor is a mix of Latin and American steakhouse and doesn't have a unique identity in my opinion. It would definitely need a makeover to stay popular, given all the cool places that are popping up in the old town. As for the food; I have been there three times already and the experience has always been average. Based on my last experience, I don't think I would go back. Most of our hot appetizers came late and cold. The taco dishes were mediocre and there were not enough staff to attend to our demanding party.",

    "text": "The Mission is in Old Scottsdale, a nice area for good restaurants and shopping.    We went on a Sunday early afternoon for brunch.  It was busy but we were able to find a table in the bar area (first come, first served).  Otherwise, if you want a table, I'd suggest making reservations (we had one for dinner originally and times went quickly...we called a week in advance and the best we could get was 6PM).  Brunch is a choice of the regular menu, which is small but has some good dishes, or an All-You-Can-Eat taco bar, which is done well.  They have someone carving beef and pork.  They put it on a small, soft tortilla for you, and you add your own toppings.  Very good, reasonable price (think it was $16).  They also offer table side Guacamole, made to your preferences.  Overall, very enjoyable.  Might give it a 5-star if it were in another location, but with the competition in that area, there are a few that are slightly better.",

Great traditional margaritas or try the blood orange if you are looking for something different.",

You can tell they take their cooking seriously. I would go back, but it's probably not one of my regular spots.

They were very busy (spring training etc) so the waitress was kind enough to give us a complimentary table-side guacamole for the wait, and it was friggin' delicious. They're guacamole magicians at this place, or maybe it's just that it's really fresh - either way, get the guacamole. As for entrees, I had the Red Chilaquiles, and my wife had the Mission Huevo Ranchero with red chile pork added. Both were incredibly enjoyable - the fried tortillas on the chilaquiles were perfect, crisp but you could still cut through them and eat them with a fork, and I could have eaten a big plate of red chile pork all by itself it was so tasty. Highly recommended.",

I had the Florida grouper, which was incredible. Perfectly cooked, and the sauce on top is great. It came with a side of quinoa that was crunchy, I have never had it that way but I loved it. My friend had the duck confit, which was also amazing. I had a bit of it, and it tasted like chicken and waffles. So whatever they are doing, they are doing it right. I had the pumpkin bread pudding that was pretty good, the only recommendation would be to make the outside and specifically the edges more crispy. This one was soft all over and what I love about bread pudding is the crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.",

I shared the chorizo porchetta. TO DIE FOR. Everyone loved their tacos which were recommended by our server. We had a small incident involving one of our drinks, but both our server and the manager/gm/owner (?) went above and beyond to make up for it. Not only did the manager apologize, but he also brought out a round of delicious tequila for myself and 9 guests which everyone loved. If that was not enough, our server brought us (I'm pretty sure) every dessert they have on the menu. Both the tequila and 6 desserts were comped. I'm so incredibly impressed by our service here. They made my birthday dinner so special. I will definitely be back and recommend this place.",

Service was the worst part of our experience.  It appeared as though our server was relatively new as she kept referring to notes on wines and food and then got upset with us when she brought us a sparkling wine when we had ordered the still. She was really huffy thinking we were being difficult and took the wine away and when she came back she had the wine list open and was like, \"oh, there is a still of the rose, I thought it only came in sparkling.  All roses are usually sparkling.\"  Um...no.     My friend enjoyed her margarita but you won't find us back here.  I would be willing to overlook the wine mix-up if the food made it worth it.",

From the drunk Texan wearing the crayola- crayon inspired button down waving his hands in front of my wife's phone like a tool while she waited to be seated, to the lackluster guac that did not have much taste.  For the price of the meal, I was disappointed.  The best thing that we had was Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze, which was served in a lettuce wrap.  That was tasty, so were the Pork Shoulder tacos.    The biggest disappointment was the Pork Shoulder entre, which arrived with a tiny bowl of white bean puree.  The pork shoulder was lacking flavor and even more disheartening it was served so bare - just a big hunk of meat on a plate.  I wish I took a picture.   I would recommend sticking with the tacos at this place.   Crayola Crayon shirt guy probably thinks the drinks are good, too.",

Beautifully cooked and seasoned, piled on top of the fresh tortillas. Yikes. I wasn't that hungry after the guac but had no problem happily eating these. I like them just as much as the pork tacos and its just the right amount of food.   We had coffee - yum to the french press - alongside of which was a cinnamon shortbread that had some pepper heat. Perfect. The table shared churros. I love you Mission, but the churros were meh. A bit overcooked and it seemed like the oil in the fryer need to change. Its a nit pick, granted. Otherwise, it was a full house, service was humming and dinner was great. Still a fan.",

    "text": "Being a visitor to a new place, I tend to lean on yelp to guide my dining decisions. So, when I see The Mission rated as the best spot in Oldtown Scottsdale, the bar is set fairly high. Unfortunately, my overall impression left me feeling disappointed and underfed.   As a solo patron, I don't expect the wait staff to prioritize me, but the service staff didn't even acknowledge me for the first 15 minutes after I was promptly seated by the host. No water. No head nod. Nothing.   I had plenty of time to peruse the menu and settled on the skirt steak tacos. When my waiter finally arrived, he was professional, but brief. I made my order and the food arrived shortly after - maybe 10 minutes.   The tacos come in threes. 3 tacos - each about 3 inches in diameter. They were quite good and the skirt steak had a wonderful smoke fired / grilled flavor that left my mouth watering. Not bad if this was an a la carte menu. However, either it was unclear in the menu that these tacos come with no sides or my waiter did a poor job by not advising me of this otherwise anemic meal.  The average person could have easily eaten 6-10 of these tacos by themselves, but would have otherwise needed at least one side to fill up.   Ultimately, I was failed by the menu and the waitstaff for what would have otherwise been a pleasurable dining experience.  I look forward to coming back again, but next time asking more questions before ordering.",

The restaurant is in a great location, which I think plays a huge role in its allure. It appears to be clean.   Service is just OK. Food came out quick and we were able to pay and leave very quickly at the end of our meal. Drink refills never really happened, and I have only went on nights that were not particularly busy.   When it comes to food, I feel the restaurant doesn't live up to the hype. Let me start off by saying that The Mission does offer many unique dishes, such as a duck confeit. I commend them for that. However, when it comes to taste, it's not anything special. There are too many other great local competitors that specialize in Mexican cuisine, especially in the Old Town area.  For example, what is supposed to be a spicy guacamole is actually quite bland. Most proteins are excessively salted. With portion sizes being somewhat on the smaller side, I had high expectations for the taste and texture of food, but there really was nothing to set The Mission above other options.   Worth a try just to say you have eaten here. Otherwise, I would rather just go to Bandera down the street. They have excellent Southwestern food (the ribs are particularly exceptional). If you're craving Mexican, head over to Barrio Queen which is on the north west side of Old Town.",

We arrived to the restaurant around 2:30 and were greeted by a hostess who was on her phone texting and because of that we had to repeat ourselves 3 times and she still got our party size wrong.  We had to wait over 15 mins to get a high chair and to have a server come to take our drink order. Once we had got our drinks it was 2:48 and were then told we could not order off the lunch menu and could only order of a \"afternoon menu,\" when the waitress was questioned on if we could order the pork shoulder tacos, which were on the lunch menu but not the \"afternoon\" menu she became very rude and said no as the lunch menu ended at 2:45 (the website says 3pm). When questioned about waiting to get our table sorted out with highchairs and her not coming to take our order she just said it not her fault and there wasn't anything she could do but she would cash out of drink and we were welcome to leave. I wish we took her up on her invitation as the service didn't get any better. This experience was tough as we enjoyed our food but the service was horrible, with a distracted and unfriendly hostess, to a server who was slow and very rude to everyone at our table, Kids included. We were never asked by a server or a manger about our meal or experience.",

You are actually inside a converted church, so the remains of the wooden ceiling beams and high structure were preserved. There was minimal decorations, but that just served to enhance the ambience. The red glowing light of the bar area and the candles on the table are really the only source of light in the restaurant. Perfect spot for a sexy date night.  Starting from the very beginning, the complementary tortillas were fresh and crisp and our drinks were strong. We asked for medium spice level with our shared guacamole appetizer but should have gone up to the next level (wasn't too spicy). The restaurant also serves a REALLY strong ghost pepper sauce if you want a legit kick to your meal. I wasn't too hungry so I can only comment on the shaved kale salad and the grilled street corn side which I had as my entree. The kale salad was standard- nothing extraordinary. However, the corn was impeccable. Sweet yet spicy. I could have had a few more orders! My girlfriend also recommended the flatiron steak which was juicy and cooked to perfection.  If you are in Scottsdale, would definitely recommend you stop in- the hype is real! Make reservations early (I made mine over a month in advance) as they are very popular.",

From a food perspective the Mission really delivers.   From a service level it has a long ways to go... from a very poor seating experience to a very delayed table side service experience that was topped off by waiting forever for tacos and a Kobe Dog ?  Geez.",

Now I don't mind paying that much for lunch, but the portions were PATHETIC.  The seafood soup, advertised as having shrimp clams and sausage came in a tiny container that was only half full AND NO SHRIMP, very few clams, mainly sausage, which if it had been advertised as a sausage soup would have been a little more acceptable.  $14 for that tiny shot of soup, by the way.  The posole was a little heartier, but again, a tiny half filled container for $10.00!  Same with the honey chipotle grits.  They barely covered the bottom of the miniscule container they were in.  To be fair, the flavors were good, but ZERO stars for value and $50.00 later,  I'm still hungry!",

Ok I expected like street sized tacos but these were like the aborted stem cells found in a bathroom stall at a street taco junior prom! I mean ok..they were tasty, but nowhere near worth the price! They didn't even come with any sides.. just these 3 fetus tacos and a wedge of lime! Then I remembered something.. I haven't spent any time in SCOTTSDALE since I got hijacked a few years back at a bar where it was $9 shot night! I forgot how overrated this whole area of town is. If I wasn't trying to bang the chick I was with, I would have walked the fck out. Won't be back.   Bye Felicia!",

There was an unusually cold breeze coming through, that affected part of the group and caused a cold windy chill for them. It was a beautiful setting outside and the birds were chirping, but the cold weather became too much; so they politely offered to move us.  The rest of the dinner was much more fun and comfortable. Katie our server was knowledgeable and fun and caring. Highly recommend her!  The menu is interesting Latin American fusion and we had red wine and avocado margaritas for drinks and 4 of us had the most amazing duck confit tacos- best I have ever had-- and also a skirt steak taco and mahi mahi taco --along with sides of their corn and black and white beans as well as \"made at table\" guacamole. The mix of spice flavors was wonderful! The restaurant was packed and you could easily see why it has been successful for 10 years!",

I popped in yesterday for a sangria and some table side guacamole which both were always amazing in the past. This time was different. The sangria was horrific and the table side guacamole had very little flavor and was made with a less than ripe avocado. What's normally smooth and creamy is now chunky and tasteless. Now the Mission is like most Scottsdale restaurants - spot on with atmosphere and mediocre with food.   Consistency breeds success....inconsistency closes doors.   Not sure I'll return.",

But of course, one of the main reasons we came to the restaurant was because of the 4 star rating.  My husband and I always prefer to sit at the bar especially when we're out of town. We showed up before the busy time and there were still spots at the bar. You know how you can sense when someone is just not interested in you or simply have no interest in talking to you?  This pretty much sums up the bartender's attitude towards us.  We first asked if they had any specials going on and basically told us they did not.  Again basically with an attitude of \"I don't really want to talk to you\" or \"Can you order your drink already so I can be done with you.\"  Since we we're already there we ordered one drink and left.",

    "text": "Came to The Mission recently for our company holiday party and had an amazing experience. From the ambiance to the service to the food, everything was top notch. I was the first to arrive in our party of six. We had a reservation on a very busy Sunday evening and the table was ready and waiting for us in the back of the restaurant. I was greeted right away by our waiter. He came over and took my drink order and brought it out very quickly.  I was able to have a good look at the menu before the rest of the party arrived and good thing that I did because everything looked and sounded so good. When the rest of my party arrived, we decided to get table side guacamole and it was very fresh and delicious. I decided on the short rib tacos and a side of street corn for my entree and both were extremely good. The short rib was melt in your mouth good and the three tacos were perfectly sized. The street corn was served in a spicy chipolte sauce and I could have eaten it for days. I also asked if they had a spicer salsa and our waiter said that he could bring me out a sauce made with ghost chile. I went for it because I LOVE spicy. I knew to use it sparingly and it gave me the zip I was looking for to both my corn and tacos. Two of the people in my party were vegetarians and ordered the butternut squash tacos and absolutely loved them as well.  The manager/owner also came around to our table to see how we liked our dinner. I though that it was a great personal touch. He was very nice and attentive. Our service was outstanding.  I will definitely be coming back here soon. That street corn is enough to bring me back for sure and I would love to try many other items on the menu. Highly recommended.",

We had to try the table side guac which was perfection.It had pepitas on top- great idea.The chips  are light -the salsa heavenly.  Some pork belly lettuce wraps and amazing duck empanadas were perfect with our cocktails.  We moved into the dining room for dinner and were lucky enough to have our same server from the bar, Abeer. She was terrific.  She explained the menu items and made recommendations. The Almejas Al Vapor was wonderful...but HOT! Soak up the soup with the bread...yum.

    "text": "Based on Yelp reviews and general hype, made reservations for 3 for my buddies and I as we were meeting in Scottsdale for 4 days of golf.  The place was crowded (good) and atmosphere was great.  The right noise/activity level though quite a bit of the clientele were older (60+) semi-snobby acting loud-talkers.  I imagine it's a popular spot for tourists as well (though not during that VERY slow week in town).  The small bar area was much better and offered us the opportunity to wince as we watched an incredibly beautiful woman try to get away from what was clearly an online-dating nightmare...very entertaining and a study in body language for sure! Aaaayway...  As the hostess started to lead us into the dining room, we noticed that all of the 4-tops were quite small.  That-is, small for 4 guys 6'2\" - 6'5\" and 210 - 250 lbs.  We looked one another and made the obvious point...we would be packed next to each other.  We instead opted for the long high-top bar table and it was perfect for us.  Server (Meghan?) was excellent.  Cute little gal who did a great job explaining things and checking-in regularly.  Of course, we're hard to miss there in the center of the bar area.  Food - Quality was excellent.  Nicely presented but waaaaay to much emphasis on making it feel \"haute-ish\".  Latin dishes done very well but be prepared for excessively small portions.  They must run a fantastic food cost here.  Porchetta with house-made Chorizo (no more than 4 ounces) and a puny bowl/ramekin of pureed white beans and crema of some sort (maybe 1/2 cup)...$28.00!  Of course, nicely decorated plate and again, excellent quality and flavor profile.  But come-on, it's Porchetta and Chorizo for cryin out loud.   Also ordered their side of house-made tortillas - Four or five 3\" round little tortillas served on a big heated salt rock...$8!  Now THAT was funny...or not.  So - Good food, done well.  BUT I won't go back based only on the silly portion sizes for the money and trust me, I almost never gripe about the price as long as the quality is there.    Would definitely go back for drinks or a $7 Stella (yeah, I know) and maybe find that amazingly beautiful woman trapped by her stalker-date! (alas...sigh).",

We selected a table outside in the rear patio.  It was slightly chilly so they brought my wife a blanket.  Who would have thought Phoenix would have been so chilly...in mid April.

My waiter was very rude, as were the hotesses as if they didnt need any more business. On top of that a HUGE tip was taken out of my account when I didn't authorize a tip since i left cash. Claiming a dispute with  Deutsche Bank as we speak! Beware customers..check your credit statements!",

    "text": "I arranged a reservation for two persons at The Mission for a very special occasion well in advance. The food is excellent, the service was very good but the help at the front reservation greeting area need significant training. I was immediately greeted in a half empty restaurant by the statement that there was a limit of 2 and 1/2 hours that I could remain at the table. Really!  Two people for dinner? How tactless! This will be my last time that I will frequent this restaurant that had been a favorite for over 6 years. Again, the desk help need serious training! Ideal for tourists who like to spend money and most likely will never return, but for us locals there are a number of exceptional alternative restaurants available that know how to great guests!",

My husband and I were privy to a charming conversation with the manager whose passion for food and drink make it clear why Mission is so enjoyable.  San Francisco has spoiled us with amazing food choices, which makes it difficult to enjoy dining when traveling. Mission is a gem! The food, drinks, and ambience are sublime. Rarely have we read menus that made it hard to order - the drink and food choices really make you wish for more stomach space. Every bite and sip was so enjoyable. This meal might just have ruined our tastebuds for our hometown food.",

Unless, you're dining with someone you would prefer not to be seen with in public.  If that's your goal for the night, go here.  I dined with 3 hospitality professionals who were equally puzzled at the lighting situation and equally unimpressed with the offerings we selected.  Not one of us in the party would order the item we ordered again.  Over-priced Fish Tacos, uninspiring duck empanadas, tableside quac was made exactly the opposite of what we requested, but maybe he thought we didn't see what he was doing... Completely over-priced and over-hyped.    The people who enjoy this restaurant are not people I would like to be associated with.  UPDATE: Against my better judgement, I accepted an invitation to return.   Here's my updated review: Still sucks. The end.",

Both absolutely delicious!! I always get the table side guacamole and I tell the guy extra extra jalapenos. I like mine spicy! It's so good that I usually fill up way before my entree comes but seriously it's worth it!!  As my entree, I usually get the short rib tacos (which is to die for!!) but this time I wanted to try something else. I got the mahi mahi tacos but asked it to be grilled instead of battered. They are super small but it's seriously the perfect portion! And so many flavors packed into such small tacos! Heaven in my mouth!!! I also got the street corn. You know it's amazing with your tacos!!  My husband got the skirt steak and I had a bite and it was amazing!   Overall I love the mission! Great food and awesome service!!",

It had been 8 years so I thought they had remodeled. Nope. This was an entirely different restaurant and I am so glad we went there. The food exceeded my expectations by tenfold! We started with the tableside guacamole and chips and salsa. We also ordered street corn. The chips were made in house and were perfect. Not thick and processed tasting.   The server Tony recommended their margarita because they don't use mixes. Well, what girl can turn down a margarita? It was delicious!   My husband and I split the pork shoulder tacos which were smoked and braised in a habanero pineapple glaze and served with fresh tacos. I can't say enough about this dish. apparently, the chef is an award winning chef. I can see why!   We declined a dessert and Jeff asked for a coffee. They ran out of the type he ordered, so they gave him a cup of Americano on the house accompanied by a dessert. I would have taken a photo but we inhaled it. Yes, it was that good.   Tony was an excellent server and made great recommendations for us. We will be back soon. I think I may even bring my friends when they visit in January.",

    "text": "Nice, upscale Latin/Mexican restuarant. I've been here once before as part of a large group and we sat on the patio. I distinctly remember excellent service and a great atmosphere.  This time my small group sat inside and also had a good experience.   I'm 28 with \"perfect\" vision (thanks to Lasik), and I almost turned my phone flashlight on to read the menu. I mean really. It's insane dark in there, but I suppose it makes it intimate and romantic (just what I needed with my coworkers. :))  The service was pretty good. A little inconsistent and the last round of drinks took upwards of 15 minutes, but she was knowledgable on the menu and friendly. The man refilling my water glass was on it though, which I definitely appreciated! I had the blood orange margarita and it was excellent. I couldn't taste (or feel) the tequila, but the flavor was delicious.   Anyway, on to the food. The chips are served warm and they are the perfect thickness (which is thin, in case you are wondering). The salsa is great, a little smoky, a little spicy and overall just great.  We ordered the tableside guacamole and had the person make it spicy. It was definitely spicy and also delicious. Probably the best guacamole I've ever had but I can't pinpoint why.  I ordered the Jidori chicken and it was just OK. Nothing extremely special, just marinated chicken served on the bone. The cheesy rice it comes with is outstanding though. However, the dish is most certainly not worth $30.  Overall, I'll probably be back, but only as long as someone else is paying.",

Their appetizers were incredible, inventive and so, so good. Their main courses were absolutely phenomenal. We don't order steaks from restaurants because too often we feel like they don't turn out great, but this place- so, so good! Even our pickiest eater finished both his plate and another main course. Everything is so thoughtfully prepared, so wonderfully presented, and so, so delectable to the palate.  The margaritas- yum, go for the unexpected, you won't be disappointed.  Also- their decor is just gorgeous. It's a little expensive but also, it's one of the best places we have ever been. Just go here! It's one of our new favorites in Scottsdale. Will be here often!",

There seemed to be some confusion with our servers as we were greeted and placed drink orders with one, only to be greeted by another who told us he'd be taking care of us. We figured they'd sort it out, but both continued to come by throughout and check on us. Our food was good, but I wasn't blown away. I would have liked the tableside guac but $14 seemed pretty steep. Nonetheless, it seems like maybe this is best suited for evening cocktails. This area is full of Mexican food places (and cheaper ones), so don't let anyone tell you this is the best there is.",

The drink menu is extensive and everyone loved their drink. There's also a salt wall inside you can lick with your shot.

    "text": "Dinner at The Mission was lit  More so because I was nearly set on fire. But before I get into that, let me give you some background.   My boyfriend and I move from Chicago to Scottsdale for a job NYE 2018. We decided not to do a big Christmas or NYE in light of the fact that we're moving across the country. So Valentines Day would be our \"holiday\" to make up for the previous two. We heard rave reviews about the Fat Ox, and specifically because of chef Matt Carter. So we go to the Fat Ox on V-day and have an amazing meal. We were seated for our 8:30 reservation at 9:30 because they forgot about us, but we were enjoying cocktails at the bar so it wasn't even a concern. We were told \"definitely get the tableside Caesar\" so we did. And they came out already plated and dropped off like it was a free basket of peanuts at Lonestar. Bizarre. The rest of the meal was amazing. Best meal in Scottsdale up to that date.   Weeks later, we had family in town and thought \"Matt Carter also has The Mission in old town. Let's get Matt Carter some well deserved redemption and get the tableside guacamole\". We explained our excitement to our family and how we couldn't wait to clear Matt Carter's name. No joke, the tableside guac never came out. I was instantly convinced I was cursed. We joked around with the waitress and she offered to bring it out, even though we already had our entrees at this point. Amazing gesture, so thank you. But they made the guac behind a wall and dropped a cup of it on our table. Still very tasty, but just bizarre again, and we're super convinced we're cursed at this point.   A week later my brother gets into town. We said \"let's bring him to the Mission. He will absolutely love the food here.\"  So we went and...despite the curse...ordered the tableside guac. It came out, was prepared tableside and it was beautiful. The curse was broken! Oh wait...remember that part about getting started on fire? That's next. We finished dinner, and we were sitting enjoying some delicious margaritas when the table across the half wall gets up. They put their jackets on and their elbow hits a lit candle into my hair. It was like getting karate chopped in the back of the head with a hot curling iron. So then I had hot wax all down my back and in my hair. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. The table had no idea that happened and had left. So I let the hostess know what happened and she said \"oh that's not good. Let me tell the manager\". She never did. The manager ended up coming by on his usual rounds and I let him know, so he could maybe move the rest of the candles because it really hurts to get hot wax spilled on you. It's not anything like an expensive massage where you pay more for that. His response was \"wow yea some people don't pay attention to their surroundings\". Thanks guy. I'm not looking for free dessert or anything, but really just an \"I'm sorry, are you ok?\" because this actually hurt. So the curse is back and now it has the power of Jumanji. The man with the giant mustache and Winchester 1901 shotgun are probably going to show up soon...  If I ever dare to try Matt Carter's French restaurant, the Zinc Bistro, I might have them burn some sage at my table to clear the curse.  Then I can get my tableside experience AND get set on fire at the same time and it'll all come full circle.   Matt Carter is an amazing chef. His food is inventive, delicious, and incredibly well prepared. I know my experiences are not typical of his restaurants, but I have to think fool me once with a tableside Caesar, shame on you. Fool me twice with tableside guac, shame on me. Fool me three times with the third being a tea light Molotov...that's totally back on you.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my first-time visit with family for a Saturday afternoon lunch. Loved the tableside guacamole. They use all fresh ingredients and don't overmash the avocados.  Taco platters are good portions. You get three tacos, all the size of small street tacos. The pork tacos were loaded with meat. They were a bit too sweet for me but I can appreciate that they would be fitting for someone who likes that style. The butternut squash tacos are good, but I recommend them as an appetizer. They were much smaller (in terms of filling) than the pork.   This place is ideal for tequila lovers. The waiter told me they do tequila flights. But I opted for the blood orange margarita from their cocktail list. Their margaritas use all fresh squeezed juices.   If you eat inside, be prepared to turn the flashlight app on your phone. While the interior has a relaxing, candlelit vibe, it is super dark, hence no food photos on this post! The interior has almost a gothic feel. I could almost imagine cob webs hanging from the chandeliers at Halloween! A fun place overall, and service is great, too!",

The menu was very limited, and we got the tacos we were faced with 3 tostadas intead. The tacos were so small that they should not be called tacos, nor a meal. The meal did not have sides included and the menu also didn't have sides so we didn't order anything. The environment was ok, the food was delicious, but they definitively should not be called a meal. This place is great for a happy hour, don't go for a meal.",

The noise level is average, people are here to have a nice night out and enjoy themselves, but by no means do you have to yell to speak to the person across from you.  The wait-staff was also very friendly and they all seemed to be working together so you're not just relying on your one waiter.   As for the food, it was very good.  We ordered the guacamole per suggestions on Yelp.  It's made at your table and taste very fresh and was probably the closest thing I've ever eaten to actual guacamole.  My father and I also ordered the tacos, which were a good size and the meat was very tender, not fatty and had good flavor.  My boyfriend had the larger order of tacos where you are given meat, and tortillas on a slab of rock salt and you assemble your own tacos...basically what my father and I had except way more food.  If you can eat a lot I would go for it!  Overall, I would go back.  The prices aren't the cheapest, but the atmosphere is really nice and chic and the food is really good.  If you're looking a whole in the wall Mexican food place where they yell at you hot plate, (even though those places are awesome), this is not the place for you.  It's more of a night date night place or place to take the parents out to.",

The ambiance is always on point whether its just for cocktails or the meet and greet dating scene with the low light and solid patio.  The tableside guac is always a winner for my group and I'm always going for the Pozole no matter what time of the year it is.  The last time I visited I did the usual and got the Chorizo Porchetta but was kind of disappointed of the serving size versus the price.  Don't get me wrong it was beautiful and delicious but maybe I brought too big of an appetite for the evening.  Regardless the service is always friendly yet somewhat robotic which is chill for certain atmospheres but with the energy of this place I maybe expect something a little more engaging.",

    "text": "So far, every food item we've had at The Mission has been amazing.  Their must have item is the almejas al vapor.  But for our fourth visit, we went for a four course tequila tasting dinner for $65.  With tip and tax, $85.  Considering we spent that much on most of our \"yelp eats\" event dinners, all of which were three courses, each far less decadent and with no booze included, this was a GREAT deal...  Dos Lunas was the tequila brand hosting the event...  First Course: Roasted Pork Belly.  We had the pork belly during yelp eats.  That one was intense.  This one was even better!  And spicy from the Chile tepin.  It was on a peanut butter cream sauce, which may sound odd, but the heat, the peanut, the cherry margarita...  Wow.  If that was the best course, I was already satisfied.  First Course Drink: 5 small Cherry Margaritas.  FIVE.  EACH.  YUM.  We kept drinking them before the food got there and they felt compelled to refill us four times. :)  The cherry with the peanut cream sauce meal was an amazing compliment!  Second Course: Even better than the first!  I didn't think it could get better than the pork belly, but it did: Halibut.  It was perfectly cooked and had intense flavor. It was served over risotto that made my spine tingle with every bite!  Second Course Drink: Pineapple Coconut Frozen Margarita.  It was a lot like a pina colada.  Tasty.  Though large it went down fast!  I didn't feel it did anything for the Halibut the way the first drink did for the pork belly.  Third Course: It seemed impossible, but the third course better yet again. Filet Mignon.  And they don't even have that on their menu.  It tasted peppery, buttery, spicy and just so atypically full of flavor!  And of course it was the perfect tenderness.  It was topped with crab that was so succulent I finally had to scoop it off and eat it as two succulent courses to enjoy everything they offered.  Third Course Drink: A flight of three shots of Tequila: Silver, Reposado, Anejo.  The only difference: how long they sit in the barrel. 18 months for the anejo.  Three quick shots of tequila are always a great idea!  And the perfect compliment to that spicy filet.  Fourth Course: Stone Fruit Crumble Cake: the cake was ok.  It was topped with a Rum ice cream that was so potent I felt I was doing shots.  Rum after all that tequila wasn't the most exciting finale.  The dessert was the only let down, but with those first three courses, who cares!! :)  Fourth Course Drink: Iced Espresso Tequila Drink.  I am not a coffee fan, so I had to basically shoot this sucker down.  But everyone else seemed to really enjoy it.  Absolutely worth $85.  And then the finale came.  They let us have a half sized shot of the Dos Lunas Grand Reserve.  A 750ml (25oz) bottle costs $3000.  So a single 1oz shot of that would run over $120 retail, up to $500 in a resort bar.  So all by itself, this was more than we paid for the whole meal!  It tasted more like a cognac and not at all like an 11 year old tequila.  I would never pay that much for a shot, but man it was pretty cool to have.  GREAT event at the Mission.",

Today, Zinc is slipping and sadly, The Mission fails.  You will not be transported, but subsumed in noise and carelessness.  You might wait 90 minutes for your food ostensibly because the classically trained French chef wasn't satisfied with the initial effort.  Despite the redux due to someone's quest for perfection, the quality is inconsistent, vacillating wildly from damn good to downright shitty, but never sublime.

    "text": "Here's a new one.  Where is the best place to eat in Old Town on Christmas Day?  The answer:  an old white church in the middle of town.  On December 25, the doors to the Mission swung open at 2 pm, and not a moment earlier.  The crowd gathered outside this rustic old building immediately swung into action, darting inside to secure a table in the much sleeker and un-Church-like confines of a trendy Latin American restaurant, where the only thing that's holy is the tequila selection.    Indeed, the Mission boasts a most impressive interior, with beautiful furnishings that are aggressive but tasteful, contrasted nicely with antiquated style of the building itself.  Waiting for a table would hardly be a punishment on this festive day, but with a reservation, we were seated promptly.  The Mission is and always will be a successful restaurant, I think, because it serves truly first-rate food and drink.  There is no debating this.  Each dish that was brought out, from the duck empanadas to the crispy pork belly, packed enormous flavor into perfectly-textured bites.  The portions were sizable for appetizers, too, ensuring that you could create a tapas experience for yourself without going home hungry.  The cocktails were also delicately prepared and delicious, and in many cases inventive.    Because this restaurant has the food and drink down to a tee, it has the potential to be a five-star powerhouse for years to come.  But I hesitate to anoint it as such due to some conspicuous flaws in service, which should be easy to fix.  On at least five different occasions through the meal someone on staff attempted to remove a plate before we were done eating.  The wait time for drinks was also too long, perhaps owing to the cocktails' complexity, but also perhaps to the need for another bartender to churn out drinks for a thriving and busy restaurant.    Above all else, though, the service was friendly and generous, complementing well the warm and inviting vibe this space gives off.  Next time I make a southwest sojourn, I will gladly return.",

Long Story-  I had the halibut that was over maybe two tablespoons of rice and had a delicious tomato sauce poured around it that tasted similar to Campbell's Soup but better because I couldn't taste the tin can and it had a great layered spice to it that was just right. The top of my fish was sprinkled with some crisp taro threads and my petite halibut was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfect. Vegetables were not a part of this meal ($28)  My husband had the Chorizo Porchetta it was impressive coming out with a flaming rosemary stuck into it, I noticed that it looked like a petite filet  across the table in the dark but was a pork shoulder and the chorizo (a hard style chorizo) was stuffed into it, the plate had a very tiny dish of white bean puree on the side. I am looking at my measuring cups right now and the dish looked like my quarter cup but the dish of beans wasn't filled all the way so it was less than a quarter cup also vegetables were not a part of this entree ($24)   Both of us and the two tables seated on both sides of us thought it was too dark in the dining room you REALLY HURT your eyes trying to read the menu in such darkness no matter how young or great your eyesight is. The tables are too close together so much so that you have to pull your table out of the way for people seated on the bench to get out. Service was casual.  Petite proteins, less than quarter cup side with entrees (1/2 cup is correct amount of food) vegetable side not included,full price..I wouldn't mind paying $10 more an entree so we could receive 1/2 cup side portions and a vegetable portion.                                 We will not return.",

    "text": "Luckily my wife was with me or I would have given the mission 1 star based on my meal.  I was served one of the worst meals I've ever ordered in a restaurant.  I order a chicken entree from what I thought was a nice restaurant, not a pub. The server placed a large plate in front of me, it had a gigantic pile of fries and 4 pieces of chicken laid on top. The chicken was covered in a ketchup flavored BBQ sauce. That's it... It was comical that the chef actually thought of this meal. I wouldn't serve it to my 5 year old...   My wife ordered the tacos and out of desperation I reached over and grabbed a taco. It was amazing! I couldn't believe the same restaurant would serve 2 completely different meals. I don't get it.   Moral of my story is if you go to Mission which has a good ambiance and feel...just don't order the chicken entree! And if the chef reads this, please take that off your menu.",

    "text": "Fantastic day! My suggestion; Go in on a Sunday, around 4pm. The bar was pretty packed at this time of day, but the restaurant was empty.   Sit down in the restaurant area.  It is fun to watch the restaurant transition from a whimsical  Sunday Fun-day type atmosphere to an exotic and demure nightlife Restaurant.  Around 5pm, they begin to dim all of those gorgeous chandy's and close the thick shutters. Around 5:30pm, they start lighting and dispersing LOTS of little tiny votive candles to all the tables and wall mounted candelabras.   The restaurant is starting to fill little by little and the noise level goes from quiet to loud and bustling. The day shift is transitioning to night shift and the waiters are polishing their tables and preparing for a packed house. ( The restaurant is completely booked for dinner reservations ) The menu at this time of day is very simple as they are preparing for dinner.  But the simplicity of this menu makes it easy to order light hearted items.  The filet skewers and shrimp skewers are delicious.  Order the table side guacamole!! It is fantastic !  The bread pudding was delicious, but priced $2 cheaper on the menu than we were charged on our bill.  We were also charged for a chicken skewer $12, that we did not order.  We had to bring this to our waitress's attention after we received the bill. Good thing I doubled checked the bill as my husband didn't even look at it and just plopped his credit card down.  When I mentioned the discrepancy of pricing to the waitress. She took off the chicken skewer, but not the $2 additional charge for the bread pudding. We didn't push it, because who wants to be a bitch over $2, but just check your bill before you pay.  Overall, I loved they whole experience and I can't wait to go back!!!   Oh! I posted a picture of the bread pudding and the picture looks disgusting. Tried to delete the picture and I don't know how.  The bread pudding is delicious, even though the picture I took looks like bile topped with ice cream and bed bugs.",

Upscale Latin Cuisine served from an innovative menu paired with wonderfully tasting stiff cocktails. Need I say more. From the moment you walk into this place, you feel like you are right where you belong if you want to be part of the \"scene.\" The table side guacamole that is completely customizable is not to be missed along with the house pork shoulder tacos (\"for two\")   With four of us dining here, we were able to try a great selection of items from the menu. We thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes we tried from the Fried Pork Belly in Mexican Cola reduction Lettuce Wraps, to the Pork Shoulder tacos to the Chorizo Porchetta. I was ready to go back again if it weren't so hard to get a reservation.   They had a pumpkin bread pudding dessert that was simply superb and their fried bananas was a close second. Don't forget to wash down your meal with a refreshingly stiff Cadillac Margarita. You won't be disappointed here.  Check out some of the pictures of the dishes in full resolution at kitchenrunway(dot)com. I will be sure that this place is on the agenda with each and every vacay out to Scottsdale/Phoenix.",

The Restaurant knows why, and should do whatever it can to fix things! If you eat inside the restaurant you will be fine and eating at a 4 star restaurant. If you choose the back patio in the awesome weather of Scottsdale you will be making a huge mistake! There is an odor that will literally make you gag if not throw up. The odor comes and goes. Our waiter explained they thought it was \"chickens\" being raised next door. There are no chickens next door. Our large party came to the conclusion it is either a sewer leak or something decomposing. I kid you not, the odor is something terrible that it will ruin your meal. DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO SIT YOU ON THE PATIO ! I am very disappointed the management chooses to ignore the known problem at their customers expense. They know it is inappropriate to seat patrons on the patio, but choose to overlook it. SHAME ON YOU!",

We announced the food allergy and she very clearly understood it when we ordered but the waitress ignored the food allergy, served us food that made one member of our party exceedingly sick, spent the night in the hospital and ruined the entire next day, our only full day in Phoenix! The manager was very nice in person but asked me to follow-up then never returned a call. I just made call number FOUR and neither Bryan Adams nor partial owner Brian Raab have responded! So disappointed. To boot, they billed us for the dinner! HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE.  Lastly, we had reserved a 845 table, were told when we arrived it wouldn't be until 915pm but then they magically got us in 2 minutes after we had drinks in hand from the bar.",

    "text": "The Mission is one of those places that is so hyped up everyone \"loves\" it simply because it's the thing to do, the place to be seen, and where the cool kids go. The Mission was on every \"top\" or \"best of\" list I read and it was recommended to me by a few people as well. I consider myself to be a fairly cool kid too, and I'm not afraid to be the lone person to say \"This place really isn't all that!\"   The ambiance is one thing The Mission has going for them. With its many chandeliers, rich tones, outdoor patios... it's a beautiful establishment. Our server looked like he could be Adam Levine's brother, so needless to say, I was okay with that as well. I really can't comment on his actual service because every time he came to our table, all I could think about was the fact that it felt like we were having a discussion with Mr. Levine himself.   The food was pretty much a miss for me. Overrated mexican frou frou food is how I would describe it. They had the basics down... the chips and salsa along with our margaritas were good, but those are hard to mess up. Entrees either do not come with a side or with one small side, depending on what you choose. Sides are available a la carte for $6.00 each. My husband wanted the flat iron steak, which came with an extremely small tomatilla salad. He actually had to turn his plate toward me just so I could see it, as it was hidden behind his steak... a sign it was way too small. I tried a bite of his steak, but did not care for it at all. I'm very picky when it comes to meat and this was not lean enough for my liking. Very few items stood out to me on the menu, but I ended up selecting the mahi mahi tacos and a side of poblano grits. The tacos here are also very small. Three come to an order and they are roughly the size of an english muffin when laid out. Here's the funny part: they tasted exactly like the Gorton's fish sticks sandwiches I use to eat as a kid. I didn't like fish sticks and the only way I'd eat them was on bread with cheese and mayo to mask the flavor. It's a bad sign to be reminded of a childhood fish stick sandwich while trying to enjoy $14 tacos from this \"exceptional\" restaurant. Needless to say, half of my tacos were left on my plate. I did really enjoy the grits, but they should be a supporting cast member, not the star of the show. We did try the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert as well, and it helped save the meal. The pumpkin flavor really shined in this moist dessert.  So now it's up to you. Do you follow the hype, give The Mission a shot, and rave about it with all the other cool kids? Or do you see it for what it truly is? Simply a place to be seen with mediocre and overpriced food.",

    "text": "One word.....FUN! As my friend Patti said as we were leaving, \"I haven't laughed that hard in such a long time!\" That could be due to too many house special margaritas (which were really YUMMY!) or because we are a fun group of gals!   Either way, The Mission delivers. Service is great. The people working there are friendly (always a must for me to ever go someplace more than once). Food is good, but the portions would be too small for my husband who still eats like food like he's a teen preparing for a football season. For us girls, it's a great reminder to keep our figures svelte- and still feel pleasantly full.   TRY- Table side Guacamole. Guaranteed to be the most heavenly Guacamole you've EVER tasted! They add everything from cilantro to garlic, to hot peppers (to your taste), to cheese sprinkled lightly (or more heavy handed if you request it) on top. Last time there, 4 of us ordered 2 servings of it since the 1st time 1 serving wasn't enough for 2 of us (because it was so good I practically licked the bowl clean).   Maybe it was due to having a margarita first, or not being as hungry the 2nd time, but 2 servings + a drink + the chicken tacos was PLENTY of food (I even had to save 1 taco for later). Those cute little itty bitty 3 tacos don't look like a lot of food, but once you pair them with other offerings The Mission has, you will find yourself quite satisfied.   If you go to The Mission, be sure to bring good friends (or a significant other who doesn't eat like a football player). Be ready for great margaritas, great guacamole, nice servers, and a \"chillaxed\" environment.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "So good. Sooooo gooood. I love The Mission. The ambiance, the service, the food, the prices - all great.   Ok, so I've only been there twice. But even after only two dining experiences at a restaurant where EVERY SINGLE THING you order is delicious - not just ok, not just passable, but really, really tasty - it leads you to believe that it's a knock-out of a restaurant...like a guy that's hot AND has a personality. Don't think they exist? Yeah, well... neither did I. But they do! Ok, well, in restaurant world, that is...I make no promises about the real world.  Seriously, I don't think I can complain about anything, so let's just get on to the food. I started with a blended Lemon Margarita that was yum-tastic...the first time I tried the Mango (the flavors change daily), and it was better, but I'm not one to poo-poo any blended Margarita that comes my way, and The Mission's are particularly good. Anyway, we ordered the tableside guac to munch on before our meals arrived, and it was DELISH. Delish. Granted, it's only 1 avacado, but it didn't feel like too little guac, and we had 4 people. Anyway, they do this thing where they drizzle extra virgin olive oil over it at the end, and as WEIRD as that sounds, it makes it REALLY GOOD. I have no idea why. But it does.  For our entrees, we each ordered some version of the tacos, either chicken or skirt steak. I LOVED the skirt steak tacos...they were so good. They come tecate marinated with green chili salsa, avocado, lime, cilantro and cotija, and all of the flavors just work together magnificently...I think each one took me no more than 2 bites to eat. My friend that ordered the chicken tacos said they were fabulous, too, and after he tried the steak tacos, he said they were actually BETTER...I find that hard to believe, but I'll have to try them next time and find out!   In addition to the tacos, we got the Mission Fries, which is a massive basket of sweet potato and regular french fries with different dipping sauces. We also (inexplicably, I know...SO MUCH FOOD...) got the Grilled Sweet Corn, which literally had melted butter drizzled across is. Now, I'm from the Cornhusker state, and BELIEVE you me, I have had my fair share of sweet corn. So when I say that this was really some mad good sweet corn, you know I'm not just yanking your chain. Order this. It comes with only 2 ears, though, so be sure to order accordingly.  Also, order the churros. We didn't get them this time around, but the first time we did order them, and they're REAL good...maybe not as good as the ones at Barrio Cafe, but still delightful. I mean, they're chocolate and served with a milkshake. Seriously.   My coworkers were very impressed with my choice of restaurant, so not only did The Mission yield a superb meal, but it has also convinced my coworkers to bestow upon me all restaurant-choosing rights from now until the end of time...and THAT is fantastic!",

I'm only giving The Mission 3.5 stars because I thought the food was more beautiful than delicious.  My dad had the pork which was cooked appropriately for medium rare, but was a bit on the bland side.  I had the butternut squash tacos which looked wonderful--extremely colorful, but were also on the bland side in spite of the fresh lime wedges and slices of red chili (these tacos were also a bit pricey, $12 for 3 and the tortillas were the size of small sugar cookies).  My husband did seem satisfied with his hanger steak tacos.  Even though we planned on getting dessert, the consensus was that our dinner hadn't been particularly impressive so we opted to go elsewhere. There are a lot of rave reviews on yelp for the guacamole.  It was good, but not phenomenal and, at $12, it tied for the most expensive guacamole I've ever had (tie with a Mexican restaurant in NYC).",

The nice thing about Yelp events is for the most part they are filled with people who really want to be there rather than having to be there because of work or family or some other obligation.  Gabi is a wonderful hostess.  Not familiar with where I was going I made parking harder to find than I needed to.  I passed on the tequila as I wouldn't know a good one from a bad one, and I had to navigate home.  I had a great time.  Thanks Gabi for putting it together.",

I'll be honest, I was a bit scared of the Pork Belly and it's texture but i tried it and it was FANTASTIC!!! Full of flavor and I would recommend it to any amateur foodie who's looking to be brave and try something new!  We also had the Duck Carnitas Empanadas (DELICIOUS), the Guacamole and also Chicken, Beef and Shrimp Anticuchos or skewers which were good but not as unique as the Duck or Pork. Most everything is served with an aioli which really puts on the finishing touch.  For the main entree I had Swordfish Veracruz which was presented as a trio...Rice...Swordfish...Popcorn Shrimp(cocktail style, not fried). AND GET THIS - they garnished the shrimp with ACTUAL POPCORN. Very creative. But most importantly, well balanced spice, perfect portion and incredible flavor.   We tried three desserts, the Espresso Churros, Pumpkin Bread Pudding and Fried Bananas. My favorite were hands down the fried bananas...they were in a chocolate crepe of sort and had amazing flavor. The Pumpkin Bread was also fantastic...and...well...damn. So were the churros. OKAY I LOVED THEM ALL!  I will be back to try more.",

She made us feel very welcome, and introduced to some of the people there, and the conversations began. The venue was terrific, the people we met were universally nice, and the conversations really were a lot of fun...talking about food, restaurants, music, etc. Just a great time...We were sorry when we had to leave to walk our dog (not a euphemism).

The Mission does a wonderful job of combining various Latin cultures' cuisine into a dish to make it their own.  I got the chicken tacos, which sounds boring, but they were extraordinary.  They are served with an aji amarillo sauce.  Aji is a common Peruvian pepper, which has a wonderful and unique flavor, but I've never seen it on tacos before, since tacos aren't part of Peru's cuisine.  That's what I love about this place--they married the Mexican and Peruvian cultures and made something delightful out of the union.    I can't wait for an opportunity to go back and try their arepas.  The pabellon has my mouth watering already!",

We ordered the standard street corn \"off the cob,\" the table side guacamole, and the fries.

    "text": "Scene: Sunday night after a San Francisco Giants win, noisy bar crowd, policeman stationed near the entrance  I regretted not coming for lunch, which I would suggest, if you'd like a calmer ambiance. Request the back patio. The policeman's presence was curious, but I learned later he was there to watch for rowdy patrons, due to Scottsdale's bar scene. After a shade in the front patio hit my head due to the wind, I moved to another table in the patio.  The table side prepared guacamole looked great, but is quite a large portion for one. A server said I could have a taste, but didn't follow through. My server arrived, who was quite pleasant. He suggested items for vegetarians and his favorites.  He agreed on my choice of the Shaved Kale Salad. It was a generous portion, easily shared, with a delicious blend of sweet and savory, due to blood oranges, goat cheese and marcona almonds which compliment the kale. He told me the guacamole is only one size. I then chose the Roasted Organic Butternut Squash Tacos, since they are handmade. I was concerned about jalapenos but it's not a spicy dish. Beautiful presentation! Bite size tacos contain sweet butternut squash offset by a tasty mixture of spices.  I wanted dessert, but don't particularly like bread pudding, and chose it due to other Yelpers' compliments. I couldn't photograph it due to the darkness of the front patio. The pumpkin is quite subtle. It was disappointing that the ice cream had melted, and the small piece of bread pudding was almost submerged in the sauce, which created a mess. I mentioned this to my server, but he didn't offer anything else. I would choose another dessert.   The cooking at The Mission is quite refined and inventive, due to the chef's creativity. The restaurant is very busy, in addition to the bar, which overwhelms the staff. Try visiting for brunch, lunch or on a weekday night, when one could enjoy the delicious food in outdoor patios.",

We were provided a basket of chips and some delicious homemade salsa and then our server arrived and took our order. We selected the missionary margarita and the jalapeno cucumber margarita and they were wonderful! After ordering the pork shoulder tacos which was a combo meal for two we ate our guacamole dip appetizer. The attendant prepared the guacamole dip in front of us with all the ingredients that we selected. The pork was tender and the food was absolutely fabulous! Our table was never without water and someone close by to pick up our empty plates. Overall a fabulous experience and enjoyed the ambience. We will definitely return with only one hope and that is that they would have pen lights attached to the menus. :-). Thank you to the entire staff & management for a great anniversary dinner!",

My hubby and I came here for our anniversary and it was packed so we said we'd sit at a table at the bar. They smushed us into a corner with a wobbly table and no room for my hubby to stretch his legs so we decided to wait for a real table in the dining room which they were happy to accomodate. Restaurant and atmosphere is spot on and romantic. Amazing architecture and very polite staff.    We got a tequila flight which was sloppily poured, each shotglass had differing levels of tequila which was the first turnoff. Then our vegetarian taco appetizer came which was like 3 mini dumpling sized buns with unseasoned veggie inside with no toppings. I figured ok, hopefully the main entrees make up for it..  my husband's plate arrived and it was very pretty and he loved it. My vegan tacos on the other hand were just as bland as the appetizers and was the exact same size as the appetizer!  I asked the server if there was anything else they could offer because I was not happy at all with my dish. He said he would talk to the chef and upon his return told me that was all they had to offer me and sorry.  Our bill ended up being well over $200 and it was definitely not worth it for being happy with 1 out of 3 offerings. .  I would get a picture taken in front of this place again because the building was very cool looking but I won't be stepping inside again.",

I got the scallops and split my honeys entree, which I think we're tacos? I can't help but recommend this place to people. I wish it wasn't so loud though.

A large ice truck delivering ice was loud, the manager, Tom,was not helpful when we decided to address this. He informed us that \"as soon as we left, he was turning the music back up.\" My father had asked earlier that he turn it down, which they did. It still was on it wasn't off and no one appeared to notice the difference. I appreciate music during a meal but lowering the volume did nothing to the ambience, unlike the ice truck sitting outside the gate for 20+ minutes did. In a nutshell the manager basically said, his ice truck and music was more important than his customers. It was a very clear message and we had been so looking forward to coming here. This was my last night with my family and sadly the manager and his requirement to \"run a business\" and not concern himself with our comfort. What a great meal that ended in absolute disappointment. Come here if you choose but know that frozen water is the priority over a family of seven trying to enjoy a meal.  Please read my other reviews to determine if you think I am being unreasonable. I do try to be fair this was unbelievable and outright rude.",

That's not good service that's manipulative service and I will remember who you for that. You ask would you like anything else... or desert... don't specifically push expensive drinks as if that's being courteous. I shouldn't have given you my typical 20% tip. I won't ever again. In fact I won't ever order alcohol there again. When you get your bill for a hundred dollars and 60 of it is for way overpriced alcohol that sucks. The tacos and guacamole were good and reasonably priced but your alcohol is way over priced. How much profit do you make on a tiny $14 margarita?..way too much...that's what I call a rip off. That tiny drink should be half that price.",

First off the decor and atmosphere is great (Love the Himalayan Salt block wall) This place is upscale Mexican and a little pricier than your normal Mexican fare but absolutely worth it. The chips they bring to the table are fresh, warm, light and crispy and the Salsa is wonderful has a little kick to it but full of flavor. I wish they sold this bottled up to go. We also got table side guacamole which may be one of the best guacamole's I've ever had. Everything our table ordered was delicious, the pork shoulder and skirt steak tacos both wonderfully seasoned, succulent and tender. The papas y chorizo is wonderful and we also got a huge bowl of the mission fries which are a must try!",

    "text": "Oh Yelp, my sweet sweet Yelp... what a huge disappointment!!   I wanted to LOVE The Mission, I really did, but unfortunately we must've gone on an \"off night\" or something because our experience was a mixed bag. Let me start from the beginning. We were greeted by an awesome hostess with great energy who was extremely welcoming - kudos to her!! We were seated shortly after arriving and our waitress was also very friendly and honest in her recommendations, no complaints with the staff at all. The ambiance of this place is extremely romantic and interesting -  chandeliers, leather covered menus, etc. Beautiful.   The food descriptions were elegantly worded and ingredients sounded like they were offering great dishes!!! ...we were not served any of said great dishes. We started with the duck and foie gras empanadas. Foie gras is really having a moment right now and i understand why restaurants are clamoring to have it on their menus, unfortunately it felt forced on this dish. It wasn't necessary and it barely made a showing to be honest. I am a total foodie and have been enjoying dishes foie gras is the star (foie gras and waffles at the Black Hoof in Toronto or the foie gras mousse at Lolita in Cleveland for example) so having it as a garnish on an empanada didn't really do it justice in my opinion. Otherwise, the dish was fine. The real issue came with our entrees. My husband ordered the steak tacos and I ordered the porchetta - both sounded delicious!! - neither were. His steak was basically uncooked/rare in the center giving it an extremely chewy/soft texture, not to mention the steak was COLD. He didn't even finish the 3 small tacos. To quote him after his first bite \"I think they microwaved my steak.\" I ordered the chorizo stuffed porchetta and I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, the majority of the cut was pure fat and what wasn't fat (or chorizo) was very dry. I'm not sure what happened, but whatever it was, it was disappointing to say the least. The couple next to us was seated after us and their food came out before ours, so I'm wondering if maybe our ticket got lost and they rushed to get our food out? I hope it was something like that, although I'd much rather wait for wonderful food than have mediocre food served to me quickly.   The saving grace of the meal were the margaritas, they were excellent. I went out on a limb and tried the avocado margarita - who has ever had an avocado margarita?! It was really good. It was slightly creamy in texture compared to a slushy marg, but that didn't phase me. I ordered a second. Yum. My husband enjoyed his drinks as well. Between the drinks, ambiance and staff I think that a 2 star review is fair considering we went specifically for the food. I don't know if we'd ever go back, but I never say never.",

My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.  The bread pudding was EASILY the best I've ever had.  We usually don't order desserts and I'm glad we did, because I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was.    My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).  Since I'm pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their \"Sophia Loren\" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!  It was delicious and I'll certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)    Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????  I NEED this in my house!",

I really enjoy this place, it's inviting, the hostesses are so friendly and I just love the front patio when they have the fireplace going. They already had drinks from the bar, but I came in a little later and it took quite awhile before I got my first drink. =-( They sat us right away...as I had made reservations via Open Table, and our server was right there and ready to serve.  The place is always dark with lots of candles and after the sun goes down they will open up the windows.  There is a back patio and it is lit nicely.  Too hot to sit out in the summer.  Now for the food, we order chips and salsa to start...pretty standard, but when they brought in the extra hot salsa.....there you go.  It was awesome!  Way to hot, but if you mix it with the regular salsa, it's good. The guacamole is very, very good.  NIce presentation too, as they make it at your table.  We all ordered from the special menu that night and neither one of us were disappointed.  If you ask your server what their favorite is.....they will not point you in the wrong direction.  My server stated the Halibut was especially good that night...and that's what I went with.  Delicious!!  The only complaint that night was our drinks took awhile, but they made up for it when we raved about the hot hot salsa and she gave me a take home container.  Nice touch!",

So we're pointed to the bar area. It is now 6:30 and the dining tables are still half empty.  This is a good indication of bad management.  One doesn't tell a customer they can't be seat and must go to the bar to eat and then 2 hours later those same table are sitting there empty.   The drinks are watered down and extremely pricey.  It is one thing to charge a high price (small Margarita $13 and a Mojito watered down $13) and to give value, it is another thing to rip-off the customer.   The guacamole needed help as well.  We had to send it back to the kitchen for help.  You need to add Cilantro, onions, salt, etc. to the product, otherwise you may as well be eating raw avocados.   The fish tacos were good I thought, but my wife hated them. The duck empenada was different.  I didn't like it, but my wife did.   The service was slow to get to us, but once it did it was good.

    "text": "The Mission: It's not Mexican, its Latin, related to be sure but also entirely different.  The Mission is located in Old Town Scottsdale, and is situated between the old Spanish style church and the black smith shop for you old school Scottsdale folk. If you're looking for a great place to take out of towners for some refined Latin style cooking, and a taste of Old Town Scottsdale this restaurant really can't be beat.  It's one of the few places that still do fresh Guacamole tableside that you can have mild, spicy or hot. I recommend the hot, as it's how I prepare my Guac at home. Mike the bartender is quickly gaining a following as a specialist in \"spicy\" margaritas, but make no mistake Mike is a True mixologist and takes his craft very seriously. Mike will usually have two frozen margaritas on tap at any given time and one version will usually be spicy. I've had the habanero, pear & ginger (yes that's right), watermelon and the spicy mango. All are awesome. Ask for a sample. Mike also has other cocktails and non frozen margs always on hand.  The chips and salsa are done in house the salsa is great and has a wonderful smokiness to it. If you want some additional dimension to your chips and salsa ask for the additional salsas that usually have on hand for the asking. It's worth asking for it as they are wonderfully prepared and add another flavor depth to your culinary experience.  However you will need ask specially for the ghost chilies salsa, and its hot, hot stuff comprade so please be careful. In India they use ghost chilies to keep elephants away if you catch my drift.   I really love the Sunday afternoon pork taco all you can eat special. They roast a couple of pigs on property and serve until the pig is gone. The pork shoulder and the carnitas will rock your world with fresh made little corn tortillas. Its \"Delicioso\" as Jimmy Dean would say. You can also order the pork as entrees if you're not there Sunday or just want an entree; however the pork shoulder can't be beat as it explodes off the bone.   I had the Almegas Al Vapor which is Peruvian seafood soup. This blew me away and wonderfully balanced with a light creamy broth and very unique flavors. The soup is not over powered by the seafood and the whole bowl is nicely done and makes for a great tasting dish just to expand your culinary diversity. The other side order I have to recommend is the street corn. The corn is sweet, wonderfully spiced and makes for a wonderful addition to any meal.  While I haven't had them I hear the sweet potato fries are pretty stellar as well.  Two desserts that can't be missed are the pumpkin bread pudding and the espresso churros. The pumpkin bread pudding is made from scratch down to the caramel sauce. It's great even if you don't like bread pudding, try it. The other desert I really liked is the espresso churros with little chocolate milkshakes. It's a great dish for out of towners that may be a little reserved with food that they are not normally accustomed to.  The Mission is a small restaurant, so make sure to book reservations during the high season and most of all enjoy la dolce far niente.",

    "text": "BEST TACOS EVER. Wow. After trying a few restaurants here in Scottsdale and being thoroughly disappointed, The Mission really delivered. The tecate steak tacos are probably the best tacos I've ever had. The handmade corn tortilla is tiny, maybe 3 inches but is loaded up with delicious, tender skirt steak, salsa, avocado and cotija. It is the perfect taco - has a balance of flavors, and if you are like me (a carnivore) the ratio of more meat to tortilla is perfect, the salty crumbly cotija and creaminess of the avocado set off the flavorful deliciously tender skirt steak perfectly. The table side guacamole was amazing as well. So fresh and had the perfect consistency and loaded up with red onions, jalapenos, tomato, garlic, sea salt, lime and topped off with cotija and pepitas. The chips were warm, thin and crispy and seasoned well with sea salt. I hate when you get a basket of bland unsalted chips like at most Mexican restaurants. Not here.  My son got the chicken tostadas. Again, mini corn tortillas but loaded with flavor and topped with a spicy creamy sauce. Crispy and Delicious. My hubby got the pork shoulder tacos which were too sweet for my palette. Everything was fantastic! I am hoping to return one more time before we go back to LA.  This place is really happening at night. Very loud and crowded and dark. Very cool decor with crystal chandeliers hanging and a Himalayan salt wall. We were going to go here for dinner but it was just too loud and had too much going on for a newborn so we decided to go here for lunch which was perfect for us - it was not crowded or loud and we got great service. The staff was so friendly and they told us about their sister restaurant The House Brasserie which we are going to check out tonight.  I LOVE this place. My mouth is watering just thinking about those tacos!",

Ambient was filled with energy flowing, fun, laid back with a modern southwestern, chic feel.  Commenced with some refreshing, \"healthy\" cocktail - Bloody Orange Margarita, made fresh using real fruit with no sugar.  So good I ordered another.  Most of the drinks looked really good.  For the apps or botanas (as they call it), we had Duck Carnitas Empanadas, Pork Belly Pibil,and Almejas Al Vapor.  We ordered 2 of each as we wanted to share among the group.  I would have to say I enjoyed every single one of them.  NOW, the foie gras that came with the Empanadas, I thought was a little overdone so therefore dry.  Foie gras usually is softer and juicier with balanced flavor.  For the main entree, we had this tender Pork Shoulder that came with Tortilla complemented with a nice sweet, tangy sauce to drizzle over. Oh wow, just amazing.  The meat was soo tender that you just peeled it right off.   Desert - Pumpkin Bread Pudding, pretty good.  A little too sweet, but good.  I would definitely return for some more deliciousness!",

Yes, this is a trendy place in Scottsdale that people go to park their $20,000 BMWs and oversized SUVs and think that living there actually means something in between their salon appointments and residential real estate sales.  Now onto the food and drinks.  Ordered the cucumber jalapeno margarita for $13. Amazingly, it was delivered to me in less than 1 minute so I'm sure it was prepared that morning in a pitcher and tasted like any generic margarita I've ever had, just spicier.   The food was also mediocre. I ordered the tacos and was told it was small but I didn't expect 3 tacos that are 2\" in diameter and delivered in less 5 minutes. Clearly this also wasn't cooked to order and probably just heated up.  Absolutely nothing memorable about this food. The 4-star reviews just baffle me and I wonder if it's the scene more than the food. Given the location, it's clearly the scene.",

Lets start with the drinks. Got 3 of the house margs. NOT GOOD. I want to know what lime juice tastes like Mr and Mrs T's sweet n sour mix. That way I never get them. The menu stated fresh lime juice margs. Reminds me of a marg I had at Chilis once. Anyways, place was packed. We sat down and we got the tableside guac. I told the guy (in spanish) to tone it down, the 2 other people couldnt eat too much spice cant eat spice like us. He understood and laughed. It was definitely fresh. The guac was bland though. Especially for all those ingredients. We shared plates, but only the green chile duck confit on green sauce was anything I would recommend. One person in our party asked for a rum and coke. She ended up getting a vodka tonic. Crappy way to end it.",

I called at 5:30pm on a Sunday night to see if we needed reservations, at first the hostess said they had an opening at 8:45... but then recanted and said they could get us in at 6:45 and then I told her, 'no'. Then she asked how far away we were and all of a sudden could get us in at 5:45 (so initially that was off putting).... needless to say, glad we got there when we did because the place filled up quickly, also, if you get there before 6 don't bother with reservations, there will be plenty of available space. We sat at the bar so we could watch the football game - and I'm glad we did. Almost immediately, our bartender/waiter Jordan was there to greet us. He was very knowledgeable, very friendly, and seriously, genuinely seemed to enjoy his job. He was awesome!! We ordered our drinks, I ordered the margarita that Jordan recommended (Primarita) and my husband ordered the sangria/margarita (Missionary) both were very strong and very good. For dinner we split the dinner for 2 - pork shoulder tacos. The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth! Very flavorful! Then we decided to try a dessert. The espresso churros and milk shake... I could have just ordered that and been content. fantastic!! lastly, we decided to go for a night cap. A dessert drink. We both had the Rum Chatta/Espresso. It came in 2 Italian coffee cups.  All in all, we loved the decor, the coziness of the restaurant, the service was exceptional, and the food and drinks were spectacular! If you are looking for something a little different, not your typical Mexican joint, this is your place!",

    "text": "We were in search of a unique AZ-esque restaurant to take some clients to for dinner. Someone recommended we try The Mission for it's delicious food and amazing atmosphere, and we were certainly steered in the right direction.   The Mission, aptly named to coincide with it's old Spanish mission style decor is a beautiful restaurant tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale. This \"hidden\" gem was packed with dinner-goers on a Tuesday night. The chandeliers speckled about the ceiling were enough to make me want to move in, but it was the table-side guacamole that sealed the deal. One guest in our group said that he had always hated guacamole and that this appetizer changed his life. Listen to him. Try it. You'll never want it anywhere else again.   Often when you start on such a high note, there is bound to be disappointment later on. Not the case at the Mission. We ordered an array of appetizers to start, and the street corn was literally one of the best dishes I've ever had. Served on a stick...just like you would find at your favorite street vendor, the corn was the highlight of the dinner for me.   Following our appetizers came halibut, skirt steak tacos, salads and more. Everyone RAVED about their entrees and the only letdown was that we didn't have enough room for the churros at the end of the night.   The Mission has become one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. If you are celebrating something special give them a call and the friendly hostesses will set you up at a prime table and ensure you have dessert...with sparklers!   I'll be celebrating here for years to come.",

Yes, they can even make you an Avocado Margarita.  Sounds gross doesn't it?  Give it a try.   A couple of must-try's on the appetizer menu include the Street Corn (it's a bit sweet but very flavorful) and the Lamb Ribs, which is one of the tastiest things you will ever eat.  The entree menu is filled with several excellent choices- my two favorites are the Chilean Salmon and the Chorizo Pork Shoulder.  Both are melt-in-your-mouth amazing.

I started with the Pozole which is about as traditional as one can get but the Mission Chef made it modern and light, while preserving the traditional flavor profile.   For my entree I had the Brisket Torta and it was a absolutely delicious. Brisket was tender, the bread was heaven sent as the egg just put the whole thing over the top.

We had a very large party (18) and they were extremely flexible and able to accommodate.   They serve a nice variety of margaritas - some which I've never heard of before like an avocado marg. I opted for the primarita (their version of a skinny marg) and added jalapeno. Priced at $14 each.   We loved the table side guac - they offer a lot of options for mix ins like pepitas, cojita cheese, chipotles, etc. The street corn was also a hit, serving about 3-4 people. They kept the chips and salsa flowing!   The bbq shrimp skewer was tasty but a tad messy. My favorite thing was the roasted corn gordita which was basically thick tortillas topped with veggies, corn and crema. Highly recommend this item!!   I was very impressed with the presentation of everything. One thing to note is that the indoor area is extremely dark, so if reading menus without light is tough for you, I would recommend sitting on the patio. The inside area seemed good for an intimate date.",

The chips were extremely fresh. The salsa has a good flavor, but it's fairly spicy (which I like). I had the short rib tacos. They were also very tasty. The service was also excellent. The waitress was very helpful and steered us toward the menu high points in a professional manner.  Bad -- Everyone raves about the table side guacamole. I was underwhelmed. First off, I like my guacamole pureed. I enjoy when it's a nice creamy consistency for dipping. Since they chop it up at the table, it's very chunky. Also, I didn't think it had much flavor other than avocado and cheese. Maybe we didn't order it correctly. I definitely could have used some more garlic flavor.   My tacos were good, but they were tiny. Smaller than typical street tacos. If you roll them up, they're maybe three bites. For $14, I was expecting a little bit more food.   The restaurant was also extremely dim. Most people were using their phones to illuminate the menu. It was really hard to see. Also, the place was really loud. Probably a good place for a romantic dinner. Not the best for a business outing.   Overall, it was a good experience. But, it just didn't live up to the hype in my opinion (or the price).",

It was embarrassing for a restaurant to be this bad. We had salsa refills before we even had our water... as soon as we told him we didn't need alcohol we were the forgotten table. As if now we weren't gonna tip???  I think our waiter came by 3 times, total. Couldn't have been in a worse mood. Place is definitely busy, but no where near an excuse for the pathetic service.   At first the manager was not helpful, actually told us that we didn't get our food for so long because we waited half an hour to order... are you kidding me?? We would have if our waiter had ever showed up! He quickly realized that he had made a mistake and comped our meal which was nice. Wish the experience had been better. Seems like that was a rare exception, food was great.",

    "text": "This place was well reviews so when visiting Scottsdale for Spring Training we figured we should check it out! We got there at 6:15pm on a Saturday night and were quoted a 2 hr wait for three people, but they offered to text us so we decided to wait. It ended up being about an hour and 15 mins wait, which gave us time to walk around and get back at a reasonable hour! I would recommend getting there earlier than you want to eat for this very reason, or getting a reservation.  Once seated we had delicious Salsa and chips and there guacamole which was made table side, kind of expensive for guacamole if you ask me but it was pretty good. We were recommended the shrimp skewers and elote (grilled Mexican street corn). The appetizer shrimp only gave us three shrimp which again I thought was a little overpriced and I felt the sauce was a little too sweet. The corn was also a fairly small portion but it was kind of heavy so I wouldn't have wanted much more. For main course we got the pork roulette stuffed with chorizo which was very tasty and the carne asada tacos which had a healthy portion of meat on three fairly small tortillas. The cucumber jalapeno margaritas were very tasty and the perfect combination of spice, freshness, sour and not too sweet. Overall a good meal, nice ambiance, good service.",

I'll save you the long winded version, by it was Tuesday night. 4 of us had made reservations for the patio at 6:15. Drinks were delicious, food was on point, the mosquitos a flowing, but we didn't care because we were catching up and the ambiance was great. That's when abruptly I was approached by a gentleman who crouched down to me, with no introduction \"how much longer do you all anticipate being here? We thought 2 hours given for a reservation was long enough and I have an 8pm reservation\"  I think we were all stunned since our bill is up to around $300 at this point and we are still ordering dessert and a night cap.   He got up, again having no idea who he was until I ask the server.   Folks, this is a Tuesday. There isn't a line out the door. You're pushing out paying customers? And a party of 4 with starters, entrees, drinks and desserts in 2 hours? He could have handled that in so many other ways and we would have been happy to accommodate if in a bind.   Based now on other reviews I've read regarding service it seems like this starts at the top (management) and is trickling down to staff.",

I went for lunch and was looked after by Angel. This man is so friendly and you can see he takes great pride working at the restaurant. He was so enthusiastic about the menu. We started with the table side guacamole made to your liking. What a treat! The corn tortillan(my choice instead of flour) arrive on a salt brick and the longer you leave them, the more enhanced the saltiness!!! Then it was time for the pork shoulder tacos and the brisket torta (oh the bread!) and a healthy option of green beans!  I found the menu to be reasonably priced especially when all is home made using the finest ingredients. This is definitely a foodies treasure cove. The portions were big enough to share.  I loved the decor and the salt lamps are a talking point. Highly recommend. Could bot fault it.",

    "text": "What a great place.  Superb atmosphere, great food and the service was awesome.  It's a great place for 1:1 or groups.  They have a beautiful patio and the location is top notch. You must try the guacamole cart.    The only thing that holds back 5 stars for this category of date night place is actually in 3 areas.   1) the place is very dark (but super nice atmosphere. I would not change that at all. Decor is spectacular) and since the door to the kitchen is exposed to the center of the room, every 30 seconds to minute when a server enters or exits the kitchen, a giant flash of light hits the room and is annoyingly distracting.  The people to either side of us were also talking about it. Unfortunately we were unable to move but the waiter said he had received that complaint a number of times. Easy fix is to put a divider up above the benches in front of the kitchen. It's so annoying that you should try not to sit anywhere near that door.   2) the drinks and the corn are way out of whack from a price perspective from similar restaurants in Phoenix. Odd because the rest of the menu is on par.  They really hit you hard with a 15$ mojito that's all ice.  The corn is good but double the price of everywhere else in the same category in Phoenix.     3) anyone in the restaurant industry knows 92% of clients are either in a group of 2 or 4. Their tacos are served in portions of 3. So rather than enabling you to share two different types, they tell you they can make the serving 4 (of the same) tacos for more money.  Unfortunate because we would have like to try sharing another option. . Just not designed with the client in mind.   All in all, great place but I eat out 5 days a week in cities around the world, it makes it easy to see the simple fixes that would bring this place quickly to a seriously competitive place to dine. They would probably have been more full as well.   If I find out that they tweak these things, not only will I change the review to 5 stars, but I would send all my business traveler friends there.",

    "text": "I like that The Mission puts a different and modern spin on Latin dishes. The table side guacamole is terrific! It's fresh and of course delicious! I'd definitely suggest a double portion of guacamole if you have more than a party of four. The guacamole is so yummy you'll want more! Our waiter was great, the vibe is cool, but classy. Each person in our party ordered something different, but each of us were impressed. The street tacos are delicious, but more of a tapas serving, my suggestion is to definitely order sides. I also tried the strawberry coconut mojito. It was perfect! I didn't even realize I was into mojito's until trying one at The Mission.   Overall it was a great place for brunch, but I wouldn't consider it casual and I'd suggest making a reservation if you can. Also, while our waiter and the table side guacamole guy were great, the hostess could use a bit of customer service training. As someone who has worked in the service industry and now in Real Estate, she just had a bad attitude. If that's a frequent thing, I'd replace her.

My vegan friend who loves everything avocado I wanted to introduce to this drink. So we headed into the bar. I was disappointed to say the least.  The bartender overflowed our glasses full of ice and then poured a premade mixture of the avocado margarita into it with a slice of lime as garnish.   On the second round I asked for a little less ice and the bartender grudgingly put in less ice but then did not fill the glasses all the way. There was absolutely zero love put into this drink. For $15 per drink I expect a lot more.  I walked out with a $60 tab and no buzz. Sorry mission but whatever was in those avocado margaritas back in the day has evaporated.",

Great background music.   Menu:  varied  Latino flare with Mexican, central, southern, and  traditional Spanish  influences.  I needed someone to explain the flow of the menu since it was a bit confusing to me.  I didn't understand many of the ingredients and the pricing was a bit ambiguous.   Service:  though We were one of the first diners in the restaurant our server seemed rushed and a bit impatient/frustrated with our questions about the menu.  This is our only negative about our dining experience.  Her tone was almost condescending.  The dining room manager and the other food hosts were very accommodating, friendly, and as curious about us as tourist as we were about the food sources. Food:  the best guacamole I've ever had.  DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT ORDI can't remember the exact name but we ordered the duck confit starter which was enough to share between four diners. This was incredibly savory and finger licking good. My wife ordered the salad with pureed dates and date vinaigrette which was very quality and well portioned. I ordered the swordfish. Quality and attention to detail was exquisite and worth the price.",

The drinks and service were spot on and so far has been my best meal in the area. The outdoor seating was so lovely but the inside was very dark. Thank you for a perfect meal!",

I couldn't read the menu nor see what I was eating(we eat with our eyes) Could barely see my cute date.   Food. Chicken and some sauce maybe? 2 pieces OK that was OK for 30$ but the stuff below it was super salty...  flavor wise so so. maybe could use less salt more cumin(or cinnamon, or  what ever 30$ i really expected more flavor.)   So that was a no for me.   Dessert was good.  Though, when we ordered it they didn't bring us any silverware and when they brought it to us still no silver ware (so awkward.)   We had the Dark Rectangle and the cream blob, with crispy crunchy yummy chocolate flavored things..  I'd go back for the dessert ..but we have in your town plenty of other places..The music wasn't as loud as this breakfast place we were at with the DJ ..(which i really enjoyed my breakfast overnight oats.. at the other place)   compared to that place the music level was pretty good.   The guac. they have the option for cheese ..that was different and good, couldn't tell that we had finished it off ..but for 14$  I thought was kind of pricey, (should of been like $6 or 7..at most 10 cause the cheese) .. even if they make out side the kitchen..(chevy's used to do that) ..  more work for the wait staff less work for the kitchen staff..  ..:/  Maybe it's better to go at lunch.. so you can see what you are eating..  no idea.   Our waiter was working hard with the other people around us.. .  The other waiter seems more \"welcoming\" ..   oh well.   Is this the best in Phoenix? ? :(",

    "text": "This is such a great location for a business lunch because the place serves all you can eat chips and salsa and the food is served up quickly. If you get a chance sitting outside on the front or back patio is a nice option since the weather is great right now.  Now as far as quality of food my lunch did not hit the mark.  As our time frame was only for an hour we ordered table side guacamole and everyone ordered the carnitas tacos with pineapple salsa. Everyone I was with had been back to back in meetings and we were eating at 1:30 so everyone pretty much was starved and not really concerned about quality as much as getting in and out of the restaurant as fast as we could.  I watched my 3 business partners inhale their tacos without taking a breath. Me on the other hand decided to really check them out. Because I was at a business lunch I didn't have time to whip out my camera to take a photo for Yelp but I gotta tell you that my carnitas were literally just MEH.  The meat was not tender with no particular flavor and all I could taste was the small chunks of onion and pineapple that was sprinkled around the meat. While the tacos were street tacos they should really be labeled as itsy bitsy tiny, winy tacos. You could literally scoop them up and take two big bites and you'd be finished.  As far as service the Guacamole guy was awesome and friendly but our waitress was slow as she was serving diners both inside and outside on the patio.  While it would be a great place to hang out and have drinks inside or out, not sure there's going to be a next time for me as this lunch was quite pricey and for the amount of food served, I left hungry.",

In reading reviews after the fact this seems to be a somewhat common problem. I can't comment on the food as we unfortunately never had the opportunity to try their food. The interior of the restaurant was very dark and as near as I can tell from others that were eating, the portion size seems to be very small. I wish we had the opportunity to taste the food, the only thing that I can say is that the water was delicious and refreshing!",

No one was waiting and the restaurant was definitely not very busy.  No explanation was offered. My son gave the young lady a hard stare and said \"excuse me--I cannot sit here?\" She backed off but it was rude and quite uncharacteristic of the courteous service we have come to expect at The Mission Old Town.",

    "text": "A stylish restaurant serving a mash-up of Mexican, Spanish and French inspired food in the heart of old town Scottsdale.  We arrived a few minutes early for our six pm reservation and even though they had a number of tables open, walk-ins were being told 1 hour plus for a wait (BE SURE TO make reservations).  It's a pretty big place, long and narrow with a small patio outside in the front and another in the back.    Service here was very strong with water arriving at the table shortly after we were seated and our personable waiter, Greg, doing a nice job describing the menu and making recommendations. Glasses were constantly filled throughout the evening and Greg was there just when we needed additional drinks.  Drinks here are made with fresh squeezed juices and are lively and fresh.  I enjoyed the blood orange margarita and my wife the mission Margarita.  We got the special guacamole-prepared table-side (fresh and tasty) which can be customized to your particular tastes by you server. It came with a big bowl of thin and crispy chips and some smoky salsa.  For dinner, we decided on the slow roasted pork shoulder tacos for two ($34). You get a baseball-sized hunk of pork that's been simmering in a sweet pineapple habanero sauce along with 10 small tortillas and some chopped onion, cilantro and cheese.  This was more than we could finish and SO GOOD.  The only hiccup was that our dinner arrived while our server was just getting started with the guacamole but he wisely sent it back to the kitchen so we wouldn't feel rushed.  All in all a nice setting, good food and wonderful service.  Highly recommended",

Lovely, knowledgable waitress.  BUT - \"dim\" does not describe the lighting. Main dining room is beyond dark. Phone flashlight absolutely needed to see menu and could not see what we were eating, which is very problematic when you are sharing plates, need to shred pork shoulder and place with salsa on tortillas, etc. Despite how good the food is, the lack of lighting would make me think twice about returning given the cost (with liquor, we dropped about $300 for 4).",

    "text": "Ate here on Sunday 3/1 - it has a great reputation in town and we're here on vacation - our hotel concierge pitched it to us.  I should point out that we are no strangers to upscale dining in the Mexican or Latin tradition since we live in Chicago and frequently eat at Rick Bayless' restaurants as well as Salpicon and Tanta also great examples of the new Latin-style cuisines in Chicago.  First off, the service was bad through out the meal. Our server rushed us through dinner -- I think they like to quickly turn over tables since it's a popular spot.  As courses were brought out we had to ask for the table to be cleaned and water to be refilled.    Second, when the entrees arrived they forgot our side and second cocktail that we had ordered earlier.  When the manager came over to ask about the meal in progress, we had to point that out to him that item had yet to arrive, and he brought the items and adjusted the bill to remove the late side, a nice gesture.  A word on the Jidori chicken item -- it's a dry (over-cooked) chicken breast for which they charge $28.  Not much value there.  At $28 why not do a half chicken and charge $30?    Also, they have halibut on the menu - but it's out of season so rather than change the menu, they told us swordfish was subbed in for the halibut.  Again, a small detail but for these sorts of prices and its reputation, The Mission should pay better attention and not coast on its reputation.   So for the money and the service it's not a good experience.",

I sat with an empty drink for about 15 minutes before I could get someone's attention to get me another. The service staff seemed disinterested in being attentive. Each one of our party had a similarly disappointing experience. I wouldn't bother going back again. This was indeed unusual compared to other local restaurants.   The food was OK.

Name it, service, cuisine, ambiance (you need a flashlight or candle to read the menu), or friendliness...this is the place!  Date night? Yes. Celebration? Yes. Gourmet enrichment? Yes. The guacamole ROCKs, order it! The street corn rocks, order it!  The grits (both types) rock, order both! Try any recipe with pork shoulder. Each bite is a celebration of flavor. I was pounding on the table with joy. Pumpkin bread pudding was a celebration of wonder. Order it.  Don't come without a reservation unless you feel lucky. We saw people being turned away. Come hungry. They limit your time...so say for a 5:15 reservation, they politely indicate when being seated that you have until 7 (rare, but they do it well). This didn't bother us at all as we had plenty of time.  This place is a Scottsdale must, possibly even a Phoenix must. You MUST dine here.  Bon appetit!",

Then, we had the Malbec braised short ribs which were melt-in-the-mouth tender with wonderful flavor.  I love the location being in the old town part of Scottsdale.  The only negative was the sweet but overly descriptive waitress.  If the owner/manager is reading, it is unnecessary to describe the minute detail of every single dish.  I have had lectures on black holes and the big bang theory that were less involved and shorter.  This is a great place to take out of towners to show them that AZ has some talented chefs.",

Our table wasn't the best, kind of crammed up against the wall but I think they had to do some rearranging due to some rain showers that kept popping up.  I ordered steak tacos and my date ordered an entree with steak as well. Perfectly cooked and very good flavor.  Overall it was a great dining experience. I didn't pay, but I do know it was very pricey. The portion sizes were about just right. I'd definitely recommend to others that are looking for an intimate atmosphere that's romantic and has good food.",

We weren't aware that one of our guests has major food allergies.  Adam our Server (and a Manager) is awesome and was so kind to her as he pointed out items she might be interested in and that he would speak to the Chef so her food would be prepared the way she could enjoy.  The table side guacamole is fabulous - LOVE those pumpkin seeds.  The service was marvelous and the food absolutely delicious.  To end the evening, Tom came over with an after dinner drink for us - 1921 - YUM!  We had never had it before - perfect ending to a perfect ending.  Thanks to Adam and Tom for making it so special.  I am a Concierge at a luxury residence club and recommend The Mission to many, many of our guests - they always come back and tell us what a wonderful experience they had.  After our experience this evening, I will continue to send our special guests to this special restaurant!",

Now here comes the part as to why I gave this place 3 stars.  After waiting for our food for 45 minute a manager comes to our table and tells us that we need to hurry and eat because she needs our table for a reservation in 20 minutes. UNACCEPTABLE!!! You should never tell your customers to hurry and eat. If they knew the tables were reserved they should never have seated us there.",

My boyfriend and I went to the Mission for our 4 year anniversary dinner because we wanted to try something new.  The Mission looks really cool inside and there are pretty chandeliers hanging around. We got drinks at the bar while our outside table finished being set up - we ordered red sangria and a Michelada style beer - both were great.  Our table was outside on the patio and it was a gorgeous night. At first our waiter seemed MIA but then he made himself more apparent. For an appetizer we ordered the Duck Carnitas Empanada and it was sooo good. Then for dinner we shared the Pork Shoulder tacos and they were awesome. The hand pressed tortillas were a little smaller than the palm of your hand and then you created your own little taco with the pork, cheese, onions and cilantro. It being our anniversary, they comped our dessert and brought out the Pumpkin Bread Pudding and it was really good, rich, and I couldn't stop eating it.  Highly recommend The Mission! I would definitely go back - so much to try on their menu.",

The place is candle lit and very romantic if you're in need of a date destination. It's nice to have a drink at the bar while munching in some table side guacamole (highly recommended). The patio is a different feel and is awesome if the weather is nice. I ordered the pork shoulder and green pozole. They also have an amazing kale salad (I'm a sucker for kale).

Going to Mission was a spur of the moment dinner idea, and we made reservations just an hour prior to dining. I would suggest reservations, we had to sit outside because they were full inside, and although they had a large and amazingly quiet fan outside, it was a bit hot. We sat by a fountain though, and that kind of made up for it, definitely will be back for more patio seating here when the weather cools down.  The waiter was very attentive, I think in part because we were one of the first tables seated on the patio. By the way, I am talking about the back patio, not the entrance area patio- I think the one in the back is better.   Our app was the cheese plate, we chose the cheese similar to manchengo (I don't remember the name exactly, but the waiter related it). The cheese plate came with all kinds of goodies.   I had the kale salad for dinner, and my boyfriend the pork tacos. We also got a side of street corn, our favorite. Everything tasted great. The kale salad had tons of marcona almonds, oranges and a light dressing, the portion was large. I had a bite of the tacos and they were great, but they are small and 3 to a plate, so for bigger appetites consider getting extra tacos.   Dinner here was great, we will be back soon.  (:",

Then he took our guacamole before we finished eating it. She told me that she would serve the mahi ahi tacos to a five year old. I agree. Why beer batter a great fish like that? It tasted frozen or pre-packaged. From a restaurant that isn't a chain I was sorely disappointed. Let us be honest. The portions are great for skinny Scottsdale courtesans, however like most terrible Mexican places, I filled up on the chips.   Maybe I just had a bad night. When I return I expect better service.

The coolest thing about this dish though, is the fact that the tortilla was served on this giant brick of clear salt - super cool. - Salsa: SPICY and tasty - Guacamole: THE BEST GUAC I HAVE EVER HAD! It was made right next to the table after you order it. It has pumpkin seeds, and I don't know what kind of crack, but i could not stop eating it.  And for entree, I had - Hangar Steak with house margarita, which were just okay. Apparently the steak taco is supposed to be very good, maybe i should have ordered that instead.  This place is seriously super trendy filled with dressed up people. Nice for a great evening out.",

Within minutes we received our drinks and appetizers were on their way. In addition, the staff was overly friendly and made you feel right at home.    Everything here was delicious and amazing, from the food to the drinks. Give The Mission a try, you won't be disappointed.",

Many other restaurant's table side guacamole can be a little over the top but these people know how to do it right.  Excellent atmosphere -- classy but very casual.  Misted patio for the summer.  But the food......",

That's why I'm always wary of Mexican food in other places - even in AZ, which has a legit stake in the purveyance of delicious Mexican.  The Mission then was a fabulous adventure whereby I immediately regretted my restricting belt and longed for the welcome spandex comfort of something a little less buckled. We had delicious guac, excellent sangria, a spicy kale salad that will inspire home dinners to come, the only pork belly I've probably ever liked, incredible bistek and pork and lettuce wraps.   It's my personal mission to get back to the Mission as soon as I can.",

I must start by saying.. don't listen to the waiter when he says their special margaritas (primarita margaritas with agave nectar) aren't sweet.  I do not like sweet drinks so I ordered it. When we got them and they were very sweet, our waiter gladly took them back.  I drank my tequila (Milagro smoth and smokey) straight from there and we had no problems.  Nice array of good tequila's. So we started with the Kale salad... yea I know, Kale, Really?? It was SO good.  We loved it.  The Guacamole, tacos etc were top notch.  Just when we thought things couldn't get any better we ordered desert.  OMG the mocha moose like desert with nibs, ice cream and a plum sauce is out of this world.  Wish I didn't have to share it..lol",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to hit this place for dinner on our last night staying in AZ after an amazing 2 week vacation.  Its menu and good reviews drew us in immediately.  Old Town Scottsdale is also such a great fun place, we just had to go back to have our last hurrah there.  After not being able to make a reservation as it was completely booked, we were pleasantly surprised when the hostess found us a table for two just as walk ins.  We ordered a couple of beers and decided to get the two appetizers that grabbed us the most.  The Duck Carnita Empanada and the Pazole.  When my wife got the empanada, she immediately realized there  was no way she could eat that then an entree after it.  It was a very large portion and rich/heavy.  I didn't mind that so we switched and she took the pazole.  After a few spoonfuls she told me it was very salty.  I was surprised because we are salt fiends and never complain about saltiness.  I took a few spoons and yes, it was extremely salty.  Inedible salty.  If you have ever had Kalua pork at a luau, you would know that it is very salty, but in a pleasant way.  This was way more salty than that.  We told the server and he immediately said they would take it off the bill.  Considering the reputation, I would have thought they would offer a free drink or desert, but that is ok.  Anyway, my empanada was good, just very filling, and unfortunately I ordered the Duck Confit for dinner, so double rich duck dishes.  My wife got the snapper which  was extremely good and made up for the salty pazole.  I was relieved.  I thought maybe we hit a place that was all hype, but no, this place is legit and very good. They just probably had one of those moments where someone in the kitchen didn't taste before sending out the dish.  I will never hold that against a restaurant the first time.  We were too full for desert, so that was it.  The place was super busy, hip, and dimly lit, which we like.  Service was very good.  Dammit though, I was really looking forward to my 2nd ever bowl of Pazole.  My first was while visiting AZ last year and I had been craving it since.  We will be going back to The Mission as it has a very interesting menu that deserves investigating further.  Plus it's a fun place, albeit pricey.",

    "text": "We have been to The Mission several times. The salsa has a nice smoky flavor to it and it just thick enough so stay on the tortilla chips. We usually order the pork shoulder taco platter which comes with all the fixings to make ten miniature tacos with.  $32.00 The pork shoulder is served more room temperature, so if you want it hot I recommend you ask for it to be heated prior to serving.  For two people one order is plenty, therefore, if you like guacamole (and they make it table side how you like it there), you may find it a stretch to finish the taco platter.   Table side Guacamole:  $12.00 It can get noisy at The Mission, so if you are going to an intimate meal or a dinner meeting I do not recommend it. This is a great place to grab lunch or a Margarita at dinner after enjoying Old Town.  There is a lot of history at the restaurant so it is worth exploring that prior to going so you can appreciate what you are seeing or a part of when you are there.  Tables are small is one of my complaints.  The serving dishes they use for their menu items wind up being crammed onto the table leaving little room for a cocktail and a glass of water making the meal less enjoyable. If you make a reservation after six or so plan on being seated late.  We have never been seated on time.",

As listed on the Arizona Republic's 50 Best dishes in Phoenix. Yeah I had to try this.  I must admit it was good!  A great mix of creamy broth, roasted corn and clams.  A terrific marriage of flavors!   I have dined at the Mission on numerous occasions.  They sell themselves as nuevo latin cuisine, however I feel they are a solid representation on upscale traditional Scottsdale dining.  Thomas Keller trained Chef, Matt Carter, is doing a terrific job illustrating to both locals and tourists alike that Scottsdale / Phoenix is more than just kitschy southwest style food.  Carter has put forth efforts in conquering french cuisine with Zinc Bistro, Asian fusion with nine 05 and latin with the Mission.  He does all of them well.  The Mission has it all with good eats, a spectacular outdoor patio, and indoor atmosphere, replete with a translucent salt block kitchen wall.  Carter really created an atmosphere that diners want to be a part of.    His award-winning soup/appetizer titled Almejas al Vapor is definitely great.  But also be certain to try the Pork Belly Pibil.  A lot of great chefs are offering pork belly these days,  a very undervalued cut of meat.  Not only because it is a rather inexpensive cut that they can make a buck on, but because under the right slow cooked or braised preparation it is heaven to eat.  The perfect combination of succulent pork fat and lean meat with just the right amount of citrus, aciote/annatto seeds, and allspice make s a great first course.  Also worth trying is The Mission's Puerco Porchetta.   A spectacular slow cooked pork shoulder roulade stuffed with chorizo, rosemary and cojita cheese.  I have ordered this many times.  Make certain to ask for a moist middle cut.",

But I did notice that most other patrons needed to use their cell phone flashlight apps to even see/read the menu. What I DID mind was being seated in such close proximity to other diners. I was sitting nearly on top of others on either side of me. I was subjected to other peoples' conversations, and not because they were yelling or I was eavesdropping.

It really made me fee like I was in Phoenix.   For those of you who've tried Dos Comino's in NYC, Mission is right up there with them. The guacamole was made table side but was a little too spicy even though we asked for medium. Even with the extreme spice it tasted extremely fresh and authentic had the crispy pork belly appetizer and shared the pork shoulder entree with a friend. The corn tortillas were fresh and the pork was fork tender.   They had negro modello on TAP which I've never seen in the northeast.

They took something simple and elevated it with the addition of salty & spicy peanuts and rich honey which was absolutely marvelous.  For the main dishes we had the pork shoulder stuffed with chorizo and fresh made tortillas and the Grouper. The pork and chorizo was amazing but a little heavy so I think the portion could have easily been cut in half. The grouper was nice but the small crab cake that came with it melted in your mouth and outshined the fish.  For dessert we had French press coffee and churros. One word....YUM",

The guacamole was really good and the atmosphere was nice which redeemed the experience somewhat.",

Oh, and the pumpkin bread pudding was just divine. Cole was our waiter and he was so very professional. I recommend this restaurant to anyone...it's definitely worth the money.",

We sat down at the bar, and the bartender was extremely nice. 35 minutes went by and we had to check with the hostesses, to get a status on our table. Well, turns out that apparently they forgot about our wait; then, we notice there were 3 tables empty (they might've been previously reserved, but nobody came to sit down within the time we dined there) , hostesses might've forgotten about us. After all, they were really busy chatting it away. Overall, the food was good and our waitress, Lexie, made it all better.  Very nice place, you should come and check it out. But, make sure you keep an eye on your waiting time.",

The Cubano Torta was just okay, the bread was a little dense and there wasn't enough moisture in the sandwich to make it really enjoyable. The meat was good on it owns but the bread was too much.   We also got the table side made guacamole with was really good. The table salsa and chips were great as well.   The service blew everything out of the water though. All the employees were very prompt it keeping the table looking clean and removing dishes that were finished and keeping the water glasses full.   One gentleman even laid a napkin down on the ground for my friend who put her purse on the ground next to the chair.   The patio was a great escape from the sun but allowed us to enjoy the weather.",

As far as the taste of the food goes, this place is definitely 5 stars, but for what you pay for and what you get for portions is why I didn't rate it 5.

First of all, it is so dark you cannot see your meal they have these tacky chandeliers that are useless. Next they bring you chips and salsa which is the best thing about the restaurant. Do not get me started on the food everything is spicy even the \"sweet corn\". This place is the epitome of modern Mexican chic gone disastrous. We were overcharged and the food was horrendous, our entire group got sores in our mouth the next morning from the food. The owner is also very rude and will not survive in the industry. If you are considering going here don't save your money and go get an enjoyable meal elsewhere.",

The tacos we ordered cane as beef and of course we ordered chicken. So we had our appetizer at the same time as our meal. We also ordered fries and of course we never received that! We gave up at that point. We then proceeded to ask for our check and that took us 3 times to ask and of course when we received it they charged us for another meal that we didn't order. That took 15-20 to get settled. Embarrassing  Only reason it deserves 3 stars is because of the food. If you can handle the frustration of the service I guess you should come here. Probably not worth it. This is Scottsdale there are plenty of other Mexican restaurants.",

Next time I'll take $100, walk down the street to Wadaa and feed all the people at Whiskey Row some wicked good real street tacos.",

We decided to sit on the patio since there was immediate seating. The atmosphere was really nice they had some casual chill music playing and the fireplace made it serene. The service was great and great recommendations were given. If you don't enjoy the culinary arts I really don't recommend you come here, the portions are small but full of amazing flavor . The drinks were also delicious. The location of the restaurant is perfect for a long stroll through old town Scottsdale after a decadent meal.",

The margaritas were excellent as was the street corn and tables side guac. I ordered the duck confit with a peanut mole over some hominy with cheese. It pretty much all disappeared into the sweet duck glaze, no savory from the hominy and no spice from the mole. Just sweet. The duck meat was perfect though. The person I was with ordered the pork tacos for two. It was dry and bland.  I'm guessing it was an off night. A high price to pay though.",

We came in and were seated immediately. It was incredibly dark inside which was one downside. The restaurant had a cool feel to it, I really liked the setup.  We got the tableside guacamole and it was cool to watch them make it. Also it was incredibly delicious. I ordered the butternut squash tacos, it was either that or the black bean torta. I will get that next time I go! I am glad I got the tacos though. The tacos were incredibly small so I'm glad I had Guac to fill up on a bit! My mom got Huevos rancheros and my sister got the steak tacos. They both really enjoyed their meals and I did too. I left feeling very satisfied! Overall the lunch menu wasn't too crazy expensive too, pretty reasonably priced. Also the servers/hostesses were all incredibly nice which wins points in my book!",

From the knowledgeable waitress to the entertaining table side guac -- I can truly say they've trained their staff. But much of the show was a hostess with a tattoo consistently resetting tables around us, carrying trays, running food the next second, and then going back to hosting. Lastly she charmed us even more by stopping what she was doing to guide my folks out. Many restaurants lose their sense of hospitality when it's busy but this place isn't one of them and she's was a gem to our experience.",

Seriously, I'm not sure I'll be able to go to my usual street taco place anymore due to the change in my expectations!   So so so tasty, rich in flavor, the perfect mixtures.   We ordered a couple of different flavors (I'm regretting not trying the seafood) and had one of each.. I couldn't tell you which was my favorite.. (The steak did stand out)   Another good sign of a good Mexican restaurant is their chips and salsa. I almost filled up completely on chips and salsa because they were so hard to resist!! The table side guac wasn't bad either.. But I am through and through a Barrio queen quac lover.   We were completely stuffed but celebrating a birthday.. Well the pineapple upside down caramel bite of heaven changed my life and I would consider going back just to fill my sweet tooth cravings!   Definitely go check it out if you're a Mexican food lover!",

At the same time we got our chips and salsa, another guy asked if wanted some guacamole.  We looked at each other and said sure.  We thought it was part of the chips and salsa.  When we got the bill they charged us $12.  We all thought they were a little deceptive in how that transaction worked.  Each of us ordered a different taco.  All tasted great BUT in my case the short rib taco had a tiny nugget of meat on it.  I guess when they smoked it for 12 hours it shrunk to nothing.  It was a small taco to begin with but it was stacked high with the garnish.  I would have like more meat on it.  Yah it is probably a cool place to go but next time I would rather go somewhere where the taco's are more substantial.  For what we got it was pricey.",

It has great ambience and elegant decor, so it does give a feel of a fancy night out. Though menu has limited vegetarian options but I was happy with whatever I had tried.  However, after my second visit, I am kind of second guessing myself! Today me and my husband thought of trying it again during the lunch hour. Place was sparsely occupied may be because we reached after 3:00 PM. They had limited lunch options but more than that we were disappointed with the consistency of the food. They tasted much better the first time than this time. We'd ordered Guacamole and Tortilla chips which was fine, nothing spectacular! It came with red salsa which was very salty. We also ordered butternut squash Taco and they said they were out of butternut squash and they will replace it with 'mushroom' and 'corn', which is acceptable but what they brought was not acceptable. All they served me was corn on corn tortilla with no trace of mushroom. For that price all they could offer was corn filling, really?? I did mention to the server but he tried to convince me that it had mushroom. I wish I had taken a picture! I did like the pumpkin pudding but definitely not visiting again for the pudding. Overall, today was an average experience!",

I echo the sentiments of many on Yelp regarding the service.  Our waiter was knowledgeable, helpful, and passionate about the menu.  The menu?  Every dish on the menu stood out, making selection a difficult task indeed. We ordered some tacos. While they were on the light side, in terms of portion, every bite was was brimming with flavor.  The Kobe dog was underwhelming.  It is difficult to make a $12 hot dog taste that much better than its $2 street equivalent.   We were just there for a quick lunch but rest assured we will be devoting more time to thoroughly explore the menu and to indulge in that pumpkin bread pudding.",

We had been to Scottsdale before and tried more than a few good Mexican joints, but as The Mission had the highest ratings on yelp, we knew it was a must-try while we were in town.   Overall, the ambiance was steller. The restaurant was designed and decorated to look like a mission and had great patio dining with awesome lighting and candles everywhere. it is in a nice part of town with great shopping as well so great area to walk around in before or after dinner.  After sitting down, we started our meal with margaritas and house-made guacamole. My coworker had the guacamole margarita and said it was outstanding. I ordered the primarita which the waiter said was the house specialty and rated the best margarita in scottsdale. While it was definitely good I didn't find it all that different from other margaritas I have had in town and really didn't find it worth the $12 price tag. Our waiter made the guacamole right at the table and my coworker (as you can tell, a guac enthusiast) said it was awesome as well, but I (again) didn't find it all that unique.  My coworker ordered the halibut and I ordered the Duck Confit as our main appetizers. We were a bit confused as the restaurant markets itself online as a latin american restaurant, however when we arrived our waiter described the food as more of a latin american/french fusion. While the halibut and duck were very good, we found the plates to be overly complicated and the flavor profiles to be very confusing. Even though all the dishes sounded very tasty, the execution didn't really come through and the overall experience of the dish was very muddled.  Overall, The Mission is a great restaurant but I would aim to come here more for drinks and appetizers rather than a full meal. I dont really feel the food lives up to the price point.",

Also, don't overlook the corn on the cob, street style.  Really yummy.  We also thought they make the best margaritas we'd had in a while.  Loved the ginger & cilantro one, and also loved the pink grapefruit, which was in the soft-serve freezer that they use instead of a blender for slushy margaritas.  The decor is very cool.",

What a great combo of squash, cotija cheese and a hint of truffle oil.  Pumpkin bread pudding was a grand slam in a cinnamon caramel sauce with toasted pepitas and fresh pomegranate seeds. Visually beautiful and very tasty. Get a bunch of plates and share them.",

We also recommend the beef skewer appetizer. We added the foie gras but didn't see it added so the waitress brought out a whole new app with it at no charge. The house margarita is the best I have had in old town. Everything tastes savory, fresh and delicious.",

We ordered table side guacamole and the Jidori Chicken Wings (not a huge fan of typical chicken wings, but my husband loves them) and these were SO good. They had amazing flavor - I was pleasantly surprised!! We also both had the cucumber jalapeno margaritas which were both refreshing and delicious, although I thought they could be a little more spicy! For dinner I ordered the Green Chile Duck Confit. It was rich and tasty, the hominy was my favorite.  Service was good, attentive, and knowledgeable about menu items. You really can't go wrong with what you order, the hardest part of choosing! We will definitely be back!",

The service is top-notch and our server (Tony, I believe) recommended some great dishes. In fact, we ordered pretty much everything he suggested and loved it all.   First, the tableside guac. SO good. We got medium and wished we got spicy as it was barely spicy, but it was still delicious. Huge chunks of avocado and the chips are amazing - and the salsa is unique and tasty. They're also very generous with extra baskets of chips. I had a couple of their signature Primaritas, which were delicious and the rest of the drink menu looked great as well.  For entrees, we ordered the marinated jaribo chicken and the chorizo porchetta. I only tried the rice from the chicken dish, because apparently it was too good to share :) The porchetta is a generous portion and very rich, but incredible. The edges are so crispy and amazing and the garlic sauce is great. We were too stuffed for dessert, unfortunately.  It is a little pricey, but very worth it.  Fantastic place for a cozy date night - can't wait to go back!",

The interior is just the way I love it, dark, cozy and cool. We chose the outside patio, since the weather was perfect. our waitress Nicole was courteous, knowledgeable and gave us advice on the drinks and the food. We started with spicy margarita, fresh lime juice, good tequila, agava and a dash of jalepeno. Yummi - but be careful, they are strong! We shared an appetizer of Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze - excellent. For dinner I had the Grouper, which was a near perfect 10. My friend had Salmon which was great as well. We enjoyed some white wine from Austria - great recommendation by Nicole. The one thing we did not eat, but wished we did, was the table side guacamole. Oh well next time, since I will be back for sure.",

My husband was getting over a cold and we needed to be careful about how we shared dishes, so we took the server up on her offer to have the corn served off the cob. That was probably the way to go with this dish as it was creamy, flavorful and super easy to share. There's no way anyone sane would pass this menu item up.  The duck empanadas were good -- the portion was massive for an appetizer item, so good value there. One of the sauces on the plate was too sweet but easily avoided in favor of the more preferred alternate sauce.  We also ordered the salmon entree that was an extremely appropriate serving size. Not \"tapas\" small but not generous enough to take home -- which we appreciate considering the ridiculous portioning Americans have become used to...  Lastly, the bread pudding was fantastic. The pepitas and pomegranate seeds gave just enough texture and acidity to round it out. So yum.   Service = friendly, attentive and prompt. Only bad side was being seated next to the water & plates/flatware station which is always distracting...maybe they should just remove that table from the floor so no diners need to feel they're in the way of the staff.",

Being 6'3, its hard for me to have margaritas, appetizers, dinner plates on a small table especially when you are virtually almost connected to someone else dinner party.  To make matter worse, they seated a part of 4 bros that evidently had to much to drink and the 5'2 ginger that resembled Donny Bonaduce kept making douchebag comments at my girl.

The dining area was pretty dark, but I later realized it was because we were outside and our eyes needed time to adjust.  I loved the black chandeliers everywhere.  Very lively atmosphere.  I started off with the Watermelon Basil mojito.  Very refreshing!  The table next to us had ordered the tableside guacamole so although we had chips, salsa and guacamole for a snack earlier in the day, we had to get some.   We ordered medium spice and it had a good kick to it.  They do make it in front of you and for 2 people, it was a whole lot of guacamole!    For appetizers, we ordered the Duck Confit Empanadas, which ended up sounding better than it tasted.  It was not the pie crust dough like most empanadas.  Instead, it was like crispy wontons.  The crust was overcooked and it came with a sweet sauce so I felt like I was eating Chinese food instead of Latin American.  That was a disappointment!  By then, we were pretty full so although we ordered two types of tacos, we ended up canceling one.  We just had the Mahi Mahi tacos which were Tecata battered with a nice sauce.  It came with 3 street size tacos.  It was delicious.  The table next to us ordered the Pork Shoulder tacos which serves for 2.  That looked good as well as it came with a whole chunk of braised pork.  If we were hungry, we would have ordered that.    Overall, service was great.  Enjoyed most of the food and drinks.  If it wasn't for the duck empanadas, I would have given them 5 stars.",

Last night my dining experience was sub par. The server waited on the two tables next to us but we were there at least 15 minutes prior to those guests arriving.   Before I go on to set the stage, I am a parent and understand the challenges when attempting to bring a baby to a place to dine.   I usually get seated in the same table that I am always seated at, the tables are pretty close together so sometimes folks can bump your table spilling drinks. This happened twice last night. It happens, no big deal. The problem last night was that there was a family at the front of the place. This family had a infant that had a ear piercing scream and the child screamed a lot, so much so that everyone around was just staring at each other. Again, I understand the challenges of having a child but it is up to the staff at The Mission to make sure that the environment for the guests is enjoyable. Clearly this was not the case from 9:15 to 10:00 last night as many folks finished their meals as quick as possible to get out as did myself and my date. Maybe i am being a jerk but I think I would expect this from Chile's or Olive garden but not The Mission.",

A lot of bold flavors on a 3-shrimp skewer, do not skip it! Chorizo Porchetta - A very rich dish for my taste, as it was recommended by our waiter. A big piece of pork shoulder had probably 35% of fat on a bed of chorizo, I got full after finishing barely half of it. If you have a big appetite, give it a shot Malbec Braised Short rib - the guys finished this without any left, i guess this is enough said. Espresso churro with milk shake - This is such a cute dessert, perfect to share for 3 people. Milk shake was good, though I didn't think the churro was flavorful enough as it called 'espresso churro', and they were quite oily.   Overall our experience was great, every single dish was prepared well with very nice presentation, I call them photogenic kind of dish. Service was great, high noisy level and dark, very dark....",

I do not recommend ordering the side of \"pureed\" beans.  I've had better, more flavorful refried beans out of a can of Rosarita.  Definitely did not live up to the hype.  The atmosphere was extremely loud if you are inside, and incompatible with the fine dining menu.  To top everything off, the manager called our group after we left to tell us that tip was not included.  Apparently, the server hadn't gone through all the receipts yet and seen that we had left all the tip on one credit card.  Here's a tip, manager at the Mission, double check that there is no tip left before you CALL your customer and ask where the tip is.",

This was our first time in the Mission and we were delighted by how classy and warm the place was.  They have a very unique white Christmas tree and had a beautifully lit wreath towards the back of the restaurant.  Our Server was very knowledgeable about the food and was patient with us in going through it.  We all loved our food.  Even the desserts were amazing.  Will be back for sure, and will recommend to all my friends.",

Lamb ribs were very flavorful and plated very attractively.  The Duck Empenades were very filling.  Service was second to none. Good food, excellent service made for a great dining experience.",

Not only did I get to enjoy a nicely decorated and well designed place but I also had the pleasure of enjoying the taste of Mexican food without the heaviness that usually is accompanied. The appetizer I started with was the guacamole which might I add was made fresh and table side exactly the way YOU want it. The customer service was wonderful which is something that can make or break a persons visit. So if your tired of the same 'ol heavy traditional Mexican food, you should definitely try this place I'm sure you will find yourself a new favorite Mexican restaurant.",

The outside of the restaurant reminds me of the alamo in San Antonio, TX.  We had the skirt steak street tacos, street corn, crab and corn pancakes, and the banana and blueberry pancakes.  It was brunch on a Sunday of course!  All the food was superb!  Skirt streak came in 3 small tacos, but was very filling.  Skirt steak itself was so tender and not chewy!  Crab and corn pancakes reminded us of the crab salad at zinc bistro and find out later both are owned by the same person! Win win!  Lots of fresh crab on top of corn pancakes!  The street corn was amazing!!!  We asked the server to cut it off the husk and it was made with some sort of sauce that had a huge kick!!! It was crunchy and sweet and then spicy from the sauce!  My husband and I still cannot stop thinking about it!!  I have no idea what was in that sauce!  The children had banana and blueberry pancakes! So yummy! The bananas were fried and caramelized! This place rocks and it is so affordable!! We can't wait to go back!",

The hostess was reluctant to sit us on the patio, perhaps because we mentioned we may not be ordering dinner. That is fair, I can understand keeping the premium sitting open for larger parties or people certain to order entrees. So we took at seat at the bar. The place looked really nice and I was impressed by the selection of premium booze behind the bar.  Unfortunately we never got a chance to experience The Mission. After sitting at the bar for somewhere between 5 and 10 Mins we were yet to be acknowledged.  All the while staff is busy swirling around us. So when we decided that the Mission did not want our patronage, we got up and left after never being spoken too.  Then the hostess who sat us at the bar just 10 mins prior gave us a big smile as we left and said, \"Come back again\".  Not likely friend. I guess my money is not good enough for The Misson. I give it two stars simply because everyone else's plate looked good.",

One thing I don't like is the sort of \"club\" feel here. Its nice they want to be sexy, but Scottsdale has a lot of sex, sometimes you just want substance. Last time we were there, we went for my mother's birthday. She is a pretty hot 60+ lady, but the waitress was sort of busting out of her bra (which was busting out of her shirt) A little too much for my taste, keep it classy- we're not in Vegas. AND you're a restaurant connected to a church. It sort of ruins the quasi romantic atmosphere. I also think the seating is a bit cramped for dinner seating, this isn't Pei Wei folks. BUT if you haven't been, give it a try, its  definitely a great spot for all the GOOD reasons I've listed above.",

    "text": "Every aspect of The Mission lived up to the Republic's 4.5 star review. I absolutely loved the atmosphere, with the dim lighting of different chandeliers and the lit bar area. Service was wonderful, as well - friendly and prompt. We decided to follow the advice from Seftel's review and skip the overpriced items like guacamole and tacos, instead focusing on The Mission's more unique dishes. We started off with the absolutely amazing almejas al vapor - clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, and more in a delicate but pungent broth with grilled bread to soak it up with. For entrees, the swordfish veracruz and the scallop dish both were fantastic. The Mission fries - sweet potato and regular - were the best I've had in the Valley, topping the sweet potato fries at Delux. Typically, Latin restaurants disappoint where dessert is involved, but The Mission is an exception - the pumpkin bread pudding with scotch, caramel, pomegranate, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream was WOW-worthy. I hope this place is here for the long-haul, because we could use more unique restaurants that fill an open niche (in this case, haute Latin American).  TIP 1: Skip the overpriced guacamole, unless you have a party of 4+, and the tiny-portioned tacos.  TIP 2: You might hesitate to order fries at a Latin restaurant, but that would be a mistake. The portion is enough for 4+, and they might possibly be the best fries in the Valley.",

It will be the last.  The food was delicious and I have no complaints about the atmosphere.  However, the service was NOT enjoyable.  We sat at 9:45pm and were greeted by Jamal and Isaac. Both were extremely gracious.  Our server told us he would give us some time to look over the menu and come back for our drink order.  About 30 seconds later, we were greeted by a new server to which I responded, \" I think we already have a server.\"  She replied that they work as a team and she would take care of us.  Fair enough.  We ordered the Crispy Pork appetizer and the server immediately asked if we wanted to add 'one more pork' to the dish so my girlfriend and I would each have two.  I agreed, thinking the portion was so small it would be necessary.  In reality, there is no need to super size the Crispy Pork app.  Very shortly after ordering the appetizer, the server asked if we were ready to order entrees as the kitchen would be closing in 5 minutes.  I told her I needed a bit more time as I was under the impression the kitchen closed at 11pm (the hours on Yelp are listed as 11am-11pm).  She did not seem to buy my explanation and I then understood why she seemed so annoyed.  I would not have come in had I known the restaurant would be closing 15 minutes after I sat.  She stood at the table waiting, so my girlfriend and I just went ahead and ordered to avoid the awkwardness.  Short rib entree and Swordfish veracruz.  The appetizer and the entrees were very good.  However, less than halfway through our entrees, our server again came by and asked, \"Are you going to be ordering any dessert tonight? The kitchen will be closing soon.\"  Inside, I had actually been looking forward to dessert, but I told her we would not be indulging.  We felt as though we were a nuisance and our server wanted nothing more than for us to finish up.  Overall, the service was insincere and hurried.  I will not be back and I will no longer recommend The Mission to people visiting the valley.",

The drinks were amazing too - we ordered the special margarita and bloody mary and they were both great.  What I wasn't so happy about was the treatment by the hostess.  We had a reservation at 8PM and didn't get seated until 9:30PM.  No offer to comp our drinks or an appetizer, no apology.  We were so hungry were were about ready to leave.  For that I felt like the hostess should get fired.  But I must say the food was worth the wait.",

There were lots of candles, big mirrors on the walls, and chandeliers.  I think the waitstaff was the one downer from the visit -- they were cold and did not try to provide a pleasant experience.  Overall, I just did not think The Mission was anything special.  It's a dime in a dozen in Scottsdale.",

It is a beautiful restaurant and was packed on the Thursday night that we were there.  We had an excellent waitress who really explained the entire menu and we chose to go the small plates route and were very happy with what we ordered.  The dish we all loved was their Grilled Street Corn with a delicious aioli sauce.  It was outstanding. We also had a grilled prawn salad, smoked Swordfish, Guacamole and chips, and one other dish that escapes me right now.  All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting. I would definitely go there again.",

I almost choked when the manager told me that because of the small kitchen he can only put out 5 plates every 15 minutes..Huh?....the dining room is way too big for the incredibly small kitchen... so, because of that, do NOT walk in without a reservation...even then you will still have to wait because of the small kitchen that will get backed up and cause everyone in the restaurant to have to wait way longer than they should for their meal to arrive at their table...maybe if they made the kitchen larger so it matches the size of the dining room, people could be seated on time and not be made to wait for 30 to 45 minutes at a time....until they expand the size of the kitchen, I will NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone and will always tell everyone I know NOT to go to this restaurant.....",

They were half the size of what I would get at a taco truck in Seattle and didn't even come with a side of rice or beans, as one would expect for what I assumed would be an entree.  My BF got a salad that neither of us enjoyed.  For the price of food and drinks, this was a major disappointment.  Give me Chipotle any day over the Mission.  I guess I was expecting more since we have a Mission in Seattle that serves really great food so I had high hopes.  Big mistake!",

Dark, noisy: noise due to music too loud & people talking louder to be heard. Quite the din, because it is a small space.   Needed my phone flashlight to see the menu. Too dark is not for me. This does nothing for the ambience and gives me a feeling that there is something to hide. Perhaps $12 guacamole. That's one expensive avocado!   I only ordered a salad and the \"tacos\". Mahi mahi that was mehi meh. The only peeps at my table who ordered entrees, were my two brothers. Meat eaters. They said their chorizo whateveritwas was good. Nothing on the plate as a side. I guess I just don't get it. Rent must be really high, and of course it is a \"cool\" location. So now I've tried it, but it was completely unmemorable.   If you like to sit in the dark, eat expensive and just \"ok\" food because you're a Scottsdale hipster, then this is the place for you. I was just pleased to have exited the loud \"tomb\" when all was said & done. It's just no big deal.",

I mean, we like subdued lighting in a bar, but this place prides itself on its food -- which, for Mexican, is not cheap -- so you'd kinda like to see the plating. Moreover, it really sucks to be presented with a dish that has multiple elements, and then not be able to see what's what without a flashlight....hmm, is that julienned item a piece of apple, a piece of zucchini, or something else entirely?  No joke -- throughout the meal, I had to put down my knife and fork, and scan my plate with the tiny flashlight the manager handed out, so I could see where to cut the meat off the duck leg I was eating. I'm not making this up...when we asked to up the lights a bit, the manager came by and told us he couldn't do that, but he could give us each a tiny flashlight!  Since the place is right next to the SCPA, it's convenient for a pre-performance meal, so we may be back when it's a little cooler and we can sit outdoors where there's some light. But it's not 5-star dining, so we won't go out of our way to return.",

I understand sometimes its a bit overwhelming trying to cater to a big group (8 of us) but it literally took over 10 minutes to get our first round of drinks. We immediately ordered the guacamole and chips for appetizers.  I really enjoy their table side guac all the time as a starter. I would have wanted it much spicier, but I am not sure how much the rest of my guests would of appreciated that. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. Yes, they are very small, but they definitely filled me up. Cooked to perfection always. The wine we ordered also complemented the meal. My friend ordered the street corn. WOW, I never knew corn could taste so good. I've been to Mission many times and I cannot believe I never ordered it.  This place is definitely a date night spot with beautiful dim lighting. I would highly recommend to make reservations.",

It started off great with a round of margaritas and we ordered the tableside guacamole.  The guacamole was delicious and we enjoyed the tableside service.  Our server Timo took our order 2 out of the 3 Pig-Out which was all you can eat pork tacos, I ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp tacos.  We also ordered three sides for the table to share the black bean puree, papas y chorizo, and street corn.  We waited, and waited for my tacos to get their.  Our server keep saying that they could get their pork tacos but they wanted to wait for the whole order to arrive.  Well, after 45 minutes of waiting we finally had enough.  My Fiance' went to the kitchen to see what was going on with our order.  Our server said that it would be right out, well 10 minutes later my tacos arrived but no sides so we had to cancel those because frankly we had waited 55 minutes for 3 small street tacos - ridiculous!  No Manager ever came by to apologize for the lack in service.  As for the food, it was okay, besides the guacamole nothing that would make up for the lack of service.  With so many great Mexican restaurants this is really a shame because after reading the reviews it sounded like a fantastic place.",

It was a bit too cold for outside, so we opted for indoor seating. It was packed on a Monday night! We put our name down and was told it could be up to an hour wait. The high-top table in the bar looked so inviting that we decided to eat there instead. It gave us a nice view of the place, which had wonderful chandeliers set low over the dining tables. The overall feel was intimate and romantic, with a rockstar edge.  The waitress was phenomenal. Extremely knowledgeable about the menu and passionate about the restaurant. I was thoroughly impressed. Service was excellent.  We ordered their award-winning Blood Orange margarita and the guac to start with. A guy came to the table and made the guac right in front of us. It was a nice touch, but I wish the experience was more interactive. He didn't ask us anything beyond how spicy we wanted it. Other Yelpers rave about the guac. It's okay. :)  For our main dish, we shared the mahi mahi tacos and the pork shoulder. The mahi mahi was perfectly fried. I found myself wanting a sauce of some kind on the tacos. I ended up adding the sweet BBQ sauce from the pork dish. Not the ideal combo, but it worked! The pork dish looked amazing. My companions said the meat was very moist and the self-built tacos were delicious.   We also ordered the Grilled Street Corn and Black Bean Puree. The street corn is a corn on the cob topped with a rich, spicy, creamy sauce. It was the favorite for all of us. Very, very good. The black bean puree also packed some heat and was tasty.   We were too full for dessert, and so we waddled away, happy and content.",

    "text": "So, my beloved boyfriend had suggested this place one night for dinner and I love trying new things. The ambiance is dim lit and Spanish styled. Lit with many candles and chandeliers, this restaurant exudes a sense of exotic culinary romance. The mosaic brick-tiled accent wall is a nice touch as well.  The staff here seemed knowledgeable but a bit robotic for my taste. I prefer the conversation between server and servee to be organic. Aside from that, to begin, we ordered a bottle of the El Coto Rioja Crianza 2007. After taking our time to enjoy some conversation and the wine, we then moved on to the table side mixed guacamole. While delicious, it is kinda pricy and most definitely worth your calories for the whole week! Ha  We were given chips and salsa along with their tasty house made guacamole. The salsa they give you with the chips was super disappointing. I felt like we were dipping our chips into a bowl of cheap store bought watered down tomato sauce. I know that sounds pretty harsh but for this venue, they should know better. It is what it is.  We then chose an appetizer to continue our culinary experience. We shared the Colorado lamb with the rice and lamb chirizo. It was very impressive in both presentation and flavor profile. I was blown away at how the flavors paired so well with one and other. Simple ingredients which are prepared correctly in order to allow the natural flavors to come through are the best, I think. I almost felt that instead of ordering an entree, we should of just had more of this delicious lamb dish!  We did agree upon an entree that we both thought intriguing: the Chirizo Porchetta (pork shoulder, chorizo, fresh rosemary, cotija, white bean puree, sweet garlic crema w/chirizo gastrique). It was pretty tasty, however, we both agreed that the pork was a bit dry. I do believe that it either was not basted properly or it was just over done a bit. Regardless, the essence and aromas present were amazing.  To summarize, atmosphere is a 5, cleanliness 5, food/wine 4, service 3/4 and yes I would recommend this place to others.",

The mission was packed on a Saturday night, ambiance is dark and I guess you could say sexy (as I heard the table next to us saying).  Our waitress was attentive and made recommendations as we requested.    Guacamole- this is made fresh and right next to your table.  I thought this was good and full of flavor, different than other guacs I'm used to bc this one had a bunch of stuff mixed into it.  My hubby though thought this was ok since he prefers simple guac of just the avocado, cilantro, lime and onions.  So just depends on your preference.  Almejas al vapor- some sort of clam and shrimp stew.  We ordered this bc it was recommended.  I love salty food and this was waaaay too salty, not even good salty.  Our waitress was nice about it and took it back, later she said the chef agreed it was too salty and apologized.  What was even classy of them is they took it off our tab and gave us a free dessert.  I don't remember the name of the dessert but it was yummy, the best thing we ate here besides the corn.  Grilled street corn- ok I don't know why we ordered this when you can get this for a buck at a swapmeet.  But it was deelish, nice and buttery.  Grilled chicken tacos- we were warned these were tiny and yup they're tiny, smaller than street tacos!   We wanted to order the short rib entree but they were sold out that night :-(    So overall, this place isn't horrible.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but we just weren't impressed and prob wouldn't go back if we were in town again.",

The atmosphere is really nice...beautifully done inside and a nice patio outside.  The service is definitely great and they'll help with recommendations.  I started with the shaved kale salad with almonds, goat cheese and blood orange, followed by the chilean salmon as my entree and haricot verts and both types of grits on the side.

    "text": "Made our first visit to The Mission a few weeks ago to celebrate our friends birthday.  Our reservation was for 8 pm and my hubby and I were about 20 minutes early.  The table wasn't quite ready yet so we had a seat in the little \"waiting area.\"  The sweet hostess brought us some cute little complimentary margarita tasters.  A nice touch I thought for waiting.  The cantelope one was nice and refreshing.    Once our table on the patio was ready we were escorted outside to the nicely lit back patio-it had a nice vibe to it.  I was pleased to find out our waiter was Sam.  I had read in other Yelpers reviews that Sam was the man.  And he was! He was very informative, checked on our table at all the right times and didn't bug us too much.  He had a great personality and made our experience even more enjoyable.  So all in all our service was top notch!  The food:  I see other people complaining-maybe they don't understand that The Mission is more of a gourmet latin american restaurant (read: smaller portions).  But that didn't bother me.  My barbacoa tacos were absolutely delicious!  Small tortillas but piled with barbacoa-just the way it should be!    We all enjoyed the tableside guacamole-made to perfection.  For my drink I had The Missionary-a perfect blend of margarita and sangria.  (I had a few of those actually).  Everyone at our table raved about the excellent food and drinks-we were all pleased.    Sam ordered a pumpkin bread pudding for my friend the birthday girl.  We ended up ordering two more as they were absolutely amazing!  I don't even like bread pudding but I do love pumpkin so I tried it.    The Mission is an ideal spot for a date night or for a nice spot to gather with friends for a special occassion.  We will be back several times in the future!",

Our server, Cole was knowledgable & attentive. His recommendations were spot on. So sorry we are just passing through since the food was so well done!! The taste was unique, not your typical Mexican fare. Grouper was cooked & seasoned to perfection, however my husband would have preferred a little larger portion. The grilled corn was my favorite!

So I had a half day at work today and decided it was the perfect day to go in for a few beers and a bite.    We started off with the grilled corn which was amazing and  full of flavor, then we had the chips and salsa which were great as well.  On to the main course I had the Almejas Al Vapor which is to DIE FOR.  Seriously one of the best soups I have had EVER.

    "text": "I went to this restaurant with 9 other girls as part of a bachelorette party weekend.  We actually picked this place based on all the Yelp reviews and now here I am writing one of my own.  First off - make a reservation and get there on time!  This place gets packed, and I can see why.  The ambiance is really nice.  Kind of laid-back, soft lighting everywhere, some pretty chandeliers and this sort of industrial look that went well with the antiquity of everything else.  Our server was AMAZING.  He took the time to go over any item on the menu and explain how it's cooked, and made great recommendations for some of our girls who were vegetarians.    Myself, I was going to order the chorizo pork shoulder but decided to get the chicken tacos instead.  I was a little worried that I'd made a mistake with that order because when the food was served, all I got was a small plate with 3 cute lil tacos.  What I didn't realize was how packed full of delicious meat those tacos were.  They were, literally, finger licking good!  All the other girls in my party loved their food, so I think I can go as far as saying most everything on the menu is delicious.  Finally, the mixed drinks are delicious, too.  They have so many tequilas, it's mind-boggling. I had one of their mojitos and it was to die for.  The bartender also hooked us up with some kind of sweet drink in a shot glass for some of us chicks who can't handle hard liquor shots.  Anyways, I highly recommend this place!",

If you are headed to the Scottsdale area, make your reservation now - they are hard to get last minute, unless you want to eat at 9:30pm.  The bar area is a bit small, but it included two large communal tables for dining so you could lucky get and snag a spot there.    My girlfriends and I shared the table-side guacamole (medium level) and crispy cola pork to start - both were fab, I felt sad when the plates were empty. The margarita's are cold, strong and made to perfection.  For dinner, we again shared.. Grilled Street Corn (off the cob) and four types of the street tacos: Butternut Squash, Chicken, Skirt Steak and Barbocoa.  We devoured every morsel on the plate.  Each dish was super flavorful and had just the right amount of heat.  Great service, atmosphere and food!

If you are starving, this would probably not be enough food for you, but perfect for a light meal. My dining companions were also pleased with their meals.

Each dish was exquisitely crafted, artistically presented, and tasted like a little bit of heaven on the palate.  We tried a range of cocktails: from the jalapeno-cucumber margarita to the strawberry lime mojito, and each one was spectacular! To top it off, the service was great (ask for Kyle).

    "text": "This 1-star review is heartbreaking for me, because I had a 5-star experience there the night before. My friend and I are both from out of town and we had a wonderful evening there, served by a very lovely and attentive female server. We convinced the other girls from our business meeting (many also from out of town) to go, and we were served by Jeff, who, from the get-go, treated us completely differently from Angelene the night before (I'm SO sorry for this review, Angelene). He was condescending (kept speaking over us), and he even rolled his eyes when one of our girls complained that her guacamole was way too spicy and asked for a re-do. (Sorry, but when something is too spicy, people can't just swallow it down even if they want to.)   The other girls were already making comments that he was coming across rude, but I didn't feel it until the end of the night when he asked us how we were all doing. I said, \"I think we're ready for the check,\" and he replied dismissively, \"I'm asking everybody.\" I'm sorry, Jeff, but I didn't realize that I wasn't part of the \"everybody.\" There was then an awful miscommunication over a guacamole charge because we were all on separate bills. I get it; it's confusing and really annoying to gather separate bills. I get it; it's not ideal and it's extra work. But what I didn't get was the combative attitude and the condescending tone from both Jeff and the manager (who kept hovering over our table in the most uncomfortable manner at the beginning of our meal) who kept demanding to know \"then where's the fourth guacamole supposed to go?\" Every time we tried to explain, we got cut off (by both of them) with \"I get it\" when they clearly didn't. There wasn't a single apology for the mix up, and our gal was so over it that she had to ask three times to just give her the check to pay for it. Another one of our ladies even had to jump in a fourth time to ask for it just to end the debacle.  What blew the lid off me was that Jeff overheard (or one of his coworkers did) one of our girls say \"no tip!\" and he came out and handed us a tirade, yelling at us, \"Just to let you know, it's really not cool to leave no tip over a guacamole and that it's not fair to not tip people who work their asses off for you.\" Guess what? We know. He was serving a table of people who work in service --many of whom were business owners-- and we live off of tips and the generosity of our clients, as well.   Note to Jeff: I was actually going to leave you a tip so that you had something to tip your busser, your bartender, and the lovely gentleman who made the tableside guacamole with. But when you decided to go off on our ENTIRE table based off of your eavesdropping of what ONE person said, I was done, and I, too, for the first time in seventeen years, didn't leave a tip either. (Sept of '99 was the last time I didn't tip.) The server was livid--I get it, but we could feel the passive aggressive condescension from the beginning, and hopefully that sheds light on our building frustration throughout the night.   Jeff asked a good question: All this for $6? Maybe The Mission, its manager, and its servers should ask themselves the same question--was it worth quibbling over $6 when you probably made $400+ at a table of 8? I've never experienced service like this. I'm sorry if your server was having a bad day, but we all saw him roll his eyes at us at the beginning of the night. We all heard every time he talked over us. And you don't dismiss a customer with \"I'm asking every one\" when she asks for the check. And when you get the bill wrong, even if it's not (you think) your fault, just say you're sorry and try to understand the situation instead of getting accusatory. We didn't even get an apology when we brought up the incorrect billing from any of the 3 people who interacted with us over it. Like I said, just a lot of getting cut off with \"I get it, but...\"   Honestly, we were all set to have a good time, but I think that he decided ahead of time that we were going to be annoying and going to cause trouble, and by acting from that set of expectations, he actually created the situation. I wish he gave us a chance, because we certainly gave him many throughout the night. And if he's still hurt about not getting a tip from me (which I hope I don't have to do ever again), it came in the form of my silence from not ripping you a new one after you ripped into us over what ONE person said.  The food is great, and the cocktails, though pricy, were tasty. I had an amazing experience being served by female servers for a small party. With parents in the restaurant industry, friends and clients in the restaurant industry, and myself working in service, I am the furthest thing from the most demanding client, but any customer can seem demanding when they won't meet you halfway and listen. We told them exactly how to split the bill, but it's hard to be clear when you get cut off with \"I get it, but...\" every time you try.",

    "text": "This is a very beautiful restaurant, awesome ambiance, great service, it's just that the food is not very good.  My wife and I flew in from Ohio and ate off the limited lunch menu, 7:30pm Ohio time was 4:30pm Arizona time, we started with the table side guacamole and chips and salsa.  I must say that this was probably the best guacamole that we have ever had, definitely get it if you end up going.  The server added pumpkin seeds, which I would have never done in a million years, the result was an added texture that was awesome.  For our main course, I got the skirt steak tacos and my wife got the Mahi-Mahi tacos, both were just ok and were very small in quantity.  The bottom line?  If you are interested in great guac, a few drinks in a hip place, and then moving on to somewhere else, go here.  If you are interested in dropping $125 and leaving hungry - eat here.",

Margaritas are $14-17?! I also saw on the menu a 22 oz ribeye for $85. Not even quality steakhouses charge that much.   - 1 star for portion size: in regards to the prices above, the guacamole we were served barely went past the rim of the bowl. Not piled up like in the pictures. 3 tacos per order and each taco could be finished in 2 bites.   -1 star for service: went on a Sunday night at 6:30 pm so understandably a bit busy. Took 5 min to get a refill of tortilla chips. After our main course was finished, waiter came by and recited items off the dessert menu. We asked to see the physical menu to see all the descriptions because we couldn't remember all that. Took 5 min to just give us the menu.   Overall, great tasting food, but restaurant thinks it is more high-class than it actually is.",

    "text": "The Mission is fine dining in the quintessential casual Arizona atmosphere. Fine dining means exceptional food with exceptional service at exceptional prices. Fine dining also often means the entrees are small but the flavor combinations and quality will be unique and worth it.   The table side quac has a few unique twists like creamy garlic, chipotle sauce, jalapenos and green peppers and pumpkin seeds but since it's table side, you can specify what you do or don't want in it. We kept the chipotle sauce out, minimized the garlic and had the red onions on the side so only my husband ate those. It was tasty and perfectly suited to us.   I had the Mahi Mahi tacos. Yes, they're tiny but the quality was high and the flavors were a unique blend that worked very well. My husband had the tecate skirt steak tacos. The steak was very tender and flavorful. We would both order them again.   We both had water with our meal because it was hot and we felt dehydrated. As expected the water tasted fresh instead of the usual AZ \"I just licked a rock\" water that many restaurants serve. As we were paying, they were giving out their house blueberry lemonade alcoholic drink for free. I had one. Again, drinks are small and the flavor was fresh.     The bill for quac, water and 2 taco platters was about $50. I mention this not because I was surprised but because other reviewers expressed shock. We were both impressed enough with the flavor and quality of our small plates that we agreed we would come back for dinner some time, recognizing we will probably drop $100 on entrees alone, and double that if we have appetizers and dessert. As mentioned above, the service was excellent - prompt, frequent and friendly",

Unfortunately, I think all the other dishes I've tried are mediocre.  I had the pork shoulder (Chorizo Porchetta) which the server said was the best on the menu. I didn't like it, as it didn't really mesh well with the chorizo. The pork itself was dry. The beans on the side however, were good. I tried my sister's dish (halibut) which was dry and bland. She had to ask for sauce to give it some taste. I've had the Malbec Braised Shortrib before which I remember was pretty  average as well.   I would definitely be back, because I love the ambiance of this place. It's the perfect spot for drinks/tacos before heading out to old town or for a romantic date. The service is good and I've always had a great experience here.",

Then a little while later there was an appetizer brought to our table that we didn't order (not usually a big deal but will come in to play later on). What was not brought to our table was chips and salsa. Something that everyone else got as they sat down (but we never received). After more waiting someone else brought us our food. The food was so-so. For the price, it's definitely not worth it. A few times while eating our waiter came out to our area and just looked around without checking on us. As time went by we over heard that other tables were also getting mixed up orders. Finally once our check came to the table, they charged us for two sodas and that appetizer. The bill with my card was sitting there for a while, but since the waiter was MIA, the manager took it. I let her know that the app was added, which it shouldn't, we were charged for two sodas (when we ordered one), and that we never got chips and salsa. She did take off the app, but not the extra soda or had any other compensation for the lack of chips and poor service. All in all I do not recommend this place. It's not worth it.",

We sat in the outdoor patio which was glowing with twinkling lights and white table cloths draped the tables. I also appreciated that there was plenty of air to keep you cool on a hot August desert night.   The True flavoring and fresh ingredients were so mouth watering and unique that it continued to impress at every bite. The smells, the textures, the surprise at every dish was truly an experience.

The interior is beautiful - the inside portion is slightly dark and romantic, while the outside areas are a shaded and well-ventilated, with some modern white decor. Definitely made me feel like I was escaping to somewhere exotic.  The drinks. Oh man. First off, try the aguacate. Yes, it has avocado, but as per the waiter, the avocado just makes it creamy and masks the taste of alcohol.  Really good. I got the Elderflower Paloma - tequila, grapefruit juice, and my fave St. Germain.   We ordered the \"Tableside Guac.\" It's a bit of a cool experience, when it comes to freshly made guacamole. Is it bougie as hell? You bet! But it was delicious chunky guac.  The service was great - we were a party of 9, so I was glad that we got seated quickly (it was Monday after lunch though), and that the staff was attentive but not overly bothersome, you know? And thank you for being willing to split the food-I split the chicken torta, while another friend split the Aguacate, and the restaurant was very willing to do that.",

Ate it down to the bone. Shout out to the chef of The Mission. He needs a raise for sure. Being from New York my fiance and me we like to think we're hard critics of food since New York is so competitive with food. This blows every Mexican restaurant in New York out of the water.",

They have tableside guacamole that was so delicious and fresh, the only negative is that it was in a smaller vessel than we expected. We were hoping for more of a vat than a small bowl but it was sooo good. Our waiter was great to talk to and the staff apologized for the drunkards next to us whom we all expected to be on the floor before they finished their meals but they somehow made it through and got us drinks too to apologize - not sure if this was suggested to them or not but we didn't complain bec eating next to drunk people while on vacation is better than being at work any day so we didn't care. We had the salmon and swordfish, may sound boring but they were each delicious in their own ways. Upon first glance I thought the portion was small (we were starving) but it was perfect. The desserts were equally amazing. We were there on our last night otherwise we would absolutely have gone back the next night to try other things - check the menu and you'll see. Great place. I would not recommend it for a quiet conversation as it's pretty lively place.",

They also give you chips and salsa when you sit down. Loved the chips-light and airy. Salsa was also great. I ordered the green chilaquiles. The chicken was so so. Tasted a little rubbery. And my egg that was on top was overcooked-not runny and wet like I expected it to be. Overall was not my fav choice. My boyfriend got the Tecate marinated skirt steak with an egg. Steak was great and he really enjoyed it. One thing to keep in mind here is that if you get the guac, it's huge. That plus the chips and salsa really fills you up. By the time my food came, I was already half full from the guac. Just good to keep in mind when ordering. Overall a good Mexican spot with great service.",

Then after waiting a long time for 4 small tacos, they took our tacos to the wrong table so we had to wait for them to remake it. We waited 30-45 minutes, and it wasn't that busy.

Inside, it's \"shabby chic\" meets St. Mary's Basilica with votive candles burning, crystal chandeliers and whitewashed furnishings.  There are interesting and unusual seating areas throughout the dining room.  My favorite - tables near a cozy fireplace in the front courtyard - so comfortable and inviting.  The patio, where we sat was quiet and comfortable as well.  This place gets six stars for ambiance.  Service was top notch too, Tony served us and others filled in when he got pulled to another table.  The tequila and wine selection was large and varied.  We started with a few signature margaritas and mojitos.  The prices seemed reasonable based on the portion sizes we saw being distributed around the room. The menu is small but filled with interesting options from the standards to the sublime.  We began with the obligatory guacamole, made table side, and an order of Mexican street corn.  Both were uniquely flavored with unexpected ingredients (who puts pumpkin seeds in guacamole?!? - I will from now on!).    We were already getting filled up on the great chips and mole-like sauce they put on the table so we kept it light and ordered tacos for our main courses, short rib, skirt steak, mahi mahi on top of small hand made corn tortillas - loved them all.  We ordered a few sides too - papetes with chorizo and chipotle grits (unbelievable flavor and texture!).  We finished our meal with the pumpkin bread pudding and coffee, beautifully served in a French press. The bread pudding was good but in my opinion, the only part of the meal that didn't excel.  I will tell all my friends about The Mission, any trip to Scottsdale should include a visit.",

We made reservations at 7:15 and were promptly seated on the outside patio even though the place was packed. The weather was perfect and the ambience was great with the sound of Latin music and the subtle aroma of the wood smoke. We were introduced to Michelada, a small amount of lime juice in a frosted glass rimmed in salt with a lime and it complimented the Tecate that I ordered. We ordered shrimp on a stick appetizer, the wife had salmon and I ordered the flat steak filet. The food was amazing, the steak melted in your mouth and the salmon was covered in amazing sauce. The shrimp was awesome as well. The best part of this evening was the fantastic service. Our waiter Greg was superb and had a wonderful personality as well. If I could give The Mission 6 stars I would. If you are in Old Town this restaurant is a must to try.",

The dining room is beautiful; dark, tastefully decorated, and welcoming.  Our waitress was friendly and recommended some great drinks.  My girlfriend ordered the coconut margarita and I ordered the avocado margarita...both were unique and tasty, and they don't skimp out on the alcohol here.  There is also an outdoor seating area which looks perfect for those cool desert nights.    For an appetizer we ordered the tableside guacamole.  Very cool to see it actually made in front of you.  Great quality and quantity.  Perfect for two people.  Next up...our main dishes.  We ordered the kobe dog and the skirt steak tacos.  I can't begin to describe the amount of flavor that was contained in these two meals.  Unbelievably good.  Not really knowing what to expect from the kobe dog, I was pleasantly surprised when it came to the table.  Nothing better than a hot dog wrapped in bacon and covered in green chile, beans, red peppers, onions, and a delicious sauce.  The skirt steak tacos are not like the tacos you order from Taco Bell, they are beautifully prepared with avocado and cilantro, somewhat small, but very filling and overflowing with flavor.  An excellent experience at this restaurant.  Don't miss this place when traveling in Scottsdale.",

Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the nachos at Bootleggers down the block while waiting for our table. The food at the mission did not come together for any of us. I had the duck confit with mole .... It was weird. More like fried chicken with overly sweet plum sauce. The meals were a little too all over the place for my liking. Drinks were ok. Very overrated and underwhelming. \"Broken plate concepts\" for sure...",

    "text": "Decent service but terrible food! My family had high hopes after seeing 4 star reviews on Yelp! But it was a great disappointment. Restaurant itself had nice ambiance but was way too dark. We each had to hold a candle in order to read the menu.   1. Tableside Guacamole - Fresh but bland, even after we told the waiter that we wanted it spicy. We could hardly taste the lime and had to ask for extra lime wedges.  2. Duck Carnitas Empanada - a huge empanada, cut into 3 pieces. Another disappointment as it was swimming in too much sauce.  3. Chorizo Porchetta - GROSS! Dry and salty! I had a few bits and refused to eat more. I love pork (more than chicken) and I'm one of those people who hate wasting food, especially when it's pricy (Chorizo Porchetta was $26). So the fact that I refused to eat more after a few bits shows how terrible that dish was. 4. Alaskan Halibut - ok but nothing to impressive. I expect much more from a $34 dish. 5. Sangria - best part of this meal!  Waiters/waitresses were nice but the wait between guacamole and rest of the food was long, even thought it was a Monday night, after 8pm.",

There was a 45 minute wait for seating inside: we opted for the patio.  The ambiance is great in and out! I loved it!  The staff (hostess, server, busers & manager) were all VERY attentive! Service is outstanding!   I want to emphasize how AMAZING our server was!   She was so attentive to my daughter's needs: which, was a wonderful surprise seeing as it's not really a child friendly restaurant (would have never known by the star treatment our server gave her)! My daughter had a good time and enjoyed her specially made dinner at the request of our server!   Last,but not least, the food was delicious!  :)",

The Mission has both; it's in an ideal location to begin a night out on the town, and the restaurant's low lighting and sexy decor will had me feeling just as spicy as the Latin-infused fare.  My favorite dish, hands down, was a side of creamy grits with chipotle and honey. Everything was tasty, duck empanadas, pork belly pibl, guacamole, though nothing especially stood out as much as that humble side of grits mixed with perfection.  The service was a little over-attentive, but the guy was sweet and obviously trying his best. And he was Johnny-on-the-spot with the wine, so who can really complain about a few interruptions?   Sexy restaurant. Satisfying food.",

    "text": "The food and cocktails at this place are amazing - beyond comparison. I have not eaten one bad thing off of their menu. I am not a margarita person AT ALL but my friend insisted I try their primarita (essentially a skinny margarita) and it was amazing. Probably what all margaritas are supposed to taste like. I crave them.  Their guacamole is phenomenal - fresh and made right in front of you to your taste. You really can't get any better without going to Mexico and eating at at a mom and pop restaurant. The pork shoulder is great and the skirt steak is to die for. This is also a great brunch spot - the green chile chilaquiles are outstanding.   They are on the pricey end but their entrees are shareable. I love the dark, candlelit ambience. Perfect for pretty much any occasion: date night or bachelorette party.   Cautions: it seems next to impossible to get a weekend dinner reservation between 6pm and 9:30pm. I don't know if these are blocked out by default on Open Table. Your best bet is to make your reservation well in advance and call them directly. I have never been to this place as a walk-in for dinner. Service has also been hit or miss. I seem to get an excellent server or a really bad one.",

It is a lovely old-world mission style building with a warm glowing Himalayan salt wall to illuminate the dining area.  Sounds amazing.  I was sold at first site.    Service seemed accommodating and eager.  The server kept asking if we wanted shots and we all declined, it was way too early to get the birthday girl that intoxicated before dinner, right?  Food was nicely displayed, minimal portions but filling and tasty.  The server asked if we wanted dessert.  We declined.  It was time to finish our wine and think about our next destination while enjoying each others company.   Suddenly, three to four dessert plates are delivered to our table.  Hhhmm, who ordered this?  It was a big table, I assumed someone wanted to share the full course dining experience.  I didn't think to inquire further.  The server again, asks if we want to do shots.  yea, no dude.  Stop with the shots.  Not interested.  A few minutes later a tray of shots shows up....Weird!  Nobody seemed interested the last few times our server asked.  But here they are so bottoms up  The bills arrives approximately $800.  Tips included.  Wow.  Okay, we split it.  We continue to consume our drinks and talk.  Minutes later, the manager ( I assume since we hadn't been graced with his presence prior to this event)  comes to our table to encourage us to leave as the restaurant is filling and they need the table.  Really?  Are you Eff-ing kidding me.  We just dropped almost a grand and have been served a full course meal and you want us to wrap it up.    Outside we are discussing this last event and our dining experience... come to find out, no one in our party ever ordered the desserts or shots!!!  Holy server manipulating and pocket padding scandal!!!  What did I expect?  Ventured into Scottsdale. The land of taking advantage.",

Came here for lunch and was not disappointed.  I recommend starting with a tequila flight.  We went with the Anejo flight which was reasonably priced at $29.  Next we ordered the table side-prepared guacamole $12.  One of the best guacs I've experienced.  From the recommendation of our friendly and attentive waitress, Empress, I went with an order of the Pork Shoulder tacos and the Mahi Mahi tacos.  The chef excels when it comes to anything pork and it shone through with these tacos $10.  Highly recommend and I will most definitely return!",

    "text": "There's a lot to love about The Mission.  The experience comes so close to 5-star that it makes me want to nit-pick about all the tiny things that fall juuuust short so they can fix them for my next visit!  The Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth?  The Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partner's Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce would've saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor. ***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own!  The Atmosphere:  It's a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasn't sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor.  The Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).    A note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that would've won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos I've ever had! :)  Lots of wonderful food still to try here.  I will be back very soon for brunch with mom!",

We weren't your typical 6-8 top, rather 20 plus! We took over a good portion of the patio and several tables, but it was still intimate and cozy. Our prefix menu included pork belly lettuce cups, kale salad and tacos (beef, pork and chicken). The lettuce cups were a nice way to start off the meal. The salad was good, but my serving was heavy on the cheese (cream cheese? or a super mild goat), while I love love Kale, I was distracted by the clumps of cheese on my plate. The tacos delivered on flavor, yet were teeny tiny! My favorite was the beef. I found the pork a little sweet for my taste, but all were flavorful as can be! We had what seemed to be bottomless chips, salsa, guacamole and delicious margaritas! I can't fail to mention the shot of tequila with a cinnamon rim and a slice of orange. What a pairing! Something I'd never had before. I love tequila and I loved that shot. The servers made sure to keep the food and drinks flowing all evening. All in all it was a fine time and a fun meal.",

See review for all the other Mexican places I have ventured but other times it's a great experience and treat.   Meantime I decided to go out with my team and we looked forward to this awesome atmosphere and restaurant located in old town Snobsdale. We made reservations and ended up with Lauren our server for the night.  We ordered appetizers like the Guacamole and the cheese plate.  The guacamole was good but nothing beyond what other local joints can do and I was not impressed with the portion which was very small. The cheese plate was not my favorite.  We kept getting pushed to hurry and order and we were still having cocktails and waiting for another member. The server said if there was any chance we can call our friend to order her food because they needed to serve more guest?? What the French! Did we just get checked at a high end restaurant and were told to hurry up?!   By the time we got our food I was really annoyed.  Here I am bringing out my team and although I understand you have a busy place, get over yourself and make sure your hostess doesn't seat us if we don't have a party versus making such a classless move.  Foul!  The food was okay but my experience just bummed me out.  I talked to the manager, Brian and he said it was a tough balance and hoped we can understand.  We will see whether I would ever do this again.  It's not like I do this every once in a while, I'm out and about all the time.  Boo",

They said they had to wait to seat us until they had more menus. We said it was ok and that we would just sit down but they wouldn't let us. We finally sat down and they said they were going to bring us waters. So thirty minutes later we got water. We then ordered drinks and those came pretty quickly. We ordered chips and they were extremely salty but the salsa was good. The portions are very weird. We had to wait almost 1 hour for our lunch and it was interesting. The 12 dollar tacos were tiny and the 6 dollar French fries were huge! It was ok but not worth the wait. Our waiter was also very weird. He was complaining that he had to work both inside and outside so we shouldn't expect our food anytime soon. He also told us that \"this isn't  a Mexican place and you  shouldn't expect anything you would find at a Mexican place\". Which was pretty weird cause all their food is pretty much Mexican. I ordered chicken tacos with only avocados and cheese. He told me that he would bring everything even though I didn't want it. He said I had to try the bean paste and it was just a waste of food because both me and my cousin asked for no toppings! After we got the tacos we had to ask for the two things we wanted which were cheese and avocados. Instead of just bringing what we asked he insisted on putting the food we didn't want on the plate! I thought overall the food was okay but the service could definitely be improved.",

Try the butternut squash tacos. The corn side is sooo good, as is the cheesy Spanish rice. Literally cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. And the decor is fabulous-love the chandeliers.

    "text": "I don't toss around 5 stars lightly. Service has to be flawless, food has to be top notch, and the entire experience needs me to be thinking about it days later. That's what I experienced at The Mission. Broken Plate Concepts truly gets that dining out isn't just dining out--it should be an experience from start to finish.   Like it's sister restaurant, House Brasserie, the restaurant is lovely.  And it's meant to be a finer dining experience so take the time to dress up. A party ahead of us who clearly hadn't planned out their experience was informed that the young men needed to remove their baseball caps. They weren't happy about it, but I appreciate that a restaurant wants to maintain a certain level of experience for everyone.  There are 2 patios, one in front and one in rear of restaurant. Both were comfortable and calming. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and worked very hard to make our first experience memorable. We were celebrating our anniversary and she even treated us to dessert. Classy!  So, if you're coming to The Mission, you have to have the table side guacamole. It's a must have. You can have other stuff off the starters list but if you don't get the table side guacamole, you are a fool. Seriously. It's that good. They roll out a cart filled with every ingredient imaginable to create guac and literally make guacamole right at your table to your taste. It doesn't get any fresher or better than that. The chips are warm, not too salty and more importantly, sturdy! There is nothing worse than flimsy chips that break when you are scooping salsa and/or guacamole. And let me tell you, the salsa is incredible.   Husband and I both had the street tacos; he the tecate skirt steak tacos and I the roasted butternut squash tacos. Y.U.M. We went on Saturday evening...it's now Tuesday. We are STILL talking about these tacos. The skirt steak was melt in your mouth tender and the butternut squash tacos were filling and perfectly done. Nothing worse than overcooked squash. We also had the papas y chorizo and the chipotle grits for sides. Both were delicious and unique.   Our dessert was a pumpkin bread pudding that was damn near a religious experience. Ordinarily I wouldn't pick bread pudding but I am going to have to rethink that after having this ooey, gooey, chunk of heaven. The ice cream sprinkled with cayenne was a nice touch too.   We are already planning our next visit and can't wait to try more treats!",

    "text": "Best Mexican food ever created. Don't worry about the prices, your tastebuds will thank you later.  Came here my first night back in Scottsdale in a few years. The place was buzzing; we waited fifteen minutes in the gorgeous front patio area with a couple of over-priced Stella Artois. We were soon escorted to our table on the back patio.  The place was decorated beautifully and with southwestern class. Dress to impress here, but also don't fret if you're wearing shorts and a collared shirt; everyone is welcome here.  We began with table-side guacamole, which was prepared with ease and efficiency. Made with some heat to our liking; we finished it before our entrees. My girlfriend and I shared the pork shoulder tacos, which came highly recommended, with a habenero pineapple sauce, and small dishes of chopped onions, shredded cheese, and cilantro to add to the mix.   Handmade corn tortillas served on a hot Himalayan salt block, absolutely exquisite.   The do-not-miss side dish we ordered was the Peruvian Street Corn, (offered on, or off-the-cob) which came with a lime wedge to squeeze over the top. Incredible complex flavors of sweet, tangy, and savory. We started adding it to our tacos and wow, we were blown away.  For dessert we shared the pumpkin bread pudding which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and served warm; a great way to end our meal.   Our service was a little scattered, only because the place was slammed. However the food was some seriously inspired cuisine, with flavors hitting every desirable note imaginable.   I'd come back again and highly recommend this place to anyone willing to spend $75+ on an unbelievable meal for two.",

We move inside to  table close to the bar which was noisy and very busy.  We started with the table side guacamole  which was average at best. Our waitress then convince us to have the duck empanada, which was deep-fried bread with lots of sauce and little duck. It was tasteless and sat like a lump of dough in my stomach. We also were recommended to try the street corn which was gooey.  For main course i had the pork shoulder which was ok but lacking in taste.  It was actually a bit bland.  My wife had the flat iron steak which again lacked flavor.  We are frequent restaurant dinners and probably because of that have a high standard.  The Mission really was below average for us.",

    "text": "The Mission is such a fun, delicious spot! I went there for my second time on Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. We got to sit out on the back patio in the beautiful evening weather that was decorated with little white lights.   Once again I wish I remembered our server's name because he was on point. He greeted our table and shared with us some restaurant and personal favorites without missing a beat on the ingredients in each dish.  I started with the white wine sangria which was good, grapefruity in my opinion but I still liked it. Our table ordered the table side guacamole and the crispy pork & cola lime glaze as our appetizers. The table side guac is a MUST. They make it right there with about 12 ingredients (I think that's what our server said). It's fresh and creamy, just the way guac should be. The crispy pork & cola lime glaze was amazing and recommended as a restaurant favorite. It was something you can only find at the Mission, which I find important.   For my main dish, I ordered the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos and my boyfriend got the Pork Shoulder Tacos. The little corn tortillas they prepare are yummy and in house, which is awesome. My steak tacos had a nice grill smokey taste to them. They serve three small, street style tacos but they fill you up quicker than you realize. I recommend ordering a side with the tacos however. My boyfriend and I split the grilled street corn appetizer off the cob as our side. That corn might have been my most favorite dish all night. The pork shoulder was succulent and prepared perfectly.  One of the gentlemen I was with called the place \"froo-froo Mexican.\" I have to agree, it's upscale Mexican but don't let the deter you from trying it out because the flavor profiles and combinations are unique and phenomenal. Be sure to go when you're willing to spend some money so you get the full experience of The Mission!!",

But we were seated in the BAR-clearly the noisiest part of the entire building and my friend was approached in the BATHROOM (really?) by the manager and told we needed to quiet down. Same manager came to our table a bit later and told us that he had received complaints about our noise level and that we needed to decide if we were going to quiet down and stay, or \"shake hands and part friends right now\". WOW-pretentious much???

You must try the guacamole prepared at your table.  It was fantastic!   The waiter preparing it puts on quite a show as he describes each ingredient before blending it together with a giant mortar and pestle.   The street tacos were delicious, the sandwiches filling and served on fresh homemade bread.  There's a nice patio in the back and on the street in front.  Inside dining is lit like a confessional but allows for a more intimate dining experience.  The waiters are friendly and knowledgeable and will guide you through this upscale creative Mexican experience.  This is not your momma's Mexican food!",

Each dish is unique and delicious. For example, the pork belly tacos are served with the pork and sauce in a cast iron skillet and the hand made soft taco shells are served warm on a salt block. Yummy!  The salads are amazing too. If you're up for a Margarita, their house variety may be the best in the valley, although a little pricey. For those looking for a \"happy hour\", you won't find it here. As for the food price, I find it reasonable for the quality and quantity served.

I had no idea where he was going but he said that he knew because his Google map told him so. I passed by the Mission, it looked busy and crowded, and there was no seating so we put our names down. It was not what he had intended, but he said, it looked really good. I don't know much about anything except for I was being led, a role I very rarely played, but there was a sense of freedom of letting go of your control, I often controlled where what when how to eat but not with him.   We pivoted back to this same spot, he could not find the original restaurant he intended to go. His Google map led him stray. There was still a 45 minute wait. But the bar area was open seating, just then, it opened up. Two seats. Both of us are left handed, bar seating has been his favorite, because he said that then we could talk, he did not have to feel sitting too far from me. When I eat I did not like to talk. I take my food seriously and talking just seemed to be in conflict with the main purpose of eating. Still, we did not want to wait as we were hungry.  The bartender offered us a menu for food and a menu for drinks. He ordered wine and I scanned the menu. Not knowing what to order I told him to decide. He sought advice from the bartender and he gave several suggestions. We settled on two different types of fancy street tacos and duck empanadas. Two drinks, three things, perfect balance and extremely good portioned. He liked, no, loved ducks. We ate either sushi or duck, I've known this man for nearly 20 years, and still he had not changed.  The restaurant is wildly popular among locals. The festive atmosphere reminded me that famous spot in Malaga spain, right in the downtown square, where all the locals go and late into the evening  they dined and laughed and caught up their lives. As if to prove me right, the next day, while riding in Uber, the driver said, \"you went to the Mission? That's right across from Livery Stables. A good spot. A local favorite.\"   When he and I traveled together, my experience felt surreal, like he was just a figment of my imagination, and I was only talking to his shadow, visiting restaurants he would have liked to dine in, and ordering dishes he would have liked to order. Perhaps all along he was never there, and I was only the lone traveler, pretending he was with me, eating with me, loving me, until the end of the time.",

Chips and guacamole were great...we started at the bar because we arrived early for the reservation. I ordered a $14 margarita at the bartenders recommendation. It was terrible. Tasted like Cuervo mix. I sent it back and got the sangria which is good. He was nice about it, but I expected something a little more authentic, esp at that price point. When our reservation was ready we were seated outside. Smack dab facing the setting sun. Blasted in the face. I didn't ask to move (because there was probably no where to move to) but I asked how long before the sunset and was told something like \"ohhhh soon\"...obviously this restaurant is busy and not hurting for cash, so maybe don't seat customers at this particular table at sunset. We were laughing because it was so absurd. I had to scoot way over (the poor man next to me:/) to escape the blinding sun until it set about 15 min later. So next we order a bottle of wine. After we order it we're told the price is incorrectly listed on the menu. It's more $ than I wanted to spend and wouldn't have ordered it I had known. We get apps and food. Good food, but I wasn't wowed, but good. Service was ok, but again, just ok. Silverware not replaced, just moved to dirty outdoor table after plates are taken. Again, things you're fine with at your local Cheesecake Factory, things you're not fine with for a pricey meal. Anywho...the bill comes and the wine is even more than she quoted. Come on. This is basic stuff y'all. Anyway, I suspect there is better \"Mexican\" food around Scottsdale and Phoenix...you might want to think about eating elsewhere.",

Very high end southwest cuisine (no quesidillas or enchiladas in sight) go for the short ribs, filet and fried bananas (with peanut butter mousse, swoon)  and the tableside guacamole is the best I've had in my life!  In case you haven't been here before we were both exceeding impressed!",

Do you fancy dinner?  Do you fancy brunch?  You are coming to the right place but make a reservation. There is an amazing fireplace in the front patio if you want that romantic evening.  What do I recommend?  Everything!  Something unique on the menu grits! Served 2 ways sweet or spicy you choose or get them both!  And one thing not to miss the table side guac! Enjoy you will be thanking me later!",

The street tacos for two that is served on a big rock salt block are particularly good.  Be aware that as of spring of 2015 this is one of the hot spots in town and you will likely need a reservation several days in advance.  There is a large flat parking lot across the street and a garage around the corner that is free.",

It's robust flavors will make your taste buds dance with glee!  Their tacos may be small, but they have BIG flavor.  If you order tacos as your main course, be sure to add a collection of sides.  I suggest the white and black bean puree, the chipotle honey creamy grits and the street corn.  For desert, you absolutely need to order the pumpkin bread pudding.  Don't leave without ordering the pumpkin bread pudding.  I mean it!  Call ahead for a reservation because this place gets busy and you may not get a table otherwise.  Love The Mission!",

The guacamole is outstanding, we ordered two this time because it's so good.  Chips are fresh and the salsa has a wonderful tomato puree base with a medium heat.  Chicken Anticuchos were a big hit, I didn't try them but everyone at the table gave them rave reviews.  I had the butternut squash tacos, I love these the flavor is incredible.  Husband tried the Cuban sandwich this time and thought it was excellent, another at our table tried the brisket sandwich - also giving rave reviews.  One person ordered the pozole and everyone went nuts for it!  I also ordered a side of the white bean puree - if you even just kind of like beans, try this it is so delicious!!  I could have ordered three sides of this as my meal. I gave everyone a taste and I could see them waiting to pounce if I left a speck in my bowl.  There is a public lot across the street which makes parking a breeze.  The ambiance is nice, big bar with TV's, tight tables with dim lighting in the interior restaurant, nice patio seating out front.  Service has been excellent both times but the hostess staff is similar to the interior lighting - dim.  My next move is to go at night for dinner and try some margaritas.",

    "text": "Visited The Mission based on Yelp reviews when visiting Scottsdale. Upon walking in I immediately felt a sense of awe for the atmosphere was great. I loved the old chandeliers and religious themed decor. They had a nice mix of contemporary and Victorian style decor. There was only one thing that bothered me about the atmosphere - the music. I thought it wasn't appropriate for the theme of the restaurant. It was house electronic music. There could have been a deeper meaning for it but I wasn't getting it.  First we got the guac - which as hand mixed right in front of you! We agreed it was the best guac we have ever had.   I got the mahi mahi tacos and my girlfriend got the vegetarian tacos. My tacos were so so. I felt that the batter was too thick and tasteless. Mahi Mahi is generally a tasteless fish (in my opinion) so I felt it needed something to give it a kick. The tarter style sauce just wasn't cutting it. I don't think I'd recommend the Mahi Mahi.  However, the vegetable tacos were incredible. They were so sweet and flavorful. Highly recommend them. They are definitely unforgettable !   The only reason I give The Mission 4 stars was because my meal wasn't that great. I am sure there are so many items on this menu that are so awesome, like the guac and my girlfriend's tacos.",

We sat at the bar for lunch and everything was great. I had the skirt steak tacos which were absolutely delicious - I was so full but I wanted more!

I assumed it would be trendy, touristy and kinda show-offy which are 3 things I am not, but it wasn't like that at all.   We met here for dinner New Year's Day and this place was packed. We had a reservation for indoor, but decided to change it to outdoor. There was a 10 minute wait for a seat so the hostess gave us complimentary mini margaritas. There is outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant which is kinda small and intrusive so I was delighted when we were led to the back outdoor area. It was spacious and nicely decorated. There were several large heaters throughout the patio which kept us comfortable.   We started out with chips and the best salsa I've ever had....it was so good we ordered another bowl. We also got mission fries & guac. The guac was very original: avocado, cheese, onion, cilantro, tomato, lime and pumpkin seeds. It was great. I went with the pork belly lettuce wraps, 3 come in a serving. I think I died and went to heaven, I only wish I had 10 more. My husband got the chimichurri hangar steak. He asked for medium, but it was more like rare. I don't eat red meat that often and the fact that it was literally red turned me off. My brother ordered the mahi mahi tacos, 3 come in a serving. The waited suggested he order a 4th taco because they are on the small side. The tacos were fabulous. He aslo got a side of Tennessee, chipotle grits. They were creamy, smoky and yummy.  This is the first meal since moving to Phoenix that I really enjoyed. I wish I had more of everything.   A shout out to Sal, our wonderful waiter. We will be back.",

Besides the appetizers I tried the mahi tacos and they were great, baja style, but very, very lightly breaded and fried. We also had the please of trying mini-churros with a milkshake (mmmmmmm), fried bananas, and bread pudding. I'm not a fan of bananas or bread pudding so I'm not a good judge of if they were good or not, but the rest of my table assured me they were.  I also really dig the interior of The Mission. It sort of reminds me of the Alamo, although I only ever went to The Alamo once many years ago so my memories could be wrong. However, it has that open, cool, stone feel with tons of great chandeliers and candles hanging around and setting the mood. So, um, check it out and get into the mood.",

    "text": "In an actual Mission, this place exudes Latin cuisine! Based out of old town (not so much the bar scene area, but real old town), The Mission is all that and so much more. They do get packed almost any night of the week, so make sure to place a res! We had a group of 10 coming in on a Wednesday night, getting a res was hard enough. We had put it in online, but yet, had called and they said there was nothing on their list. Alas, we came in anyways and they had a table for us on the patio, it all worked out!   The food, don't even get me started...this charming restaurant serves just the right amount of dishes to share amongst a group, I love how they serve the meat in a dish along with ten homemade tortillas for two. Their pork shoulder and lamb came in a cast iron skillet...the meat fell right off, juicy, tender, fresh, hot...I can go on and on! The sweet, almost mole like, sauce that the pork came in was some of the best I've ever had! They provide you with a lot of sauces and sides for everything as well. We ordered, literally, every single side on the menu along with quite a few apps. Their grits (to die for), a huge basket of sweet potato and regular fries, rice, street corn, duck empanadas (the meat was perfectly cooked inside, not dry at all), shrimp and beef sticks were all amazing! Hands down, some of the best Latin cuisine I've ever had.  Their drinks are tasty, however, the Mission (what I ordered), was a bit too sweet for me. So I will say that if you enjoy a lot of sugar and flavor in your drinks, go here and grab one. Our server, a nice gentleman, was patient and kind with us. With how loud and rowdy we were, he really took his time! Constantly came around to fill our waters, very attentive. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is for the fact that they didn't note our res and that a few items were forgotten when we ordered and the women servers didn't seem happy and were super rushed. But for food, 5 stars hands down! Enjoy while in Scottsdale!",

I highly recommend a visit here when in Scottsdale. High quality food. Great service. My only challenge was two things. It is so busy that we ended up in a two top sandwiched close between two other tables which can make an intimate conversation awkward. Something you deal with in big cities or popular restaurants. My only other challenge was that we could not see the menu because I am old and can not see in the dark. I had to turn on my phone light which was potentially disruptive to other guests. I wonder if they could give older guests a small flash light as they are going over the menu. But I loved the ambiance so it was worth it and sorry to other guests I'd do it again because of the incredible food. I have the pork..a must have. It was perfect and the flavor was incredible!",

A perfect service team in general with an on floor manager on the ball as well. You can tell this restaurant is very well run.   An amazing splurge.",

BUT  This last trip was terrible on the service side.  We complained about the taco shells as it looked like someone took a bite out of the food (pork shoulder).  We showed the server and showed the manager and both acted like we were morons.  Even a laugh along with an admission that it was weird would have worked.  Throw us a few new shells and we would be sated.  Instead we gave a sub standard tip.  AND  Then my wife gets a voicemail from the server asking why the tip was low.  Seriously?  We told you when we were there pal.  End of the trips to The Mission for us, we don't accept being treated that way, unacceptable.",

Had table-side guacamole with their fantastic, light and tasty chips.  The salsa is smokey and flavorful. I opted for the tostadas.  You get 3 and they were plenty for a full meal for me.  I like the crispy tortilla bottom over standard street tacos and they were done perfectly.  A nice little kick with the chipotle crema on top and they were yummy!  Our table shared a few sides as well that were all good.  The street corn with the same crema that they kindly cut off the cob for us.  The black bean side was my fav.  So delish!  Friends did a variety of tacos, fish and meat and all were enjoyed.  Definitely a stop you need to make when visiting Old Town, however, it's clearly not the only great restaurant there.  Wow there are so many!!",

FOOD Table side Guacamole (5 stars): Really good! The guacamole is very flavorful, perfect mix of ingredients. We had to order a second cause it was so good.   Chips and Salsa (5 stars): The chips are freshly made and perfectly thin. Salsa is really good.   Street Corn (4.5 stars): Another good dip.   Clam Soup (4.5 stars): The bread it comes with is so moist and buttery. This was like a Mexican clam chowder, has a good kick so make sure you can take the heat.   Huevos Rancheros (4 stars): I did like this but I liked the red sauce on the chilaquiles better.   Red Chilaquiles (5 stars): The red sauce is SO GOOD! Get this! The pork is also so moist.   Cinnamon Pecan Maple Waffles (4 stars): A great sweet dish to have.   SERVICE (5 stars) Amazing service. Always checked on us. Really Mary our experience great.  ATMOSPHERE (5 stars) Beautiful chandeliers inside. A more romantic vibe inside while the outside patio is more casual. The bathroom was clean and smelled good with their pumpkin spiced candle.   PARKING There's a parking lot right across the street, very easy.   Thank you to the owner, Brian, for making sure we had a great experience for my bachelorette weekend. I highly recommend coming here for great homemade Mexican food that won't disappoint!",

I ordered the sword fish and it was pretty dry with not a lot of flavor. It wasn't worth its price and it really bothers me.   I would have flagged down my waiter, but from the get go he had kind of a bad attitude. Didnt like that the older people I was dinning with were asking so many questions, almost came off as snobbery. Was very disappointed with that.   Dont think I'll ever come back here, not for the quality of food you get for your money or for the attitude of our waiter.  Customer service is very important when people are paying close to $200 in your store.",

Came here late afternoon for a light snack/meal.  I had one of the most delightful and flavorful bowl of pozole here! I was willing to eat that in 110 degree weather. But it was worth every spoonful.  As listed on the menu: Red chile, smoked pork, hominy, avocado, lime & corn tortilla strips  They slow cook the pork for hours until perfect. And I like how the tortilla chips are nice light and thin crispy strips of crunchiness - just right!  So that was that on the one dish.   Years ago when I came for dinner, all I remember was their savory duck empanadas. This is what made me wanting to go back and not sure why I haven't been since.   One thing I didn't like years ago was trying to enjoy a date night and had to share it with the other 2 couples on each side next to us. The tables were practically divided by as much as you could fit your legs through. So it was like you had an eavesdropper or you had to compete talking louder. And even worse was the couple that made silence golden to awkward because the girl was crying - obviously a couples fight.   But other than that, the food and service is definitely worth coming back for!!",

But after sampling the stew at  Yelp in Bloom, he was open to giving it another shot.  And this time, it did not disappoint either of us.  I have to give 5 stars for the Primarita.  I was hesitant given it has something like half the calories of a standard margarita.  Half the calories and twice as good!  A couple of these and I can almost forgive the price of the guacamole.  After Yelp in Bloom, we had to order the Almejas Al Vapor, that delightfully spicy peruvian stew.  Definitely enough for two and served with plenty of bread to soak up all that broth.  That tends to help keep patrons from drinking from their bowl I'm sure.  We also tried the tostadas prepared with chicken thigh and black beans.  Delicious, but maybe piled just a little too high.  More stuff ended up on my plate than in my mouth with every bite.  Maybe they should line the plate with a tortilla so I could just roll up all the stragglers at the end.  Less forks to wash that way, too.  The grilled street corn was right up there on the good scale with everything else, as well.  Only knocking a star off because everything really is priced just a bit too high IMO.  But this time, I'm sure we'll be back!",

My fiance and I each got a couple margaritas, we split the table side guacamole then ended with the pork shoulder for two. We ate about half of the entree due to filling up on  the guacamole. The guacamole is a must, it's easily the best I've ever had, plus it's fun watching it being made. The margaritas were just ok. The pork tacos were fantastic and a ton of food. We liked it so much, we made another reservation as we were leaving. This past weekend I took my fiance, and future mother and sister in law. The food was good but the portion sizes were inconsistent with our first visit. Also, we paid 100 bucks for 4 drinks, table side guacamole and tacos for two. The food and decor is great. It's really tough to beat. The place is fairly small so you need to get a reservation well in advance, we made many attempts to get a table before we finally went.",

We're in town with friends for a little R&R when a chef at another restuarant, also excellent, suggested this place among 10 or so others.  This food is AWESOME!  We started with margaritas: she had the pear basil, I the Aguacate.  I thought hers was sweet but tasty; mine was out-of-the-ballpark fantastic.  So good, in fact, that my wife got a second margarita, an Aguacate.  It's loaded with avacado -- yes, avocado!  Weird, but really good!  You MUST try this one.  Then we went on to a grilled street corn appetizer.   Fantastic!  We had it off the cob (easier to share).  It had a sort of chipotle aioli, which I guess was the chile paprika, with butter, cilantro, and cotija.  Then came my brisket torta:  smoked brisket, habanero, barbeque, aji amarillo, coleslaw, yucca bread.  I love this place!  My wife had the butternut squash tacos -- and I really didn't think any non-vegetarian could get this excited about a vegetarian dish!  Superb!  We tried the sweet honey chipotle grits as a side, which I thought were too sweet, but interesting, and we tried the Mission fries, a mix of sweet and regular fries with seasoning, lime, and chipotle ketchup or aji amarillo.   The damages with all of the above (total 4 margaritas) came to $86.00, sans tip.  The service was wonderful -- thanks Simona!  Lots of other cool selections.  Had I room for more I would be telling you about dessert.  Until next time (tomorrow?), I continue to be your  Incognito Connossieur",

The food was amazing and so reasonably priced for the quality and presentation.  Favorites were the poblano grits, the white bean puree, and the grilled gem salad.

    "text": "If you're looking for a restaurant hotspot in Old Town, look no further.  The Mission offers up gourmet latin-inspired creations in a dimly-lit, totally chic setting, with decor reminiscent of its days as a pueblo church.  We went on a Saturday night, and it was a good thing I made a reservation - the place was PACKED!  The bar was packed, the tables were packed, even the aisles were packed!     To eat:  *Crispy Cola Pork - Tasty, but seemed more asian than latin-inspired.  Close your eyes and you might think you're eating an extra-sweet teriyaki lettuce wrap.  *Duck Empanadas w/ Foie - Pass on this one.  The foie was strangely spongy and the empanada crust was very tough and mealy.  Filling was bland.  All around fail.  *Mahi Mahi Tacos - $14 gets you two lipstick-sized tacos with nothing on the side.  Same goes for all the taco dishes.  Very bad value.  *Shortrib Asado Negro - Meat was tender and flavorful, and there was a decent portion of it.  But there was hardly any garnish to cut it - maybe 4 small bites worth.  Why skimp on black beans, plantains, and rice that cost next to nothing?  Silly.  *Espresso Churros - Delicious!  My favorite part was the milkshake - Perfectly smooth and coffee-y.  However, the main component of this dish is supposed to be the churros and for some reason there were only a few small sticks of those.  Conclusion: The Mission has an awesome-sounding menu, but most of the actual dishes fall short.  Portions are generally very scant and uneven across menu items, so be sure to ask your server about what to expect.  The food is basically good for noshing while enjoying several cocktails, looking hot, mingling, and enjoying the upbeat vibe!",

I had to order room service after i left just to make sure i ate however i am a very picky eater so you just might like this place. Fresh guac was pretty good probably the best thing i had an im not a fan of guac so kinda strange. Right down the st from Hotel Valley Ho where i was staying i would have been better off ordering room service!!!",

    "text": "This place is so wonderful, I almost don't know where to start!  The food: Outstanding.  We started with chips & salsa, guacamole, and chicken anticuchos.  The salsa was one of the best we've ever had.  The guac, made fresh tableside, was to die for.  The chips?  Homemade and still warm.  The anticuchos were perfectly seasoned, on a bed of deliciously spicy mole, and just the right portion for a starter.  We were impressed and we hadn't even gotten to the main event!  I ordered the citrus-cured Chilean salmon.  Incredible.  Also, \"huitlacoche & sweet corn puree\" does not adequately prepare one for the smoky bites of heaven that are the side dish to the slightly caramelized fish.  My boyfriend ordered the chorizo porchetta, so melt-in-your-mouth tender that you could cut it with a fork.  Everything was beautifully plated, in portion sizes that are appropriate for such rich, flavorful food.  We left no room for dessert, but we can vouch for the bar:  fantastic cocktails (Bitter Bees was a really good one), and if you're a white wine drinker, either of the albarinos are great, but the Licia was a perfect pair with the rich salmon.  The atmosphere/service:  The restaurant is gorgeous, elegantly dark with chandeliers and a glowing salt wall.  It is also very warm;  we opted to sit outdoors.  Perfect choice - we dined under the stars, next to a fireplace.  Patio heaters keep the area comfortable.  The outdoor area is mostly lit by candles, so it can be a bit dark;  our waitress gave us a small flashlight, to make menu-reading easier, without us having to ask for such a thing.  It is loud - though slightly less so outdoors than in - and the service was pretty good for how crowded it was.  We were early for our reservations, and still were seated almost immediately.  (And I was surprised how busy they were, on a Monday night, when all the other restaurants in that area of Scottsdale were dead quiet... I think it speaks to the quality of food here!)  All in all, it was a top-rate dining experience, and a perfect start to our vacation - if we lived in the area, we'd go back again and again.",

    "text": "I'll admit.... after reading so many \"stellar\" Yelp reviews, we were swayed to dine here.  We dined on a weekday evening  -- so we didn't get to experience the \"best brunch in town\" per Krashawnda N. Dang it! Now we're gonna have to go here again, after re-reading her review. :)  Hubby and I ordered:  Mahi Mahi tacos  $14 Chicken tacos   $12 Mission fries  $6 Mission Margarita  $7  Food was good... I wouldn't say \"AMAZING\"... but maybe I had the wrong expectations. First of all the tacos were shockingly smaller than expected. Three tacos per plate, and per another reviewer they truly were about 2\" across. However, they did taste divine.... (at least mine did, the chicken tacos). And honestly, now that I'm finished... any more and I would have been uncomfortably full.   But the Mahi Mahi tacos were actually battered... we were not expecting that. And the batter was a medium coat - not thin or thick. Still edible.   My margarita was definitely tasty!  I really enjoyed the ambiance.... it was definitely an upscale \"Latin American\" restaurant. Beautiful dark chandeliers, gorgeous illuminated salt block wall, dark hardwood floors...   No complaints about the service. We were greeted right away and also immediately had water served to us, when we were sat. And likewise the server was appropriately attentive.   All in all, we spent about $50 for some smaller-portioned plates -- which was more than we typically spend for dinner lately. But we had a good time.... I think it you're looking for more of a \"value\", this place might be better on the weekends for the brunch.",

We made the mistake of not making a reservation because we figured during the week we wouldn't need one (we are not from the area). We were able to sit at a table in the bar- no big deal. The table side guacamole was good- I really like when you can see whats going in it and choose what ingredients you don't want. I ordered the short rib tacos which were great. They were on the sweeter side, but not too sweet. Our waitress suggested the corn to go with my meal. It had a creamy sauce and was spicy, but I really enjoyed it. My husband got the skirt steak tacos and grits. He also really enjoyed his meal. Overall is was great food- I just felt it was a bit pricey for the amount of food you get.",

Either way, I found myself at the Mission for the first time and quite liked it.  Staff took fantastic care of us, and the food was tangy and tasty. We had the table-made guac, and I snagged some of their Fantasma (?) sauce made from Ghost peppers to spice it up. Spice it up indeed. Woo!  Mahi-Mahi tacos also had a bit of a kick, and we ordered them grilled so they were quite light.  Washed it all down with a few Agave Margaritas.  Not cheap, but well worth it. I shall be returning!",

For a brand new restaurant, you guys didn't miss a beat! Our server was personable and quick with getting us drinks. Her recommendation of the jalapeno cucumber margarita was spot on. So good!   And the food...the food is why we come. We ordered all the top choices, from the duck empanada, tostadas, street corn, crispy cola pork, tacos, wings, papas and chorizo, and dessert. UNBELIEVABLE.

Second, the rear end(butt) of the guacamole maker was beside his head(while eating) numerous times making guacamole for surrounding tables. Third, plan on repeating everything you say during conversation, the place is super loud during dinner on a Thursday night. The extremely dark setting is romantic I guess...but several phone flashlights were on to read menu and see the food about to be consumed.

If this woman truly was the manager, I am shocked they would employee such a rude and hateful woman and put her in charge of working with customers. This is the least accommodating restaurant I've ever been too. The summary here is: if you have a large party of 12 or more, don't bother coming here unless you plan on reserving through a private event and paying for the prix-fix menu, otherwise they will treat you like dirt on the ground and make your party sit in two separate tables across the patio from each other. When we *gasp* even attempted to ask the rudest manager alive if we could pull another table together that was closest to our largest table, her eyes and glare could cut glass as she very rudely said no and didn't even attempt to try to work with us. When we asked why we couldn't sit at a table similar to the TWO other large party tables next to us and why our tables couldn't have been pushed together, she harshly said how those were for \"private parties.\" Aka the people who paid their ridiculous prix-fix prices. Our reservation was for 8:15 and they didn't even seat us until close to 9, at which point tables on the patio were starting to leave and a restaurant with the slightest level of customer service would have accommodated us.   We came here for my friend's bachelorette party dinner who had read amazing reviews about this restaurant. I had been here several times over the years and never experienced such rudeness. I will never come here again and highly encourage anyone else reading this to do the same. The good food isn't worth the rudeness and snobbiness of the management. This isn't New York. This is Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in this town.    What I liked:  The food: I started with the three-bean salad, which was fantastic. It was a mixture of fresh green beans, black beans and pinto beans in a semi-sweet dressing.  Great appetizer on for a hot summer day.  For my entree, I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos, which were also amazing. Three small corn tortillas (house made) topped with big chunks of flash-fried mahi, pickled red pepper, and a special sauce. My wife ordered the black cod for her entree and it was also insanely good.  The house-made guac is also a must-have at The Mission, as they prepare it at your table.  Another must-have is the grits -- make sure you order it as a side dish -- be prepared for serious spiciness though.  Someone else in our party had the pork shoulder tacos, which he loved.  The ambiance: very cool. dimly lit, modern, classy.  What I didn't like:  Service: Our server had a bit of an attitude, and they were also out of several things we wanted to order.  We arrived at 8:15 and they were already out of the main soup on the menu (five chile soup).    All in all a must-try for \"fine dining\" Mexican in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I am giving 4 stars, but I am a little skeptical about this restaurants staying power. I know it just celebrated it's 1 year anniversary, but there is something suspect about this place.   I had dinner here with my family for my brother's 28th birthday. The interior is very warm and dark. There appeared to be a nice bar area and the dining area was nice and open. I did like the way they presented the menus. They had this leather bound cover and it fit very well with the decor.   We started with a table side guacamole. It was good. The guy that prepared it gave us a play by play and had very infomercial type voice. A little annoying. I almost felt bad for him. The portion wasn't very big however. The chips and salsa were good, but when is that bad. The selection on the menu is quite small and if you are vegetarian there are no options. I had the swordfish with a shrimp ceviche and rice. It was actually very good, but the portion was small by eating out standards. I actuality it was probably the perfect amount of food. The pork and chorizo was a hit at the table as well. I was also able to try the scallops. They were good, but a tad undercooked.   Here is what makes me worry about their staying power. The server to diner ratio was probably 2:1. We must have had at least 7 different people help out our table. We noticed a lot of other servers, runners, bussers, hostesses, and managers milling about. How can they afford to pay all of these people? Oh yeah, the food is on the expensive side.   It was good, but I won't be rushing back there.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week Review:  The food was good, and we happened to go on sunday with half off wine but the problem was that the restaurant week offerings were a \"tasting menu\".  That is not how any other restaurant did it, that is not how the online menu depicted the meals, and small tapas sized dishes do not count as \"courses\".  For what we got it was hugely over-priced.  $29 for 2 appetizers and a miniature dessert. 50 other restaurants around town managed to make full meals fit into the $29 price point.   If you can't follow the theme of the event, don't participate.    One of the reasons we chose The Mission was that a drink was included.  We assumed it was a glass of wine.  Well, it was actually about 2 ounces of a frozen margarita.  Take away the ice and you have about a teaspoon of tequila.  Thanks!  They should have used a thimble  as the icon for their drink on the Restaurant week list.        I got duck carnitas for \"course 1\".  It was 3 quarter sized gorditas.  (I am not exaggerating the small size)  It was tasty but if I wanted hors d'oeurvres I would go to a cocktail party.  My gf got a Rock Shrimp Salad which was small but decent too.    For appetizer 2 I got the Pork Shoulder and she got the Grouper.  I got maybe 2 oz of meat and she got maybe 3 ounces of fish.  Both were good, but not satisfying.    For appetizer 3 (dessert edition) we got the churros with a chocolate shake which was 4 pinky sized churros with about 3 sips of a milkshake.  I think I could have stored the entire amount in the straw.  The gf got Pastel de Almendra which I don't remember how it was.  Wasn't great, wasn't bad.    Of the 4 places we tried for Restaurant week, this place came in last.  Food wasn't as good as the others (Avalon, Wildfish, Papas Tapa Frita) and obviously the hobbit portions were not in the spirit of the event.  I'll stick to the other places that sacrificed a little profit margin in order to gain a new customer Vs this place trying to find a way to take as much money as possible while doling out the least amount of food pleasure.",

    "text": "Having heard Phoenix dining doesn't often extend past 10pm I was admittedly surprised by the people waiting out the door but judging from the number of halter-tops and guys wearing sun glasses at night I quickly realized that The Mission was not all about \"dining\" after all and on my new friend's arrival we exchanged greetings and made our way through the crowd, across the patio, and into the dimly lit room.  Setting prejudices aside and deciding to let the food do the talking I was pleasantly surprised.  Full review with pictures is in my blog, highlight dishes are below:  With the kitchen moving surprisingly quickly despite (or perhaps because of) the late hour it would be perhaps fifteen minutes before our first course of the evening would arrive and although something I'd not have traditionally ordered the Almejas Al Vapor would prove to be well worth its \"best in the valley\" designation.  Described as Peruvian in origin and served in a large low-bowl along with dense \"pan de yucca\" bread with a good sponge for dipping this complex amalgam of spicy aji Amarillo chile powder, tender clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, roast corn, basil, garlic, and turmeric was everything its ingredients suggested and then some - hot and spicy, smoky and garlicky, sweet but saline, and all the while complex without being overwhelming.  While I personally could have stood for just a bit less salt and a touch more sweet to temper the spice this was a small quibble balanced nicely by the sweet rolls.  For the second of this round of appetizers my favorite plate of the meal would be presented as \"Duck Carnitas Empanada,\" an invariably upscale take on the traditional empanada with a golden flaky shell harboring orange glazed duck confit and an admixture of habaneros, mushrooms, cilantro, and queso Oaxaca.  Delectable on its own but certainly open to further adornment the empanada was subsequently topped with a chunk of seared foie gras and finally with a foie fortified queso Oaxaca pan sauce and a drizzle of tamarind oil with the end result sweet, savory, and totally decadent.  Left with a bit more time to digest and a lot less noise as the restaurant's population had literally dwindled by half a mere forty-five minutes after we were seated the final savory of the evening would arrive just after 11pm and as I was doing the ordering it just so happened to be a second round of my favorite fowl, this time the \"Green Chile Duck Confit.\"  Ample in portion and more so in flavor this pile of two legs and two thighs featured a whole lot of duck for the dollar but unfortunately was just a bit less crispy than one would have hoped - a small quibble as it was not greasy, but not \"textbook\" confit by any means.  Again spicy without being \"hot\" the duck subsequently topped with sultana serrano peanut mole and paired on the plate with savory \"cheesy fried hominy\" that tasted something like a cross between popcorn and corn nuts plus smoked mushrooms to help ground the rest of the flavors.  For dessert The Mission's Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Scotch, Caramel, Pepitas, Pomeganate, and Chipotle seasonings was quite outstanding.  Beginning first with the pudding, almost a steamed sticky pudding in texture, the flavor of the pumpkin, cinnamon, and clove was present in spades and the scotch tones blended nicely with the sweet caramel giving it all a heavy handed boozy bite.  With a touch of spice from the chipotle cooled by quickly melting dulce de leche ice cream I additionally found a lot of appeal in the pumpkin seeds and pomegranate with their respective salty and sweet crunch adding some texture.  A modest tab, particularly when split, we opted to divide the bill down the middle and with that we made our way to the streets where, as I'd been told, few people were to be found at 11:30pm even on a Saturday.  Saying our goodbyes I made my way to my car satisfied with my meal at the Mission and realizing that perhaps my bias against \"scene restaurants\" was a bit unfounded, much like my preconceptions about \"Southwest cuisine\" - a fitting conclusion to my first trip to Arizona and a bit of reassurance that I could undoubtedly live here.  Sure the city shuts down early but to be completely honest by the time we left The Mission it was already nearly 2 hours after my typical bedtime anyway.",

I happened to stumble upon this intimate restaurant one evening in old town Scottsdale and was so surprised to find this hot spot. It's literally in a old mission and chef Matt Carter from Zinc Bistro serves up great tasting Latin American cuisine. The atmosphere is cozy and the decor is impressive.   I would classify their menu items as more tapa style and it's a little pricey but worth it. I'm a huge fan of their table-side guacamole and their smokey flavored salsa is to die for. The shrimp anticuchos (skewered shrimp) are excellent. I would recommend the tecate skirt steak tacos served on hand made corn tortillas but the pulled-pork is also excellent. The portions are small and if you are used to large, hearty portions, then I would not recommend this place; however, I enjoy more tapa style because you can sample more of their delicious menu items.   Don't forget to check out their extensive tequila selection and their Spanish wine list; the sangria is excellent as well.   I would definitely recommend this quaint spot for any event, date or outing and the staff are friendly and remembered my name the second time I walked in. Everyone is very friendly and it's well worth every penny.",

    "text": "The Mission has been a favorite of mine since it opened.  I had my Farewell to Scottsdale, Arizona brunch on April 27th, and it was very disappointing.  After we were seated at 11 a.m.,  ordered drinks, and were given menus; the waitress advised us upon taking our order that their fryer was broken, and wouldn't be repaired anytime soon, or at least while we were dining.  Really problematic for our party, as we were looking forward to splitting their fabulous french fries.  There was a rather dismissive apology by the waitress, then she advised us that any of the entrees that would normally require a fryer could be prepared as grilled. I really couldn't think of what that was on the menu, but I ended up ordering a couple of \"safe\" appetizers to split, and left disappointed. We also ordered chips and guacamole, and the chips were either from another establishment or yesterday's as they were stale and uninviting.  Not what you would want to pair with $12 tableside guac.   It was even more entertaining to watch the very large touristy family next to us who wandered in with 7 kids under the age of 12.  There was nada on the menu for these little ones to eat except a quesadilla I guess.  After they ordered, their waiter came back to their table to let them know that their whiny kids would be ordering something else besides french fries and empanadas.  Sort of a metaphor for me and Scottsdale as a whole, glad to be back in Cali.",

The avocado margarita was also great - cooling and refreshing.  Food is where things fell apart.  The menu looks amazing - we had a hard time picking what we wanted to order because the combinations all sounded so interesting.  So we enlisted the help of our server who was extremely passionate about the duck empanada and malbec braised short ribs which were in our consideration set.  The duck lacked any real flavor or richness - neither the foir gras nor the habanero came through.  But the short ribs were honestly a disaster.  The meat was incredibly dry - we couldn't even imagine how something braised could be so dry, unless they make it once or twice a week and then reheat in the microwave.  We barely ate half, and I typically will finish anything.  Guac was fine, nothing special.  Definitely not worth $12 in terms of either quality or quantity.  Ambiance was nice, but not enough to balance out mediocre (at best) food.  Unfortunate - I was looking forward to this meal.",

That said: !!!!!!!!! and to follow up: yummmm.   I stopped by for lunch and sat on the front patio which was perfect since the the sun was diffused, there was a breeze and I could eyeball other people's meals while I waited. My server was Sam who is probably the most gregarious server I've had in a long time. That was great because I was dining alone and he made me feel like I was not a loser. I ordered the Corn Gorditas ($9) and the Taro Fries ($7) and was pleased with both. My only regret was using the fries' two dipping sauces because it numbed my pallate a little in terms of appreciating the nuances of the gorditas, which were a little small for a $9 appetizer but all the same, very complete in their blend of flavors and textures.   Then I took my meal to the next level by ordering dessert. I'm not sure \"orgasm in my mouth\" is a family-friendly term but nonetheless it applies to the pumpkin bread pudding ($6) I ordered. As if pumpkin needed any help, The Mission soaks it in a caramel sauce and sprinkles it with pepitas and pomegranate seeds after adding a heaping scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Forgasm.in.my&s=9ede46dfe3cd68e8c05068a2224401e1c2715080d0f5c85d0c46c07625b06019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">orgasm.in.my</a>.mouth. I only wished there were a few more pomegranate seeds tossed on there because their tart juice really contrasted beautifully. I tried not to moan out loud as I ate it.   So the Mission isn't cheap, not by a long stretch, but what is created in that kitchen is culinary artwork, and combined with their very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere, I think the Mission is doing everything right.",

    "text": "At least I finally went and have a review written before it hits 100.  Some things just take time.    That said, we attended the Pig Roast on a Sunday Afternoon.  The pork was really tender.  The little tortillas we so cute!  Loved all the little itty bitty condiments to daintily spoon on your mini tacos.  It was fun to do as something different and out of the ordinary.  As a huge bonus, wine by the bottle was  1/2 price!!  Who~Hoo!!  Loved the sexy & romantic decor.  Nice and cozy, just right (as Goldilocks said).  Their brunch menu looks cool, but I am not big into breakfast.  The regular menu prices did seem fairly high, so I am not sure I would come back for Din~Dins, but I would love to re-visit, and sit at the intimate bar for a Sunday where there is drink specials and of course to take advantage of their fabby wine prices.",

I don't know if it was the Coronas or the guacamole, but for some odd reason all of my inhibitions flew out the nicely decorated adobe windows.  I found myself chatting with some very interesting people and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  When I first arrived (@5:25pm) there weren't too many people here.  Scott reminded me that it was still a bit early, so I took advantage and GOT MY DRINK ON.  Eventually, a group of blue hairs came in and got the party started (not really, they just sat down and ordered food, but that would make an awesome story, right?!)   I saw some familiar faces from past events Julia, Dottsy, & Robert. Sorry, I don't nag my weak memory with last initials, but I also met some GREAT new faces.  Thanks, Gabi! I dunno how you do it, but somehow you always do!",

    "text": "I think for my sesquicentennial review, I've gotten to a point where I'm letting the food direct the show of stars. Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing?   The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy.   What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings True? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.",

The worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  I've noticed that some waiters stop providing exceptional service if they are serving a bigger party because the tips are automatically added to the bill.  We had a party of 8 and It took our server almost an hour just to take our order.  Eventually when 7 out of 8 orders were served, the salmon was so bad it stunk up the whole restaurant.  My friend tried it and said that the fish was spoiled. We couldn't believe it, so we all tried it, and yes they prepared a rotten fish and served it!!!  As a cook, you gotta know that the fish is rotten when you cook it because IT STINKS and no amount of spice can cover that up!!!!!  She told the waiter about it who didn't even ask if there is something he can do to make it up to her.  Now for the missing order, when we finally pointed out that we were missing an order, we learned that they just forgot to make it and our waiter never even bothered to check if all of his orders were filled. At this point, six of us were done with our food, seventh send her rotten fish back, and eights was still waiting on her order.   Nice looking place,  awful service.  Would never go back and will never take my party there for any reasons.",

Meeting a lunch date I arrived early and enjoyed a Cabernet and raspberry frozen margarita. I was unsure about that but after a sample was offered, I was sold. Outstanding! There's a small patio in front but I'll pass in the heat and enjoy the great indoors. Spicy Spanish music filled the air and we ordered.  Start with the fresh guacamole made table side to taste. I love it that way. The salsa was delicious as well. Requesting input from our very knowledgeable waiter, I went with his suggestion of a spicy brisket sandwich but warned it comes with slaw on top. I'm not afraid. Bring it on. Across the table a Chipotle Caesar was greatly enjoyed.   While I was only there for lunch, I'll be sure to visit again for dinner. I have a feeling the nightlife at the bar is amazing.",

Our decision start with the Avocado Margarita and the Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita was a nice way to begin lunch!  The waiter described the Avocado Margarita as a smoothy but I found it more like a thick margarita.  Wonderful!  We had the table side traditional guacamole.  Very flavorful and quite enjoyable.  Whenever I see Pozole soup on the menu, I jump on it.  Their version was very unique.  Large chunks of smoky pork was a real surprise with a more broth base than I have had elsewhere.  A unique presentation and I will remember it!  We split the Shrimp Anticuchos and the Short rib tacos.  Both were excellent.   Enough for 2 people to share.  Service was great, the outdoor atmosphere was wonderful.  I will be back next time I'm in town",

Their brunch, lunch and dinner menus are all very good and unique.   My favorite item on the lunch menu in the Cubano Torta, it's excellent. For brunch they have really good bloody marys too. I have never actually had anything I didn't like, but like all restaurants some things are better than others.   I believe The Mission is located in an old church so the setting is different, however it is very dark and that has been a problem for some of the people I have been with (my mother mainly).   The service has been great everytime I have been seated at a table, but the two times I have gone just for drinks at the bar the service was awful. Both times I actually left annoyed because their service was so poor.   Overall, I think it's a great place to eat and an especially good place to take out of town guests who are wanting to try a more upscale Mexican restaurant.",

The service was interesting -they do \"team\" serving there, but we were told by 3 different servers that Amanda will be over shortly. Kind of weird that we didn't see Amanda until 20 minutes after we were seated. If it truly is a \"team\" service than don't mention a specific server, it was somewhat confusing. The service also seemed a bit slow at times, but everyone that interacted with our table was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  Table side guacamole was amazing! We had it made medium done up with a whole lotta fixins! I had the Kale salad with shrimp for dinner which was good, but a little too much kale -the plate was filled with it! If you like sweet the Coconut Strawberry Mojito is delicious!! Bread pudding for dessert was really tasty too!   All in all, I think The Mission is a great place and worth checking out!",

The french fries came in a huge basket with a spicy ketchup and a garlic aioli sauce.  They were cut small and very good.  The guac was in a tiny bowl that was made table side.  It was fresh but not worth 12 bucks.  The fish tacos were about the size of two bites.  Tasty but incredibly small.  The same with the pork tacos.  They gave us ten tortillas about the size of a sand dollar, a tiny amount of toppings, and a few mounds of pork.  They tasted excellent but again they were almost child fun size versions.    I also tried the aguacate margarita which was silky smooth and delicious but in a small glass filled with ice.  Nothing seemed worth the price for me.  I understand they are trying to do high end small bite Mexican food but none of it impressed me.  All I wanted was a regular sized taco that I could eat 3 or 4 bites of and be done with it.    The dessert was amazing.  We had the pumpkin bread pudding.  It was adult sized.  Warm bread pudding with a scotch syrup with ice cream and pepitas.  Very good.  I would recommend french fries and the bread pudding dessert.",

They have an extensive tequila menu and offer tequila flights. Tequila is not for me...so I opted for the strawberry coconut mojito which was just the right amount of sweet and very refreshing. My husband had the red Michelada with modelo. We also ordered the tableside guacamole and the shrimp anticuchos. We opted for spicy guacamole (without the chipotle puree) which paired nicely with the warm chips. The salsa they brought was not my favorite-it had a smokiness to it and I'm not a fan of that flavor. We also tried the shrimp anticuchos and they were really flavorful and buttery. Our server, Marlon, was really great and offered lots of suggestions for food. I'd definitely like to come back for dinner because the menu looks delicious!

Had the guacamole to start, they make it right at the table which is nice because you can adjust what you want in it and even how much. Very yummy. I had the chicken tacos and they were really good. It is kind of pricy, especially for what you get, but it is worth it!",

    "text": "This is a review for the fellas, but ladies - pay attention: Guys, there is only one reason to go to the mission, and it's to take your lover there and show her that you are a man of distinguished tastes and also that you have slightly too much money, but not too much that you're frivolous - just enough extra that you can afford things like expensive tiny tacos and fancy drinks.  When you go to the mission, maybe it's best to eat inside, because the lights are low, and the wood is dark, and it's moody - do you understand what I'm saying?  It's a romantic atmosphere.  So first get some drinks, and I recommend their margaritas, or their tequila mojito, but if you're a guy only order the tequila mojito if your lady already knows that you are a strong lover, because you don't want to send the wrong message, but it's an amazing drink.  Next, it's time for the tacos.  Their menu is pretty thick but it's mostly the cover that's thick, and there aren't actually a lot of pages, so focus on the tacos.  They're sold three at a time, so your will order three tiny tacos, and your lover will order three tiny tacos as well, and then maybe once the food comes, you have an opportunity to swap one.  Or maybe two.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Finally, desert.  Hey, get another drink and get some fried bananas - that's both a suggestive dish, and something delicious, and it lets you both set the mood for what happens after dinner.  That's it.  If you don't like the food or drinks, you don't know what good is, and if you haven't set the mood right, then you have nobody to blame but yourself (or maybe you need to be more discerning about your choice of lovers).  The Mission.",

I highly recommend the tableside guacamole and corn (on the cob). If you're a foie gras fan like me, the duck carnitas empanadas are not to be missed. We finished it all off with the pork shoulder tacos and mahi mahi tacos. It was all great for sharing and I would definitely go back to explore more of the menu.",

    "text": "Three stars because the food is AMAZING but the experience... Meh.   It starts off by us calling to see the wait. We are immediately put on hold for almost 4 minutes. The waits about 45 minutes which considering it's a Saturday in old town when all the snowbirds are coming back its not bad. We get there and are told at worst an hour... Totally fine. Until they never put our name in the system.   My fiance goes up after quite awhile to ask how close we are to being sat when the hostess shuffles papers and then says we can just be sat right now. Which is nice except the couple that just walked in an hour after us is being told the same exact thing. We could have sat much sooner.   Then we get sat in the bar at a corner table where my fiance is getting bumped into by the waitress, the guacamole table and other guests.   I order a Diet Coke and my fiance gets a gin and tonic. My Diet Coke is forgotten and we had to ask the food runner for it 10 minutes later.   We had the wings and street corn for an appetizer both of which were incredible but then we finished and waited 25 more minutes for our actual meal. On top of that our table was so small it almost didn't fit what we ordered.   Again the food really is so good. It's worth the long wait (if they don't forget to put you on the actual list), but when we spend over $100 on a meal for two we would hope for a much better experience.",

    "text": "As a disclaimer, I was here for an event so I'm not sure how it is on a regular night, but wow did I ever have fun! We were greeted by friendly staff and directed to the tequila tasting, then to the bar for our complimentary beverage. The drink was delicious, with well balanced flavours and a boozy kick that didn't overpower the taste completely. There was a dried chili in my drink that I was exceptionally tempted to eat, but I think I would likely have no tongue left had I done that!  I was introduced to some lovely people at the event, and spent some time chatting and enjoying the atmosphere; The Mission has a very carefully balanced feel that straddles the line between hip and old world in a charming and successful way.   There were some unreasonably delicious snacks served too - crunchy tortilla chips with a salsa that tasted like it had been roasted and sprinkled with fairy dust, and the best guacamole of my life. No joke. Locals likely have a lot more experience than I do, but as a Brit who moved to Vancouver I haven't experienced a lot that have blown my socks off. Now, I wasn't wearing socks the night I went to The Mission, but when I got home all of my socks were in disarray; I think you get the picture! The guac was rich, creamy, and incredibly fresh tasting with a plethora of yummy tastes that all danced together in a happy boogie. Go try it immediately!   I had a look at the full menu after the event as I was hungry for more Latin food, but I found most of the prices to be quite expensive. I'll be back for sure, but it will definitely be a special treat!",

    "text": "First I will apologize for the dark photos, but this place is UNLIT. Just factual, but a close friend in the restaurant biz once said, \"Don't eat anything you can't see\". She would never eat here, I guess. Waiters have a pocket light for your use, though. For menu, not food (unless you want that). I am probably a lot more forgiving of small portions because of all my NYC meals. The quality of every ingredient here was top-notch. We started with wings, eight wing tip only pieces, in a spicy sweet sauce. Perfect cook on the wings but not much for the money. Flavor was yummy, so we forgave the size. We needed room anyways. We had the pork shoulder tacos for two. One issue, it came with this TINY tray of cheese, cilantro and onion.  Like a tablespoon of each. For ten tacos. The homemade taco shells were 3\" in diameter. You got ten of these for two people. The delicious sauce was supplied in ONE small dish. Not everyone likes sharing dirty spoons, so my biggest suggestion would be two servings of toppings and sauce for the $32 price, I mean really. Its sounding negative but I will tell you this, the pork shoulder meat, fork tender, was the single best piece of the pig I have ever had. Worth every cent. We had lots left over. No toppings left, because well, most stuck to the spoon. The pumpkin bread pudding was good, lots of crunchy bits that we couldn't see so was worrisome at times. This is AZ, you know. The street corn is also worth the visit. Spicy and hot with cheese and sauce soaking it. You have to try this. So, my advice to make tis the best night EVER, have lots of money in your pocket and no bills due. Sit outside and book early (you will need reservations which you can make on their website), and ask for extra toppings if you need them, do not be shy. And do not waste this place on a so-so date. Save it for \"the one\".  Great wait staff, really A-1.",

    "text": "My wife and I love Zinc Bistro in Scottsdale and when we went this time our waiter told us we should try The Mission, one of their newer and more \"happening\" locales  in Old Town.  I managed to get us reservations (just barely) for the day after next, which was a Sunday night. If you don't have reservations, you can expect to wait quite a while for a table on the weekends. As we expected, it was packed. Every table was full, standing room only at the bar, etc. With our reservation though, we were seated right away, which was great. It's a decent size restaurant but it's not huge, so they really try to pack people in, meaning the tables are both smaller than you might like and much closer to each other than I prefer. Don't plan on having too intimate or private of a conversation here.   We ordered two drinks to start, a Primarita and a Smokehouse; both completely delicious and at $13 each, fairly decently sized. And surprisingly, I didn't feel like I got more ice than alcohol. We also ordered the tableside guacamole, which is guacamole freshly prepared at your table to your specifications. However, in the already cramped conditions, it was a mildly awkward experience.  What made it even more awkward though was that we also ordered the Pork Shoulder Tacos, which the menu tells you is meant to be shared by two people. What the menu doesn't explicitly state is that what you get is a hunk of slow roasted pork shoulder brought to your teeny tiny table and you have to proceed to attempt to shred it yourself before you can actually prepare and eat said tacos. Doing that without knocking anything off of the table was a delicate task that I am fairly certain made my neighbors just as nervous as it made me as there were numerous close calls with the aforementioned tableside guacamole and our drinks, waters, salsa, etc. I am not a big fan of paying for food and having to prepare it myself before I can eat it. Overall everything was good, but it's not a place we'd rush back to.",

The atmosphere was nice but much to dark to see anything especially with the sunsetting through the windows. Service was very good and was sooo... quick I felt the idea was to just get the table turned. Food was quite good but overpriced for the portion size and that comes from someone that lives in South Florida. We had talked to many locals about the place before we went and while no one said anything bad they always had recommended other places when we asked where to go. Unfortunately we didn't heed the suggestions. So 3 Margaritas, Guacamole, 2 entrees flat iron and filet, and a dessert pumpkin bread pudding were $156 so I'll leave it to you to make your judgement. Found it odd that more than half the tables were being held for reservations yet they were on about a 15 name wait when we left.",

It was very crowded, and you are going to need a reservation for large groups.   However, we were sat immediately on their little patio out front. It was cozy and lovely. I actually recommend sitting out there when it's not 200 degrees outside. It's away from the hussel and bussel.   The food was delicious! I know their menu selection is limited, but the food that is on there is to die for. The chef is apparently French but working at a Latin restaurant. French and Latin fuse together to make a great combo. I had their filet and a bite of the chicken dish. Both were simply amazing.   ALSO If you only take one thing away from this review, remember to order the guacamole appetizer. It is the best guac I've ever tasted in my life!

    "text": "To put it concisely, the food was tiny & weird, though they do get props for excellent decor.  The place looks nice, there's no denying it. There's an obvious theme going on, low-light interior with candles on every surface, around a dozen and a half ornate chandeliers, crosses on the back wall to tie in with the actual Spanish Mission. It's going for dark & solemn, and it hits the mark, so kudos for that.  The food, though...I mean, I suppose my group and I should have been prepared for pretentious presentation and ridiculously small portions, given that this is Scottsdale, but seriously, when the food came out, we looked at each other, had a bit of a moment, all clearly baffled by how little we each had on our plates. It tasted alright, and was artfully plated, but still, far too small.  And it wasn't only the portions; part of the problem, at least for me personally, was what they tried to pass off as a salad. It was maybe five slivers of onion, a few itty bitty greens, and half a dozen extremely thin-sliced tomatillas. This was all sprinkled over my flat iron steak and repeatedly referred to by the waitress as a salad. It was not a salad. It was a garnish that they tried to talk up as a very fancy salad so they could justify charging $30 for the meal.  My group and I will not be returning. We're happy to visit our usual Mexican restaurant haunts. But hey, in an attempt to end on a happy note, I'd like to mention that the service was awesome. The hostesses were welcoming, our waters were refilled probably 7 or 8 times, our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and a manager checked on us halfway through the meal.  Maybe we should have told the manager that the food was tiny and weird...oh well.",

I'm basically a lush and will drink anything and everything, but rarely do I fall in love with a drink as I have you.  Even tho I don't live in Scottsdale I plan on coming back to visit you again.  Maybe have another secret rendezvous before it hits triple digits there.  Although I cannot lie if I do see this on a menu elsewhere I will have to cheat on you, but it will mean nothing.  What we have is special I swear.  I will dream about you until we meet again.  Oh minus one star for all the flies on the patio.  Maybe invest in some Citron candles?",

You have a thief on your team that should be monitored, caught and let go.  We ate there last night (1/13).    As we were walking out the door, my friend realized that she left her cell phone on the table.  We barely got out the door and turned right back into the restaurant to go get it.  I know she had her phone there because she used the flashlight on the phone to read the menu.  Her phone was gone.  Our server used his flashlight to see if it fell on the ground.  Nothing.  So my friend said, who bussed our table (as I was calling her number to see if we could hear it nearby).  Nothing.  Thankfully our server did not give up and in an unusual turn if circumstances, her phone was left on a bench in the back of the restaurant (we were nowhere near that part of the restaurant - it's a different section entirely).  Whoever tried to steal it panicked and ditched the phone (probably because we were all hovering around the staff - they knew it - and we were calling the phone to see if we could hear it or see the light on it as it was ringing).    When she got her phone back, guess what was on the screen, her Privacy Settings in her phone.  Wow, that put a damper on the otherwise great experience at The Mission.  Keep your phones close customers!!  What a bummer.  Management-take this serious please as this could ruin your great reputation.  Thank you",

    "text": "I was visiting Scottsdale and looking for something to eat for lunch.. So I checked Yelp and found The Mission with 4 stars reviews overall.. serves mexican food (which Arizona is known for)... and within walking distance from where I was at, so I gave it a try. First I was confused with the church next to it but then I walked further.. and was so glad I found this restaurant.  So.. here I am ... at The Mission!   The atmosphere is very cool... they have outdoor seating areas at the front and at the back, in the middle is the bar area and indoor seating which is very dark. We chose to sit outdoor since they have heater and blanket.  The food? Meh! What I really don't like is: Our server offered Chips & Guacamole, and later I found out that they cost $14 which is about the same as the cost of most entrees in their menu. Since it's Sunday we chose Sunday Pig Out, which is all you can eat pork tacos. The downside is since we sat outdoor at the back, we had to walk inside to get our pork tacos. They tasted ok.. nothing special. We also ordered Lunch Mahi Tacos as recommended by our server, which consists of 3 small tacos with small portion of deep fried mahi. The deep fried mahi is really really dry!  The drink? I ordered Blood Orange Margarita, again, as recommended by our server, which I later saw there was an additional $3 on the check for adding Solerno, which our server did not explain. It was served without the salt rim, it tasted just ok.  The service? Quite disappointing. Our server did not explain about the cost of Chips & Guacamole which was not on the menu. He also did not explain the additional charge on the margarita. He rarely checked our table either.  Despite the cool atmosphere and the great company I had, the food (tacos), service and drinks are not impressive at all.",

    "text": "(4.5) I came to The Mission with my dad and the ambiance, food and service were everything my dad hyped them up to be. The southwest, adobe style decor is so beautiful and authentic.   We both started with a margarita - the classic for him and the blood orange for me. The acidity of the blood orange in the margarita was delicious. Later we switched to wine, chosen from their extensive wine list. My parents had told me the table side guac was a must so we, of course, shared that before diving into our tacos. The server made the guac just to our liking - with a little bit of a kick but not too much. And it was the perfect portion for two people to share.   For mains, we both ordered the mahi mahi tacos which were superb. The breading on the tacos was super light and you can tell the corn tortillas are made in house. So delicious!    If you aren't a fan of dark restaurants - and by darke I mean darker than your standard nighttime mood lighting - you may not like this because it's very dark inside. We didn't mind it but needed a flashlight from time to time to see the menu and bill.   Overall great service and yummy, authentic food - did not disappoint!",

Next we ordered their table guac for appetizer which when asked how spicy we requested the spiciest (I eat a lot of spicy food) however, this was made a little too hot where we couldn't handle it so we asked if we can get it fixed by mixing more ingredients. The guy making the guacamole was not happy, he told us \"Well you ordered it like that\", he was not accommodating and came off as rude. Next we ordered their fish and barbacoa tacos which were really good. My overall experience was very good, I enjoyed the food and our waiter was very nice.

    "text": "We've had The Mission deeply buried in our Yelp bookmarks for quite some time now, specifically saving it for when we're in the mood for an \"upscale dining\" experience.   The Mission specializes in serving what they describe as a modern take on Latin cuisine, throwing in multiple South American influences that are guaranteed to make for an interesting experience. Yelp ratings are fairly high - and given that they're one of the few restaurants in Phoenix in the ultra-rare \"1000-plus review\" club, our expectations were very high going in.  We booked a reservation for a late-afternoon/early evening Saturday about a week in advance. While walking through the restaurant, the front patio (with fireplace) and restaurant interior appear to give off a lovely ambiance. Unfortunately, we were relegated to the back-patio awning during a particularly nasty rainfall. It was basically just a bunch of tables mashed together and didn't really offer much in terms of style or vibe. I felt like I was at one of those church potlucks that my Mom would always force me to attend as a child.  Anyway, we decided to start with their tableside guacamole. We were able to request the \"mild\" version to avoid any unexpected spice issues. Honestly, we were both very impressed with its complex flavor, ranking it right up with some of the best guacamole we've ever had in Phoenix. The best? Not quite - but pretty damned close! Clearly they've got their guac preparation down to a science. Additionally, we ordered the street corn (off the cob). All ingredients, including the mild inclusion of butter, chila paprika, aji rocoto, cilantro, and cotij were all extremely well balanced, with nothing overpowering the dish as a whole.   On a side note, do you know the one thing that drives me absolutely crazy about some of these restaurants? When they bring out everything you've ordered at the same damned time! Starters are called starters for a reason, you know? When you bring out the starters, don't bring out the main entrees literally minutes later, people! We considered saying something, but decided not to, for fear that they'd just stick our taco plates under a heat lamp for thirty minutes while we finished the guac and corn. Bloody hell!  With that rant aside, we ordered two taco plates, consisting of the short rib barbacoa and skirt steak (3 tacos per plate). Being forced to push the guac and corn off to the side, we both agreed that the barbacoa was decent. However, it was the skirt steak which really blew us away, having a lovely smokey and complex flavor that easily destroys most (if not all) carne asada tacos we've tried in Phoenix. How they make them this good? I'm not entirely sure, but this is exactly how they should always be done. No questions asked.  We also ordered a side of papas y chorizo, which is basically self-explanatory. They were fine, although probably not necessary with all of the food we ordered.  For dessert, we chose the espresso churros - although I'm not entirely sure how espresso comes into play here. The miniature sized churros were good, although if espresso was somehow infused into them, it was difficult to detect. The dish also came with a cinnamon-flavored milkshake that was similar to a thickened horchata. We both enjoyed it, but not to the point where we'd order it again.  Overall, I'd rate the experience as four stars. Servers were all very polite, although it was a bit weird that multiple people would attempt to take our order, despite us already having placed it. We're not really sure who our primary server was throughout the evening. Rushing all the food out at once didn't really ruin the experience, but it definitely threw off our usual dining pace.  In the end, I was fully expecting a triple digit bill, but was pleasantly surprised to discover that our end-price was really no different than what we'd pay at any moderately-priced restaurant. I'm sure if you drink alcohol, this would change pretty quickly.  Aside from some of the quirks I mentioned, we'd definitely return - although I'm more interested in trying their new Kierland location in the near future.  Bottom line: Make a reservation and ensure that you're guaranteed a spot either indoors or on the front patio. Don't make things too convenient for the servers by ordering everything at once, but take your time making your choices in order to savor every dish they bring to your table.  Minor complaints aside, based solely on their guacamole and skirt steak tacos, I just can't resist giving them a strong recommendation!",

    "text": "\"On the road again.......\" I was here on business, and after many positive reviews (both from locals, Yelp and other friends), we decided to head to the Mission Old Town. We had a reservation, and it was a coworker's birthday - so we thought it to be a perfect choice.  Boy - were we wrong. Our reservation wasn't available on time, and more time was spent waiting than eating or drinking!  We waited at a table for our reservation and for someone to take a drink order (we were told not to go to the bar). After being seated, we waited for a server. Then we waited for him to return for our order. Over 30 minutes later (I'm not exaggerating, folks) we received 2/3 of our appetizers, and then 15 minutes later, our server finally returned and we were able to notify him. Over an hour.......yes, an HOUR.......into our \"meal\" we had eaten only a few appetizers and hadn't even had a chance to place an order for entrees. Given the length of time, our table of SIX ordered six total tacos....and that was it.   I quite honestly don't even remember the food - and that's not like me - but nothing stood out as much as the poor, horribly slow and unapologetic service.",

    "text": "If you ask for recommendations of places to eat in Scottsdale, The Mission will always come up. It's a gorgeous venue attached to an old church that offers modern Latin cuisine and provides a romantic atmosphere. For starters my family ordered the street corn that was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the fresh guacamole which is prepared table side by an expert and allows you to choose the level of spiciness and the ingredients you'd like to incorporate. Many members of our group ordered the The Mission cocktail which is a classic margarita with an egg white froth on top. We were skeptical at first and we unsure how the egg whites would taste but they blended extremely well with the margarita.   For my entree I ordered the short rib barbacoa tacos which come as three hand pressed corn tortillas. The flavor was amazing but I was slightly disappointed that the size of the tacos were only about that of a sand dollar. For $12, I was expecting them to be slightly larger. If I return, I may want to split three orders of tacos between two people. Overall though it's a great restaurant to go with your family or on a romantic date!",

    "text": "Off night... ???  A group of my friends came to Scottsdale for a bachelorette party.  The Mission was a must try for all of us.  1.  We don't get very good Mexican restaurant up here.  2.  Rave reviews.   We had reservations for 8pm for 7 people.  We arrive a little early around 7:35pm and they were unable to seat us right away, odd the restaurant was not busy.  But we headed to the bar.   At 8:10 we were finally brought to  to our table.  Restaurant was located in Old town right beside the famous church.  Decor was lovely, very romantic setting, maybe on the darker side but it didn't bother me.  You might need a flashlight to read the menu.   We were greeted by our server, took our drink orders.  We all were pretty excited to order and realized we all wanted the Mahi Mahi Tacos, and some type of side dishes to go with it.   We started with table side made guacamole, made with your preference, mild, spicy so on.  The salsa and chips where yummy.   Once our server took our, we obviously stuffed our faces with chips and dip.  Our server came back looking very apologetic.  All 7 of us ordered the mahi mahi tacos, and yup the ran out, not even 1!!!  My question is how can a Mexican restaurant run out of there only option of fish tacos!!?? So back to square one, I ended up with the skirt steak taco, nothing special.  I also ordered chicken tostadas and a jalepeno pineapple martini.  All ok.  Service was downhill from there.   First he forgot about one of the ladies drinks, 30 minutes later he apologies and gives it to her for free.  Forgot about one of the other ladies shrimp dishes all she got was a bowl of rice, and another ladies side corn.   I get it our server was hiding, and or busy, things were just not going his way tonight and some out of his control but made our experience not so enjoyable for the rest of us.  The poor expediter had to hear all our complains because our server was no where to be found.  I served for 16 years and you get bad days but you don't hide from your table, serving 101!! Once things started to settle most of us were finishing our server came around.  At this point we just wanted our bill and we were ready to go.   Overall, the food was ok to good nothing to rave about, and service was well you know, would we come back probably not.  I gave the restaurant 3 stars but its more 2 1/2 for me.  Maybe an off night.",

At the end of the day it was a great meal, he was a great server, amazing squash and Brussels sprout tacos, and 'Kimberly' made very tasty guacamole on the spot.

    "text": "A friend that lived in the area asked where we wanted to have our business meeting.  I emphatically said, \"How about The Mission in Old Town?\"  Looking back now, this is NOT a great place to have a business meeting wherein you discus particulars of a project. However, this is a great place to hang out and enjoy great food.  In the dark!  It was late in the afternoon when I arrived, and after being blinded by the searing sunlight in the Arizona dessert all day, it took awhile for my eyes to adjust to this dimly lit establishment.  And after about a half hour of munching on chips and guacamole, my eyes still had trouble reading the menu due to the lack of illumination. Following the cue of nearly everyone around us, we broke out our phones and used the flashlight app.  Speaking of everyone around us, if you have an issue with needing large amounts of personal space. Either sit out in the patio or dine someplace else. There isn't really much room in here, and you will get an opportunity to hear the conversations of random strangers. And be careful when extricating yourself from your seat or bench. The table spacing is quite narrow, and there's always an opportunity to bang into another table, or another person.  Now that hurdle has been overcome. It was time to enjoy the food.  I had the Salmon. It came with tomato jam, peppers, and sweet corn puree. It was definitely a very enlivened dish, and added a distinctiveness to the Salmon's typical flavoring.  My friend had the Pork Shoulders. This is one of their specialties. It is smoked and slow braised for hours. And comes with a Habanero glaze and small hand made corn tortillas. He comes here often, and this is pretty much all he orders. And I can taste why!  The Pork is so tender. And the glaze gives a great sweetness to the pork, unlike the typical preparation for this type of meat. The tortillas were so fresh and soft. They just en wrapped the pork and held on tight until that first delectable bite!  Once we were done, we ordered and shared the fried bananas for dessert. This wasn't quite what I was expecting. I wanted my bananas to be a bit riper. Such was not the case.  All in all, this is a wonderful restaurant that serves amazing \"modern latin cuisine.\"   Just be prepared to bring a small flashlight!",

    "text": "If I could give 10 stars I would. This place completely blew my husband and I away. We went late one evening and had to go back the next day for dinner again! The second we walked in the door the place smelt just like my hispanic grandmothers house. So we were immediately like \"this is gonna be good!!!\" Haha.   The first night we went, it ended up being a super late dinner so it was a lot more calm and our server (Greg) was awesome. The second evening we went it was around 6 o'clock so it was extremely busy and hectic so we sat at the community table, (not quiet sure of our severs name,) but our experience was still a good one. The ambience is very dark but the wall is all Himalayan salt block so with the candle light it gives it this really moody glow. With the decor everything is really modern Latin and insanely cool.   Both times we ordered table side guac. You can adjust the spice level given that the gal asks and is making it right there. We tried medium one night and spicy the next, however neither were too spicy. The margaritas are great. I tried the blood orange and the strawberry banana. Their taco menu is so different and I'm sure you can't go wrong with whatever you choose but I was EXTREMELY thrilled to see two vegetarian options and between both nights ordered one of each. The deserts are out of this world. The milkshake that comes with the espresso churros is something from another planet because it was HEAVEN.   I literally cannot say enough good things about this place. If you're in or around Scottsdale, do yourself a favor and go!",

One of the best skirt steaks I've had on a taco or outside. It wasn't too chewey and not too tough. Literally the perfect cook.   I would definitely come back here and eat all their tacos.

The table side guacamole was good, not sure if it was worth the whopping $14 for the big scoop. But we definitely enjoyed it.   The chips are thin and crisp, and salsa Smokey and spicy.  This was our favorite part of our lunch.   The street tacos come with 3 small tacos. My husband got the rock shrimp, they were okay, nothing outstanding.  I got the chicken Caesar salad, the Romain was cold and crispy, there were a few black beans sprinkled throughout, and the chicken was dressed in a creamy dressing. I wish it was just seasoned chicken without the heavy dressing.   We both got a margarita, I had the mission and my husband had the spicy hibiscus. Both were good, but again...\"overpriced!\"  Not sure I'd return, I've had better Mexican, with a better price point, and better quality.",

In the heart of old town, perched right next to an OLPH church sits an unassuming restaurant that has officially shattered the salsa records of any restaurant around.  The tableside guacamole was super busy, served in a silly container, but also delicious. Definitely would order again. The presentation was fabulous and loved the added touch of pepitas.  The tacos were crazy good, though I'd like a chance to mix and match a few. This is totally a great place for vegans, as you could just ask them to skip the cotija cheese.  The French fries were thin cut and perfect, the corn our friend ordered was \"the best\" he'd ever had, and the salsa. THE SALSA. Y'all, this was eat-with-a-spoon worthy. The chips were just as amazing and together the perfect pairing. I'd return just for the salsa, but the rest was also dang delish.",

The butternut squash tacos were also exceptional. The guacamole was very fresh and the street corn was perfection.   They have a salt wall in the bar that was a good conversation piece. Some patrons have a few drinks and  afterwards lick the community wall. (It's technically not there to be licked) This information inspired everyone to share their experiences similar to this one. The grossest being the mention of a chewed bubble gum wall. It all became pretty humorous and stayed light hearted.   Seating is available inside and outside. Both areas are set up cozy and relaxing. The bar area offers a community table making it easy to make new friends.",

Love table made so it's fresh and chunky.   Switched over to the mains.  Had the Flat Steak, Green Chile Confit Duck, Chorizo Porchetta & Creekside Filet. No water beasts died in our feast tonight.   All were Superb and highly recommend. One thing they couldn't control were the flies and there were tons of them. I might sit inside next time due to this.",

    "text": "Talk about delicious!  Came here for my bachelorette weekend, and so many people had recommended going to the Mission. Looking at the pictures and the menu, I wasn't all that impressed initially. But boy and I glad we ended up coming here for lunch. It was so delicious! I wish we could have gone for dinner because the menu is different, but still, it was a great experience.  Cocktails are great! I tried a little bit of everything but the spicy peach marg was my favorite.   We got the table side guacamole and it was so delicious!!! You can customize it since they're right there. We were scared to get spicy but for the second one we ordered (because it was that good), we got the spicy. It's a tad expensive for guacamole but I think it was worth it. ($14.)  Now the grilled street corn off the cob was also a table favorite! Talk about perfect. I'm drooling just thinking about it.   We got a variety of tacos to share: Barbacoa, pork shoulder, and steak. My least favorite was the steak.   The star of the show: the Cubano!!! By far the best cubano ive ever had. Seriously. Everything about the sandwich was amazing, and it wasn't mustardy at all like some other places do cubanos. I throughly enjoyed how crispy and delicious the pork belly in the sandwich was.  Can't wait to come back to Scottsdale to enjoy eating here again!",

    "text": "This experience could have been a 1 star due to service, but management is attentive and was able to course correct. Kudos.   We had an 11:45am reservation for patio on Saturday. We arrived a few minutes early and were seated. We were told in advance to get the table side guacamole, so the minute the lovely lady preparing the guacamole asked us if we wanted it we immediately jumped on it.   Unfortunately, she was the only staff person (after we were seated) to even acknowledge us. There were two servers for the patio and both continued to walk by our table and not say a word to us. I assume that there may have been a miscommunication on whose table we were. Nonetheless at 12:05 I went back to the hostess and told her no one has stopped by except the lady making the guac since we had been seated. The hostess asked if we would like to move inside... I told her no, we want to stay outside and want someone to take our order outside. The manager was standing next to the hostess and they assured me someone would be right with us.  They sent us Nikki. She was amazing. She made some great recommendations, was well informed about the menu and drinks. Waters stayed full. The service immediately did a 180. The pork tacos are amazing, as is the corn and guacamole. Would definitely recommend those  Kudos to Nikki, the lady making guacamole (i really wish I got her name she was absolutely fantastic) and the restaurant manager for taking action. The food did not disappoint.",

    "text": "This place is an amazing brunch/lunch spot. It's in a very cute building reasonably near parking - good for Old Town Scottsdale, at least. The indoor seating is pretty dark, so I recommend sitting outdoors. They have plenty of space and the lighting is gorgeous.   The food was excellent. We started off with tableside guacamole. It was fabulous, especially the \"spicy\" version. At first the server told us street corn wasn't available yet, but then came back and told us they were wrong. This was the best plot twist ever- the street corn here is super flavorful and amazing. Much spicier than the spicy guacamole, too.   Despite how fun the brunch menu looked, our group all ordered different kinds of tacos. I had the pork shoulder and I have no regrets. The meat is the star of the dish, with just enough of other elements to keep every bite interesting. I heard good things about the shrimp and mahi mahi, but if I came back for tacos I'd just order the same thing.   The portions weren't huge but I was satisfied. I would describe the food as light but in the best way.  Splitting an appetizer with the tacos was the perfect amount of food.  It was nice to leave brunch not feeling bloated and having consumed a vegetable already.    I thoroughly adored my food and the outdoor ambiance here, as did everyone in our group. However, our service was just off. One of our group ordered a French press coffee, as it was the only decaf option, and the server was exasperated when they pointed out the excessively large chunks of grounds in the cup. They were mildly confrontational. It was weird because all the other employees seemed very friendly. I'll definitely be back, but only because of the food.",

I don't really think I have a enough material to truly say...but this is what I do have to say about my short experience there.  A friend suggested this place and because I have been to several establishments in this area over time I was thrilled to try something \"new\" to me-but actually very \"old\" to the area (read about it-I will not post the history of the place here)   Anyway ...I absolutely loved the wonderful indoor feel of the place .It is super dark and has lovely chandeliers so as we waited for a table we ordered a skinny margarita at the bar and then moved outside to a wonderful patio fireside table.  Our friend suggested we order the table side guacamole \"extra chunky\" and - Yes.. amazing  it was!   I needed to leave to get back to family before ordering more food..I can't wait to go back.

I could see them.  Then I asked the hostess about this issue.  She said \"our kitchen is really busy, and we do take some reservations.\"  What does that have to do with this situation?  I wasn't sure so I left, never getting a chance to eat their food.  You are not better than anyone.  Judging your patrons on the clothes they wear won't get you anywhere.

It could have been 4-stars, but the tacos were sadly small for the price.  Last week's experience was a real let down.  I took my family for a Latin dining experience and was sadly disappointed.  Being an arepa lover, I was excited to partake in the experience with my loved ones.  When we arrived, we were told that arepas were no longer part of the menu, although they were still on the menu :-(  They are now serving the sandwiches that were served on arepas, on the torta bread.  The server was apologetic, but frankly, after driving 40 miles to get this specific menu item and checking the on-line menu before making the trip, I was not happy.  The pabellon filling was very good, but again, a let down without the arepa.  To add insult to injury, when the sandwiches were served, they did not bring Mission fries on the plate, because according to the bus boy, the menu changed when the sandwich was no longer served on the arepa, and it no longer was served with the fries.  The server quickly righted this issue and offered us fries on the house.  There are some high points to the experience: the setting is very pretty and the service is attentive.  The chorizo and papas appetizer is delicious and something worth ordering when you go.",

My wife and i had the pork shoulder tacos.  Meh...  I thought it was juicy and tender, but lacked some flavor.  But then desert came, I had the fried bananas.  OMG!  Super guilty desert.  So good with the chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, peanut butter fluff and ice cream.  You can just skip the main course and go from appetizers to desert.  That would work!",

The filling was nice but the sauce was way too sweet and then there was the crust.  You needed a steak knife to cut the thing!  We ordered the pulled pork tacos for two dinner (32.00).  It took quite a while and when it came the tortillas were very small and extremely doughy.  The pork was fatty and just not very good.    On top of everything else, it is very dark so it's hard to see what you are eating.  I used my iPhone flashlight app so we could read the menus.    Really wanted to like the place but the quality was not there.  Definitely would never go back.  One start is for service and the other is for the drinks.  That's it.",

Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.

I'd heard Scottsdale was a cool place, and not being a native of the area, I desperately wanted to explore somewhere outside Glendale.  I'm so glad we happened to find this place!  The building itself is unobtrusive.  Quietly sitting a block off the main drag.  It really belies the beauty of the interior.  I was really impressed by the dimly lit interior.  Even if the place was full (it wasn't when we were there) I still think the sense of intimacy at each table would be pretty well preserved.  It's kind of like how people are just automatically quieter in churches.  Then, the really impressive part began: the food!  Mexican-ish.  Fusion, it might be called.  Our incredibly friendly server, Nick, came over and regaled us about the place.  My gf and I each ordered a glass of wine from their nicely stocked wine list and some guacamole.  Turned out, we were in for a real treat.  It's made fresh.  At your table.  And it was divine.  Our entrees were equally impressive.  My pork shoulder and chorizo with white truffle potatoes was easily the best pork dish I've yet had.  When the meal was done and we finally left, it was with the throughout sense of satisfaction you get from a truly impressive dining experience.",

    "text": "Oh, the decor. This place is worth a visit just to see what can be done architecturally with salt blocks. Apparently they use them for cooking and serving as well. I know because, as I was trying to coax my husband into the ladies' room to look at how they finished the walls (really), we were intercepted by Brian (one of the owners I think) who filled us in on the design features.  He even checked the men's room for occupants before ushering me in to see the paint job in there.   Our waiter was totally helpful when we asked about the beef anticuchos appetizer in our best canadian-billy  accents. This is an excellent appi. I totally recommend. Back to the waiter, he didn't even laugh when my husband wanted the Mahi Mahi tacos but ordered the \"Ahi-Ahi tackos \"(rhymes with rack-o. I know it's not a word.) Excellent also -- with sweet pickled peppers sliced on top. Not your average fish taco. We ate four of these lovely things between the two of us. They're really good but really small, so don't share a plate. See, that's we do, we're usually overwhelmed by the portion size at most restaurants and have learned to just order an appetizer and share a meal. Then we're usually sated. If not, it's time for dessert.   For dessert, I had a coconut margarita. With pineapple juice and bits of toasted coconut, it was very tasty and still had a smooth tequila flavor (which I relish).   The only thing keeping this from a five star-rating was the small portion size. We were almost home when my dude took a left instead of a right and pulled into the McDonald's drive-through. He then ordered a Big Mac and a Double Double (whatever that means) with fries. I was flummoxed and kind of scolded him with - why didn't you just order some more good food at The Mission rather than eating this garbage?.  Then I held the warm bag and smelled the fries. I ate all of them before we pulled into our diveway. So, I guess I was still hungry too but dazzled with the design and on my best behavior after getting busted for trying to sneak my guy into the girl's room.  It was a great dining experience - I highly recommend it. Just don't share.",

The Sophia instantly made my list as one of the best cocktails I have ever had - fresh strawberries and mint muddled in rum and another liqueur I can't remember. Just sweet enough to be refreshing.

We ate every last bite and definitely enjoyed the presentation aspect. Then we shared the corn (to die for) on the cob with a clever mix of spicy mayo and cotija cheese for the right mix of salty, heat and cream.   We finished up by sharing the pork shoulder tacos. These were fantastic and love that all their tortillas (including the chips) are 100% corn and therefore GF! I could have eaten 10 of them as they were that good!   My only knock is that it does seem pretty expensive. Throw in one margarita and one Tecate and the total for both of us with tip was $60! Yikes!!

    "text": "The Mission is a hidden gem, small in scope but grand in vision. There are three separate interior dining spaces, along with a small patio, which creates a warm vibe and reduces the bustle and sound levels, creating an intimate setting. The owner Pavle is very welcoming and is a superb host. For a quick weekend in Scottsdale we sat outside for an early afternoon bottle of wine and a cheese & fruit plate, which was off menu but Pavle said \"leave it to me to put something together\" and he delivered. We also took his recommendation for wine, with a Lynch Aligote and both were wonderful. We decided to return for a dinner the following evening, as the menu and wine list read so well. Putting ourselves in Pavle's hands, we had a bottle of champagne from Savoie and a Etna red, both great and well priced. He could have chosen something for $100, and we had a larger budget, but his picks were half that and it is a testament to his ability to deliver consistent value and a high quality experience for his patrons. He also shared a taste of two Chinons, one being a rarer personal selection, which was greatly appreciated. For dining, we put ourselves in his & the chef's hands, and they did not disappoint. Wonderful varied flavors, from the lamb dumplings, falafel plate, pasta, and then to chicken...and I'm writing from memory so I will be general, the cuisine we tried (about 25% of the menu) is a hybrid of \"classic\" Mediterranean (falafel, lamb...) but with Italian \"peasant\" influences (brothy with vegetables), light and flavorful, not heavy, with a \"Grandma's kitchen\" feel where the plating is home-y, large portions, not served with a \"reverence\" you might find at a fancy foodie restaurant. Definitely a warm welcoming feel, where food is more dionysian. Notable: the chicken is sourced from a small farm, we had a breast that was pounded thin, had a wonderful gameier taste and texture, served with a topping best described as a dry salsa, with halves of lightly cooked radish, with wonderful croutons of lightly fried polenta. Fabulous. Highly recommend you visit (& make reservations!...also note he bar has only 3 seats, but Pavle is very accomodating and will work with you). If I neglected to mention this, the wine selection is outstanding. Many local items (AZ & NM), as well as a robust Old World list. Anyone who favors Kermit Lynch selections for his wine list is a man to be trusted!",

    "text": "The decor, ambience isn't \"trying too hard\", it's just actually \"trying\" - to be something other than cookie cutter Mexican/Latin, and stand out from its Gilbert Ortega-esque Old Town surroundings. Charming Old World building with modern rustic elements woven in. Obviously some bucks dumped into it.  Everything was very good, some great. The wine list had just what I was looking for - a tasty Albarino and a Vinho Verde. The food was inventive, delicious and packed with flavor, and despite the full dining room, it came out fast. Almost too fast. I'll get into the food more after a few more visits.  I HAVE ONE CONCERN The Mission could become a victim of its own success. Maybe our couple visits were flukes but... We were a party of 4. When we got there it was PACKED. Like bar-packed, not restaurant-packed. Good for them, seriously. The owner (we knew this because we caught his episode of House Hunters Intl) seemed to personally make it his \"mission\" to keep us happy while we waited. Way cool. Kept checking in with hostess on our behalf and comped our drinks while we waited in the awkwardly crowded bar/hostess stand area. This was all beyond the call of duty for most owners.  So what's the concern? It has obviously become a hotspot with the look-at-me crowd. Hungry, bedazzled cougars and Affliction-afflicted d-bags. And all of them were on the prowl. This is great for business and buzz initially, but it doesn't sustain you when that crowd moves on to the next hotspot. In the meantime, it's hard to become a regular patron for the food&drink when you've got that scene to battle with. On a weekend, even with a reservation, you're likely in for a wait with no good place to wait.  As others have stated, the place appears to be staffed up to the bejeezus. The amount of staff is exaggerated a bit by the shared service style. You probably feel like there are more servers than there really are because you seem to meet all of them! As The Mission inevitably transitions into a calmer, sustainable success, I imagine the frenzy of bar patrons and staff will calm a bit.  All in all, hoping they stay around long enough to transition from a 4-star hunting ground into a 5-star place for us to become regulars.  Oh, and the Churros. Oh my God.",

My portion for the arepas was plenty as the venezuelan sandwich itself is filling, but also came with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries, which were good.

I am very impressed with the architecture and decor.  our waiter was a young man named sam (I am) who was very entertaining and knowledgeable.  He suggested a tequila I had never heard of, it was very good.  i shared the pork shoulder, thinking it would be huge, but it was not that much food.  still, very high quality and many new flavors.    as with other reviewers i am completely addicted to the pumpkin pudding.  for those of you who like tequila, this is the place.  i think i counted about four dozen different kinds.  (but no jose Cuervo reserva de familia, the very best in all the land!)....also flights of tequila so you can sample.  altogether, the mission is a delight, especially if others are footing the bill!  mike",

The chicken taco horrible and pumpkin bread pudding too sweet. Do not arrive starving, because the wait staff moves like turtles.  I give this a three at best.  Not worth the $$$",

Noah was our server, he made great suggestions and was totally patient with us, GREAT service! We started with the Blood Orange margarita's that were amazing! Followed those with the tableside guacamole that was equally fantastic. I had the fish tacos... they blew Wahoo's out of the water, plus the presentation was beautiful. To finish out the night we had the pumpkin bread pudding and the chocolate dessert of the evening... Unbelievable! I am so glad I don't live closer or I would eat the bread pudding every day! This is a great place for food, ambiance and service with friends or for date night. Noah mentioned their brunch and I hope to check that out too! Love it!",

    "text": "I went to the Mission with a group of 7 girls. We were a large group but since it was restaurant week, we thought it would not be too complicated for us all to enjoy a great meal with no issues.   The decor of this place is beautiful! It is so cool and so hip! I loved it but keep it mind it is pretty dark. There is a great little patio in the front of the restaurant, a bar with some seating available, and a small to medium sized main dining room.   The restaurant week menu was very enticing and I was immediately drawn to the Ahi Tuna appetizer, halibut entree, and churro expresso dessert. Unfortunately, they were out of the Tuna (which our server did not tell us until we were all ready to order. I ended up getting the pork belly salad which was yummy but we were a little annoyed we were not told up front that the restaurant week menu was limited. But no big deal, not the end of the world. We all ordered and were enjoying our cocktails when the waiter came back and said the kitchen only had two halibuts left and three of us had ordered it. It was disheartening to change my order yet again. I ended up ordering the filet. To be fair, it was amazing. Whatever they put in it rub seasoning was fantastic! I just had my heart set on the tuna and the halibut. (I have been studying the menu on-line days in advance!) The three desserts: expresso churro, fried bananas, and pumpkin bread pudding were all OK, nothing spectacular. We did get a free mini margarita with our meal but I am pretty sure there was no alcohol in it.   The staff was very polite and the place was packed. It was overall a great time but I have to go with 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 because I was forced to order things that I was not intending on having. They should be pretty stocked up considering how popular restaurant week is. Additionally, if they were out of something, it would have been nice if they could have offered an alternative third app.   I would go back because it was a great location, nice staff, cool place, and really good steak!",

We had to wait a long, long time between courses but the friendly waiter, Sam, made it right by not charging us for several items. Yes, the guacamole was good but a little small for $12. The chips were delicious but needed salt, which we had to ask for. Unfortunately we filled up on the chips and dip before our chicken and scallop mini tacos were served. The pork lettuce wraps were small but very tasty. I told our waiter when we first sat down that I was a big fan of grits and he said could get both types with my order but it never came. When I mentioned it at the end of our meal, he quickly brought me a tiny taste of the honey grits (no charge) which were spicy and sweet and a little strange. It probably would have tasted better if I had tried it before I was so full. Ditto for the pumpkin banana bread pudding, which was huge. I left feeling over stuffed and sick, which is something I never, ever do. I would go back but I would order less food and just stick to one dish along with the guacamole and bread pudding.",

We started with the tableside guacamole and all i could taste was salt.  Also, ordered the almejas with a side of bread for dipping but again way too heavy on the salt.  I guess if they are going to err on the side of overseasoning vs. under its better to over to satisfy the masses. Shared the fish and pork tacos with their homemade corn tortillas which were pretty good.  Still willing to give them another shot.  The staff was friendly but very slow and screwed up the order forgetting one of our dishes.  Probably will go back to try out their churros and sit out on the cozy patio out front.",

MIND BLOWING DESSERT ALERT.  we've all had churros at some point and time in our lives right...its kinda like eating a donut really...when its fresh, its amazing.  fried, sweet, and tastes like cinnamon...cant go wrong...  i USED to think this UNTIL i had the churros here at the Mission.  they serve up these mini churros here WITH a tres leches milkshake/ice cream that will make a grown man cry tears of joy.  i mean, im over there taking bites and barely able to control my emotions...knowing that i dont live in the area and will not be able to eat this anytime i wanted...  little deep fried churros that simply put, are the most delicious churro ive ever had... crispy, fried, buttery, sweet, cinnamon-y, just simply amazing little things...  go to The Mission. eat the churros. you will geek out when you do....",

    "text": "OVERPRICED ! The pork chop dinner was A pork chop ($28) Nothing on the plate but the pork chop. No apple ring...applesauce or even a sprig of parsley. $32 for ten tiny tacos with pork shoulder supposedly for two.  Each taco was two bites and my husband did the math.  It was so dark that the waiter gave us a flashlight to read the menu.  We were given the Bum's rush after our last bite of food.  The portions were so small that it didn't take us long to eat so we hadn't had time to visit with our friends.  The manger came to \"push us out the door\" No pretense about inquiring about our food or service.  $12 for chips for two?  We will return to our favorite Mexican restuarant where the chips and salsa are your welcome to the restuarant.  The Mission won't last.  It is definately not a family restuarant.  Too loud and too yuppy.",

The restaurant was freezing!! We requested they shut the back door to prevent the draft of cold air pouring in and was ignored. It was lunch time on a Monday and we were only the 2nd table to be seated, I wasn't sure why our request went ignored.   Shortly after taking our drink order our server vanished for almost 15 minutes. After which did not bring any of us water. We then placed our 2nd, 3rd and 4th request for water and finally receiving it the same time as our entrees. Would you like extra salsa? Too bad, the waitress never was to be seen again till my friend got up and approached the bar to have her soda refilled. It took her this long to realized we were annoyed. The food could have been the most amazing thing ever, but due to the lack of service I will NEVER go back.",

I will say that it is gorgeous inside and the low lighting creates ambiance. We got the Mission margaritas and they are good for the price.  We got the table side guacamole and it was spicy and wholesome. They make it to how you like, and that was pretty cool. We all got tacos... Pork shoulder, short rib, chicken and mahi. They come three to a plate and are 3 inches in size. They do fill you up so don't be alarmed. My short rib tacos were amazing and had so much flavor. The pork shoulder is for two, but of course my bro in law finished the entire chunk of meat they give you to make the tacos at the table. Overall, I will definitely be going back when I need a good street taco. Word to the wise, get a reservation. You'll have to wait a bit if you don't, but could always grab a drink at RnR across the way.  All in all, I also understand why some may believe this place is overrated. It's probably because you're paying high prices ($15 for 3 tacos with no sides) but that's what you get while eating out in Scottsdale.",

Every time I come out here, I just have to have the Mexican food, because although we have some good Mexican spots in Philly, it just isn't the same as the Southwest.  The Mission didn't disappoint, it was awesome.  The margaritas were very good, I have a cucumber jalapeno margarita and thought the combination of a little bit of heat with the margarita flavor was great.  Another of my friends had a martini which she said was good and my other buddy had the house margarita, also good.  Let's talk about the food though, the star of the show.  Street corn, with this spicy mayo type sauce on it, wow, awesome.  Grilled to perfection and the sauce was incredible.  For dinner we shared three dishes:  a flat iron steak, very good, tasty, well cooked, mahi mahi tacos, which were friend to perfection, crispy and very tasty and the dish that I would fly back for tonight, the porchetta stuffed with chorizo.  This pork dish was braised for 16 hours, literally falling apart, juicy, tender, tasty...was the best dish I had in Scottsdale.  To top of the meal, we had churros, that came with a milkshake...great way to end the meal.  Overall great experience, our server was awesome, food was on point, drinks were tasty, would definitely go back.  Price was reasonable, three people, appetizer, two drinks a piece and a meal and bill was around $200 total.  Not bad at all.",

The Mission is a gorgeous, dimly lit restaurant with chandeliers all over. It's beautiful, relaxing and definitely quiet enough where you can enjoy conversation. The crowd was just as stunning as any you'd see in an Old Town nightclub, too.  Besides the tasty mezcal I tried (lick some Tabasco off your hand before you sip it--trust me, it's great), I also loved The Mission's sangria, which was super-sweet.  There were not that many vegetarian options. I started off with a bowl of the gazpacho, which was chunk-free and had the perfect amount of spice to it. If you've never had the cold soup before, I highly recommend it here.  For dinner, I got the corn gorditas, which is normally an appetizer and definitely was not filling enough for a meal. The mini-corn tortillas were topped with veggies, and while tasty, the portion was meager. Next time, I'll try the veggie tacos.  The restaurant's moderately priced, and even though the food left me wanting more, the chic atmosphere really stands out in Old Town and was ultra-romantic.",

Every dish we picked out and that the lovely waitress also picked out and sent to us was some of the best food we have ever had. Strongly suggest the table side guacamole. Spicy is you can handle it.

The hostess said that they had another party coming in for that table at 9:45 and that I could show up a little early if I wanted to ensure that our meal would not be rushed. I told her we would show up at 8. We got there at 7:55 and were shown to our table, however it was not the table I had requested. Instead it was a tiny table cramped in between two other table with no room to move. I went back to speak to the hostess and told her that it was not the table we requested. She looked in the system and said that she must have missed the note and asked very rudely, \"Well what would you like me to do, ask the people sitting there to move?\" As bad as I wanted to say yes, I wasn't going to be that guy. I understand restaurants get busy, but I would not have chosen to dine here that evening had I not been assured that we would be seated at the table I requested. We even adjusted our plans to show up early to ensure we would not be rushed. Unfortunately, no matter how good the food was, I will only remember how they screwed up my reservation and acted as if I was an inconvenience.   That being said, the table side guacamole is very good! The pork shoulder tacos were good, (the pineapple habanero glaze is excellent) but certainly not worth the $32. The Jodori chicken was okay, but nothing great. I would have certainly gone back to try other items on the menu but their lack of attention to detail completely spoiled the experience. I will not be retuning.",

The food, service and ambiance have always been fantastic...it's troubling to write this, as my experiences have never fell short of my expectations, until last week.  We called to book a small birthday party (16) on the patio; it was confirmed and invitations were sent.    Imagine our surprise when 4 days later we were informed that the time we requested (and they confirmed) was not available, that we would need to guarantee a minimum of $100 per person, exclusive of tax/gratuity (this was the first time anyone communicated this) and that a party of 16 was too large for them to accommodate on the patio.  Furthermore, the woman who delivered this information was outright rude and offered no suggestion as to a remedy.    At this point, my friend (whose birthday we were planning to celebrate at The Mission) called back to speak with the same woman and attempt to understand how such a thing could have been so horribly miscommunicated and again, no apology or suggestion of remedy, rather, she defended her \"rudeness\" by saying that we were rude to her first and that there was nothing she could do.  Now, I appreciate that we were frustrated and that was apparent, however we were not to blame here, nor were we rude.  It's entirely possible that this was an isolated occurrence, however, it's important to remember that your customer's should not be made to feel that your error is theirs.",

    "text": "The Mission has been a place that I have always wanted to go to. It's in the area of town that I'm always in.   I had tried twice to make reservations and I couldn't get a spot. It made me want to go even more. Finally I was able to get in and have dinner.  When we walked in the place was beautiful. Dim lighting a buzz of lively chatter and happy people. We were promptly shown to our seats. It was as we had imagined. When we sat down we waited for about 5 mins until our waitress came to take our drink order. We put our drink orders and appetizer orders in. We got the Duck Confite  and Faus Gras Empanadas. It was so good. Oh man it was delicious. After about 15 mins I started to worry about why our waitress had not come to take our order. I had finished my drink and didn't get a water refill. By this time I was frustrated. It was until 38 mins later did our waitress come back to take our order. I was livid but she came with a bit of an attitude. I had noticed it in the beginning and now it was apparent that she was acting as if she didn't want to be there and we were an inconvenience. It started to get warm, very warm. She came back and asked us if we needed anything else and before we could answer she walked off. The drink I had ordered was good but the Margarita we had ordered wasn't the one we ordered and when we politely asked her to get the right drink we ordered she rudely replied \"I don't understand, that's what you ordered, *rolled her eyes* well what else would you like?\"  We replied with \"um well I'll just have a classic margarita, no salt on the rim\" and she replied with \"are you sure?\" Which then I answered \"oh we are sure sweetheart, we would rather not wait 39 mins to receive our drinks\" the food was good but small small Portions. The margarita we received had a salt rim and was not worth the $13 charged. We were also charged the drink we asked to not be charged for bc we didn't order it.   When we told her that our drink had that charge she replied with \"well I guess I can go take that off\" she replied with a \"nevermind\" we paid and left.   I was extremely disappointed and upset and didn't enjoy my time at all. It was a terrible experience and I do not want to return. The Mission is great looking but staff needed more training. Maybejust her. I was sad.",

My wife and I shared the street corn appetizer, chips and salsa, and pork tacos with a side of white bean puree, and while the chunk of pork was mostly fat, there was enough meat to fill all 10 tortillas somewhat generously.  In addition to their good food, their customer service was surprisingly good for a busy Saturday night. A lady at a table next to us had her purse sitting on the ground and they put a cloth napkin underneath it, they ask if you'd like the heater turned on (patio), offer a blanket when you arrive, our waitress brought us some food \"on the house\" to try, and they even escorted me to the restroom when I asked where it was located.  My only disappointments were that they didn't ask if we were there for any special occasions (which we were), it was extremely loud (large groups around us), and without a reservation, the wait was an 1+ hours unless we wanted to sit on the patio (which we did).",

    "text": "I've heard great things about the Mission from several sources so I was really looking forward to dinner here but was pretty disappointed with the food and drinks. We got the cucumber jalapeno margarita and a glass of wine. The wine was good but the waitress recommended the margarita and it was definitely lacking something. It tasted watered down and I could barely detect any jalapeno flavor.  For food we got the flank steak tacos, the mahi mahi tacos, and the Merlot braised pork shoulder with a side of tortillas. The food tasted fine but I wasn't blown away and I was expecting something more considering the price tag. The best item out of the three was probably the mahi mahi tacos because they were fairly large hunks of mahi mahi and were lightly fried. Although this may be because my taste buds had been spoiled from going to a certain incredible Mexican restaurant in Sedona a few days prior so The Mission couldn't compete in comparison.  For dessert we ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was delicious and definitely the best part of the meal.  The presentation of all the dishes was nice and the tortillas came out on a large warm block which kept the others warm which was nice.  The interior of the restaurant was quite dark and cave-esque but it was a cool setting and the back patio looked nice but there was a private party there so we couldn't check it out. The service was fine, our waitress kept recommending dishes which was nice but it got to the point where it seemed like she was just recommending things to get us to order more.  I'm glad I tried it since I've heard so much about it, but I have no plans on returning here again.",

Glad I followed the Yelper's advice and went on in to be greeted warmly and noticed the uniqueness and beauty of the interior. The service at the bar and recommendations for lunch were very nice.  I had the on-demand, handmade guacamole which very good.  I followed the chips and guac with the short rib barbacoa tacos.  I was leaning towards the mahi mahi tacos but then...I can have those almost anywhere.   The tacos were the right choice, thanks to Ruthie the bartender's recommendation.  I would certainly look forward to visiting The Mission again during my next visit and I'd would give one of their sister restaurants a try too.  My 2 cents. Greg T.",

    "text": "Amazing dining experience! I chose The Mission as my birthday destination because I wanted to try the food so bad! They not only delivered the goods, but managed to blow my mind at the same time.  I had been hatching \"my mission\" to visit The Mission for quite some time. It began after sampling their Peruvian Clam Stew at a Yelp party. Though it was a mere shot glass of a sampler, I was hooked. The mixture of spicy chorizo, briny clam goodness, and sweet coconut milk forever lingered on my palate only to tattoo my brain with a flavor memory that could not be satiated. Until now.  My dining compadre and I started with the tableside guacamole. It is the perfect balance of everything good that should go into guac. My server almost forgot to top it with toasted pepinos, but I mentioned this and got my dose. We moved to the Peruvian clam stew, but had them split the order in half so we could each sample it... and save room for a meaty entree. It was everything I had dreamed about and longed for 'lo these many years. Another nice touch is the sweet corn niblets that were sprinkled throughout the dish, providing a burst of sweetness to the rich complexity of the chorizo and clam broth.  Our entree was equally fantastic. Slow-cooked pork shoulder tacos. The handmade mini tortillas are presented on a heated salt rock! A generous hunk of fork-tender pork shoulder plus grated cotija cheese, diced red onion and fresh cilantro comprise this build-your-own street tacos ensemble. It really is a generous portion that feeds two, as claimed on the menu.  I might have let it slip to our tableside guacamole preparer that it was my birthday. Our waiter picked up on that and brought over a complimentary dessert that was the coup de grace. Warm bread pudding in a salted caramel sauce with a scoop of dulce de leche ice cream... Decadent without being overly sweet. This dessert again demonstrates the deftness with which The Mission balances flavors and textures. Pumpkin seeds provided some crunch and pomegranate gems gave just enough of a contrasting pop of tartness amidst the sea of delicately sweet caramel sauce.  Needless to say, I had a fabulous birthday, due in no small part to the otherworldly meal I had at The Mission. I will continue to dream about this food until the next time I am summoned. And then... should I choose to accept it... I will embark upon another holy mission in search of deliciousness...",

    "text": "Good location. We entered into a very dark place and were seated in a back corner. The staff was helpful and brought us the tome of a menu in a floppy soft leather cover that was impossible to read until I turned on my I-6 flashlight. We had two of the lights on for the 4 of us. I set one up to light the table to see the excellent guacamole. We asked the couple next to us if the light was bothering them. They we an early 20's couple and said they really appreciated being able to see what they were eating.   The portions were very small, especially the table side guacamole for 4. The priced were high for the tiny portions we received. Also, spicy items on the menu were not marked and the waitress did not know the difference between a little picante and mas picante!  As we left I noticed about half the tables had their phone flashlights on trying to figure out what to order. We did not stay for desert.",

The skirt steak tacos were extremely tender and flavorful. The only dish I've tried that I didn't enjoy were the chicken tacos, but probably because everything else had so much more flavor. I also love all the drink options, there is a great deal of unique liquors and specialty cocktails to try!   This place is delicious and unique! Will definitely be back!",

We found a table in the bar area so ended up sitting there. Everything that we ordered I felt like it was a bit salty. We started off with the tableside guacamole. The good thing about this is it is extremely fresh, they come to your table and make it right in front of you! It was good but a bit salty. I ordered the Tecate Skirt Steak. The steak was very tender but also a bit salty. & you get 3 mini tacos. They're really little. My friend is a vegetarian so she ordered the Grilled Portobello Mushroom which she didn't enjoy because it was also salty. The waitress asked how everything was and recommended the Corn Gorditas instead, took her plate and brought her the new dish. =)   For drinks, I got the Missionary which is a mix of the red sangria and the mission margarita. Yummy in my tummy! lol. My friend got the 360o Mint Lemonade which she loved.   I loved the ambience of the place and the customer service was amazing however I thought that the entrees were a bit over priced for some bite size tacos...",

    "text": "What a disappointment! We where looking forward to enjoying some tapas and tacos for an authentic southwest meal. We should of just said 4 orders of grey leather and fat please! because that's what their \"famous porchetta\" looked like it was obviously sitting and left over from the weekend. The waiter introduced himself and said \"before anything get it out of your head that this is a Mexican restaurant because is not! don't even look at the tacos and order from the main course page\" We were a bit surprised as the taco selection looked excellent and that it was we went for. So after the waiter basically saying the tacos suck we order some apps fresh guac at the table, Mexican corn both excellent but the pork belly wrap wasn't crispy as advertised it was like jerky and the duck empenadas were sold out. Then the grand finale we order from the \"main course page\" so we decided on the duck and halibut after about 15 minutes and being up sold to doubles on our drinks by the waiter who obviously wanted to jack up the bill not to receive a \"taco tip\" we are told they are they are out of the coveted main course items he pushed on us leaving the option of the porchetta that was . Have a feeling the dishwasher was cooking and not the weekend chef and we still tipped 20% because that's how we roll but thanks to this horrible experience we would never come back or recommend this restaurant. The decor is great and I'm sure with the right waiter and chef working it may be good.  Update: Unreal! 2 days after I get home food paradise featured the mission and the tacos looked incredible I couldn't believe it.",

We were the first seated in our section for the evening, and our waiter would disappear for long periods of time before checking in to provide water, take orders, and check on the quality of the food. I did notice other waiters who were far more attentive, so this may have been just a singular incident. Also, there were three tables near us using their phone flashlights to see menus or simply light their table throughout the meal - If the restaurant is this dark, I suggest that the management do something to meet the needs of those who need additional light without disturbing others in the restaurant.  Like I said, food was great.  I recommend for that reason alone, and hope your overall experience is better than ours.",

    "text": "Wow, where to begin? This place is incredible!  At the recommendation of our resort concierge and the high Yelp rating, we wanted to try The Mission.  This is not an American/Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurant so don't go in there thinking you are getting enchiladas and tamales. The food is more traditional Mexican or Central American but with twists. Let me begin with two things. First, get there early as the place gets busy and get a bit loud if you are inside. We sat on the rear patio at 5pm on a hot day but were quite comfortable.  Secondly, ask for Kate as your waitress.  She is a foodie, is passionate about the menu and will make great suggestions for you. Now the food.  It's seldom for me to eat somewhere where everything is incredible.  The table side guacamole, perfectly cooked chips, entrees, tortillas, dessert, and coffees were all superb. The guacamole is so fresh, make sure you get the shredded cheese and pumpkin seeds on top. They add a nuance to the appetizer that I hadn't had before. As others have posted pics I won't add mine.  We ordered the Marinated Jidori Chicken and Chorizo Porchetta for the main dishes.  My wife's chicken was amazing with wonderful spices overtopped a lightly cheese blended rice.  The roasted chicken was fork tender.  Each part of the dish would stand alone but together they make the dish even bigger, flavor wise. The Porchetta was unlike anything I've had. The house made chorizo is stuffed inside pork shoulder and roasted over pecan and mesquite until it falls apart. The herbs and slices make this a truly unique dish. There is an earthy flavor to the meat with no indication of what type of meat it actually is. I just savored each bite.  I am still thinking about it the next day.  The white bean puree was a wonderful as a stand alone or as a dip for the meat.  I also ordered a side of tortillas which came out atop a warmed salt block.  The were flaky with a perfect body for rounding up all the bits and pieces.    For dessert we orders the pumpkin bread pudding and, again, were amazed. This is the best bread pudding I've ever had.  It is served warm with a large scoop of ice cream.  There is a scotch syrup reduction in the bottom of the bowl that well compliments the bread.  Be sure to take your first bite without the ice cream so you can really taste all the spices.  The French press coffee is some of the smoothest I've had.  It is a Guatemalan bean with little acid and a full body. Sit and savor it with your dessert.    Don't miss this place and on our next Scottsdale adventure we will be back.",

We expected the lighting to be dim as usual though it makes seeing what we are eating difficult but this time the music was so loud and not conducive to enjoying a delicious meal that it put us off from wanting to go back.  We asked the manager if there was a reason why the music was so loud and was told that that was the way they , the staff, liked it.  There was no apology or even an attempt to lower the volume.  It was hard for us to carry on a conversation.  In addition the service was less than stellar.  Our entrees arrived before our salad plates were cleared away so we had to hold them until the servers were able to take them from us.  We had hoped to impress our out of town guests with a nice  dining experience and were embarrassed by the experience we had.

Was craving Pork Chile Verde but could not find anything on the menu that resembles it. Somewhat disappointed, we ordered medium & hot guacamole with chips and drinks. Loved that the guacamole was made fresh at your table...and it was delish! Chips were nice and warm too!!  I figured if I could not decide on what to order from the menu, I would just order more guacamole...but I settled on trying the Marinated Jidori Chicken  which is plated with grilled mushroom, Oaxacan cheesy rice, chile verde & fermented black bean sauce (I was able to get something with chile verde seasoning.)  AND it was fantastic! The flavors put together were phenomenal. I enjoyed every last bite, and it definitely made up for not being able to fulfill my initial craving. Also, the Pineapple Ginger Mojitos and Cucumber Jalapeno Margaritas were light and refreshing, too.  Our server, Tony, was friendly and efficient...helpful in clarifying specific dishes, etc. Our water glasses were never empty (although the server was the only one we came in contact with who did not have a friendly demeanor.) We appreciated the manager, Andre, coming to the table as I finished up my meal (I'm usually the last one to finish.)  He might've just been on the floor to gage the time it will take for the last few tables to empty, because it was post thirty minutes after closing...but I thought it was nice anyway.   Next, we will try out the Mission at Kierland and the sister reataurants; but we will be back!",

    "text": "A perfect night to enjoy outdoor seating with impeccable service. I will preface the rest of my review by saying that our Yelp commandos set up a dinner for the Community Managers in town for Regional Week. Our menu was preset so I'm not aware of the costs.  The weather in Arizona right now is perfect for outdoor eating, so take advantage of it while the gettin' is good. The Mission's outdoor area accommodated around 4-6 tables of our group of over 20 plus as well as other guests not with our party. There was a fire burning in the hearth, probably perfect for when the nights become a little chillier. The owner greeted us by presenting us with a shot of Tequila apparently made by George Clooney (hello!?) and instead of a lime and salt, there was an orange with brown sugar. This is what they call, \"mission style.\" Tequila is my enemy, but I sipped the shot and it was very smooth. I mostly ate the orange slice that I assume if I liked tequila would be a great innovative way to shoot it!  While most of our group opted for margs, I went rogue and ordered the red Sangria (though they have white as well) and it was perfect to pair with their chipotle salsa. Though I'm more of a pico de gallo/limey salsa girl, this one wasn't overly smokey. I have to say their table side guacamole was one of the best I've had. I love me some fresh guac, and if I could've had it for myself or had them make a bath tub of it, that would've rocked my world.   The first menu item was a petite pork app. Two of our table guests didn't eat pork, and our waiter, Tony, and the owner quickly brought them out other options. The app was a great crunchy texture and various levels of flavor. This was followed by a shaved kale salad. I am a sauce/dressing junkie, so I could've had more of the dressing, but I understand what they were going for. Then we were presented with three adorable tacos; one pork, one steak and one chicken. The steak was Tecate Skirt Steak, and if you know me you know I love me some Tecate, so that was definitely my favorite with the pork being very similar to the app and the chicken one, probably coming in second place. I would most definitely go back for another round of the steak tacos.   The service, again, was amazing. They would replace forks on a dime, ask about refills before you took your last couple of sips and they put napkins under our purses that we put on the ground. Something I have never seen, but consider immensely thoughtful.   I would definitely consider coming back to the Mission for a more upscale Mexican dining experience, especially when the weather is perfect like this. Absolutely perfect for a big group!",

    "text": "Let me break this down.  The company was a 6 star, but that's out of the subject.   The food was on the uneventful side with some shining accents. The guacamole was good and they mix it at your table, which adds some charm to the deal. Also you can request more or less spiciness which was good too. the avocados weren't as ripe as I would like them, though.  The roast corn gorditas were really tasteful but a little shy on the huitlacoche and really small, specially for $9.   I ordered the Chimmichurri Marinated Hanger Steak which description in the menu reads as follos: pan de bono + charred leek & scallion soubise + tomatillo salad. OK, the name and elaboration is for the presentation and for the price tag, I guess, but when it comes to flavor, it was more like an OK steak with some undetermined flavor.   I guess the labeling takes an important place here. If you give a dish a name, like chimichurri and the person who tries it has never try it before, it might be really good. But when you're expecting something and they deliver something else is kind of deceitful.  BTW the grilled street corn was pretty good!  The wine was good. We had the tempranillo Coto (I believe that was the name) and it was really good and inexpensive. I also tried the house melbac (courtesy of a really nice friend of mine :) and it was pretty good as well.  The decor is nice but there are a couple of things that I didn't like. The lightning is super dark, like in I-can't-read-the-menu-dark. The upper walls (where the ac vents are) looks dirty and stained. It might be that it was so dark that it was painting or something else, but it looks dirty to me.  The men's room has just one stall and one urinal. I guess the place was built before the new rules and so on, but more toilet space would be appreciated.  I would go back but I might lower my expectations next time. And I'll make sure that I have awesome company (like this time) because that really helps!",

    "text": "I want to love The Mission. I really do. The decor is awesome and the margaritas ROCK! But, the food is not doing it for me and I'm so disappointed!   I have had the guacamole and I thought it was fine but nothing so special it should be three times the price of guacamole anywhere else.  The cheese plate, on the other hand, I'd say that's where it's at  - the cheese portions were fair and the grilled pan de yuca was warm, soft and delicious!  The pozole was good but while I thought it was cute that the \"heat\" came on the side (you add your own serrano and garnish) I would have liked more of the flavor to come from the kitchen.   I actually have to say I did NOT like the mahi mahi tacos and it had nothing to do with the size (they ARE small - the tortillas can't be more than 4 inches in diameter but the filling portions are generous). It was the fat little fish sticks that served as the filling --  all I could taste was the batter! By my second taco, I was trying to pick the batter off and come the third - I just gave up and left it in hopes of enjoying dessert.  Dessert was good - I had the churros on the recommendation of the many Yelp reviews I had read and they were OK. I actually preferred the fried bananas - more specifically, the peanut butter mousse that they were plated with!   OK, I was going to give this place 2 stars but I'm going to round up to 3 with a caveat: For dinner, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" but for sharing a cheese plate, maybe some pozole, a couple margaritas or a romantic setting for dessert with a bottle of wine, it's \"A-OK.\"",

We split the grilled Romain salad which was delicious ...Yum...  especially the black beans. Whatever you do, try the Grilled Street Corn, it was the best corn we've ever eaten! The Roast Corn Gordita were delicious too and the Marinated Jidori Chicken good. My wife's Mahi mahi fish tacos were really the only thing that were just okay. But the presentation of everything was beautiful and the service was excellent even though the place was really really busy on a Sunday night. The seating is kind of crammed and jammed in... it was a little like we were sharing conversation with both of the couples on either side of us so that's the only not perfect part of the atmosphere. But it's a lively place an we think it's worth a try if you like latin flavors.",

Greeted by the hostess with a friendly \"happy anniversary! \" she seated us right away on the back patio. The patio was  romantic, strung tastefully with clear lights,  lush greenery, and a charming fountain.   Our server came to greet us immediately. I was incredibly impressed with how much knowledge our server had about the menu(looks like a foreign language) and his ability to help me understand what everything was and what it would taste like. Looking over the drink menu there are so many great options, but I had to try their avocado margarita. Who knew avocados and tequila could go so well together!?  I had the tostadas to start; three crunchy delicious tostadas with all kinds of cheese, chicken, and yummy sauce. I had the salmon for my main entree, I've never had a better cooked piece of fish. Our server was always available to answer questions and always kept our waters and cocktails full.  All I can say is thank you to the entire staff of The Mission for creating such a memorable night for me and my hunny. We can't wait to be back!",

There is a warm ambiance in the darkened restaurant. The lighting is very well done but it might be at some times a little too dark. The illuminated Himalayan Salt rock brick wall ( I read this some place in the reviews) is very beautiful.  Waiting staff friendly.  Chips and salsa and guacamole very tasty. Margaritas were good but I might not choose the Tecate one with the muddled avocado next time. Not limey enough.  I had the Malbec Braised Shortrib: richly marinated and deliciously slow cooked with a wonderful red pepper chimichurri. The crispy quest fresco potatoes were somewhat undercooked for me.  Our friend had the Shrimp and Creekstone Beef Anticuchos: the shrimp were simply delicious while the beef was tasty but not on the tender side.  In the meantime the restaurant was getting full, busy and loud. As the lights got dimmer the noise level got higher. (saturday night). My husband had the Chorizo Porchetta, delicious pork shoulder. The sweet garlic crema finished it off.  All dishes were very nicely presented and served.  Ah, the desserts: All good I take one half star away for the noise level and it being quite dark. But on the other hand the darkness gives a romantic flair.  The food is good, the people are nice. I say: GO!",

    "text": "We LOVE the mission.  It is one of our favorite places to go for guac and sangria.  That being said - yesterdays experience could not have been more disappointing.  We were seated outside - which was great.  20 minutes between when we were seated and when someone actually spoke to us.  5 minutes later, the water arrives.  At that point a DIFFERENT waitress then our own comes up and can sense our being annoyed and very nicely asks if she can help.  She takes our drink order.  10 more minutes go by and she again comes up and says \"no one has brought you your drinks\"...to which we say no, and finally several minutes later our regular waitress comes up with the drinks (we are now over 30 minutes into this ordeal) and smiles and acts like nothing has happened.  I overheard two other tables complaining of the same - it was 3 in the afternoon - its not like they were overly busy!  Outside tables were full in the front of the restaurant but about 40% full inside and outback.  So as we were frustrated, we discussed how one of the unfornate things about YELP is that managers of restaurants are not given the opportunity to fix things at the time of the event.  So we talk to the manager and let him (BRYAN ADAMS) what has transpired.  He appologizes and says he wants to do something for us.  We say that isnt really necessary, as that is not the point of the complaint.  He insists, and says he will speak to our server and adjust our bill.  We proceed to pay the unadjusted bill when it arrives because just like our server, he does NOTHING about this.    Note to the mission....when you are paying $12 for a bowl of guac, no matter how good it is, people are going to stop coming if you cant get it right.  The only saving grace for the MIssion yesterday was the younger friendlier waitress that seemed to care more than the waitress or the manager.",

The papaya salad was downright sad.  The short rib had a great texture and sprung when you could find a pepper to pair it with.  The chimichurri hangar steak was good but very standard for what you would find at any Argentinean restaurant.  During this -- my second -- Scottsdale trip, I tried as many guacamole dishes and tequilas as possible in four days.  The reposado flight here had a lot of turbulence.  The Sol de Mexico and Corralejo were both good; but the Milagro and Maestro tequilas were extremely harsh, reminding me of regrettable nightclubs in Tijuana offering shots from Dixie cups . . . not what I would expect for $6.00 a shot.  But the design, guests, and waitresses are all beautiful.  The hostesses are charming and accommodating.  I think the overall feel is just trendy fun.",

    "text": "We've eaten here twice for the brunch menu served on Saturday and Sunday. The first time was good, we were seated quickly, ordered quickly got our food quickly and while there was no rush to get our big party out the door, we left quickly because it was a SF Giants game day at Scottsdale Stadium. The second time we came though, it was bad. We were seated fast again which was nice. We ordered and then we waited for our food. The appetizers came and were devoured, but then we waited forever for our main entrees. You might say \"but when you have ten people it will take longer!\" But in my mind ten people, 7 of which ordered the tacos and the other 3 dishes were a torta, the waffles, and a soup, should not slow the kitchen to a crawl. When asked about the wait, an hour after we sat down, the waitress simply said \"oh it can take up to 40 minutes, but your food should be out soon!\" (40 minutes for TACOS? Tiny little street tacos that the food truck at the farmer's market can get to you in less than 5 minutes!?). Another 20 minutes passed... Other tables around us, ones sat AFTER us got their tacos and were eating... Finally a whole hour and ten minutes after we were sat at our table, (roughly 55 minutes after ordering!) we got our food! The tacos were small and not that great, the soup was large and tasted alright, the torta was mediocre, and the waffles were just okay. All in all the food was not worth the money or the wait. Save your time and money and hit up any other of the numerous taco/Mexican food joints Scottsdale has to offer.",

    "text": "The Mission had me for a moment. The inside was so dark, our waitress looked overworked and the table-side guacamole inspired an eye roll from me for its gimmickiness.   I suppose if you go there to romance someone the candle lit dimness sets a certain kind of ambience. But if you are there like me to get some serious grub, the darkness is just plain annoying.   Ok now lets talk about food. Its just too bad the other half and I are not big eaters, otherwise we would have ordered a lot more than the table-side guacamole, kale salad, street corn and mahi mahi tacos.  The eye-rolling-inducing guacamole is nothing to write home about. Something one can easily make at home or get in one of the many tacquerias for half the price. Now, the Kale Salad. Ah the Kale Salad with its julienned- cut kale, cleverly sized bits of blood orange, roasted peppitos, peeled whole little tomatoes and dressing that erred a little to the overwhelming side.  This is one of those meals that made me think about the process of creating the food. Man, I wish I knew how to perfectly peel the skin of a little tomato without crushing the tomatoes or how do I take the bitterness of uncooked kale into a salad that has a myriad of wonderful textures and flavor. I really really appreciated the bitter chewy bits of the blood orange because by itself would have made me upset but paired with the rest of the salad, the combo just worked.  Did I mention I really like this salad?  The Mahi Mahi Taco was interesting. The juxtaposition of the large battered mahi with the tiny taco made me wonder but when I bit into it, I understood the intention was to highlight the fish and the other condiments compliment the fish.  Too bad I don't like greasy fish too much, otherwise I'd enjoy this dish a bit more.  I asked my Street Corn to be stripped from its cob. I like corn. I am guessing the appeal of this side dish is the mayo-based sauce. Meh. I am okay with it.  I'd give 4 stars for the Kale Salad alone but service plus darkness.. hmm 3 stars is generous.",

We did wait a bit for a server (there was confusion over the sections), who while cute and bubbly tried very hard, but wasn't the best server I've had...especially in Old Town.  My boyfriend and I ordered drinks and the guacamole appetizer.  All were good; however for the amount of people in the restaurant took too long to arrive.  I had the Chorizo porchetta (I believe it was called) and my boyfriend had the 1/2 chicken with fries.  Both meals were good, but not impressive.  If I hadn't been here before for a good happy hour I wouldn't likely pick this place again especially as the thing I was impressed with the most with was the decor...and even that was too dark for me to read my menu with ease!",

If you're from say the Midwest you'll find this place to be incredible. As Mexican food goes it is alright in my book. The atmosphere is what makes this place a three star review because the food is not the best. The table side guacamole is good, but the tacos are blah. The tacos are smaller than street tacos and the taste ranges from blah to okay.   Come here for the atmosphere, drinks, and guacamole.

Our group enjoyed a 3-course meal which included a sweet, savory and crunchy pork belly lettuce wrap. It was heavenly. Second came the kale salad. I wasn't too much of a fan, but it seemed to pretty popular with my dining companions. It's probably a matter of preference as it was accompanied with a unique tangy dressing. Lastly, we had various tacos. Sounds simple, but they were a far cry from your typical tacos. Seasoned, juicy and garnished with toppings the chicken, beef and pork were anything but ordinary. On top of great food, the ambiance is reason enough to drop by. Apparently Autumn in Arizona means pretty much perfect weather. Their gorgeous patio is a large, romantic dining option that added that much more to our overall experience.",

Except they don't allow mixing the kinds so you have to have three of each, which gets old after two, if that were your entree.  We had the salmon plate and chicken plate as our entree, both very good, beautiful presentation,  but extremely small portions and a little under seasoned.  We didn't have a desert as they didn't seem very interesting.  Over all, nice but not worth the price.",

To top it all off, we were furious that they charged us something like $8 for each bowl of chips and salsa at the table. We had a big group and basically each couple paid $8. This didn't include guacamole. It was just for chips and salsa, which had been free the first 100 times I've come here! The server really rang us up a bill.

    "text": "Visiting Scottsdale, I was looking for the best restaurant in the area and The Mission definitely did not disappoint! I ate at the bar on a busy Friday night and had fantastic service from both bartenders. The duck empanadas were out of this world good, even better when washed down with one of their margaritas. Those alone, although they may look small, were plenty for a dinner by themselves. I did have to the guacamole too but it was about average to me. I'd like to come back with company next time, this was such a pleasant surprise!",

We went there on a Saturday during brunch expecting a long wait but they got us seated within ten minutes!    What we ordered:  Table side Guacamole: excellent and fresh! Street Corn: went along nicely with the guacamole  And then for our main entrees we each shared: Mahi Mahi tacos: one of the best mahi mahi tacos I've ever had! Crispy Rock Shrimp tacos: average but still good Tecate Skirt Steak tacos:  different from what we expected but was delicious!  For drinks we had the strawberry banana margarita.   Service was friendly and polite. We didn't even tell them it was my friend's birthday because we didn't think that they did anything special for birthdays, but when our waitress saw my friend's birthday card on the table she had dessert immediately sent out for the birthday girl when we told her it was okay.   Overall, great food, great service, great ambiance. Would definitely come back again!",

If you're spending your own cash you can do much better than $100 for two people to have tacos, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks.  That said, for a swanky night out or a special occasion you can't go wrong.",

We sat near the bar at the high tables. The interior decor was rather interesting with religious symbols but in a cool rugged way. Our server was extremely attentive.  Food: I heart guacamole and this place makes it fresh. We ordered a few appetizers and the popular pulled pork dish. Pretty filling by the time I took my last sip of wine.   Overall: I used to live in AZ during my college years and food wasn't the most memorable. So I'll give some credit to this place.",

    "text": "I have to start by saying in my entire life of going out and experiencing restaurants all over the country and the world, I have never ever been so disrespected and mistreated as I have been here. Yesterday was my 30th birthday, a day I feared and looked forward to for a very long time and after having an amazing weekend in Scottsdale eating at amazing restaurants such as Cafe Monarch, Citizen Public house and Steak 44 I had decided to leave the Mission to celebrate my actual bday dinner. I had made reservations maybe 2 months ago for a dinner with my family including two toddlers for a 5:30 NON rush hour spot specifically asking for a nice table because I would be celebrating such a big bday. The day came and they had confirmed my reservation and I had nicely asked for a table outside since it's a little nicer to be with my family as their inside is so dark and the music is blasting and the guy on the phone told me no problem we will get you a nice table outside.   We arrived on time, yep right on the dot and the restaurant was almost empty on the inside and half empty outside so I thought there would be no problem in accommodating my one request to sit outside. Their hostess was cold, no smile, attitude as large as camelback mountain, she just said sorry NO, just sit inside. She basically wanted to put us in a dark area of the restaurant where there was no people. I asked for a manager because I could not believe this kind of service I was getting at this point and I regret because what followed was just disgusting and inhumane.   This manager on duty on November 6th is a ruthless, pathetic lack of a person. He didn't care that it was my bday, he probably has something against toddlers (even though mine behave very well) and also, not sure where he is from, but we all had the feeling he has something against women since he spoke to me in a demeaning and very condescending way. I think the owners of this establishment should be ashamed in hiring someone who knows nothing about customer service and customer appreciation. I explained my situation and he said first \"sorry, nothing I can do you can go to another restaurant of ours and sit outside there.\" I explained to him that I have children and it's hard to carry them around town from one restaurant to the next. He just didn't care. I also told him that out of all the restaurants in Scottsdale I chose this one to celebrate my day, again he didn't care. I even promised if he sat us outside (which again was half empty) we would be out by 7pm to accommodate \"all this future reservations.\" Nope, he said can't do anything but to sit you inside. I found a round table inside and couldn't believe how rude he has been these past 20 minutes which we could have already started eating outside but I honestly didn't have the energy to argue anymore. So as we almost sat down he said in a sarcastic tone \"I'm glad I was able to help you.\"   I thought to myself wow, you have got to be kidding me, he has done nothing but mistreat my parents in their 60s by having them stand with two toddlers while I tried to get us a table I made more than 2 months ago. I said no, you did not really help us. He said \"if you don't like it, you can get the hell out of here\" wow, I was shocked. I was just about to be defeated and sit inside of this empty restaurant on the inside. A man who was so egotistical who knew it was almost 6pm now on a Sunday evening during high season just basically kicked us out of a restaurant and then told me \"I know nothing about how the restaurant industry works.\" He knew I would have a hard time getting a reservation anywhere special last minute but he still kicked us out. This is not Latin America or Europe, this is the damn UNITED STATES where we strive to make customers feel appreciated.   Well let me tell you something to that evil man who has no compassion for anyone but himself.   A. We were lucky enough to get in somewhere very good (LAST MINUTE) a place that respects people of all ages.  B. One thing I truly know about the restaurant business is that number one is customer service which you have NONE OF. People come back based on experiences not just by your food.  C. You will also never succeed anywhere beyond a manager position when act like a chauvinistic piece of ***t. Pardon my language Yelp. But being from Chicago and knowing many successful restaurant owners, there is no way anyone would promote or work with someone who treats people the way you do.   I would obviously never come back here just from my experiences of talking to two people here. It was something I wish I never experienced in my 30 years and hopefully never will again. In hindsight I should feel sorry for people who can be so rude to you for no apparent reason, must have some personal problems and he has to take it out on the rest of the world.",

It was basically the same duck you would find anywhere but with a nice green chili sauce. It was good, but not worth the wait.  The item not to kiss is the table side guacamole service.  Small portion of guac but oh so good.  Don't forget to try the ghost pepper sauce, a very small portion at a time.  It goes great mixed with the guac. Get a reservation unless you like to wait 2 to 3 hours on a week night.  I can't imagine a weekend.",

We also had Duck Carnitas Empanada: duck, foie gras, orange, habanero, oregano, mushroom, and queso oaxaca and pork shoulder tacos with a pineapple glaze served with handmade corn tortillas. The tortillas were placed on top of a large brick to keep them warm. We also enjoyed a side of fresh corn made with butter, chile paprika & cotija. It typically comes on the cob, but we made a special request to have it shaved.  Very hipster & trendy vibe.  Right up my alley.  What a great looking group of people dining at this awesome establishment, except none were Asian.  Yeah they're lacking with the Asians in Arizona.  At any rate, I can totally see Bobby Flay dining at this joint.",

I love guacamole & don't usually order table side because I make my own at home all the time but we did order it and it was hands down the best I have ever had!! We had the guacamole guy add a hint of the ghost sauce & it was out of this world!! Chorizo pork was a good meat dish beautifully plated with a flaming sprig of rosemary.  Margaritas were good and flavors were well balanced & described with perfection but pricey. Their wines selections are nice reserves. Unique ones including selections from Darioush.   Beautiful atmosphere! Love the salt block wall back lit by kitchen, nice effect. The only disappointment is the very high price. It WAS nice and a lovely evening. But prices were very steep. We will go back again someday & enjoy another night at the Mission. But not a regular stop at $200 a pop!",

Get the table side guac, definitely go for medium it's not spicy at all but the mild is too bland.   Sides - street corn (ask for it off the cob) and the white bean puree are to die for. I have recreated the latter dish at home because it's so good.   Chicken and skirt steak tacos are delicious. Yes, the tacos are small but get a few sides to share with the table.   Drinks are decent but overpriced. $14 for a margarita? This isn't a big metropolitan city, calm down on the prices.   Chips are thin and crispy and the salsa is AMAZING.   Wait staff is nice, waiter brought a napkin to put on the ground under my purse. Very nice touch.   Pro Tip: If the weather is nice, then sit on the patio. The dining room is very dark, loud and crowded. It's a bit hard to hear. Make a reservation because they fill up fast!",

We started off with the guacamole which was one of the best we have ever had.  They do tableside guacamole here so it's great to customize the taste however you like it.  I shared the mahi mahi tacos with a friend and we loved every bite of ours.  The tortilla was super small, they were kind of like tapas style, but I loved that regardless of how small the tortilla was they filled a lot in that small tortilla!  The taste was exceptional.  The other thing that I loved here were the chips and salsa, the chips are extra crispy and the salsa had the perfect amount of spice in it.  Our waiter was phenomenal as well.... Jeremy...thank you for such a great time!  We also got dessert at the end which was delicious.  I don't like dessert that is too sweet and their pumpkin bread with ice cream on top had the perfect amount of sweetness to it for me!  We also had chocolate milkshake with churros in them, YUM!!!!!!!  I will be day dreaming about this meal for many months...haha",

    "text": "Have been here twice, both times wonderful. Sat on the back patio the first time and inside the second. We were seated at a spot in the back near the vines which was awkward. One of our party of four repeatedly got her hair stuck in said vines and another person (with a small build) had to ask another table if she could pull out her chair because it was so close to ours. It was very busy but never had to wait for a seat. There is a free parking lot across the street, which is very convenient.   Service both times was friendly and efficient. Specific people dedicated to drink and chip refills and bussing empty plates. Table side guac is amazing and you pick your spice level and can omit certain ingredients (onion for us). The street corn is so freaking tasty with an unexpected kick. We got it cut off the cob, which made it easy to share. Big, individual bowls of salsa and complimentary warm chips are doled out. Yummy but spicy. Brings a tissue! :-)  The street tacos are small but wonderful. We ordered different tacos and shared and they wee all so delicious. My favorite is definitely the rock shrimp but you can't really go wrong. Hubby got the pork tacos today and really liked them. The pork was super tender and flavorful (BBQ flavorings). The chipotle grits he ordered were okay but mostly a miss. Greasy and overly spicy, thus we wouldn't order again. The biggest disappointment today was the kids chicken quesadilla we ordered for our toddler. It was $11, typical quesadilla, with no sides or drink included(although they brought him a foam, enclosed cup of water with no prompting). So pricey for hardly any cheese and a few huge chunks of chicken. No other meal options for kids.  We will definitely be back but will leave the kiddo at home or feed him before. House margarita was delicious as are the other items I mentioned. Pricey but worth it!",

    "text": "Brunch on a Sunday.... This was exactly what we were looking for!  Setting: The weather was perfect so we dined on the patio at a corner table with an umbrella. The corner table had bench seating on one side and chairs on the other and it was actually quite comfy. There's a raised planter in between you and the side walk to give a bit of separation from you and the street.  It's a fairly quiet street (even with Spring Training fans walking around) so it wasn't loud. Great place to hang out and relax.  Starters: Bloody Mary and Mimosas I had the BM... it was very good.  I wanted to order another one but figured I'd better \"be good\" and only have one. Mom sucked down her Mimosa.... She wanted another one too but she refrained.  :)  Fresh, Table-side Guacamole...  So!  Good! They make it to your preference... so if you don't like onions or cilantro or whatever then you can omit what you don't like.  But let me tell you... all the ingredients were Excellent.  We opted for Medium heat and it was perfect... the heat from the pepper balanced the creaminess of the avocados.... Oh and the roasted pepitas on top were like the \"can't live without sprinkles on a cupcake\".  Next time I make guac... I'm adding a a bit of pepitas.  These add a nice flavor, crunch and texture to the dip.  I ordered the Chicken Torta with an egg on top (it was brunch so I figured an egg would make it breakfast-y)... Mom ordered the Green Chilaquiles and the husband ordered the Chorizo Scramble.  The husband's Chorizo Scramble was good and the Chorizo had lots of flavor and a bit of a kick.  But overall, I was unimpressed with the dish.  It was your basic egg dish.  My Chicken Torta was really cheesy... I don't mean it was silly... I mean... there was lots of cheese on it.  This isn't a bad thing if you love cheese. I didn't realize this so next time (because there will be a next time)... I'll order something a little lighter.  This dish was meaty and filling.  I didn't recognize most of the ingredients but it sure was tasty... plus it had nice heat which made the cheese a little less overpowering.  It's a pretty big dish... I didn't finish it... so the husband helped me out.  Mom's Green Chilaquiles was Awesome!  BIG too!  I called them Gourmet Nachos.  Just thinking about them makes my mouth water.  If you're adventurous and have never tried these before.... Order these with a beer.  Total comfort food.  :)  Service: Great! Super friendly and accommodating. Since we were one of the first for brunch ... they let us pick where we wanted to sit.",

    "text": "4-Star: Food quality/preparation 3.5-Star: Ambiance 2-Star: Value 1-2-Star: Service  If you are a mainstream diner looking for a quick meal and overpriced wine list, then give it a try, the food is good.  But.....if you have ANY kind of dietary and/or dining challenges or requirements or want to linger at your table with a drink and/or conversation (even on slow days), you might want to dine elsewhere.  Many items do not list all their ingredients; you need to ask the server who, depending on the server, will either be accommodating or impatient in helping you select appropriate items and meeting your dining expectations.  We got the impatient one.  Our meal ended up being more of a Gobble 'n Go (overly hasty service as compared to the other tables around us) than a relaxing afternoon experience.  Then, if you pay your bill with cash, be sure not to say \"thank you\" at any time because the server will assume all the cash is for them and not bring you any change, leaving you to either appear a tightwad in asking \"where's my change?\" or end up leaving them more than the 20% you had intended to leave, which was more than their service merited in the first place.    PS:  Bring a cellphone with a light to read the menu.  Are we going back?  Not hardly.  Pity - we're locals and we've been there before, but now it seems to be declining.",

I would totally recommend eating family style here, as our waiter (who was really nice) suggested. That way you get to try everything & order tortillas on the side.   Of course we had to get the tableside guac and the corn! They were both really good & I recommend you get it. We also got a duck confit which was good. Then we had duck, chorizo, and short rib, all of which were good, and we had mahi mahi tacos which I really enjoyed! For dessert we ordered the espresso churros (so good) and the banana dish (even better!). I loved the food here and left very full & happy!

    "text": "Tried this Latin American spot with out-of-town guests for the first time this weekend and I definitely plan to return. The Mission would be a great place for date night; it's upscale without being pretentious, and the low-lighting, candles, and chandeliers provide a nice, sexy atmosphere.   We started with the tableside guacamole, which was incredible! Flavorful and creamy, with a great smoky heat from the chipotle. Hands down beats all the other guacamole I've had in town - including Barrio Cafe's - and I'm quite the guac snob because I make a mean version of it myself. The drinks were great too, we just had a couple rounds of house margaritas which were refreshing and on the strong side, but I'm looking forward to trying other margaritas from their extensive drink menu upon my return.   The staff was friendly, prompt, attractive, unobtrusive - pretty much everything I look for in servers. Service was a tad on the slow side, but that didn't bother me because I was enjoying the food and company and it was a Friday night after all.   I had the fish tacos which were crunchy and inventive, and also a relatively normal-sized portion. I know I'm in the minority in our indulgent society, but I appreciate it when a plate of food arrives that doesn't overwhelm/disgust me with its sheer magnitude. One of my dinner companions had a pork dish and said it was the best cooked pork he'd had in a long time so I'm sure you can't go wrong with their pork dishes, either.   I definitely recommend The Mission. It's not your traditional Mexican fare, but it's a great Latin American alternative when you're looking for something beyond your typical burrito, in a cozy, intimate environment.",

However it can be a little noisy weekends so it may be a little difficult to communicate on a date or whoever your company is. The only things I would say is your going to have to pay to really enjoy the Mexican food. It's fine dining Mexican and yes it exists believe or not in Scottsdale. No 2.50 bean burrito is sold here. Anyway I had the soup which was rich and creamy with seafood mixed in but not worth $14. The chips and salsa were tasty and the hot salsa was very good with a kick. Portions are small yet very filling. Another con is the seats are hard and not very comfortable. I saw some people getting they're cell phones out to look at the menu because it's so dark inside. So if you get to dine in the patio do it because it's a great atmosphere. My server was black and very professional he knew the menu hands down and was on top of our table the whole time.",

We started with skewered chicken and beef satay and they were savory, tender and perfect to the taste.. The Duck Carnitas Empanada ($12) was also a great way to start. Whether you do tapas or a full meal, there is plenty to choose from. Some of my favorites were the Malbec Braised Short Ribs ($19) and Scallops ($28).

I had the Chilaquiles (corn tortillas, pork, egg, cojita) and have never quite tasted anything like it. A combination of flavors with a little bit of spice. The plate had a very nice portion as well. Good value for $9.  My wife had the corn pancakes with crab and loved the meal.  I made an executive decision to also order the homemade granola, yougurt and tropical fruit. This dish was superb. I was a bit disappointed that the menu listed the fruit options as pineapple, mango and papaya and when the plate arrived there were blueberries instead of the papaya. Mix in the fruit, yogurt and granola and we had a nice complement to our main meal.  The service was good. We had to wait awhile for our food. A table next to us ordered well after me, and ended up getting their food at least 10 minutes before. That was upsetting, because we were both very hungry! At least the waitress came over and said the food was on its way and thanked us for our patience.  The inside is very nice and has a cool decor.   There is a small patio outside and a full bar inside.  4.5 stars",

    "text": "I dined here for the first time, while on vacation, because of all the good Yelp reviews.   The atmosphere is tranquil looking but loud with a mixed aged-crowd. It is apparently customary to be given a small light to look over the menu, because it is so dark . Our server did not offer us one , even after she saw me using my phone.  Being our first time, (and we even told her it was our first time) she did not run through any specials or anything. I had to ask and she just told me the Chef's recommendation.  The server next to us told his table all the specials that evening. The guacamole was different with the toasted pepitas in it. It had a nice flavor. I had the chicken tacos and ordered flour tortillas vs corn. It would have been nice to have been told that I would have had to put everything together myself, vs if I had ordered them with corn tortillas. It came with two flour tortillas and a bowl with the chicken and avocado and then a side of the sauce. The chicken was  a tad dry and overcooked. I have had better tacos elsewhere. The blood orange pineapple margarita was the best thing I had there.  The server was not very inviting and seemed uninterested in helping us . She only came around to take the order and check how the guacamole was and then handed us our bill.  I think there needs to be some improvement on the service. I would try it again and ask for a different server.",

The claimed house special is pork shoulder. Unfortunately, I came away disappointed. It was dry from the long smoke which means the meat was not wrapped or injected. Apps were good to very good and the guac was very good. Nice blend of jalapenos, Serrano and chipotle puree. Overpriced but at least every dish is made to order.",

We ordered a sampling of nearly everything on the menu, and everything we ordered was wonderful.    Some of our favorite dishes were - guacamole made at the table (medium spice), short rib tacos, mahi mahi tacos, pork belly appetizer, and bread pudding.  I had the avocado margarita and was pleasantly surprised that it was a really good margarita.  One of our friends ordered one of the tequila flights, and he said it was the best value he'd ever seen - 4 very nice samplings of tequila and great quality for a great price.  The decor was nice, and we were especially taken by the wall of Himalayan salt bricks.  It really is a sight to see with the lighting behind the bricks shining through. The one negative was that we were at a table with a HUGE painting sticking out from the wall that was a little intrusive, but it didn't ruin our meal by any means.  If you're ever in old town Scottsdale, I recommend you go to The Mission.  It's a good picture taking opportunity too with the mission building next door.",

    "text": "Since moving here, I needed to find the perfect \"special dinner\" place. You know what I mean, we all have one. It is our go to place for a special event, birthday, date or family visit. And while I have not had that many special events yet, I have had some family visits. And my parents only stay at the Saguaro hotel when they come to Phoenix. But more on that later.   So whenever they are in town, we will go to The Mission. It is just a great place for a nice dinner without it being too stuffy. While every meal I have had there has been great, I cant honestly remember what I ate. But I do remember the guacamole. As a fat foodie, I love when a dish is prepared table side. And they do this for the guacamole, and it is the best guacamole I have ever had. How do I know this? I hate guacamole. I try to never eat on purpose, but when I go to The Mission that part of me dies. And I inhale this stuff. So you have to try the guacamole is what I am getting at. And order their house margarita or their Blood Orange margarita (if it is still on the menu). Another thing that becomes costly, because they go down so smooth and taste so good before you know it your a little drunk.   I have never had service problems. And both times I have gone, it has been packed. And while it does get loud, you can still hear yourself. Try to get a seat outside in the back. Nothing fancy about it but it just a great outside setting that is not patio or Jimmy Buffet themed (sorry, tex-mex places with outdoor seating usually go down the Buffet route).   Also the drinks are not watered down. Trust me.",

I can't even imagine what the average built adult would think about them...  Specialty cocktails were good, but pricey. Entree entirely too small to satisfy any amount of hunger and overpriced (I'm serious, the \"tortillas\" are the size of Ritz crackers; this is not an entree but hors d'oeuvres).   Ambiance was nice, beautifully lit and decorated, dark, Catholic inspired, chandeliers, etc. There's a full bar and seating is nice.  Service was...eh, nothing special. They took our chips and salsa away long before we were even close to being done with them an didn't ask prior.  The desserts were way bigger than any entree I saw and were mediocre at best.   The food itself tasted good, but there was NOWHERE near enough to satisfy any person in just one serving.  If you want insanely overpriced appetizers masquerading as real food, you'll like this place.",

    "text": "After a long day on our business trip in Phoenix, my friend and I looked up a good place to relax and hang out for dinner and came across Mission on Yelp. We decided to stop by this place at around 6pm and, boy...this place was full aleady! There was a line already coming out of the restaurant...and as we inquired, it would already be another 1.5 hr of wait time! Luckily, there was just the last 2 spots left at a bar, so we decided to just grab those spots to forgo the actual restaurant seatings. There at the bar, we were able to order restaurant food as well....so we opted for (...ready for this?....*drum rolls**):  appetizer: table-top guacamole crispy pork pork belly  main course: duck confit pork taco  dessert: pumpkin bread pudding with fresh pomegrenate toppings  yea...I know...we were total pigs..but hey..the food was so good!! They brought out all the ingredients and customized the table-top guacamole for us according to how spicy we wanted it and what we wanted in there. The crispy pork/pork belly were also bite sizes (though still in good portions!)...and were delicious treats to us! I love the food there so much even though after eating all those dishes...I felt like I could never really have any Latin American/Mexican food for the next few months! The biggest let down though was the pumpkin bread pudding. It really didn't taste like bread pudding at all. It tasted more like pumpkin bread soaked in some sort of syrup and just topped with fresh pomegrenate seeds.  If I ever get to go there again, I would just skip desserts and only go for appetizers/main coruses there. Total damage to our wallet (e.g. cost without tip) was around $130, including soda/2 cocktails.  By the time we left (8:30pm), the bar/restaurant were both completely packed! I saw a couple waiting for a table just anywhere (bar/restaurant) and I felt like they must have been waiting at least 1+ hour! yikes!!  so...suggestion to all,...go early! eat lots..and be merry! :)",

When the food, service, and ambiance are all in sync, you have yourself one fantastic restaurant on your hands. My recs would be the table side guac, shrimp tacos, street corn, grilled prawn salad, and the peruvian clam soup!!!!! I am in love with that soup! You can't go wrong with anything though! Oh and the margaritas are top notch, especially the Primarita. It is more expensive but so worth it! I also love the red sangria.   The curros are also mind blowing.

Frankly, great concept by way of decor...but a bit too pretentious for my taste.

    "text": "Make sure you get SAM as your waiter...He is one of the best servers I have ever had and absolutely made my dinner experience awesome.  I am very happy to have been able to visit The Mission on my first visit to Scottsdale.  I had a late dinner reservation at 8:45 on a Friday and expected the restaurant to be halfway empty, but when I arrived, I was glad I had a reservation as it was packed and people were still flowing in.  There was another party in front of us when we walked in, but immediately we were also greeted by staff/manager to note our party size.  After mentioning our reservation, the hostess was notified to get us our table.  Service so far so good.  Everything on the menu sounded so good, we really needed some recommendations for our first time.  Sam was amazing and explained the entire menu with recommendations to the most popular dishes including history and back stories on the dishes including info on the chef.  After hearing everything, I really wished there was a tasting menu, and after hearing that, Sam offered to order for me.  I didn't go for it this time, but next time I'll definitely trust Sam.  FOOD  STARTERS / TAPAS Almejas Al Vapor peruvian clam stew + rock shrimp + chorizo + pan de yucca + aji amarillo + roast corn. Spicy. Very interesting flavors, curry-like.  I loved that it was spicy, but leave some time after this to cool the palate.  Crispy Cola Pork pork belly + cola + lime + chiltepin + peanut + pickled red onion + gem lettuce. Like a lettuce wrap taco - solid.  Duck Carnitas Empanada duck + foie gras + orange + habanero + oregano + mushroom + queso oaxaca. My Favorite Dish of the night.  This one empanada is huge, could be an entree.  Great flavors, amazing orange glaze. Could have a thinner crust, but I suspect its because the thing is too thick with duck meat.  ENTREES Chimmichurri Marinated Hanger Steak pan de bono + charred leek & scallion soubise + tomatillo salad. Cooked a perfect medium rare, but unfortunately it was pretty under seasoned.   Scallop Tacos - 3 large diver scallops on a 3in tortilla.  Just ok, a little salty and just a tad overcooked.  I preferred a medium rare scallop.  DESSERT Pumpkin Bread Pudding scotch + pepitas + pomegranate. Second best dish of the night.  Fresh, hot bread pudding melts in your mouth.  Fantastic, original dessert.  DRINKS I told Sam what I like to drink and he recommended an amazing tequila.  If you like cognac or bourbon, you'll like the Corrido anejo and extra anejo.  The extra anejo is something special with hints of vanilla and caramel.  This was my favorite dinner during my visit to Arizona.  Better that Cowboy Ciao imo.  A great place to drink with friends too.  If I return to Arizona, I am definitely coming back.",

The wine was good and our waitress was nice. We chatted with a few groups of people who were next to us and had a pleasant time until.....my husband only slightly raised his voice (the place was loud to begin with) just to ask our friend a few tables over what he would like to drink so we can order them something. The manager immediately rushed over and said \"this is a family place\" (as if we did something inappropriate), it was also 11:30 and no children were around. He said you need to lower your voice or just leave. We were shocked as were the people next to us that told him we did nothing wrong. We said we just got our glasses of wine and wanted to order a drink for our friend. He said \"you are not staying to drink your wine and I'll pay for it-just leave\". I told him my husband did not yell across the restaurant and he said I had to run out of my office because I heard you. This was shocking to everyone around us and extremely rude. We will never recommend this place to anyone or ever return because of the horrible manager.",

    "text": "OMG.  So incredibly good and very consistent.  This place is hands down my absolute favorite place in Scottsdale.  Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food, great servers, great owners, what more can you ask for??  I visited the Mission the first time for Valentine's Day dinner when my boyfriend took me based on Yelp reviews.  We weren't sure what exactly we were getting ourselves into, but we took advice from many reviewers for the pork shoulder tacos.  We ended up getting the chips and salsa, a cheese plate, the pork shoulder tacos, a side of chipotle grits and ended with the pumpkin bread pudding.  Needless to say we were stuffed, but extremely happy.  We went back last night to take some friends who recently moved to the area, and they left just as happy as we did the first time.  My boyfriend and I wanted to branch out and get something new, but we had the best meal the first time that we did a repeat for round 2, although we got the churros instead of the bread pudding which were delish.  Sometimes you remember something tasting perfectly, and then you get it again and it doesn't quite live up to your mind's expectations.  Well, the Mission know's what's up.  It was just as good, if not better, than last time.  There is a reason this place has so many reviews, it practically speaks for itself.  I would highly recommend the pork shoulder tacos, the chipotle grits (so money) and some type of dessert.  They have a great bartender too - I had the strawberry coconut mojito, and it was tasty.  Their margs are pretty good too.  I can't wait to go back and maybe, just maybe, try something else!",

Don't skip the pumpkin bread pudding either.  The guacamole was good, definitely not the best I've ever had, but worth ordering.  The flour tortillas were hand-made and warm.  The drinks were STIFF and tasty.  One margarita had my wheels rolling.  Staff were helpful and service was great.  We will almost always try a new place, but we definitely will go back to The Mission when we get to Scottsdale.",

Everything was A++ - food, service, decor, ambiance, and especially the drinks.  The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night but with reservations we were seated immediately.  We started off with a couple of cocktails.  Everything sounded so amazing from the signature cocktail list.  I wanted to try all of them. Be sure to ask for the strawberry coconut mojito (it's not on the menu but the bartender can make it for you upon request).  It's incredible!  The food was absolutely delicious. Our appetizer was the Duck Carnitas Empanadas.  Something I normally wouldn't order but it was to die for! Then two of us split the Mango & Jimaca Salad  - light and refreshing.  Super yummy for the summer.   My entree was the Chilean Salmon.  It was served stacked in three small portions (but still plenty of food).  Cooked to perfection and the sauce was flavorful. Dessert is not to be missed! For dessert Espresso Churros and Pumpkin Bread Pudding. Don't be fooled by the name - it's not your typical Bread Pudding - it is to die for.  Everything was amazing and I was certainly full by the end of the meal.   One of the owners (Brian) stopped by our table. He couldn't have been nicer!  Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will definitely make it a point to come back to The Mission.",

Sat outside on the garden patio which was nice and quiet. Waiter was very passionate and enthusiastic about the restaurant so I was excited. He recommended any of the pork dishes since that is what the chef specializes in. Ordered guac for app.-was good. Just wasn't enough, but never is. Husband and I shared the pork tacos and was HUGELY disappointed. It says it serves two and comes with 10 tortillas. I never thought to ask how small the tortillas were. They were about the size of silver dollars and the pork shoulder fit in the palm of my mind. There definitely should've been a disclaimer on the menu since it cost $32!  I don't know what two people could share that but certainly not my husband and me! luckily I kept eating the chips and salsa but did not leave full at all. The sides cost extra as well so I did not think it was worth the money! The margarita was good and fairly priced compared to the food. I was bummed that this place did not meet my expectations and cost me $175 for 4 people with tip and drinks! I can certainly find a better, cheaper restaurant with much larger portions.",

From the moment we sat the service was nothing short of perfect. Sam quickly recommended some kids items and brought them out instantly. His passion for the restaurant, and for providing an amazing experience showed. The food was equally good and the menu was very fun and interesting. Drinks were cleverly mixed and a handsome pour to boot. We ordered tacos, soup and salad and a side of guacamole. The guacamole was prepared table side and tasted delectable! In short a first rate restaurant with excellent service and a memorable menu.",

    "text": "This is not a quick read, but fun- Memorial Day Weekend was spent in the Scottsdale area this year. The girls and I got to AZ and instantly needed Mexican Food. They being from Los Angeles and me from San Francisco. We met some friends at the pool and one of them recommended The Mission, as his good friend Brian owned the place, of course we went. Upon entering the Goth meets Catholic Church (in a GOOD WAY), adorned place we were seated immediately and greeted by what must be the BEST staff in Scottsdale. Noah the BRAVE and Brilliant was our server-one word-AWESOME! We were asked if we wanted drinks and while hemming and hawing about it, Noah recommended the Sangria. I ordered the White, because I KNOW about White Sangria, and two others in our party of 4 ordered the red. Soon they were sipping off OUR White Sangria and asking for replacements. It's not AT ALL that the red is not tasty, its that the White, is INDESCRIBABLE. wait...I'm yelping, I HAVE to describe it. It's like a Mango-Citrus Adult Starburst Candy!  Next came the ordering...I have NO idea what the other two ordered but we got the Pork Shoulder Tacos for two. OH MY GOD! SO good. The meat is perfectly tender and the corn tortillas are served on what I believe to be a heated stone. We had the Corn Tortillas, home made and RIDICULOUSLY good. Noah then brought us a side of the Black Bean Puree with sofrito + smoked ham hocks, AND the White Bean Puree with cotija + cumin + arugula + tomato. Both are delicious and hearty enough that you could get one of each and share. We were so impressed with our meal that night that we returned the next night, with our Scottsdale Pals-Palmer, Mister (aka Turbo/Sprinkler), and Ben. We were greeted by the friendly, down to earth and very HIP Brian Raab-owner. They were packed to the gills on a Saturday night Holiday Weekend but the bar had this GREAT Gothic Marble (?) family style table and we were seated there to wait for our \"real\" table. We never moved! BEST seat in the house for party's of 6 or more. \"Mission B.R\" (we give EVERYONE nicknames in Scottsdale)-the owner of this TRUE Gem of Scottsdale-, started to answer our questions about the menu, and then just said, \"you know what guys, if there are no food allergies, let me just bring you some stuff\". OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY...yes we did..... Out First: Just a FEW of the dishes brought to us, NOT kidding! -Lettuce Wraps (don't know if these are on the menu but they should be! A hint of what I think might have been Peanut Sauce is gorgeously delicious) -Mission Fries-SO fun and different. -Duck Carnitas Empanada-Topped with Foie Gras. THIS was by far my favourite starter. It was like Puff Pastry Perogies with Gravy and Rich decadent Foie Gras to top it off. Mini Tostadas-Precious tasty tapas. Shrimp Anticuchos-With a sauce to die for. Pork Confit -which was sincerely the most amazing texture and taste. This was almost reminiscent of baby back ribs with \"CRISP' to them-NO bones in this Confit, which according to MIssion B.R. is cooked all day in oil. Yesssssssssss.  ALL starter portions are HUGE-by San Francisco standards- and to be honest I was full after just the starters.  Main Courses: Just a few of them. -Malbec Braised Short Ribs-Decadent Pork FEAST with a Malbec sauce that I had to ask for the recipe. I was not given it ;)  -Pork Shoulder- SO supple and luscious, yeah I said it- I think this MIGHT be The Mission's Signature Dish. Pork FEAST! Porkalicious! -Chilean Salmon-This dish was smokey and mild and sat atop a. sweet/savory bean puree and light cream sauce. Buttery texture with perfectly carmalized edges. For fish lovers this dish is a must. -Uruguayan Filet-I don't think anyone got any of this because Turbo and I ate the WHOLE thing. One of the most inventive and original tasting Filet Mignon dishes I have ever had. VERY impressive. Desserts- I actually didn't taste any of these as I am allergic to sugar-SUX! However, if there were a sound feature on Yelp our table would have sounded like a porn movie. -Espresso Churros-Sounded like-ummm, ohhhhh, JESUS, oh Christmas Baby Jesus these are good. -Fried Bananas-Sounded like-moan, smack, slurp.... -A Brownie, Ice Cream, Chocolate Wet Dream thing.-Sounded like- HOLY GOD ALMIGHTY, oh oh oh oh oh oh HOOHHOHOHOHOHO GOD-DON'T STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So, in conclusion, if you happen to be in the Scottsdale area, EVER, The Mission is a must. They even have Fernet! Thanks Brian for a night to remember. AND Arizona men are the BEST. LOVE YOU PALMER, MISTER and BEN!!!!",

This restaurant is beautiful inside, with the beautiful chandeliers everywhere. They have great hardwood floors and travertine throughout, and a beautiful bar. There were no mistakes made in the design of this restaurant.   The food is expeptional, and they call it a modern latin american. A mix of Peruvian, Ecudorian, Brazilian, etc. I ordered the pork shoulder tacos, and while incredibly small for $14 they were the best tasting tacos I have had in a long time, and definitely on the unique side. They serve you three of them and they are about 2 inches across... very small corn tortillas. I want to try something else next time for a bigger meal.  The service was perfect, however I was the only one in the restaurant. This is my new favorite lunch spot in Old Town.

My friend and I each had the Chicaquiles, which were prepared wonderfully and served very promptly (hot plate!). I had a mimosa while waiting and while it was very good, with fresh squeezed orange juice, the eleven dollar setback for a single drink was a bit much. While we waited, the wait staff brought out a guacamole cart and prepared a bowl of it especially for us based on what we wanted in it. The ingredients looked very fresh and the guac was delicious.  I decided on some coffee with my breakfast and I must recommend it to anyone who enjoys a brunch with some java. Apparently (as told by our waitress) the coffee is a blend prepared for The Mission exclusively. It was definitely a highlight during the meal.  Our group ordered almost one of everything from the brunch menu and I heard no complaints about quality, quantity or freshness of what we received. I'm sure I will make another visit to this lovely establishment in the coming months, when I do, I'll be sure to update my review and add any new comments.",

    "text": "We decided to go to The Mission for my 24th birthday. When we first parked, we were having trouble finding the restaurant, so a nice guy asked what we were looking for. We told him we couldn't find The Mission, he smiled and told us to follow him. Along the way, he recommended several of their dishes. After we were seated, he came over... turns out it was the owner, Brian! He was such a sweet guy and even sent over chocolate cake at the end of the meal, complete with a sparkler.   The food was beyond delicious. I absolutely HATE guacamole, but their homemade guac was absolutely amazing... very complex and flavorful. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos, which were really good. My husband had the steak tacos and my parents had the pork shoulder tacos. Everything was so tasty and helped make it a really memorable evening.   What really made it, though, was how friendly and attentive the staff was. I was double impressed that Brian took the time to come over and talk with us. These are the little things that can make or break the dining experience.",

    "text": "We had reservations for the patio a few months back. We arrived on time, we seated promptly at a nice table and brought water immediately. However. It went down hill from there fast. Two different servers came up and introduced themselves as our servers. It felt rushed. We gave one our drink order, only to have the other come up and ask what we would like to drink. What...? The wine came a long while later. We put in an order for a jidori chicken appetizer with a server and some guac made table side. Both were good. For dinner we ordered the diver scallops and another chicken item. Right after one server took our order for entrees, another came up and dropped off dessert menus. What...? Did we not get our entree order in? We will never be sure when the entree orders were put in. Did the server forget? Why did we get dessert menus? It took almost an hour for entrees to come out. Which was fine as the appetizers filled us up. But still. Both entrees were good but I've had comparable food with proper service at other places. My scallops were perfect although I realized I wasn't a big fan of the set it was with. Boyfriend liked his chicken. We were planning to get dessert but after all was said and done I was full and completely turned off by the service. Our bill was somewhere around $130 before tip. I've worked fine dining, I'm still a server. This was the worst service I've ever had, not because the people weren't nice but because it was so chaotic and stressful and the energy was reflected onto the guests. Def not worth $160, which is a lot to us. Lastly, I forgot my sweater there and didn't realize until we got home. I called the restaurant and the host said they had it. I gave them my name and number and said I would be in the following day. I went to pick it up the next morning and it was no where to be found. Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Save your money. There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Old Town with service that isn't so stressful.",

    "text": "My first yelp review.  So upset after going to The Mission on our anniversary. We walk up to the entrance and encountered the tall, spiked hair, male employee who was blocking the patio entrance to the restaurant. He was advising everyone to try the House Brasserie and handing out their menu. It was very confusing, and he was only acknowledging certain people of the multiple people trying to get by him into the restaurant. We  finally made our way around the crowd after getting my feet stepped on and  spoke to the two female hostesses.  We were told it was a 45 minute wait. We were fine with this because we had not made a reservation. The bar was crowded so we went back out  front where there was a place to sit.  The bench where we were sitting was by the patio entrance. There we waited 45 minutes starring at a table on the patio that was available the entire time we waited. The hostesses texted us that our table was ready. As we were walking in, there was the spiked hair, male employee blocking the hostess station. He saw me walk up and did not acknowledge me and began to talk to a female who walked right in front of me. Eventually he turned to me and said \" you will have to wait a minute.\" Then, he turned to me and said \"are you trying to get a table tonight\"? At this point the female hostess are trying to look over him to talk to me but he would not budge his location. (Who is this guy? The bodyguard. He is not giving this restaurant a good first impression.) I assume because the hostesses recognized me, they said, \"wait here because we are preparing your table.\" We stood there and waited another 10 minutes. Then, the hostess proceeded to walk us to the very open table we had been starring at for 45 minutes. This was the table they were \"preparing for us\" for the last 10 minutes? It had been prepared and empty for about 55 minutes! When we told the hostess we did not want to sit at this table, she became visibly angry and hateful. We were reseated at another open table on the patio. I wish we had just left and gone elsewhere.  Yes, the guacamole was good and the gentlemen that made it was extremely nice but there was nothing else about the food or restaurant that seemed worth the snobbiness of the staff.",

    "text": "We arrived at the Mission having huge expectations based on good reviews. We waited at the bar and ordered a couple of their 14 dollar Margharitas. I watched as the bartender was making other drinks for the waiters and noticed she was short pouring the liquors in many drinks. I used to be a bartender so it was easy to notice. So my two 14 dollar Margharitas were  mediocre at best and must say that my wife makes a better Margharita hands down.  So we sit down at a table on the patio and proceed to order table side Guacamole where the tableside cart wont fit between the tables. So somewhere on the patio the guacolome was made . And it took 25-30 minutes to get the Guacomole served from the time we ordered it. Then we order scallops which are the worst I've tasted in sometime. The filet steak was good not great. They give you 3 bites of the poblano grits and 4 string beans like they might go broke if they fill the plate. When my wife gets done with her scallops she passes them over to me to finish. While I still have scallops on my plate the busboy comes over puts his hand on my plate and starts to remove my food without asking if I'm done. Not cool. I am not kidding but 2 minutes later the waitress comes over and starts to remove my plate without asking also. Needless to say I just wanted to get out of there. As Robert G said in his review they are trying to hustle you out when people are waiting. The manager did make good and removed scallops from the bill but the food is mediocre,the drinks are mediocre and the service sucks!!! I will never step foot in there again and I'm sure they are as glad as I am.",

    "text": "I went to the Mission this weekend for the first time in a couple months.  (My wife and I generally find ourselves there at least once a month--it's our favorite spot in town).  But since I hadn't been in a while, I forgot how great it is.  Ambiance: Couldn't get any better.  Candlelit and romantic.  Music is always hip--tends to get pretty loud on the weekends.   Service: We've had probably 5 or 6 different servers.  They are always friendly and full of knowledge about the menu, and great at making recommendations.   Food: Amazing.  I had the green chile duck this time.  One of my new favorites.  My wife always gets the peruvian stew and the black cod.  Perfect. (We never skip out on dessert.  The pumpkin bread pudding is to die for.)  Drinks: Eclectic wine selection--mostly stuff I don't know about, but we had south american pinot noir that was delicious.  Also, take a look at the tequila flights! (if you dare...) The margaritas are supposed to be the specialty here...Love the blood orange and their \"skinny\".  Did NOT love the ginger and spice one...  Experience: My only issue is that the meal tends to be distracting, as the tables are quite close together, and there is ALWAYS hustle and bustle in this place, so I wouldn't necessarily use it for important nights (i.e. proposals or something).  But for a night out on the town, and to see some of Scottsdale's prettiest people, I wouldn't miss it.",

My good friend held my baby shower at The Mission and it was just amazing. High class all the way. First off I just loved the decor, it was elegant and fun at the same time. The illuminated salt bricks were very cool and I just liked the trendy feel of the place.  Brian, the owner, went above and beyond to make sure that we got the \"back room\" for my shower so we could have privacy. They even printed up our own menu's specifically for us. We had our own wait staff who was very prompt and helpful. We felt very important the whole time we were there.  Even though I couldn't partake in the mimosa bar we had set up, my friends all said it was wonderful, as well as the mojitos...I'll have to go back to partake :)  For my breakfast, I ordered Chilaquiles, which was fried corn tortillas topped with red chile pork, fried egg and cotija cheese. They were delicious. I think there could have been a little more pork on them, but for the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed them. It was like breakfast nachos, and who doesn't like nachos. The other dish that looked unbelievable was the Cinnamon Pecan Waffles topped with cinnamon helado. Oh my goodness...if I could have eaten two dishes, I would have definitely ordered those as well! They just looked tempting. For dessert we had the Espresso churros. The churros were okay...a little too crispy, they would have been better if they were served warmer and  if they were softer. But the milkshake that came with it was great! Very creamy and just plain yummy.  I plan on going back when not pregnant so I can also try out the tequila bar! There are so many things on the menu I can't wait to try. Definitely had a great overall experience at the Mission!",

Upon entry, my date and I were cordially greeted by two very attentive hostesses who promptly showed us to our table after shuffling just a bit since we did not have reservations.  Our table was a bit tight, as we were seated against the wall, but it made no difference as both of the two groups that were seated next to us throughout the nite were cordial and polite, not affecting our dining one bit.  Our entrees were spectacular, and the side order of grits was a stand-out.  The table side guacamole was smooth (and plentiful) and the service, outstanding - almost too outstanding, as I think I was asked if I was finished with my meal about 5 times before I actually was, however I'll take too attentive service over the opposite any day.  At the end of the night, too, the manager was going around pouring small shots of a very fine tequila, just to give the remaining diners a taste and talk about the New Year's tasting menu they'd be serving.  He was a joy to talk to, and his personality was genuine - something that isn't always the case here in the valley (or anywhere, for that matter).  Lastly, I love the positioning of both the bar as well as the tables in the entire restaurant.  It flows well, its comfortable, and I will absolutely be going back.",

In Scottsdale I normally have my guard up at upscale restaurants, but this place totally put me at ease.   I made reservations, which I would highly recommend since the dining area is surprisingly small. The decor is nice, a little on the dark side, but they have this cool wall around the kitchen of back-lit glass that provides just enough light.   The cocktail list looked good, but opted for the red sangria, which was pretty good.   For appetizers, we had the crispy cola pork belly. If you get nothing else, get this! The texture and flavors were amazing. We also had the duck empanada which was flaky and good, but the pork belly won hands down in the appetizer round.   The Chorizo Porchetta was really flavorful and the meat was so tender you could eat it with a spoon. The white bean puree was our favorite side. We also got the creamy grits, there was just something off about these I couldn't put my finger on. The were slightly sour and only a little spicy. I kept eating them thinking they would get better, nope.   The other thing we had were the scallops. The sauce was excellent and the scallops were cooked perfectly. The serrano ham on the scallops was a bit too crispy, and crumbled like bacon when I tried to cut it, I was trying to get a bit in every bite.  For dessert, the churros and milkshake finished things off well. Not too much, just right.",

As others have stated before, perfect combination, spicy without compromising flavor.

The cucumber Jalapeno margorita is one of my favorite drinks around.  We always start with the guacamole (make sure you order it spicy, its really not that hot) and it never fails us. For entrees, my gf always gets the tecate steak tacos and they are fantastic. last time i had the pork shoulder tacos for two, and wow, were they flavorful. love the street corn here too.

    "text": "We dined at this restaurant a few weeks after it opened several years ago and found it lacking. We gave it the benefit of the doubt since it was new and needed to work out its problems. Deciding to return, we reserved a table for six at the restaurant through Open Table and arrive on time. We were asked to wait in a room the size of a coat closet next to the men and women's bathroom for forty minutes. While waiting we ordered drinks. The bar mixed a Martini dirty rather than dry with no attempt to correct the mistake. No complimentary chips or dips while waiting. Finally seated, a shoe leather tough steak fillet arrived after ordering it medium rare. An order of Mahi Mahi fish tacos was served as advertised battered instead of pan seared straying from the traditional.     The over used South American inspired menu is weak and should be reworked from the ground up. A theme past its prime. I will take a star away for poor management regarding the reservation screw-up since we are certain Open Table take their reservation application seriously. Take away another star for the uneven service and subtract a star for poor food preparation. One less star for general neglect. I will however give the restaurant one star for the lively bar scene which obviously keeps the doors open. With so many fine restaurants to choose in the Old Town area, why settle for this one?",

    "text": "I agree with the reviews about The Mission's great food.   It truly is a unique restaurant and almost everything you order will be delicious.   Leave room for the pumpkin bread pudding or their mango jalapeno Margarita!  Unfortunately the management is the worst I have ever experienced.  The last time I visited The Mission, we had a 9:00 PM reservation and didn't get seated until after 9:20.  Yes 20 minutes is not the worst thing in the world, but when your waitress offers a free round of drinks, takes your order, you get seated, and then she comes back to tell you that the drinks are no longer on the house... that is a little upsetting.  Oh and they still bring you all of the drinks, while the manager openly yells at the waitress (very professional). To ice the cake, we asked to speak with the manager and he didn't have the cojonas to come to our table. Instead he stood next to our table and watched us for an hour.  It was a very awkward dinner to say the least.  In my opinion, a fine restaurant with an exceptional chef should have quality management.  Until they fix the problem, I would not recommend The Mission.  If you are going to spend a pretty penny (which you most likely will), you deserve to be treated well and feel confortable while you eat.",

The guacamole everyone raved about \"made tabelside\" was made over in a corner and brought over to the table already made.  I would have liked to watch them make it.  Was just about one large scoop and that was it.  Left us wanting more, but flacor wasn't really there.  Underseasoned and overpriced at $12.00.  And the chips were undercooked so crunchy onthe outside, but tought toward the middle.  The chicken skewers with mole sauce was dry and mole was just ok.  The sweet potatoe/french fries were just like any other restaurants, but loved the sauces.  Tacos (ckicken) were just ok.   The much acclaimed pumpkin bread pudding was excellent, but only about a 3 inch square.  Just a teaser size.  I think if you don't mind spending the money, can get by the snooty waitress, and want to try something different, go for it.  Everyone in the area said to try Los Olivos right around the corner for really good Mexican food.",

We invited just over 50 people, and the patio was the perfect size, and that included having one the best chefs in PHX manning the grill, and putting out creative freshness on every plate.  The staff was nothing short of awesome, serving with a smile the entire night, and they seemed to be having just as much fun as we did.  We had a very special 3 days, and The Mission was right up there at the top bracket...just behind the ceremony next door.  Now stop reading these things and make a rezzie!",

When I brought it to the servers attention she gladly brought me back a reorder, but the reorder only had 1 egg versus 2.

    "text": "The tacos are small. There, I said it, I ordered the two most basic things on the menu, the other being the tableside guacamole. I just thought I'd get that out there up front.   When you walk up, it seems like it's part of or used to be a church. It actually isn't. You can tour The Mission next door... they were actually quite welcoming in there when I peeked in to get a glance. That's a review for a different day.   There are two outdoor seating areas here. One in the front and one it the back. We sat out back at a two top, umbrella-covered table. It seemed to be a very busy area, with staff members going back and worth to a kitchen or storage area. So, if you're looking for a more intimate atmosphere, don't sit in the outside seating out back.   The menu and Yelp featured photos remind me a tapa themed restaurant. The prices seemed a bit steep, but this was my first Scottsdale restaurant experience in years. $14 for tableside guacamole... yeah, I know it's fresh and made in front of you, but with only one avocado used, the portion size is smaller than what I've experienced with other tableside guacamole offered at elsewhere. Later during my stay this year, I learned that the avocados in Arizona do not taste as good as the ones in Kentucky. So, I wasn't impressed by the taste. As I mentioned, or warned you, I only added an order of three tacos, steak tacos to be exact. The steak was ok, but nothing other than the avocado really stood out within the tacos. And I'm not kidding, I think they were the smallest tacos that I've ever been served. Each about the length of my index finger. Definitely, don't assume that the photos of the tacos accurately depict the actual size.   Service was wonderful. Our waiter was fantastic and friendly.",

If you don't know what what a banana crab is, it's what 1950's scary movies were made of. They were the most dangerous things at my home around banana plants in Florida. They were the most scariest looking beasts I ever encountered during my childhood, and I never knew you could eat them. Now I want to eat my fears and that is the deadly Banana crab. I suggest you Google them just to take a look at what they look like and you'll say my God.  But back to the Mission. It has great ambience and a great vibe to it, as I thought it would be a rundown all restaurant that caters to tourists, au contraire Mont Freire.  I sat at the bar and the bar service was exceptional, but it was the food that really excited me everything looked amazing and every time I brought it up to the bartender he said hey dude everything here is excellent I can't recommend anything as it's all good. So it was a hard decision I got the pesola soup which was just out of this world and I got the short rib tacos, and they were Great but I felt as if I needed more but I was so full and I was so in love with the menu I didn't know what to do. The more I looked at the menu the more I wanted stuff, so I realized I would just have to go back and eat and eat and eat.  The chef here really has to be commended for creating such an interesting menu. I lived in Mexico for a year and I didn't even see anything close to what he had. It may have been the same food but his menu is written like a romance novel. It's what other restaurants need to copy when they develop their menu it is so beautifully written that you definitely want to order what you last read.",

The dishes are excellently prepared and the steaks cooked perfectly.  The flavors are defined and yet play well together.  Their menu is unique and always interesting.    The only reason for not giving them a 5 star review is it is much too dark in the inside dining room.  I kept having to use my cell phone to see.  Usually the server (in other high-end restaurants) would carry a light to help see the menu or to at least talk about particular dishes.  The whole \"I can't see my hand in front of my face\" is old school and it needs an update.  So if you can make it work, eat outside.  Either way, you won't be mad you ate here and your tastebuds will thank you!",

Some of my team members are visiting this week so naturally we came here for din! I had the Paloma for my first cocktail and it was SO tasty! I love that they put St. Germain in it! It came in a fancy frosted martini glass with a salted rim and was refreshing and delish.   To start - YOU MUST get the tableside guac because it is probably some of the best guac that i've ever had in my life. I also LOVE their chips - they're thin, crispy, and not oily at all. Paired with their homemade salsa, i'm a REAL happy camper. We also split the grilled little gem salad and this was pretty disappointing. There were no grill marks or char on it whatsoever but the flavors were good! It just wasn't what the menu advertised it to be.   For my entree, I got the Flat Iron Steak medium rare and added the poblano grits to it instead of the small cheesy rolls that it comes with and it was TO DIE FOR. The meat was cooked perfectly. I loved the tomatillos on it, and overall, it was just really flavorful. In my opinion they should serve it over grits all of the time! I enjoyed it with a glass of house cabernet and they paired perfectly together.   All in all, we had a great experience and I still stand firm behind my recommendation to colleagues and friends! :)   P.S. SO sorry for no photos - the restaurant is pretty dark and hard to take quality photos! My OCD just didn't even go there. ;)",

    "text": "Paid a visit to The Mission for a work dinner and walked into a vibey, candlelit Mexican restaurant which is so perfect for a first date. Why you ask? The lighting. Mostly because there is none. It was so dark that I squinted as I tried my best to read the menu. Am I old? Do I need reading glasses? Nope, it's just insanely dark in here. The good news is if you're a little worried about appearances, this is the perfect spot to get your heart's desire to fall in love with your personality! Is this a little vapid? Yes. But the dating scene is harsh, and that's why I'm married. I got tired of hiding in dimly lit restaurants.   You'll be happily greeted with crispy freshly made tortilla chips and salsa which are awesome! I basically ate my weight in chips which I do not regret one bit. Their table side guacamole was not my favorite, but I'm not the biggest avocado fan either so who cares what I think. We ordered the Mexican street corn in a bowl, but next time I'd prefer it on the cob. It just tastes different when you eat it that way, plus you have lots of corn stuck in your teeth which will make everyone feel awkward when you smile at them throughout the meal. Avoid the grilled gem salad. It was chopped up and covered in cheese. Definitely my least favorite dish of the night, mostly because it just wasn't what we expected. If you liked this dish, and we were the last man and woman left on Earth, the human race would die because I would refuse to procreate with you. That's how serious I am when it comes to salad. End of civilization serious.  But on a very serious note, their pork tacos are amazing! You have to order them to feed two people, so if your first date isn't into this, you'll automatically know you should walk away. If they can't agree to collaborate on sharing ten tortillas and a delectable pork shoulder taco feast, how can you possibly expect them to compromise on taxes, kids and doing the dishes. And if they don't want to sprinkle cilantro on top, run as quickly as you can. Everyone knows that people who don't like cilantro are total weirdos and not to be trusted.",

This is a \"modern Latin American\" restaurant (read: Spanish, Mexican, Peruvian, etc. fusion). That means they do portions tapas style, perfect for the adventurous (or those who have to try everything on the menu, like me!)  I tried three things on the menu - the barbacoa tacos (I practically inhaled them), the pork belly pibil (MUST order. I wish I ate this before the tacos to be able to savor it more). This put me at a pretty stuffed state, but I couldn't leave without dessert. I chose the espresso churros and they were so good. The churros are super light and airy, and it comes with a chocolate milkshake for you to dip them in!   Side note, the ambiance is great as well. I wasn't able to enjoy it very much alone, especially since the pictures were so hard to take... but great for a date night!",

I've had lots of guacamole over the years. Some of it good. Some of it absolute crap, but the tableside guacamole prepared at the mission by far outstrips anything else I've ever had. They can do a variety of recipes for you seasoned to taste (and trust me... I I like it HOT... And they are the only place I've ever found that can adequately accomplish that task). Although the mission does have many other wonderful qualities to add to this recommendation, as far as I'm concerned I've already said as much as you need to know.",

I understand they're trying to be trendy with the club music etc but literally as the hostess is walking you to the table, you're unsure if you're going to trip on something.   Started with the pork belly pibil and duck carnitas empanadas. Apps took a tremendously long time to come out. The proteins within each dish were cooked well but the concept was lost on me. Empanadas were cut into quarters with sauce poured all over it. Empanadas are meant to be handheld foods, but now with sauce all over it? Pork belly was cooked well but should have been served with a sharper knife than a butter knife.   Our main course was the pork shoulder tacos. Again, protein was good but lacked in some accompanying ingredients. Served the pork shoulder with tortillas, onions, cheese and cilantro.   Overall was very disappointed given the rave reviews. Friendly, but very slow service. And average food.",

It's located in Old Town, in a wing of Scottsdales oldest Adobe church.  Inside, it's dark, rustic, and twinkling with ornate crystal chandeliers.   At the bar,  I had a Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita with a salty rim, which I easily had a second with dinner.  Our large group was sat on the back patio, but we hardly knew it.  The vibe carried seamlessly to the outdoors, with heatlamps, foliage and candlelight.   Best thing? The complimentary tortilla chips and spicy salsa which they kept on coming.  We also had the Tableside Guacamole, which as the name suggests, was made in front of us with lots of fresh ingredients.  It was amazing!   There were a dozen things on the menu I could have eaten.  The Mole Duck Confit tacos were tasty,  bthe Short Rib Barbacoa tacos were my fave.  No room for desert after all those chips, but I'll save room next time, because I'll be back.",

    "text": "Dear Tourists, Beware, this is \"not\" I repeat, \"not\" what real Mexican food tastes like or costs!  I have lived here all my life, and honestly say this place is nothing other than a tourist trap. The restaurant is so dimly lit you have to use your phones flashlight app to read the menu. The noise level is so loud, we could hardly hear the waitress. Let's start with the table side guacamole. These are not Haas avocados and whoever came up with adding pepitas is out of their mind. The texture was grainy and so unpleasant. $14.00 is ridiculous. Next, let's visit their pork shoulder tacos. If you want your tacos to taste like sweet bbq, these are for you. Not even close to being Mexican in flavor. $34.00 enough for two. Our last visit is with their Mahi Mahi tacos. When they set down the plate, I almost laughed out loud, but, had a guest from out of town, so I refrained. There on my plate were 3 of the tiniest tacos I have ever seen! The size of the tortilla was no more than 3\" in diameter, each with a 2\" piece of fish! And this huge plate was $14.00! This is the first place in a long time that I have left totally disappointed and hungry!  If you truly want to eat real Mexican food, try Abuellos Mexican Embassy. It will knock your socks off with how good real Mexican food can be.  Never again will I fall for \"Old Town\" restaurants as being good.",

What we had ~ chunky guacamole ~ seasoned and prepared perfectly, bone in rib eye ~ which was probably in the top 10 best steaks ive ever had and I've had quite a few, and the pork shoulder which was so tender and flavorful due to the mesquite, and a side of the roasted corn with squash, zucchini and mushrooms. I'm definitely going back on my next visit to Scottsdale!",

Ordered salmon - received swordfish Ordered sweet potato fries - received regular fries and was told later they were out of the sweet potato fries. Isn't that something the waiter should have known?  Ordered Mole Duck Confit tacos - they were about what you'd expect from a food truck.  I was charged for an entree I didn't order and had to have it taken off my check....same as the people at the table next to me. Very suspicious.

On Sundays (not sure if all day) they have a taco station where you can make yourself unlimited tacos for $17 per person. We also ordered their guacamole as recommended by our server which was so fresh and tasted so good; they make it right it front of you!

I am so glad I found this restaurant.  \"The Mission\" is next door to The Mission -- that is, the original Spanish Mission from 1905 or so in Scottsdale.  They are not related as far as ownership, but share a similar style.  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  Dim chandeliers, and lights hidden behind warm quartz rock and crystals, and gothic decorations, lots of mirrors, crosses, and an angel in the middle of the restaurant.  The servers here are all very friendly and positive.  We had a reservation for the wrong date, but they were able to accommodate us even though we had it wrong.   The bar is lively, as is the rest of the restaurant.  Lots of couples on dates, men discussing business, and groups of girls doing a \"girls night out\", all dressed up.   The food was fantastic.  The small tacos were perfect portion sizes, and the kale salad was spicy and unique and delicious.  The drinks were all great.  Cannot recommend this restaurant enough.

    "text": "From the outside, this restaurant is beautiful. The patio is cozy & intimate. The inside is chic with authentic decor and fancy chandeliers. Unfortunately, the substance of the restaurant (food & drinks) fell flat.   We sat on the patio for a late lunch so some of the items suggested by fellow Yelpers were not available on that menu. The restaurant was not very busy during this time so our service was quick and attentive. Here's the lowdown on what we ordered:  - Table-side guacamole: obviously b/c it was recommended by everyone here! The portion was just enough for 2 people but not outstanding at all. In fact, it was very bland (even with all the ingredients added to it). For $12, I expected much more. - Short Rib Barbacoa Taco: topped with a massive slice of pickle on top, I wasn't sure if this was for presentation or they were too lazy to cut it into smaller pieces for easier handling. At least the pickle gave it some bite, which is more than I can say for the other Taco. - Skirt Steak Taco: the steak was chewy and the taco as a whole was very bland. I had to dip it in the salsa that came with the guacamole to add taste to it. I wouldn't recommend ordering this on a date b/c you'll be too busy trying to chew the steak to talk. - Drinks: Papaya blended margarita. They usually have 2 rotating flavors a day for frozen ones and she brought both out in a sample glass for me to try!  Overall, the experience here did not stand out and I found it to be quite pricey for what we got. Not only was the food mediocre but the portions were tiny. Perhaps the tacos should be recommended as an appetizer instead? Our food also came out almost immediately, which made me question how fresh prepared this place really is. Based on my skirt steak, I wonder if it was just sitting out on the counter all day.   I was hoping to experience some outstanding, authentic Mexican food here but unfortunately I can recommend better ones in Vancouver!",

    "text": "During a recent trip to Scottsdale, a few friends and I tried to make last second reservations here. Of course they had nothing available since we tried to reserve it at the last minute.  So we rolled the dice and just headed over to see if could wait it out.  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table.  Not bad overall.    We started with the chips, salsa, and guacamole.  Their guacamole is absolutely delicious.  Not cheap though.  And they prepare it right at your table so you can determine what goes in, and how spicy you want it.  One friend and I shared the pork shoulder with flour tortillas.  It was delicious.  I also ordered a mojito which was also very good.  We sat out on the patio and it was a beautiful night so it was perfect.  Service was also very good.  Food is a little pricey for what it is, but in the end you get what you pay for.  Overall a very good experience.",

Matt Carter, the head chef has created a menu for foodies, and yet the dishes are not overthought, and portions are a good size. If you like corn soup you MUST get the Almejas al Vapor soup. Omg, it is to die for! The combination of flavors works so perfectly on the palette. I am definitely going back to try the scallops, and basically work my way up and down the menu. The cucumber jalapeno margarita is my fave, has just the right amount of kick, and isn't overly sweet. Once again, it is so perfectly balanced. Make reservations on a weekend night, this place packs up quickly!",

We've been to taco stands in Cali & Philly that was way better. Presentation, atmosphere, the Guac and sever was on top.... so for that I give 3 stars. However I've been to plenty of higher end restaurants with better tasting food that I didn't mind pinching pennies for. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but I don't think I'd come back.",

Firstly, the hostesses were gracious in letting us know that the hood in the kitchen was being repaired, but that some food and drinks were available. Respectful and appropriate expectation setting. Next was a fabulous server, conscientious and accommodating of a large party with 3 very small children. Management was extremely helpful and honest when it came to letting us know that repairs were going to be a while and when that wasn't an option for us (hungry kids=cranky kids) not only did they get us a reservation at their sister restaurant, they comped our meal and arranged transportation!   The food, drinks and ambience at the Mission are always top notch, but the professional and kind service tonight was over the top. You have loyal customers and brand advocates for life! Well done and expect to see us again soon!",

    "text": "We came for brunch on Sunday and being it was our first time we made reservations. They were probably not needed at 11am, but it did get a little busier as morning turned to afternoon. We asked to be seated on the patio and the hostess seemed somewhat confused. When she took us outside she tried to seat us right next to the only other table on the patio. We said we would prefer to sit on the other, empty side. The next couple that came in was seated right next to us!  The menu looked good, but the brunch section only had about 5 items, not much of a choice. The server was friendly and recommended the huevos rancheros, she asked if we wanted meat, my girlfriend said no as she is a vegetarian. When it came it had pork, but the food runner was quick to correct it.  I asked for her recommendation between the red or green chilaquilles and she wholeheartedly said green. Seeing that the green had cilantro and the red didn't , I went green - they were good, but the green was chicken and the red was pork and everyone raves about the pork here, maybe I should have got the red.  The talk of the town here is \"try the guacamole\" and while it wasn't bad, making it tableside wasn't much of a show and one avocado certainly wasn't worth $12. The awkwardness started when the guacamole was finished and plopped on the table, but the chips didn't arrive until a good 5 minutes later. Wasn't sure if I should be eating it with a spoon or not.  Mimosas and bloody marys were half off, which was nice, but when I ordered a second one it didn't arrive until well after I was finished eating and then only after a reminder.  Maybe it was because we came so soon after they opened and maybe everyone was still hungover from Saturday night, but the hostess, server and cook just weren't on their A game today.",

Too many flavors going on, no cohesion. We also ordered the skirt steak tacos. The handmade tortillas were quite good, but the steak tasted smokey, almost like bacon. Nothing like I thought or was described.   Our waitress seemed like she just started working there. Whenever we asked her questions, she answered awkwardly with hesitation. At the end of our meal, she didn't ask us if we liked the food. I'm surprised that she is working in fine dining. Seems like she would be better fit at a sports bar.  Maybe I am spoiled from living in Portland, but, overall, I would not recommend this place.",

They do an all you can eat street tacos with pork on Sunday as well.... we opted for the recommended Chaquiles with pork (in the red sauce) and it was incredible!

He was totally on point with all his recommendations and knew exactly when we would want our next course. We started off with the table-side guacamole that was by far the best guac you could possibly ever have. In addition to that Jammar also recommended street corn dip which really balanced the heat of our guacamole. For dinner we had the pork shoulder tacos which were melt in you mouth good. Finally, for desert Jammar brought us their pumpkin bread pudding. Best dessert I've had in awhile.  It was truly an incredible dinning experience.",

We had the mahi, sweet potato, and pork shoulder tacos and the were each extremely unique and delectable. I loooooved the green/verde salsa they served on the side and the two different reds were amazing as well. The waitress suggested the corn and grits as sides and I was somewhat annoyed by her persistence to have us order more more more, but I'm happy we listened! Grits seem to be MIA in most breakfast spots in AZ (east coast I never have a problem finding it) so I was surprised to see it on a dinner menu..and excited to know they were chipotle spiced grits... no words.. so good.  The corn was mouth watering and I realllllly hope it wasn't just soaked in butter, but they tasted awfully creamy-yum yum yummm! We got the expresso soaked churros for dessert and I wasn't in love with them-they weren't overly flavorful and looked kind of sad. However, the fried bananas were to die for and came with a peanut butter mousse that made me catch my breath... :):) Back Patio was nice except we were seated next to a huge fan.... bleh. kind of an ambience killer, but the food made up for it.",

We started with table side guacamole.  My wife ordered a duck confit, and I had a chorizo pork shoulder. Both were good, but we both felt stuffed before we could finish the entrees. Too Rich or too many chips?   Either way, we felt like humpy dumpty.   I asked my wife to order dessert, because the yelp reviews were amazing. Pumpkin bread pudding and chocolate churro were wasted (we left more than we ate). Now, we were not enjoying the experience. Overbearing noise, Rich food, and flavors all felt the same. Sorry Mission, I can eat...but you failed in making me want to.    I know others will disagree, as this place did not lack business.",

I was working in Mesa and my girlfriend somewhere in Phoenix and we thought Scottsdale would be our halfway point.  When we exchange restaurant ideas this place won just from food choices, presentation and of course the look. It was everything. We started off with drinks at the bar -pineapple ginger mojito-  Low and behold we were seated in the back patio, the best spot in the house!!! The waiter Andres was amazing, we ordered table side guacamole which I am only a fan of when made fresh, it was delish!  I always try to order something new, when I first visit a restaurant so I stayed away from my regular choice of fish and chose the Jidori Chicken with a substitute of vert over the cheesy rice.  OMG!! It was a perfectly filling light meal and exquisitely delicious meal with a light kick of spicy flavor on the vert.  What I love is a restaurant that is conscious of serving up fresh, healthy and appropriate sized portions. To top it off, the manager stopped by to check-in with our food and service satisfaction...so classy! My only regret: I didn't cheat my meal plan for the day and order dessert...haha That pumpkin bread pudding would have been my choice.  Next time for sure!",

Here are a few of my favorite menu items: pork shoulder tacos served on the salt block, street corn, table-side guacamole, cola lime pork appetizer, mahi mahi tacos and espresso churros.  Whenever dine here, I always order a few things for the table and then we all share.  I find it best to order that way so that we can all try a few items on the menu since there are so many delicious options to choose from.  The mission also has great margaritas.",

    "text": "This was a wonderful experience.  We ordered the table side Guacamole as an appetizer and it was excellent!  Tons of different ingredients that went together exceptionally well!  Afterwords, i order the prime skirt stake and my wife orders the chicken.  Our expectation was that you would add some salsa and guacamole on a flour tortilla and treat it like a fajita.  WRONG.  Oh no, the steak and chicken with their seasoning stand alone.  They were exceptional.  It would have been a huge mistake to turn it into a standard Mexican tourist fajita.    Finally, I have to say great things about our waiter, my receipt says his name is Gregg. We arrived late afternoon and before the formal dinner menu starts, so we had the guacamole appetizer.   Greg had said he was working the morning shift and off at 5:00.  When 5 rolled around, we were ready to order dinner and asked Gregg if he was going to leave.  He said absolutely not, he was here to wait on us till we left.  No pressure, great service.  We were really impressed.  Great food, great service, you can't ask for better.",

I am not a Latino/Mexican foody but the scallops, black cod, white bean puree, green beans (forget the mexican term on the menu), and the fried banana were amazing.....we opted to not indulge in the plethora of tequilas on the menu but it was VERY tempting....Ill be back and probably very soon!

It was so dark inside that I had to use my phone to read the menu, but then the very nice server brought us some little flashlights to use. They were out of many of dishes, like anything that had short ribs in it, etc (it was after the holidays). The server was incredibly helpful and answered any questions we had and sought out answers when she didn't know. We nearly closed the place down, but they didn't seem to rush us. The food was great, but we were expecting it to be exceptional after reading all the reviews and being recommended by our hotel concierge. We ordered the tabletop guacamole at the recommendations of fellow Yelpers. It was good, but felt it did not live up to the hype. Everyone was pleased with their dishes. Overall, a great dining experience, with a few kinks. I would try it again if I ever make it back into town.",

This very upscale Mexican Cuisine was simply awesome.   The quality of the food and the ambiance makes this a must for anyone who has not had the pleasure of this exquisite dining experience. The staff is young , hip and super friendly, they make sure that your meal is perfect.   My wife and I stopped by for lunch before we had to head back to the airport, we couldn't decide between the skirt steak or Mahi Mahi taco's so we ordered them both! The marinade on the skirt steak was perfect it melted in your mouth, the Mahi Mahi was breaded just right and cooked to perfection with a nice compliment of crunchy cabbage citrus escabeche and a olive crema on top.   All I can say is next time were in town were coming definitely coming back to try some of the other dishes. We didn't get a chance to have drinks, but their selection of hand pressed cocktails looked very enticing as well.   You won't be disappointed for sure!",

    "text": "I decided to check this place out after many of the people I had recommended it to came back raving about it! They were right!   The Mission is located in Old Town Scottsdale amidst a flurry of Arizona souvenir shops,  pricey art galleries and historical museums.  This is a very touristy area.  Despite that, the Mission is anything but touristy.  It is tastefully decorated as the name would imply, and still goes a step beyond the cliche mission style with romantic window treatments and elegant chandalier lighting.  My friend and I came in for lunch and as we past  through the front patio, debated whether or not to dine al fresco.  That though evaporated as soon as we entered and eyed the bar.  It called out to us- as many bars do.  Unlike the rest of the place, the bar was empty so we hunkered down and recieved incredibly friendly and professional service. After chatting up the bartender a little about the menu, we sipped our LA Vodka and sodas.  The vodka was tinged with pommegranite and was a little to sweet for me but it was vodka. The tableside Guacamole was prepared with excellent results. Chunky, creamy and best of all zesty as it should be.  The Chips were warm and had 3 different salsas for dipping.  One was smokey, one green and one was just right! Next up was a Peruvian clam stew, served with Taro root bread to sop up the savory juices.  The clams were fresh and the vegetables were very flavorful.  Delishious! We decided to split the Pork Shoulder tacos.  Even though they appeared to be small, the flavor they packed was anything but.  It was the perfect amount  for us.  After a second drink and several glasses of water, we though t we were through- but no. Our bartender friend surprised us with yet  another incredibly tasty dish- Pumpkin bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and a little carmel sauce.  It was worth every fat calorie! Everything about this place was excellent.  The service was impeccable.  The decor- interesting and romantic.  The food was truly inspiring and satisfying on every level.   I can't wait to go back for Brunch!!!!",

    "text": "This high end Latin-American food restaurant was actually a last minute decision. I use to play in a youth orchestra that was hosted just next door in the old mission and didn't know this was now a restaurant. The ambiance is dim and romantic. Definitely has a Spanish feel. The patio is amazing, especially on a clear, starry, warm night. The patio is cozy with a large brick fireplace, comfortable chairs, and a secluded location a midst downtown Scottsdale. The menu is to die for! So many unique foods: Peruvian clam stew, swordfish, octopus, etc. My friend and I each got a drink- the capirinhia was ok. Nothing special. The cheese place was very tasty and had a lot of variety of flavors to mix, but there wasn't much to eat. My friend got the swordfish entree. Mmm! Very hearty fish with 2 sides. The flavoring and seasoning is what made the dish. I got the Creekside filet *the most expensive dish on the menu*. SO worth it! The filey mignon was cooked rare (though I asked for medium), but again the spices and seasoning were so unique and savory, I took my time enjoying each bite! It came with a side of white bean grits (also very tasty, but filling). If you want a great night out with a group or a romantic dinner for 2, go here. By the way, I believe his name is Johnathan, but he's a great server and honest about the menu selections.",

    "text": "I have been here to eat twice and while the first experience was ok the second time has me writing of the place for good. I will say the service was always speedy and quick both times but when we went to brunch the menu has better options like the chiliquiles.   My problem is the limited menu during lunch time and the quality of that food. The table side guac was ok and some could say great if they prefer it one way more than another. I would say it wasn't close to Salty's but not terrible like America's taco shop on 7th st. There menu consist of two basic options excluding the soup during lunch, tacos and tortas. Their tortas remind me more of something you would find at a wildflower except without any good mixture of ingredients. you would think that if you only served 5 different things you would be really good. I don't mind a small amount of choices, even if you think of your own home rotation of meals you cook for your family you could limit it to your top 5 things and have a menu that would kick the crap out of most restaurant menus I am sure. I had the brisket torta which seemed to be a mix of a lox and a thin(super thin) layer of burnt beef. My girlfriend thought the same. My friend had another one that looked better but she said she wouldn't rush to come back for it. The side of beans were ok and the chorizo and potatoes were ok more for the potato side as the chorizo was semi bland and couldn't hold a candle to any Shreiner's offering.  So we had a 90$ lunch (no alcohol) that had faux latin food. When I went to brunch my girl did like the drinks and the chiliquiles are good but you could do better from any torta chain with little effort and just suffer from the ambiance for better food. Guero's tortas comes to mind but like I said even Subway could own these guys.",

I have to say I was impressed with the quality...and a restaurant that makes my very food-closeted friend try something new (pork belly), gets some stars from me.  The pork belly was amazing, just like I used to eat growing up, crunchy and fatty.  The mahi mahi tacos were pretty good, but I mostly liked the sauce cause the fish was just a piece of fried fish.  The tortillas were the size of a silver dollar...I'm just warning those expecting huge tacos here. For dessert we had the churros...not my favorite since they deviated from the normal fried dough to a chocolate one, and served it with some espresso milkshake that was incredibly creamy.  Still wondering if they add condensed milk or something like that.  The ambiance in the patio was pretty nice, quiet enough, nice weather.   But I still found this place overpriced.  Went out to dinner twice in a weekend to Scottsdale, and both times I was horrified by the prices.  I guess I'm paying for the ambiance and trendiness.  I would recommend this place to people but warning them to go get their drinks somewhere else since they are not special, but they charge you special prices (wink, wink).",

He gave us samples of his signature margaritas and we loved the flavors - and we're not froufrou margarita lovers. I love the blood orange marg! The margaritas alone are worth a trip to the Mission.   The front patio was very inviting and cozy with a fireplace as the centerpiece. Perfect for a balmy Arizona fall evening.   Yes, the food portions seem small, but the flavors are so full & rich that we were all full afterward. Salsa, freshly made guacamole, clam stew, skirt steak & chicken tacos, and pork belly fajitas were all amazing. The \"medium\" guacamole was a bit mild for my taste but very tasty.   All in all it was a party for the taste buds!   Service - it was a very busy Saturday night and they were packed, but they got us a table on the patio without a reservation within about 10 minutes. Our server was attentive and informative but not intrusive or over friendly. We were quite happy with the service.   Prices - perhaps they are high, but for the quality and inventive flavors the prices are in line. This is not your neighborhood Mexican restaurant after all. For 5 of us with appetizer, meals and multiple generous drinks the total was $140. Not bad for a unique evening!  Parking - there's a huge lot just across the street and another parking garage right behind the restaurant.  It's certainly not a problem to walk a block, especially on a relaxing fall evening.",

Some dishes you must try are the duck empanadas , guacamole, and crispy cola pork to start. The hearts of palm salad is delicious but the pork tacos are absolutely amazing and a big must.

We both ordered tacos and while they were beautifully presented, neither of us were blown away by the flavors.  The portions were smallish and not very hearty. I thought mine could have used more spice and salsa, and I almost never say that.  This restaurant errs on the side of fancy Mexican food and seems more for a nice dinner or night out but definitely not for lunch.",

They have a really cool pork taco bar on Sundays with all you can eat tacos for only $14! The chips and salsa were also really good. We had a pretty big group and a couple people helping us and the entire staff was super friendly!",

    "text": "This was our \"splurge\" dinner while on vacation over the holidays.  We picked The Mission after visiting the sister restaurant (House Brasserie) on the Scottsdale food tour earlier in the week.  The restaurant is beautiful, but the seating is a bit tight.  We enjoyed talking to the couple seated next to us, however, if you're looking for a more private dining experience this might not be the place for you.   We started with the guacamole, prepared table side.  It was okay but the salsa was actually much better.  Dinner choices include typical meat/seafood entree dishes or tacos (3 small tacos).  My husband had the Malbec braised short ribs.  It was a very generous portion of meat served on a very minimal portion of a vegetable.  The menu indicated they were \"crispy potatoes\" but they looked and tasted more like a plantain. The tacos I ordered came as described - three small steak tacos.   As a side dish we had a ridiculously large order of mixed regular and sweet potato fries with two dipping sauces.  We ate less than 1/3 of them, in part because there were just too many and also because they were not as tasty as the rest of the food.    I can't comment on the drinks, but the menu looked interesting.  The service was great.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful.  Our water and ice tea glasses were filled constantly.  Because of the proximity of tables I could not help but overhear the party next to us and their constant questions and demands of our server.  She handled them all politely and as patiently as she possibly could.    Overall, I think this is a very solid choice and we would return to try some other dishes.  The service is outstanding",

I realize now why the website doesn't list prices-- the mission is hideously overpriced!  We ended up on the patio since they weren't seating in the main area yet (at 6:30pm? For reals?) Our waitress was nice and attentive. She noticed my water had something floating in it and replaced it quickly. My husband's water glass was dirty too. She brought us out two sample size frozen peach and strawberry margaritas which were awesome. Much better than the rocks margarita.  No complimentary chips and salsa which would be ok if they offered something else like Barrio. No happy hour either which was disappointing.  The street corn was good, but I've had much better. The butternut squash tacos were out of this world. My husband liked them better than his mahi tacos. I just can't believe they have the gall to charge $12 for 3 tiny (3 inches in diameter) tacos. They also charge $12 for guac made from 2 avocados. I'm not sure how they have survived in this economy. They must be very slow when the tourists leave for the summer.",

The Guacamole had too much lime. The first Kale salad we sent back, way too salty. It was the dressing, way to salty. Not sure why this French trained chef needed to use so much salt in dressing. Next salad was better.   My fish was delicious as was the duck.   When we were asked twice how things were, we answered the second time with, Many folks are using phones and flashlights to see, maybe you need some lights over here! I presume it was the Manager who didn't even listen to what we said and went to speak with the waitress. He seemed pretty Arrogant. He should lose the attitude because dinner this evening was very disappointing.  Presentation is very important for customers. With no lights, we couldn't see the presentation or what we were eating.",

The guy who cleared the tables was just bad, though.  He took plates too early without asking if they were done, and managed to spill a heavy mole sauce on us.  The food was great, but since the service was terrible, I will stay away from here.",

Elisha, in addition to being the cutest little thing ever, was knowledgeable and knew when to check in and offer suggestions.  We got the Elderflower Paloma cocktail and the Ginger Cilantro drink both delicious and not overpowering.  Food wise we split appetizers which was perfect for a night of drinking.  Not too much but also not too little so that we were drunk stumbling around looking for a taco truck at 2 am.    We ordered the crisp pork belly placed artistically on little gem lettuce cups.  They had a coca cola glaze and were crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside.  We also got the chicken empanada a delightful and flavorful burst of tastiness on a crisp handcooked shell.  Also a highlight was the tableside guacamole.  The busboy brings over a cart and mixes all the magic at the table and asks what your preference is from mild to hot.  He created a zesty and spicy but not overpowering medium to hot guac that made our chips disappear in no time!  Simple things like management presence and the constant refill of my water glass made me appreciate the well oiled machine that is The Mission.  The ambiance is old meets new (of course it's in an old mission) with dimly lit candles and modern southwestern decor that makes it ideal for a date, casual dinner, drinks at the bar, or small gathering.  I would definitely go back next time I am in Scottsdale!  Prices aren't cheap but are well worth a great meal with great service.",

The ambiance is very nostalgic and it actually feels like your are in a mission. The first thing we ordered was the guacamole because it had been raved about on Yelp. It definitely lived up to the hype. It is prepared table side and you can decide what you want in it and how hot you want it to be. The next things we ordered were the Crispy Pork and Cola Lime Glaze and the Grilled Street Corn off the cob. They both were amazing and I couldn't see how the meal could get any better. For our entrees, we decided to get the Malbec Braised Shortrib and the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos. Both were unreal. The Shortrib was soft and fell apart so easily but remained juicy and tender. It was served with a smear of queso fresco and fingerling potatoes. The tacos were delicious and surprisingly filling given their size. I could taste how fresh the tortilla was and the steak was grilled perfectly. We also had another order of the Grilled Street Corn because it was too good to only have once. To top the meal off, we got the Espresso Churros and Pumpkin Bread Pudding. The Churros were served with a milkshake and the bread pudding was served with a scope of vanilla ice cream. Both were scrumptious and ended the meal perfectly. The experience was terrific and the service was on point. Our server knew the menu from front to back and helped us decide on all of our delicious dishes. Even the bus boys were friendly and polite. I now have a new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale and see why it was so hard to get a reservation all this time.",

It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.  When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru.   The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.  My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.",

Of course, being from California where this is outlawed I HAD to have some foie gras! This appetizer was amazing! I could have had seconds but who wants to be a little piggy? Not me!  Especially when their specialty is pork!   Mmmm pork. Where do I start? I had the chorizo porchetta & my SO had the pork shoulder tacos. Both were melt in your mouth amazing. I finished off my entree & wanted to lick the plate clean!   Having heard they are known for their Avocado Margaritas, I was intrigued. You may think WHAT? AVOCADO MARGARITA!??! Rest assured you MUST try one! They are very yummy... You can't taste the avo. It makes it creamy & a uniquely green goodness.   The service was really really good. Our server was attentive & keen on making sure our drinks & food were served promptly. It was a fine dining experience that didn't feel pretentious. It felt casual and comfortable; the way I like my experience to be.   I can assure you I will be returning to The Mission the next time I visit Scottsdale. Until then, I'll go back to dreaming about avocado margaritas.",

I had the Green Chile Duck for my entree and it was one of the best plates of food I've had in a while. It had a sweet, salty, spicy thing going on and was really well balanced.   The service, while quite friendly, was inexcusably slow. We waited way too long between courses and what should have taken an hour and a half at most, took close to 3.

    "text": "We have been to the Mission before and had very good food, sadly last evening this was not the case.  My husbands Flat Iron steak was very good, my Chicken Anticuchos was not.  The chicken was very, very dry and barely able to cut through it with the knife I was given.  I had to saw through it and pull it apart with the knife and fork to get small enough pieces to eat. The flavor was OK and the rice mole and mushrooms were good.  It is unfortunate that most restaurants in Scottsdale do not know how to cook chicken so that it is moist and tender.  I see many reviews that say \"under $30 dollars\"  I don't know what menu they are looking at but $30. dollars is the starting price of any dish and it goes way up from there!  As I said, the first time we were here the food was very good but that was a couple years ago, it seems to have changed.",

It was absolutely spot on in every single way - service (wait staff and busboys and hostesses), food (so many new nuances for my tastebuds to enjoy), price (not as expensive as I would have thought, but then again it was my Birthday, so I didn't exactly pay attention to the total bill tally), and atmosphere (trendy with a twist of old school flare). Looking forward to their new location opening soon in Kierland (North Scottsdale). I hope that they can transplant everything that I loved about the original to their new location for another amazing restaurant choice for dinners and drinks!!!",

The tableside guacamole was good, not great.. lacked seasoning and definitely  not enough portion for a table of four... wish they would have suggested a double portion??   We all had the taco platters.. one chicken two steak, one pork... The pork  was definitely the best! Snack portions... So order extra appetizers, or plan on dessert.  The street side fired corn was amazing... Off the cob.  The cucumber jalapeno margarita was amazing -wish they had put a lot less ice in it however... Two sips and it was gone.  Definitely overpriced... Prices high, portions low... But I'd say the atmosphere makes that easier to handle.",

    "text": "Found this on Yelp when we stayed at Phoenician.  Right in Old Scottsdale.  We called after arriving and only open tables at 7 pm were on patio.  Fortunately its both covered and has two huge fans to keep things cooler (105 when we arrived for reservation!).  It was comfortable despite the heat outside. Place was packed.  Very dark and loud inside so we enjoyed being outside.  Shortly after being seated 5 others parties arrived and the waiter got slammed.  Good waiter, generally stayed ahead of the crush with some assistance from other staff.  Definitely a hip joint and crowd. Whatever other apps you might get order the table side guacamole! Great presentation and they will make it to suit your tolerance for spice. Not sure if chips are homemade but lighter than chips we had at other Mexican influenced restaurants in northern and mid state Arizona  Salsa has a good kick but not as veggie as other places I tried in Arizona. Two in our party had Beef & chicken tacos.  On the smaller side.  Another had the Chorizo Puchetta, which she liked.  I had Marinated Kiritimati chicken.  Served in spicy sauce and quite good.  Extensive drink menu.   Would recommend this place but call a day in advance or early the day of if you want to sit inside.",

Only positive was the waitress and the man who made the guacamole. They were very nice but had to apologize for the darkness and the various menu items not available due to time of day when there was a shift change. Whatever. I would suggest putting together a clear concise menu, turn up the lights and maintain an open entry to the hostess stand.  From what I did see it looks like a cute place and has potential.",

We each ordered tacos - the butternut squash and the Brussel sprouts one. Both very good. For dessert, I had the fried bananas. They were good but a little too much pastry vs banana. I would give it 5 stars for the food, but I knocked it down to 4 because of the darkness of the restaurant. It was way too dark to the point we had to use the flashlight on our phones to read the menu and to even see our food! You could tell everyone was struggling to see.

    "text": "When we first arrived I thought our server was going to be snobby - the music was blasting inside and the restaurant seemed to be filled with only 20-somethings, so we decided to sit outside even though it was butt-cold.  To my surprise our waitress was very cool and made accommodations for us like moving the heater over to our table, offering to split our dish (we shared a main and ordered several other appetizers) and offering us hot water after we pulled this next thing off...    Because I can't drink freaking ice water when it's 30 degrees out, I asked for a cup of hot water to warm up the ice water we'd been given.  Then I realized I had a bag of tea in my purse and put it in the hot water.  When our waitress came out she look shocked and said, \"did you bring your own tea?\"  Well, I hadn't planned on sneaking in tea to the restaurant it just happened to be in my purse from another event we went to before dinner and it seemed like a good idea when she brought me the hot water.  When I explained that we'd just been to the Botanic Garden's annual Holiday Luminaria event and the tea was from that, she asked if we wanted more hot water.  How cool is that?  We act like near vagabonds at the restaurant and we still get the royal treatment.  That's good service.  Oh.  You probably want to know about the food.  BEST GUACAMOLE I've ever had.  Ever.  Really.  Made table side, to order, leave out whatever you want.  Freaking amazing.  The homemade salsa also rocked the house.  I asked if there was cilantro in it (because I can't have it) and our waitress asked and returned with an answer - no.  Just good, good service even though this joint seems almost like a nightclub after 8pm.  Our dinner was tastefully made and delicious.  We almost went back to do two nights in a row and honestly, after eating at Frank & Albert's instead, I pretty much wish we had eaten at The Mission two nights in a row.  Superb.",

We all were quite excited to try it out given many people had said a many great things about this restaurant. Sadly, none of the expectations we had were met. Yes, the table-side guacamole is good, but it isn't anything better than an other guacamole recipe when it's made form scratch. The margaritas were definitely tasty and were probably the highlight of the meal. Each of our dinners were at best meh to mediocre. Some ordered tacos, which looked like mini portions you would expect for a child. Things went from okay to pretty bad with with the dish I ordered, the pork and chorizo dish. It almost immediately tasted off and only after a few bites in I knew that this wasn't going to be good. The worst of it all is that of I ended in a pretty clear case of food poisoning, which met I missed out on a full day of fun in Scottsdale due to being stuck in bed.",

I'm definitely going to try to make this at home.   We had the crispy pork & cola lime as an appetizer. We split the pork shoulder tacos between the two of us. The corn tortilla were fried, giving it a nice texture. I love how they put all the tortillas on a salt block.    We made a reservation for patio dining. I love their patio - definitely dine outside if it's available. They have a huge fan that keeps it comfortably cool, especially in this hot AZ weather.

The environment is very trendy and LA vibe...dark, good music, great atmosphere and really really tasty food!! Started with spicy margarita which was perfect, also tried the pomegranate margarita which was strong with a sweet taste...strawberry basil mojito tastes like a good tasting drink...then the food... Started with street corn which was simply amazing!! Then had the beef on a stick which was marinated perfectly...the guacamole is made table side and amazing...the pork belly was wonderful as well. The short rib was soft and amazing...but the fish tacos was not too good, not tender and little hard, but butternut squash taco was incredible!! Ordered too much food for 4...was stuffed after appetizers...",

The Mission looks like it could be a fine spot to enjoy a margarita and share some small plates, but when I stopped by I got the impression that they are happy to rely on tourists who are in the area and have no desire to ensure that your experience is a positive one. Being seated in a largely empty restaurant was somehow a struggle, as we were informed that \"the tables are dirty and need to be cleaned.\" One menu was given to our table of three in a dark corner of a very dark restaurant, and while the drink menu is extensive we were informed that several options were not available. Three margaritas and an order of guacamole came out to about $75, with none of it being exceptionally memorable. I would recommend you visit one of the many many other fine restaurants in the surrounding area. Yes, The Mission is perhaps a more attractive looking space than most, but when service is this poor any pretence of a high end experience is basically lost.",

If I were to try and pin down the reason for my favorable opinion, it would be something about the entire dining experience.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale, the actual restaurant is an old church.  At least on the outside.  It always feels like a party is happening on the inside.  Indoor and outdoor tables are available.  There is a vast array of margaritas, most come with actual lime juice, and other sundry drinks.    The dinner menu also boasts a myriad of options.  The food is always great.  I'm always trying to decide between several drinks and several entrees.  Although, I usually order several drinks.  The ambiance is festive and loud with dim lighting.  If you want a quieter dining experience, come during the day light hours.  Often, my daughter accompanies us.  There is free parking near by, and a variety of after dinner locations within easy walking distance, such as ice cream parlors.",

We arrived right on time and our table was not ready (I get it, it happens). A waitress immediately came over and apologized and said the manager would like to give us complimentary drinks, which I think is pretty standard. So we all put in a drink order and 20 minutes go by no drinks and no table... 30 minutes go by and we are seated and the waitress comes back and says actually we can't give you the complimentary drinks now because you're at the table... I realize this isn't the watiresses fault and ask to speak with the manager. He refuses to come to our table and proceeds to scream in the face of our young female waitress right in front of our table. She comes back and apologizes again and says she can give us shots instead. We all ask if she is okay after the scene he just caused, and her response was \"it's fine he does it to all of us\". How unprofessional! I was appalled and ask that he come to our table again... he refuses. We proceeded to enjoy our meal, but knowing this place is managed by such a jackass I certainly will look elsewhere before returning.",

We went here for the weekend brunch the other day and our socks were completely knocked off by how amazing it was.   To start...it's just such a quaint and unique restaurant. The salt bricks...the old chandeliers...the antique furniture...it all makes you feel like you've stept into some fine dining establishment in a South American town.  Food was AMAZING. To start the chips were fresh and crispy and the salsa tasted almost like it had just been made minutes ago. We then ordered a Black Bean Arepa with fries and a Cinnamon Almond Waffle. The BBA was delectable...two freshly made thick corn tortillas with egg, cheese, black beans, and peppers...it really hit the spot. The fries were a mix of regular and sweet potato, and honestly are some of the best fries I've had in recent memory. Thin, crunchy and fresh tasting. The waffle was also sent from heaven...drizzled with candied almonds, cinnamon, cream, and topped with cinnamon ice cream. It was basically a wedding of breakfast and dessert in all the right ways. Top top it all off...this all came out to a mere 19 bucks. Unbelievable. Incredible value for your money when you're eating at a nice place like this. You could easily go spend the same amount of money at Denny's for God's sake.   It wasn't very busy when we were there and I'm not sure why. I'm guessing this place is more hoppin' around dinner time, and I can't wait to try their dinner menu. You've been warned though...you're missing out big time if you don't try brunch here. If they stop serving it due to a lack of demand, I might just explode like the dude at the end of Big Trouble in Little China.   GO HERE. 5/5.",

Got there at 4:30p and was told the dinner menu wasn't available til 5p (wish I had been told that when I made the reservation). So we order drinks and tableside guacamole and chips. I had the Primrita which was a good start. At 5p, we ordered dinner. I ordered the Green Chile Duck Confit and hubby ordered the Flat Iron Steak Tacos. He really liked his tacos; meat was tender and flavorful. My dish was over salted to the point that I almost couldn't finish it (even the tequila didn't help to cleanse my palate). I didn't detect the green chili, but my biggest complaint is, I couldn't see what I was eating. It was SO dark, you couldn't see what was on your plate. Good thing I carry a mini flashlight in my purse. It came in very handy for flashing my plate to see what I was eating and what was left. Our server left her little light so we could read the dessert menu, but we passed.  All and all, the service was good, and the offerings were good, just too heavy on the salt.",

    "text": "On the expensive side.  Wait staff very accommodating.  They were a few minutes late with our reservation and gave the four of us frozen daiquiris.  We ordered scallops, chicken tacos, and something else.....can't remember.  The three tacos were skimpy.  We thought they were appetizers.  There were about 7 - 8 large scallops cut in half with some dipping sauce.  No side dishes.  Everything a-la-carte.  One of us had an anniversary and they brought us a bread pudding dessert on the house.  Have to give that a 5 out of 5.  Very dark atmosphere inside and out. - we ate outside  Couldn't read menus.  The wait staff brought us flashlights.  I would rate The Mission out of (5) stars.............5 for the wait staff.  1 for value.  4 for taste for whatever food they brought us.  3 for atmosphere.  Overall - 2 - 3 stars.  If you like expensive / fancy with small portions, this is the place for you, but there are much better restaurant values to be found.",

    "text": "Terrible. Probably the worst dining experience ever.Went there with 3 girlfriends for dinner last night. This is going to be a long one because it's fresh in my mind and I still can't get over what happened.   We were seated right away, but had a reservation so expected to be. Our server, Heidi O (that's what it said on the receipt) was downright nasty. She became impatient with one of my friends (who is granted a very particular eater) when she asked questions about the menu and told her that she just wanted her chicken cooked plainly and not with any spices. We ordered chicken and fish tacos and some guacamole. One friend ordered at Blood Orange margarita ($14!!!!!, are you serious??!!?) The guacamole was delicious and we got plenty of chips and salsa for the table. Heidi never came back to check on us.  Our food arrived and the chicken was done all wrong and it was a mix of white and dark meat which our entire table's opinion is disgusting since none of us eat dark meat. The fish tacos were decent. although I prefer them flour battered instead of beer battered which is how they ended up. In my opinion as a fish taco lover, beer batter just takes over and all you end up tasting is the batter. We sent the chicken back and replaced it for steak. Those never came back and Heidi never came over again to see how we were doing. The two of us who had the fish tacos finished eating before the other two ever got their steak taco replacements. Now mind you Heidi hasn't been back since we had to flag her down about the chicken tacos. We literally tackle her once more and let her know that we are done and one of us had a flight to catch so please just send the check and forget about the steak. She walks off mid-sentence and returns a little while later with the check and FINALLY the steak tacos come out. The manager heads over with them on their plates and I explain that we can't wait around to eat them that we have to leave. He agrees to put them in bags for us and they remove them from the check. No apology from Heidi or the manager, by the way. The manager just said that they have a small kitchen and it's not equipped to handle things when an order is wrong and has to be redone.   So we wait for the new check to come and Heidi comes back with our bill . We have to wait another 10 minutes for her to come back (we've already mentioned twice that one of us has a flight to catch) and we are in the middle of explaining that one of us needs change of a twenty when she snatched the credit card out of my friends hand and starts walking away. I've had it at this point, so I bang as hard as I can on the table and she comes back over, snatches the money out of my hand and walks off. It was like we were in the twilight zone. I'm not even kidding. We all just stared at eachother like what the F*CK is going on here?!?!  Three of us are from NYC and now live here so we are used to places in this price bracket that want to please their customers. This woman needs to be trained on how to deal with people who have a) questions about ingredients and b) picky eaters. Wouldn't hurt if she learned not to snatch things out of peoples hands and walk away from guests mid sentence.  It's a lovely looking restaurant and the atmosphere is perfect for a date. Very romantic setting. The menus are covered in this absulely gorgeous thick leather. And maybe if you are not in Heidi's section you will have a better experience. You have to be a real lover of Mexican food to enjoy this menu. It's called latin american fusion, but I think it leans more towards American Mexican food.  Would never go back and certainly wouldn't recommend it except for the guacamole.",

We liked the cocktail choices, but asked if the bartender would make slight changes (vodka instead of tequila) and they were happy to oblige , and were delicious. Had a pineapple/mint with ginger combo...tasty with Vodka.   We shared the table made guacamole which was good, not spectacular like some reviews here ...and we shared the pulled pork tacos for two. Yes the homemade tortillas are small (about 2 1/2 in. diameter) but there was plenty of the pork, and very delicious. Came with sides of roasted tomato salsa, a honey bar b que sause, onions and cilantro...the tortillas are kept warm on a warm block of salted rock..it was lit from underneath somehow.  Creative and pretty presentation.  Plenty of food for two women who didn't want to be stuffed.  Waitress was sweet, helpful , pretty and smiled each time she spoke to us and served us.  Bar and restaurant were full on a friday night with a younger, energetic crowd.  Happy we went! Enjoy!",

    "text": "Excellent mini tacos with \"upscale\" fillings are served at lunch. We've had steak, pork & short rib. It was 2 vs. 1 with pork winning over short rib for best taco. Honestly, they were all yummy. My only \"beef\" is that you can't mix tacos in an order. So you have to be with a couple of people to try different toppings. The tableside guacamole is good since you get to determine \"heat\". I loved that they put in fresh jalapeno & Serrano chiles as well as fresh garlic & lime juice. Just like I make at home. The corn appetizer is a must! You can eat it on the cob or cut off. Done it both ways - no preference. The lovely sauce they put on corn just takes it over the top. Chips are light & crisp and salsa is fresh & just the right amount of heat. Unfortunately, we tried to get in for dinner, but there was almost a 2 hour wait & getting reservations meant doing it in advance of our trip. Maybe next year.",

    "text": "Whoa! I was so happy when I was taken here while in Scottsdale.  This food is great and seeing as we don't have the best Mexican food where I'm at this was perfect.  There was quite a few of us that were here - total of about 8 people and we were seated quickly.  I heard this place is really popular so calling ahead is suggested.  I started off with the drink menu and I got a variety of drinks, honestly, I forgot what I drank prior to the tequila that we got.  Anyways, I was told that I had to get the guac both spicy and mild so we ordered them both.  The spicey had a nice kick to it and it was delicious.  It was so good that I was craving for more.  It was a little insane to have such a guac crave after lots of drinks but it was the best guac I've had thus far.  We ordered so many appetizers I think we cleared the entire menu and then went straight for the tacos.  There were so many of us that we just ordered a variety of tacos and they were amazing.  At the end we were so stuffed I wasn't sure i would be able to go out dancing again but needless to say the Mission hit the spot!  You can't miss this if you're in town.  I'm planning my next vacay to Arizona and we are definitely going to be going here and then hit up the nightlife.  Awesome spot and could really be dangerous if you came for a happy hour -- 6pm will turn into 12am very quickly!",

As of now I will give The Mission 4.5 stars out of 5 only because we did not have any entrees, we split several appetizers, so I can't give that extra half star or even maybe take that half star away.     We split the brisket torta, which was heavenly.  After my first bite I was in love.  The aji amarillo sauce I could spread all over everything I eat.  Next we had the Almejas Al Vapor and all I have to say is that this soup is transcendental.  I have never tasted anything like this before.  The broth is a yellow pepper base and I never knew you could get this type of sublime flavor from a yellow pepper.  Clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo, and roast corn.  Please bring me more of this delicious soup!!!     Then our bartender / waiter brought us out a complimentary order of the grilled street corn.  I do have to say that I am not a fan of spicy food whatsoever but the chile paprika and cojita sauce was done so tastefully that I extremely enjoyed it.     The decor, is intimate.  This is a place you would love to take someone to impress them.  Candle holders carved out of Peruvian sea salt, a classy act right there.  Somber atmosphere, at tentative and attractive waitstaff.  Attractive food and an all around great time.  I will be back soon and if not for anything but the soup I will be a very, very happy man.",

I sat on the patio and had a late lunch for one, and it was a very relaxing environment. The server had a vast knowledge of the menu and was able to make recommendations. The crispy rock shrimp tacos were excellently seasoned and perfectly portioned. I also had an appetizer of mole chicken, which was good, but somewhat dry and was not warm when it arrived to my table. I had the Guatamelan Chocolate Pastilla for dessert, which was absolutely delicious; my only recommendation would be that they serve it in a bowl or on a plate with a raised edge. It was difficult to eat the ice cream without something to scoop it against. But on the whole, I had a very pleasant dining experience here and would want to come back to see what the rest of the menu had to offer.",

I have had skirt steak tacos before where some of the morsels were overcooked or dry - not here! Every piece was succulent! As for the price? Sure, the entrees for this type meal, maybe a little steep, but the taco plate prices was fine. You get plenty of food too! I don't know how much people who complained about the taco size, are used to eating. But I was stuffed! Especially after started with some quac & chips! check it out. Worth a stop. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Whoa. Oh, and wow. So, I was debating giving this place four stars because yes it is dark in there and yes the tables are a bit cramped and it did get loud.... but..... I just can't. The food was so good that it completely made up for those things.   The BF and I went here for my (very very belated) birthday dinner (we had made res's somewhere else on my b day that fell through *cough* monarch *cough* and had to make new plans). So I decided to try something a bit different and go to the Mission. I am very glad I did. The BF and I made open table reservations and were seated promptly when we got there. Our waiter was this funny guy named Derek, who, at first I thought I wasn't going to like that much (I have an aversion to trendy scottsdale people) but turned out to be wonderful and make great suggestions all night! So thanks Derek!  The BF and I decided to order a few different small plates to get a feel for the restaurant. We ordered the cola crispy pork belly, the table side guac, the steak tacos, and a side of chipotle honey grits. I also got a Mission margarita. So my margarita comes out and it is really great! I have only had one other margarita that I liked equally. It was extremely fresh and it wasn't made out of that disgusting green sweet stuff that normally makes up margs. I would definitely recommend it (with salt).   We then get the chips and salsa. The salsa is really smokey and reminds me of the salsa at Abuelos, if you've ever tried that. I liked it a lot. So the man who makes the Guac came over and asked how spicy we wanted it, and we told him hot. He then proceeded to mix the guac using all fresh ingredients. It was so good! and so fresh! I liked how I could taste each flavor that went in, from the cilantro to the delicious tomato and jalapeno.... it was all good.... also, it had pinons on it, which gave it a cool texture. I have only had one better guac, and that is at Barrio cafe....   We get the rest of the food, and the portions look tiny, but in reality, they are huge because I just ate half an avocado and a bagillion or so chips. The cola pork belly was Ah. Maze. Ing. I have never had anything like it. It's a crispy sweet and spicy pork with peanut sauce in a lettuce cup. It's like thai mexican fusion. It was the best of the meal. The steak tacos were also wonderful. The BF said it was like eating a new york strip in a taco. It was a little sweet and a little savory... all good. The grits were the only part that were just ok. I liked them, they were creamy and different, but I wouldn't get them again.   So we had to get dessert, as it was my 'birthday' and Derek recommended the pumpkin bread pudding. Holy crap Derek, you are the man! This thing was one of the most delicious desserts I have had, and definitely the best bread pudding. It's pumpkin bread with a little bit of creme brulee, in a sea of wonderful butterscotch sauce (made from real scotch...mind=blown) with the perfect amount of ice cream and little crunchy seeds for texture. Whoa. Just whoa.   All this, and the bill was like 65$... that's wonderful! We could come and not get drinks and not get grits and it would be an affordable dinner, which is the best part, because I want to go back.... like right now.",

Negatives: 1. We waited close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it. 2. My margarita was way overpriced ($13) 3. I ordered the Kale salad with chicken. The salad was extremely salty.  4. My lunch date order the taco trio. We were told they were \"street\" sized, however the  tortillas were approximately 2.5 inches in diameter. It looked like an appetizer.   Save your money and go somewhere else!",

    "text": "This place really has a great Scottsdale/Southwest/Sexy vibe.  Walking in I am always impressed by the sexy southwestern decor.  Kinda dark with mirrors, candles and a glowing salt block wall that separates the kitchen from the dining area.  These guys have a great tequila and margarita selection.  It would be a mistake to head straight to the dining area without stopping in the bar first for a drink.  I've been here on Sundays for the \"Pig Out\" all you can eat pork event which is great.  This recent visit they were offering a five course fixed menu with wine pairings for $65/person.  I love these type events because the chef can experiment with new recipes and as a guest I get to try many new flavors and wines.  This meal progressed from scallops to roasted guinea hen to halibut to Berkshire pork to chocolate cake.  My favorite was the pork and least favorite course was the chocolate cake with the lime sorbet.  The wines were mostly from Spain with a Malbec and Champagne added to round out the pairings.  Get on their email list for upcoming events or just stop in for a meal.  This place is consistently good.",

    "text": "This is one of those sunshine stories, the mission has succeeded in launching their own twist on Mexican cuisine.  /Service When I first arrived I was greeted in a very personable way. I was promptly seated and soon our waitress arrived. Let's talk about the waitress for a second. Professional and personable, and did not hesitate to give her own opinion on dishes and drinks.. neither did she say anything negative on anything on the menu, but that is her job after all. I think the service was great, absolutely great.   /Food The food was excellent. The tacos are small, very small.. like taco sliders, but they are tasty. Dont be discouraged by that fact. I went with the chorizo filled pork - I wouldn't recommend it, but I loved the set up, the presentation, how fresh it seemed. But if there is one thing that is a must to try at this place, it is the tableside guacamole. They mix it before your eyes and you can comment and suggest yourself, and the result was amazing.  /Drinks I think the drinks are too expensive. Yes, this is Scottsdale and you have to accept this fact - but I am saying this because despite the raving about the mixologist, I just wasn't impressed. Plus one for ingenuity, minus one for drink list limitation.   /Ambience Fantastique. No but really, it is really good and the service (as I already over sold) plays a big part of this. They are the life of the atmosphere. But the layout is cool and they have focused on making this cozy and intimate, but not too intimate. They have found the baby bear kind of middle ground.. (you know, Goldilocks?)",

I took my son there last night to celebrate his college choice and we had one of the best meals EVER and the waiter was AMAZING. His name was Sal and he took the time to really explain the entire menu and make recommendations.  Then, he carefully timed everything so we did not feel rushed.  So nice.    We had the duck empanadas for an app and they were very good, but rich because of the foie gras.  My son also had a delicious soup but I don't remember the name.  I had the scallops for an entree and my son had the filet.  Both were fantastic.  I had asked for the scallops to be well done and they were but still moist.  The steak was amazing...even beat The Capital Grille, my son said.  Dessert...ahhhhh.  Pumpkin bread pudding AND the churros with chocolate shake.  A True feast!  My son said he is saving his money to bring his girlfriend here.  Such a wonderful restaurant, especially for a special occasion!  PS Our waiter Sal said to come back for Sunday brunch..I think we may do that!",

    "text": "We went for dinner on a Wednesday and it was jam packed with the \"see and be seen\" and the want to be seen but not sure how to pull it off.   Me I'm here for top quality food.  One of the things that drives me crazy is when the hostess (or one of) is invariably on the phone with someone trying to make or edit a reservation... And she(or most of the time its a she) has the reservation computer tied up and cant be bothered to greet or acknowledge the people in front of them. Here's a thought PUT THEM ON HOLD and talk to us. The couple standing right in front of you for almost 10 minutes. The ones on time for their reservation, with cash in hand... just a thought  On the plus side The Mission called to confirm our reservation and had asked us if there were any food allergies (yes). When our server arrived at the table he had a small printout listing our callouts. How smart is that!!  We ordered the pork shoulder taco portion designed to be shared... Very good and really is enough for 2.   We had read all these rave reviews of the kitchen street corn so decided to order it as a side dish. Due to a kitchen mix up we actually got 2 portions 1 on the cob the other with just kernels in a bowl. The kernels only is very much the way to go. The corn on the cob looked like lollipops on (not so solid) sticks. It was very messy and cooled quickly... Who wants cold corn on the cob?   The food and margaritas were both solid, not spectacular with flavor profiles not nearly as complex as Fuego Bistro.  Living in the Bay Area we are used to high restaurant prices but both felt The Mission was not the best value for the money...  We skipped dessert and went to the old school ice cream parlor nearby.  Would recommend your doing the same.",

The drinks are incredible but expensive, the appetizers are so tasty but expensive, and the food is pretty damn good (but not over the top amazing) and expensive.  See a pattern?  While I do like it here very much, I really think its just overpriced for what you get.  Certainly worth going a time or two though.

    "text": "I had dinner here the other week with my sister and mom when they were visiting me for a few days. I had heard good things about The Mission from many Scottdalers prior so I figured it would be a nice play for a special occasion dinner and I was not disappointed in the slightest. This place is fantastic.    The first thing that strikes you is the atmosphere. It's cool. I am trying to think of a better adjective but cool sums it up perfectly. The place is dimly lit and decorated to give this chilled out laid back vibe, and the staff make you feel like you have been dining there for years. The building actually used to be a church so it has this really unique setting that totally works. Try to picture a church that was converted into a saloon that has been given a major upgrade in style.    Now the restaurant was pretty full when we arrived and we had not made a reservation so we sat at the bar while awaiting our table. We enjoyed a round of simple yet delicious margaritas and snacked on some chips and guacamole that was made fresh right in front of us. The wait was not too long, about 20 minutes, so I wouldn't say that a reservation is important but I can imagine on a weekend it may be much busier.    The service was excellent from the moment we stepped into the restaurant. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who promptly pulled together some bar stools for us and found a server to start us with some refreshments. Our server, who's name I am afraid I have forgotten, was great. She was very personable and made us feel right at home. She recommended a dew dishes which we tried and loved and she regularly checked up on us to see if we needed anything else.    The food was great though on the pricier side. We tried the Duck Carnitas Empanada (my favorite), Chorizo Porchetta, Green Chile Duck Confit, and the Chilean Salmon. Each dish was delicious and the portions were enough to ensure satisfaction. The prices are on the higher side, roughly $30 per main course, but I feel like the value for money is definitely there and I didn't wince when the bill came along. I strongly recommend the duck empanada as well; it was so delicious we ended up ordering an extra one after already finishing an order.    This is definitely a place that suits the adult crowd better than the family crowd as a dining destination. This is a great place for to bring a date in my opinion. The atmosphere is great and would work well with a romantic setting plus the food and drinks will help make a great distraction if things aren't going great. After work drinks would be great here as well as well. If you like Mexican food or just good food in general then you must check this place out.",

He not only seemed annoyed, but still popped by every few minutes to see if we \"knew what we wanted yet\".

    "text": "Truly one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale- and that's saying A LOT as we are blessed with an abundance of exquisite food here.  Came here for the first time on a first date and absolutely loved every moment -company included! ;-)  Firstly, the decor, ambiance, candles, and dim lighting here is really beautiful and romantic.   I had a superb white Sangria and we ordered the tableside guac and housemade chips to split. It was a generous helping and both were astoundingly delicious. I will say that while the guacamole is stellar here, it does not (IMO) unseat the undisputed Guac champion- Barrio Queen (which is right around the block).   The chips were better here though.  Main course- I ordered the Florida Grouper with Paella reduction, banana crab croquette, brussels sprouts, crispy quinoa & pickled gueros. This fish was SO BOMB. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Who knew Grouper was so good? The brussel sprouts (which is not my fave vegetable by any means), crispy quinoa, AND the crab cake were also uber yum-tastic!  My date had the Alaskan Cod which came with Purple & romanesco cauliflower, toasted farro, leek & garlic mote & smoked pasilla sabyon- he raved about how tasty it was.  For dessert we ordered the fried bananas which came with dulce de leche ice cream (or gelato?) and this outstanding peanut butter moussey-stuff on the side. So freakin' yummy OMG.  It's pricey, but 100% worth the cost. Will definitely return!",

The service was very slow, but I'm blaming that on the holiday, not the staff. The duck carnitas empanada was a perfect appetizer while we waited for our steak tacos and our chorizo porchetta. The tacos were great according to my sister, and my chorizo porchetta was very tender with a light skirt crust....I just didn't like the flavor of the chorizo too much. We skipped dessert because we were having it elsewhere.   Pretty decent pricing for what you get, and the manager came out to greet us when we got our appetizer (maybe just for the holiday?). I was kind of annoyed though, because I requested sweet corn puree with my porchetta, and the waiter, though he checked back several times and audibly noticed it wasn't there, never brought it.   But I would certainly go back for an occasion or just a nice, inspired meal.",

    "text": "I have been to The Mission three times now and every experience has been amazing. From the margaritas to the entrees and desserts, everything I've tried has been delicious.  The first visit was for our company holiday party. We started inside at the bar for cocktails and appetizers. I ordered a coconut margarita that was amazing. Honestly, that was the star of the night.   After the holiday party, my husband and I stopped by for dinner one night. We sat on the back patio, which feels comfy and intimate - like someone's backyard. There are lights strung up, white patio furniture, and random bushes/trellises to round out the foliage. For dinner, I ordered the scallops - which were delicious. Overall, we had a fun evening.   My third and most recent visit was with my in-laws. My father-in-law read about their tableside guacamole in a magazine and was dying to try it. Thus, we stopped by on a busy Saturday night. Unfortunately, we didn't call ahead and make reservations but rather showed up and had to put our name on the list. The hostesses were extremely nice and told us the wait would be roughly 45 minutes. We went to another nearby restaurant for drinks and after 45 minutes, walked back to The Mission. We told the hostess we wouldn't mind sitting outside and they were quick to seat us. We ordered the tableside guac (not as exciting as my father-in-law thought it would be) but delicious. Since they make it tableside, you can say yay or nay to ingredients if you are a picky eater (which my father-in-law is). We also ordered a round of margaritas. I tried to blood orange margarita - which was good but not very sweet. They no longer have the coconut margarita on their cocktail list, which I sorely miss!  For our entree, my husband and I split the chorizo porchetta - pork shoulder, chorizo, and white bean puree. It was melt in your mouth perfect. So tender, juicy, and flavorful. I would come back for this alone!   Overall, The Mission is a great place for an intimate date, anniversary, or a place to take friends/family if you want to impress them.",

The bartenders were both very friendly and made excellent drinks. We also had the guacamole and homemade chips while we waited. Our server was really friendly as well.

Four stars because when a bus boy was clearing plates he knocked the spoon out of our guacamole and onto the table.  He put the spoon back into our guacamole, an absolute no no especially given we were dining al fresco and sparrows were routinely landing on and walking across empty tables.  The pumpkin bread pudding was out of this world - light and fluffy pumpkin bread with pepitas and pomegranate, creamy vanilla ice cream and a scotch whiskey sauce all worked together to create a remarkable pudding.  The French press coffee was a.nice ending to an almost perfect meal.  We will definitely go back.",

It was 2 of the attendees birthdays so I called in advance to request dessert be brought out with a candle or something festive. I was told this was noted and they would let the server know. When we were sat our server came over and asked if we were celebrating anything special.....really?? I headed to the \"bathroom\" and let the hostess know I had called in advance re the birthdays and she said she would make sure the desserts happened. The end of the meal came and the waitress came over asking how we were feeling-all the girls said they were full. She then just dropped the check. WTF, totally ignored all the requests I made for recognition of a birthday. I said something to the manager when we left who proceeded to find me outside the restaurant to tell me that once the girls said they were full she decided they didn't want dessert and to ignore my requests. No matter what you don't blame your mess up on the customer-the customer is always right.  Btw, the food was unmemorable, don't waste your time unless you want to be treated like you are an idiot.",

Drinks came fairly soon, but the appetizer took longer then what should have, which was the Shrimp Anticuchos, which came with three shrimp, and we opted for a fourth one at our waiters suggestion, at $4.00 per shrimp...a costly appetizer at $16.00! But on the positive side they were delicious, and came with a couple of very good sauces. The wait for our tacos took way too long! The waiter came by and said, Oh you don't have your food yet?....let me check on that! The pork shoulder tacos were delicious, but came with the smallest soft taco I have ever seen! My wife's chicken tacos were good...but nothing spectacular. Living in the area I heard this place was a \"must go experience\"....guess we just hit it on a bad day!",

The second they sat myself and my date down, I knew it was all down hill. Worst seating I have ever experienced.   The food was subpar, nothing to rave about. I got the skirt steak tacos, boring. The tostada appetizer, boring. Black bean puree, boring. All and all, the food was bland, tasteless, and way over priced for what it is.   Not worth a trip there again.",

I had the kale and orange salad, which was good, but not as outstanding as all the reviews on this website would lead me to believe. W side of white beans, which were yummy also. My date had the steak tacos, which he thought tasted like salted cardboard. But I didn't try them so can't say. They looked good. Anyhow, I am looking forward to going again but next time will try the guacamole and the squash tacos. Oh and the bread pudding.",

    "text": "So good! We were visiting Phoenix for the 4th of July weekend and had no idea where to eat. We found this place through yelp and made the trip to Old Town Scottsdale. When we arrived, we immediately noticed the nice decor and ambiance. When we were seated, the server noted that the chef was French trained, and the menu was his spin on classic Latin American and Mexican dishes. The menu had a wonderful range of foods, from pecan smoked grilled fish and meat to high-end versions of street tacos. We ordered the chef's take on Mexican street corn (with mayo, chile, and cojita). This dish is a favorite of mine from taco trucks, but my parents (who had never tried it) were blown away by the great flavors. We also ordered the 1) the chicken street tacos, 2) the Tecate flank steak tacos, and side orders of white bean puree and a mixture of sweet potato and potato french fries. All were excellent! For dessert, we finished with a French press of excellent coffee, and an order of the espresso churros (comes with a delicious Ibarra chocolate milkshake; it's a slightly spicy/cinnamon mexican chocolate that you often see in stores). Every dish was excellent, and I wish I had more time to return and sample the rest of the menu!  If you are in Phoenix and would like a great place with a fine dining atmosphere, high-end versions of Latinx classics, and great service, try The Mission!",

Chips are light crispy thin and served hot. Salsa has a bit of kick which i like and was delicious. I had the steak tacos and they were awesome. I was concerned the three small size tacos wouldn't be enough - boy was I wrong!  They serve them open and flat and loaded with steak and toppings. Trust me you won't be able to fold it and keep all the ingredients in. They are messy but delicious. They have some really interesting tacos and they all look good. And of course their margaritas are phenomenal.  I tried several and loved them all. Service at the table and at the bar was awesome. Great place and cool environment.

They let us store our bags in a back corner and set us out on the patio. The whole patio is shaded. Although in hindsight it was a little too hot and we should have sat inside. It's decorated in the southwest, adobe style and was really beautiful.  The food was amazing. We got guacamole and the grilled street corn for appetizers to split and they were so flavorful! They make the guac table-side. The tacos were delicious! I tried the butternut squash, chicken, and mahi mahi (split with another person). The tacos are really small so keep that in mind when ordering! The mahi was probably my favorite. I don't usually like fried fish tacos but the breading on these wasn't too heavy!

In addition, when you get coffee they bring you a cookie for your coffee which I don't think any other restaurant does. However, it may be a bit too dark in the restaurant and their outdoor patio (in front of their business) is a little too small to fit a large number of people.",

The salsa and chips were soooo good as well, a roasted flavor that was delicious. A great outing with friends on a Saturday afternoon. We will be back soon.",

We shared the pork shoulder tacos and found them so tender and well seasoned. Taylor also made us amazing guacamole fit to our specifications!  If there is one area for improvement, we found the service to be a little slow. I love a relaxing dinner, but we were ready to move on to our next destination and had to wait a while to settle up. That being said, I'd still recommend The Mission for a nice meal out!",

I think it's crazy to pay $15 for a drink.  Can you say rip off? Geez.  No Happy Hour? That's just wrong in Scottsdale.  I would rather go anywhere else for Happy Hour.  Pork shoulder tacos were excellent. Very small street tacos... but just delicious.  Will I go back.... no.... glad I went once to say I've been.... but I like to linger with my food and cocktails... at that price.... one drink and dinner is enough.

My husband made reservations for my birthday dinner a week in advance and made sure to tell them to set aside a nice table for us. Well, we were seated in probably the busiest part of the restaurant, right smack in the middle. When we mentioned that we had requested for a nice table we were told that they had big parties tonight and couldn't accommodate us. Fifteen minutes into eating our dinner our waitress, Jennifer J., asks us to box our food. She didn't even ask if we were done or needed anything. We felt like she just wanted to rush us out of the restaurant. So she boxes our food and then another lady quickly brings my birthday cake, and when we asked for a candle we were told that they ran out. The entire experience was terrible and my birthday dinner was basically ruined! We will definitely not be returning here! Seems like the number of people they sit down for dinner is more important than the quality of service they provide. What a shame.",

Our waitress made great recommendations- from drinks to their soup. We shared the pork tacos with a side of white bean stuff. It was great spread over the tacos. My boyfriend drank a briar rose- a bourbon based cocktail with hibiscus syrup- while I had a blood orange margarita. Both were yummy- I don't love margaritas, but loved mine so much I had two. Our table side guacamole was incredible- some of the best I've ever had. But what killed me was how good their wings were. My boyfriend was in heaven.

    "text": "Hard to find a reservation here on Open Table on the weekend, so Monday was the day. We were there early, too -- 530. Place was empty inside, and outside just a handful of tables. My wife is constantly jabbing me about worrying too much about long waits, so I got more razzing this time. But that would soon change.  We started with the guacamole. It is pricey, but very good. I recommend going with the spicy, but tell them to lay off the salt and the garlic.  For cocktails, my wife got the Blood Orange, i got the Cucumber Jalapeno on the recommendation of our server Canton (sp?). I'm a sucker for cucumber margaritas, and this one did not disappoint. I wanted a pitcher! My wife was not as thrilled with her Blood Orange, but she loves Grand Marnier in her margs. For her second, she went with the house marg and had them add Grand Marnier -- Bingo!  Dinner was outstanding. Simply delicious!  My wife got the braised short ribs. Very good, well-balanced and plenty to take home. We got a side of the street corn and it was also very good, although my one complaint for the night was that the corn was literally swimming in the aioli. I'd recommend a lighter touch on that. I'd also recommend a little more of a toast to the corn. But, seriously, it was STILL really, really good.  I got the Flat Iron Steak, and it was server medium rare. Frickin' delicious! What a great beef taste, and not too chewy -- although, like all flat irons, be sure you are ready for a bit of a fight when you eat this cut of meat. It's not a tenderloin cut. But what a great meat taste. The sauce on top was also delicious.  We took a pass on dessert, although the fried bananas looked very good. I also have to mention that the chips and salsa were a bit disappointing. The chips were generic thin, thin chips and the sauce was a chipotle salsa. Would have loved some house made chips and a fresh pico de gallo.  But those are quibbles. This place ROCKS! And for a couple of people who live almost within walking distance of one of the hottest Mexican places in the Chicago Suburbs, Bien Trucha in Geneva, we have to say this place is a CLOSE second to BT.  We'll be back!",

We chose to sit outside while I wasn't up for the idea it was warm the and to the heaters. We sat in the open area behind the restaurant. The waitress had a different approach and kept telling us what she likes and what we should order. I like recommendations but I am not sure if I like the tonality. She was not interested in even knowing what we like before throwing dish names and price which I kinda found funny. Anyways we ordered what we wanted even if it wasn't something she liked . Their guacamole is out of the world. They make it at the table and it's one of the best I have ever eaten. So please don't miss it if you are around. We then ordered a dish with skewered prawns and another with and washed it down with blood orange margaritas. I don't drink so I chose the virgin option. Finally their dessert was mind blowing.",

    "text": "Do NOT miss the Table-side Guac here, I've never had better food when feeling like I was \"eating in the dark\" (the restaurant's lighting was too dim for my taste. Yelpers' dinner pictures don't do justice to the dishes 'cause everybody had to freaking use the flash which make unappetizing pictures! Please take note and turn up the light a notch, Mission!)  The Short Ribs tacos had a high price tag but the portion is huge. I liked the rustic feeling of the handmade tortillas but the rounds need to be a little bigger, it definitely threw off the meat/flatbread ratio. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, it was caramelized too, so much so that towards the end, you feel like you're eating dessert and not a savory dish.  I can't really comment on other aspects of the restaurant because it was so dark! 3.5 stars.",

Their Primomargarita is so fresh, delicious and smooth! Their guacamole is so delicious with the addition of pumpkin seeds and cojito cheese, and our waitress recommended that we get fresh corn tortillas to go with the guac. That was a great suggestion, and the five small tortillas come on a heated salt chunk. Such a pretty presentation!  My daughter and I shared their Barbacoa tacos with a side of corn. Those tacos! YUMM! The order comes with three street tacos, but we had a late lunch and weren't too hungry. With the appetizers, this was just right. I highly recommend The Mission!",

    "text": "I've been sitting on writing this review for a while now because I really wanted to LOVE this restaurant. But I left kind of just feeling like it was okay.   First of all, I was on a work trip and dinning with my colleagues. The service was fabulous and I really felt as if our table was catered to. We had lots of questions for the server and he answered them all with great sense of humor and attitude. I felt he not only really knew the menu, but he really loved the dishes he recommended.   My favorite, FAVORITE part of the meal was the chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious. I also liked the guacamole, but it was also nothing too special. Just your average, fresh, restaurant guac. We also ordered a salad to share, which I wasn't too jazzed about. I know a few of my colleagues didn't love that the salad didn't seem to match the description. And they were right, the actual dish didn't really match the description.   For my entree I got some tacos with a side of their street corn, served in a bowl. I'll start with the corn because I'd never had Mexican street corn before. So, yea... I'm not a mayo fan and I really felt like this was a bowl of hot corn in a bunch of mayo with crumbly cheese on top. I took one bite and decided it wasn't for me. However, I really feel like if I tried traditional Mexican street corn on the cob, I would like it better. Maybe the ratio of creamy/cheesy/corn is better that way. The tacos were good, but didn't really leave me thinking about them after I left.   Overall, I just didn't really like much beyond the chips and salsa as much as I thought I would. However, I do feel like I'd come back to try other menu items because this is one of those times I feel like I just ordered the wrong thing. My colleagues tried the pork tacos for two and I think that's what I should have done. And just reading the reviews about them proves that I need to come back to try them.",

BUT--food was not that great and very pricey for what you get . Bland, bland, bland. Had the pork shoulder tacos. That pork was barley seasoned and just thrown in a Hawaiian glaze. Glaze was good, but sugary and the meat itself just had no flavor. Guacamole was very good but the chips were weird, almost plastic. And they were fresh and hot from the oven. I think because they were extra thin something must get added to keep them from breaking up - but it makes the texture so odd. Again, plastic-like.  As much as I'd like to rate this higher for everything else it galled me to pay $34 for bland tacos.",

    "text": "The Mission is a beautiful restaurant with fairly good service, but the astronomical menu pricing, and mediocre food quality leave much to be desired.   Upon recommendation of several Scottsdale residents, and the concierge at my hotel, I went to The Mission last night expecting to be blown away. What I got however, was nothing close.   I arrived to the restaurant shortly after 7:30 and approached the host stand for a table. The hostess was super friendly, and greeted me right away, informing me the wait for inside was currently about half an hour, but there was no wait if I wanted to sit outside. Getting hungry, and not wanting to wait, I elected to go with the outside seating, and was soon after walked out to a nice patio area out back. Within minutes of being sat, my server for the evening, Arturo, stopped by to introduce himself, and see if I had any questions about the menu.  A few minutes later, Arturo returned to take my order, and I ended up going with the Pork Belly Appetizer and Short Rib Barbacoa Tacos.    The Pork Belly Appetizer was quite delicious, although slightly overcooked. Parts of the belly were burnt, making it very tough to eat. The sauces served on the side were all very good though, and really complimented the dish. What drove me crazy about this part of the meal however was the corn tortillas. When I ordered the dish, the server asked if I would like corn tortillas, to which I happily obliged. When the dish came out, they also brought out 4 very small corn tortillas to go along with it.  At no point did the server mention these would be an additional charge. Then the check came, and I discovered not only was I charged for them, but the cost was astronomical. For these 4 mini tortillas, I was billed $10. A staggering $2.50 per tortilla which could not have been larger than a small sand dollar.  The short rib tacos were okay. While the short rib in side was so tender it practically melted in your mouth, the toppings ( b&b pickles and cabbage) really distracted from the flavors of the dish. Moving forward I would suggest the pickles be removed or served on the side as they did nothing to add to the dish, and this is coming from a guy who absolutely loves pickles.  Other than the pricing issue with the tortillas, I had no issues with service, and was actually fairly impressed. Arturo and his serving assistant were always nearby if I needed anything, and my glass never went empty.  Based on this experience, I would not likely return to The Mission again in the future, but would not recommend against it, just that you consider other options.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying-- whenever I decide on a place for lunch or dinner Mexican/Latin/Spanish food is rarely (uhm... never) at the top of my list. But, it was my boyfriends 21st birthday, and he'd been talking about going here for a while. Knowing that they had a pretty good drink selection, I decided to take him.  The place is smack in the middle of Downtown/Old Town Scottsdale, so be sure to arrive a bit early and be able to walk a little ways, because they don't have their own private lot (it's all street parking). Anyhow, the outside is very plain and simple- like an actual Spanish missionary-type building. Despite the simplicity to the exterior, the interior is so much more lavish. So much up-scale decor and style, I was blow away!   Anyhow, we sat down and had the most pleasant and nice waitress that we've had in a while at any dining experience. She had short blonde hair and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and seemed to genuinely care. She took our drink orders and was so nice about it being my boyfriends birthday! After checking ID, she brought us the blood orange margarita and the watermelon mojito. According to the boyfriend, both drinks were really good and really strong-- I guess that's a good thing considering the drinks are pretty pricey- $12-14 a piece.   Anyhow, when she came back we ordered the tableside guacamole to start. Awesome concept, you get you add in exactly what you want, you get to determine how spicy you want it (we got the hot version) and you get to watch it being made! Aside from the interesting concept, the guacamole itself was SO good. I really haven't had fresh guac like that ever. The only downside is that the portion is a tad small for $12.   Our waitress came back in a timely fashion, and took the time to explain the menu in detail to us. We ended up ordering the barbacoa tacos and the crispy rock shrimp tacos. The wait for the food was short, and when they came out I was amazed. I have NEVER, EVER, EVER eaten a taco that mind-bogglingly delicious. How it works for the tacos is you get three tiny little housemade tortillas that come with heaps of meat or shrimp or whatever you decide on top- kind of like an open-faced sandwich concept. Anyhow, the rock shrimp were my favorite. The shrimp were cooked to crispy perfection, but not overly-battered. The shrimp tasted fresh and juicy, and the cabbage and such that came with it was delicious as well. Make sure to squeeze some fresh lime on top for an extra kick! My boyfriend ordered the barbacoa tacos, and they were honestly amazing as well. I've really never eaten meat that tender in my life. It was super flavorful and melt in your mouth delicious!   Once we finished, we waited a bit for our plates to get cleared, but to our surprise our waitress brought us a sparkler with a complimentary dessert for my boyfriends birthday. The dessert was a warm pumpkin bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream, and gosh was it delicious. I would most definitely recommend it. The service got pretty slow toward the end of our meal, but honestly it didn't really deter too much from the great food.   The bill came- around $80, but I was so willing to pay the price for a great meal and good service (FINALLY)! Would most definitely recommend to anyone looking to try something out of the box!",

    "text": "The Mission bills itself as a modern Latin restaurant inspired by cuisines of Spain, Mexico, Central and South America utilizing French cooking techniques. What does this mean? Expect the unexpected. If you don't have the cojones to try something new, this may not be the place for you. Tip! - if you're not sure about something on the menu, ask plenty of questions, more on that later.   Despite arriving 10 minutes prior to my reserved time we were quickly seated and our server came right over to take our drink order. The house margarita's were good enough to make me vow to never again drink a margarita made from that premixed high fructose crap. I have officially kicked that habit.   The first course was a Peruvian clam stew, otherwise known as \"Almejas Al Vapor\". Incredible! Imagine the best soup de poisson you've ever had now add that to the best posole you've ever had and turn all that into a thick, creamy stew and voila! - you've got yourself one amazing dish. A perfect amount of spiciness, yet you don't even realize it because of all the other amazing flavors lurking within.   Second course was the chorizo porchetta with white bean puree. Basically, a very tender braised pork shoulder wrapped around a small piece of Mexican sausage. This dish was very good but not great, and I blame myself. The meat had a fairly strong smoky flavor which I personally don't care for. This might be due to the mesquite fired Plancha grill that I'm just not used to. However, I can see how others with an alternative palate would adore this dish. Again, this was my fault, I should have asked the server \"what does it taste like\" before ordering.   For desert I had the espresso churros with ibarra chocolate milkshake. The milkshake was great, the churros on the other hand were a bit overcooked, dare I say... charred. A good churro is crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the center. Granted, this will be very difficult for The Mission because their churros are very thin. For a churro of this size, there's probably a fine line between a limp piece of greasy dough or a brittle, black stick of coal.   After dinner the server brought each of us a shot of tequila. A nice gesture as she knew that it was a going away meal for my dinner companion who is moving to Texas.   As a whole, the experience at The Mission was excellent. Highly recommended.",

That being said, I have to say the bad:  1.  Parking not great.  2.  When we showed up, they gave our table to another couple right in front of us, even though we had reservations.  3.  They had run out of menus, so we had to wait for them... for over 20 minutes.  4.  I was most looking forward to trying the Texas grits, and when they didn't show up, I asked our server about them, and he told me he was sorry, but they were out of them.  That's fine, but I wish he had told me sooner.  However, again, the personality of the server was nice and accomodating, and the flavor of the food at The Mission is delicious.",

A bit dark until your eyes adjust but it's a beautiful setting. Perfect for anything. We sat at the community table in the bar and even at 2pm on a Sunday it was still fairly busy. Server Angeline was very attentive and made good recommendations. Honestly I don't think you can go wrong with anything in this place. The street tacos are small but extremely flavorful and filling. I had the pork and hubby had the shrimp. Table side guacamole is a must and I don't think I've had better salsa anywhere in the Valley. This is a definite return for me!",

Decor:  Outside really does look like a pre-historic mission, but the inside looks like it's been gutted out to be placed with modern decor while still holding onto a \"missionary\" style.    Food:  I absolutely love the guacamole and I'm not even a guacamole fan.  It has a nice balance of spice and limeness which compliments the fatty goodness of guacamole.  I opted for the shrimp chipotle skewers and they were delish!  Plump, spicy, and dipping sauce was awesomeness!  They have dipping sauce that leaves your mouth with a mini burn sensation which I strangely enjoy.  When I'm in town, I make it a point to have @ least one team dinner @ Mission Inn weekly.   All I can say is my taste buds dances with joy at Mission Inn.",

(I do like the \"speakeasy\" effect of the restaurant decor.) Food choices were not extensive for brunch but we had the guacamole prepared tableside.  It was delicious, very chunky and full of goodies.  We ordered medium; it was a little too hot for me but husband likes the heat!  He had the all you can eat pork tacos and I had the steak tacos.  Sides we ordered poblano grits ( I like any kind of grits but these were excellent, not too hot) and the pureed black beans (nice with slight garlicky flavor).  I had 2 pomegranite margaritas.  The first one went down so nice I couldn't resist.  One of the best of this flavor margarita I've ever had.  Only downside was pesky flies on the patio--they need to address this, but food/drink excellent.",

We made a reservation online, which was really convenient especially for a holiday.  The margaritas are really good.  I had the primarita, which the server recommended as it is the most popular.  It was really good.  The boyfriend ordered a smokehouse margarita, which definitely pulled through with it's name.  It had a smokey flavor and a spicy kick.  We started out with the grilled street corn, which came with a mayo-based sauce that was incredibly flavorful, and a little spicier than I expected, but in a good way.  I ordered the short ribs, and the boyfriend ordered the chorizo porchetta.  Both were very flavorful.  I really enjoyed the cheese sauce that came with the meat.  The ambiance and decor were perfect. I read reviews stating that it was too dark, but it was never too dark for me to read or see what I was eating.  Our server was very friendly and our glasses were always filled.  We would definitely go again!",

Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called \"Table side guacamole\" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said \"Happy Valentine's Day!\" and \"Happy Birthday!\" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!",

This was not told to us beforehand, and if we had known we would have come another evening, as we don't care for outside seating.  Instead of accommodating us, we were left to take it or leave it.  So we left.  We know the food is very good, as we've been to the restaurant many times before--we live in the area, as opposed to the many patrons who are visitors.  So, MIssion, when the economy tanks again or it's summer and you need the local residents to help you make it, good luck.  Not to say we won't be going there again, but we certainly won't be recommending you to our friends and visitors.  And by the way, Los Sombreros was thrilled to welcome us back and the food is just as good, if not better!",

I've read some mixed reviews, and was hesitant about spending the money and hitting an off night, but when my wife and I ate here it was fantastic!   The entry way through the open courtyard is very inviting, the decor and lighting is classic and dark, yet hip and upbeat at the same time. The music does have a surprising range to it, but it all worked for us and it actually added another side to the dining experience that you don't usually find. It FELT like a night out at a lounge and that's what we were going for. The service was top notch: our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and the food came on time but not too fast. Gave us just enough time in between to enjoy our drinks (I recommend the Caiprihina... I had three and they are super tasty, especially in the hot weather). The manager or owner even came by at one point to ask how everything was.   The food was delicious, and just like others have said, there are so many things to choose from! We had three dishes from the tapas menu and combined they were plenty of food for us both. We had the duck empenadas, some kind of flat gorditas, and one of the pork belly selections. My favorite was the pork, and although the duck was good, the dough on the outside was a bit too thick and overwhelmed the filling a bit. The flavors were wonderful though, and we left very satisfied and not one regret about the price. Stop by for a fun night out!",

Having been there a number of times since the first month they opened (I love the chef's Zinc Bistro too), I have alot of respect for a place that consistently delivers on food and ambiance. Does this place \"try too hard\"?  What the H does that mean? The waiters know the menu? Good. There is alot of wait staff? Good. They push drinks? No.   If you haven't tried the Peruvian clam stew, for first course or even for lunch, you are missing a truly refined dish. The clams and chorizo in the light golden liquid are heavenly. The tortas, especially the brisket, are really flavorful. I have no arguements with those who expound the virtues of their pork and beef dishes at dinner. Try weekend brunch or lunch too.",

Honestly some of the best guacamole I've ever had and I eat it a lot. Delicious desserts. Expect smaller portions though, it's part of the fancy vibe they have. I'm not going to be eating there often, but every time will be great.",

    "text": "This place was suprisingly OK for Arizona restaurants.  The Roast Corn Gordita appetizer is very spicy but very good.  I got the mushroom taco and really did not like it.  But some of my other friends ordered the chicken, pulled pork and the squash tacos and liked them.  The pumpkin bread pudding was very yummy.  I would have just been happy ordering that! lol  being we were there for a bachelorette dinner, they brought out a sparkler with the complementary bread pudding which was a nice surprise for the occasion.  The service was not very tentative so things seemed to drag out.  But i am from the east coast so we like things on a faster pace then most.  If you like this type of food i would recommend trying it out.",

    "text": "First time in with my fiance. Saw how people raved about it so we decided to try it and see what the hype was all about. For me, the most important thing about a restaurant is the first impression. We walk up to the hostess and she asked if we had a reservation, of course we planned this last minute so we said no. She immediately made a face that was not pretty. A face that someone makes when they don't want to do extra work. We now are standing waiting for a response when she calls 2 other hostesses to help her look at availability on her computer. Um ok? They finally figure out where to put us (two people) and let us know that it will be a ten minute wait. We agree and wait. Ended up waiting 45 minutes to get seated. At last, we are put in a corner outside with no Air Conditioner....(take note it's hot as heck) We decide to just brush it off and wait to see if the food is worth it. We order our food and got it pretty fast. Took us about 10 minutes to eat our small taco plate. The waiter Noah was great none the less. Tacos were ok. Didn't care for them but, what was delicious was the fresh guacamole and the churros dessert. Overall, waiter and some of the food was why I give this place 3 stars. I will not refer this place to anyone of my friends or family.",

We let our server, Jonathan, drive the car so to speak.  He quizzed us on our likes and dislikes and brought us our orders (we didn't specifically order).  We had 7 people in our group and every plate was spot on.   We started with the chicken (thigh) tostadas and the crispy cola pork belly tostadas.  They were great; particularly the pork belly ones.  MAN were those good.  My dinner was the Chorizo Porchetta which brought a big hunk of slow cooked pork that shredded beautifully.  Along side this hunka hunka porky love was a salt block carrying 10 small corn tortillas to build little tacos from.  Some tasty accompaniments: sauce, onion, & cilantro, finished the presentation.  It was a fantastic dish.  The other 6 dishes were just as great.  To note: the honey chipotle grits that my buddy got were super tasty.  Especially when you dumped some of their ghost chili sauce (forget what it was called).  Desert was the Pumpkin bread pudding (YUM!) and fried bananas.    All in all, a fantastic place.  Really good.",

I have been to a lot of restaurants in my life, but I have never been treated as rudely as I was at the Mission! The experience was unbelievable!   When we were seated, the hostess asked us if we could finish in an hour.  Yes, of course we could.  We ordered our entrees, had the chips and guac, and about 45 minures later the hostess came to tell us that we  had to move to another table in the patio.  I quickly continued eating my meal until  the manager came to \"thank us for coming\" and my unfinished meal was removed from the table by the bus boy!  The manager had asked not more than 5 minutes before our \"forced removal\" if we wanted more of the sides with our $32 tacos for two and then here he was telling us we had to move, and doing it very rudely. This was an unbelievable experience that I don't ever want to go through again--no matter how good the food is!!",

In addition to the corn, we shared the crispy pork appetizer and two taco platters (skirt steak and butternut squash). Each bite left us wanting more. While the entrees are on the expensive side, the appetizers and tacos are reasonably priced. The table-side guacamole looked amazing and will be a must on our next visit.",

The atmosphere is just beautiful, candles strewn all around ---almost reminiscent of a church (appropriate given the name!)---Eating in the backyard is really an experience on a cooler night.  All of the tacos are phenomenal and have interesting ingredients that just pop.  The street corn is to die for, and the milkshake churro dessert is a go-to for me.  The cinnamon they use in the milkshake is awesome.   The servers are all really knowledgeable, and the service itself is generally outstanding.  It is trendy without being pretentious.   GO GO GO!",

When our tacos arrived, they were about 3\" in diameter.  I'll admit that I had an internal check-didn't look like a lot of food there.   But once we started eating, those thoughts vanished.  Delicious, and there was plenty of food for all to share.  And anyway...here's a concept-leaving a spanish restaurant without being totally gorged on sides of refried beans and rice and melted cheese.   Of particular note, Pork shoulder tacos for 2.  Tasty and tender.  Be ready to spend a little dough, and take the time to enjoy the ambiance and cuisine.",

Has a great feel inside and a nice patio in the front.  I'm not reviewing that though.  Almost every dish we had was fantastic.  We decided to share a bunch of appetizers and entrees among us and the standouts were the Grits (yes, the grits) and the Corn as appetizers.  For entrees, the Chicken was delicious as were all of the tacos.    The service was very friendly and efficient too.  Highly recommend this place.",

First up, the guac is a must must must! It's some of the best guac I've ever had. Seriously, I have dreams about it. I could bath in it. And I may, if they ever let me.  Secondly, the drink menu changes fairly often and although a lot them are on the sweeter side (not my fav), they do have one that I've fallen in love with. Avocado margarita- they have a fancy name for it, but it's an avocado margarita. And it's one of the best drinks in town. It may sound weird, but I'm asking you to try it because if you have taste buds, you'll be happy you did. Third on the list is the pork belly dish. Just eat it. That is all. And lastly is the halibut. I've had this dish the last two times we've eaten here and I will have it again. The sauce they give you to pour over the dish...oh, the sauce. I would have poured it directly into my mouth if it wasn't frowned upon in Scottsdale. The killer food is a great compliment to the awesome ambiance (love the chandeliers!) and the people watching. Make a reservation- the secret's out!",

They were grilled to perfection not at all over cooked which happens all too often with scallops! Had grille octopus on top and serano ham slices that I think were flashed fried... On top of a delicious sauce. Seriously I would injure someone for another serving. Also a great selection of wine which I'm always a fan of. We all shared the espresso churros came with a milkshake that used all my will power not to try (lactose intolerant and all) boo for that btw. Anyways I'm not a dessert person but damn those were tasty deliciousness! Coffee press with dessert too coffee was amazing I'm still on a coffee high.

The table side guacamole is amazing and quite possibly that best Ive had. The food is creative and delicious. Try the butternut squash tacos and honey chipotle grits!

A****knew the menu so well that we really didn't need the menu; she provided all great recommendations, and was where she needed to be when she needed to be there, but was by no means intrusive;  A**** owned her station and made it a point to be at the table upon food delivery to introduce each entree.   The food, albeit, not necessarily common mexican food, perhaps more southwestern, was very good and memorable:  the pork shoulder was tender and well-flavored and filling, same with the salmon;  the guacamole was tasty with great texture; and all the food was also presented welll.   As I have stated in previous reviews, I will not write a negative review; negative just creates more negative, just not my thing; if a business is not managing what it needs to be managed, what is expected to happen, will happen and that is an unfortunate event but again not my thing.   When it comes to the positive, however, I am all over it; positive can only lead to more postive.   A**** was a professional and provided a memorable and amazing level of service.  She killed it.     I also thought the Maitre D' projected well and kept the room turning; he even stopped by the table to check on us.  The room had a certain energy and there was a great amount of teamwork throughout the experience; no one was standing around yet nothing seemed hectic or out of control or rushed.    In Scottsdale, check this place out, have a cocktail, be positive; have fun.",

Thank god I don't eat duck or participate in the manner that these animals are treated.    I would recommend The Mission. But maybe they should re think the duck course prepared. It almost ruined my meal thinking about it. No animal deserves to be tortured alive for human consumption.  Back to vegetarianism for me....",

Shared the pork shoulder taco entree-for-two with my friend; they were good (not great) and not much of them. Our friends seemed to enjoy what they had.  Upside - My wife's scallops came out way-too-salty. She asked the server to have them redone, and they came back oversalted a 2nd time. This time the manager came over, apologized profusely, and offered to comp her a different entree. By this time she had been nibbling on appetizers and just wasn't interested in another entree, so they brought us a variety of desserts (comped) for the table to share.   That's how you treat guests and solve a problem. Extremely well-handled by the server and manager, which is enough to have us give The Mission another try this weekend.",

I was with a party of 4, and we had ordered 3 appetizers, 4 meals, 2 cocktails, 2 ice teas, pretty decent  size bill and meal.  It was my mom's birthday, so I bought her a Dairy Queen cake, her favorite.  The waitress said there was going to be a $3.00 fee to cut the cake per slice. We said that's ok we can cut it ourselves. She then said, she would talk to the chef and see if she can get the fee waived. The general manager heard, and came storming up rudely and said, You brought food into my restaurant. That's why we charge you the 3.00 fee, and continue to talk down to us, as if we had brought in our own meal to the restaurant.  He said every restaurant charges that, which is not True. I have been to many locations, with large parties, where own cakes/ cupcakes have been brought in, and never been treated so rudely. Food was great, but tarnished by the awful and rude general manager. I had planned a party there for reservation for 8, but we will never be returning due to awful general manager.  Too many other restaurants in Scottsdale would be happy to help celebrate.",

The guac was good but not spicy enough, BUT the women asked for it medium.  The duck empanada was enough for 3 people.  One person had street tacos and they were quite tasty. One person had the filet BUT was quite small ( +-3-4 oz for $35).   I had short ribs which were tasty but a again very small portion.   The coffee and chocolate desert was exceptional.    The negatives are the price point is quite high.  I am not complaining but a bit more food on the entrees is warrented.  Ill go again but it wont be weekly thing,  $270 for 3 people is not a weekly venture.",

Nothing worse than a server popping in Avery 5 minutes asking if everyone is ok.... Except a server that never pops in I suppose lol.  But she was great.  The food was awesome. The place wasn't too loud and someone else paid for the meal!  Can't go wrong with any of that!!",

Between the tableside guacamole and stiff margaritas, I was already a happy girl. But then our pork shoulder tacos for two arrived. This was an amazing quivering lump of perfectly cooked pork accompanied by a stack of fresh corn tortillas and fixings. The pork was so tender it could be flaked with a fork. We ate every bite. The side of black beans ranked among the best black beans I've ever eaten.  We liked the Mission so much, we returned for brunch the next morning. I had a bloody Mary, the steak tacos, and of course, a side of black beans. All excellent again, although the steak tacos weren't as memorable as that pork shoulder.  We ate outside both meals to take advantage of the beautiful weather, but inside seemed to have a very cool, trendy vibe. This seemed like a fun place to have cocktail hour with a group.  My only regret is that our trip wasn't long enough for a third visit.",

This time the food really seemed to have slipped.  First of all, i am picky about iced tea.  Theirs tasted like it was from bad tap water or was from the day before.  I expect good iced tea in better restaurants.  Husband got the pineapple pulled pork tacos and i had the short rib.  I had to continue spitting out bites of fat (i realize short ribs are fatty) but it grossed me out.  Husband's was way over sauced and cloyingly sweet.  The chips and the salsa were both overly salty. Overall a disappointment and we wont go back.  Tableside guac was the only decent thing that got this rating the second star.",

The service was attentive and the server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine list.   The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the shortage of menus and napkins. C'mon, it's not like you just opened.  And it was clear from the hostess' comments that this isn't the first time this has happened. Invest in some more menus and napkins so I don't have to share with the rest of the table. (You really have to trust your companions when it comes to sharing a napkin)",

Less calories, but delicious and fresh. The guac is delish and my favorite is the Tecate steak tacos. Best tacos I have ever had! Ok, so there is only 3, but don't let your eyes fool your stomach. There is so much perfectly marinated meat on those 3 tacos it is the perfect amount. We went on Thanksgiving and Tom the manager made us feel especially welcome and appreciated. Usually at end of dinner I have the French Press coffee, but only at The Mission because their blend is so delicious. It's like drinking cinnamon chocolate coffee. Mission is more expensive than most Mexican restaurants,  but you can tell the food quality is extremely important to them. I have no problem paying a little more for fresh, great quality food. It's totally worth it!",

Now, I would think that if a restaurant put in great effort to make the inside look like a picture from a Latin story book (really though, it's beautiful, charming, and authentic) then they would make sure the outside continues that same ambience- but it was a bit dull to me. This is the ONLY critique I have that doesn't pertain to food, and I will most definitely come back, but this time, I'm sitting inside!!   As for the food- excellent. The portions are enough to where you get full but aren't cramping from a stomach ache, and this is important to note when you're choosing a place for date night. The food is fresh and served as an artistic presentation. I really can't choose a favorite as each dish was unique in its own flavors and textures. However, I will recommend the pork belly for an appetizer ;)   If there is one critique I have it is the lack of salt. I'm most certainly not one of those people that needs the salt by my side for every meal and sprinkling it on after every bite. However, I did feel that certain flavors (which are definitely there) could pop out more had there been a bit more salt.   Waiters were very attentive and social. Even the ones who were not serving our table. Very nice ambience and environment.",

All the dishes were wonderful!  especially the Birthday Pumpkin Bread Pudding that came with a Sparkler at the end.   Only Negative is the lighting.

The food is delicious, the atmosphere is sultry and enticing. They have a fun cocktail menu with various margaritas. It was busy and lively!   My parents recently came to town to visit and I could not wait to show off this fun delicious spot. My father has a food allergy which I made known when I made the reservation. His allergy is to more or less a garnish that comes on most Mexican food dishes, which is why I called ahead to make sure they would be able to accommodate us. It is primarily a garnish and should be easily avoided if needed. They assured me that it was not a problem. I had high expectations for this as it is a classier spot and hoped they would have higher standards than other restaurants.   There are obvious dishes that come with this item which he is allergic to, so we steered away from these dishes. We made known his allergy to two different servers whom were taking care of us. They assured us repeatedly that they would pass the message along and would not add this item to any of his food. Every single item that came out to our table was garnished with this item.... every single dish.   It was frustrating that they all assured us they could take care of his needs and they all let us down. I was embarrassed that I had raved about this place for so long to my friends and family just to have them be so disappointed.   I'm sorry to leave this review, but hopefully it can help save someone who has a more severe allergy in the future. Our server was VERY apologetic and sweet. They immediately brought out \"new\" plates of food. I'm sure there was just a mix up along the line of employees, but it seemed pretty avoidable.",

The shrimp tacos were awesome. The shaved corn was spectacular! The service was the BEST we received in our 7 day trip to Scottsdale/Phoenix!   The chandeliers are so pretty in the dining area. The bathroom lighting is gorgeous & the light subway tile is beautiful.   Sit outside if it is a nice day. Love this place. Every staff member is very nice & lots of smiling faces.",

Delish!  The tacos for me were just OK but the other two items were so great. I love when friends will share an entire meal!  We sat at the bar and had a 5.30 reservation, yes early but at least 6.30 at home. We took our sweet time!  So many other great things to enjoy on the menu. Service was great",

The pork belly pibil was delicious, I am a sucker for great pork belly. The pork shoulder tacos were amazing! Be sure to ask for chips and salsa! Smoky salsa was delicious!!

I settled for the guacamole made at table side and tacos. The wife had chicken and I had steak. Well, these were probably the best Tacos I've had in my life. I tried the both and both were amazing. This along with the chips and guacamole wound up to be a very delicious and filling meal. I would definitely recommend.",

Dim lighting, cool decor and casual vibe... great location with indoor and outdoor seating.  We tried: - tableside guac: delish, but we asked for hot/spicy and got medium to mild - table salsa and chips: this salsa is fire! Sooo good! - street corn and potato sides: DO NOT SKIP OVER THE SIDE DISHES! - tacos: 3 mini tacos full of flavor... we tried the steak, pork and cauliflower and couldn't decide what we liked best... all different and amazing!  I will definitely be visiting again to try some of the more unique entrees! (Don't come here if you're looking for burritos and quesadillas - you won't find it... but you will find authentic, delicious \"upscale\" Mexican delights!)",

    "text": "My dinner here was so stunningly delicious that I had to sit quietly for a few minutes after my meal and just meditate on how happy my tummy was. A friend that used to live in Scottsdale raved about this place, so I came here for dinner with my coworker on a Wednesday night.   I was a little worried about not having a reservation, but we were seated immediately on the patio (they have misters so we stayed cool even in the 100+ degree heat). The service was so prompt, which I appreciated because I was starving!  We ordered the tableside guacamole (spicy) and grilled street corn to start. They also gave us some fresh tortilla chips and hot salsa, and honestly, I could have ended the meal there and been happy. The guac is so chunky and filled with all sorts of good stuff (cheese, pumpkin seeds, onions, hot sauce). The grilled street corn is decadent; it was so creamy and had just the right amount of kick to it.  For our dinner we shared the pork shoulder tacos, which was SUCH an unexpected standout. The pork shoulder is marinated so well, and just falls apart when you cut into it. They give you mini tortillas on a Himalayan salt block that you can make your own tacos with. We had to get two orders of tortillas because it was so good!   We were stuffed by the end of the meal but this didn't stop us from getting the famed pumpkin bread pudding, which was AMAZING. It had a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top + fresh pomegranate seeds, and lots of pumpkin bread pudding sauce that wasn't overly sweet.   Best part was that the prices were SO reasonable. The bill for 2 appetizers, a giant entree, dessert, and 2 margaritas came out to around $50/person, and this was us definitively overeating.",

The ambiance, the food, the service, and everything else will gave me a very memorable experience.  First off, it's fine dining as I mentioned above, please don't expect the same meal you get at your local Mexican restaurant. I've noticed at several of these types of places the main complaint is the price, this is much higher quality!  The food is amazing, the table side guacamole is so flavorful, one of the best I've had. The pizole soup is so rich, you will want to take a pot home! For the entree, I had the jidori chicken that blew me away, super juicy, tender, and full of flavor. My wife had a pork shoulder tacos that she felt the same about. The quality of everything here is so excellent. I would consider this a must try.",

Drinks were late, plates were not cleared and overall the waiter clearly didn't care. The food was fine, but of course it was too dark to see what you were eating.

Our waiter came over and saw that I didn't touch my tacos, So she suggested the gorditas, and yuppppppp, the gordita was fantastic! I sure finished that. Haha  Drink;; I got the 360 mint lemonade,  omg. Extra friendly they made :)))",

The hostess asked if we had a reservation and we did not and she said she could seat us but we had to be gone by 6:30.  I understand her concern, but the place was 25% full, and who takes more than 1.5 hours for dinner?  We didn't start out with the best experience.  Then we ordered the fresh guacamole and it was probably the best i have ever had - i highly recommend it!  I had the Grouper which was great, but my husband had \"the chef's favorite dish to make\" the pork shoulder with chorizo and it was below average.  Dry and lacked flavor.  I had to ask for another glass of water because my glass had a huge crack down one side.  The couple next to us ordered the salmon (i think) and it smelled awful when they brought it out to the table.  Everyone in the restaurant turned to look to see what it was and my husband and i almost decided to leave, but stuck it out.  I don't think we will be back except for the guacamole maybe.  I've also heard the tacos are good, but we didn't try them.",

It would be a great place to go on a date or out to dinner for ladies night. The chips were delicious and the salsa was too, it was a chipotle salsa which is different than the normal restaurant salsa. The guacamole is made freshly in  front of you and it was fabulous. I had the shrimp tacos and was very surprised at how tastey they were. They were upscale street tacos, battered in a sweet breading topped with cabbage, a heavenly sauce, cotijo cheese, avocado and a thin red bell pepper. They are tiny, but filling. I do wish the menu had more options and some healthier items for those who are health/carb conscious. The service was great! I wouldn't call this authentic Mexican food, but it was delicious and I will be back!",

    "text": "Wow.  Once of the best dining experiences I've had in a while.  So happy I got to check this place off my list! The weather was actually tolerable out last night so we opted to eat outside, which I honestly preferred since it is so dark inside the actual restaurant.  Our server, Kate was amazing.  She was knowledgeable and quirky and gave great recommendations. To drink, my bf ordered a Negra Modelo and I ordered the watermelon basil mojito. It was delicious and also quite strong!  Maybe it was because I had skipped lunch that day but man it hit me fast!  We started with some chips and salsa and an order of grilled street corn cut off the cob.  Street corn is one of the foods that I can't resist and can be a make or break for me with Mexican restaurants.  The Mission's take on it was fantastic!  I can't emphasize enough how fresh the corn was.  So delicious!   For our entree we split the pork shoulder tacos since an order serves 2 along with a side of white bean puree per Kate's recommendation. The meal comes deconstructed with a large serving of pork shoulder, a side of red onions, cilantro, cotija cheese and a pineapple habanero glaze with 10 small tortillas served on a Himalayan salt rock.  The pork shoulder was some of the best I've had and the pineapple habanero glaze provided the perfect balance of sweet and savory.   Keep in mind when coming here that it is on the pricey side, especially compared to the portion sizes you receive.  The portions are definitely on the smaller side, but as far as quality goes, you get what you pay for.",

Now let's talk about the food. We started with the table side guacamole and crispy pork & cola lime glaze. The crispy pork was amazing. Literally one of the best dishes I've had. It is basically a lettuce wrap with pork and peanut sauce but the pork is what makes this dish so outstanding. The texture is soft but has some bite to it. It's both sweet and salty. Everyone at our table couldn't stop talking about it. It's really hard to put into words but this is a must-have when you come here.  I ordered the shaved kale salad, Almejas Al Vapor (Peruvian clam/seafood stew), and pork belly aibil. The kale salad was really good. The kale's finely chopped and the blood orange gave it a burst of sweetness. The Almejas Al Vapor was good but nothing memorable. The pork belly aibil was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor. What made this dish stand out was the skin -- really crispy and melted in my mouth.   The next time I'm in Scottsdale, I'm coming here for the pork dishes, especially the crispy pork!",

I had the torta with cheese,egg and white beans to make it vegetarian and it was moderately  flavorful. My co-diners enjoyed the chicken on a stick and skirt steak tacos and were not disappointed. The cheese plate is enough for 2 to fill up on.   Beyond the food the ambiance is very lively. The music made everyone at the table consider dancing if we had been less sober.

The restaurant is a great place for a classy birthday dinner. When we walked in the restaurant it was pretty crowded at 8pm on a Friday. There wasn't much of a waiting area and the waiting area was by the restrooms. My husband wasn't fawn of that at all.   We ordered drinks at the bar and was able to take them to the waiting area and enjoy ourselves rather than being stuck in a crowed place. Once our reservation came up we were seated on the patio. It was like a backyard setting; there were strung lights, cozy and very home feel to it. Our waiter was kind of a dick to us. We asked for sour cream and he said \"We will never serve sour cream here.\" Well hello! It's a Mexican restaurant, who doesn't serve sour cream at a Mexican restaurant!   The food was great! Although, a bit over price for Mexican food. We order their house guacamole and pork shoulder tacos. The meat was so tender it would just fall apart. I would HIGHLY recommend. The meat had a lot of flavor but that was the only favorite to the meal. My husband ordered an Old Fashion cocktail and said it was the best he ever had! He absolutely loved the bartenders for their drinks.   Overall, great place to hang out with friends, the staff could be a bit nicer (Maybe just the waiter we had) and this is not a traditional Mexican food restaurant.",

The table side guac wasnt even made table side. The tacos came out as a chunk of pork roast, not shredded, it be slow cooked for hours, it was tough. I have made more tender pork at home in the crock pot. The tortillas were served on a salt brick, which was beautiful. However the taste, made me crave the prepackaged tortillas from Fry's. Dinner for four came to over $100, and we were all less than impressed. My advice, go around the corner to Rehab burger!",

The mood inside was dark and depressing and they had too many teenagers as servers. Our waitress said the mole grilled chicken skewers were awesome, but unfortunately, they were rubbish. Cuban torta was drenched in dijon  so much that it burned my brain with the first bite. It wasn't delicious at all. Braised habanero beef torta was dry, bland and not very meaty. Tortas didn't come with sides and looked pretty sad on the plate by themselves. We are trying to erase this food memory from our brains.",

Ordered appetizers and entrees and guacamole. Guac came out right away. Appetizers did not come out for about 30-45 minutes, at the point where we had noticed the lag.  As they were coming out, manager came over without any prompting and apologized for the delay, and offered us a round of drinks or wine.  He sent over a bottle of wine which was lovely.  Food was delicious but was just generally impressed that he came over without any complaint from us and wanted to remedy the situation.  Was just generally very classy. Also, pork shoulder is delicious.",

Duck Carnitas Empanda The flavor combination worked well, but it was difficult to discern foie gras as one of the ingredients.     Pork Shoulder It was tender and flavorful with soft tortillas.  I like the presentation with the tortillas layered on top of the salt block.  I don't think the salt block did much flavor wise, and the tortillas weren't too salty because of it.

We browsed the menu while we were having cocktails, so we knew what we wanted.  I ordered the Steak Tacos ($12).  After a short wait they came out.  I took one bite and became a fan!  The quality of the ingredients was evident...the Tacos were delish.  Service was  pretty good as well.

The preparation and presentation is nothing I've ever seen as the mini tacos were stacked not stuffed.   We learned of two other restaurants the chef owns and plan on trying out!

My date and I decided to have a drink at their bar prior to dinner, the bartendress found it appropriate to wait on other patrons after collecting payment of our round which forced us to wait minutes unnecessarily. Once seated for dinner I can honestly say they I was presented with the worst short rib I have ever experienced. It was my dates order and she found it to be not worthy to eat and I quickly agreed with her. The manager, while attentive, did not agree that it was intentionally sent out unworthy of being consumed which begs the question, was the chef too incompetent to not catch that it was completely dried out and burned beyond consumption? All in all, not a good night for The Mission though I have enjoyed it many times in the past. Are they losing their swagger? Certainly seemed like they have lost their lustre though given the history I will likely give them 1 more shot at redemption. As for tonight, very disappointed ;(",

I am so very glad that I did.  I am already a huge fan of Mexican food and the place just blew me away. From the moment you enter, the atmosphere is incredible.  The walls surrounding the kitchen are made of this special salt stone that seem to be back-lit and the other decor was impressive.  The menus have real leather covers and the food sounded delicious. We ordered the corn and guacamole as our appetizers and when combined with the chips and salsa, was pure heaven.  Each had a bit of spice to it, but I was not at all uncomfortable. Each of us tried the tacos and none of us were disappointed.  The shrimp tacos were absolutely divine. For desert we tried the fried bananas and the pumpkin bread pudding and some French Press coffee with cream.  I have not had such a fully satisfying experience in a long time.  If you are looking for a wonderful and delicious experience I would definitely recommend this place.",

The hostess immediately greeted me and had my table set up and waiting.   The potato side was awesome. I would have ordered a whole side of that, if I hadn't been ordering off the Restaurant Week menu. The bread pudding and banana desserts were really good.

Should have ordered the cheese plate.  Duck Carnitas Empanada.  That shit was good!  I wanted to lick my plate, but the bourbon and tequila had not yet kicked in, so I used my finger.    Crispy Cola Pork.  Yummy.  The chiltepin made it spicy.  It was a fancy lettuce wrap, and it was delicious.    Chipotle Caesar.  A fresh break of greenery between the meat dishes.  A little heavy on the dressing.  Pork shoulder Tacos. The meat was the star.  Silly vegetarians can eat all the salad in the world, because that leaves more pork for me.  My wife and I enjoyed the roasted pork without the little tortilla, just dipping it in the mexican BBQ sauce that was served along side.  Chimmichurri Marinated Hanger Steak.  Not a lot of chimmichurri flavor here, but the tomatillo sauce on the side was super savory and yummy.  Tequila and beer and bourbon were making me tingle, so I did lick my plate when no one was looking.    Will eat here again.  A lot like Deseo in the Westin at Kierland, and also like  Barrio.  Good fancy latin cuisine.  Excellent service.  Good value for the money.  Eat here.",

But then the negatives...inside was so dark I could not see the food.  Wait staff carry flashlights so customers can see what they are eating...ridiculous.  waitress said they get complaints all night about the dim lights but the owner refuses to turn them up!!!  It is a little pricey...but ok...I'll pay because the food is really that good...but if they don't turn the lights up so I can see what I am eating then I will not be back.  There is no excuse for such a poorly lit restaurant.  Cannot read the menu, cannot see the food.  Wake up owner...whoever you are...turn the lights on please...you ruin an otherwise amazing dining experience.  ...It was so dark I could barely find the silverware...no kidding!",

    "text": "So, we didn't have a good experience the first time we tried to go, but we really wanted to give this place a second shot.  We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance to make sure that we were all set.  At first I was a little put off because when the hostess called to confirm the reservation she said that \"typically, parties of 4 take about an hour and a half to eat. Will that be enough time for you?\"  I was stunned because nobody has ever asked how long my dinner is going to take, especially when we make a reservation.  So, we showed up last night with a little bit of a chip on our shoulder about what the dining experience would be like.  It turns out that the entire evening was fantastic.  Our server, Rachel, was spectacular.  She took the time to go over the entire menu since we had never been there before.  She answered all of our questions about the dishes and made some wonderful suggestions.  Everything that we ordered was top notch!  The guacamole was probably some of the best that we have ever had.  The tostada was fantastic along with the crispy pork served in the lettuce (will definitely get that again).  The steak tacos were delicious as well.  Definitely get the street corn, it is out of this world!  We will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes (and we will definitely make a reservation in advance).  By the way, we were at our table for about 2 hours and not once did anyone come by and try to pressure us to leave.",

Sat on the patio, it was a mellow scene outside, much louder and darker inside.   Get the table side guacamole. It was one of the best guacamoles I'd ever had and watching the guac chef whip it up from his little cart was pretty fun. (Disclaimer: I am highly partial to the avocado and would probably eat them rotten.)   Steak tacos were delish. So simple - steak, avocado, lime in corn tortillas. The chicken were good but not our favorite.   Mojito was delicious although they added fizzy water which isn't my favorite.   Service was great. Would definitely return here for another night.",

I know for a fact, that the Mission claims to have some of the best Posole (or pozole, which ever you prefer) around.  Well, not anymore.  Distrito has them beat, hands down.  After tasting the pozole at Distrito, which features an unexpected garnish of littleneck clams), the pozole at The Mission seems bland and ordinary at best.    Also, after having eaten at several other upscale Mexican restaurants as of late, the food at The Mission only seems to become increasingly more over priced in comparison.  The new restaurant featuring Mayan/Aztec cuisine on Scottsdale and Thomas, Caldero, offers equally delicious food at much better prices.  Sure, the ambience isn't near as upscale or unique there, but personally, I go out to eat for a good meal, not the decoration.   If you're looking for small portions as exorbitant prices, then yes, The Mission is for you.  If not, then look else where.",

The vibe is eclectic, the lighting is soft and romantic, and the food will not disappoint! My date and I are both gluten intolerant and there were a ton of menu options for us.

My boyfriend and I shared the pork taco plate, the tacos are bite-size, never seen such small tacos. We had to order extra tacos (of course, they were not free), but the meat was just awesome.

The patio looks like a fenced in garden with plenty of shade without compromising the natural light and beauty of the area. The food was delicious and the waitstaff was attentive.

I feel like it used to be an amazing experience as my first review few years back gave it 5 stars, My guests and I left the other night very disappointed.  I reserved a table 3 weeks ago as I had friends form NYC visiting and wanted to blow them away with this place. I requested a table in the back courtyard and it was confirmed when I called after booking through Open Table. Well we arrived and we were sat inside at a horrible table right by the area the waiters had to pass and I got knocked into repeatedly by staff while walking by as well as customers going to the bathroom.  When I asked about a table outside they said no bc of a private party which maybe someone should have called to let me know. And the front patio was full. So i just lose i guess.  Second our waitress knew nothing of the menu and the items we asked questions about and then after ordering our drinks and appetizers she hadn't come back for 25 min to take our dinner order.  After asking our busboy to get her, she came over and asked if we needed anything else??? Yeah how about dinner!  Two of us ordered the flat iron steak which was good but the other two ordered the grouper fish and they were NOT good. They had fishy oder and we did not eat them.  And when the waitress came back, she dropped the check and never asked why we didn't eat the food.  We paid and left. No dessert, no goodbye. Nothing. What a disappointment.",

We decided on The Mission to celebrate his birthday based off extensive yelp searching and some recommendations from friends-- had a 730 reservation on a Saturday night. It was poppin (you definitely want a reservation). Ambiance was very lively. Room is dimly lit, making it great for a date (there was a first date going on at the table next to us), but there were plenty of groups eating together as well.   Food breakdown: -Started with the Skinny Margarita and Smokehouse Marg, both so good we ordered another round with dinner :) -appetizers: tableside guac is my favorite and The Mission didn't disappoint! Sadly due to how crowded the restaurant was, she couldn't make it at our table but was a few tables away. It was delicious, however. Then we got the skewered corn but requested it off the cob, so we could dip the chips in it and mix with the guac-- highly recommend you do the same :) (warning, there was definitely a little kick to it) -for the main course we got beer battered mahi mahi  and the barbacoa tacos. Both were great, but the mahi mahi were both of our favorites-- the breading was very light and the fish was fantastic -Dessert: our waiter Arturo was amazing and brought us a complimentary pumpkin bread pudding dessert for the birthday celebrations. Holy. Cow. I do not normally eat dessert but this was one of the top five desserts I've ever had, and the birthday boy felt the same way. The pumpkin bread pudding is served warm with cold ice cream which balances the flavors, and there's a scotch caramel esque sauce and sunflower seeds and pomegranate on top. The flavors really mixed well and i was so sad when it was over  I can't wait to come back to Scottsdale and come back to The Mission. I'd Recommend It to anyone!",

All was good. But the restaurant is so dark there is no way to read the menu without your phone flashlight which kind of distracts from the ambience. Equally hard to see your food. Chandeliers are lovely and set a nice atmosphere but turn up the lights a bit.",

We had to sit in the very dark bar because patio seating was full, definitely felt like a monastery...  The bartender was great--knowledgeable and able. The chips and salsa were the best we've had in Scottsdale--house made thin sliced chips got and salty and smoky salsa. The guacamole was fine. Good texture--not too chunky--but could have used some flavor. Dipping it in the salsa made it perfect!  The Primarita margarita was very good, but too pricey at $13, in my opinion. $13 cocktails should be reserved for higher end than margaritas.",

I opted to sit outside because the lighting and atmosphere inside was a little dark and I thought it would be difficult to read the menu.  My service was excellent! My server was upbeat and friendly. He was helpful when I had questions about the menu. There was a man filling my water glass anytime it got low. He was on it, and very friendly, too!!  I ordered the Pork Shoulder tacos- 3 smaller corn tortillas topped with a pineapple glaze. They were DELICIOUS!!! I also had the Mexican Street Corn. I had the option to have it on the cob or cut off into a bowl. I opted for the cob. It was one corn cob cut in two pieces. It was covered with a cream and spices. It was SPICY. Out of this world!!  The pricing was a little on the high side. My tacos were an appropriate $10 plate, but my side of corn was $7, for one corn on the cob. It tasted great but I would have liked to see a larger serving for that price. I could have eaten a larger serving, too!!!  I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in town from Ohio!! Highly recommended!!!",

The food was insanely delicious! We had the chicken tacos, and the steak and avocado tacos. We also started with an order of guacamole--the chips, salsa, and guacamole were all so good. The guac was topped with cheese and pepitas, and it was delicious. We seriously didn't want to stop eating; it was all so impressive.   I'd definitely recommend the Mission to anyone!",

But you get your first of three disappointments when the menu comes.  There are very few options -- six varieties of street taco, four tortas, a hot dog, and roasted chicken.  There are a number of sides and starters; perhaps you should make a meal of these??    The second disappointment is the portion size.  The guacamole, advertised by our server as \"for the table\" is about one small avocado's worth.  The tacos are tiny - a single byte of filling in each of three.  The sides are not much bigger.  The third disappointment is the price.  $12 for the guacamole, $10 for the three bytes of taco, $6 for a small portion of fries?  Really?  Mission, you are nowhere near that good.",

Unfortunately we were disappointed. The food was not good at all, and extremely over priced. $267 bill for some tacos, guacamole, a couple of plates and 4 drinks! Unbelievable! The only reason I rate this restaurant a 2 was because it had awesome ships and salsa. I give credit where credit is do. The ambiance was wonderful too. The service was great. My only complaint was the food and how over priced it was. Not to mention a very small selection of food choices. Normally I would not complaint about the price if the food can back it up! 3 adults and 3 kids with a $267 bill, crazy ... Definitely not an authentic Mexican Restaurant.",

We made reservations, for two, a week ahead of time and were only offered the time slots 5:30 or 9:00 pm. We settled for 5:30 pm. When we got there we noticed a ton of empty tables and where given a rather mediocre place near the kitchen door which all seemed a little strange. The first thing a waiter did was spill salsa all over my feet.   We ordered the Blood Orange Margarita, Caipirinha, Table Side Guac, Short Rib Tacos, Mahi Mahi Tacos and the Espresso Churros with a Chocolate Milkshake. The bill came to just under $80. Everything was good but nothing extraordinary. I'd go back one more time to try a real entree but wouldn't reorder any of these things.   A big side table show was made out of prepping the guac to justify charging $12 for it. Might be cute if you come with kids? The Espresso Churros lacked any hint of Espresso. The Mahi Mahi Tacos had breaded and deep fried tuna on it - no thanks!    Ultimately, I could have gotten all of these things at some happy hour deal on Mill for half the cost and none of the reservation hassle.",

We chose this as our only fine dining restaurant for our short trip to celebrate our two year annivesary engagement. I tried making reservations online on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> but when it was full, I called the restaurant and spoke to a nice lady who got me outdoor patio reservations at 8 p.m. on a Thursday night.   I know it's expensive, but compared to Chicago restaurants, the prices here were worth every penny, and my husband and I thought the prices were fair for the ambiance, and great service. Our waitress had too many tables in my opinion, but she gave everyone fair attention. With a large drink list, we couldn't decide what we wanted, but with some help on flavors, my husband and I got cocktails we both enjoyed along with our dinner.   We split the corn appetizer dish and the steak taco's. They are the best steak taco's I have ever had. They came in 3, all though we could have requested 4, and a generous amount was on each perfectly cooked corn tortillas. The flavor was intense, I absolutely loved it.  The presentation and taste of our banana dessert was something I don't regret eating regardless of how many calories it had and how full I was. This restaurant seemed so popular, full of people on dates, walk-ins to bar, girls night out, or just group gatherings. I would definately go back and wish the restaurant was located in Chicago.",

I tried the Aguacate (basically an avocado margarita)-it was AWESOME!! The avocado makes it very creamy, and I found it very refreshing.  I will definitely try to remake that at home during a hot summer day!",

They always do their best to accommodate us, and go above and beyond to make sure we have everything we need. I love their pork shoulder tacos, and their cola lime pork belly is the best appetizer in the world!!! Street Corn off the cob could be a meal all its own, and the chorizo Panchetta is such a delicacy. Short Rib, chicken and skirt steak tacos rival the best in town, their Creekstone filet is unbelievable. If you're feeling brave, ask for a side of their ghost pepper sauce, it'll change your life!",

Though the restaurant is very dark and the seating is very close together, the overall experience was excellent. Everything we put in our mouths succulent & fresh. The menu is varied in both selection & price. We didn't expect it to be so affordable. The food was so good that I want to go back and try other dishes! The outdoor seating looked fun for when the weather breaks a little. We've heard The Mission is Paul Goldschmidt's favorite PHX restaurant. We now know why!",

First, they have been playing this crappy game of \"we have no tables\" and then you show up and 20 mins later you're practically sitting alone in your section and it's only 7:30. What is that about? Also, the food is hit or miss. Sometimes it's amazing and other times it leaves you hanging. The pibil has been consistently good. Order that. Margaritas are solid. And something about their salsa is addictive. Beyond that, sometimes food is not paced well coming out, sometimes it's over cooked, sometimes it's under seasoned...basically eat at your own risk.",

We snagged a seat at the bar and had a glass of bubbles and a mission mule - excellent. Our wait was about 25 minutes and then we were seated in a snug spot with two tables right next to us (only con about this place). For an appetizer we got the table guac... AH-MAZING... A young man came and made it right in front of us... He even asked our preference on how we like the guac. We then got the duck entree and short rib entree - YUM! The green chili duck was the best meal I've ever had in Scottsdale and was absolutely mouth watering. Thanks Mission - I'll be back!!",

If the purpose of the \"The Mission\" was to create an experience of latin flavors that both excite and dominate your palette with brutal efficiency, they indeed deserve this 5 star review.  On a rare occasion you get to experience something new.  Both my wife and I love latin food and we had heard plenty of buzz that The Mission was the place to go to feed this hunger.  The old world style of the restaurant is matched by the decor and place settings.  You get the feeling that you are somewhere deep within Mexico or Argentina once you take your seat.  The wait staff was courteous and explained each and every aspect to the menu.  From the delectable seafood soup to the various tapas and main dishes, we were well informed on what we could expect.  We tried a little bit of everything and I cant say as I have tried anything more delectable than the south of the border treats set before us.  Each dish gave a unique experience and flavor that kept the table quiet as we tried to mastermind how to describe these tastes.    If you want an evening out that will give you no less than an amazing meal with a lot to talk about afterwords, you should make The Mission your mission.",

This is the only place that makes me miss eating chicken as the chicken taco's are so fantastic. I've been a full vegetarian for a few years now though and let me tell you, there butternut squash tacos are so delicious, so make sure to order them. My favorite thing there is the table side guacamole! I love the guys that come over and make it for you (don't forget to tip them, it's the nice thing to do) and they make some bomb guacamole. I brought my parents there and my dad typically hates guacamole but he tried the table side guac here and he ended up eating the whole bowl!   The restaurant is always busy, which is always a good sign. So, be sure to make a reservation. If you didn't make one, don't worry, just walk-in because there's usually room in the bar or somewhere on one of the two patios.",

I know it's not that kind of restaurant but being a huge craft beer fan it always bums me out when restaurants have a poor selection.

We have made this restaurant a stop because of their excellent chips and guacamole, despite the loud and crowded atmosphere - it is a scene.    Having said this, we cancelled our 6:15 reservation this year because for the second year in a row they called us to confirm our dining time (no problem there) to also tell us that there is an 8pm reservation for our table afterwards!!! This is tacky and insulting to immediately let us know BEFORE WE HAVE EVEN SET FOOT in the place  that there is a time limit on our meal; and having the pressure of knowing we better not linger already ruined our experience!  I live in San Francisco where dining out is a way of life and no establishment would ever pull this crap on their patrons - basically putting the onus on us to manage their table turnover - ridiculous!!!!  Maybe the Mission should put egg timers in the shape of avocados on each table, and when the alarm goes off, the customer has to spit out the food in his mouth and  immediately hand over his credit card and flee the premises!  There are too many really good restaurants in Scottsdale to spend my money at a place that is so arrogant and treats their customers like robots.

The tableside guacamole is chunky and spiced to your liking, and filled with flavor. You'll see that little silver cup and think it's not enough for your table, but it truly is. And the chips are divine as well. Our party of five enjoyed the tecate skirt tacos, scallop tacos, fresh halibut, butternut squash tacos, and pork shoulder.

I decided to check it out because of what the reviews said on yelp and ended up being a bit of a let down and that kind of makes me wonder if some of the Yelp reviews were done by family, employees or friends. I love to eat out and try to do so as often as I can (or cash flow allows), so me and girlfriend tried 2 apps with 2 main dishes trying to get a feel for the food and enjoy a good dinner. First, when we walk in the place it was very empty and it still took the hostess a bit long to seat us, why? I don't know. Second, we have a seat take a look at the menu and the server greets us (by the way nice server but kind of spacey) he takes are drink orders and recommends a few dishes. After a while we get our drinks but not the bottle of water that I wanted and paid for (it never got there) and the cocktails were imaginative but bland. To spare going into details the food was not bad, but just okay. After all the hype I was expecting more but honestly if I wanted great modern Mexican/Latin food I would definitely go somewhere else like - Mucho Gusto or Barrio Cafe ECT.... I think that what made me realize that I would not come back here is, when I felt the snotty and stuck up feel of this place when I responded to one of the employees about what I thought about my meal. I wasn't rude but said it was just okay but they made me feel like I was wrong for not loving it. The staff is a bit arrogant or at least similar to how this town seems to be and the prices reflect that... I am by no means cheap but $12+ drinks?, portions that don't match the prices(way over priced for what it is) call me what you like but I'll stick to great food and some what reasonable prices somewhere else. If the food were amazing the price wouldn't even be an issue i.e. Mastro's City Hall. Like I said earlier seems kind of odd that some people have given this place 5 stars when it's avrage at best. In a city were there are places that deserve high praise(4-5 stars) this is not one of them. The Mission honestly gets 2.5 to 3 stars for food, 3 for the setting (kinda cool but trying to be too trendy) but lost it when it came to the service, drinks and overall lackluster food, portions/price. I love Matt's other place Zinc Bistro but this just makes me wonder about chefs crossing over to cuisines that they enjoy eating but perhaps don't understand. I might give it another try sometime to see if it improves but I don't think I'll be back... So sad so sad, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next big thing...... Mark-",

    "text": "Sunday, February 22 was the first Pig Out at The Mission.    I found out about the event on facebook.  As my boyfriend Ben is frollicking in New Orleans for Mardi Gras I have taken full advantage to keep myself busy and get of the house.  The event started at 2 p.m. until sunset as advertised with 1/2 off Mimosas, Bloody Marys and Sangria.  $16 per person all you can eat with housemade corn torillas, chips and roasted salsas.     I ended up bumping into recently James Beard nominated Chef Kevin Binkley of Binkleys restaurat and his wife.  Chef Matt took us outside to show us \"the guest of honor\" the 50 lb pig that had been roasted since 6 a.m. that morning.  The last time I had roasted pig was at an authentic luau in Kaui in 1995.    The pig roast was absolutey what I expected which was tender and flavorful.  Matt suggested to us that the pig was \"money\" and to eat it simply with the tortillas and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.  No salsa necessary.  As always I take the chef's advice and do what I am told.  He was right.  Perfect.  It was a gorgeous afternoon on the patio and guests were seated inside as well.  Everyone was enjoying themselves.  I had one of the Mimosas made with fresh orange juice and Cava a Spanish sparkling wine.  So refreshing.  Also, had one of their best margaritas made with Partida Tequila and Agave nectar.  I especially enjoy Partida.  I met the owners daughter in Scottsdale to promote their new venture in making tequilas at an Alliance Beverage tasting a few years ago.  The family had been growing Agave for 100 years and thought it was time to start making tequilas.  Anyway, the margarita was made with fresh lime juice which I love, love, love.  Delicious.  I rarely get out to see how the rest of the world lives on Sunday afternoons because I am sleeping in after a busy weekend at Roka Akor, the restaurant I work for since it has opened.  I am glad I got my day started and enjoyed The Mission's first Pig Out.  I am sure more Pig Outs will follow.",

While the egg dish had me at \"chorizo\", I was especially pleased with the blueberry and banana pancakes with bacon and maple syrup. Perfect little candied bacon nibbles atop the fluffy deliciousness on my plate. Yum! The serving sizes were absolutely perfect as well as executed and presented well...what was not to like? In addition, I was very pleased that the music was \"tres Zinc\":  hip, fun, and played at the right volume to keep the energy flowing but not too loud so that it's intrusive.",

    "text": "Service was one of the worst I have ever had. Server obviously can not handle the size of her section plus a large party. We were charged for multiple thing we did not order and charged twice for other items. When we brought this to her attention instead of saying she would fix it she immediately stated, \"It was our fault.\" When the manager approached he was not helpful or apologetic. He stated we ordered additional items from a busboy,(which did not happen). The busboy asked if we ordered four? I very clearly stated not four, only two. When I asked why there were four? I was told they split them into four so everyone could have some. we were then charged for five and when we brought this up, the manager said,\"[He] would take care of two of them for us.\" in a condescending manner as if we had ordered them but did not want to pay for it. That still left one we did not order. Drinks took way to long to come to the table(30 mins) and were the wrong drinks twice, but we drank them anyway because we didn't want to wait longer. The wrong appetizer was also brought out, and when we told the waitress this she said,\" No, that's the one I recommended.\" we then explained that we know she recommended that one, but we said we wanted the pork belly not the cola glazed pork. She was then rude again and said that's not what we ordered. She then very rudely said we might as well keep it because she was just going to throw it out anyway we refused twice then finally said fine leave it. She never brought out the right appetizer by the way. Drinks were also charged out for $2 more per drink than the menu price indicates. When a party is spending over $600 for dinner and a mistake is made it should be fixed instead of placing blame on the guests. Spending money was never the issue.  I understand the waitress wanted to up sell in order to get a larger gratuity, but had she listened and did a better job of taking care of the table we would have spent $100's more on drinks (like we did across the street after we left). It was also odd that the gratuity that was added was not a consistent percent for each check. We all understood there would be an added gratuity for a large party, but shouldn't it be the same percent per check? We were also told when we sat down that she could not do separate checks and there would be two checks at the end which we said would be fine. Then when she tried to make separate checks (which we had already said we didn't need) she told us it was our fault because we changed seats. My reply was you told us we could not have separate checks so we did not assume we had to stay in the same seat, we all stayed at our same table so it should not have made a difference. I have eaten here multiple times and never have I had such a bad experience. If you can not handle large parties you should be up front with your guests, and we would not have made the reservation. There are many options in the area that I know can handle it. I have recommended your restaurant on a daily basis to many of my patients who live in the area. I will no longer be doing so. I accept that mistakes can be made, but may I suggest, in the future instead of having an attitude and being condescending, simply apologize and correct the mistake. I felt so bad for inviting my friends here for my birthday, that I actually refunded their money to them out of my own pocket. What used to be one of my favorite restaurants, is now a place I will never recommend again.",

    "text": "I cannot say enough good things about The Mission! It's pricy, but a MUST try.  The atmosphere is actually quite romantic and intimate- dim lighting, lots of chandeliers, ect. It's a great for a date, a special occasion or if you're looking for someplace you can dress up for.  On to the food. We ordered:  Guacamole: AMAZING. They mix it table-side so you can choose the ingredients you want included and also the spiciness. It's expensive at $12, but totally worth it  Duck Empanada: This was a meh. Difficult to cut and eat. My friend and I didn't care for this too much.   Pork Shoulder: The pork shoulder comes as a chuck of meat meant to be shared between two people. The pork is very tender and literally pulls apart. It comes with 10 small corn tortillas (they are delish!), a pineapple glaze, and some topping to make your own tacos with. I actually added the salsa that came with the chips to my tacos instead of the glaze because the glaze was too sweet for me.  Pumpkin Bread Pudding: HIGHLIGHT OF THE MEAL! Order it. Just do it. It comes out warm sitting in a deliciously salty carmel with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and pumpkin seeds for texture. Possibly the best dessert I've ever had. And I've had a lot of desserts.  Margarita: Can't remember the name of the one I got, but it's the one with 1/2 the calories. They use three limes to make it, so it still doesn't taste too strong and I liked that it wasn't as sugary and heavy as most other margaritas.   And, on top of everything, our waiter was super nice and knowledgable about the menu. Great experience!",

My husband had some mahi mahi mini tacos.. The fish was very fresh and not over fried with a nice dressing of fresh mango.  The best part of our meal was their bread pudding with a whiskey and caramel sauce that was out of this world.. I could of had a big ol' dish of that for my meal, it was that good!

The explanation was, \"we are very busy.\"  So why do I as customer have to absorb that?  If you can't handle the people STOP SEATING THEM!

    "text": "My Girlfriend had suggested this restaurant and wanted to go for her birthday.  So very glad that we did!  First the web-site.  Impressive, easy to navigate and very informative!  When you get there, you notice a very nice outside seating area.  Informal but intimate.  It is summer though, and I didn't see any misting system, so I don't know how much use this will be during the hottest months of the summer.  Once inside the doors... BEAUTIFUL! The staff is well trained and even if no one is at the hostess stand you are noticed and spoken to immediately!  The interior is beautifully appointed!  Who ever was their interior designer....rock on!  The waitress was there as soon as we were seated, was professional, made excellent recommendations and was spot on with all her knowledge in helping us with our choices. I highly recommend the pork shoulder, very tender and juicy.  The food is prepared and presented elegantly but not presumptuous.  Portions are small but the quality is high!  If you are a big eater, this is not the place for you.  If you are into food for the taste and preparation to enjoy well prepared food that has a little bit of a different twist... this IS the place for  you! My negatives, and why I can't give a full five stars is because of the seating and lighting.  Although I understand that they were trying to make the most of  space, the bulk of the tables are done in long booths with chairs on the opposite side of the table.  This means that you have tables (in most cases) immediately to the left and right of you.  While conversant with your table, you are privy to the entire conversation of the tables on either side of you and vice-versa. I find this distracting.   The mane private table requires a group of at least 6.  So, privacy is limited.  The lighting is very low, which while adding to the atmosphere, does nothing for trying to read the menu.  I would be fine with this if there was enough candle light on the table to tilt your menu to to read, but that isn't even close to adequate.  If the servers offered a pen-light, that would be the ideal. That all being said, I have no problem recommending this restaurant and will happily return. Every thing was timed well as far as when our different food items came out.  We were never rushed.  I like that!",

It's a beautiful little restaurant with an outdoor seating option as well as ample seating inside.  There are little crystal chandeliers that cast a warm glow and the wall around the kitchen is made from salt  blocks that seem to glow from the lights inside.   The food was fantastic!  We ordered the table side guacamole and the kid that made it for us had some excellent suggestions on what to order for dinner. The guac was delicious along with the homemade tortilla chips we ate it on.   We ended up going with the pork shoulder (it's for 2 people) and that was also marvelous.  The pork fell apart as soon as your fork touched it and it's served with tiny tortillas on a salt block and garnishes like sauce, cheese and diced red onion.   The only thing that didn't make this place a five star option was our actual waitress.  She  didn't seem to interested in making suggestions for dinner and didn't say a thing about the fact that I did not touch my Sophia Loren ( a really STRONG drink) I had ordered.  Also the managers were darting around but seemed to busy to talk to the patrons.  However, it would not deter us from going back there again.  It was absolutely delicious!",
