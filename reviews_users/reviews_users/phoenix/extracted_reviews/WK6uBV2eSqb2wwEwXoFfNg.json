I love how all of their ingredients are organic! Everything was so fresh tasting! I highly recommend the crispy prosciutto salad and the mushroom truffle pizza! Both were off the charts good! My son got the shrimp pizza and he said it was the best shrimp he has ever had! And let me tell you-he loves shrimp, so that is a compliment!   I have been telling everyone about this wonderful new place! So in love!",

    "text": "Incredible pizza. Ultra friendly service. A warm, inviting environment.   If you only read that far, it pretty much covers my experience at Base. We stopped in on a busy Friday night but were greeted promptly and with gusto from one of the owners who was also our server. We started out with the flatbread and house made dips. The two dips were perfectly portioned for the 8 slices of flatbread. I'm not sure what they were...besides really tasty. (The owner was incredibly busy, but I have no doubt he would have answered any questions that we had about the dish. We're just love trying new things, so we just went with it!)  The wines were written on a chalkboard on the wall. It seemed like they had a good selection, with glasses starting at $5. But we both prefer beer, so we ordered a few glasses. They were nice and cold, if slightly smaller than I would have liked for $6 a piece.  We chose the El Diablo to share. The pizza itself was a thing of beauty. A wood fired pizza can be a disaster if done incorrectly, but they certainly know what they're doing. The crust was crispy but not overly so, and spotted but not burnt. All of the ingredients were of the highest quality, which reflected in the incredible flavors. The tomato sauce was simple and fresh.  It was topped with soppressata, kalamata olives, and peppers. It was slightly spicy but might be more intense for those who aren't acclimated to spicy dishes.  It was a little more than I spend on an average Friday pizza night, but the quality is so good that I can see myself coming back for sure. Plus, Tuesday nights they have half price pizzas. In other words, I think I've found a new night to go out for pizza!",

    "text": "We decided to try Base after reading a local news piece about it. We had been to the predecessor restaurant in the space and Base initially appeared to have done very little to change the rectangular strip mall feel of the restaurant. They have however added a nice patio, and the Phoenix Fall weather was perfect for an evening outside.  We entered the restaurant and the 1st thing we noticed was the absence of a host desk, and indeed a host. The place was half full, with one large table of about a dozen people and a  couple of 4 tops occupied inside and a few tables occupied on the patio. We waited patiently for someone to notice us and after about 5 minutes, during which we thought about leaving, someone came up to us and greeted us. This laissez-faire approach was unfortunately a harbinger of the service to come.  We were seated and it took several more minutes for the table to be cleaned and menus provided. Interestingly there were zero condiments on the table. No salt, pepper, olive oil or balsamic vinegar.  The menu is small, which is probably a good idea for a new restaurant. The primary dishes are all interesting sounding pizzas, but Phoenix has a surfeit of excellent neapolitan style thin crust pizza places, so we were hoping it would be good.  We ordered a caprese salad to split while we waited for our Pizzas. The caprese took at least a half hour and during this wait nothing other than water was offered. we asked for some lemon for the water, but it never showed up. No bread either, to tide us over as they clearly struggled to serve the large party inside.  It was a pleasant evening and we had some catching up to do on the day's events so we bided our time.  The salad arrived and was delicious. I asked for a little more olive oil, but by the time it arrived we were already done.  A while later, at least 15 minutes, our waiter came by to say the pizzas were on their way out any second. It turned out that a second at Base is at least 10 minutes long. Finally the pizzas arrived. One was a classic with added fennel sausage and the other was Mediterranean inspired with olives and artichokes.  At first bite the ingredients were fresh and lovely but the crust was baked way too hard. Not burnt, but literally stiff as a board with no moisture in it. The pizza edges could be used as nails to hold down a tent. Disappointing to say the least. To their credit they recognized the disarray in their service and comped the salad but I'm not sure they are worth a repeat visit, especially with so many other good pizza places nearby. Pomo in Scottsdale comes to mind.  Prices were about what you should expect at a good pizza place but they need to figure out how to put some moisture back in their crust, and they certainly need to figure the logistics of service. A host to greet diners would also be a nice improvement",

Our waiter greeted us right away and took our drink order.  We explained that we were waiting for our daughter to arrive from work, so we weren't ready to order any food yet.  He was so nice an attentive and did not rush us at all.  By the time she did arrive (traffic) it was 6:45 and our waiter came right over to set her up with a cocktail.  We ordered salad to share and we each ordered a pizza.  My pizza was a special that evening with pepperoni,asparagus and mozzarella.  It was absolutely delicious.  Some friends then stopped by and our waiter kindly let us pull up a couple more chairs for them.  We ended up ordering more wine for the table and had a fun evening.  We will definitely be back to this fabulous pizzeria again.  Thanks Base pizza!!",

Unlike some pizzerias that leave a huge thick doughy edge with no toppings around the perimeter, Base covers the entire pizza and does not have the extra thick edge.  I liked that!  The pizza choices include classics and a few of their own, with optional add ons.  All the ingredients are organic, very fresh and delicious.  The wine list is not extensive but very good and well matched to the vibe and the food.  A full bar stands by along one side of the dining room.  When the weather cools off, the patio will be first choice, having great views of the mountain preserve.  The three Aussie owners are all fun and friendly.  Two mates and one cheeky Sheila.    We expect to become regulars at this great neighborhood spot.",

I am in town for 5 more days and I'll 100% be going back at least once more, this time with friends.

However, the gracious and discerning owner Michael adjusted the pizza and placed bacon and cheese on my husband's half, leaving my side as originally created.

    "text": "I have that pie in the sky dream. One day, after some hard work, achievement, toughness and fortitude, I'll have worked my way through all the pizza to find the one that is truly the best. Excitement built for I knew it was coming, it's so close I can taste it, base pizza was it, for sure, it had to be!  The server was super sweet, kind and friendly. She asked about our drinks and I inquired if they had any house specialties. After being informed they have a full bar and I should order anything I want, I asked if they had Luxardo cherries. With a quick yes from her, I replied, a Manhattan, Makers 46, up, with extra Luxardo cherries; Four Roses it was, as the bar doesn't stock makers 46. Looking for something interesting and different as an appetizer, we went with the pita and dip, today's dips were a sweet bean something or another, I didn't catch that one and a roasted spicy pepper hummus! This is gonna be good!   The manhattan arrived and before my first sip, I inquired about the cherries, they were not Luxardo. Not to sound pompous, but Luxardos don't have a stem so immediately I knew something was afoot. She assured me they were non gmo, organic and contained no yellow and red dye or coloring. To be honest I didn't particularly care about those qualities, that isn't really the reason I order Luxardo, you simply must try them to know, and once you do, you'll never go back. Once you've had the best, it's difficult to want something else. I soldiered forward, and the first sip was something other than delicious. In regards to the drinks at I'll leave you with, Base Pizza doesn't make their reputation on their crafty cocktails, if you know what I'm saying.  The hummus surely will perk me up, it is after all, probably one of my most favorite snacks! Tasty, but gritty is how I'd describe the hummus. A good flavor, right up there with some of the best, but I've certainly had better and a few more minutes in the food processor would not have hurt here either. It was good but I won't go out of my way for his dish again.   Along with their pizza they have a gimmicky pairing of varying spice levels of infused olive oil. I say gimmicky because the olive oils could be of much better quality and spice for the sake of spice on Italian food / pizza doesn't seem to bode well for me. They've got a ghost chile, Jalepeno, and one or two other options. It felt to me like a masking of sub par olive oil with the gimmick of spice. Many people seem to enjoy it, but I don't think I'll have much more than the first taste I took of this olive oil infusion. I'd suggest sampling the oil before applying it to your pizza and come to your own conclusion on how delicious it is or not.  The pizza was solid, tasty dough, the tomato sauce was good, the toppings were all fresh. I'd definitely have another pizza, if I lived close by. If you're here on a Tuesday, they've also got half priced pizzas. Alas, I've got more preferable pizza closer to where I live and I just can't see myself going out of the way.  Over all, I won't knock the pizza too much, everyone has their opinion on the best in town and mine is somewhere else, but theirs certainly is tasty. I don't think I'd ever order an off menu drink from their bar, and I don't feel like their hummus is worth ordering. The service was awesome, with the one snafu regarding the whole cherry thing.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!",

The pace at which the food was served made for a very relaxing and enjoyable meal. I would love to come back with my dogs and enjoy the patio again, but the interior is smartly decorated and I am sure would be just as pleasurable. My husband and I tried the Brussels and Bacon (to die for!) and a gluten free The Bosco. Apparently we like dishes that start with \"B\". We eat gluten free due to my dietary/health constraints, and I am usually just happy to be eating pizza regardless of the crust, but my husband is much pickier when it comes to gluten free crust. He LOVED this crust! To the point where he already had two slices of pizza and said he was full, but just couldn't resist eating a third. I love that everything is organic, because I live with Crohn's, I am pretty conscious about what I eat and it takes the anxiety out of dining out when you can trust the food you are eating. I could have eaten several helpings of the Brussels and Bacon and want to try to recreate this dish at home for myself. It would be the perfect accompaniment to your Thanksgiving turkey dinner, although probably better to order it to-go for a special meal than make a substandard version at home, but still it's something to aspire to.",

A couple of super friendly Aussies with a passion for \"clean eating\" own this establishment. They make creative wood-fired pizzas made from scratch using locally sourced, organic ingredients. I ordered the mixed olives to start and the Spicy Snag pizza (organic crushed tomato & chili, pork & fennel sausage, and caramelized onions - delicious!). Here are their 3 principles they live by on their website - Look after yourself, Look after the environment, Look after your community. This was a great find and a pleasant dining experience.",

    "text": "I'm all about that Base bout that Base Pizzeria that is..... I first seen this quaint establishment on Instagram,  I follow Brie Bella & Daniel Bryan from WWE.  They're locals from Scottsdale AZ and they know all the local great farm to table eateries!  So I knew this was gonna be the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!!   Top 5 reasons to give them a try   1.  Phenomenal customer service very personable and genuinely friendly to my son & myself.     2. They use as much local & organic ingredients as possible.  Farm to table is totally in ! They even have an awesome custom dining table that was made in AZ.  They carry Local wines & the EVOO they have is infused with LOCAL hot peppers as well.    3. They make the dressings & pizza sauce from scratch !   4. Cleanliness was superb, both dining area & restrooms.    5.  Pizza & Salad was delicious ! Two thumbs up The pizza was fresh made to order & the aroma was enticing !  Watching it go in the coal burning oven is mouthwatering.   I ordered the crispy prosciutto salad, it was loaded with arugula, crispy prosciutto, goat cheese & avocado it was delicious !! Very fresh and filling, enough for two ! I had most definitely had enough for lunch the next day !   The pizza we ordered was half cheese half pepperoni, just the right size !! Not to big not to small just right!!!  I believe 6 slices total. The pepperoni was big & fresh.  The texture was soft and not to chewy. It's free from preservatives so has a distinctively different taste & texture than run of the mill Pizza's.  I loved it & so did my little so , we gotta give it a solid 8!! it would have rated it a 10 but it was a tad on the soggy side. However It was bursting with such fabulous flavor that I didn't mind, maybe a little longer in the oven to get that crunch and less sogginess.  So next time I'll just ask for a little extra cook time.    Overall they rock !!! I'll totally be back & rave about them to anyone looking for a good pie in the area   Enjoy !!!",

We were immediately greeted by a hostess who offered us a few options for seating, something we appreciated.   Atmosphere (4): Very clean and inviting. I especially appreciated the open feel of the restaurant. Being able to see everything from the front door to the back was great. The place was not overly crowded but, there were not a lot of empty tables. The noise level was not too bad; we could easily hold a conversation without yelling across the table at one another.  Service (5): Service was great. Very attentive and accommodating.    Food (4): Loved the olives with bread starter. They serve local Noble Bread (Phoenix), which is the absolute best. The Amalfi Salad was great. We opted for an El Diablo and a Piggly; Mr. B. was not a fan of the Piggly. I enjoyed them both though.   Price (4): For the location and quality, the price was expected.   Overall, we would return. The environment is perfect for date night or hanging with friends.",

Very friendly and inviting staff.  We were all greeted with hellos, how are yous, and immediately seated.  We started off with some great craft beers and wines while we looked over thier creative menu.  This is where the fun begins! We started with these amazing Bacon flavored deviled eggs, with fresh parmesan and so much more....  yum Then we had a few salads and split amungst our group.  One was a pear salad with candied nuts and fresh slice pears with a lemon vinegerette and the other salad was a shrimp pesto avacado salad.  Oh my word, but it doesn't stop there.....  For our meals we enjoyed the Meat pizza and the sweat n spicy pizzas.  All fresh ingredients, wonderful tastes, on a thin crust hamd tossed dough cooked in a pizza oven.  Lastly my brother told me to try a few of thier handcrafted olive oils.  Wow are those awesome with the pizza.  The scorpion was hot,tasty and our favorite. However, my brother and I tried the smokey ghost pepper which was also excellent.  So in a nut shell you must try this place.  They are an amzaing pizza place with thier own take on food with a twist.  Keep up the great work!  Anytime we are back visiting from the Midwest / Lake Wisconsin area we will be stopping!

The crust was beyond perfection, flavorful, sweet, perfectly crisp, and just a bit moist with olive oil - almost focaccia like. The classic tomato sauce was the best I've EVER tasted - FRESH, slightly sweet, & perfectly tangy. And the pepperoni was exactly what I look for.. Plus, our server was unpretentious and warm.

The staff is always so friendly. The food - WOW. The combinations they come up with are delicious and creative. They use local vendors and really try to work in as much \"farm to table\" as they can. Definitely try the Ploughman's Platter - it's perfect to share. As for pizza, well... I actually don't eat pizza... but Base's pizza is the exception to that rule. :) Their crust isn't thick - it's the perfect ratio of crust to pizza topping, if that makes sense. You don't feel \"stuffed\" after eating a slice or two. Their wine list is awesome and the Pavlova dessert is a must (you may not want to share that one...but it's also not small, so save room if you're going at it solo). I also love the atmosphere: you can dress up for dinner if you feel compelled to do so... or, you can wear yoga pants and throw your hair up. (I speak from experience.) It's not pretentious. It's restaurant perfection.",

A family run business, consisting of a quartet of hilarious Aussies (brother and sister duo of Roscoe and Carly are most visible), the staff are friendly, funny, and genuinely passionate about their food. They take obvious pride in their locally sourced, organic ingredients and are not shy about offering a taste of this and that.  You feel as though you just stopped in to share a meal with your own family---right down to Roscoe teasing Hubs about not finishing the last bite of proscuitto, which drew quite a laugh from our table after he mowed down practically an entire cutting board of Charcuterie.  We had the Charcuterie (very impressive amount of food, bread was amazing and the meats and cheese were tasty and filling), the 'Base' pizza (picky Hubs even ate the crust, a first), and the Crispy Proscuitto Salad---deliciousness. The tomatoes used on the pizza are second to none and the brick oven adds that smoky, delicious flavor.  Tasty, fresh food, warm and welcoming staff, and easy to get in and out of this location. Superb addition to local lineup and pleased to support a True neighborhood restaurant!",

Washed down with with a delicious iced tea infusion and an Aussie Coopers larger. The friendly staff were helpful with suggestions and tasty extra options (ask about the oils). The mainly organic produce is sourced locally and all tasted wonderful. We'll be back :)",

Coming in, the staff was very inviting and helped us to a table right away. The Aussie charm, wit, and humor along with being prompt on any order we placed was a combination for incredible service. The waiter was very conversational but in the good way where it's important to connect with patrons without annoying them. Had the meat and cheese board for a starter and everything on it was extremely delicious. It came with a few pieces of this bread that had a great crunch and melted in my mouth. It was incredible. The pizzas are personal size and thin crust, which I prefer. The \"Roni\" was incredible, some of the best tasting pepperoni I've ever had. The Sauce isn't heavy and very creamy which I really enjoyed and I'm not a huge pizza/red sauce fan. Crust was nice and crunchy with a small char on it, and still soft on the inside and to me that is the perfect crust. These Aussies really know how to run a good pizza joint, and I will be certainly coming back.",

I was done with my pedi first, so I wandered over to check out our new neighborhood Pizzeria. I wasn't hungry, but good pizza is not as common as one might believe, so I was very interested in the place.   From the moment I walked through the door, I was impressed. The owners, a couple of Aussie brothers-in-law, were genuinely nice guys, and immediately made me feel welcome. I liked the place. Personable owners involved in their business are critically important to achieving success. They had that covered, hands down. But Base is a pizzeria, and the pizza had better be good. Especially since there is no pasta or wings.   I ordered a simple cheese pizza. Thumbs up! Seriously good pizza. All of it. The crust, the sauce, and the cheese. Really good. My wife wandered over when she was done with her mani, pedi, and ordered the hummus. Another hit. Very good stuff.   Base Pizzeria will be in our restaurant rotation. They are very convenient for us, I would encourage anyone to give it a try, even if it's a bit of a drive. It will be worth it.",

We particularly like the Chook pizza.The ploughman appetizer is extremely good, plenty to share with the table.  The service/staff are, as others have written, like long-time friends. It just feels great walking in to this place and be greeted so warmly.   The other night waiting for take out, we noticed they had Pimms behind the bar, so we had to try a Pimms cup. Absolutely wonderful, refreshing on a hot evening.   The owners and staff make you hope they will be a success. The quality of the restaurant and food give you confidence they will.

    "text": "We stopped by Base on a whim on a random Thursday night in 2015 and expected nothing beyond a generic pizza experience. In the end, we were pleasantly surprised and have since put Base into regular rotation when dining out.  What immediately grabbed our attention is the friendliness of the Australian staff that run Base. While servers in most restaurants seem to be running on auto-pilot, the people we spoke to were extremely pleasant and genuinely seemed very enthusiastic about the food they're providing. They focus very heavily on using local sourcing and strongly emphasizing the organic aspects of their food.  We've been here many times. We typically start with their toasted bread, which definitely doesn't disappoint. They told me their source and I forget the exact name, but they clearly chose very wisely. Additionally, they offer a meat/cheese board referred to as as the Ploughman Platter. I can confidently say that it puts practically all other charcuterie boards to complete shame!  For pizza recommendations, there's the The Base (margherita) and The Piggy, which features the ever-so-popular prosciutto and parmesan combination. We've also ordered the El Diablo, which features some spicy soppressata with olives and The Chook, which includes organic chicken thigh and potato. However, our usual orders consist of the Meaty One and the Magpie - but it's really just about personal preference. All of their pizzas use ingredients that are very high quality. I really like that they have a variety of spice-infused olive oils available at varying levels of intensity. Over time, I feel their pizza has shown some improvements in crust quality - which is probably why we keep coming back on a regular basis.  Their desserts are tricky. The ones that we loved, including an incredible banana-nutella pizza and affogato are no longer on the menu. They do have some respectable options out there, but they're a bit on the pricier side, so we only order them on occasion.   On the positive, the people are some of the nicest restaurant owners you'll encounter.  Highly recommended!",

The pizza I got was their pesto chicken, it was good, but very salty. I generally like Neapolitan pizza, so I was excited to try Base. Unfortunately, it was also pricey. I got water and a pizza and with tip I spent $25. Bottom line was that's its okay, but expensive.",

    "text": "Let me first  say, I've visited  Base several months ago, it was good. It was a rainy day and they weren't busy. My hubby loves pizza and I wanted him to experience Base. I understand it is owned by the same people that own  SMITH'S, we love it there! We tried to go today. It was about 6:30, there were a few tables not occupied, one a 6 top (I did not notice a reserved sign) and another table  that was smaller. The gentlemen walked up, didn't ask me _ I volunteered there would be only two for dinner. He said we'd \"have to wait 30 minutes or sit outside\". He wasn't really rude, he was more of a \"take it or leave it\" type tone/attitude. Didnt really seem concerned that we weren't waiting 30 minutes for pizza and we weren't going sit outside in 108 degrees. We left. I'm disappointed and to be honest, it's not WHAT he said, its HOW he said it, with really no kindness. I don't know what's up with that.  We ended up at Cherry Blossom where they were really friendly and we received excellent service",

    "text": "YUMMY!!!!  Pizza and beer isn't a normal dinner for us as we save it for very special occasions only.  Last night was reason for Pizza and Beer!   I walked in and noticed how cute the place was.  Think pizza meets pub.  The host who sat us was very friendly and laid back.  We sat at a back table near the beautiful fire they cook the pizzas in.  The smell was amazing and atmosphere was exactly what we were hoping for.    The staff was very helpful in picking out beverages.  They had a great list that paired well with all the food.    We settled on the Pear and Rocket Salad to start.  For two people it was the PERFECT size!  The candied pecans paired with the pear and shaved parm made it the perfect start to the meal.   Pizza: We picked the Sweet and Spicy Snag.  The pork and fennel sausage will NOT disappoint.  Our server also brought two different olive oils for us to put on top of the pizza or dunk the crust in. THIS WAS THE BEST PART!  You have to make sure you try them.    I will share that on any normal night this would have totally been enough food for two people.  I had skipped lunch and was still hungry.  (Trust me when I get hungry I can totally eat!)   We turned to our server to help us pick something.  We told him that we loved the red sauce and wanted something with meat on it.  He said not to worry and rushed off to surprise us with exactly what we were hoping for.  I thought it was awesome he was so confident we would like it.    He brought us the El Diablo which was OUTSTANDING!  The best part is was we had about half leftover.  When we asked for a box he shared that the following morning we should heat the oven until 385 and crack an egg on the top of the pizza and have it as breakfast pizza.  We did JUST THAT and loved it!",

We started with the Pear and Rockets salad (Arugula, pears, local nuts, etc.) - it was really nice.  Ordered a couple of their wood fired pizzas - mine was the Spicy Snag (homemade sausage, carmelized onions...good stuff!) - crust was very good - nice char, leopard spots on the bottom, no flour or cornmeal, and most importantly, very tasty.  Sauce was very nice as well.  After saving room for dessert (and boxing up leftover pizza and salad for lunch for later), we split the banana bread dessert - two pieces of scrumptious banana bread with two small scoops of local berry ice cream - not too big - just the right amount to top off a lovely evening.  Give this place a go!",

Atmosphere:  Clean and stylish, indoor/outdoor seating, full bar.  4 stars  Service:  Prompt and attentive, there were a handful of diners but they weren't what I would consider busy last night.   4 stars  Appetizer:  We had the Toasted AZ Bread, which is drizzled in EVOO.  It was very simple but good.  $3  -  4 stars  Pizza:  I ordered \"The Roni\" + mushrooms. It looked amazing, but this pizza was not my favorite, for lack of a better word it tasted wet or watery.  The crust on the outside was crispy but the crust under the pizza was soggy.  I don't mind greasy pizza, like a great NYC slice that you must fold in half, but this wasn't grease.    On top of that the pepperoni was sliced with some of the casing left on it, so there were thin strings of casing I had to pull out of my mouth with each bite, I don't think thing they leave this on intentionally and if so I didn't enjoy it, imagine chewing on bits of dental floss.   It had the potential to be really great, but fell short.  My boyfriend got the Margherita and he said I got the bad piece but it was soggy too.  Sadly only 2 stars on the pizza.   I wanted to give this place four stars, but I can't when the pizza experience wasn't good and its a pizzeria. I've had worse but I wouldn't go back on my own.  I am an equal opportunity pizza eater....NY, Chicago, delivery, Degornio, I don't discriminate but it just wasn't all about the Base for me last night...",

I guess that could be harsh but it's a shame if that is his real personality. The pizza ? The cheese fell off in one bite (usually a sign of cheap cheese ) and the sauce was so sweet it was as if sugar was added to it , like a lot of sugar. The saving grace was the crust and the price for what we got . Probably the not be returning.",

The place was emptier than it should have been at lunch on a Friday, nearly all of us opted to sit on the patio facing Lincoln and Squaw Peak. Given how crowded and noisy many area places are at lunch, maybe that's a good thing but based on my experience they deserve to be busier. I never went inside as my guest was on the Patio when I arrived but the interior looked clean and modern from outside. Server was friendly and informative and we went with his recommendations on a special pizza and the appetizer of the day which was roasted purple cauliflower steak or heads, with a light cream sauce and crushed nuts. Both were delicious and came out very fast. They have a large selection of wines and a full bar as well. I'll be back!",

I would say it's the best experience I've ever had with a waiter/waitress. The pizza, the bread, The salad, everything... Is among the best food in the state of Arizona. It was just a great evening, what else can I say. It is worth your time to at least go check it out. As a lover of Joe's pizza in the village in New York city, this is just about as close as I could find in the valley that I has that same kind of magic, although the two types of pizza are a little different for sure, but both make me very happy.",

It's got great views of Squaw Peak, being as its foreground view is the parking lot.. But no matter.  This space was formerly rented by a fellow named Danny who lacked the warmth and personality of a great restauranteur.    The current owners are an Australian  couple and her brother and they couldn't have been friendlier or nicer or more accommodating.   They allow well behaved dogs on their patio which is always a plus for us!    The only reason for four stars instead of five is that the pizza after slice number two got to be pretty pretty pretty dry.    But ...we will definitely return!",

This restaurant was a nice relief when I walked up and found a cool, relaxing, friendly and yet classy pizza restaurant in the plaza of 32nd St and Lincoln. The service and the food equal out - impeccable!   Hubby ordered a beer, we ordered the bruschetta, the meaty one pizza (gluten free) and the tiramisu. I liked the bruschetta. We haven't found a good gluten free pizza in a long time until the night we dined here. Although I did think the pizza was a little small, it was delicious and we wished we had more!   For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu with the recommendation of an employee and when we received it, it was bigger than what we anticipated. It was delectable and I loved every bite. I highly recommend ordering the tiramisu if you visit. Since it was so big, we had leftovers and took it home. We ate it the next day and it was still just as good as the other night.   Price is a little higher than other pizza joints around the valley, but I enjoyed the dining experience. Total of our bill: $53. Overall, this restaurant is a great addition to the valley and we will definitely be back!",

And with the first group of friends walked in, she forgot my order.  I was trying to wave her down.  So I figure I will just order with the 2nd wave of friends.  I did and of course my order came out last.  But we did place an order in for more pita bread for our humus.  That took forever to get out.  I believe it is the size of our group (14) plus the place was busy.    The humus and pita bread was great!  The base pizza with prosciutto was delicious.

I've been meaning to do a review on this place because of how exceptional it is, in all manners; from the restauranteurs, the atmosphere, scenery, the price, the quality of food, and the impeccable customer service, you get the point. No matter the occasion, this place has always been on point, we've had pre deployment dinners there, birthday dinners, graduation lunches etc. Who would've thought that an Australian couple could make the best pizza in the Valley.",

After descending Camelback today around 4pm, we decided on pizza.  Base Pizzeria stands out because they hold a solid 5 STAR RATING!!!  After getting the full experience, I now understand why.  It's in a strip mall, so I wasnt thinking much as I walked into what turned out to be a pretty fancy dining room, especially for a pizza place.  White linen tablecloths with crystal clear wine glasses ready for the filling.  Some people know I'm a sucker for an Aussie accent, and they had me at Hello... literally... by the voice on the other end, when I called up to see if they were open on Christmas Eve.  The same charming wonder from down under, led us to our table and offered up some recommendations.  Breaking tradition, I ordered a Cooper's Pale Ale from the Motherland, or is it Fatherland? ...Underland???  Anyways, it was a perfect unfiltered beer with a refreshing taste, to this trail weary hiker.  I went with the meaty pizza, while Yuko chose the Mediterranean.  We made a secret pact to share slices... which turned out to only be one slice after she announced that her's was better.  Okay, I guess I'll just hold the monopoly on pizzas with fennel seeds.  The bottom line is:  COME HERE!  It's close to Camelback, and closer to Squaw Peak (Piestewa).  Take a train, trolley, cab, Uber, Lyft, hang glider, pogo stick... whatever.  Just come here.  The owners are super personable, really upbeat with a great energy, and just plain happy to have you there.  I recorded a 43 second video with the owner, that Yelp isnt allowing me to upload.  Dont make me send Crocodile Dundee up there to handle things.  Get your tech together, Yelp!",

This place came up on Yelp search and didn't even know it was here although I drove by everytime I go hiking to the piestewa peak.  This place is only 11 mins drive from the Camelback mountain, makes a perfect stop after hiking.  As soon as I walked in, a nice lady with Australian accent welcomed me. I really like the decor of the restaurant, very inviting. I saw the wine list and really wanted to order a glass of wine. Their ambiance is perfect to enjoy a glass of wine or beer. If I didn't have to work later, I would definitely have ordered one.  Perhaps next time..  I ordered the Mediterranean pizza. Pizza came with tomato, mushroom, artichoke, olives and Parmesan. All my favorite pizza ingredients.  Their olives tasted like home made olives.   Server spoke with Australian accent too but I think he was just playing along. Great service nonetheless. I liked the bathroom decoration too. Lot of thoughtfulness throughout.  I can't wait to come back and try some other pizza and other dish on the menu (with a glass of wine).",

The same man was also our server and went above and beyond the entire evening to take care of us.   We were there on a Tuesday night which happened to be half price pizza night. Nice surprise!   To start, we ordered the meat and cheese board, called the Ploughman Platter. It was huge and absolutely delicious. Nice selection of meats, cheeses, fruit, nuts, olives, hummus and bread.   For the main course we of course ordered pizzas. We shared two, the El Diablo and the Spicy Snag. El Diablo was a soppressata and kalamata olive pizza. Spicy Snag is a sausage and caramelized onion pizza. Both were very good but the Spicy Snag won between the two. Pizzas are big enough to share but we each polished one off.   We were too stuffed for dessert, but they had some great looking treats available. I'll have to try one next time.   Be sure to check this place out. Support those local businesses! I can't express enough how great the service was.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "My expectations were pretty low when my friend suggested we meet at Base for dinner.  I am not a huge pizza fan.  I may have been converted.    We ordered the capressi appetizer.   Wonderful tomatoes, fresh mix and herbs...wonderful.  My friend, confused by my enthusiasm for the dish as I normally pick tomato out of my food, laughed as I explained, \"No, these are REAL tomatoes!\"   I wanted bread to soak up the remains of the balsamic and oil.  The pizza crust sufficed.   The pizza special was equally wonderful.  Even my picky \"avoid weird food\" friend thought the pear, bacon and cheese combo topped with arugula was spot on.  So good.  Glad I kept my app plate to soak the \"pizza bones\" -- no crumb left behind.    Service was pretty great but for one little etiquette tip...okay, a health tip.  When cleaning up a small beverage spill, wipe the table before you wipe the floor.  That could have freaked out someone else, but there was no food on the table and I don't think we realized how much actually spilled.  Her intent was to wipe off the table only, until I pointed out the spill on the floor.  Tip from a former server: Coffee presses (And some carafes) are a notoriously leaky pour, don't rush it.   It was surprisingly quiet in the restaurant for a Friday night, but there was steady take out traffic.  Hopefully, they have enough loyal customers to sustain in restaurant saturated Phoenix.    All in all, a great experience.",

The location of this pizzeria is facing Piestewa Peak, amazing view and, the decor is subtle yet hipster posh.  The wine selection is extensive, carrying excellent American wines, especially reds. We ordered quite a few pizzas: the meaty one, the chicken pesto, the sweet and spicy, and pizza of the day, which consisted of arugula, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, red onions, and their sauce. Personally, my favorite pizza was the meaty one, but I enjoyed all the other pizza. It was good, but it was missing that \"umph!\". The only off-set was that the crust got chewy and hard if you did not eat the pizza quickly, but their toppings were fresh and delicious. I did LOVE how they bring spicy olive oils to accompany your crust. Lastly, the service is excellent; we had a very attentive waiter.",

We were told we could have a table by the hostess, as there were 5 open ones, and only one with a reservation sign on it. Instead, the owner walked over and told us we could only have the bench seating that was jammed next to the wall. Hardly enough room to fit between the table next to it. We told him the girl said we could have one of the tables and he immediately said that he had just had a reservation for it, and every table was spoken for. Really? At 7:00 on a Tuesday? Funny, he never even recognized us as regular customers who rooted him on when he started. So, with that, we left and walked to the other end of the shopping center and went to Amore. It was superb!! When we finished, we walked back to where our car was parked, and sure enough, all the tables that were supposedly reserved were still unused, and the place was empty. I guess the owner was counting on making people that might show up, happier than the ones that actually took the time to come in. With so many good places in town, we will not be back.",

    "text": "Last night, we took the kids to Base Pizzeria to check it out - after all, in a city that TripAdvisor deems one of the top 10 pizza cities in the country, we've gotta check out a new place that opens right down the street from our house. Walked in and at first glance, it didn't seem too child-friendly - there were no booths where we could pen in the kids and the bar was rightthere. But once we were seated at a table near the pizza oven, it was immediately apparent that the staff and ownership were not only exceedingly friendly, but exceedingly child-friendly. Each table was covered with brown construction paper and the kids had plenty of crayons and could write wherever they wanted on the table. Our waiter (brother of the owner, who also came by several times) mingled with the kids and played along with Kalen's chit-chattiness. The pizza station was separated by clear glass, allowing the kids to watch the pizza making and cooking. And when their pizza came, the kids actually ate it (they are notoriously difficult when it comes to actually eating their own food), which is a great testament to the pizza.  Only once did Cora have a mini-meltdown when she declared ownership over all of Kalen's crayons, but I took her outside for a few minutes (as I've done countless times over the last year) and she understood exactly what she had done wrong. She walked back in and gave Kalen a hug and shared the crayons nicely.   When I walked back in with Cora, the patrons all gave me a knowing smile and it became really evident to me and Gina that the staff's attitudes toward children had influenced the rest of the diners. It's amazing how much staff understanding of the situation and doing the right thing results in an infinitely better dining experience.  Oh, and our pizza. It was really good. Crust had the right combination of crispy and chewiness. The tomato sauce was just the right tanginess.   I highly recommend Base - While Parlour, Pomo, and Bianco have attained superstardom, Base can't be too far behind.",

I was a bit skeptical of strip mall pizza, but after seeing the reviews and hearing my stomach, we decided to give it a shot.  We split the dips/flatbread as well as the Piggy pizza. Dips included a hummus and a baba ganoush. Pizza was European style with arugula leaves, cheese and prosciutto  added after it was cooked. It was the perfect amount of food to split for a late lunch and everything was delish. My husband loved the hot pepper infused olive oils, especially the ghost pepper (he's been inspired to infuse his own at home)!  Even better than the food was the service and the atmosphere. While we sat out on the patio the staff was attentive and engaging to all of the customers, of which many I could tell were regulars they recognized by name. We will definitely return the next time we are in Phoenix!",

    "text": "My husband and I went here because we were craving some gourmet pizza, a trendy spot for a casual date night. And organic? Total win. Wrong. I will say the service was great. Michelle was wonderful. The food - very mediocre. The bruschetta was bland and the bread was SO SOGGY. the two pizzas we got were also bland. I didn't like that the pizza was SO THIN and again soggy but the crust was completely black and I couldn't eat it when that is my favorite part. We got a Roni and he got the special which was this potato and bacon mixture. My husband had three sodas and weird- they charge for each soda. Not to mention they were kiddie size. It was also insanely loud. We will not be back and threw out our pizza. I think the two stars is for service and it was cute inside. Here is a tip- want good pizza with great environment, amazing menu and amazing service try parlor down the street!",

    "text": "We tried Base after a recommendation from a local while at a brewery. I have a couple of complaints about this place but let me start by saying all of our food was delicious, The service was good, and we got our pizza half off for being there on a Tuesday!   Now, my beef with the place is that it has a very pretentious feel to it. It's unfair to knock the restaurant too much for that because honestly i feel like it was more the patrons than anything about the restaurant.  We did get a slightly condescending attitude when the hostesses found out we didn't have a reservation despite the restaurant was half empty when we got there but once we sat our service was nothing but great! My wife and i came in work out clothes because we were in Arizona for a hiking trip and didn't bring anything else and we got several unnecessary stare downs.   But regardless...go for the pizza and you won't be disappointed!",

Have to say that the recommendation from Michael of the El Diablo was spot on!  Everything was wonderful but the El Diablo tipped me over.  I was happy to see my favorite hard cider, Samuel Smith, on the menu.  But again Michael directed me toward the Aspall, another great English cider.  I believe I have a new favorite!!!  Well done to this family business!  As one family owned business owner to another...I can't wait to come back again!!!",

Michael seated us right away and got us set up with cold water and menus. He was very kind and attentive. We ordered the Sweet & Spicy Snag and The Meaty One, both well-done (crispy).   The Sweet & Spicy was really a fun pie. The sausage was crispy and delicious, and the sweet onions gave it a real pop of flavor. Fresh chopped jalapenos were just a pinch of spice and earthiness. The Meaty One was all you need in a meat pizza, and I really loved how fresh the crushed tomato was in each slice!   Along side our pizza were infused olive oils or us to try. One was described as 7/10, and one 10/10 on a spicy scale. Neither were melt-your-face-off hot, but both had great heat and pronounced flavor.   The restaurant is comfortable and inviting, and all the waitstaff seemed to be friendly and liked working with each other - I love seeing this in a restaurant!   All in all, a great stop. We will be back. Thanks again, Michael!",

    "text": "Spring weekends in the valley are made to take advantage of outdoor spaces before the heat rises and it becomes almost impossible to do so. Base Pizza is the perfect place if you want to be out in the air without exerting too much energy. The patio has the perfect vantage point with a straight viewing shot to the mountains. But, to add to the great patio, the menu is awesome too. Just the appetizer menu blew my mind! Weekends are also made for splurges like pizza... oh and wine! Well, for me they are! My fellow Yelpers did not do me or Base Pizza wrong with the star rating of almost five when I was here yesterday. It's truly that: a five, but really.. it' a perfect ten. We were met by the lovely, gracious, smiling Megan on this particular Saturday afternoon moving to evening. We had a choice of most the tables on the patio and it was perfect with the sun setting over the mountain. A recommendation off what we liked in vino and with Megan's expert opinion, we chose a Loire Valley bottle of Les Boursicottes Sancerre; a crisp white wine that was much like a light sauvignon blanc and perfect for this mid heated day. There is quite a list of beers here and wines have a proper selection, as well. We decided to enjoy our nice bottle and order the Ploughman's Board. Megan recommended this too.. as we said how much we loved trying different charcuterie boards in the valley and how much they vary in amount and cost. This girl knows this menu and engages her customers! This board blew our mind when it arrived! It was more of a smorgasbord platter of things from the starter menu! Olives; a bit of Caprese ; Garlic Crema ( TO die FOR!); a super creamy chunk o' Brie ; a hard fontina type cheese ( generous portions, mind you); Prosciutto; Soppressetto Salami ; a Basil Pesto dip; Pear slices with Cranberry Chutney ; strawberries; marinated artichoke hearts; Brussels and crisp bacon, soooooo good!, and garlic toasted Noble Bread .. ALL this ** $20! It's a meal in itself and the MOST amazing charcuterie board I've EVER had in AZ and maybe all over this past year! The whole thing was great and we took some of it home. We were so full of wine and this massive board we decided to order a pizza to go, as that was the main reason for coming to Base Pizza and we got sidetracked, as we often do! We decided that The Bossco was the choice to take for this day. Base Pizza pies are in average about 11-12 inches in diameter. The Bossco came with organic fresh tomatoes; pepperoni; fresh fennel and sage sausage; charred sweet onions; wood fired peppers ; olives ; and fresh parmigiana and fior de latte. This pizza was enough , with leftovers, for two. It was still fresh and so tasty when we got it home. I truly love great pizza. Base Pizza not only was great pizza, it's a great place to hang out.. catch a sunset over the mountains .. or take in the vibe at the cool bar inside. The wines and beers were on point.. service could not have been better .. the menu is supreme. I love that we are so lucky with our local foodie scene here in the valley .. add Base Pizza to the list , because it's all things local and awesome!",

    "text": "Riddle me this.  What if someone told you some of the best pizza in town was near the Biltmore.  So far so good?  Next you find out its made Neapolitan style.  Sounds like a winner.  Now what if I told you the restaurant was run by a trio of Aussie ex-pats?  Your reaction to this revelation would probably consist of (1) Huh?, (2) What?, or (3) WTF?  Welp, meet the trio.  Rossco Lukje, Rossco's sister Carlee Lukje, and Carlee's husband Michael Sands.  Years of experience between the three of them (and Rossco finding his future bride on a chance visit to Phoenix) led this trio to take a shot at opening a neapolitan pizzeria and wine bar just a stones throw from the Biltmore neighborhood.  The Phoenix area has no shortage of great neapolitan pizzerias (hell Downtown Phoenix alone has four world class ones), but as I write this Base carries the distinction of highest rated Phoenix pizzeria on Yelp.  For dinner on Sunday, I brought my Dad along with me to see what these renegade Aussies were up to.  You'll find Base on the southwest corner of 32nd Street and Lincoln (just east of the Coldwell Banker office in back).  While the shopping center itself isn't much to look at from the street, Base has occupied a spot that provides a beautiful view of the nearby Phoenix Mountain Preserve.  Its particularly gorgeous to look north toward the preserve at sunset (hot tip for all you guys looking for a dinner date idea).  There's seating both inside and out (I'd guess seating for about 60 or so in all) and a decor that is both casual and classy.  The menu at Base is a balance between True Italian classics as well as some in house inventions and improvisations that Rossco comes up with.  In fact they have a special pizza almost on a regular basis.  Tonight my Dad and I stuck largely to the menu in front of us.  I love a good meaty pie so I ordered the Meaty One.  Tomato sauce, pepperoni, soppressata, pork and fennel sausage, and Fior De Latte cheese.  My Dad ordered the Pesto Chicken.  Housemade cilantro pesto sauce, sliced organic free range chicken, cherry tomatoes, sunflower seeds, and Fior de Latte cheese.  In addition to wines, they have a fairly impressive beer selection including a number of microbrews from Australia if you're game.  I stuck with local and went with a Lumberyard Lager.  In about 5 minutes after ordering, our pizzas arrived at our table hot out of the oven.  The pizzas were phenomenal.  The meats on the Meaty One were juicy and delicious, with each offering its own textural note and spice level.  I also really loved the pesto sauce they used on the Pesto Chicken and the chicken had an almost buttery texture even while it was fully cooked (those lean free range chickens must make all the difference).  The crust was also cooked perfectly with a nice soft interior and great crunch on the exterior.  One characteristic I will say that stands out about Base relative to other neapolitan pizzerias I've tried is the crust tastes a little grainier.  I'm not sure what to attribute this to, but maybe they're using a little more wheat flour?  Just a guess.  No complaints either way.  The dessert menu is a rotating one so I asked what was available.  One of the items they were serving tonight an Australian dish called a Pavlola.  I had zero idea what this was but it was depicted to me as a meringue layer cake.  Sounds good to me.  My Dad warned me in advance that he wasn't going to help me with dessert.  Turns out I needed his help more than I knew.  This cake slice was literally the equivalent of a size 8 shoe.  The waiter profusely assured me it wasn't as intimidating as it looked, but I was legit scared.  The cake was indeed super light and airy and the berry compote that came with it was excellent, but despite my best efforts, I took a lot of it home.    Total cost for my share including the beer, Meaty One pizza, Pavlova dessert, tax, and tip came to about $35.  I really love Base's fearlessness in terms of mixing tradition with locally and organically sourced ingredients and even some non-Italian influences.  The views from this pizzeria are hard to beat and the staff was super enthusiastic during our entire visit.  So apparently Aussies know their neapolitan pizzas too, and it just so happens that three of them decided Phoenix was the perfect place to open one.  Lucky us.",

Everything about this place is on point.  From the service to the food, I couldn't find a flaw anywhere.    To start, service was just outstanding.  Our server was one of the owners, Roscoe, and he was super friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about their food.  He described all their specials of the day (quick note: all food is sourced our local farms) and we had to try their specialty pizza of the day (roasted corn sauce with sausage and aoili on top).  The crust on this pizza is heavenly, and every bite was worth mile I had to run the next day to burn off the calories.    The atmosphere itself is relaxed, casual and homey.  We sat outside, and they have blankets set up at every table in case you get a case of the chills.  Luckily for us, it was perfect outside, so the blanket wasn't needed, but it's a lovely extra touch that shows you that they care about their customers.  If you're looking for fresh comfort food with lovely people, I 100% recommend checking out Base Pizzeria!!",

    "text": "I am writing the review based on a customer service issue, not the food.  I visited Base with a group of 7-8 friends. I ordered $18 in food, a $52 bottle of wine for the table and my boyfriend got a $16 tequila.  Since I was only staying for a short time, I asked for a separate bill.  I paid the bill and left.   60 days later I was entering receipts into Quickbooks and noticed that a 20% \"service fee\" was added to the bill.  However, the waiter never told me this so, I tipped an extra 22% on top of the total, which already included the 20% fee.  To put this in dollar and cents....  $86 - bill $7.14 - tax $17.20 - 20% service charge added by waiter  $25 - tip from me  So, this waiter received $42.20 in tip on a $86 bill ($52 of which was a bottle of wine). Nice tip!  Here is the real complaint.... I called the manager and informed her of the issue.  After speaking to the server, the manager called me back.  She told me the waiter recalled the group but didn't recall if he told me specifically that the service fee was already added.  She stated it was however printed on the bill.  The manager asked me what I wanted to resolve the issue. I told her I'd like the $25 back. She then told me she'd like to resolve the issue by me coming in and getting the money directly from the server!!!  I actually laughed and told her that I wasn't going to come in and collect the money directly from the server.  The manager then told me they are a small family business and since it was tip money that the business didn't receive, she wasn't going to take it out of their own pocket.    At that point I told the manager to forget it and to please inform her servers to tell customers when gratuity is added.  I also told her that although I live in the neighborhood and dine out daily, I would never be back to Base.   What an awful way to handle this matter!  We shall see how long this place lasts!",

Be sure to try the delish PLOUGHMAN PLATTER to start with your wine. The Wine selection is fab. Ross is the sommelier that is super energized at guiding you to your perfect choice for dinner.   All the owners are going to make your visit a pleasure.  Just their personality will turn your bad day around. Great non alcoholic drinks to choose as well.  Ask about the Passport coffees and teas. When you're there, say \"Hi\" to Jake in the kitchen (formerly of Hava Java) showing off his culinary skills.",

In the past we have gone back to the same little place in Old Town until the food and service took a HUGE nose dive so off to a new spot we went! I pass Base Pizzeria every day on my way to work so I looked it up and loved that it is locally sourced and organic food! We made a reservation for 7pm and was seated right away. The restaurant is not huge but they have a nice patio, little bar and tables inside and you can see them making the pizza's right there in the corner next to the bar. So cute! Every Tuesday they do 1/2 off pizza's and kept the special even on Valentine's Day! They had some specials on the chalk board on the wall when you walk in and also had posted them on their Instagram page and man did they look delicious! We each ordered a pizza, my boyfriend had the Base (traditional margarita type pizza) and I had The Magpie. I LOVED my pizza and so did my boyfriend. The service was great as well! I cannot wait to make this our little pizza spot!",

Had the white truffle with soppressata and my only regret was that I didn't eat slower to make every bite last longer. Pizza comes out fast (800 degree wood oven), staff is kind and attentive, and the ambiance is cool. This place is a gem and it's going to be one of my first stops next time I'm in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Wow. Wow!  So I live in Arcadia and Base has been on the brain for a while -- also my girlfriend is a huge foodie so we tend to eat out at tasty places. Anyway we were at the bar in Windsor and happened to be sitting next to a guy who was the pizza chef at Base -- awesome guy and super chill. He was a huge fan of what they were doing at Base and really passionate about the pizza. Totally crazy how everyone in the food & bev industry knows each other but whatever it's life.  Anyway we were at Base last weekend for lunch and both the service and food were IMPECCABLE. My girlfriend is more of a stickler for food while I'm more of a service guy -- IMO if you're not having a good time then you might as well stay home and enjoy your own amazing company you know? Either way both of us left super happy.  Re: the food -- we got two pizzas (the meaty one and the spicy snag), a modified beet salad, finished with a tiramisu dessert, all were amazing. The pizzas tasted completely different as well, the spicy snag was lighter and the meaty one was obviously meaty, both were delicious and all the toppings (and tomato sauce) were FRESH. The tiramisu was absolutely wonderful too, not too sweet and texture was perfect. As an aside, their goat cheese was DELICIOUS, if you're a fan YOU MUST TRY SOME.  Re: the service -- most important for me is that our server Roscoe gets it -- we wanted to take our time so he didn't rush us, but he popped in appropriately from time to time to check in. Also (and this is a big deal for me), he explained the food perfectly and could say where all the ingredients were sourced from -- we're both health conscious and most of the stuff was organic (my girlfriend does crossfit and recognized the specific farms the food comes from). Roscoe's obviously passionate about what they're doing and it shows.  We will be back and I'll most likely become a regular. These guys get it.",

The sausage was very good, the pepperoni wasn't your usual pep it was large and  perfectly cooked, and the carmalized onions had great moisture. The crust was soft but a little crunchy. After all of that we had fresh strawberry reduction sauce over organic vanilla ice cream. The sauce made it. It was very refreshing and satisfying. The best part of it was the service. This is a family owned restaurant. The owners are a couple and a brother. They are very kind and generous. They let us try their homemade olive oils-ghost and carolina reaper. Overall this was a great restaurant with great food and service.",

We waited so long for our food, water and drinks and then our table was never cleared so we sat with a full table of dirty dishes. Three pizzas, two salads and a couple drinks totaled $230 which included gratuity. Expensive, poor quality pizza and terrible service means we won't be back.

Averaging from $13 to $20 per pizza. I'm in love with this pizza! (I'll get to dessert in a minute!)  I just seen on their website, they offer pizza and wine class, offering instructions on how to make that perfect pie, and taste wine, and appetizers! $75 per person, for a couple hours! Perfect date night! They also have a kids version for $45, fun Birthday occasion as well!   Just finished up our left over pizza for breakfast! 2 days later, and it was still amazing! We ordered the Roni, and the Bossco!  Both were so good! Looking forward in trying more menu items!   TUESDAY, dine in special, all pizzas are 1/2 price!   Located in a strip mall, in Paradise Valley. They offer a little patio for outdoor dining with your fur babies, or your non fur babies!   Now for desserts... oh my GOSH! Seriously the highlight, if that's even possible, \"to our shine that amazing pizza!\" The dessert chef, changes the desserts often, but this evening, we had a meringue, with light a fluffy cake, topped with a super delightful cream! I can't even describe this dessert appropriately, it was simply heavenly!",

Base was the location of choice for a recent girls' night dinner, and it did not disappoint.  There were four of us and we shared brussels sprouts, 3 pizzas (a pepperoni and mushroom, a veggie, and a sweet and spicy), 2 salads (an amalfi and a pear & rocket), and a pavlova dessert amongst us.  We had a glass of wine (or maybe two) each as well.   It was hard to choose a favorite between the pizzas - all were delicious.  If you're feeling adventurous, ask for a side of honey for your pizza or some flavored olive oil for your food.  The salads were large, fresh, and super tasty as well.  And the pavlova... it may just be one of my all time favorite desserts!   Lucky for my husband, we had leftovers ;)  Service at Base is top notch - we had super friendly and attentive service from Michael at our recent girls' dinner.  Love the Australian accents too.  We were there on a Tuesday and didn't know when we planned our night, but Tuesdays after 3 are half off regular menu pizzas for dine in customers.  Even with that discount, be warned - your bill will add up quickly.  Torn on a 4 or 5 star review here, but feeling generous on this one because of my recent fun and delicious dinner, so I'm rounding up.  Hope to return soon to try more of the menu, perhaps with the husband or kids!",

Something I thought was nice is that since the whole front of the restaurant is glass, so you get a beautiful view of the mountains no matter where you're sitting    We split the Ploughman's Platter and The Bossco Pizza.  I love rare meats and cheeses and The Ploughman's was probably one of the best charcuterie boards I've ever had.  It was HUGE and well worth the price with a great selection of meats, cheeses and accouterments.  Highly recommend.    The Bossco Pizza was also great.  I don't know what made them think of \"pepperoni cups\", but it was a pretty solid idea.  Seriously, they're shaped like little cups, and they take up less surface area on the pizza.  So, like, there's more pepperoni fit into the same space.  More pepperoni = more awesome!  This and the pizza's other ingredients - organic crushed tomato, pork & fennel sausage, wood-fired peppers, charred onion, kalamata olives, fior di latte and oregano - just really made for a delightful pizza with a nicely finished crust.      Our service was also impeccable.   I wish I could remember our server's name as well as I remember the food because she was awesome.  Super friendly, super attentive and she had great recommendations.    Great pizza in a beautiful part of town.",

The mixed side salad, probably from a bag, had a Balsamic and oil dressing that was well balanced. At $6, and large enough to split between two people, a reasonable price. The mixed berry cobbler and ice cream, more than $10, was not seasoned appropriately- something a bit wrong that detracted from the berry flavor.  This restaurant is next door to a nail salon, so that's the first smell you notice but you have to eat outside if possible because it's noisy inside.  It is a beautiful location.",

After dinner we enjoyed a tasty dessert. Base Pizzeria makes their own Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  It was so tasty, we bought a bottle to take home.",

The oven is the centerpiece of this restaurant and you can watch them make and bake the pizzas fresh.   The bartenders are always incredible. My wife and I always ask the bartenders to make improvised drinks. We tell them the liquors we like and we get something unique and delicious every time (about $12-14/drink).   The pizza is excellent thin-crust style. They always manage to have just the right amount of char on the crust. They have numerous olive oils that you can dip your pizza or bread you order into. The fresh baked bread is also excellent.  The only reason it misses a perfect 5 is the price (very expensive - two pizzas, two drinks, bread and olives ran about $70. And the pizzas definitely feed only two people). Also, no kids menu, which makes things a bit difficult for us parents! If it were less expensive, we'd go way more often.  But as is, it's a great special occasion place.",

And we found this exciting little organic pizza place, Base Pizzeria.     The heavens were with us that day, for it was Tuesday and the pizzas was 50% off.  The pizzas are a pretty penny so the 50% off really came in handy.  The restaurant was clean, and well kept, and the service was fast and friendly, probably due to us being the only ones there at that time.  The pizza was absolutely amazing.  We only got their base, pretty much a cheese pizza with some green things on it.  We only wanted to test out the quality of the pizza and the best way to test is by ordering a plain cheese pizza.  That way you can focus on the tomato sauce and the cheese.  The tomato sauce on it was amazing and organic, you can really taste the flavour of tomatoes.  And the cheese was strong and perfect.    Overall a great pizza!  Overall a great experience, we will definitely be back, only if it was a lot closer.",

Finally the fates allowed and last week was my 1st taste of this often copied but never successfully executed pizza concept.  All the other pizzas I have had like this had 1 major flaw. The center crust (midlle of the pie) was always soggy, didn't hold up well if you like toppings and forget about reheating to a crispy state...Base won 2 of these categories...really? Only 2? Why?   1. No part of this delicious homemade crust resembles anything you'd call soggy...as a result  2. The crust holds up extraordinarily well even with a lot of toppings!  3. Reheat well? You kidding me? Like there's a chance I would leave a morsel behind! May never get a chance to test that feature out ;-)   Our server was amazing, funny and felt like an old friend.  Location - at the base of some beautiful Phoenix mountains (FYI Base pizzeria was named before this site was chosen.  The owners from Australia think base ingredients make up a truly great pizza)   $$$$ HALF OFF TUESDAY AFTER 3 PM - see website for exact details$$$$  5+ stars! Yelp should consider a 10 star system as this was truly remarkable and well worthy of its many accolades!",

    "text": "Checked out this pizzeria recently. It had a very cool vibe. The owners were actually waiting tables and interacting with guests....very pleasant atmosphere! We ordered two pizzas...(1) goat cheese, arugula and caramelized onions and (2) sausage, caramelized onions, crushed tomatoes and green chilies. Both were flavorful, but perhaps with slightly too thin of a crust. We finished with an Australian desert Pavlova, which was cream/meringue based with fruit and a raspberry glaze. It was a great light, summer desert.  But holy cow, we were charged $14 for one slice of this dessert!!!! That seemed extremely overpriced!!!! Guess we won't order from a verbal dessert list again!",

Remember those tombstone pizzas your dad used to make when mom was out with the girls? It's like the grown up version of that. Fancy sausage. Spicy, with a hint of sweetness. The fresh chile adds a nice contrast in texture. Sad to admit I ate the leftovers for breakfast (no cheat days here).",

    "text": "3.5 stars (upgrade to 4 stars if you come after 3 pm on a Tuesday when all pizzas are 50% off).  Focus is on lighter, healthier options.  Organic salads.  Pizza options are not greasy, cheesy, heavily sauced but rather are geared for more sophisticated, adult tastes.  Lightly topped with quality ingredients.  Very pleasant service.  I prefer the bar seating as the tables are pretty scrunched together in a long, narrow (though pleasant) space.  Patio looks nice but won't be of much use to anyone until about October...  But prices not cheap - we had an 'Almalfi' salad (good quality mozzarella and balsamic along with olives, shredded artichoke pieces, cucs, etc ) for about $15 - tasty but a tad pricey.  Organics cost more.  Good wine options but, like the rest of the menu, priced accordingly  (it's Paradise Valley adjacent, after all...).  The acid test for any artisanal pizza place is the crust, which here we found ordinary (chew, texture, char all a tad weak despite undoubtedly high quality flour used).  So what is left pizza-wise is basically some really nice, quality ingredients being gently placed on what tastes like a pretty ordinary base (pun!).    Come on a Tuesday and sample a few pies and see for yourself...  There is no such thing as guilt-free pizza, but the lighter, organic themed approach here only counts as one-half of a traditional pizza sin (unless you tack on a dessert, too).",

My roommate and I had the beet and arugula bruschetta, freshly served with balsamic reduction, and then we went for a Spicy Snag and a Mediterranean pizza...BOTH SUBLIME!! The crust is thin and crispy, and it makes that nice crunchiness sound when you bite it, you can tell it's good stuff! We loved the atmosphere as well, enjoying the mountains view with Frank Sinatra's songs (big thumb up for that) is just what you need to accompany a good meal!! I also appreciated their dessert selection: not the usual tiramisu or cannoli as you might assume in a pizzeria, they had the most extraordinary homemade Australian Pavlova and the portion was pretty generous too. Prices are fair, $10-15 for a pizza, $14 for the dessert - I was a bit turned off by that at first, but on second thoughts I agree it's totally worth it. Service was great, Carlee made our experience phenomenal. So we will definitely come back!!! :-)",

Otherwise, I think it can be a little pricey, but all of the food is organic, and I believe mostly, if not all, is locally grown/harvested. If you're adamant about organic or local food, then you probably don't mind the up-charge, in which case you're going to love this place any day of the week.   Monday evening gets you something like a charcuterie board and a bottle of wine for $20 or $25. On Tuesdays after 3pm (the best deal), all their pizzas are half price. They are great pizzas. My girlfriend and I got two and ate a little more than half of each so there was plenty to take home. Drinks are a little expensive so be mindful - most glasses of wine were around $12/glass.  Service was lovely. We had one of the owners wait on us (it's a brother and sister as well as her husband). We had the lady and she was spectacular. I would recommend anyone to try this place.",

From the perfect pizzas (thin crust, traditional and gourmet), to the oils adding different levels of spice to the pies (the oils, their creation), to the homemade dry tiramisu (with kahlua), best I've EVER had, fantastic selection of wines by the glass, this place is killer.  Do yourself a favor and check out their immaculate and stylish restroom just to get a peek at what a restaurant lavatory could look like.  Attention to detail is found everywhere!  Genuinely enthused, here!  Gorgeous patio view of Piestewa Peak with a blanket at each table during the chillier months.  And the personable Aussie owners (all three) and their loyal staff are integral to making the atmosphere of this place exceptional!  Beet salad, tiramisu, meat lovers pizza . . . some of my favorite offerings after about five times dining here.    Don't miss this rare find, I say.",

WHITE TRUFFLE PIZZA IS DEVINE. as is the bruschetta. Rustic just right crunchy chewy bread topped with amazingly fresh basil and tomatoes. We could have made a meal from this alone. It was a special occasion so on we went to dessert. Tiarmasu was the best I have had! Simple clean. Not soggy. I only wish we got our servers name as she was wonderful. This will be our new go to for a special night.     What an amazing night. I said BASE would be our new splurge. Our Anniversary was upon us and there was no where else I wanted to go. It's cooler now and the patio is spectacular. We had asked to reserve a patio table but were told they don't do that. We arrived early in hopes we would get seated on patio. They had flagged it and had specially reserved it for us.  The attentive details and wonderful suggestions continued at each course. Every time we have been there we end up talking to the table next to ours and find out that they too are fans. We love this place and tell everyone we can. We were humbled by the extra special personal attention. Please try this lovely spot these days customer service is so rare and they have been spot on each time we have visited.",

    "text": "I try to wait at least a month before trying a new restaurant so that their kinks can be worked out. After reading all of the great reviews I decided to take a chance on Base Pizzeria, and I'm very glad that I did! My husband and I came here for dinner last night and were instantly welcomed by the owner as we walked through the door. The owners were so friendly, engaging and nice! They're very passionate about their business and it shows. The menu consists of mostly pizza, salad, a few appetizers and they have a variety of wine, bottled beer and spirits from Arizona Distilling Company. Everything they have is organic and locally sourced. I always love being able to support local!  We chose the crispy proscuitto salad and the El Diablo pizza with a Pinot Noir for me and a Kellerweiss for my husband. I had ordered the Pinot Noir on the menu board, but was also given a taste of a bottle which they already had open. I ended up liking the tasting better than the one I had ordered, and will keep that in mind for next time. It was great that they had offered it to me so I could discover something new. The salad and pizza arrived quickly and both were fresh and wonderfully flavored. The proscuitto on the salad was crisped to perfection almost like a super thin bacon, all of the veggies were fresh and the strawberry balsamic vinaigrette had just the right bite. The El Diablo pizza had a slightly sweet hand crushed tomato sauce, which was very light and tasted of perfectly ripened tomatoes. The sopressata was delicate on spice, just enough to not overpower any of the other flavors. High quality Kalamata olives and roasted peppers made for a well-rounded dish. I would not hesitate to order either of these again.  In a neighborhood with tons of pizza options available you would think that they would have some stiff competition. With the high quality organic ingredients that they're using, incredibly welcoming service and delicious food, Base Pizzeria is a step above the rest. I have no worries that they'll be successful and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Props to them for putting together such a well-oiled machine in such a short amount of time.",

We sat out on the patio and I have to say their patio chairs were super comfy! It's a quiet shopping center so it was a pretty chill atmosphere.  We started with the pear and rocket salad - delicious! Fresh pears, arugula, candied pecans and just the right amount of dressing. It was a pretty big salad and we ate it all!  Next up we ordered 2 pizzas, although 2 people could easily get away with one and an app or salad. But we wanted leftovers so we got the Roni and the base with sausage added. They were fairly simple pizzas as far as ingredients but they were far from simple when it came to flavor.  Their pepperoni is some of the best I've ever had and the sausage was just right - not spicy, but very tasty. And the crust was done just right too - not burned or tasteless - really good. I can't really say which was better - they were both great.  Plus, I love that they use organic ingredients!   No doubt we will be returning to try more of their pizzas. Yum!",

They treat you like family.  The food is ridiculously good. Last time we went, we ordered a Caesar salad to share as a starter. They take great care and thought into each component of the dish. The produce was extremely fresh and tasty. The dressing was delicious. Even the croutons were unique and homemade with a delicious, slightly spicy flavor.  The pizzas... I was trying to figure out what their crust reminds me of and then it hit me. It is very similar to Indian naan bread, which is one of my favorite breads ever. It is outrageously good. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. So much better than Pizzeria Bianco's overly cooked crust! And without the snotty attitudes of Pizzeria Bianco's staff! The best crust I have had in Phoenix. The toppings are high quality ingredients and make for a very tasty pizza. Try them with their chili oils! You won't regret it.  The food is a little pricey but worth it. Especially when you have chains rolling out food for the same price but crappy quality. I recommend going Tuesday nights when pizzas are half-off.",

I had the one with roasted peppers, soppressata (I think), and another meat. It was perfectly leoparded - yes, that's the True test of a good pizza. Look for the leopard crust. For dessert we had the largest tiramisu I've ever seen, and the service was awesome.  This place lived up to the hype for sure.

We ordered the 'Meaty One' pizza and the crispy prosciutto salad and they were both delicious. The house-infused olive oils complemented our food well too.   Aside from the food, the warm hospitality and kindness of the Aussie owners were the highlight for us. Their recommendations were spot on and they were a pleasure to chat with! They are well travelled and we had a great time exchanging travel tips with each other.",

Yelp LOVES to drop places down to 4 1/2 stars as soon as possible and this still hasn't happened at Base Pizzeria.  Try the Carolina Reaper chili oil. Made on premises from local peppers and olive oil - sublime.  This is some of the best pizza available in Arizona and the best service in the area, bar none.  source: I was 320 pounds like maybe eight or nine years ago, so there was a time when I was eating a LOOOOOOT of pizza.",

I think visitors would enjoy trying a few local choices along with the others. I would give 5 stars if the wine/beer choices were a little more rounded out.",

It also has a dog friendly patio area that has a nice view of the mountains.  This is a fantastic, unique place for a date, but at the same time, family friendly enough to be a nice weeknight casual dinner.  Highly recommend.",

We had the Caprese appetizer, a Mediterranean pizza, a couple of beers, and closed it out with an espresso ice cream dessert. Everything was great, clean, and about as healthy as I'm comfortable with when it comes to pizza and beer!",

The pizza and salads were as good as others have reported.  The selection of wines by the glass is excellent and the pours are generous. Even the $8 Malbec was very good for the price.  My wife enjoyed the Aussie Shiraz at $11. Our friends chose the salad with the chocolate flavored olive oil - that's something very different....",

    "text": "I hate having to write bad reviews but it was clear that our waitress/hostess did not want to assist us. I came in to dinner last night with the little boy I nanny and we were told to pick a table. We sit down, and TEN minutes went by and we are finally brought menus and water. We are left for another 10 minutes a couple sits next to us and the waitress finally comes back to take our order. Fairly simple just the AZ easy bread and a margarita pizza. While we are waiting we see the couple next to us receive there food long before we did, meanwhile we were sitting there a good 30 minutes before these two arrived. Once the food came out our server was nowhere to be found. She stood idly by the bar not doing a single thing to the point where we had to flag her down just to get our check so we could finally leave. Definitely a disappointment. I'm 20 and with a 9 year old who is roughly the same height as me and we were clearly treated like we were children. My money is just as good as anyone else coming in to this establishment and should be treated as such.",

    "text": "This place is an easy 5 stars!!  After walking out of Central Bistro down the street due to disappointing service we totally lucked out and had a great date night dinner at Base!  We were seated immediately inside as the patio was full but looked really nice and even had blankets over the chairs.  Our happy, friendly waitress came immediately and asked if we wanted sparking water or \"table\"water in her awesome Australian accent!  To drink I ordered the hard apple cider and it was really good.  I ordered the mushroom truffle pizza and it was fresh and yummy.  They recommended the Caramelized onions and I probably should have added them as it would have given it a little sweetness but it was light and fresh and delicious just as it was. My boyfriend chose his own pizza and put roasted peppers Caramelized onions, and the sausage and cheese on it and it was really good too.  I'm not a sausage person but the meat was actually really tasty on it.  We had exceptional service, prices were good,  food was fresh and the atmosphere was fun and relaxed.  I think this is going to be one of our new go to neighborhood joints.",
