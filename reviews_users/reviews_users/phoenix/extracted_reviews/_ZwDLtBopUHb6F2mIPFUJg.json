    "text": "This is one of the True Arizona restaurants, and I recommend this place to anyone from out of town. Well, anyone in town too. The staff is extremely fun and nice, which is hard to come by these days.  The food is awesome. gigantic portions, but all the better to take home and enjoy the next day (or two...). The pizza and salads are my favorite, and of course one cannot forget the glutenous wonder of the pizza cookie (formerly the pzookie). This brings ooey gooey goodness to a whole new level.  The only downside... Its size, but that is part of their schtick. Get there early, whether it is lunch or dinner or expect to wait a long time. Trust me though, it is well worth it. This is the only one with decent parking!  **All the locations are great, the mesa one (one of the newest locations) is probably the worst, but I say that with a grain of salt. It is still better than most of the restaurants out there.",

Their cheesy garlic bread with marinara is amazing...their pesto bruschetta is unreal...I'm salivating just thinking of their Italian Gold wings (does ANYONE have the recipe to that sauce?)...the Big Rig with chicken is phenomenal (my favorite pasta dish ever).  And of course, you can't forget the pizzookie...I'm drooling just thinking of their menu.    For salads, their Caesar with chicken is great (they shave their chicken and season it in some kind of cajun spice) as well as the Pablo Picasso.    Ugh.  I think I may have to buy a ticket for later this month, just so I can eat there again soon.    The service is outstanding...every single worker smiles and greets you as they walk by you.    TRY THIS PLACE!  There's no better place in the WORLD!  Now if only they'd branch out to Chicago...",

The thing we particularly love about this place is the fair prices, the unique and warm atmosphere, and that the servers are always very personable.  We always arrive between 4-5pm and usually don't have to wait. The outdoor patio is very pleasant.  We have probably dinned here 20 times and it's always been a good experience.",

I tend t get impatient and I don't like waiting for more than fifteen minutes to eat.   Other than that, Oregano's is great.  There is not one thing that I have had there that I did not think was excellent.  I love their meatballs and wings.  And they also have outrageous deserts too.",

    "text": "This restaurant chain location is special because it is one of the few with adequate parking.  I'm sure it must have been an accident.  Just go to the Camelback, Scottsdale Rd, or Tempe locations to see the norm for this.  This location has run out of the Four Peaks draft beer on several occasions that I have arrived.  They offer their own house brew and their servers are completely ignorant concerning what style it is.  Their impromptu attempts at describing it are often contradictory, and nobody here knows this difference between an ale and a lager.  The wall paintings aren't as nice at the Shea location as others, but they seem to have a better turnaround and slightly less wait time than some of the other locations.  Maybe it is because people give up on the wait list and go next door to the other pizzaria?  This place is all about the image - the atmosphere, colorful menu, and silly T-shirts.  Food is pretty much average and bears little resemblance to genuine Chicago fare.",

Gorgeous patio, casual vibe, family-friendly, great service, and AMAZING food!  The antipasto salad was compact in size, but incredibly flavorful. The pizza (we had the pesto/sausage/gorgonzola on a whole wheat thin-crust) was fantastic. We had a total of four kids between us, and they each had a different pasta dish, all cooked perfectly. The warm cookie with vanilla ice cream for dessert was the perfect finish. Our little girl was asleep before we got her buckled into the car seat!  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "We were much more successful on our second attempt to dine at Oregano's, mostly because the first time we tried at about 6:30pm on a Saturday.  Sunday proved much less busy, although not quiet by any standards.  The place was still pretty packed, and for good reason: the pizza is delicious.  We ordered the Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato pizza and a large house salad.  Both were awesome.  The combination of toppings on the pie was perfect, and the thin crust was cooked just right.  The salad dressing was like a spicy, red eye-talian dressing that I could not get enough of.  They really do have a \"Menu can trust\" as stated on the shirts of the staff.  The service was great too, friendly, yet sassy.  Beers on tap left a little to be desired, but apparently we are \"spoiled\" in San Diego with our local brews.  I tried the local Four Peaks Kilt Lifter...not bad, but not particularly good either.  Nonetheless, SO glad we ate here!",

    "text": "Oregano's is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix if not anywhere!  Be warned though...you will have to wait most of the time.  We just plan that into our evening there (go an hour before we want to eat).  However, they have 3 bar areas that are open seating so you can always wait for one of those.  FOOD - If you haven't tried the deep dish Chicago-style pizza, go there tonight and get it!  It's the best thing on the menu and it's worth the 45 minute wait for it to cook (you can order it while your waiting to save time).  We get the Sproccoli and add chicken to it.  If you're in the mood for pasta, the Zany Ziti is out of this world (it's baked in a breadbowl).  Their salads are awesome as well (favorite is the Antipasto Thing).  The Garlic Cheese Bread is huge and really good!  And of course, you can't forge tthe Pizza Cookie (or Pizzokie).  It's outstanding....barely cooked cookie dough covered in ice cream!  SERVICE - It's always been excellent.  The staff is extremely friendly.  We've never had any issues at all with the service.  PRICE - We can eat here with a salad, pizza, and dessert for around $35 for 2 of us.  (And we ususally have left-over pizza as well.)  Trust me...go to Oregano's, get the Chicago Stuffed Pizza and you won't be dissapointed.",

I've probably been to Oregano's upwards of thirty times and I've not had a bad experience yet.  The lines outside of any of their restaurants should be a solid indicator of their quality.  Good pizza is hard to find out here in Phoenix, I've tried many and other than Rosati's I've really not been very impressed. Maybe when my tax check comes I'll take four hours and visit Pizzeria Bianco :)",

Happy to accomodate requests and even let us shift from inside to outside dining. Good on ya guys & gals. Half-star credit for that!  Atmosphere - The definition of casual dining. Lively, enjoyable and very laid back. We were there for a business dinner, but had fun enjoying the laid back feel and lively chatter. That gets 1 star from me.  Food - Let's put it this way - I felt like a horse with a salt-lick. Literally. And it just wasn't one pizza, it was all three. The waiter was kind enough to refund our money for the one I complained about, but it was just painful taking every bite. And I like a little salt on my food, so that tells you how bad it was. However, we loved the basket of fries... so that alone gets 1/2 star. Maybe it gets fixed in the future - they admitted they're talking to their supplier about the complaints in the saltiness.",

It always reminds me of a back east eatery except they have a wonderful outdoor patio life. They have wonderful flavored salad that are gigantic they could feed probably three hungry girls! They have a very large wine list, and a full bar. You can also place reservation for large parties. I would even recommend that you place a reservations if it's Thursday Friday or Saturday because the wait can be very long if you just show up. They do serve a Chicago style pie pizza, which is to die for! They do slices of pizza if you're trying to eat light or cheap during the lunch hour. And everything is literally made fresh, with very high quality.  The only thing that ever makes me sad here is that the ladies restroom only has one stall..... Other than that there is absolutely nothing to complain about!  the price point is right, the locations are great, the atmosphere is welcoming, and it doesn't matter if it's just you or a party of 30 it is a great choice for dining out as well as pick up!",

After a grewling double header (both wins), the baseball team opted for a late lunch, early dinner here on the way back to the resort. We had a large group, so it took a few minutes (hanging out in the bar and the boys ordering drinks there) before they were able to make spots for us to sit near each other. We were able to get two big booths in the back room. (Sadly, this room had no cable, so the all we got was some black and white movie rather than the football game.... though it didn't bother me much).   Each table had separate servers, since each had 7 people. Our servers were terrific. They were very attentive and brought us pitchers of water so we never ran out. We had NY style pizzas, lots of drinks, appetizers, and I am sure were just plain loud and roudy through all of it. But, they tolerated us, treated us well and even chimed in the fun. The pizza was great. Our table had the bbq chicken and an everything pizza combo. I loved the bbq, but am just not a combo fan. Everything was delicious and everyone was quite satisfied. The large pizzas are humongous and two seemed plenty for 7 of us (and that left even 6 pieces to take home. ) For appetizers, they ordered the cheesey garlic bread and the wings. All were good.   This place is fun and lively and has a really great patio. I would have loved to have sat out there. The warm fall weather would have been perfect for it. I would definitely eat here again. They have other stuff too, if you don't do pizza.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I love Oregano's. I come to this location all the time and order out all the time. So why only 2 stars? When I was here on New Year's Eve (early mind you, before 6pm) I had a shockingly bad experience. Here's why: 1. They had the bartender taking high tops. Anyone who has worked in a restaurant before knows just how illogical this is. And the guy was trying his best but i wasn't getting any service. I saw my order waiting on the line for at least 10 minutes before I stopped the manager to ask her to check on our food. When I said that having the ONLY bar tender try to serve bar guests and take high tops wasn't working, her response was \"we're busy\". No shit. I work at one of the most consistently busiest restaurants in Scottsdale so being busy isn't an acceptable excuse for poor service. The manager is reason 2. Why we had such a bad experience. Her attitude (the blonde manager) was dismissive, annoyed, and condescending. I told her I was a regular and not trying to be one of ~those~ complaining customers, that we love the food but that this was just a constructive criticism/comment because we just want to see Oregano's be the best that it can be. She obviously couldn't care less about customer retention or loyalty and her table-side with other customers seemed surprisingly sub par- especially for a manager. The reason this review is so low is mainly because of her as a person. I can forgive the bartender because it's not his fault that his \"section\" was unreasonable, he was hauling ass and doing his best. (Although his priorities were off, I feel like our waters should have been refilled before he clears bar seats of customers who've left. (Shouldn't oreganos have a dedicated busser?) but I get it. This experience won't stop me from coming to oreganos, I just won't be back in the evenings. (The only other less than stellar experience I've had here is in the evening with a clearly inexperienced waitress). The service is best in the afternoon- those servers are super friendly. In fact, several months ago, maybe a year ago, I had a server named Colleen (I think) who was so good and personable it inspired me to look for a serving job. I even applied at this oreganos location! The weren't hiring and I ended up getting a job at a higher end restaurant. So the fact that I'm compelled to write this review about the manager on my last visit shows how much I care.",

Saturday night - 20 minute wait in their large waiting area was do-able for my first time here. The seating hostess went OUT OF HER WAY to make us comfortable and came by and chatted while we waited. When does that ever happen? Almost never.  The waiter was first rate and received an appropriate tip - but it was the food that really earned five stars. A \"big\" house salad and a 12 inch pizza usually couldn't ever get 5 stars from me but the food (dinner for two) was something like $23. And the pizza was large, the thin crust was perfectly made and the toppings were generous and delicious.  Five stars well earned.",

We had about a 40 min wait to be seated which was fine because thats pretty normal for Sat night at Oregano's. We decided to order our food before we were seated since we were ordering a stuffed pizza. We put our order in 20 mins before we were seated.  After we were seated, we waited and waited and waited for our pizzas. I didnt time it, but we probably waited around 1 hour and 20 mins before our food came. We saw many tables come and go before we got our food.  Finally our food came and I couldn't wait to eat some delicious Oregano's pizza. Both pizzas were just bad. One had so much Cilantro on it I couldn't taste anything else. I have had that type of pizza at another Oreganos so I knew that it wasnt supposed to taste like that. Our other pizza was extremely salty and also not good. Even though we were extremely hungry we barely ate any of the pizza and took most of it home.   I though maybe they would taste better the next day but both pizzas have sat in our fridge mostly uneaten will need to be thrown out.",

We ordered 2 sandwiches to go and I specifically asked for coleslaw as my side. The man taking our order let us know that coleslaw always comes as the side, including chips and a pickle! I was very pleased with that and excited for my meal. We were told we had to wait 15 minutes for our food, no big deal. We actually waited about 25 minutes...no big deal, really. What my main concern is neither of us received our side of coleslaw and in one sandwich we found 2 black pubic like hairs. In addition, there were small fuzzy hairs all over my pickle. After seeing the 2 hairs in the other sandwich, I still tried to power through my own. Then after seeing the fuzzy pickle, I just could not even finish the first half of my sandwich. I'm extremely disappointed with this location and will not be returning.",

    "text": "It's no hint that Oregano's Pizza Bistro is a big contender in Arizona when it comes to pizza and Italian food. When the food comes out correct it's fantastic, but order it at your own risk. We use to frequent Oregano's Pizza Bistro 2-3 times per week, but not anymore since they've made changes to their menu and their ingredients. I think poor management is also a factor in multiple locations. We went in to this location yesterday and they messed up our order once again. It seems this is a constant issue with locations in the north valley, whether we dine in or take out. I will admit, Oregano's Pizza Bistro used to be my favorite restaurant a few years ago. Lately, mishaps like this though are more consistent and obviously are not good for business. Consistency is key with anything! Oregano's Pizza Bistro locations are becoming less busy lately no matter what day of the week it is and issues like this need to be addressed before it's too late.",

I ordered the calamari appetizer and it was so salty I could hardly eat it.  I had also ordered the coop de ville jumbo chicken parm.  THE COOP DE VILLE JUMBO CHICK PARM Hungry? We'll fill your tank with a great American classic! This model rolls off our assembly line and into your stomach with a HUGE all natural chicken breast served on a bed of fettuccine and topped with our homemade marinara, provolone and our four cheese blend. It's a real thrill ride. Hop in!  The huge all natural chicken breast was a piece of flattened breaded chicken breast that was over cooked almost burnt and again so salty I could not eat it.  Everyone at the table agreed that the calamari and my so called huge natural chicken breast were beyond too salty, it was inedible.  I told the waitress who wanted to get me another one, but by that time I was so off the food, I couldn't wait to get out of there.  Also, my sons ordered pizza that was so salty one of my sons could not eat that either.  She did not take that into account when giving us the bill.  Both of my sons have worked in food services and were amazed at the lack of quality and the lack of compensation for food that was unfit to eat.    Seriously, you can always add salt - you can never take it away.  What is with the cook at this location that the food is so bad?  Needless to say I would not go there again.  It was a disaster of a birthday dinner, to say the least.  I see other reviews about the salty food.  This is the email I sent to the corporate office.",

Being a Chicago native, I am always looking for good authentic Windy City pizza. Oregano's has it! Whether you like my favorite thin crust, or traditional stuffed deep dish, this place has you covered.  We had the thin crust and it was very good. Cheese and sausage werve stellar. Only draw back was the crust. While it was good, it was a tad under cooked with no cornmeal on the bottom. That's the only reason I didn't rate it five stars.  They also have giant, dirt-cheap kids meals including pasta. My kids loved it and it's great for families on a budget.  Make sure you save room for dessert. Oregano's warm chocolate chip cookie dough served hot with vanilla bean ice cream, and chocolate chips, is one of the best desserts we've ever had.  Service was hands-down perfect from the entire staff. Jordan was our server and was attentive, friendly and did an excellent job  Whenever we're in Scottsdale, we'll be back to Oregano's. Great food, great people and great prices.",

I'm glad we did just that! It was a warm, glorious Arizonia evening and Oregano's was the happening place. We didn't have a reservation so we ended up sitting on the deck and enjoying the evening. The host told us about an hour but it was more like 35 minutes. We'll take it!  We started with the Boom Dip. A nice blend of cheeses, spinach and artichokes served with a flatbread like chip. Man, was this good! The portions are HUGE and the prices are LOW. You do the math! Next, I had the Bollo Pasta. This was a simple angel hair pasta with Oregano's housemade Marinara. Packed with flavor and freshness. It was 6.99 and I couldn't make a dent. I was also informed that you could get refills on this pasta. My BF had the shrimp scampi. Non-traditional but tummy loving delicious. A nice kick of spice at the end and tons of shrimp. Now that I think about it, was this all a dream..? I wish there was a place like this in Los Angeles. You win Scottsdale. You win!",

So, we stood for about 30 minutes before we found seats in the waiting area. While waiting, they brought out complimentary pieces of cheese pizza. I've never had that happen before. When we finally got seated, it was difficult trying to read the menu that had red lettering. Good thing our friend had a flashlight. We had the thin crust pIzza and Caesar salad. With all the good food they serve, waiting in line for 50 minutes was nothing We've tried all the different locations and have never been disappointed.",

While it isn't as good as the Chitown joints I've been to, it's still cranks out a pretty good pizza pie.  The only drawback to ordering Chicago style pizza is that it takes so long to cook (it is a thick pie).  While there are other options on the menu (thin pizzas and pastas), I opted to wait for my thick and juicy pizza.  Overall it was pretty good and tasty and the service was decent, even though it was pretty slammed when we were there.  Thumbs up.",

With that said, Oregano's does a good job at attempting to duplicate the Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizza.  The crust is not that of Gino's East in Chicago, but it's not a bad second.  I wish they offered shrimp on their pizza like Giodarno's in Chi-Town offers, but they do offer \"hatch green chilis\" (A total Southwest thang!)  Nevertheless, I like it and it's good for my Chicago Pizza Fix!!  :)",

I've had the fried calamari and the guacamole, both of which are terrific! The guacamole comes with what is essentially a crunchy thin crust white pizza. It's delicious, but SUPER garlicky so avoid it if you're on a date. I've had both the deep dish and the thin crust pizza and they're both AMAZING. The deep dish is extremely filling and does take a long time to prepare, so if you're not trying to be there for a while, I recommend just sticking with the thin crust. The Cajun chicken topping is great on any of the pizzas :)",

    "text": "First try at Oregano's.  I tried during a prior week but the place was packed and a 45 minute wait.  Less of a wait this Friday so I made it in.  The decor is a super-cluttered, funky look.  Lots of odds and ends, mostly vintage with posters and photographs.   I was most fascinated by an old, wire, box-spring with large Christmas lights looming overhead serving as unconventional lighting.  Whoever came up with this was truly creative!     Ordered a $14 cheese pizza, thin crust and a side of meatballs with marinara sauce and cheese.   The hallmark of a good italian place is a good meatball and their eggplant parmigiana.  If they make these well (including a good marinara), it's a good place.    The meatballs came first and they were delicious.  They were not hard, not soft and like in The 3 bears, they were Just Right.  The herb combination was excellent.  Italian restaurants tend to err on too much oregano. They did not.  The marinara was good--not too sweet, not too acidic and not too much oregano.  So I was happy.    The disappointment came with the thin pizza which took \"thin\" to another level.  It was too thin from my New York Pizza Snob perspective.  Love thin pizza, but not this thin.  It was almost like it was a Pita bread crust, it was that thin.   The pizza had plenty of cheese so no problem there---our waiter, Jesus, asked if we wanted more cheese on top which we turned down.    We wanted a dessert such as Tiramisu and was disappointed to find that the only dessert was a pizza sundae of sorts.  I suggested to the waiter that some Italian desserts might be a good idea in an Italian themed restaurant.  He promised to pass the suggestion to \"corporate\".    Their prices are fair and because of this there were many families with children.... yes... lots of children, lots of noise, lots of children fussing and crying.  So if you don't mind the noise and you like your pizza super thin, this is the place for you.",

It can get very crowded on the weekends so be wary of that, but otherwise, the food is great and we've always had good service.  Some of the highlights:  1. Their pizza is really good.  The BBQ chicken pizza is surprisingly good (and doesn't look like I would have expected it to).  We usually get their regular crust which is very thin, but we also tried the pan crust once and really liked it (almost didn't deviate because the thin is so good).  2. Their pastas are also excellent.  The Big Rig is really good (and has a kick to it), and every other one we've ordered were great too.  It took awhile to even branch away from pizza here but we're glad that we're now confident enough to mix it up.  3. Their lunch deal is impossible to beat...a slice of cheese for I think $2.95.  It's a modest amount for one person.  Toppings are extra, but unless you load it up, it's a great deal.  4. If you sign up for their emails, you'll get a free skillet cookie for your birthday.  They are amazing.  Needless to say, if you can make it in for lunch on your birthday, you will be very full for an almost criminally low bill.  Bottom line, this is a really good place for a dinner out.  Casual, fun, reasonably priced, and good food.",

My fiance is from outside of Chicago, so next time we go we are going to try the deep dish.

    "text": "Went there for dinner tonight with my husband and 15 month old son and we all left very happy!  First off, with my 15-month old, he's at a stage where he doesn't want to be spoon-fed, but isn't very good at feeding himself yet. I hate going to a place where the cheapest item on the kid's menu is $8 because 75% of it will wind up smeared on the table, highchair, and on the floor. Oregano's offers a kid's slice for $2.99. Can't beat that price! In addition, it came out cut up into little kid-sized chunks AND the staff moved it off of the hot plate it was cooked on and onto a cooler platter. THANK YOU! I very much appreciate not having to shuffle the whole table around to avoid my son burning his hand on a hot plate!  The atmosphere is fun, casual, and lively. We sat indoors, but even in the heat of Scottsdale in June, the patio seating was shady and cooled by misters. We could've enjoyed our stay there, too.  Our server (Justin, i think?) was incredibly attentive without being overbearing. He never let our drinks run dry and was just really, truly, a pleasant addition to the evening!  We ordered the Boom Dip. YUM! I'm a big fan of spinach artichoke dip, but this is definitely a contender for the best I've ever had. Very heavy on the artichoke where most are mainly cheese. I liked it!  My husband and I split the O-Riva Pizza. The ingredients were very fresh and the crust was super thin. I personally would have preferred a little bit thicker crust, but I'll just try out a pan crust next time. The taste was great.  In all, we had a very good time. It was a great place for dinner with the family and we'll definitely be back to check out more of the menu.",

    "text": "While in Phoenix we were told that the best place for pizza was Oregano's. So the senora and I decided to swing by and check things out. We did check in a bit before the crowd arrived and were seated right away. The place was pretty cool and old style musica played in the back ground. I kept waiting for Frank Sinatra to make an entrance.  Our server was very nice and gave us the tour of their menu and drinks. We ordered drinks and then decided on a Chicago styled deep dish pizza with dinner salad. It took about 45 minutes to get our pizza but when it arrived looked sabroso. The pizza was very good but I must admit that the tomato sauce used needed a bit more spices because it tasted a bit bitter.   Other than that, the pizza and salad hit the spot and enjoyable to eat. It will be on our list of future pizza eating when we are on Phoenix.",

    "text": "Wow....I have been to Oreganos for many times in my life but this is my first review!  To start I truly believe this is the best pizza and maybe best local restaurant that we have in the Phoenix area. I love the Chicago stuffed crust pizzas we got it with Pineapple, ham, garlic last time, and I was truly in heaven. The crust is almost pie like and it's unreal. I've had deep dish in Chicago before and this is the closest too, but yet so Arizona. I actually prefer the way Oreganos has it. Only if they had a west valley location...hint...hint.  Anyways we had great service and shared a small stuffed crust pizza. Wow. We only ate 1 slice each and took most of it home and it lasted us at few more days.  We were too full to eat a pizza cookie, but I've had so many of them before and each were great.  We were really trying to save room but just couldn't squeeze anything else in because the pizza was so filling!",

It was the St. Louis/flat style. It was to die for. My dining companion had a sandwich. I was told to get the deep dish cookie but, people people, there was no room for cookie. Next time. Had to send the left overs home with the friendly locals sitting next to me. Wow, were they ever so lucky to be sitting next to me that day?",

The group decided we should get what we ordered, so we ended up talking to another server who wasn't ours and getting the problem solved.   The right pizza took another 50 minutes to come out and the drinks took quite some time too. Our server seemed nice but also seemed to avoid us a little bit.   Finally the right pizza came out but was over-cooked to the groups liking.   We asked to speak to a manager and Tammy came out and was great! She appreciated our honesty, apologized for the negative parts of our experience and was even gracious enough to buy our appetizer, pizza and offer a gift card. We so appreciate her demeanor and appreciative attitude toward us. Thank you, Tammy! We will definitely be back.",

I had their version of an Italian Grinder with waffle fries and a side of the gardiniera. The bread was toasted perfectly, the fries nice and crispy. I went with the jr. size sandwich and was glad I did, it was the perfect lunch size serving.  My partner decided on the all-you-can-eat lunch pasta special with the addition of meatballs.   To their credit the soft drinks and water come in HUGE glasses. I love it when a restaurant gives me a big glass of ice water with my meal. Saves them from refilling it every 5 minutes when it's a small glass.  Our server, June, was great and originally from Chicago!

A nice place to go after a fun day at a spring training game, round of golf or day exploring. Be prepared for a brief wait, but definitely worth the wait!  Our experiences this trip were not as good as we've experienced in the past. We had dinner there twice this trip with average results. The first night our pizza took an hour to be served. Once I saw larger parties getting their food before we did and they were seated after we were! I pointed this out to our server who then brought out our food, cold!

Boom dip is so delicious with the pizza crusts served on the side as the bread for this dish, garlicky, soft and warm. The meatball sandwich is one of the best i have had along with the golden wings. I love the pizza, thin crust, thick or pan, it has wonderful flavor and is worth the wait.",

I spent the winter from Chicago and let me tell you, it was painful to find good pizza.  Then I found Oregano's.  Thank you!  And you cut it correctly - in SQUARES.  YAY!  Forget about NY style pizza, that is greasy, pie wedge, floppy.  Bleh.    Ordering for pick up is a bit of a pain - they only offer \"pick up times\" and often too late.  This is not a place you can pick up in 30 minutes.  I wish they were get that sorted.  Love me some Pepperoni or Sausage thin crust.  Its got the right salty balance.  So cracker thin, you can eat the entire thing yourself.",

    "text": "I tried to take the family here for dinner 3 times.  Each time, we were told the wait was 30+ minutes.  Since I hate waiting and they don't take reservations, we passed and went somewhere else.  On the 4th attempt, The Better Half went ahead of time to put our name on the list so that I could join them later when we got seated....it worked perfectly.  I was in a business meeting and she timed it perfectly so that I was able to make it right after my meeting.  We ordered:  Appetizers Spinach Artichoke Dip <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=kmUXZrIRtqqJbOxfJeksrw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwD...</a> Sweet Potato Fries <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=0FNCsaKdjoPOayWsFC8x5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwD...</a>  Pizzas 10\" Thin Crust - Onions, Green Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=dD0jzKpj2Oh-eaE7sVvLZw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwD...</a> 8\" Thick Crust - Pepperoni, Sausage <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=VxSsA7mn7xU0QCmvjHrfUg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwD...</a> 10\" Thick Crust - Anchovies, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese, Onions <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=HOLWbqCsw7-cPBoyFTY19Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwD...</a>  Yeah....we were hungry!  We ordered too much food and had to take a lot of it home.  The Pizzas were cooked well done, per our request.  We enjoy well done Pizza.  Because the ingredients are fresh, it took 45 minutes for the Pizzas to come out.  I had the Thin Crust.  After such a long wait, I had high expectations....unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was just OK.  The Crust didn't have much flavor and the ingredients, while fresh, didn't hit my taste buds on a positive note.....damn.  The rest of the family felt the same way about their Pizzas.  Kiddo had the Thick Crust Pepperoni & Sausage....he too is a Pizza lover like me and he said his was just OK.  Mom & The Better Half had the other Pizza and they too were underwhelmed.  The Appetizers were the highlight of the evening.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was delish & the Sweet Potato Fries were awesome.  Overall, it was an average dining experience.  Was it worth the long wait to get in, then the long wait to get your Pizza?  No.  Return Factor - 10%",

    "text": "I wish I didn't, love everything about this place, but I do.  That's why I have to show restraint and not eat here as often as I'd like; because if I did, I'd weigh a lot more than I already do.   When you walk up to be seated, you're sure to be greeted with friendly smile.  In fact, if a waiter happens to walk by with a tray full of food, he'll probably say hello too.  Even the bartender might wave to you.  Obviously, the management here places a huge emphasis on attentive service in a friendly environment.  The wait staff wears t-shirts with clever sayings on the back, such as \"Legalize Marinara\" and \"Size Matters.\"  You have a choice whether to sit inside our on the patio.  If the weather is good, I opt for the patio.   It has more action and great people watching.  The menu is insane and offers too much temptation.  Anything I've ever eaten here has been great.  So I'll focus on my favorites.  My favorite appetizer is the stuffed mushrooms, filled with Italian sausage and covered with marinara sauce and cheese.  My favorite salad is the Pablo Picasso: Romaine lettuce with fajita chicken, cheese, tomatoes, onion and cilantro, then topped with tortilla strips.  The dressing is some sort of spicy jalapeno dressing.  The best pizza, in my opinion of course, is their Double Stuffed, like a deep dish pizza on steroids.  It takes 40 minutes to bake, so sit back and enjoy a couple of beers and wait for the grand entrance of your crusty cheesy tomato treasure.  Not that you'll have any more room in your tummy, but if you do, go for their Pizza Cookie.  It's a half pound of chocolate chip cookie dough, slightly baked and then topped with ice cream.    Try to visit Oregano's at \"off times\" so the wait will be shorter.  When it's busy, the wait time can be more than one hour.  But if it is, a server is likely to come out to the waiting area and serve you nibbles of thin crust pizza.  Is this place a slice of heaven, or what?",

Working with Jane to plan the event and menu was easy, efficient and she was great to work with. On the day of, the room was ready early, I could decorate early, bring in a cake and serve it, no problem. The room was perfect, the video hookup was easy so I could show a movie, and the service was excellent. The food was piping hot and excellent. The staff boxed up the leftovers and we ate for four more days! It was on a busy Saturday night in May, but our group felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant. I highly recommend working with Tammy and the staff at Oreganos as a venue to hold your next group party. Ciao!",

    "text": "This is my absolute favorite pizza place to come to in the Scottsdale area! I have been during lunchtime and dinner time and there is always a wait and I can say it is definitely worth the wait!   Dinner: They have a large menu with large sized portions to allow for equal sharing with your party. The calamari is thin and crispy, and the cheesy bread is a favorite, it's delicious. They have a wonderful salad selection with the Caesar being a personal favorite that isn't overloaded with anchovy taste. The pizza here is the real deal; they can make any size pizza with a wonderful array of toppings, and the menu options are excellent. the Stuffed pizza is a deep dish take on pizza loaded with flavors and should be tried if you can handle the cheese. My favorite is the thin crust pizza that isn't too thin to be crispy bread, but keeps it's crunchiness with a soft bite. The Bistro Classic is a mouthwatering white pizza and the Aunt Margherita is one of the best Margherita pizzas I've ever had.   Dessert: The Pizza cookie is an absolute must and I have overheard people saying that they will wait an hour just to be seated and enjoy one. Chocolate chip used to be my favorite, but the Salted Caramel might have recently best it out. I was informed last time that they can even do half and half so you can eliminate the stress of the choice. The cookie is in its own personal pizza dish and has lumps of delicious vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips; the perfect additions for a flavor explosion!  Consensus: The wait may be long but it's for a good reason; the large portions and delicious pizzas that are crafted have some of the best flavors that take you to Chicago or Rome. Dive in but save room for the desert!",

Not a fan of oregano on the pizza either.  The Caesar salad with chicken was actually the star of the show. The pizza was definitely good, but the salad was awesome.

This is a sign of inexperience in the kitchen & inattentive management. This is not a pizza where you can get a redo in 15-20 minutes. So having to wait another hour to make it right gets old very fast. I am sorry to say that we will never eat here again. Fortunately, there are now other options in the local area that make this style of pizza. Bye Bye...",

That being said, Oregano's is a solid place with good service and consistently delicious food. My go-to is either the   Bollo Pasta or eggplant parm and either are tasty and reasonably priced choices, especially the unlimited Bollo Pasta. Their thin crust pizza is really good too. Save room for dessert because the Pizza cookie is my absolute favorite thing here. Bonus - they let you combine 2 flavors as a half and half option.",

The service was pleasant, informed and efficient, including the hostess and the server.   I ordered the Big Slice, with two meats. I added an iced tea for $8.27. A good lunch deal!  My lunch arrived in 14 mins.   The pizza was a pre-made thin crust 2 slices of cheese pizza, with the meats added later. As I picked up a piece, the meats fell off and scattered across the table. I had to eat it NY style (folded), much to my chagrin. It had ample toppings, even after I lost a lot of them but what a mess.   The pizza had good sauce, extra heavy with oregano (go figure).   Not sure the pizza lunch special was executed properly. Clearly I ordered the wrong lunch for me. Perhaps something else off the menu next time.",

The mall parking lot however has lots of space and we took advantage of that.  I generally like Oregano's but the wait at most locations keeps me away.  Maybe it was timing but on a recent Saturday mid-afternoon, 2 of us were seated immediately.  Gasp!  I think this location may seat more than some of their stores.  We were seated at a bartop that seemed right in the middle of traffic.  Asked to move to a booth, no problem there.  Service was friendly and as fast as can reasonably be expected with pizza at Oregano's.  I like their thin-crust pizza and they deliver this as expected.  Don't waste your time w/ the pizookie (or whatever it's called baked cookie) unless you enjoy squishy semi-baked cookie dough (ugh).  Kind of funny that it's always half-baked as they make a big deal about advance-ordering and ask you WHEN you order your entree if you want desert because it takes time to bake.  What??   Glad to see Oregano's growing.  We will be back.",

Really, the cheapest thing you stock your bar with is the glassware.   I ordered my usual vodka rocks with a lemon. What came to me looked like a shot glass, with a little alcohol in it and this oversized lemon wedge.  If it wasn't so pathetic, it would have been comical.  I really should've taken a picture of it. After complaining to the waiter, thinking he brought me a shot, he went and got the barmaid, who explained to me that they really don't consider themselves to have a full bar - it's actually a \"mini-bar\" - and no, they don't have rocks glasses, and this drink is the requisite one and a half shots of liquor.  \"Sorry,\" she said. The pizza was good, as usual.  Just was disappointed at this, what seemed tacky, situation with the glasses.",

It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.  We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80.  Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck.",

The waitstaff is consistently casual, cool, and friendly--it's been this way for several years, every single time, without fail.  The pizza is outstanding. Fresh avocado sliced on top of a chicken pizza keeps us coming back every time. We've never gone wrong. And the pizza cookie is amazing.  Just adding another 5-star review to a great place.",

They have changed the menu so no longer is the Junior sausage sandwich available, just the regular.  Ok, we like leftovers but guess what? The \"regular\" size is the same as the Junior was but the price went up!   Then I ordered the Bollo Pasta, which usually comes with 2 large slices of garlic toast.  Instead it came with 2 tiny bites.  No Parmesan was offered, the sausage sandwich had zero sauce so we had to order that extra, and my husband's last straw - they changed from Coke products to Pepsi!  Our waitress said there were numerous complaints about this but Pepsi is cheaper for management to serve.  Overall it appears management is scrimping on all the things that have made this place a favorite.  It will be replaced as our go-to weekend restaurant.  So sad.",

However this experience was so bad that we have to mention it in hopes that they can fix these issues. We came in on Tuesday night around 7:30 it wasn't to busy normally we always end up on a wait. Worth the wait usually. We asked if we could sit outside we were told we couldn't it was closed. Strange we have always been able to in the past and we had out of town visitors that wanted to take advantage of the warm night. So we were sat inside instead. Maybe they didn't want to have to walk outside to serve a table. Took forever for the waitress to even come to our table. Then another 6 min to bring us 4 waters. She never once checked back on us after the food was dropped off making it hard to order anything else throughout the meal or for her to do a quality check. The worst part was she brought the dessert out with our table full of plates, and pizza pan there was hardly even room to set it down. She managed to find room without even pre bussing. She knew we had dessert coming would have been nice if she cleared they table first. Horrible service. Good food. However service can def make or break the place. We raved to our guests about this place instead they had the same reaction we did horrible service.",

    "text": "Shame on you Oregano's for the food you served at  the Murder Mystery that is performed at the Shea location.  For a price of $64 per person, the food was so poor but the play was good. We were a group of 18 and the food was of such low quality, none of us would go back again for the pizza and show. Two low quality pizzas (thin crust with cheese and the other with pepperoni).  One table did not receive any pizza until all other tables were done and had to stop the actors/servers from removing our plates as we had not eaten as they had ran out of pizza before table was able to go through. Unfettered line.  The two inexpensive casseroles were a light cheese pasta and a spicy chicken pasta but some said they did not see or taste chicken.  I overheard one of the actors (while I was going to the restroom) to someone who was to bring the pizza to us \"this is inexcusable\". I agreed completely. I know you have good pizza and salad but you need to get your \"act\" together for the show.   The actors were doing a fine job and I think our tip that night covered them but we had already prepaid a tip to the restaurant and I don't know why.   I would say we were a captive audience and since already prepaid, you must have thought--anything goes!   Sell only pizza and get out of the show business or improve what you serve to the captive audience.  Management of the Shea restaurant, I hope you read this.",

    "text": "I've been told that this is one of my friend's and her husband's favorite place to dine. In fact, they had been here the week before I arrived in Phoenix. It had been a while since having Italian fare, so I was happy to check things out here.  Oregano's pizza Bistro restaurant is a quaint little place that reminds me of being at either Chilis or Buca Di Beppo Italian cuisine restaurant - at least how the restaurant space is conveniently set up. We arrived here on a nice Thursday just after 12:20pm after a morning of shopping and errands. There wasn't that much activity here, but it took a while for the food to be presented to us. While everything looked and tasted well, wish it would have been expertly prepared in a quicker fashion. It must have been around 20-25 minutes after ordering before the food arrived. I realized that perfection takes time, but I guess it's better than overlooked and overlooked pasta! It felt longer than it was, maybe. The ambiance here was very much casual and quiet. Really like this kind of ambiance especially when you hit a certain age and need that quiet time away from life. Lol I did enjoy this place, even though the wait time was a tad slower than I thought.  The overall experience here at Oregano's pizza Bistro restaurant was good and nice. We actually got a booth near the entrance and there was nice air conditioning, especially nice when the temps were in the 90's outside. I can believe that summer time out here in the desert can get hot hot and toasty for sure! Oregano's Pizza Bistro is located at 7215 E Shea Blvd, in Scottsdale, Arizona. They accept major credit cards, so that's always a great thing! They have ample parking options, considering that they are in a strip mall and have plenty of neighboring merchants to support them. I really wished I did get the pizza though, but the prices were kind of high for that. I opted for the cheaper $10 option of the lasagna, which ended up decently good. I haven't had good lasagna in a while, so this meal really did hit the spot. The taste was good and delicious, although not mind blowing great. It hit the spot after an afternoon of shopping and walking around. Oregano's Pizza Bistro is clean and well managed. Definitely well worth the trouble of getting here.  I didn't take photos of the food, menu, and others because my iPhone decided to die on me just before we entered the restaurant. Needless to say, that it would have been better with photos though. Lasagna in a hearty meat sauce, along with 2x of Diet Coke makes this meal extra special. Too bad that I was driving, but i would totally have had at least one beer or something with the meal. Oh well. This was just lunch and I'm sure that this place is probably Rocking at dinner time! The service here was very nice and friendly. The best kind I'd say. Makes life worth living, if being served with a smile. I guess the wait was worth it. The server was nice and gave me my refill of Diet Coke without me asking for a refill. That's service right there. Thanks to my Scottsdale friends for bringing me here to this place and hanging out with me on my vacation to Phoenix, AZ and the surrounding communities.  4.0 stars for the lasagna. 4.0 stars for the ambiance and the service. I realize that I was on vacation, so waiting is a virtue. Way better than being stuck at the office.  Support local!  B+",

Reservations are honored within expected sit time, but enjoy a few minutes at the well stocked bar, tended by a friendly staff. At the table, multiple choices will make it difficult to limit it to only one visit: Caesar salad is one of the best around, perfectly seasoned with the right amount of garlicky dressing. Then enjoy the pasta dishes, where Italy meets Mexico, if you like them hot, you will not be disappointed. Neither were we on our third visit, greeting, food, service, price, consistently close to perfection. No wonder Phoenix, and beyond, noticed. But put your name on the list: smelling without eating is torture. 5 stars, well deserved.",

But the manager immediately came to our table explained what happened and apologized. He offered another appetizer on the house but I opted for a discount and he gladly agreed. This whole time the waitress was attentive and super nice. So much I didn't even mind the wait. When the time came to pay the bill it turned out the manager had discounted the whole thing. I was honestly surprised.  What impressed me the most wasn't the meal being free. It was the fact that he came to the table and took responsibility for what happened. Real customer service is putting the customer first and you can tell this place provides it and then some. The food was fresh and delicious. This was my daughter's first time there and she loved it.  I want to say thank you to Oregano's because good customer service is hard to find. I totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal and and an even greater staff and management.",

Okay, maybe not, but it should be there. The only thing truly vegan on the menu is the guacamole, so they claim. The pastas all have cheese, even just red sauce pasta (they cook the cheese into the sauce), my sources reveal. The only reason I find myself at Oregano's is if one of my friends is getting a melted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it, which, to be honest, looks delicious.",

It's no wonder it can take over an hour to get a table!  This is a relatively small place, considering all the people that love to eat here, so make sure you get there early. Since we always have a large group with kids, we go around 4:30 to get started, and we spend a few hours. It works great. The bar is also really small and only serves beer and wine. This isn't bad unless you're with a LOT of kids... then hard alcohol would be nice! LOL  I have never seen pizzas this size before. The pest penne past is incredible. And... I know, I know... they have great salads! This is definitely a \"sharing\" restaurant!   We love Oregano's and we all look forward to our nights spent with the Oregano's family!   See ya next spring!",

    "text": "Ok so from being from San Diego I just moved out to Scottsdale a few weeks ago and have been looking for great Chicago style pizza. I had been told about a few places and I finally tried Oreganos and its the best thin crust pizza in AZ. Both of my parents were born and raised in Chicago so I have known what great pizza is from them.  I got a sausage and green pepper thin crust pizza and it was perfect. I was also told by the host on the phone that the wings are really good so I got some Italian gold wings and they were very good too. Now I took it home so I didnt get any dessert but I hear the cookie with ice cream is amazing.   I look forward to going again and make sure you go early and still plan on waiting haha. I called in my order on a friday night at 5:45 and it still took an hour but was well worth it and I will be back again and again.   I told my parents about this place and they are excited to try it when they come visit at the end of the month. I look forward to trying other stuff as well. Also all of the stuff are super nice and everyone says hello and asks how you are doing. I love it. Go to this place ASAP and enjoy.",

    "text": "Yum yum yum...  Let's start off with the service...our server was awesome. We had to wait quite some time before being seated and were starving. So she brought us some bread and butter to hold us over.  We started off with some wings. They are absolutely delicious here. My suggestion is to request a mix of the honey sauce and the medium sauce. It is finger-licking good. Literally.  On to the pizza. It was really good. Nice thin crust, baked to perfect crispy perfection. The toppings were fresh, and the amount of sauce was great. I hate getting a thin crust pizza with too much sauce. Soggy thin crust is an oxymoron to me.   If you manage to have room, you HAVE to indulge in the baked cookie. You have the choice of peanut butter, macadamia nut or chocolate chip. OR you can do half and half. So worth the extra hour on the treadmill...  The only downside...the wait time can be long, especially on weekends. The upside to the downside, the servers do come by frequently to liquor you up and make the wait a little more bearable...",

I am familar with their training staff to greet/say hello to EVERYONE, but this can get annoying when one is not even making eye contact with you. It was FREEZING inside the restaurant and even at the outside bar. Initial greet at bar was pleasant but name was never given. Once we ordered bartender really never noticed us again. I was going to ask about temperature but couldn't catch her eye. Saw one patron go get a coat from her car, which I was forced to do as well. 2nd shift came on and proceeded to talk about her school problems at loud volume for an extended period of time, then changed into her work shirt BEHIND THE BAR. Everyone seemed preoccupied with the obvious regulars at the end  of the bar. food was good as usual.",

    "text": "First visit to Oregano's and if I lived in Scottsdale it would not be the last. I ordered a side salad which was huge, three of us shared it and we still had leftovers. The food is an interesting mix of Italian and Southwest. For example I love to try an arabiatta sauce with shrimp and I had the Oregano's equivalent that had a half pound if perfectly cooked shrimp with their own unique spicy sauce served with linguini and garlic bread. What made this dish unique to Oregano's is the cojita cheese and pico de gallo which made it so good. It was spicy and delicious. My friend loved her lasagna recommended by our server Stevey (he was an exceptional waiter) and she liked the spicy kick. The three of us shared a half chocolate chip half white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie and it was melt in your mouth yummy. Maybe it's a good thing I don't live here or that desert would be deadly for my waistline. Great restaurant, great service and spectacular food!",

I wouldn't rip you a new one and you would insure that if I ever came back, you would provide some consistency to he food. I never said your food was stellar, I just wanted to get the same crap I got the first time. I upheld my end of the bargain, you took my fair review and screwed me. On my second visit, I ordered a meatball sub, again. I wanted the Jr. The same as I had before when you included the waffle fries that were not needed. This time you served me a whole sub, not what I wanted and there were no fries. I didn't want them, but where were they? How was the sub? Yuck! I could have got a better meatball sub at Subway. Do you understand how insulting that comment was? Oregano's, I said Subway. That is bad, dude! Bad!! I guess what we have determined is that you just suck. You are another horrible, fake Italian restaurant, serving food that Chef Boyardee would be ashamed to put his face on.  Oh yeah, where was the cute blonde at the register? If you are going to serve bad food, always make sure there is a cute blonde serving me, not a fat guy with glasses in a white t-shirt. That just makes the whole experience even worse.",

    "text": "I like Oreganos. For what it is. the service is ALWAYS stellar. they accommodate every type of party that walks in the door. I give any business kudos for that. The food is good. Not GREAT, but good. I've had several items since moving here in January 2012. The portions are absolutely enormous. Be warned. The JR salads are still enough to share. I've had the thin crust pizza, which to me was standard zaa... Good sauce, nice amount of cheese. Standard for a thin crust. The Chicago stuffed was another story.. I was really looking forward to this one since I saw the neighboring table chow down. We ordered a basic pizza with pepperoni, sausage and caramelized onions. It came looking amazing! And it wasn't bad, it was just loaded with so much cheese that it took over any toppings one might like to enjoy. Another minus (for me) was that instead of their nummy sausage chunks it was layered with enormous slices of sausage to the point where besides the sick amount of cheese that was all you could taste. It by no means was inedible but be warned. I wouldn't order it again and it was NOT Chicago style. I've also had their Diablo shrimp pasta dish and sadly it was great the first time and not even spicy the next. I will still eat here as it is a great place to chill and get some grub but if your looking for Chicago zaaaa... find somewhere else...  All in all, a good standard place to eat, exremely nice servers and decent food. just not what I want when I think of the good ol Midwest pizza.",

Or rather, just insert some more of Oregano's pizza into my mouth!   Mmm mmm! Get the guac-a-tony. I know what you're thinking. Italians? Pizza? Guacamole? Really? Yes, really. They serve typical guacamole, but instead of tortilla chips you get a 14-inch pizza crust topped with a thin layer of parmasean cheese to scoop up all of the avocado-y goodness. Salivating yet? You should be. Beware! It's a HUGE portion. Made more for four than for two, but we held our own. Pizza itself was phenom. Thin, crispy, great flavor in the sauce. My only regret was that we ate so much guac-a-tony that we couldn't eat more pizza. Hopefully there's a next time if I'm ever back in Scottsdale!",

I'm used to receiving good service, but this place went above and beyond to make me feel important, even when the place is packed on a Friday night. Moving my order up the queue so it would be done sooner, accompanying me to the area where the pick-up was (I was a newcomer), and then being almost the friendliest servers I've ever dealt with (seriously). That isn't even mentioning the pizza, which was by far the best I've had since moving here and is a close second to Brooklyn Pizza in New York. We tried Rossati's a couple of weeks before, and Oregano's blew them away. Amazing pizza, great service, and a price that is comparable to any pizza joint in town.",

The best thing about Oregano's is not only do they have FANTASTIC pizza, their other dishes are the bomb food. In particular, the Big Rig pasta, with two meatballs. Mmmmmmm. So yummy. At lunch they have an amazing special, one slice (which is the size of two slices at any other place) for $2.50, plus toppings. I get pepperoni & (crumbled)sausage and it's under $6, not counting the beer. Speaking of beer, they always have a handful of local breweries represented, including Four Peaks (love their beer). If you eat at the bar during the day, you'll likely get the BEST bartender Christine. Once she meets you, she'll remember your pizza and drink choices, and probably your name. She's just the best! Thanks Christine for always making my lunch GREAT. Oh, and don't forget to get a pizza cookie (if you have room).",

Our waitress was nice as well but she told us our salad was going to take 5 minutes but it came out with our pizza 30minutes later. Wah wah. My mom and sister even told her we were hungry. I think that just might have thrown them into hangry mode.   We had the pineapple stuffed pizza. I've had chicago pizza and they TRY to mimic them. Close but no cigar. Nevertheless, it was filling and descent. I definitely prefer the Bistro Classic, garlic sauce based thin crust pizza. It was much more flavorful.

Even when the food took a while to come out, which is understandable because Oregano's, she kept making sure we were good and was quick with getting our drinks! Shout out to the manager Tarrell as well who helped her out that night with dropping off our food and checking in. These are the type of servers that makes a person want to come back to a restaurant!",

I continuously always order either the Beef Bistro salad (amazinggg) or the Alfredo the Dark. The beef bistro is a spicy spinach beef salad, really great never had anything like it.  Alfredo the dark is their spicy version of Alfredo pasta. Of course you can't come to Oreganos and not get a pizookie! Absolutely one of the best desserts I've ever had - and I have a sweet tooth.

    "text": "Initially, the atmosphere brings you in. The theme of the restaurant is overused ( 1930 s-1940's decor with old magazine covers,fake reproductions and retro decor. The temperature inside the dining area was cold, with no fireplace or heater and the windows open.  So,that being said I was uncomfortable from the start.( It was 50 degrees outside which is cold for us zonies. The hostess and waitress were excellent, and very cordial,unfortunately for them the food was sub par and gave me an atrocious 2 day case of either indigestion or e-coli poisoning ( I'm not sure which)  . I ordered their house \"Oreganos \" salad with added chicken.  The temperature was too warm for a salad and the chicken was cold ( should have been opposite) , perhaps that is where  the problem started? Next, we were brought out a small deep dish pizza with sausage that was runny and not what I would expect for a 16 dollar pizza.  Disappointed and not tasty at all. The next entree was a 16 inch thin crust that was better, but the crust was limp and not crispy like a hand made thin should be.   Again way too much money for the low quality. My child had a small caesar salad and she also developed indigestion, but perhaps that was just coincidental. In their defense , it was relatively busy, but not THAT busy,so either the cook needs some more lessons or they were just sloppy on this particular evening ( Sunday) I have dined at other Oreganos locations for lunch and it has been a hot or miss. This trip was overpriced and make me sick at my stomach. 60 dollars...no beer or wine and I had water to drink.....No way..Next time I will be driving by Oreganos to a better tasting place Pocketdogg",

Last night we went and started with the Toasted Ravioli's. It's a must get app. The jalapeno cheese inside is perfect.  Then we had the big rig with meatballs and the chicken artichoke lasagne. The big rig still stands as my favorite pasta dish (I like it best with chicken for the health factor, although the meatballs are great). The chicken lasagne is absolutely phenomenal - so much flavor, cheese and chicken. If it wasn't a heart attack I could have it once a week.   We splurged and finished with the pizzokie...big yummy soft choc chip/white chocolate macadamia cookie covered in ice cream. One of my favorite desserts ever.

    "text": "I normally love this place, but it's clear that service standards have gone downhill.  Today, my wife and I intentionally planned a late lunch at Oregano's to avoid the rush.  We were quickly seated since there weren't many people there, and ordered a large margherita pizza with light cheese, extra sauce, and two garden salads.  We made a point of ordering with their light balsamic dressing to avoid added sugar, as my wife has a medical condition.   I opened my wrapped silverware to find leftover food caked and dried to the knife.  I asked the waiter for a replacement set, and while he did get it, he didn't say a word; just dropped the new ones and  walked off.  As the waiter left, and I suggested my wife check her silverware also.  It was a good thing I did, as hers was easily three times worse.  I couldn't believe the dishwasher did such a poor job and didn't catch this problem, and neither did the person who wrapped the silverware!  Inexcusable. Our salads arrived and were great, but I noticed my dressing had normal consistency, but my wife's was extremely thick, like chocolate pudding.  When our pizza arrived, we asked the girl who brought it what the difference was in the dressings, since we had ordered the same thing as one another.  \"Oh, the one your wife had is our HONEY BASIL,\" she said.  WTF?!! So, great, now we have to race home and monitor her sugar levels and possibly make a trip to the ER.  We pointed out this problem and that we'd specifically ordered things to avoid this, asking them to wrap up our pizza to go since we couldn't sit there waiting to see how she'd react.  All this time, not one person said \"I'm sorry,\" or \"Oh my gosh, we are so sorry for this!\"   The waiter rang up our order and presented us with the check, but didn't say a word or even make eye contact.  Seriously, this guy, from start to finish, couldn't have been more disinterested in his customers If he tried.  We paid and left, but as we walked out I did bring this to the attention of one of the managers, Nicole, and thankfully she at least apologized for what occurred and said to ask for her next time we're in.  Not sure there will be a next time, but we'll see.  Plenty of training opportunities here, Oregano's - I sure hope you guys can turn this place around.",

They load the small size up with a ton of chicken and good feta and the red onions that are marinated in something and a surprise is the raisins and red peppers. It appears that you won't be able to finish the salad, but the honey vinagerette is really light and any real man should be able to avoid the to-go box on this puppy. Maybe including a piece of garlic toast would be great. Nice outdoor patio at this location and part of bar is fully outside. I think my other reviews are from wrong location when I just moved out here, but food is the same at all locations basically. I grabbed a fortune cookie and I either ate the fortune or I got a dud, very weird. About $10 for the meal.",

We were the first ones to sit in the \"inside\" main dining area.....3 more tables arrived within a 15-20 minute timeframe after that.  We ordered pizza.  The table behind us got there food.  An appetizer which had to go thru the oven.  The other table behind us got their sandwiches.  All this time we are seeing a pizza sit by the food pick up area.  The table next to us got their wine, but we watched our server look at the ticket on the pizza with wine and glasses all in one hand and proceed to deliver and open the bottle of wine which he was struggling to do.  Another person sat another table and again walked by the pizza.  I finally got up to see if it was ours and sure enough it was!   Finally a girl brought it over all happy about delivering it.  Well we told her we didn't want it as it was sitting for at least 15 minutes....She said it was under a heat lamp....YOU DON\"T LEAVE PIZZA UNDER A LAMP FOR THAT LONG!  She asked if I wanted to take a piece to see if it was still hot.  It was just okay and she offered a new one.  Well they made a new one and now it looked like they rushed it as the cheese was lightly melted no browning on top.  It looked bad!  the new young manager offered to buy the food and make another one.  We were already there over one hour and still hadn't eaten.  I said no we aren't waiting for another and left.  The piece of pizza that I tasted was so thin it was pathetic and tasted that burnt flavor for which it was on the edges.  This was my final time going here....funny we went some where else to eat and the people next to us told us about a problem they had at the Cactus rd location ...they aren't going back either.  This establishment has really gone bad and downhill and is very over rated.....PIZZA HUT is much better than they are believe it or not!  Don't waste your time here....",

The waitstaff all have cute sayings on the back of their shirts (Legalize Marinara) and we were greeted by multiple people. Our dessert was out of this world. Soft, gooey, melty, delicious humongous chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. My mouth is watering.",

When I showed the waitress she looked terrified and tried to make up some excuse that it came from the keg, when clearly we could see what took place here. Later the manager came over and apologized as he was shocked. I had already consumed most of the vile beer before looking into the infectious glass. Oregano's you should be ashamed.

    "text": "Finally went to eat here after hearing about it over and over and over again from co-workers.  My husband and I went around 6pm on a Sat. and we waited approx. 30 minutes for a table.  This was one of the more pleasant waits at a restaurant that I have ever experienced.    With plenty of seating around the bar, we were immediately approached by a friendly waitress who had our drinks back to us lickety-split.   I had the house Chianti, and the hubby had a Fat-Tire.    We got a nice booth inside and had another friendly waiter who brought us samples of the house Sangria which I also ordered.  It was pretty tasty, not out of this world, but it was cold and refreshing.  We got the boom dip which was excellent and the Chicago style pizza.  The 10 inch is way more than enough for two people. Two things about this pizza, 1) The crust is buttery, crisp and delicious.  2)  The sauce had a little too much basil for my taste, but they are very generous with the cheese and other toppings.  We walked out of there with lots of left-overs.    We did try the cookie dessert and it was tasty, but again, not out of this world.  I think a little less ice cream, and a little more cookie would be better.    Overall, I would go back here, and maybe see this as a good place to take out of town guests (with the exception of the long waits).  The atmosphere is nice, great friendly staff, and good food.",

The staff was very attentive, fast and courteous.  We had several different pizzas, 2 types of salad and a rigatoni pasta dish. As the name suggests, all the food here is heavy on the herbs and spices. Everything I had was delicious (and I had a bit of everything :)). Dessert was the best part (of course). We each were served individual cups with a half baked cookie and vanilla ice cream on top- I highly recommend trying this! I like the atmosphere of this restaurant and the interesting decor. The private room was perfect for any celebration or business meeting. They have a flat screen tv that can be used for presentations, but for the dinner I attended we did not need it.  The only downside to the private room was they did not have cable on the tv, so we could not watch the basketball game that was on. That wasn't a big deal for us though.",

Luckily for us, their waiting area was more like an outdoor lounge. We were able grab a drink at the bar and sit outside while we waited for our table. The wait actually went by pretty fast as we didn't even get to finish our drink before being seated.   The waiter was great and super helpful. We got the antipasto salad to start, it was HUGE. We felt like we ate so much of it and it barely made a dent! Since we both like different pizzas, we were able to get half of each kind and they were both fabulous. We had the bbq chicken and the meat trio. Delish! We will definitely be back when we return to the Scottsdale area!",

First off, when the host sat me down at the table it wasn't even properly prepared and their were crumbs on the seat. Our server was great, she wasn't the problem, she could've checked on us more and communicated about the late food but other than that she was fine.   I was just disappointed in the food I ordered. I ordered the garlic bread and a meatball sandwich.. the garlic bread had way too much garlic butter and the meatball sandwich bread was falling apart and it was the messiest Ive ever seen a restaurant sandwich, the meatballs were dry and not tasty at all. I ALWAYS get these two things at the old town location so I know what it's supposed to look and taste like. When I asked the manager why the meatball Sandwich was taking too long she said that the chefs put it in the oven to melt the cheese and the server put the order in later. Well I ordered both things at the same time and it was clear I didn't want them to come out so far apart. And to add the meatball sandwich took 20 minutes.. so after I was DONE the manager comes to the table DOES NOT EVEN STOP SHES STILL WALKING and says \"How is it tasting\" and I said fine and walks away. She sounded like she HAD to say that, didn't even sound genuine. At least pretend?! There was tension between the servers and the energy of the oreganos was quite disappointing and disturbing and the manager looked like she hated to be there.",

After waiting 35 minutes for the pizza to arrive, and numerous assurances from the staff after the 20-minute mark that it was coming out \"in a few minutes\", the pizza itself was an epic disappointment.  Seriously on par with a bad frozen pizza!  It was sliced in those silly small squares, which makes it awkward to handle.  The toppings easily slipped off when trying to take a bite or when cutting it with knife and fork, which leads to a generally poor pizza-eating experience, at a minimum, and a burned roof-of-mouth to boot.  The crust was thin and crispy throughout, something like an bad, unsalted saltine cracker.  Honestly I can't in my 45 years of eating pizza think of a worse restaurant pizza.  Two take-home messages here - poor service and historically bad pizza.  Wish I had gone to NYPD Pizza across the parking lot - no way could it have been nearly as bad.",

It took us almost an hour and a half just to be seated on a Tuesday night (after being told it would be an hour wait). Okay, not a good start.  But then even our waiter was terribly slow.  Took 20 minutes to even get us drinks on our table.  Food came out really slowly, luckily we had put in our order for the deep dish pizza while we waited, but even then our regular pizza took forever to come out.  The food was good, especially the pizza cookie, but to spend 3 hours at a pizza place where we gave our ENTIRE order to the waiter at his first appearance (in hopes of making up some time) is just too long.  I think this is a management problem, as I could tell our waiter was working his tail off, but just couldn't seem to keep up.   Worst part? After waiting an hour and a half to be seated, our table was dirty (the floor) and it had a view into another section that was completely empty, must have just been closed for the night due to lack of staff.  Just hire some more people and open the restaurant up!",

Your manager handled it like a champ. Between the \"I used to work in a restaurant\" comments, \"I'm emailing corporate\" and other snide remarks of the family, he kept his friendly, professional demeanor. It was just sad to see a customer talk to one of your employees like that. I don't know what exactly the issue was but it was clear they were using the opportunity to intimidate the manager into giving them something. Again, your manager kept it cool.   As a customer who had a positive experience tonight- I can say I appreciate good managers.   This was Sunday night around 7pm on the patio/ takeout area. Manager was a guy with a beard. Good job man!",

The hostess was also very kind and helpful (Working 6:30 on 5/9, didn't get her name).   All the food was not only gorgeous but tasted amazing. For only $5 you get a GIANT cheesy garlic bread appetizer that feeds 2-3 people easily.  Ziti and chicken parm were exemplary and came out steaming hot-we were amazed how good everything tasted.  PB chocolate pizza cookie for dessert was so good...so so good...you must order a pizza cookie if you come to Oregano's. You wont be disappointed.  Our bill only came to $34... included a huge appetizer, 2 entrees so large we have 2 meals for tomorrow as well, and a dessert.   Will definitely be back- had a great dinner. A special thank you to Kaitlyn, again! Best waitress I've ever had. She was so kind. :)",

Always a winner! Shaved rib eye steak is literally piled high! The cotija cheese and the jalapeno dressing adds a good spice, and it's topped off with sweet grilled onions to balance it out. Yum!!  This place does get packed out quickly especially on the weekends. Note- They don't take reservations- so hangout on the nice patio and have a drink while you wait. You will have a great time!",

The wait was relatively short for a Saturday night, and the service was super attentive and friendly.  Best of all, the food was very good. Our kids decided this is their new favorite pizza place and they happen to like the thin crust. The adults really loved the deep dish. We also had a few pasta dishes at the table including the lasagna and the bowl of pasta that is \"all you can eat.\" Everything was delicious.  They also listed the calories in the menu, which was helpful for me to make better food choices. The kids ended the evening with their famous Pizookie which is the cookie in a pizza pan with ice cream on top. It is outstanding, you have to save room for this dessert... our kids loved it.  We will definitely be back here, and I'm so glad we found another place in the neighborhood our kids like to eat.",

What a disgusting pizza it was. I asked for the manager he said this is the way their pizza looks now and gave me a song and dance about how it's made different times of the yr. There was next to zero sauce as you can see in the picture. Told him if that's their new pizza I'm done going there after all these yrs. He did say he'd bring me some sauce, just crap. All this manager had to say is it was made wrong and bring me one made right, instead he gave me a song and dance about sauce, he comp the pizza, I paid for my beer(didn't comp that,duh) and gone never to eat that garbage again!",

In a place with 50+ items on the menu, there's bound to be some duds and stars. For the price, I was pleasantly surprised to see 6 decent-sized shrimp on the plate.  The Diablo was no joke. Slightly spicy to start, building slowly.    With a sandwich, I preferred the house-made chips over the sweet potato fries as the side.    If you order the garlic bread appetizer, I highly suggest adding the cheese.  Not a place to go if you're counting or reducing carbs. Seriously, the Chicken Parm entre is 2200 calories and they serve the Baked Pasta in a bread bowl.    Go here if you want to go big at not-so-big prices.",

    "text": "The food was ok. I ordered the Lady Scampi which was described to have 12 large shrimp with noodles.  There were only 6 and the portion of noodles could have served 4 people.  I was very disappointed.  But the dish was good.   I just had to leave most of the pasta because who wants to eat a boat of pasta for lunch?   My family ordered the thin pizza with two meat toppings as their second choice because their pan pizza would have taken 45 minutes.  We should have just ordered that because our food took about that long to come out. But it was because it sat under the warmer for a while.  I watched it sit there wondering why food would sit for so long and then I see our server pick it up and delivery it to us.  The kids,  who will eat just about any pizza did not like it and we ended up having to eat at jack in the box later because they were still hungry.   Our server was very nice though.   The Bollo sausage and the two apps we ordered (fried zuchinni and garlic bread) were good.  The sausage I really liked.  Or was very flavorful and spicy.   There was not much room for our group of 5 so we had to sit in a booth and add a chair.  Found out there's another building across the patio that may have been better but who knows,  no one told us where to sit because everyone was too busy.  Bathrooms are outside Ahmed or was in the high 30s when we'r visited,  and rainy,  so was not fond of having to walk out to UAE the potty.  Overall,  we would choose to try a different restaurant if we had a choice but wouldn't cry if we were forced to eat there.",

    "text": "Folks if you're reading this, come only if you're super hungry as the portions are HUGE. Came here today for a Sunday lunch and wasn't prepared for how big these portions were going to be. Place wasn't slammed for lunch as it was after 2PM but there were about a dozen diners eating and only one waitress in our area.  Started with a Kale Caesar salad which was very generous in servings. We didn't add the chicken to the salad as we had big pasta dishes coming. The salad was amazing, it was HEARTY, meaning that not only was enough for two people but we had enough to take home for a second helping. The salad was coated nicely with a very light caesar dressing and the kale wasn't crispy nor soggy, it was just right. There was a nice amount of parmesan shavings on it, raisins sprinkled throughout and also tiny circular pieces of friend mozzarella cheese. The whole thing just worked. Absolutely delicious.  After 15 minutes the main entrees came and boy was it large. I already knew that we would be taking a doggie bag as the servings seemed like twice what you would get at an Olive Garden. My hubby ordered Chicken Parmesan and for me the Chicken Garlic Lasagna. My hubby's order came out piping hot and for some reason my lasagna came out lukewarm and the cheese toast cold. That right there was s strike as I have a thing about food being served hot.  So since my lasagna didn't come out steaming hot like my husband's food, I lost interest in eating it. Rather then sending it back, I forked a couple bites and then just wrapped it to go hoping that it would taste good for another meal. As far as my husband's meal he really liked his chicken parmesan dish. I took a bite of his food to get a taste but after one small bite I felt it was too salty.  The experience overall with food quantity was good and service was ok, I believe we'll come back another time to try the pizzas and the lunch specials.",

No finesse, character.  meatball was tolerable if not for the awful sauce. seems like when we arrived four years ago the fare was better.  definitely like pizzas, now can't choke em down.  What have you become Oreganos?  Just good enuf for your audience.  You should be ashamed to serve crap like this.  I've given you guys many chances, complained to manager etc.  My guess is you guys have somehow streamlined the process.  It's backfired for me.  I think, two or three years ago you were better.",

The delivery food truck was running late. The owner made it alright by giving us a gift card to come back. I wasn't mad, and he definitely didn't have to do that. Some things are out of our control.

My wife and I would like to personally thank the owner, Mark Russell for FINALLY changing the music to a milder Pandora station. For years it's been a continuous loop of the same loud Italian music over and over. We could tell how long we've been here by the song that was playing. All the employees are ecstatic, also. Now our favorite restaurant is PERFECT!!!  Thank you, Mark The Regulars",

Not a long wait either, but in the past I have found that it gets pretty busy and having a wait time isn't uncommon! The atmosphere is also fun. Fun music and lots too look at.

She asked for my contact info to send a gift card -- what great, Yelpy etiquette! And when we came back in it was great to be back. The service and food were amazing and I remembered why I became such a huge Oregano's addict in the first place, (mouthwatering food and fun atmosphere).  You know what they say about customers who have an issue: if you show you care and try to make it right they'll be your most satisfied, loyal customers ever in the future. Having said that, Oregano's and I are officially back together. And to quote Peaches and Herb (yup, that's a real band name), we're \"reunited and it feels so good,\" but mostly, tastes SO good.

It came with paper plates, plastic silverware, napkins, and parmesan cheese and crushed red peppers.  When I opened the box the pizza looked incredible!  However, there was one MAJOR problem....the pizza had not been cut.  In normal situations, it wouldn't be a big deal because I could just use my own pizza cutter.  But, I was helping a friend move into his house, and he didn't know where his pizza cutter was.  So, we had to basically use plastic knives to try to cut pieces and pull it apart.  I would have given 5 stars on the pizza, but sending out a deep dish pizza without cutting into slices is just unacceptable.  .",

    "text": "I love Oregano's so much. It has always been the go-to for our family birthday dinners. Everything about it is amazing, from the decor to the pizza to the pizza cookies!   The restaurant is old-timey Chicago themed, with jazz music wafting through the background, black and white televisions showing old films, and other random memorabilia on display. The tables and walls are decorated with old newspaper headlines, advertisements, and magazine covers. I always like the poster of Charles P. Thompson hanging by the bathroom advertising some 1950s tomato sauce.   And of course, the pizza is pretty good. The pan pizza is a True deep dish style Chicago pizza, but it takes like 30 minutes or more so it's not something for the impatient. I'm not a huge fan of thin crust pizza in general, but if we're too hungry to wait for the pan pizza we'll get thin crust instead and still enjoy it. Now that Lou Malnati's opened in Phoenix I'm less inclined to get the pan pizza at Oregano's.   But aside from all that, my all time favorite thing at Oregano's is the chocolate chip pizza cookie (aka Pizookie but they can't call it that because trademarks). I don't know what they do differently but the pizza cookie is better than anywhere else I've ever had. It's half-baked to the perfect level of doughiness and the chocolate is perfectly rich. I used to live 3 minutes away from the Tempe location and I would legitimately order the pizza cookie for takeout on a weekly basis because I loved it so much.    Some final tips:  - the closest bathroom is in the building on the right when you walk in, so keep that in mind when choosing your seat.  - the salad portions are enormous. Beware.  - get the pizza cookie. It's free if it's your birthday *wink wink*",

Thankfully, I checked in on Yelp to reserve my table, asking for seating for 5 plus a high chair. We were put at a booth that sits 4 adults comfortably and the high chair was in the walkway. I literally ended up standing to eat because it was better than sitting halfway in the booth.   Our server's section was quickly filled in less than 10 minutes. Clearly not a great move by the hostesses. Lindsey (I think that was her name) did her best to provide good service, but the kitchen didn't help at all in this. The kitchen was either understaffed or is way too small to handle a restaurant that size. Our food came out after about 30 minutes, but our salads didn't come out until we were finished with our pastas. I'm not sure why the salads took so long (Caesar and a House). One dish was missing the chicken it was ordered with, and it took about 20 minutes to get a glass of wine.   Considering the mishap with the order and the fact the salads took so long to come out, I would've thought the manager would come to our table to apologize for the mistake. I saw him walking around, but he never once stopped at any of the tables. Not the best in customer service.",

This was served on long toasts that you piled yourself with the tomatoes. Very good! The calamari was in strips which was new to me. It was tender, fresh and tasty served with a warm marinara.

The atmosphere is super cozy, gives you a feeling you are in a traditional spot in Italy. (Patio specifically)  I usually go for the thin crust, but i peaked at other plates and they look amazing.  The specialty pizzas I have tried so far were Puerto Penasco Carne and Yahoo BBQ chicken. Both are delicious, but personally prefer more simple ones.   Definitely a spot to try it out!

Years ago I worked my way up to manager of a high-volume pizza restaurant. I understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency of product.   We finally got an average, at best, One-O pie. We also had tried the Barbecue Chicken thin crust. Both were lacking in sauce and thus were dry to taste. We were surprised.  The Shea Oregano's is a well-run operation. The quality of product has been 5-Star over the years. We assume we just had a bad outing so we'll give them another shot.",

Drove, parked, walked to the hostess podium, and we were happy to see that there was no one waiting and I saw tables empty inside. We however were told there would be a 20 minute wait. The waiting area is in the outside courtyard. It was 107. Big fail. Wow. We have walked away when there was a line wait, but never like this.  Honestly, the food is really good, service is good. But it's always too busy. Maybe it's not managed well or something.  A week ago I ordered food online for pickup in an hour. Was there early and still waited 20 minutes past the hour I anticipated to wait. Then the incident today. Done. Maybe I can find a smaller Italian restaurant that will make me feel like I am at home rather than make me want to stay at home.",

I had the monster slice of pizza, plain cheese, off the lunch menu, along with the stuffed Portobello mushrooms.  The \"slice\" was actually 2 slices, perfect crust with ample gooey cheese.  And those mushrooms were unlike anything I've had: 2 giant Portobello caps stuffed with their homemade sausage, sauce, and topped with cheese, baked to perfection.

Then, when down in Tucson for a weekend, we found out we were staying near an Oregano's restaurant. Because of a tennis tournament, we were eating at odd hours, so we got in Oregano's easily on the off-meal hours. We fell in love with the Pablo Picasso salad. The large salad is about enough for two if you don't want to be stuffed. The pan pizza we had was also worth the wait.  In our new home, we are only a few blocks away from Oregano's at Scottsdale and Shea. Now, we just call in an order for a large Pablo Picasso salad and drive up and pick it up within 20 minutes. They often have pizza samples for people waiting for tables. They also offer you a free soft drink when waiting for a take-out order. So, we get a salad for dinner for two to eat at home for $11.

The staff at this location are pleasant and the service is good, but it is not the same. They take your order and bring your food but no small talk with the customers in general. The crowd was not what you would expect either. It was neither the North Scottsdale Snobs, nor the Gay feel of Camelback.  It was a strange mix of families with kids and older (over 30, not that that is old, just comparing) couples. The food and service was good, but the place was small. My one beef would have to be the bathrooms. They should make all their bathrooms unisex since they only have on male and one female, but this location actually has a baby changing station and I waited for about 20 min while a guy changed his kids diaper. Not so much a big deal (Do you really want to bring kids to a bar though???) if the bathrooms were unisex. Love it since it is Oregano's but not the same as Camelback.",

    "text": "While visiting Phoenix over the holidays, I mentioned I was turkey'd out and could use a good pizza.  Friends immediately said we had to go to Oregano's for a Grandma G's?!  We arrived and I was skeptical, the restaurant was filled with tons of tchotske, but the staff quickly won me over with their friendly enthusiasm and attention.  So, we had to get \"the  usual\" - Oregano's favorite salad, Grandma G's pizza, and the BIG cookie.  I was in, but remained suspicious.  The food is HUGE...and shockingly, good!  The salad easily fed the four of us and was not swimming in dressing as I was expecting.  Off to a good start.  Then the pizza came...did I mention that the food is BIG?  First you have to adjust your thinking from pizza to flatbread.  Once you're there, the cornucopia of ingredients in the G'ma G's isn't overwhelming - garlic chicken, tomatoes, gorgonzola, havarti and other cheeses, potatoes, caramelized onions and fresh rosemary.  Wow, it was completely addicting - the flavors melded and didn't clash and the crust was like a crip cracker (I heated the leftovers up in a frying pan the next day for breakfast - deeeelish!).  OK, so at this point we didn't really have room for anything else, but we ordered the BIG COOKIE (YUM!).  We went with the peanut butter chocolate cookie, which is barely baked to warm, gooey amazingness and then topped with scoops and scoops of ice cream.  WOW.  I would go back just for the cookie and almost made my hubby stop by for one 'to go' as we headed out of town.    PS: There was no wait the day I visited.",

The wait was definitely worth it, we were served beers on the bench in the waiting area so the time passed by pretty fast. We started off with the italian sausage stuffed mushrooms. The sausage was spiced perfectly. Very good. For our main course we had the cajun chicken pesto thin crust and the veggie sandwich. The pizza was good, not much cajun flavor but well done. The veggie sandwich was out of this world good. The goat cheese and red pepper aioli made it outstanding. We then went to the hot cookie desert. Ridiculous. Save room for it. Next time I'm hoping to try one of the stuffed pizzas and the picasso salad. Can't wait!",

    "text": "oregano's i'm so so so so sorry that i tend to overlook you.  never again.  i promise.    oregano's has never let me  down.  well, once, but it's because i forgot they used fresh parmesan.  so when they asked if we wanted parmesan, i said  \"yes\"  and then was mortified when instead of a shaker of powder, there was fresh parmesan sprinkled  all over my pizza.  i like fresh parmesan on my pasta, but for some reason  i think it ruins a pizza.  this is a personal thing, so i can't hold it  against them.  i absolutely love that oregano's makes the patio the focal  point of the restaurant.  even in the summer when it's deathly hot, they somehow manage to make the patio appealing.  the misters cool it down, but don't turn the patio into a swamp.     the last time we went i was STARVING after  a very very long day that i may or may not have complely forgotten to eat.  by the time we arrived, the wait was 30 min. for 2 people *sigh*.  (there had been a sign outside NYPD pizza boasting no wait and my belly was tempted).  \"no\" i reminded myself \"oreganos always has a wait and it's  always worth it.\"   the host told us that we  could sit at the bar if there was room and just to let him know if we found a spot and wanted to stay there.  so we  went to the bar, but it was pretty busy and there weren't 2 seats together.  the bartender offered  to move another chair around and a very nice couple said they could move down.  the bartender then took care  of taking us off of the list, which was nice.  the word \"hospitality\" came to mind (what a novel idea in the industry....)  i eyeballed a margarita and my hungry thirsty belly did a little dance.  i never would have considered getting a margarita here, but i'm so very glad i did.  it was quite possibly one of the best margaritas i've ever had.   great beverage, check!  knowing full-well that the pizza would take a good 30-45 minutes to come out i knew i had  to have an appetizer.  the calamari is always good, but i wanted something else.  once again, i ventured out of my comfort zone and remembering that once upon a time someone had told me the toasted ravioli were good, ordered those.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Foh.my&s=276e2ebc350073d2f8621da53e522ee7e0b3af05e71440977ab5e373881b8943\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">oh.my</a>.goodness!!! the cheese was sooooo soft.  it was  like liquid gold.  i forgot to share and actually ended up scarfing most of the ravioli down.  amazing appetizer, check!  then the pizza came and it was scrumptious! (as i have come to expect)  however, they forgot to put pepperoni on it. BUMMER!  and it's not like they can just fire another one up really quick.  however, the bartender went and got  us some pepperoni -- not the cold handful, here's your damn pepperoni, now you can't complain stuff, but they actually heated the pepperoni up and it was  a PLATEFULL, so it wasn't QUITE the same, but pretty darn close! fixing an order-gone-wrong, check! (although it would have  been an added bonus to have a manager address the problem  with the customer.  but that's just me.)  i want to give it 5 stars, but i just can't. not yet.  i need to have a few  more amazing experiences there and then i'll probably bump it up.",

Initially, our waitress was prompt with bringing beverages out. However, after our meal was delivered, our waitress disappeared; we never see her again. We inquire to another waiter, who then lets us know that our waitress had taken a break.   Nonetheless, the food was good. My four favorites are the \"Italian Gold wings,\" \"Numero One-O,\" \"Bistro Sweet Po's,\" and French Fries.   The Italian Gold wings are chicken wings cooked with a honey mustard BBQ sauce. The Numero One-O is a stuffed pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and green onions.   The Bistro Sweet Po's are sweet potato fries. And as for the French Fries, they are crispy and ruffled!   Oh yes, and DO try the dessert. I recommend the Chocolate Chip dessert, which is essentially a hot pizza cookie -- made entirely of chocolate chip.   Prices from about $5 to $9 for appetizers. Pizza prices range from about $14 to $23.   There are also lasagnas, pastas, and sandwiches -- all of which are good.",

The pizza is definitely the highlight, Problem was that it was too huge, including the goofy oversized menu that hit my partner in the head all the way across the table. -Pricing: pretty good. some things were high, some were low, but all in all i have to say pretty darn good for the portions. -Portions:  We had the garlic cheese bread, awesome and HUGE - almost too huge though for an appetizer, to the point where it filled me up too much and i could barely finish my pizza!  The pizza, as well, was HUGEEE (we got the chicago style - DO NOT get appetizers if you are getting a chicago style because you WILL NOT finish it, or even come close, be happy with pizza for the next week).  On the other hand, we also got the \"zany zitti\" which was... well pathetic.  Small and unsatisfying, served in a bread bowl, and i mean cmon how many carbs can one person have???  The flavors were boring as well - not something i would ever recommend, being i've made better at home from a box. -Flavors: Not bad, but not special.  not surprising - so in my opinion, therefore not interesting.  All in all - if my guy wanted to go back for the good pizza, i'd be ok with it, but its definitely not a place i'd drag my friends to on a good thursday night.",

My husband and I had heard wonderful things about Oregano's throughout the years (we've lived in Phoenix 22 years) and decided we had to finally try Oregano's Pizza. We pride ourselves on being \"foodies\" and our moto is you have to give a place at least three trys. Our order consisted of a Greek Salad, one thin crust pizza and one deep dish pizza. The salad was ok, nothing memorable, but not too bad. The deep dish was fair, could have used more cheese but did have a good buttery flavor in the crust. The thin crust, however, was a disaster. It was like eating cardboard. Tough, chewy and flavorless. I think I'm still trying to digest it.   I won't be able to stick to my \"three try rule\"  at this place.  If you're craving a good pizza try Grimaldi's.",

    "text": "Originally from Elmhurst, IL (a suburb of Chicago), I grew up loving thin, crisp pizza with lots of cheese, sausage and pepperoni.  I know, many people from Chicago are all about the deep dish but not me.  No matter what your preference, you can get it. From thin & crispy to stuffed or deep dish.  I hear their salads are fabulous but if I am at Oregano's I MUST have pizza.  We moved to the Phoenix area 15 years ago and I'd about given up on finding a good pizza....and then someone told us about Oregano's.  My world changed.  This is absolutely the BEST pizza I've ever tasted.  We've gone to several locations and they are consistently fabulous!   Expect a wait unless you go at an odd time - like 2 p.m. but it is so worth it.   Jeannie",

It's good, don't get me wrong, but I don't think everyone prefers thin crust over a standard crust.  The Chicago stuffed pizza is freaking huge, and it takes a while too! Considering there's a wait no matter what time I come, there's an option to order a stuffed pizza to cook while you wait. It's really nice because the pizza is ready as soon as we sit down!  I think the sweet potato fries are really good, slight hint of spices give a needed kick. Also the calamari's great. It's crispy but not oily.  And they have pizookies. I don't think anyone can really contest gooey cookie in a pan with ice cream on top.  Service is pretty friendly, but I don't think this restaurant is good at accommodating huge groups. The tables can't really take more than 6-8 at most, and they're either booths are round tables, not the kind you can squeeze together.  If your party is small and you crave Italian, nothing wrong with Oregano's.",

When offered the lunch side I was concerned it would be tiny, but maybe that would have been the way to go. Although I was able to save half of my regular size to eat the next day for lunch - yum! If you love Antipasto salads (my favorite) definitely give this a go. I thought I grabbed a crouton and it turned out to by a tiny delicious fried mozzarella ball! The Italian dressing was meh, I personally like Brothers Pizza dressing better but this salad was so hearty that you didn't need dressing anyways. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was when I ordered to go I was told 10 minutes and when I arrived 15 minutes later, I then had to wait another 7(ish) minutes before my salad was ready. Other than that, great experience! Next time I plan to sit and eat at the restaurant :)",

We also had a fantastic waitress who was helpful and informative. The pizza took close to an hour to cook, which they let you know upfront, which was fine by us. The portions are large which is nice if you have a few people with you. We were surprised by how large the salad was.  The only issue I had was the pizza was \"soupy'. Overall it was good, but when we would take a slice out of the pizza the void would fill in, which was sort of off putting. I could've used a little less cheese as well. I thought the crust was really good and made the pizza unique, but the overloading of cheese made the bottom of the crust hard to find and taste at times.",

It's a really neat setup - huge outdoor patio with seating and bar, plus waiting area.  Then a building with a smaller, cozier indoor seating section.  There are tons of neat, old-timey decorations, including old movie/ ad posters.  The colors are mostly red and green, and it all comes together nicely in every Oregano's, including this one.  We ordered an 18\" thin crust Sproccolli, which lasted for two meals for us.  The crust is super thin and the ingredients are spread over it lighty.  The flavors are wonderful - just a little sauce, cheese, topping, garlic, etc. - making each bite light and tasty, but still filling.  It's pretty delicious cold, too.  Can't wait to try the thicker pizza, too!  The service has always been really outstanding, in my experience.  I joke that, at Oregano's, they always treat you like they just found out you're Yelp Elite (even though I've been coming here since before I learned about Yelp).",

The salad was simple but delicious: just enough croutons and cheese and not too much dressing. The potato pos had cinnamon dusted on them, which I loved. We ordered a pizza cookie for dessert and this place is awesome about customizing orders. Being with a group of people, you have different tastes and preferences so it was really nice that they could do half and half. We got half chocolate chip and half peanut butter chocolate.

    "text": "My family has been going to Oregano's since the 1st location in Tempe opened up.  It's absolutely our favorite place. The dough they give our kids to play with is a fun different change from other places.  The Boom Dip is fantastic! Pasta Basta is my favorite.  We love the idea of a smallish restaurant with great patios.  The wait is an issue most of the time but what does that tell you?  There wouldn't be a wait if it wasn't any good.  We have now traveled to almost all the locations just for fun! The ambiance is great at all we've been to.  We have out of town guests who always request a trip to Oregano's.  Here's a tip...there's a couple dishes that take 30-45 min. so order those while your waiting and it'll be ready once you get seated.",

All the food looks amazing but I always stick with ordering a pizza and wings.  The wings in the past have always been huge, cooked well, and the medium gold sauce is fabulous.  Last night, I ordered my usual and was so disappointed when the wings arrived.  They were small, half the size of what they were previously.  While the taste was still good, I was so bummed by the underwhelming size of the wings.   Come on Oreganos!!",

The service isn't bad, the atmosphere is nice.  But honestly, the food isn't that great (IMHO).   I've tried the Turkey Sub, the Chicken Fiesta Salad, the Italian Sausage Sub, the Margarita Pizza and others...nothing has impressed me.  I wonder if people love this place because they serve Cheesecake Factory-like servings (I've always had to take my food home in a doggy-bag).  It's about as faux pizza and Italian food as you can get.   Don't get sucked into the crowd-source mentality of friends raving about this place.   No way am I a fan of the food.  Period.",

We've been here more than 2 dozen times, and never had a bad experience.  Yes, you will have to wait up to an hour or more if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, or most nights during the peak (non-summer) season, but that should tell you something.  There is a reason why you have to wait an hour at Oregano's while the joint next door has a sandwich board sign out front proclaiming 'no wait here!'",

    "text": "This is a place I miss terribly ever since I moved away. I go at least three times during my week-long vacays back to Scottsdale, and I always order the exact same thing: Pablo Picasso salad, hold the cilantro, and a Pizzookie (chocolate chip, of course).   I've tried the pizza, the sandwiches, all of the apps, but these are the only two things that have me coming back. The dressing on the Picasso salad tastes like a delicious Mexican party in your mouth, and the salad itself has so many wonderful ingredients, including a very delicious, slightly spicy fajita chicken. There are FOUR different kinds of cheeses in here, and tomatoes, and chips. I. Love. This. Salad.  HOWEVER, I love pretty much nothing more in this universe (sorry, bf!) than the amazingness that is the pizzookie. I often dream about it, and wish I could replicate it in my own kitchen. Even other restaurants fail at making this dish perfect (I'm looking at you, BJ's and Boulders!). Oregano's excels and makes you want to eat this every day. I can never finish a whole one (and when I do, I feel sick but in the most satisfying way), so I usually share. I get pretty greedy and territorial, though, so watch out.  The service here is always very friendly and nice, and many of the male servers are very attractive (that's a nice bonus!). Prices are definitely on the cheaper side, and they have some new-ish options of making your salad a 'Junior' size for a few bucks less, and it's STILL a ton of food.  Bottom line, you have to try the Pizzookie. You may hate me later for the weight I made you gain from becoming addicted, but during those orgasmic moments when the warm, melty cookie is in your mouth, you'll be thanking me.",

It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much.

    "text": "Seriously! What is the deal with the wait at this place?!! I have been going to Oregano's for over ten years now (including the old town location) and like clockwork there is always at least a one hour wait.  It makes no difference if they add more patio room, expand into the building next door or even open up a brand new location 5 miles away at the PV Mall. There is always a agonizing wait! Of course - this isn't Oregano's fault. Unless they start taking reservations, raise prices, or botching the food I don't think there is anything they can do about how popular they are.   As far as the food goes, the menu is a kind of bastardized Italian. Nothing appears to be authentic unless you count the pizza as authentic NY style thin crust. Everything else  on the menu seems to have been put there to appeal to anyone on this planet who has ever uttered the phrase \"Damn I'm starving\". Or to put it a better way - if you are incredibly hungry Oregano's is without a doubt a 5 star restaurant. If you are a food snob , or on a diet, or if you rarely ever work up a healthy appetite you will probably not like it here. I always seem to be hungry and occasionally enjoy a giant plate of comfort food which is why I give Oregano's 5 stars.   Don't believe me?.... Try it for yourself. Fast all day until 6pm, then go to Oregano's, put your name on the list, sit there and watch the servers parade all that food past you for 90 minutes, then sit at your table and order a giant bowl of spaghetti and meatballs (bollo pasta). You should be in a sensational food coma by the end of the meal.",

This trip the waiter informed us that there was dairy in the marinara sauce....well just scratch the bulk of the menu for me.  Sure, Italian meals are heavily based around cheese, but there are very few other options on the menu as an entree.  Everyone else walked away happy...so I'm the odd man out.  I was in the mood for pasta and walked away only sampling guacamole, garlic bread, and nibbled on some sweet potatoes fries.

Everything is huge but that's okay because then you always have leftovers. And then there's the trademarked pizza cookie. Lots of places try to copy it but they all fail against oreganos! Try half macadamia nut, half chocolate chip..but order it before you're done eating dinner...a. It takes awhile to cook and b. You might change your mind if you don't because you'll be so stuffed!",

I could barely find what looked like a small, pounded half of a chicken breast under the   mound of mozzarella.  More cheese than chicken, by a fair margin.  On the up side, the employees were their usual happy selves, and that is one reason to go to this location.  I am usually a big fan of the food, but maybe I hit the one menu item that does not live up to the hype.  Love the Big Rig, love the pizza, Chicken Parm pasta....take it or leave it.  I chose the latter.",

Yes, we had to wait 45 min for a table in the hot patio, no biggie.  Then, we sat down in these super long booths that was hard to get out of with tons of people going up & down the narrow walkway.    We order a 18\" thin crust pizza (since I was burn with a pan pizza last time), salad, bread sticks, chicken wings and a kids' meal.  Waited about 30 minutes with no food.  So I ask our waitress if we can have the salad & kids' meal now.  She said she had to check w/ the kitchen.  She comes back and told me no b/c they were together...what?!!?!  15 min later she brings out the bread sticks & kids meal.  Then the pizza, salad & wing.  What the hell is wrong w/ their expediting?!?!  The only dish that was decent was the Big Beefstro Salad.  Thin crust was a big disappointment.  3 strikes is enough for me.  Will not be coming back anytime soon.",

Too cheesy and my intuition says it is not a blend of cheeses (just mozz) making for a oily one-dimensional pie.  Crust is week, without flavor and cannot hold up to the amount of cheese on the pie.  Sauce is unremarkable.  If you are used to Chicago stuffed pizza (My Pie, Gino's, Lou's, Burt's etc) you will be VERY disappointed.  I hear that the thin crust is better.",

We arrived a little before 11:00 a.m. and both ordered a slice of pizza and didn't get served until 11:36 a.m. We watched as orders \"to go\" were being boxed before the orders for in-house customers were served. Hey Oregano's - The changes that have been made in the past year, such as charges for fries with sandwiches and loss of focaccia bread, were disappointing but understandable. The outrageously bad management today really isn't.",

I moved away from Phoenix almost ten years ago and I STILL think about this food.   Granted, sometimes Oregano's can get packed - it is a popular place, after all - but I've almost always found it worth the wait. The ambience is really fun and kitschy, and the soundtrack they have playing really adds to the fun experience too. They offer a lot of different options for you, be it pizzas, pastas, salads, or sandwiches (I love just about anything with their Cajun chicken on it). Obviously you have to have a pizookie afterwards too (if you have to ask, just order one and find out what heaven tastes like).   If I seem a little fanatic, so be it - this place is an all time favorite for many locals, myself included! If you're still wondering if you should check it out or not, just go - and could you bring me back a half peanut butter half chocolate chip pizookie while you're at it? :)",

We were too hungry to wait that night but based on the smell, the atmosphere, ambiance and the line of all ages and styles we vowed to be back.  Turns out our first experience would be the dine in sort rather take out. When I called I knew what I wanted...the * Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie *...  { Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow } does that give you A N Y idea how GOOD it was? I was actually worried about the 'pesto' when really it should be labeled magic sauce.   The flavor was on point. I am a HUGE cilantro fan and there was the perfect amount on the whole pie plus the crust stayed the perfect crispness through transport!!! When does that even happen?!??  Last but not least, when I made my phone order, the person was spot ON with the wait time/ready time whatevs. I got there 10 mins early because I hate it when my food sits...whelp it was ready in exactly 40 minutes like she said.  Long story NOT short....E A T * H E R E !!!!  I will order take out again and I will definitely be having a dine in experience in the nearish future.  *cheers*",

Used no wait app for our party of 6 and was told to check in at 6:05 pm which I did and was told it wouldn't be too long. 20 minutes later I was told there was 1 party ahead of us. 40 minutes later I was told the table we were to be given had people there an hour with no food yet. We offered to split our party if that would help get us seated faster but was told that wouldn't work either. No real apologies,  it just is what it is he basically said. So why use no wait? Ended up going across the street to Hop Daddy and we were in and out in less than an hour and the  food and service were great! Almost missed the movie due to Oreganos!",

People at every table are swatting and waving them off their faces and tables. I could not even eat my food because I could only imagine how many flies were in the kitchen if that many were in the dining area. After complaining that it didn't feel like the air conditioning was on, we were told it was but the oven and the door opening to the patio were just making it hot. Are you kidding?? The service was mediocre at best and it's hard to eat food even if it tastes good when it has flies landing in it throughout the meal. Very disappointed and won't be back.",

    "text": "For some reason, I had a ridiculous craving for Chicago style deep dish pizza.  Like almost a physical urge to eat that thick, gooey, filling style of pie.  So we found ourselves braving the crowds (we went at 5pm and there was an hour wait!) because folks said Oregano's had good deep dish pizza.    First, can I talk about the menu?  What is this, a theme restaurant in Vegas?  The person who wrote this menu should be stoned (and probably was when he wrote it) for all the terrible, chintzy, schlocky, names and descriptions of food.    Anyway, they do a pretty decent job of managing the crowd and getting folks drinks while they wait in the large, open patio area, and a table opened up soon enough.  We started with a large, family style salad which was mostly lettuce.  Then the pizza came, and it was everything I hoped it would be.  Sure, it's not Giordano's, but it was seriously the next best thing.  It was thick and gooey and exactly what I was looking for.  We had the numero one-o (sigh...) and the amount of toppings, and the pounds and pounds of cheese hit the right spot.  The crust was a little tough to get through with the butter knife provided, but that's my only complaint about the pizza.  It was even good as a thick cheese brick the next day.  So I'm going to take a star off for the seriously embarrassing menu, and for the fact that you cannot come here and not wait for a table, and the mediocre salad.  But that deep dish pizza is the real deal, far away from Chicago.",

Born and raised on the south side of Chicago but had spent the last 15 years in southern VA, I was looking for a taste of home.  I found it!  I had a thin crust cheese and sausage and it was just like home.  Not a sweet sauce (I am not a big fan of sweet sauce i.e. Palermo's on 95th).  I had not had Italian sausage like that since Chicago.  It was on point!!  I ate the whole dang pie...The thin crust was thinner than Chicago thin crust but they also have a pan and a stuffed if you don't care for the thin crust thing.  I can't wait to go back.  Service was great and a few 4 Peaks selections.....cant go wrong here.",

The staff is friendly and it is a warm, inviting atmosphere as an added bonus.   I discovered them when I first moved into town and ate from a catered lunch, catered for a several dozen employees.

But that doesn't mean Oregano's doesn't try to suck me into obesity every dang time I'm here. Warning: This review contains lots of yelling, because the food is INSANE.  But first I want to address my one complaint: The bathroom. WHY! Why must there only be one stall?! This place is on a wait circa 5:00 p.m. every night (including week nights), why must I almost pee my pants waiting for the one stall to be vacated?!!? And it's stuffy in there too. Wah.  (Oh yeah, another review talks about this too: WTF is up with the flies in the main room? There's always one buzzing around our table. The place seems clean so...I dunno.)  ONTO THE FOOD.  It's stupid. The portions, how tasty it is, all of it. It's just dumb. Favorites include:  -Deep dish Sproccoli pizza: Are you kidding me?! I could barely finish one piece, and it's not like I didn't want to eat more. I was just STUFFED. The thin crust ain't nothin' to sneeze at, either. And make sure they take the bucket-o-parm and sprinkle it over your pie. YUM.  -Guacatony: Why. Why do they need to over-stuff the large ramekin holding the Italian-herb-laced guacamole so it spills all over the crispy perfection of cheesy-toasty \"chips\"?! WHY?! Because they want me to weigh a deuce, that's why!!!!!  -The veggie sandwich: WHAT WAS THIS MONSTROSITY?! PILES of grilled veggies and cheese (Provolone AND goat cheese, who's counting?), basil, and since I don't dig aioli all that much I ordered a side of marinara to go with it for dipping. I am a sandwich bandit and I could only deal with half of it.   -Pesto Penne Bake: How is this? And why is this? Pesto pasta and sundried tomatoes and cheese BAKED INTO A BREAD BOWL WHY.   -Boyfriend's favorite salad on Earth is the Pablo Picasso salad. Also, a \"small\" version of this is roughly the size of a football field. I'm afraid of the regular-sized one. I fear it.  -The lunch \"slice\" (2 big slices) with their awesome house salad (homemade Italian dressing = savior) is a STEAL.  I'm faint just typing this all out. My love of Oregano's truly exhausts me. I think I need to make a trip soon to regain strength.",

My salad came out when my husband was on his second bowl if spaghetti. The reason given was there were alot if to go orders and the salad line was backed up. So...should I have ordered my salad to go to get it sooner? We were very disappointed. While we typically enjoy our time and food...not this time!

However, the restaurant is really dirty and for this reason I cannot give it more than two stars.  I have been to this location many, many times. More than 20. Each time I go there are flies EVERYWHERE. Even our server was embarrassed and tried to explain why there were flies (apparently it's because I was wearing perfume) and lit candles at 2:00PM to \"attract\" the flies. I spent most of my meal batting flies away from my food and hair. So gross.  After looking around for to figure out WHY there were flies I noticed just how filthy the restaurant is: there are splatters of what I assume is food on the blinds and a build up of what look like years of crumbs on the window sills, especially in the corners. (The booths that line the walls are next to windows). It was so gross I wouldn't have wanted to touch the blind cord to open the shades without a Clorex wipe. Ew. I can't believe that this popular of a restaurant doesn't take the time to wipe down their windows -- even just once a month.  I honestly don't think I will be back here anytime soon. I need to forget how grossed out I am before venturing back to this place. It very well could be that the flies were attracted to my perfume but if that's the case why am I never bothered by flies any where else?  On a positive note the service was great.   Seriously, just clean the place and find a way to fix the fly issue.",

We shared one of the simpler pizzas, just cheese, tomato, and basil, but nonetheless, it was delicious and hit the spot. Thin crust was perfectly crispy and had a good topping:cheese:sauce ratio. I also loved the hot chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert. It is apparently one of their specialities and, if I do say so myself, a must-get if you ever come by! Service is super friendly and their t-shirts have funny sayings on the back. Great place to get your pizza fix!",

You get massive amounts of food and a fun atmosphere.   I shudder to think of the calorie count, but portions are definitely meant for sharing.   Our server last night, Josh, was exceptional.   After a lengthy wait for a table (a very common experience....you'll probably wait around an hour), we were running late for a movie.  Josh did a great job of making sure we were out on time; he was prompt, professional, and personal.",

After one bite I sent the sandwich back. The waitor appologized and said they would be making me a fresh sandwich and that it was not supposed to be cold. I already knew this as I had just had this sandwich less than a week ago at their bell rd and 67th ave location (it was delicious there). The new sandwich comes out and it is hot so I dig in. First bite was much better but then back to cold eggplant. I look at the other half of the sandwich under the fries and behold, the original bite I had taken... So they did not remake the sandwich and just re-heated the whole thing. I gave them the opportunity to make it right the first time and they chose to give me back a reheated old sandwich vs making a new one with fresh ingredients.  You have now lost a customer.",

We had a pesto pizza, wongs wings (not on menu- you have to ask for them), stuffed mushrooms, italian sub, meatball sandwich and it was all great.

The reason why this wasn't a 5 star review is because we were placed by a large group of middle school- aged children (and they were being extremely loud and one scooted his chair out and almost ran into my mother)- the restaurant itself really couldn't do much since we were outside other than placing us at a different location or saying something to the kids. Our server was very friendly and empathetic to what was going on and brought us our pitcher of beer very quickly! Also, the misters were dripping all over us, our table, and our food.. it probably would've been a good idea to leave the umbrellas up even at night time since this occurred. We love Oregano's and plan on going back- probably best to sit inside though!!",

Oregano's falls under the good pizza category. And yes, the quality of the food is pretty much the same at each location, there are certain things that make this location stand out from say, the old town location.  Like easy parking. Getting a seat within 15 minutes. An abundance of outdoor seating (Old town has outdoor seating too, but Shea has more). Managers that come around to each table to make sure everything is cool.  Little things that make everything stand out.  Not all pizza is created equal. And for that matter, neither are Oregano's.",

    "text": "My nephew and I went to this \"Bistro\" yesterday around 3 pm and I was unbelievably disappointed. From the first encounter to the last it was all bad. I experienced bad attitudes throughout our meal. No one had genuine smiles on their faces and felt like I was a bother to most. It all started with the hostess who did not seem as though she wanted to be there and you could tell by the scowl on her face. Our waiter showed up and did not introduce himself just asked if we were ready to order. It is my belief that you should ask people if they have been to an establishment and offer guidance with the menu if you are calling yourself a \"Bistro\". Maybe even talk about specials if you have them. So I order mimosa and ask if we could have a bit more time given this is your first time in. When my mimosa arrives I'm less than pleased with the amount of fluid I see in my glass and say to the waiter who delivered it that it looked a little light. He put his hands up, shrugs and walks away doing nothing about my dissatisfaction. He must have told the women bartender because she came out not to apologize for the drink and make another one but to sneer at me. At this point I should have walked out but I didn't. Our waiter comes to take our order, we've decided to order the Chicago style pizza but he informed us it would take about 50 minutes to an hour so we declined and ordered the thin crust pizza on his recommendation. While we were waiting for our pizza we listen to the musical stylings of the hostess click her pen over and over and over again while she looks completely bored and uninterested in being there. Well 45 minutes later, our waiter comes by to tell us he has spoken to the manager the pizza would be out in an additional 5 minutes. Hmm I guess we could have ordered the Chicago style pizza after all. At this point I'm just ready for this to be over, so I do not complain. The pizza arrives and the flavor is not bad but for me it is a little runny and messy. 5 minutes after our food arrives I see the manager on her way over to our table and I'm thinking it's to see if we are ok given our food took over 50 minutes but this is not the case. It is to see if we wanted to have our pizza wrapped up to go! Well since I'm seated near the annoying hostess station (Looks like shift change because a new less than interested hostess is there clicking her pen now!) I know that there was a 10 top that needs to be filled so they wanted us to leave. About 3 minutes later our waiter does the same thing and I now concede. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone, just bad all around. Oregano's do better!",

    "text": "Sometimes there is such thing as too much of a good thing, in this case, greetings. Much like how Safeway grocery store now has this kind of forced pleasantries thing going, Oreganos is at it as well.  My coworker and I were greeted warmly by the nice host. Within the next two minutes, we were welcomed/greeted probably 23 times. I kept waiting to be asked if I was saved, or get a free copy of the watchtower. Please don't get me wrong, I love manners, they are great- like beer, but a little goes a looooong way.  My buddy and I order lunch, a couple of slices and cheesy garlic bread. I think I jinxed us, because I 'checked in' with my excitement about cheesy garlic bread, and the appetizer never arrived.   Our lunch arrived, and as we scan the table discover there is no silverware, napkins, etc. After waiting a few minutes our server shows up and sees that we have made no forward progress, and brings us our silverware, and made a comment about forgeting the silverware. Totally cool, and I thought he addressed it, but no harm done. The server then asks if we ever got our appetizer, and we told him we did not. His reply would have made sense if I told him the sun would rise tomorrow, \"Oh.\" Kind of matter of fact, but there was no attempt at service recovery, or making it right. I would have been really pleased with a \"Oh, sorry about that.\" or \"Can I buy you guys dessert?\" etc. Nope, didn't happen.  It is a good spot, and they are insanely busy during lunch, but I think it would be good for them to remember to pay attention to details, it is important.   The pizza was just ok, nothing to write home about. I think next time I will check out NYPD, they have great pie.",

The wait here is always about an hour long, And with their overrated pizza, a wait like that seems wrong.  I'm not a huge fan of their thin pizza crust, It tastes like saltine crackers, and that makes it a bust.  I think their deep dish crust is just A-OK, The dough is way to gummy, there's not much else to say.  They also load the pizza with disgusting wads of cheese, Even people from Chicago, this pizza cannot please.  They use shredded chicken as a pizza and salad topping, It tastes really dry, making their food less than showstopping.  All their salad portion sizes are so seriously huge, Piled high with extra toppings, their chef is far from a scrooge!  I wish they used some spinach as a main salad filler, But Instead they use iceberg lettuce and it's such a salad killer.   Everything on their dinner menu is priced just about right, But make sure to try their lunch menu if your wallet is tight.  Their restaurant atmosphere is very cheesy and fun, It exudes cute pizzeria characteristics that are nicely done.  It's just too bad that their interior is so small, Patrons look uncomfortably cramped and that's no fun at all.  Oreganos is mediocre just middle of the road, Don't eat too much of their monster sized portions or you might explode!  Their dishes are too large for me I never eat it all,  but with their charming restaurant atmosphere I always have a ball.",

We were seated immediately and the service was great and friendly, which isn't always the case when you show up to a restaurant at shift change.  We both had the dinner salad, which was fresh and had all the right toppings.  I had the Zany Ziti and my girl had the all you can eat bowl of pasta (not sure why since she's tiny and couldn't even finish one bowl, but I digress, lol) The food arrived a short time later.  Everything was hot and tasty.  Mine came in a bread bowl, which was a nice touch.  The garlic bread was delicious and crusty and plenty of butter and garlic, mmmmm. The marinara had a nice taste to it with a little kick. The surroundings are very welcoming and laid back, overall a very nice, relaxing environment.  We'll definitely be back, just wish there was one closer to us in the west valley.",

    "text": "This is one of the best casual dining experiences in Scottsdale. From the moment we walked in and were greeted by the friendly hostess, asking us were we wanted to sit, rather than plunking us down at the closest table. Our waiter, Matt, was exceptional. We let him know this was our first time dining at Oregano's so Matt took the time to explain what Oregano's is best known for in each category, appetizers, salads, pizza and pasta. We opted for the Antipasto salad, Jr., which was huge. My husband & I split the salad and then ordered the thin crust Margherita pizza; billed as Chicago style.  Being from Chicago, the thin crust lived up to the hype. The fresh tomatoes were perfect.  My husband (usually very reserved about a recommendation) admitted this was one of the best Antipasto salads ever.   We will definitely be back with friends and hopefully Matt will be working. After traveling across country, he is a stand-out in the restaurant industry and made our first dining experience at Oregano's an absolute pleasure. Can't wait to go back.",
