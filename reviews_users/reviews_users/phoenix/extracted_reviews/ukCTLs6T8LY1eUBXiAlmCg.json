    "text": "We really loved this place, and would frequent at least once a month (it was a bit of a drive for us), but Steak 44 has gone down hill the past year. The last few times we have eaten at Steak 44 the food has been less then average, and some of the employees who work there need to learn some etiquette. Our very last time we ate here I ordered the Sea Bass and it was raw when I cut it open. The waiter took it back and said he would get one out immediately. We waited and we waited..... We told the waiter we were going to leave that it was talking way too long and my husband's food was getting cold, and the waiter said it was coming out now. Finally after about 30 minutes (no joke), my Sea Bass arrives. I started to chuckle as the waiter put the plate in front of me. Not only did i have to wait  30 minutes to get my food, the new Sea Bass he brought me was half the size of the first Sea Bass. I questioned the waiter and he told me they are all the same size as he rolled his eyes. Uh no!! I wish I would of taken a picture of the first piece that came out so then I could of showed the eye rolling waiter that the second piece was literally half the size (same price though). So to sum it up we waited 30 minutes to get a heck of a smaller piece of fish and now my husband's food was cold because he wanted to wait for my food to come out so we could eat together (btw, it was our 20th anniversary). Needless to say we were extremely disappointed and told the waiter we were going to leave and we'll be happy to just pay for our drinks. The waiter came back with the bill and asked us if we wanted to take the food to go (we said no), so he took our plates and walked away. My husband looks at the bill, laughed and said all the food was charged on the bill..... Are you kidding me!!! My husband now upset, flags down the waiter and tells him we are not paying for the food only the drinks that they screwed up and we didn't eat the food. The waiter made it very obvious that he was annoyed as he took the bill and returned shortly with only the drinks on the bill. We paid cash, no tip obviously and we left. Not once during this entire time did a manager ever come to our table and apologize for dropping the ball. This is how my 20th anniversary went at Steak 44, such a disappointment and didn't even get an apology. At least a very nice restaurant in Scottsdale squeezed us in and when we got to that other restaurant and when they sat us down we noticed scrolled at the top of their menu it said \"Happy 20th Anniversary!\" That made my night, very classy(especially after having to squeeze us in at the very last minute). Sorry Steak 44 you lost 2 customers who have been going to your establishment for years, but that obviously didn't matter.",

My fiance and I ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer, NY strips with asparagus and the wild mushroom sides, and the vanilla cake. You are given garlic bread for free along with mini chocolate chip cookies towards the end of your dining. Every dish we ordered was delicious! Sides are definitely good to share. 1 side can be shared between 3-4 hungry people. The crispy shrimp had the right amount of kick and touch of garlic. The bread was soft, served fresh. Service was phenomenal and  fast! Zero complaints! This restaurant is dim with candle lighting therefore very romantic! Great place to go for fine dining!",

    "text": "This is one of the best steak places in the area, everything in the menu is 5 star quality food. The prices are fitting for a formal or business casual affair. Our table split the \"Wagyu\" tomahawk and it was very good for what it was, definitely good for our party of 5 and the most interesting part of the experience was the 500 degree plates that could cook your food more if you wanted. Service is very good and knowledgeable of their menu, a good wine selection and very good at displaying our options. My only reason for taking a star off is that advertising Wagyu the way they do is deceitful in my opinion. The waiter told us their Wagyu is bread in Omaha or something and that just immediately did not make sense to me as soon as he said it. I immediately knew it was just a ploy to get less informed customers to get their most expensive meat. Nevertheless, this pseudo-wagyu was still a very well marbled and flavourful steak and I would come back for special occasions for sure.",

They welcomed my input and apologized for Our experience and admitted that there can always be a blip or two in what is normally in outstanding experience for their customers. I accept that explanation and I I was impressed by their concern and reassurance that they would look into all involved during our dining experience and make sure that everyone was on the same page as to the level and quality of food they serve to their guests.  The general manager personally called me And invited us back to give them another chance with a generous gift card. Thank you steak 44 for trying to make a disappointing experience into the wall and it should've been. We look forward to coming back and dining with you soon. I also have been told by my friend that they have an amazing happy hour so please go check it out!",

    "text": "Bad experience here last evening.  Food was good, ambiance same.  However, this was a work dinner and I am in the medical sales industry.  Our guidelines are clear in that we can only spend $xxx per FDA regulations and compliance standards.  I had a table for 5 and asked the waiter (Hector) at the beginning of the evening to make certain the receipt stated that.  When the check came it said guests=4 and that it couldn't be changed.  The way they determine guest # is by entrees ordered, yet one guest ordered an appetizer as their meal. We were not told this would happen.  The math didn't work as the bill exceeded the price allowable for 4 guests.  Again, I was told by the junior manager (no GM on site and seriously this kid looked like he was 19 or 20).  He said that the system closes the check and nothing could be done.  I asked him to write a quick note on steak 44 letterhead stating the mistake.  Instead, he disappeared (for over 20 minutes - no apologies, no comp drink or dessert while we wait or coffee,  or even a refill on our water) - and when he returned there was no letter.  Instead he \"doctored\" the receipt by photocopying it then changing the 4 to a 5 BY HAND!  Then copied it again and gave it to me, while the original itemized receipt still said 4.  Thanks kid, that certainly won't get my fired.  Are you kidding me, Steak 44?  What kind of shady operation are you running here?  There are a lot of people in my industry in the Phoenix metro and I assure you they will ALL know this story.  Looks like steak 44 and all of its sister restaurants are forever crossed off the list.",

    "text": "Alright, where do I start....  So I called a few weeks prior to the date I wanted to make a reservation for my girlfriend and I. The woman on the phone, I believe her name was Margarita (beautiful name) asked where I would like to be seated and I asked for a booth (I have bad anxiety, booths are a plus) and she gave me more options for booths, dining room, a more private section from the restaurant or a booth next to the kitchen which she described as \"a more romantic setting\" and I'm like oh hell yea! I think she recommended that one cuz I said it was a res for two, very thoughtful.   The day of the res, they gave me a call about 5 hours prior to make sure that we were still coming in, which I thought was very awesome.   Upon arriving, the table we wanted was still occupied so they offered a different seating option, but my girlfriend and I didn't mind waiting plus I really wanted to see this special seating. It was about a 30 minute wait, but the staff were so helpful and friendly about it, keeping us updated on when it would be ready for us, which made it more bearable to wait.    When we were finally seated, the buss boy (who I assume was the buss boy, nicely dressed wearing a chefs jacket) gave us the option of a darker linen which when I asked the waitress why they offer that, it is because the white linen could leave white lint on my black pants. Bougie. Back to the buss boy, he was so funny and friendly and was right there when we needed him, when we needed water (which he offered different types to us, holy crap OPTIONS FOR WATER ARE YIU SERIOUS?!?) and when we would finish our appetizer he came and cleaned our table, I mean used a special tool to get the little pieces of food we may have dropped on the cloth table, so that was lovely. He was so funny, made us feel like home, we almost wanted him to sit down and hang with us!!! (I believe his name was Josh, but he let us call him Kevin, cuz he liked us, sorry for exposing you Kevin, I can't remember the other name!)   The waitress was soooooooo informative and sooooooo friendly, I feel the worst for not remembering her name. She gave us a run down of the menu, since it was our first time, and because we did look young, I think she made it easier for us to understand. Not condescending, just simple and to the point. Service was very quick and on point, it went by so smoothly.   There was what I believe was a manager that came over to say hello and if we needed anything we could ask, again, very friendly and you can tell that every staff members energy was lively and wonderful, the atmosphere was bouncing around like a positive vibe beach ball at an 80s concert.   The food was amazing and came quickly, we found absolutely nothing wrong with any of it. I am definitely someone who knit picks when I go out to eat, and I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart there was nothing I could find wrong with this place.   From the fresh hot bread that came to us before we ordered, to the oysters we got which were so unbelievably fresh (we got to choose whether they came from the east coast, the west coast), to the avocado king crab stack as an appetizer (I am allergic to avocado if it is too ripe, I will get blisters in my mouth, so these were perfectly ripe and fresh which was relieving) to the lobster tails my girlfriend got, and I got the scallops which my fork just melted through, with the sides to dip them in, to the side of whipped potatoes which were just like my dad used to make, to the creamy Mac and cheese which was also fantastic, and lastly the chocolate cake we got, the food was well worth the wait and the money.   The scenery was beautiful and romantic, the service made me feel like home, the food was out of this world, and to share a special anniversary with my girlfriend, there isn't a place I would have rather gone to. Go here and have a night to remember!!!   Oh also, at the end of the meal our wonderful waitress brought us warm, eucalyptus/lemon scented towels that were rolled up but given to us via special tongs was a refreshing end to the service.   I wish we could have taken that buss boy home with us, he was quite the treat. Incredibly hilarious.   Thank you Steak 44 for an incredibly memorable experience.",

    "text": "Too Many Flaws for the Price  My husband and I decided to go to Steak 44 for the first time to celebrate our 31st anniversary.  Although the steak was amazing and cooked to perfection, the rest of the dinner was mediocre.  Just a few things which will make me reconsider before coming back (mind you, our dinner was over $300 for the two of us) ... so I expected absolute perfection.  It started with when we were trying to decide on our wine.  To have so many wines to choose from (well over $75 each), the servers should have some knowledge of the wine selections or at least a sommelier to assist the guests.  Our server didn't have a clue as to what to suggest and we had to \"gamble\" with our choice.  Fortunately, it turned out to be a good wine.  Then my appetizer, which was a crab claw on ice.  It was cracked so much that I ended up eating small pieces of shell and having to spit some out ... it was a mess and for $20 for this one claw!  I was expecting a perfectly shelled claw ready for dipping into the various sauces that they had.  Lastly, and the most disturbing part of our evening, was when my husband lifted the wine bottle to see how much was left in the bottle.  Our server was at the table next to us and he glared at us as if we did something wrong and even commented about our touching the wine bottle to the table next to us!  Really?  This is OUR wine and if we want to lift it up, we certainly can do so!  Even though we had 2 servers, one was handling our table more than the other.  Unfortunately for us, we ended up with the server who was not as efficient or trained and was just not up to our expectations especially for such a high end restaurant.",

We had a reservation but arrived about 30 minutes early and were seated right away(first brownie point TYSM). We ordered a dozen oysters, half east coast and half west coast, they were delectable and fresh! The presentation was just beautiful.  I preferred the west coast although they are more \"earthy\" than the east coast, just a heads up. We then ordered a bottle of Loveblock Pinot Noir which was decently priced. I was pleasantly surprised the server (Stephanie) was able to explain  the background behind the wine brand, very impressive as the wine list was vast.  For mains, I ordered a bone in filet and it was cooked PERFECTLY and served sizzling. We opted for the seafood mac n cheese and asparagus for sides and those were added to our sizzling plates. The aroma was mouthwatering but not overpowering. Beware of your first bite, it will be scorching. We skipped dessert but I'm sure it's amazing. Everything about this place is phenomenal but the amiable staff is what set this steakhouse above any other in Phoenix. I can't wait to visit Steak 44 again! Well done!",

Drinks, ambience, service, food. Don't expect to pay less than $200 for 2 people. Every-time we've gone the bill has been 100-150 per person and that's 1-2 drinks, steak, one side. Way better ambience than city hall in my opinion",

First let me say it was crazy busy but that made me feel like I made a great choice lol. I DID make a reservation because it was Friday. I tried to call and get in before my 845 reservation lol but they said that was my best bet. It was freaking worth it. they said they were running 10 to 15 behind on seating but we were seated right on time.   Ryan was our fantastic waiter. He was busy and flying back and forth but i never felt like he was too busy for us. I am a full 20% tipper and i did tip over 20 but i feel bad cause i think i should have done more lol. He was friendly and knowledgeable and attractive lol not like that has anything to do with anything. I just wanted to throw that out there. The food runner was great as well; i didnt get his name though. Our glasses were refilled when they hit half way. This is the kind of service I expected and I was not disappointed. When they boxed up all my food i told them to get ALL THE SAUCE lol and they did it.   my NY strip was amazing. The bread they bring is fluffy and great flavor. we got our bread half regular and half garlic herb.... just go full garlic herb! lol its great! on the menue it says \"get these!\" under the Brussel sprouts..... GET THEM! I had the lobster mac and cheese... it was good BUT i will say it is better at Capital Grille. However, S44 was nice a gooey with HUGE pieces of lobster.... they were NOT stingy :) i was pleased.I took everything to go lol. OMG AND if you have never heard about truffle butter spend the 5 bucks and get it lol... but listen to Drakes truffle butter song then go there and eat it and you'll be singing the song the whole time.   The ambiance is great and the decor is wonderful. I got some decorating ideas lol i love the chairs. I'm sad I was too full for dessert... and omg i just realized i didn't finish my wine... how rude. lol i was too focused on getting an Uber.   I'm excited to warm up my food in a few.",

Inside you'll see has low lighting and thoughtful decor. Everything from the light fixtures to the wall paper seemed well designed and put together. We sat in a booth which had a kind of frosted glass on the walls dividing us from the other tables to feel more private. There was fabric on one of the walls, and beautiful wall paper on another.   The service is similar to Mastro's. You have multiple waitstaff assisting and sides are served in a cast iron pan to share family style. Your entrees are sizzling hot when they arrive.   Ordered.....   Appetizers: shrimp (HUGE), oysters (YUM)  Sides: Mushrooms, creamed spinach, lobster mash potatoes. (All fantastic choices)  Main dishes: filet mignon and NY steak.   All of the food and drinks (Pellegrino, Prosecco, Chardonnay) were excellent.  Service....  Everything arrived quickly and as requested. Though the server wasn't sure if he could accommodate our steak request (but he did!). When I asked for more information about the types of oysters he seemed knowledgable.   All in all, the experience was fantastic. The food and atmosphere were amazing.",

Sorry Trina.   Food good. Wine awesome. Four glasses of Meiomi for my and my Fiance.   Funny thing...Daniel (the manager?) came to table to apologize for the subpar service. Said he would adjust the bill for each patron. Then after about 10 minutes came back to the table with clanking glasses and a bottle of Prosecco saying it would be easier to give us some champagne (sorry when did Prosecco become champagne) than making any financial adjustments to our bills.   Laughable. I will not be back. At $100 per person.",

Several different people introduced themselves to us from the moment we sat down. Our water was constantly refilled, the table was cleaned up in between courses & we never felt rushed. Highly suggest the petite filet mignon, sauteed corn, the Heirloom Tomato salad was splendid & the meatballs as an appetizer were unbelievable! When I made the reservation I mentioned it was my husbands birthday. Matt even brought out a complimentary dessert that was perfection! Honestly, we couldn't have chosen a better spot to celebrate my husbands 39th birthday. YELP reviews gives a perfect report on the high class experience this restaurant delivers. Well done!

Now don't get me wrong, my husband and I don't usually patronize such high end establishments, we are middle class, happy with your neighborhood steak houses, but this place is on another playing level. The food is spectacular, the staff is prompt,courteous and don't make you feel like you don't belong there. Very patient and helpful, with suggestions of what drink would compliment the meal. The manager visited our table, and was genuine and made us feel so welcomed and he comped our dessert because it was my birthday. Granted it is a high priced menu, but well worth the splurge (even though our friend picked up the tab). We will definitely tighten our belts to have this experience again. If I could give more stars I would. Kudos Steak 44!",

When we asked about our table, their response was that they only had two cocktail servers for the dining room. Not my fault... I made a reservation so they knew we were coming... They put us against a wall next to a party of 8 which was not a pleasant experience.  We ordered the seabass, pan-seared crispy on the outside and medium on the inside. It came medium rare and soft on the outside which was obviously sent back. The manager came by and the fix was made. It came out and was an amazing piece of fish. They remade our sides which was great as well. Definitely a service recovery. In the end, they brought us a complimentary dessert and took care of the seabass and our side from our bill. The end of the meal was a success and a complete 360 from the start. Great food and drinks.  My only feedback to the management when he stopped by the table is to not touch the guests. The gentleman grabbed my shoulder before I even saw him and it was not pleasant. He kept his hand there the entire time he was at our table... Twice he did this and it was uncomfortable. Just feedback for the future.",

    "text": "Seriously, Steak 44 has some of the best beef I've had in a long time. Add the swanky atmosphere, superb service and delicious sides and desserts to that and you have a fun and mouthwatering night!  After poring through each delicious item on the menu (I seriously wanted one of each, can I just order a whole cow and work my way through?) I was intrigued by the steak farina. I like steak, I like eggs, so I should like steak with egg on top, especially if it's a 28 day aged bone in filet mignon! I also got the corn creme brulee as a side to complete my meal. As for appetizers, we shared the crispy shrimp.  The complimentary bread we had was delicious. It had a savory buttery top with very soft dough. The shrimp came next and were fried perfectly, with a light crunchy batter and just the right amount of sauce, with a little bit of heat from the chiles.   I absolutely loved the steak farina. The filet was a sight to behold, a perfectly cooked medium-rare, gustatory delight. It was very tender and well seasoned. The actual meat had so much flavor which is impressive since I've oftentimes found filet mignon to be very tender but not taste as good as ribeye. It makes me wonder how much more flavor their ribeye has if the filet is that good! The egg on top was a perfect sunny side up, and provided some creaminess to the earthy, primal taste of the beef. Forget ordering food a la mode, I want all my meals to be a l'oeuf now!  The creme brulee corn was not bruleed that much but it was sweet, creamy, rich and indulgent, a perfect side to go with the beef and egg.  Service was impeccable and everyone was working together to make our dining experience enjoyable. A manager even came over to make sure we were happy with our meal.   Since we were celebrating a birthday they brought out a special warm vanilla cake with gelato and sliced pecans on top. Oh so good. We were so stuffed by the time we were finished here!  Even the bathrooms are super swanky and posh. This is the first bathroom I've seen that has its own dedicated hat rack.   So for some of the best steak and service around, Steak 44 is a 100 in my book!",

    "text": "Went there last night with a friend for happy hour.   I had the double \"maker's mark\" manhattan, and she had a vodka martini (not on the HH menu.)   I had the steak & fries and she had the  jumbo shrimp cocktail.  Yummmm!!   The steak medallions were oh, sooo good.   Seasoned, fried, and cooked to perfect.   Her shrimps were huge!   She had it prior and loved it.   Since that appeared to be her dinner and there were only two, I didn't try it.  The manhattan was perfect as well.  A customer, who says he goes there EVERY Friday sat next to me.   We started a conversation.   He ordered a bottle of Belle Glos Pinot Noir.   He was nice enough to share it with us.   My friend had it prior and was familiar with the wine.   He said he has a private reserve at the restaurant but didn't order one of those.     He ordered the bone-in ribeye and baked potato.   The ribeye was mainly for his dog, but he and I ate a few bites.   YUMMMM!   Actually, it tasted like my steak.   Seasoned to perfection and tender.  The service was great.  The bartenders and bar backs are very attentive, friendly, and professional.   The general manager gave me his card for those times myself and other friends decide to check it out.  Sorry I don't have a photo of what I had.   I started eating it before I remembered to snap a shot of it.   Oh, well.   Next time cause I will definitely be back.",

I love to treat my girlfriend for her birthday, Valentine's Day, anniversaries, etc.   I get the bone-in ribeye - the best I've ever had - and a side of their au gratin potatoes (I believe they have changed the name to the Chef's Potatoes.) My girlfriend always gets the filet mignon - it seriously melts in your mouth.  Each steak is cooked to perfection and served on a a boiling hot plate. The meat is literally sizzling when it's placed in front of you. The aromas are fabulous and the food is unbeatable.  Even better than the food - the service. The staff does everything they can to make sure your experience is nothing short of perfect. On one trip, we had our leftovers packed up to go, but when we returned home we realized they had mixed up our order with someone else! When they called me the next day to ask how my dinner was, I mentioned the mix-up and was pleasantly surprised when they sent us a gift card to make up for it!  Try out this beautiful Arcadia restaurant. You won't be disappointed!",

Brian was our server and he did an amazing job taking care of us and providing the right information.  Started off with the King Crab & Avocado Stack, and it was just the right size appetizer for two.  Personally would go no red onions next time, but was full of flavor.  I ordered the 12 oz filet, medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.  The steak was pure in flavor and so tender.  For sides we ordered lobster mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, creme brulee corn and mushrooms (no mushrooms for me).  The corn and potatoes were so good, corn almost like a dessert but not to sweet to have as a side.  To end it we had red velvet bread pudding and the warm vanilla caramel cake and these desserts were unreal.  The sweetness of the caramel sauce and the moist red velvet bread pudding were the perfect ending.  Service and attention to detail here were second to none.  If you can request Brian to take care of you, he gets it.",

The steak is always cooked perfectly, I recommend you add truffle butter.  The beignets are an amazing end to a great meal.  The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is due to their drinks.  I despise the fact the soft drinks (including ice teas) are per bottle, which quickly adds to an already pricey tab.  I really wish they'd offer fountain soda with free refills, like every other restaurant!  Same goes for the ice tea, a nice steakhouse should have something brewed fresh with free refills.",

They absolutely are!   Every time we have come it's been a great experience with amazing service. They are extremely accommodating for special occasions or if you are just stopping in for a nice dinner. I highly recommend making reservations at least a week early because they book up quick. We still always end up waiting when we arrive but no longer than 5-10 minutes.    The food is amazing. The steaks are cooked perfectly every time and the sides are also very well prepared. I highly recommend the crispy shrimp appetizer. The flavor is unique and has a bit of a kick to it and then breading is amazingly crispy.",

Be careful when ordering steak here. They serve the steak so hot that oil spatters from it. No one mentions this at the restaurant so please be ready for the incoming hot oil. I wish I would have read the negative reviews online as I found out others have mentioned this. Customers should really be warned of this when plates are served.  When they placed my steak in front of me the oil spattered everywhere getting my arms and chest. I raised my napkin to protect my face, lowered the napkin a bit and right below my eye it went, I am so glad it did not go into my eye.   The servers here are really nice and tried to help but I was so taken a back by this, I was hungry, and I was tipsy from a martini. All I wanted to do was eat with one hand and rub ice on my eye with the other, which I ultimately did.  Aside from this, ambience is loud, crowded, and hectic. Food was just alright, not worth the $264 bill. Ordered a \"Domestic Wagyu\" steak that resembled a filet mignon. It was very lean.",

Duly noted that things were handled wrong and he was willing to make things right and he was gonna make adjustments to those people to do a better performance. The food was amazing.

    "text": "Ok so my first experience I wasn't pleased due to a few things so the GM contacted me and gave me a $300 gift card to come back in because the restaurant didn't exceed my expectations.  (3 total in the party) The restaurant has different sections due to desired noise and energy level which I wasn't aware of the first time attending the establishment.  We sat by the kitchen this time instead of the bar area. Our waiter was knowledgeable in all the dishes and attended us with professionalism and humor, he was great originally from Chicago. The food was great the first time as well, no complaints there. Also a thanks to the manager Seth for sending out a plate of yummy potatoes for us to sample. I heard about this place for two years and now see why people are always talking highly of it!  Enjoy guys!",

The meatball appetizer was great, the beet salad was fresh and flavorful, the beef filets were incredibly tender, the creamed spinach was wonderful and the caramel cake desert was over the top. Not cheap but we'll worth the money. The only negative was the location of our table close to the bar area. Quite noisy. We will be back",

This one, much like the original Mastro's steakhouse up in North Scottsdale tops my list.  Yes, the steaks are outstanding, that goes w/o saying.  The quality of their seafood and selection is really what puts this \"steakhouse\" over the top.  Fresh Dungeness crab, raw oysters, fresh fish, you name it.  Also deep wine list and many selections are not overpriced like some of the other higher end restaurants here in town.  Last time I was there I had a bottle of Belle Glos \"Las Alturas\" (single vineyard) that was very reasonably priced.  Always had very good service, as they have always made every accommodation for me and the people in my groups.  Never had a bad experience or left feeling like I didn't truly enjoy myself.  I'd like to see them offer \"dry scallops\" and \"dry-aged beef\", but other than that, this place is amazing.  Nice to spend time in an establishment where the word \"mediocre\" is never acceptable by the owners and staff alike.",

No card and the server didn't even know we were celebrating a birthday. After we were finally seated and able to order food by 8pm, everything was absolutely amazing and our server Melanie exceeded expectations. She was very attentive and friendly. Melanie went above and beyond to make our first experience here as great as it could be. Will most definitely be back, just hope next time management has a better hold on things and doesn't keep us for waiting 30 minutes past out reservation time then insist he can't just \"kick people out.\"",

We were greeted by our waiter shortly after we sat down. I was very surprised at the way the waiter introduced us to the menu and we were well educated on the best options to choose from. He even explained to us about all the wines in terms of what suites our likings best. We ordered the meatballs and the crispy shrimp for appetizers and they came to the table within minutes. The shrimp was spicy yet delicious and the meatballs were great with the marinara sauce accompanying them. For the entree we ordered the ribeye, the petite filet, and the ahi filet all of which were delicious. The sides to go with the meals work differently than most restaurants in a way that you order any given number of sides and they are distributed to everyone's plates. The sides we ordered were the corn creme brulee, dominick's potatoes, and the asparagus fries. Super yummy! Lastly for dessert we had the strawberry gelato and the red velvet bread pudding that came with a vanilla gelato. Those were to die for!! When we finished eating and the table was cleared of our plates, warm, wet hand towels were brought to us along with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Overall the food was excellent and the dining experience was amazing. Would definitely want to come back!!",

    "text": "So, it was my Mom's 91st B-day last nite. We, as EXTREMELY longtime Arcadia residents, 4 generations worth, finally decided to try Steak 44, expecting Mastro-like quality and service. I asked for a quiet table in the back given the large span of ages, 5 - 91, so of course they placed us right off the bar, in the ridiculously fly-ridden nwc table. Still hoping for the best we started celebrating. Our family includes a number of serious foodies including 3 chefs, one of Manhattan ilk. All at the table are well versed in fine dining. However, I actually felt dispised by our server. He succeeded in offending every single adult at the table save my elderly parents who couldn't hear him and were completely ignored throughout. Although it was my dear ol' Dad that forked over the $650 at the end without a word after our server totally ruined his wife of 57 year's birthday. We got 6 filets of various sizes/bone inclusion and one rib-eye. Everyone was disappointed in the filets. Good quality meet prepared with no flavor. The sides were insanely small. Not only that, the server felt running around giving us each a teaspoon of potatoes and one asparagus spear was better than simply addressing the mistake honestly and bringing out more (or advising us properly ahead of time). He said sides typically serve 1 - 4. Really? How's that work? He literally even fought me on the complexities of bringing me a fresh glass of ice water!  Drinks were pouring at the other end of the table but he became indignant when he realized one of our guests knew more about wine than he and began arguing vs. simply going and finding out the answer requested. Strawberry cake was overcooked and too sweet. After ordering I asked him how long until the first course arrived to ensure we had enough time for my Mom to quickly open her gifts, take pics. He assured me we had 10 minutes to do so and then dropped the salads within 5, no comment, ruining the event. Got the best bone-in filet of my life at Mastro's north. Why not here? Maybe the manager carelessly barging in and out of our meal, while clearly not reading the situation right at all, coupled with the bowl of dilapidated Jolly Rancher candies proffered up on the way out (purchased from the local dollar store) kinda re-cap the overall mind-set here. They called me today to ask how our experience was. When I shared same including the fact none of us ever plan on returning she thanked me and did nothing to give me any feeling at all they valued our business.",

Not as juicy and tender as you can get from Fleming's for the same price.  The lobster mac & cheese was not very cheesy and lacked flavor.  The Brussels sprouts were good.  The creamed spinach tasted like frozen spinach.  The rolls served before the meal were amazing though! The waitress was really over-bearing and pushy.  She kept trying to sell things to us and wouldn't take no for an answer.  Her and every other waiter that passed by wanted to \"serve us our sides.\"  I don't understand why it is necessary to have them scoop our food onto our plate for us, and when we say no, they look at us as if we are weird.  I don't want people touching my food and spoon feeding me as if I'm a child.  On top of all of this, there was only one other table in the restaurant, and that table was so loud and drunk, we couldn't even talk at our table.  It was absolutely a terrible experience!  I feel like this restaurant is supposed to be a romantic restaurant with the dim lighting, white tablecloths, and upscale decor, but it was more like a bar with the loud clientele and music.  For the price, I'd much rather eat somewhere else.",

It was quite simply the best meal we've ever had! We started off with the fried deviled eggs- amazing- then we had the calamari & shrimp- delicately battered , fried and delicious. We both had the Delmonico ribeyes. Mine was with the Oscar style- my husband had his prepared in the classic way.  They arrived sizzling and juicy- perfect! We also enjoyed the Vidalia onion rings and the cream corn brulee- yummy!!Then we also got spoiled with the treat of the strawberry shortcake- which was simply sublime!  We can't wait to go back; the service, atmosphere, fabulous food and value make Steak 44 a keeper and a classic in the world of Five Star fine dining restaurants.",

    "text": "We've known about Steak 44 since they opened in April, however, had never been there.  We've sort of written off expensive steak houses in the Valley because we make better meats and fish on our infra-red grill at home than can be found at most steak houses.  The last time we ate at one of such referenced places (I will keep the name nameless) I sent my $50 salmon back two or three times (I RARELY send food back to the kitchen, but at $50 it was going to be edible) and ended up not eating that night, as by the time all was said and done our entire group had already finished their meals.  Because it was my husband's birthday, and the menu looked good and reasonably priced, we decided to break our grudge towards over-priced steak houses and give Steak 44 a try.  Wow!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  The menu had so much to pick from, it was hard to decide what to order.  The food was outstanding (wait till you try their bread!), as was the ambiance and the entire staff.  Our server was a lovely young woman named Ibki (I apologize if I have the name misspelled) who was not only professional, attentive, genuinely friendly, but was also extremely knowledgable about the entire menu and wine list-- she hit it out of the ballpark with her red wine suggestion!  We will definitely return to Steak 44, though our lack of desire to go back to other upscale steak houses remains.  Treat yourself and give Steak 44 a try, you'll be hooked.  BTW... they also offer a tremendous Happy Hour in a beautiful surrounding.",

They serve these buttered and seasoned rolls while you're waiting for your food... They are \"to die for\"!! I had the filet mignon and it was prepared to perfection!! I also had the brussel sprouts and the loaded baked potato. The food is served \"family style\" as opposed to being served on your plate. For example, my plate had the filet only. The sides were in small dishes, to be shared with others at the table... You simply scoop out the amount you wish to eat. Very interesting...  it is pricy though! Two filets, and two sides, two bottles waters and two cocktails were $162.",

    "text": "I had planned to dine at Prime Steak House, at the Bellagio in Vegas, but my trip fell through because of a problem with my dog, Gracie. So to cheer me up, my consort invited me to join him at Steak 44, the newest Maestro upscale eatery, located in Arcadia at the site of the old Cork 'N Cleaver.  Steak 44, seemed more causal and less expensive than Dominick's at the Quarters, which cost a whopping $6 million to build. You won't see palatial chandeliers or a retractable roof, but instead you'll cast your eyes on the horse-shoe lined bar with overhead sexy lighting, tables with crisp, white linen cloths, polished rich wood everywhere, and a stunning collection of flasks and shakers which get lost in the soft lighting. What a coincidence because my consort has the world's largest collection of cocktail shakers from the turn of the nineteenth century to the present. I know because they take up a great deal of space in my foyer.  Dinner began with two stiff Negroni's and a choice of fresh baked garlic or sea salt rolls smothered in butter and served in cast iron skillets still steaming from the oven. After tasting the overly salted and garlicky bread, I opted for plain rolls with a side of butter. I took a few bites and began modeling the pretzel-like dough, like Play Doh, forming a smiley face. I would have preferred a crusty, rustic French or Italian loaf to the Pillsbury doughboy.  The appetizer selection took a while because of my aversion to fried foods. I choose the beet salad, small chunks of ruby and golden beets sprinkled with goat cheese peppered with pistachios. Within five minutes, my plate was empty. My consort ordered panko-breaded fried deviled eggs with a sriracha aioli. The crispy outer layer functioned as a fancy gift wrapping for a perfectly cooked farm fresh egg and the aioli served as the ribbons. My usual dislike for fried foods didn't apply to this dish. In fact, when the waiter tried to clear the remains of the aioli we gave him a verbal hand-slap.  We split the main course, steak farina, the bone-in filet mignon, topped with a fried egg. It's a steak house, so we anticipated a good piece of meat, but the main course surpassed our expectations. The menu includes options like Petite Filet, Delmonico, NY Strip, or Bone-in NY Strip. The kitchen controls the quality of the beef by cutting their own to fit their needs, including the unique bone-in filet. The chef, Geoff Baumberger, uses a spice rub for his steaks, cooks them at 1500 degrees, and serves the ordered cuts on a 500 degree platter. Our steak was cooked to perfection, medium as requested, with only one flaw--a little too much salt in the rub. This gorgeous butter-tender steak was accompanied by a pair of pathetic slices of grilled greasy toast.  Most steak houses offer a few a la carte sides, but at Steak 44, you have 18 to choose from. We selected the sauteed steamed spinach laden with garlic and Dominick's potatoes, an au gratin with caramelized onion, Gouda, and mozzarella. The spinach bombed, but the potatoes were a smash and the leftovers even better the next night as a side dish with dinner.  We ordered an Oregon Pinot Noir to accompany the dinner which didn't arrive until after our plates were cleared. Red faced and apologetic, the waiter comped us the vino. We studied the desert delights, but satisfied and full from our meal, we decided to pass. If you like sweets, white chocolate, s'mores, or chocolate peanut butter, you'll enjoy the selections with your favorite, but pricey desert wines.  If you're a health nut, you won't be dining here more than once. If you like your meals rich and well-seasoned, then this might become your next go- to hangout.  I am the DinnerSlut.",

Mouth watering bread.  So warm, soft and seasoned perfectly.  Second, we always have the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp are the size of a small lobster.  They are huge and delicious.  My hubby always get the 12oz filet which is tender and juicy.  Since it was my baday, this time, I got the lobster and 8oz bone in filet.  The bone in filet is a little more tender but def a little more work to get the meat off the bone.  Both are excellent.  All the sides are good too.  We love the lobster mac and cheese.  The corn creme brulee is good too.  I love the sweet potato with marshmallow cream, my hubby hates sweet potato and thought it was pretty good.  As for the dessert, my favorite is the brown butter cake and my hubby like the cookies and cream sundae.  I've tried the red velvet bread pudding, it was good but got a little too sweet after several bites (good thing to share for 2 or more people).",

We noticed it was kind of loud when we were sat, but no biggie - I only turned 34, don't mind the noise.  But as our meal progressed, the table next to us - but technically in the bar - became louder and louder, screaming profanities and quite disgusting stories of their supposed sexual escapades.  My husband and I could not hear each other talk.  At one point I yelled just to see if anyone would even look, I was drowned out by the unfortunate crowd next to us and not a single person so much as even turned their head.    I went to use the ladies room and when one opened, another intoxicated man stumbled out.  He had relieved himself all over the seat, floor, etc.  I felt like I was in some college dive bar, not out for a special, $100 per person dinner.  I realize that some of this could not be prevented by the restaurant.  But I do think at some point the manager, or anyone really, should have approached the group of guys and just asked them to tone it down.  They were obviously bothering the patrons around us.  For the good - the food was delicious.  We both ordered the rib-eye and it was amazing.  The corn creme brule and dominic's potatoes were both quite good.  I was not impressed with the crispy asparagus.  It was blanched asparagus with a tempura batter.  Not crispy and not flavorful.  But really, I loved everything else and would return in a heartbeat had it not been for the ridiculously loud, frat party atmosphere.  Because of that I will not return.",

Steak 44 is fun, vibrant and lighted! Lol.  My favorite is the Wagyu NY, I've also gotten the Kansas City and the Tomahawk. Their sides are insane, I recommend them all. The appetizers are also absolutely nuts too!  One thing you have to get is the beignet tree. These beignets may be the best beignets you can get outside of New Orleans.

We ordered the avocado stack appetizer(awesome appetizer!), two steaks one with foie gras and the other with the lobster tail, the crab mac n cheese, and finally some gelato and caramel cake. The steaks have ruined me, as they were some of the best-prepared steaks I've had the pleasure of dining on. The side dishes are large, so order cautiously. The desserts were very refreshing after such a large meal, and their wine selection is stupendous! Once again, I cannot thank Jessica and Tumas enough for how well they treated us, and Ray seems like a genuinely good guy when he drove us home.",

    "text": "This was by far the best meal experience l've ever had in our valley.  Our maitre D described the menu from the appetizers to the dessert options. All sounded so incredible that we ordered a dozen plates! It was a True epicurean experience that led us to travel various parts of the world with our palates. We commenced our communial feast with iced king crab legs, a Hawaiaan Poke and blue point oysters.  Each plate is presented in a very sober way, no frill.... It's all about the food. So why add foufou decorations? A waste of space and truly an unnecessary distraction.  I really appreciated this very pure form of honoring a delectable dish.  King crab and Ahi poke were like tasting the True essence of the ocean: pure, clean, perfect. There was no need to add lemon juice.   The poke was marinated in cucumber, thai chili and togarashi sauce (sublime). I then had the Chilean sea bass. Again very simple to the point: a dash of chardonnay, sea salt and cracked pepper. It was perfectly flaky, it almost has the multiple layers of a puff pastry. I picked the corn creme brulee, a sweet corn with cream and turbinado sugar.  I wanted more of it, it was incredibly good.  We share a superfood salad, very hearty and a steak knife BLT bacon and blue cheese. I will be sure to have it again at my next visit! At our table we also had the Shetland island salmon spiedini (delish), whipped potato, a Yukon gold with cream butter, nice.  The boys had a lobster tail, a prime rib steak, filet mignon. Meat plates came to our table at 500 degree heat! It allows the heat to continue cooking to the desired color. Wow! Finally we has dessert, a raspberry sorbet and a vanilla ice cream with some kind of cake layer under (can't remember the name). Desserts were nice without jumping on the table.  We had a simple Slingshot Cabernet to accompany our culinary journey, it was PARFAIT!",

    "text": "I love Steak44, we all usually come mid-week to avoid the weekend nonsense. We got an amazing table in a semi glass enclosure looking into the kitchen (the kitchen is clean and flawless btw) Our server was friendly and attentive HOWEVER while I understand up selling is part of their job this visit took it to another level \"would anyone care for wine?\" Pretty standard question no biggie, after ordering a ton of appetizers, \"can I get anyone a salad?\" Ordering my steak \"can I interest you in the Wagyu cut?\" I love ordering a $60 dollar steak and being shamed for not opting for a $120 dollar Wagyu \"would you like to make your steak crab cake Oscar style?\" Thank you no I already added truffle butter. I frankly got so sick of saying no, I should be used to it but this visit just seemed a little extreme. APPETIZERS, tuna was fresh and amazing, meatballs were succulent and filling, three words FRIED DEVILED EGGS! This isn't Easter Sunday at Grandma's house where I turn my nose up at deviled eggs, these are AMAZING! Ribeye with truffle butter was very good, I know that your steak is only as good as the cut, this cut wasn't as good as some that I have had lately a little more fat on it. Sugar peas and sauteed sweet corn was very good, hasselback potatoes were fantastic crispy and with even more truffle butter. Too many other sides to mention haha. During our meal a maitre d sat down at a table across from us then evidently a manager of some capacity came to check on us (I always appreciate that) then he sat down with the maitre d across from us and had a meal, never had that happen before but okay. Steak44 is always consistent though a little disappointed in my steak and I've never had to say \"no\" so many times since buying my last car.",

My favorite dish here is torn between the bone in filet, and the crusted Sea Bass.  Holy Sh** it is flavorful buttery heaven.  It's so soft it's almost like eating a cloud, but the crust gives it the perfect crunch and texture.  I ALWAYS recommend dish to newcomers, and they are always blown away.  I absolutely love the semi-private dining, and it's cool how each room has a bit of a different feel.  Took a long time to post a review... I guess even when you go somewhere regularly, you can forget to review.  Sorry guys!!!  Sure Steak 44 is a chain (been to their places in Boston, Dallas, Phoenix, and Scottsdale)... sometimes the chain aspect ruins things.  Not here.  This place is perfection.",

It took awhile for the tall, skinny bartender to acknowledge us even after we were seated! He helped everyone at the bar before he got to us, and I was a bit peeved but didn't want to make a big deal about it, hence my 3 star rating.   After happy hour, we were taken to our table for dinner, where the service was much better and our awesome server made sure we were well taken care of. The steak was absolutely delicious. Their wine selection is insanely good. I will definitely be back and hopefully have a more pleasant experience at the bar.",

We are from San Diego that has some good seafood and steak restaurants but this place near both mine and my boyfriends favorite steak place (and he's a picky meat eater). Once you walk in you can smell the delicious fresh caught seafood. They also have the kitchen surrounded by glass walls so you can see the food being prepared. Their portions are perfect for sharing, we didn't even finish our apps and sides. The service was also amazing the waitress (blonde female) and bus boy (tan with long hair) were super friendly and gave great recommendations, they made us feel at home. The management even had us sit in a nice big secluded booth and gave him a birthday card and a free dessert. Their signature dessert (a white cake with roasted nuts) was literally orgasmic I was full but I was able to eat that, they also give you little cookies with the bill which were yummy. I'm no big baller but this price is definitely worth what you are paying for. Also free valet when you dine here. If we come back for spring training we will eat here perfect for special events!",

We were greeted by the hostesses and asked if they would be able to squeeze us in and they were able to! I was so happy as we were celebrating.  We went to the bar for cocktails and appetizers. We ordered the house bread which comes out piping hot and so soft, braised pork belly and shrimp cocktail. Although, the shrimp are sold $8 each, be prepared, they are huge. 2 was enough for us.   When our table was ready we were greeted by our waiter who gave us plenty of food and drink suggestions. He even assured me that any dietary restrictions would be accommodated. I ordered a NY strip well done (I'm currently expecting) and my hubby ordered the Bone in rib eye. They were cooked to perfection. We paired it with the Au Gratin potatoes that are served family style. The service was great as well as the atmosphere. We had a wonderful dinner here.",

We had a bunch of apps, I had the filet, my wife had the sea bass.  Everything was good (as expected given the price tag).  The temperature on the steak was off so they took it back and fixed it right away and comped the desert.  Would probably not be back, overall Domenic is a better ambiance and experience and it's the same menu and price.

The only complaint was they pack too many tables in the dinning area, to the point of being ridiculous.  You cannot move a chair without hitting someone else, a real challenge getting to the bathroom.  If they simply removed a 4 top and a 2 top it would make a huge difference.

We shared the lobster/crab mash potatoes as the side and it was delicious.     I would describe the atmosphere as old school trendy. I feel like all the hip extras in the 1980s show Miami Vice retired, move to Scottsdale and this is their primary hangout spot. If your looking for a Suga Daddy this is the place, but you will need to get there early because there's some competition at the bar.",

Thank you, thank you, to this awesome restaurant for helping me celebrate my 21st bday with my family! Food was perfect as usual, drinks were on point (woo hoo!), and we all loved our waitress.   The ONLY downfall of the night was the squishy table we were put at. Seemed really difficult for the wait staff to get in between our table and the one next to us - and I felt really bad that my father had constant traffic behind his chair. We will have to reserve further in advanced next time! I also do have to say, after sitting back and watching, props to them for making the best out of the situation. Their staff works so incredibly hard and does it with a smile on their faces! I truly believe this is a big part about why an evening spent there is so fun and enjoyable!",

It's totally worth it but just know it's UBER expensive. The crispy shrimp appetizer is TO DIE FOR. Thankfully there's a small portion, which I got since I was dining alone and wanted to try so many things. I got the petit filet, Oscar style (with crab and bearnaise). Omfg was it delicious. My favorite side was the  double baked truffle potato. Creamed spinach was yummy, though heavy. The corn creme brulee is a must try. Will go back as soon as I can afford it!!",

When I did a little researching (thanks Yelp), I found out about Steak 44 and jumped into my Uber.    From start to finish, this was one of the best meals I have ever had.  Service was top notch.  The entree (bone in filet) was out of control good.  Perfectly seasoned.  The sides that I shared with a co-worker (creamed spinach, baked potato, mac n cheese) were all pretty amazing.  The potato was the size of an NFL football, the creamed spinach was steaming hot, and the mac n cheese had a nice crumble on top and lots of flavors.  We were so full that we skipped dessert, but the passing plates almost made us regret not busting our seams that night.    I can not recommend Steak 44 enough.  Whether you are passing through Phoenix like I was or live down the street, do yourself a favor and sit down for a meal here.",

    "text": "My wife loves Steak 44 so it's been her selection for her birthday dinner two years running. The steaks are delicious and expertly cooked, the drinks creative, and most of the sides tasty (didn't care for Hasselback potato, it was dry - maybe overcooked?).  To be honest, after our first visit I was ready to give it a 3 or 4 star review, because we had really sub-par service. I looked longingly at the other table with the animated and engaged server, but we did enjoy the drinks and food.  This time though was amazing. I don't know if it's because I told them ahead of time it was my wife's birthday, or we just had gotten unlucky the first time, but from start to finish we thoroughly enjoyed our time. On arrival, there was a handwritten card from the manager thanking us for choosing Steak 44 for her birthday celebration. The steaks were as fantastic as the first time, the drinks still expertly mixed, but this time the service was up to snuff. To top it all off, they gave my wife a free dessert, and then someone from Steak 44 called me the Monday after to make sure everything was acceptable. I wish they had called the first time so I could have given more timely constructive criticism. But this time it is praise all around.   Looking forward to next July! :)",

The Rib -Eye Steak is cooked to perfection. My absolute favorites are the Maryland Style Lump Crab Cakes, Roasted Brussel  Sprouts and the Alaskan King Crab/ Rock Shrimp Macoroni Cheese.   I have to mention the excellent customer service. Scott our host was very patient  and  accommodating. It was a large group of 15, all of the food arrived to the table on time, orders correct  and cooked to perfection.   . Oh by the way, we were celebrating our friend's birthdays and at the end of dinner, the two birthday guest received complimentary Birthday Desserts,  which were also delish.

    "text": "First tip, this is not a cheap restaurant. But, well worth the cost.   My husband and I decided dinner here on Jan 1st sounded like an amazing way to bring in 2018. We weren't disappointed.   They have complimentary valet parking, which was nice being as I was in heels.   The ambiance of the restaurant is dark, and romantic. There is a fireplace in the back that gives off a nice light. The Well located speakers everywhere make the music available through out the decently sized restaurant. Def an upscale place. No flip flops or tank tops! This place deserves your best.     First, we were seated near a television playing the Alabama vs Crimson game (by happens chance and desire) but, it didn't feel like a sports bar. Which, I liked quite a bit.   Our waitress was amazingly sweet and she kept up with us all night. I will say the tables are a little congested, so you will hear many conversations simply because of how close you are. Privacy, on a busy night, probably isn't happening.   For drinks we ordered (me) a ginger peach (strong bourbon taste, not too sweet) and (him) Blood Orange (sweet, cosmo type drink). We enjoyed them all dinner as they were quite large. We ordered the seafood bar (king crab legs, Giant shrimp, and oysters) which was fairly filling and the seafood tasted super fresh. 5 different dipping sauces was awesome as well. We then shared a KC prime and the Hassleback potato. Forewarning, the steak plates are VERY VERY hot. Don't touch them! The steak was cooked to our desire (medium rare) and was amazingly juicy. The potato's were to die for. Even full, we wanted more. We then ordered the begneit tree for dessert. Came with 2 dipping sauces and was the perfect ending to an incredible meal. Sharing was the best option for us, and it filled both of us up!   One complaint I have is half the menu has MP in place of a price because the price must change frequently. However, we were told the wrong price for something, then charged more. They rectified the issue, but it's an inconvenience that could be avoided.  The second complaint I have is the small bar top table chairs (tall, white, fake leather) are deteriorating. They were quite ripped and flaking and shredded. For the cost of OUR dinner, I'd be able to replace 2 of them at the minimum.   Overall, I loved our experience. It was expensive. But we knew it would be. If you're looking for a date night place to impress, you can't go wrong.",

Our party was seated promptly at our reservation time. Our table overlooked the tasteful decor near the bar area. The waiter recommended the special steak called the Tomahawk and all his promises were realized after the first bite. From appetizers to desserts we enjoyed a wonderful meal. The professional wait staff only added to my impression of this terrific restaurant. You won't regret making Steak44 your choice for a great night out in Phoenix.",

The sides were delicious, although small. We had the mac and cheese, au gratin potatoes, fries, snap peas, brussell sprouts, corn brulee. Dessert was one of the best I ever had. It was a sundae with popcorn in it and home made fudge sauce. My husband had the chocolate cake which he said was very sweet, yet delicious. He could not eat much of it because it was so rich. My daughter had the smores in a jar and my son had the peanut butter milkshake. They give you rolls with a delicious seasoning in a cast iron pan for the table. We were very happy with the dining experience but make sure you have plenty of credit available on your credit card because you will need it!",

From the beet salad to the short ribs and crab legs, EVERYTHING is beyond delicious. I am in love with Steak 44",

Last year all I can say is, we were not wowed. For that kind of money, we should be delighted. Instead it seemed just ok and a little \"tired\". So we searched for a new place this year. Talk about being wowed! The monstrous shrimp priced at $7 each were so worth it. Our steaks were amazingly tender, seasoned to perfection and served on these searing hot plates. The creamed corn brulee was ridiculously good. The only thing that didn't know our socks off was the butter cake type dessert served with caramel sauce. However the chocolate brioche bread pudding more than made up for it...outstanding.   The decor is inviting...it appealed to us in that it was upscale and trendy without being pretentious. We are retired but there were lots of much younger people there. Next time we will request one of the cozy and romantic booths tucked towards the back.   This restaurant is owned by Maestro's (apparently they have sold the original Maestro's restaurants and are now branching out with this and Dominicks (which we haven't tried. All I can say is, I know where I will be come July to celebrate my birthday!",

I ordered the pomegranate Martini and my girlfriend ordered the strawberry drink which was both really good!  The restaurant was really nice and enjoyed our anniversary dinner.

We were there to celebrate a birthday, and the importance of this celebration was not lost on Daniel, the assistant manager. We got warm welcome from everyone. The place was beautifully decorated. We were lucky to have a table with full view of the open kitchen. Being a huge foodie fan, I was over the top with happiness with the location of our table. On to the food. We started off with some blue point oysters which were amazingly fresh and delicious. We were tempted to order more, if it wasn't for the fact that we ordered a lot of food.  Our next dish was the Rhode Island calamari and shrimp. It was perfectly seasoned. The little kick we get from the jalapeno was the perfect contrast. The  super colossal shrimps were out of this world. It's a meal in itself. Thank you Daniel for sending these deliciousness to our table. We feel the love. The 22 oz bone-in ribeye cooked medium push per our request. It was tender and flavorful. The seared ahi tuna was light and refreshing. Alaskan crab & shrimp mash potato , and the roasted brussels sprouts  were the perfect accompaniment for the steak and ahi tuna. The tree with beignet blossoms totally wrapped up our perfect night. Thank you sous chef Hung Hoang for the wonderful treat. I'll be back for sure!! Bon Appetit!!",

My boss has been here many times and has been raving about it, so when my Grandma proclaimed she wanted steak for her birthday, this was the first place that came to mind.  The Hubs and I have been to Dominick's, so we figured to expect something of that caliber and we were right.  The staff leading up to the big dinner was extremely help.  They confirmed our reservation multiple times and accommodated my request for a quiet table (past the kitchen in the back).  The set-up was perfect and we were seated right at our reservation time.  Our waiter was very patient and helpful.  He was friendly, but not overbearing and answered any and all questions our party had.  My sister and I shared the filet, the \"mashed,\" and creme brule corn.  Everything was hot, cooked to our specifications, and delish.  I especially loved the corn.  The table also shared the sauteed shrimp appetizer and potato crisps.  Both were good, as was the bread, which was served hot before the meal.  We didn't partake in dessert because we brought a cake, but the staff did cut it for us, which was super helpful and nice.  All in all, we had a great dinner at Steak 44.  My family, including my Grandma, is still raving about it.  The restaurant followed up the next day to see how everything went, which I think is a nice touch.  I look forward to going back for our next special occasion.",

We also always ask for a booth in the back by the kitchen- and by chance we typically get Nicholas. We haven't had many other servers there, but I am confident to say that he's got to be one of their best. We ate the colossal shrimp cocktail, rack of lamb, and King crab with drawn butter. For sides we got the mushrooms, corn brulee (one of my all time favorite things) and fries. Everything was delicious although I probably wouldn't get the fries again. Cocktails were fabulous - boozy but you could still taste all the flavors intended. We are never disappointed and will be back shortly for my husbands birthday! Thanks Steak 44 for the memories.",

We ordered drinks and an appetizer, the pork belly, it came out and was great. We awaited our main course, never did our waitress ask if we wanted another drink from the bar, and when our food arrived it was less then impressive. I had the rack of lamb and my husband the large filet with the bone in. I have honestly had better service and food from Chili's Bar and Grill. I am so far beyond disappointed in the service and food tonight, had a manager even bothered to make rounds I would of shared this opinion, but again I guess Steak 44 is just not of the same caliber of Capital Grill, Mortons and Flemings.",

The meatballs that they advertised on AZ Central a while back were a bit dry but they took it off my bill so no complaints there. The filet was on point. The braised pork belly was a little too sweet for my liking but that didn't stop me from eating all of it. Definitely will bring the DH back for some steak. And, did I mention that the service was superb!",

REALLY? Yes...Really.  Now that is stupid.  What is up with that?  The hostess was sweet and the manager seemed interested in knowing how I felt about the $20 martini: steak was good not great. Bread was ok. And the beignets for dessert were hard and dry... But I liked the hostess and manager.",

My only complaint is that there's too many good things on the menu to choose from! I'm on a health kick and avoiding red meat so sadly, I did not order a filet as I normally would. I ended up ordering a caesar salad which is large enough to be a dinner salad. It comes with a poached egg on top which is one of my favorite things (fried would have been awesome too). I recommend it! I also ordered two of the colossal cocktail shrimp. These things are CRAZY big, like the size of my hand and come with the most amazing horseradish I think I've ever had! It takes a lot to live up to my spiciness standards and they totally killed it. I also ordered some of the crunchy shrimp to split with my friend as an app (not part of my diet I know I know). Boy was it effing amazing! Probably the best shrimp dish I've ever had! I'll order that every time I go and it truly is crunchy. I always worry about things advertised and crunchy as I'm usually disappointed. I think it's the best thing on the menu and I didn't miss the steak at all. I also have to say the Mac and cheese looked so amazing and I was super jealous of that! All and all a great place to go for a special occasion!",

They went above and beyond to accommodate and welcome us. We started with two lobster sized shrimp and a sampling of oysters. Next, we had the wedge salad. It was crisp and flavorful served on a chilled plate which is a nice detail. For our entree, we had the bone in rib eyes, sauteed spinach and crab mashed potatoes. The only negative here was the inferno hot plate the steaks were served on. It took close to 10 minutes for them to cool down. This was fairly annoying especially because we were ready to eat and didn't want to wait for our food to cool. The steaks were still incredible. Dessert was an amazing butter and Carmel cake. The service from beginning to end was top notch. This restaurant makes it to the top of our list of favorites. Nice work, Steak 44!!!!",

We all have we have to do these programs every where. I thought I would try here,even though I did hear one bad review from a friend of mine... I really wish I would've went to capital Grille or Donavans... This was some of the worst service I've ever had. First they wanted to charge me $420 for their \"AV equipment\" They totally skimped on the side dishes... Only bringing one small vegetable one small potato per table They never offered any side dishes or deserts to my speaker??? Really? No coffee was served or offered to anyone? I had 21 guests but still was going to be eight people short... Which adds up to $1000 that I give the restaurant for no food... So I asked to wrap two meals up so it would only be $700 that I'm giving the restaurant for no food and they were total jerks about it and of course only wrapped up in one piece of steak without any of the accompanying items? For $250 I got two pieces of steak! Wow Obviously when you have a contract you pay the money but I've never had a restaurant provide such horrible service and then overcharge me for the AV When I brought this all to their attention they're like oh here's the credit for your AV... Never even commenting on the other items. What is totally ridiculous...you know if you're in the restaurant they are piling the food and drinks on...the more the better...but in the private dining room you can't even get a cup of coffee??? Because they know...they are getting $2700++ regardless. I will never book here again and I hope all my colleagues stay away as well.",

Then we got the crispy shrimp with chilli sauce it was perfectly fried with the perfect amount of sauce on it. for the meal I got the meatloaf, and my husband got the rib eye. Those as well are fabulous. For our sides we got bacon Brussels sprouts which I'm not a huge fan of Brussels sprouts but even I liked them and my husband died over them. The lobster mac and cheese that was good but not my favorite. The Dominic's potatoes those are wonderful I definitely suggest those (had them for breakfast today almost better than last night!) and last but not least the cream corn and I dreamed about that last night. It was the best thing I think I've ever eaten. Ever. Our waiter Rob was so nice and you could tell he's been doing this for a long time because he was on top of it. He surprised us with the butter cake and had them write happy anniversary on the plate. That as well was mouth watering. We had a great time. Definitely coming back!",

I'm so glad we didn't order an appetizer or salad. The portions are very generous and we were both stuffed. The lamb was very well seasoned. One piece of lamb was cooked better than the other in my opinion. Because it was our anniversary, our waitress was kind enough to give us a complimentary dessert. We tried the red velvet bread pudding. I'm usually not a big bread pudding person, but this was delicious. I loved the top where it was slightly burnt and crunchy. The rest was like eating a warm red velvet cake fresh out of the oven. The service was great, definitely a 5-star type of restaurant, which I wasn't really expecting. I will definitely add this place to my list!",

    "text": "I may have found my new favorite steakhouse.  One caveat...my meal was paid for by a business associate.  As a result, we sampled a ton of food.  The seafood tower was super and that in itself really was enough for dinner.  The stone crab claws, oysters, king crab, lobster, shrimp were all fantastic.  I love devilled eggs and here they serve them deep fried.  Really cool.  We then ordered the Wagyu Beef.  Like butter it melted in my mouth and was cooked to perfection.  Our sides included spinach, mac n cheese, fried asparagus.  I could have made meal on the sides.  Our waiter was awesome and super attentive.  The GM came to our table a couple of times to check on our experience.  I guess that is what happens when you have a $2000 bill for 5 people.  I have two concerns.  I thought the side dish portions were on the small side and the wine menu which is great does not cater to the average person.  We were drinking $200 - $350 dollar bottles of wine.  I just think there should be more offerings than Meiomi for $45 for the average person.  Based on my experience, I would rate this a little higher than Maestro's City Hall.  What a great night!",

Seating took us on a tour of restaurant with many open seats and places us in the back on what was an old patio when prior restaurant.  Last table in the place across from service station.  Since it was quiet, I did not object--just wanted to have a pleasant evening.  I gladly admit the steak was very tasty and the food generally was all very good.  My complaint is with the staff.  We are seating in an areas with candles at every table except ours.  The waitress tried again and again to keep it lite--why not get a new candle?  She seemed determined to do it her way instead of just getting a new one.  Hot towels were delivered at end of meal--a nice touch if they had not been overpowering with the smell of lavender.  Not that I object to lavender smell, it was overpowering in a room when others are still eating--smells like cleaning detergent until you find out what it is.  Generally we were not happy with the service, but did not make a complaint--only do that if we plan on returning so they get it right next times.  Since not going back they can do whatever they want!",

The wine list is really nice and not terribly overpriced like so many restaurants in this category are, thank you for that!!

Our server was super nice, but super pushy trying to get us to buy more and add more. (I'm a server so I know the difference between recommendations and when it's being overdone.) I'm guessing it was just because we didn't order any alcohol. Our table wasn't very nice for a special occasion and we were in later when there were plenty of empty tables available. It was a two-chair table, to the right was a wall, to the left was a window facing an outside wall and behind my chair was a server station which we got to hear the servers talking about who's going to be closing and who made money and who didn't. My boyfriend loved his food (Ribeye). I liked the Short Rib, the bordelaise sauce was really good. Not a huge fan of the asparagus fries, a bit soggy. Unfortunately the busser forgot to put the box with my boyfriends steak in the to-go bag so that was a little disappointing when we went to eat our leftovers. The restrooms are very clean and I like that its a one private room. We also got a courtesy call the next day which was a good touch for business. Too bad we didn't notice our steak was missing before they called! :(",

    "text": "This place gets 3 of its 4 stars just because they have the butter cake on the menu.  Really though, it was a great experience. It was all the good stuff about Mastro's but with slightly lower prices and fewer pretentious weirdos. We came for a friend's 30th birthday and I will DEFINITELY be coming back. They actually had a few cuts of meat that aren't on Mastro's menu (and a few missing that are staples at their sister restaurant). I shared the 44oz bone-in ribeye with another girlfriend, which was the perfect portion size for the two of us. The butter on top was heavenly, as always. But the apps are really what did it for me.  My boyfriend and I started with the meatballs and the braised pork belly (hey, if pork belly is on the menu, you ALWAYS order the pork belly). Both were amazingly melt-in-your-mouth and very filling portions for two people.  With dinner, we ordered the following sides to share between a group of 6:  the mashed (4 stars) mac & cheese (5 stars) vidalia onion strings (if 6 stars existed, that's what these would be) wild mushrooms (didn't try. i hate mushrooms)  Finally, it was dessert time. Now if you've never had the butter cake from Mastro's, I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that you have not fully lived. You NEED to eat this stuff. It needs to be on your bucket list, you need to eat the whole thing by yourself, and you need to not share any with anyone no matter how much you love them. They can get their own and they will thank you for it. One bite may or may not give you diabetes, just be prepared for that.  So my boyfriend and I obviously got one of those, and we also shared the s'mores in a jar. It was deliciously mallow-y and gooey. If I had to choose between the two desserts, obviously s'mores would lose every time (sorry, s'mores), but it's definitely number 2 on the list!  Go here, eat too much, and enjoy every minute of it. Great experience.",

    "text": "Actual rating is 4.5 stars, which is very impressive for a restaurant that has been open just one week.  One thing to appreciate about the Mastros team is that they know what they do well and do not greatly depart from it. They really have the steakhouse formula down to a science and so Steak 44 is just the logical extension of what they have historically excelled at. The core of the menu is expertly cooked steaks and seafood, ala carte traditional sides (with some twists), raw bar, cocktails and good selection of wine.  I had heard that Steak 44 was intended to be a more casual and less expensive concept than some previous ventures. It doesn't seem to me that it is really less expensive, but it is a bit more casual. The interior of the place is drop dead amazing. It one of the best look restaurants in the state and is sort of compartmentalized, which helps with noise and privacy while still keeping you in the action. Our favorite \"compartments\" are the booths that have a glass wall shared by the kitchen. That is a very risky thing for a restaurant to do, but it really lets you be in the furious action of the kitchen, while shielded from noise and heat.  As for the menu, the Mastro folks have decide to offer some smaller choices, which has been a \"complaint\" at other venues (all you really need to do is split things, though). There are smaller steaks and larger steaks. The salads, sides and desserts are now individual size versus shareable, which allows for a lighter meal or the ability to try more items.  The great: deep fried deviled eggs, raw bar, perfectly cooked steaks, halibut, brussel sprouts, tempura asparagus, cocktails, sorbets. The halibut was probably the tastiest and most skillfully cooked halibut i've had in a long time.  Could use work: the bread course (bread balls browned in a cast iron skillet with herbed butter) - messy and not that good, steakhouse stuffing (seems like the same bread balls reformatted) - unexciting and lacking in texture.  The service was excellent, balancing cordiality with professionalism, which is a tough balance to hit. Our waiter, AJ, was very knowledgeable and paced the meal appropriately.  I am very impressed with this new undertaking by the Mastros team, particularly with how well executed it is right from the start.",

The wine list was really good and they past Veuve Champagne around for everyone for a toast at 6pm. Great impression. My husband did not necessarily have the Same opinion  We were seated and anxiously wanting to try many items.   Veal meatball appetizer sounded fabulous. We ordered one for 3.  Shares a filet.  Ordered Rack of Lamb.  Lobster mashed potatoes.  Chopped salad.  Stone crabs and  butter cake for dessert   Meatballs were dry and marginal at best.   Lobster mashed potatoes were surprisingly marginal as well.  Surprised something like this wouldn't be fabulous. Large lumps of lobster however.   Stone crabs appeared to be the best item ordered.    Rack of Lamb was good. Spiced well.  No sauce on side or even a drizzle of mint   That would have been nice.   Chopped salad was enjoyed but to me very boring. My husband enjoyed it   Nothing to speak about.   Butter cake is loved by people eating in general but not this one. Sadly it was dry. But good flavor.   I almost gave a 3 atar but a 2.5 at best  Part of disappointment was hype of new restaurant.   Overall hard pressed to believe it could compete in this market.   Bar was a good selection. They may survive on that alone. But can't be for long.   Sad and disappointed. Thought it might be my new favorite.",

The steak was great however the person who decided to add a pound of salt to the outside for seasoning clearly made a big boo boo. I only could finish half my steak because it was so salty, and it wasn't just mine every persons steak at the table was the same. We also had the oysters. I would recommend a pass on these. We had a few on here that were on the border of turning and I wouldn't call them fresh in any sort. I would recommend they switch their distributor.",

We went once just as a couple and another time with 3 other couples.  When the group of us was there, the service was ok, nothing special or particularly attentive.  We ordered a seafood tower and when I placed some cocktail sauce on my plate, a screw fell out.  As a way to \"make up for it\" they gave us a donut tree???   Maybe  it was that we are on the younger side and the other tables looked more promising or just didn't had a great experience but I don't think we will be rushing back.  The food was among the lines of the other steakhouse in the valley but nothing great.  I think the high point was the seafood tower even with the screw:)",

I  am literally hopping on Yelp on the way home from the restaurant because I am so thrilled with our experience. First off, it was our anniversary and there was a hand written congratulations note on our table when we arrived. The service was impeccable, from our official waiter to the server, just both lovely, attentive but unobtrusive. I had the filet and king crab legs and it was divine. We also got the corn brulee, which is basically a creamed corn with the top brulee'd. So yummy! Yes dinner for two people who are ordering high cost items is expensive but I think it was worth every penny. Just fantastic. And you can see they wrote a message on the dessert",

The food came out shortly after and the manager came back out asking how everything was. I was completely blown away by their customer service!

    "text": "I took my parents here for dinner while they were in town. Their steak here is exceptional. The steak is served to you in a sizzling plate that keeps the cut hot for the entire course of the meal. They have a great selection of cuts, non of which are too fatty or lean.   The meal starts off with fresh garlic bread in a sort of pan. The best way I can describe it is a group of buns baked in a pan with oil and garlic brushed over it. We got the calamari and the pork belly for appetizers. The calamari/shrimp combo had a great light batter that wasn't heavy but maintained a terrific crisp. The pork belly was a little on the sweet side for me because of the sweet chili they drizzled over it. I'd recommend asking to forego it.   I ordered a KC bone-in cut with foie gras while my parents got a bone-in ribeye and a meatloaf. The steaks were all phenomenal. I would say the foie gras wasn't worth the extra 18 dollars so would recommend using your money to get an extra side or something. My parents complained that the meatloaf had a very sweet barbecue sauce brushed over it that really detracted from the heartiness of the meatloaf. If you're into barbecue sauce go for it I guess. Sides are done a la carte here. We got the mushrooms and the Brussels sprouts both really good. We finished off the meal with some sorbet that was just sweet enough to satisfy without making you feel like getting a headache later.  I would definitely recommend coming here for a nice dinner and excellent steak!",

    "text": "It's taken a few days to compose this review... there are not enough adjectives to help me. So let's start off with this; it was spectacular!!!   I decided for my 45th birthday to splurge a little on myself, I researched the best restaurant in Phoenix and constantly Steak 44 was the top of the list. I made reservations and impatiently waited. The wait was worth it. As I talked with friends most flat out would say \"I don't go to steak houses, they don't grill as good as I do.\" Well, they are wrong!!! I'm no slouch in the kitchen, but I'll never be as good as what I ate.   I started off with a table in the bar. I was a little annoyed with my placement, I like the pomp of being at a table, but since I was dinning alone I felt I would be a little more inconspicuous sitting at the bar.  I ordered a drink and took in the ambience. I ordered the knife and fork salad. The server wanted to take my full order but I asked to wait and she obliged. The salad came and it was wonderful, the ice berg lettuce was a great conveyance for the blue cheese and bacon. If I had a critique it would be to add some red onion or balsamic vinegar to help cut the fat.   The server started some small talk and I told her it was my birthday (yes I wanted my free dessert). She was very nice, told me she has been there for three months and has enjoyed it. I then ordered my steak, the NY Strip with blue cheese and potatoes au gratin. My mouth salivated with anticipation.   The steak came out and I was not disappointed. I just can't wordsmith enough about how good it was. So I will leave it at that... it was good.   So good.  So very good...   They then brought me out my birthday dessert. It was the most amazing dessert I've had in a while. It sits right below the chocolate birthday cake my mom used to make. It was a chocolate bread pudding with ice cream. Even the cup of coffee was good.   A lot might think it was sad having a solo birthday dinner, but I do me good. I did me great!  It may be a while until I get back... but I shall be back...",

The waitress greeted us and went thru the whole menu with us and even food that was off menu. I ordered the bone in rib-eye medium rare and she ordered the filet.  I must say that their rib eye was AMAZINGLY tender and flavorful. I only eat rib eye cuts and have to say this one is the best by far.  The sides don't come with the meal so you have to pay extra for a salad and any other sides.  Their baked potato was amazing too.  Started eating it and the center was perfect. It's kind of pricey but well worth it.  Very nice dining experience.  If you like amazing food and like getting pampered by the staff then you have to check out Steak 44.",

I would give 5 stars but my reservation was for 7:15 and I wasn't sat until 7:45. They reassured me many times it would only be a couple minutes and people kept asking me what I was waiting for. The reservation noted it was my birthday but they didn't do any of the \"personalized\" touches that are advertised. I think the communication could've been better, and I really would have loved the handwritten card that they promised. Overall a great experience, I will definitely be returning maybe not for celebrations though.",

Great steak, raw bar, sides, desserts etc. I don't drink, but they have an extensive wine list. Bone in filet or KC strip are amazing. King crab mac and cheese and the corn creme brulee are my favorite sides, but all are great. Food is A+ and service is A+++. The only steakhouse I have been to that is better is Peter Luger in Brooklyn, which is considered one of the top 5 in the world. I put Steak on par with Abe & Louies in Boston and it is wayyy better than Capitol Grille. It's expensive, but you get what you pay for so I highly recommend.",

The oysters (and entire raw bar) are awesome as well. Save room for beignets or the butter cake, they are both delicious!   Parking, including getting to the valet, can be a bit if a gongshow.",

After my last review about a bad experience, management reached out and invited me back in hopes to make things right, so I agreed and went back.   This experience could not have been more different than my first time around. We were sat right away when we walked in. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful. Spending plenty of time explaining the menu, specials and drinks.   Pork Belly and Calamari were the appetizers and they were delicious. Filet Mignon and a Wagyu Rib Eye were the entree's we had and both of our steaks were cooked perfectly. They were delicious, I couldn't have been happier.   They sent out a tree of Beignet's with dipping sauce and a vanilla cake for dessert and again. It was incredible.   Based on the 2nd experience i had here I will obviously be back. Management and the staff obviously care about your experience and genuinely want you to enjoy yourself. Give this place a shot, it is definitely worth it.",

    "text": "I am not originally from Phoenix, but my family came to visit from California for Thanksgiving and my dad wanted to try this place out after all the great things he had read about the place.  Since it was thanksgiving, I needed to have some turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes, so I ordered the thanksgiving special. However, since this is a steakhouse, I did not base the majority of my review on my thoughts of my own meal. The turkey could have been more moist, but with the delicious gravy, it worked. The stuffing was pretty mushy, but the mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious.   Complimentary dinner rolls are brought to the table almost immediately and they were deliciously buttery and warm. We then ordered 3 appetizers: the crispy shrimp deviled eggs, pork belly, and calamari & shrimp. I personally don't eat pork belly, but my brother and dad loved the dish. The crispy shrimp deviled eggs were good, but I think next time I would order the crispy shrimp by itself. The calamari was a tad big over cooked and the squid came out a little harder than I would have liked, but the shrimp was delicious. For main dishes, my brother ordered the butcher's cut and my mom ordered the main filet mignon. Both cuts were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly to the temperature desired. We also ordered chef Watson's potatoes, sugar snap peas, and the corn creme brulee. All were delicious and were great accompaniments to the steak and the sides are served to you if that is preferred! If I had to pick one, I would have to choose the corn creme brulee. For dessert, we ordered s'mores in a jar and the vanilla caramel cake. Both were divine and were a great finale to a great meal.  Overall, I would definitely come back for a special occasion. Service was great and the occasion felt appropriately fancy. The restaurant is huge and I could see a lot of things going wrong because of the size, but I enjoyed every part of the meal.",

Just wanted to add a quick follow up to this review. After posting I was contacted by the GM. He apologized for the miscommunication and invited our party back in for dinner. Service was phenomenal! Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was amazing and cooked to perfection. Although my past experience was not what I expected they definitely made it right the second time. I'll definitely be back for sure.",

I was excited to experience the food but as soon as I received my steak the first two bites was great then in the middle of the steak I realized my steak was raw and it was not as I ordered it medium well.  And when I alerted our server and the chef took my steak from my plate and re-cooked it and then returned it and placed it on my plate.  I thought that was inappropriate and unhealthy.  There were four of us and out of the four three of us returned our steak. When it was re-cooked the taste of the stake was not the same as the first time.  For the price we paid I was disappointed.  I don't think I will go back to this restaurant again.",

    "text": "Words cannot express how amazing dinner was here. We came here from my birthday dinner. First parking situation is not a problem. Second I have to give a shout out to everyone who works there. They make sure everyone is happy and are enjoying their dining experience. Great customer service! Wish more places were like this! Alright time for the food part. I've provided photos of each.   Appetizer: We started off with chefs pb&j which was a pate which consisted of fig jam and woodford borboun reserve. We've had pate before and so this wasn't a new experience....but the texture and after taste didn't settle well. It was the least favorite part of our experience, but our waiter was so attentive and asked what we thought...I am very animated so my face said it all despite trying to be polite about it. Manager came in and said not to worry and offered another appetizer, but we said we were okay. Instead they removed the item from our bill. I was very impressed that they cared soo much.   Entree:  This is where the stuff is to die for! We both ordered a 22 ounce bone in rib eye, medium rare. So to be fair I just had a rib eye the night before at Fleming's....so I was able to compare the two . Hands down Steak 44 rib eye cooked better, seasoned better and better cut of meat. It was delicious! I couldn't finish it all but wow! Let me tell you delicious!  Sides:  Chef Watson's potatoes: with caramelized onion, Gouda and mozzarella. It was a great addition to our steak. Yummy for sure. We also had the creamy Mac and cheese with provel, romano, and tillamook cheddar. Ohh the cheese combo was delicious and creamy in texture. Mac and cheese was not too dry and the texture was great. One of my fave Mac and cheeses.   Dessert:  Well it was my birthday and I was given the option of a free dessert. I decided on the beignets that were covered in powdered sugar and hanging on cute tree. You could dip in a vanilla or chocolate sauce. I must say presentation of this dessert was very impressive. Wait....surprise! They give me an additional free dessert for my bday: caramel butter cake (don't quite remember the name). Best butter cake ever! Melted in my mouth and just ended the night perfectly. Between the two desserts I liked the butter cake better.   Alcoholic beverage: I had the orange rye old fashioned which was delicious ! My boyfriend had the French old fashioned which I tried and was smoother to drink...but I know what ryes are about so They finish differently but the orange rye it self was a great drink. Great flavor profile and not too over powering in the orange. They have a ton of cocktails, scotch, wine to choose from.   Atmosphere: It's a very big seating area. Different parts of the restaurant from the bar area, to private party/business meeting area, to cozy intimate areas where you can watch the chef and team prepare food, and regular dinning area. As you enter there is a cool wall of butcher knives and a big storage/wine cellar area. The whole dining experience ambience was more on the upscale side and the decor and wall art and seating was impressive.   Overall:  Definitely deserves 5 stars between the atmosphere, food and drinks and great service. I highly would recommend this place to anyone. Great....I mean great steak and amazing service. More restaurants should be modeled after their great service.",

Their bread is amazing but don't fill up on it. All their sides taste amazing and can be a meal in itself if you have a vegetarian friend. The staff pays a lot of attention to you.

I had it prepared medium well plus (whatever that means), and for the sides I ordered some corn, mash potatoes, macaroni and cheese, along with this bleu cheese melts ooey gooey sauce to top my steak.

    "text": "My visit to Steak 44 steakhouse started as a bitter one, but it got transformed to a sweet and lovely night at the end, thanks to Triple Js. Although I dislike long reviews, this one of mine might be a very long one so apologies in advance!   Reserving a table was easy breezy thanks to the Open Table app.  Got seated soon after arriving which was very nice considering that the restaurant was super busy. It didn't take very long until it became evident that the table is in the middle of the way where even our waiter almost dropped the menus while passing our table. Yes, it was that bad. To make things even worse, there were plenty of LOUD guests that just wanted to yell instead of talking normally. I perfectly understand, perhaps one of the most precious traits that we Homo Sapians Sapians have, is the ability to speak. Having said that I don't enjoy being in super loud places while eating. And that is exactly where this visit started to change course.   After letting the waiter know that we would like to be moved, we were approached by one of the managers named Jake. He apologized for the situation and directed us to a dining room in the back of the kitchen area that was called the \"800s room\". The room had no more than 8 tables which was perfect and lovely and away from  alllll the loud crowd.   Soon after Josh our waiter and his assistant, John introduced themselves and made the dining experience very pleasant.   Now, it is worthy to review the food itself. The super food salad was tasty. The Jumbo shrimp cocktail was Double Super Jumbo. I am not sure if these shrimps are genetically modified to be this jumbo but they were delicious. As for the main course, it was suggested to us to order the off-menu special of wagyu steak. The suggestion was accepted and ordered sauteed corn as the side of choice. The wagyu steak was amazing. Although I am not a big fan of medium cooked steak, the plate that it was served in was soooooo HOT that the steak was cooked to my liking after is was served which was perfect.   If you ever visit Phoenix, you should try to dine at this restaurant. I have had plenty of great tasting steaks in the past, this steak is among my top 3 steaks that I have ever eaten. If the Triple Js (Jake, Josh & John) were not involved in this dining experience, this review would have been a solid 3 star review, but they saved the day or night along with this review!",

    "text": "Exceptional dining with even better customer service!    My wife and I have been looking forward to dining at steak 44 for some time. We had lived several miles north and were regulars at another famous steak house. Having moved to PV we decided this year to celebrate Father's day with a dinner at steak 44. We entered the restaurant and were immediately impressed by the warm and welcoming surroundings. Staff that we passed as we were led to a table went out of their way to welcome us with expressions like Good evening and welcome in. It was as if we were entering someone's home and meeting members of the family. We soon met our waiter who was welcoming and courteous and immediately launched into the beginnings of the meal. I started with some scotch and the pork belly appetizer along with an order of oysters on the half shell. What a wonderful beginning to meal. The pork belly was crispy and flavorful bathed in a delicious glaze and resting upon a bed of steamed spinach. The oysters were fresh and served with an array of condiments.  The waiter described the offerings that evening both on and off of the menu and of we both ordered the bone-in ribeye medium rare.       As fate would have it when the steaks were delivered the waiter read from the delivery receipt and mentioned that one of the steaks had been prepared  medium. We reminded him that they both had been ordered medium rare. This event began a cascade of customer service events the likes of which I have never experienced. It was as if the DEFCON 4 alert had been sounded! All hands on deck. Before ever setting down upon our table the two steaks in question were instantly whisked away even though one of them was indeed cooked to order. The waiter was immediately at our side reviewing his notes and confirming our requests and upon realizing the error marched off to the kitchen appearing far more upset over the incident than we were. In his place the manager seemed to instantly materialize. This man was so contrite and apologetic that we found ourselves wanting to apologize to him for creating such a stir. In a blink two new steaks and sides appeared at our table perfectly prepared. The steaks were exceptional. If you are a conoseur of ribeye then you know it is all about the char and these steaks did not disappoint. They were prepared more perfectly than any ribeye I have ever eaten anywhere  and that is no exaggeration.  To cap off this exceptional meal we shared coffee and a slice of their vanilla caramel cake, which can only be described as intoxicating. As I said, my wife and I have dined at other major steakhouses in Scottsdale and Troon for decades and this meal rivaled or surpassed all of them.      We enjoyed an absolutely lovely evening of fine dining at steak 44 but, the most miraculous part is yet to come.  It would have been considerate to have provided dessert for the inconvenience of the \"incident\", but no, when the check arrived the manager had covered the cost of both steaks and sides. We were shocked!   I called the waiter to the table and questioned this.  I explained that it was completely unnecessary and that we understood that things like this happen. He said it was their policy at the restaurant that everything needed to be perfect. I have never experienced that level of customer service in any restaurant anywhere. Certainly in my 50 years I have had more than one or two items arrive at my table not properly prepared. As I explained when it happened last night, \"these things happen\". Well, apparently, they don't happen at steak 44. Service with a bar that high is nearly unheard of in this day and age. I'm not one to throw faint praise and rarely if ever write a Yelp review. But, in this case I had to make an exception. Any establishment that goes this far out of its way to assure that its customers have an excellent dining experience has to be respected. The combination of exceptional food and unrivaled customer service puts Steak 44 head and shoulders above the competition. They have earned a regular for life!",

    "text": "Steak 44 is magical. The bread was the perfect texture, the mashed potatoes and crab Mac& cheese were so flavorful and that lobster was tender. Heaven. Our waiter gave us this pizookie that tasted like cake batter. I felt so taken care of. I can't wait to come back.   Date Rating: 3 out of 5.  Wade didn't think our first date was actually a date. He claims he doesn't understand how dating works. Alright fine. On that date he said he wouldn't take me to his favorite restaurant. Between then and now that tune had changed. It was the perfect place for a first date. Candlelight and a secluded corner table, very romantic. At one point Wade said something about how he felt relationships are a partnership 50-50. I told him I would agree but statistically, women do a lot more work. Emotionally take care of their men, the house, kids, all while working. He said I wouldn't have to worry about that because he wasn't emotional... I felt it was ironic that 10 minutes later he was explaining to me why he broke up with his exes and didn't even ask me anything about myself. It was all him, him, him. Does that seem 50-50 to you? Lol it's because I know that this is typically how things go for me that I wanna put in very little effort. Why exert myself when he gets all the benefit? Dinner was amazing and I laughed a lot to keep myself entertained. I had to raise my eyebrow when he said he was better in bed than any vibrator I owned. I know I will be disappointed when a man thinks he has to compete with a sex toy... it's sad because there's no competition. It's immature to even argue about it. He made an offer for me to sleep over at his place the next night and it was then that I realized this probably wouldn't work out because I was mortified by the idea. When he made a comment about this date being the most he had ever spent on one and equal to a car payment, I knew I was done. I could never be with someone so subtlety tacky. When he walked me to my car he kissed me and I fantasized about all my exes who were fantastic kissers. For a split second I missed Alex :/ A couple days later I told Wade he made me very underwhelmed and he went ahead and blocked me on Instagram. I'm very against ghosting so I'm happy with this outcome.",

It's the BEST ever! It's like a flower of pull apart buns that's baked in a skillet and is served directly from the oven to the table... it's melt in the mouth goodness of garlic and butter! Yummm The steak is cooked to perfection every time. The steak literally sizzles on your plate! My 2 boys 11 and 9 shared the 12 oz filet mignon ($52) and wiped it clean. My husband had the petit filet ($48) with blue cheese crust about $6 extra. Their chopped salad was delicious. I highly recommend their hasselback potatoes, perfectly cooked with truffle oil and a cream cheese chive dip, too good! sides are around $11  The wine selection is very good and very well priced. You can find bottles from $30 to $500 + Our server Brian was EXCELLENT. From start to finish he executed over order to perfection. My husband wanted to try 2 new wines and he was kind enough to bring a tasting for both! Both wines were excellent. He also got me a free dessert, warm caramel butter cake (yummmmm) with vanilla ice cream  (for my bday and a special dessert crispy banana Sunday  for my boys!  Our experience at steak 44 has always been stellar, I feel now do we need to make a trip to Phoenix just to dine at steak 44!!??!!",

We went there on recommendations for the steak and did not read reviews.  The meat was good but the presentation was not.  This would be my first time having my clothes get spattered by hot sizzling grease! Steak doesn't need to be served on a sizzling plate, as the steak is still cooking past desired doneness.  All that butter is not necessary for a decent cut of meat, either. The Brussels sprouts were noticeably undercooked and no amount of bacon saute was going to help that.  The coffee was weak.  The waiter did not ask if the meals were okay. I thought this was a miss all around compared to comparable steak houses we enjoy.  I can see where a younger clientele would enjoy it but not those used to fine dining.",

Definitely an entree for two.  Experience: Fresh oysters to start Notable side: Corn creme brulee (an absolute must) Service: Excellent  Should have ordered the beignets for dessert but had no room!  Overall, 4 stars. The only con is that we were seated at a table with no direct lighting from the ceiling. Even with the candle, it was a bit hard to see. The table adjacent to us had ample lighting and through observation, it seemed that other tables were fine as well. It definitely dimmed the steak experience. The food was amazing. It would have been a 5 star experience had we gotten the chance to gawk at how beautiful the steak was.",

Through word of mouth and reading other rave reviews, I knew dinner would be good, but I wasn't prepared for it to send my palate to heaven.   Steak 44 was SO good, in fact, that I find it hard imagining myself eating a steak from any other restaurant! I do not exaggerate when I say their bone-in Rib-eye was the best steak I have EVER eaten. 22 ounces of pure bliss cooked medium per the Chef's recommendation so the marbling could melt into the steak. Add in some lobster mashed potatoes and baked cream spinach, and you have pure food porn.  The hostesses seemed a bit dazed, as we arrived for our 8:45pm reservation. My finely tuned F&B ears picked up some confusion in the seating arrangements, as we waited awkwardly for about 12 minutes. Something about a large party being broken down and a couple already sat at 606, the table where we were supposed to be sat. Nothing major, but then again, nothing that your customers, especially at such a nice establishment, should be hearing. But after this little setback, the food and exceptional service provided by John blew us away, and we had a wonderful evening!   If Steak 44 wasn't on your bucket list, it should be now!",

All of the seafood in flown in fresh daily. You can definitely tell. So good. I got the special Waygu beef and holy crap was it amazing. So incredibly tender. If you have never had Waygu, you have to get try it here. For the sides, we go many. The burlee corn (or whatever it is called) was really amazing. Did not expect that at all. The spinach and bussel sprouts were also very good, but I love spinach and brussels sprouts to begin with. We also got the lobster mash which is good but my least favorite of the four. If you can afford to go, I highly recommend trying this place. So worth it.   One benefit of this place over Dominick's is the lighting is much better here. It is so dark at Dominick's for some reason. Otherwise, both places are very similar.",

We rolled in around 7 and found two spots at the bar. I love their bar menu- it lays flat so you can share between people and  offers a 'ehhuuge!' Wine selection. We cracked a bottle of their Nozzole 12' from Chianti and it was sooo delicious!  The bartender, (ladies, he was some sort of handsome line-backer) was super gracious and had all the service points I would go back just to have him service me again! Lol but really, in all professional sense, we never had to touch the bottle he always kept our glasses full. Great timing, great suggestions for me and he made an extra effort to make sure that my order came out perfect. He was awesome!  My vegan meal- he suggested 3 steamed veggies over pasta, and a side of French fries (yeah!)  and moreover it was evident that he was making sure that me Joe had the comfort to relax and catch up after almost a year!  Great energy! The bar was full the entire night-nice spot people watching! Seemed like people there were on a different level- relaxed and super social, more swanky then not! I can't remember the music thinking back- but that's because it was lost in my sensory with an overload of the good food,conversation,laughs, wine and people. Thanks Steak 44 I couldn't have asked for more.  Ps their smores dessert (layered chocolate/gram/custard)was sooo good! Joe had the lions share but I had most of the marshmallow topping on top. They also torch it right in front of you.",

Mind you, we have been to Donovan's, and we thought that was amazing. No disrespect towards Donovan's, but holy cow... this is #1 steak house in AZ, in my opinion. Their steak... prepared EXACTLY how you ask them for. Please early and take advantage of their \"early bar menu\" order their lemon drop martini. In all, this establishment is well worth it. Birthday or not, this is a must try! The only reason they received 3 1/2 stars and not 5... a Red Bull vodka should NOT be $20. I understand, this is a steakhouse. But, let's be honest a $20 Red Bull Vodka??? Mind you, it was Tito's Vodka, so shouldn't have been that pricey. Other than that... I will be returning, but already with a drink in me.",

This place whaaa recommended by a few friends so I made a reservation for my husband & i's anniversary.  Definitely a romantic place but it does get a bit loud with all the other tables so if possible you may wanna be asked to be seated or see if they have areas without large parties. Our waiter was very friendly & kind we had told him we were celebrating our anniversary and at the end he surprised us with a cake topped with gelato dessert. Also let him know I was pregnant and if he could recommmend which steak would be good well done. (Originally wanted to get the scallops but all the steak around couldn't help myself lol) my husband ordered the 32oz bone in ribeye & I had the petite filet mignon. Our sides were mushrooms, hassleback potato, & corn creme brulee. Heads up, sides are big and meant for sharing. Just a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend to anyone. I think next time I'd see if we could request a table by the kitchen to watch. Also I received a call from them today just to say \"thank you.\" Now that's good customer service!",

I've been to the steak 48 in Chicago with family in December, and this time with friends in phoenix and both with the same server Brian.  What an Amazing experience once again!!! Brian's vibrant energy and impeccable service stands out!!! Recommendations spot on!! We started with 2 of there house favorites. The crab and avocado stack and crispy shrimp. Both were AMAZING!!!! As far as steak, It's hard for me to stray from my normal steakhouse go-to petite filet mignon but Brian explained how the bone-In  filet would be just as lean and tender, but with more flavor and his passion for it won me over!! SO GLAD I DID!!! My steak was cooked to perfection!!!! I enjoyed every bite and truly without a doubt the best steak I've EVER had!!! EVER:)) The sides were delicious (corn-creme-brulee) sooooo gooooood:))). The Lavender scented warm towels after our table was cleared is such an amazing touch:)))  For dessert I already knew going in I was getting there Ultimate Warm vanilla Carmel Cake, and sorry, but there are no words that can describe how good it tasted:)) I can't wait to return!!!",

We were extremely impressed, the service was on key, the food was amazing. I have never been to a restaurant where every single bite felt like the first . Our steaks never cooled down it was simply delicious. Not only were out steaks cooked to perfection, but our Moscow mules were the best we have ever had.   Our dessert ( given to us) for our anniversary unfortunately was completely burnt but you can't complain about something that was given to you for free.. My only complaint was being at such a nice restaurant on a special night I would have wanted the manager to have greeted us and ask how our experience was ., he did greet every single table in our dining area but us.. A little disappointed however we do realize it was a Friday night and they were busy!!  I can't wait to come back again when we visit Az again!!!",

    "text": "My Wife suggested this venue as a birthday dinner for me while we were in town for the Tillman Run. She made a GREAT choice! We have nothing but GREAT reviews for the food, the waitstaff, esp Nick, the service and the ambiance.  In fact, it was probably the best meal we have had in our 20 some odd years of dining out, worldwide! Since it was a 3 hour drive from home, we wanted to be sure we dressed appropriately and checked the website, which says \"Proper Attire Required.\"  We found we were rather overdressed seeing a plethora of jeans and shorts.  NOT that we would've dressed down to tourist garb or trailer park issued attire for this locale, but a web site suggests business casual for the \"44\" and we complied.  We think others should also, to promote the upscale experience. So be it; we don't have to see it in the semi enclosed dining cubicle, just while waiting in the foyer, waiting to be seated, with other well dressed, mature diners. But how can you ignore a crying, whining baby? Seriously, does a high pitched, fidgeting infant belong in an upscale restaurant?  Isn't there somewhere it can located so as not to disturb other diners peace? I'm sure we will return for another fabulous meal in the future.  I would hope that \"some\" things might change before that time.",

The variety and depth of the menu is unlike any other steak house I have been to. The drink menu is exactly on par with the food, offering pairings for every meal. The server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in navigating the menu and gave great insight into favorites and suggestions on drinks. If you are looking for a classy night out at a high end steak house, this is definitely the place to be!  Overall: Food was fantastic Drinks were great A perfect place to have one of the best steaks you'll ever have Only complaint is it was a tad darker in the living room which made it difficult to read the menu.",

From greeting to ordering, all the way through the food and drinks...even to my dealings with the manager to comp a round of drinks for a business associate and his group of 20 in a VIP room, this went down like clockwork.  I had the 22oz Ribeye and it was MONEY, baby. Perfect medium...and the beef was probably the best quality I've ever had. I know my way around a cut of cow, and this was outstanding. The preparation was so good that, even though I ordered Bernaise on the side, I opted not to use it. One dip and I knew, the meat was so perfectly presented that the side sauce only detracted.  If you're in town, GO HERE. That's all I can think to say. Do it.",

    "text": "We were in town for a few days for a company conference. My boss and I wanted at least one great meal while we were away in celebration of the success we have enjoyed thus far this year. I was tasked with finding this great establishment. No pressure!  We wanted steak. Great steak. So after a review of the top 15 places in the area, I decided to try Steak44.   From the moment we walked in to the moment we reluctantly had to leave, our experience at Steak44 ranks among the absolute best either of us have ever enjoyed ANYWHERE.   The young ladies at reception were polite and friendly. We didn't think we needed a reservation in August on a Tuesday evening however we were mistaken. The place was packed around 8pm. She stated it would be about 30 minutes for a table, no problem. The atmosphere is exactly what we wanted; busy, beautiful, and finished in dark wood like you are in a well kept wine cellar. After we each got a cocktail, two seats opened up at the main bar. I let the young lady know we would be dining at the bar and she thanked me. Service was excellent (even at the bar) and after looking over the extensive menu, we both decided on the Caesar salad, loaded baked potato, sauteed spring mushrooms and the 16oz New York Strip, medium rare.  The salad was fresh and crisp, the bread was hot and wonderful. After clearing those items the entre' arrived in a sizzling hot plate with ample loaded potato and mushrooms on the side. As we dove into the perfectly cooked steak, smothered in mushrooms, it became abundantly clear to both of us that we had made the absolute best decision in selecting Steak44. It wasn't just good or even great, it was fantastic.   We have had many great meals, and many great steak dinners specifically, but none compare to the all-around perfection of this dining experience.  5 Stars is simply not enough. Bravo!",

This time, we came here on the second night of our trip after visiting the Mastro family's namesake restaurant (Steak 44 is a reboot for them), so we were able to compare.  Menus are very similar, but I think the seafood coverage is better at Mastro's. Here we had the Ahi poke, which was good, but not special. I've had fresh poke in Hawaii (can we say Foodland?), and again, this was good, but not standout. Fresh sashimi-grade ahi, with a spicy shoyu sauce.  A little heavy with the sauce, it didn't let the fish come through.  We moved on to the Cesar salad with egg.  Not bad, but again, I wouldn't say standout.  The egg was unique and added to the flavor.  Time for the steaks - NY Strip medium rare +, charred.  Center was perfect temp, but the edge was a bit overdone, more like medium plus. Somewhat forgivable since it's very difficult to get a consistent edge to center temp, but I just came from Mastro's City Hall and they did it perfectly on a Filet.  Dessert was the butter cake, which was OMG delicious.  Overall 4 stars for the temp miss, plus the just-ok openers.  Yes, I'm pretty stingy with 5 stars.",

    "text": "Steak 44? More like \"King Crab Legs (KCL) 44\"  * most delicious KCLs I've had in Arizona * but, ok...steak too! one of the best filet mignons * best martini \"heavy pour\" is how they do it   Add to those superlatives...the chill early evening ambiance of   the largely-windowed dining area with the fireplace - I'm dubbing that spot - \"Steak Solarium\" - and you have an exquisite sensory experience. Bring on the attentive service and you have an exceptionally wonderful evening.   \"22 oz Bone-In-Ribeye 44\" is what my husband would rename \"Steak 44.\" He was also starchly-satisfied with the mac-n-cheese and mashed potatoes. I didn't think much of the mashed but those aren't what I'm all about. I enjoyed the complimentary bread skillet.   I order my steak \"medium rare\".  I seldom order a side of KCLs - I'll only go as far as \"Oscar\" because I'm generally disappointed by seafood at steakhouses. Not only did I like these KCLs, I was captivated by them for a good ten minutes. Finally slicing into my steak, I had a fleeting concern that it was overdone. No, it was not as pink as I've come to expect for \"MR\" but it tasted far better than any steak I've had in recent memory in the Valley. Both the server and manager made it clear that if it was not satisfactory...to say the word. I was satisfied. They also gave me a tip I've never before needed in the past - \"order it 'rare plus'\" if I expect not to slice into it promptly.   \"Excellent,\" anytime, any way you slice it. I look forward to future visits to my \"Steak Solarium\" and to finally checking out HH in their equally stunning bar area, which is interesting because on a new restaurant, we like to do the happy hour first. The crowd is a pleasant mix: locals, visitors, businesspeople, couples, singles and it does not have that \"affected\" vibe that sometimes one can feel in a popular spot. It is, of course, your higher end price point, but quality, service and ambiance warrant it.",

I dont think I have ever been treated as well as I was at Steak 44.  We felt very important and the service was spot on.  We both had the filet and it was delicious!  Filets were served on a sizzling plate and were very tasty and did not need any sauce.  So tender and juicy.  I love the booths that were back by the kitchen where you could watch the chefs cook.  It was very cozy and sort of secluded but you could still see the kitchen.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return.  Great job Steak 44!",

The bar scene was vibrant, hip and filled with beautiful people. Every seat and table was filled, hot women everywhere, alcohol flowing, it was just amazing.   Now that the bar scene is covered let's talk about the perfect dinning experience. This was the perfect dinning experience, we were ushered to our table which turned out to be a private booth with glass enclosures. This allowed our party to talk without disturbing others.   Our server Nicole was amazing, all knowing of everything \"Steak 44\" from the history of the restaurant, to everything on the menu. I've visited many steakhouse restaurants and I have never had complete 5 Star service like I had at Steak 44.  I ordered the bone in rib-eye, bare with me this is the way I order my steak. Medium rare, blackened, very charred on the outside, and yes it was cooked exactly the way I asked to perfection.  Try the hassle-back potatoes they go great with a steak.   I so rarely give restaurants 5 stars, Steak 44 is one of those rare establishments that is much deserving of a 5 star rating.",

For sides we ordered the brussel sprouts, mac and cheese and corn creme brulee. All of the sides were excellent but the corn creme brulee was my favorite. For dessert the red velvet bread pudding was unique and delicious. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix.",

I regret not taking more photos but I was enjoying everything so much!  Great cocktail list and extensive scotch selection that I would consider for the varsity squad. Nothing jr about this scotch selection so bring your discerning taste.  If Oysters are your thing, do order from here. The variety is diverse and overall their seafood selection is super fresh! I can't wait to go back again to see what oysters they have next. Our waiter was fantastic in guiding us in our selection and his service was professional, genuine and attentive.  I had lobster and my husband had some special aged ribeye filet. It was the best steak I have ever had, cooked and seasoned to perfection! We had some nice potato side with the meal that was very flavorful but all my attention was on that steak and lobster. We also had a lobster add on to the steak with this perfect savory sauce that literally gave me a food orgasm! If you are a foodie you get what I'm saying here.  Every bite of everything is perfectly balanced to hit your palette perfectly.  I thought about that dinner for days. It's the type of meal that makes everything in life satisfying!   Then dessert, get their signature dish. Again, all the flavors work perfectly together. It's not too sweet it's perfectly balanced. I forget what it was called but it will catch your eye as you see it being brought out to practically every table.   This is the perfect place for a date, boys or girls night out or business meeting. It's a sophisticated place with modern decor and impeccable service and well trained staff. You absolutely need reservations, the more notice the better for the weekend! I cannot wait to dine here again. On par with a Michelin star restaurant!",

As the rolls were buttered and dusted with parsley and parmesan cheese they were bread sent from heaven. I followed that up with a caesar salad that curiously added a poached egg on top. Also delicious. Our table of six then split the creme brulee creamed corn (incredible and unique), chef Watson's potatoes (the best play on au gratin I've experienced), and hasselback potatoes. As if that wasn't good enough, the main course took my tastebuds on a first class trip to flavortown via the wagyu domestic filet. I have never had a steak more tender and flavorful that simply melts in your mouth than this god-sent piece of beef. All other steak is ruined. Ruth's Chris might as well make cheeseburgers. This meal quickly became the best of my life. Not one taste was wronged. We topped that off with dessert, the red velvet bread pudding and very chocolate cake. What a sweet (and spectacular) way to end such a great night. I can't recommend this place enough.   Bravo.",

My sister was visiting from Australia and my parent's anniversary was last week and mom's birthday is next week. My sister missed the anniversary and would miss the birthday so I decided to bring them here. It was my second time here and they were as good as the first time if not better.   We started off with a nice bottle of Piatelli\"Reserve\" Malbec, and the wine is just smooth, earthy and just great. My father orders a glass of Hennessy. The Hennessy was late, when I asked the server Sean he apologized, grabbed the drink quickly and took care of it. Such wonderful service.   For our appetizers we got the Crispy shrimp with sweet Thai chili peppers and garlic aioli and with it we got the roasted bet salad. This was plenty for the 4 of us we shared a bit of the salad and dug in that shrimp dish, with the garlic bread that comes to the table complementary and it was heaven on earth. The garlic aioli and sweet Thai pepper flavors were infused with that shrimp, it simply was amazing.   For dinner mom and dad ordered the 12 once Filet Mignon and sister order the salmon and I got the 12 once NY strip. Parents like the meat well cooked and butterflied, I got mine medium well and sister got her salmon medium. All came out perfectly, the meat were amazing and fish was melting in your month. On the side we ordered the roasted bacon and Brussels sprouts, Mac and cheese (which was heavenly and my mom loved it) and a side of hand cut fries. The best meal ever we've had at a restaurant in a while.   The staff surprised us with a small bowl of ice cream with a message that read happy anniversary for my parents and a small warm  vanilla Carmel cake with a message and a candle that read happy birthday for my mom. Coffee and espresso were delicious and the desserts were out of this world. And the beignets were so good and delicious they come with vanilla and chocolate sauces.   I feel unfair in my description of their food and unfair with my words towards the staff, just because I can not describe how great everything is and wonderful, warm and welcome everyone has been. Thanks Sean, our server, the buss staff that made sure our plates and cutlery were clean and everyone there. Keep up the great work.",

    "text": "I don't normally spend time writing reviews, but thinking about my experience with this place just made me want to write my first one - so here we go! This place was amazing. I came here with my SO for his birthday. I wanted to treat him to the best steakhouse the valley had to offer. After doing some research, it seemed like Steak 44 was pretty up there so I bit the bullet and made a reservation.  From entering the door to being seated, everything went pretty smooth. Loved the atmosphere, though being walked through the main room, people weren't joking that this place is LOUD. Fortunately, I think because it was my SO's birthday and that I made a reservation, we were seated in this backroom with about 8 tables which was significantly quieter than the main room! The bread was to die for and my server (wish I remembered his name) was ready and willing to answer any questions we had about the menu. He also went out of his way to make my SO's birthday a good one!  The steaks -- my god, they were out of this world. Something about how tender, juicy, and melt-in-your-mouth they were just blew me away. My SO was dying over the truffle peppercorn sauce, it's truly a must if you're getting a steak! The sides were delicious, definitely a lot more filling than I expected as we had to take some home. Then our server allowed my SO to pick out a dessert for his birthday treat which I thought was a nice touch (usually restaurants just default a birthday dessert). He picked out the beignet tree which was not only Instagram-worthy, but just delicious. As my SO described it, \"eating it healed his soul\" haha. The dessert came with two dipping sauces, and had a nice 'happy birthday' touch to it as well.  Now, something about Steak 44 reminds me a lot of Ruth Chris if you've ever been there, but my SO and I were PREACHING that Steak 44 is way, way better than Ruth Chris. This place is an absolute must visit for special occasions, great company, and delicious steaks!",

    "text": "Now that I feel better, I will review my dining experience at Steak 44...I made reservation for myself and my parents to celebrate their 30 yrs wedding anniversary a few days prior and received a reminder/confirmation call on the day of the reservation: which is great! Upon our arrival: valet parking, again, great! Parking was on the tough side as the establishment sits on a corner lot that obscures additional parking in the rear. Walked inside, the place was very busy, however, as expected on a Saturday night. We checked in for our reservation, waited about 10 minutes then were led to our table which was a few left and right turns throughout the establishment. We didnt mind, as we got to feast our eyes on the assortment of fresh seafood on ice behind a glass partition that separates the kitchen and the labyrinthine interior.   Our server showed up and entertained us with the chef's recommendations. We ordered wine. Wine arrived, 10-15 minutes later. We ordered food. Waited a good while for appetizers and eventually our main courses. I will break down this review in two portion moving forward: let's start with the food then end with the ambiance, specially the temperature of the dining room.  Appetizers: braised pork belly and king crab on avocado. Terrific! Very well done. Kudos to the chef!.   Main courses: 1. 12oz Wagyu steak: tender like you don't even believe; it didnt need a knife, a fork could have cut the steak! It was seasoned with salt and pepper, the best and simplest way to season steak. 2. 22oz ribeye: not exactly the best rib eye, I've ever had, to be frank, it would not have made the top 10. It was a tough cut. Yes , I know I just had Wagyu a minute ago, however I am no stranger to steak houses such as Donovan's, Charter House, Capital Grille, Flemming, Morton's...etc..., ribeye should not be as tough or fatty, may be the steak needed a trim? At any rate, I didnt care for it. 3. Sea bass topped with a crabcake and scallops on the side. Phenomenal! One thing though, presentation on all of their courses could use a facelift, the steaks came out solo on a hot plate, maybe a little bit of garnishment? Maybe they're trying to go with the bare bones, minimalistic presentation, however, in my opinion, first impression was definitely underwhelming. I'd say...1.5 out of 5.   Regarding ambiance, the establishment was packed! People talking, laughing, having a good time, which was great! We couldn't help but notice that upon the arrival of the appetizers, the room temperature unexpectedly rose...and the sentiment was shared collectively by other diners as well. A couple of larger parties left, I took off my jacket, all I had on was a button down. My dad started showing red in the face, my mother grimaced...I began to sweat heavily and had to go to the WC twice, my head was damp...it was uncomfortably warm in the dining room.  Our main courses arrived. We looked at each other and wonder whether we should have our dinner packed up to go. My parents persevered and started sampling their plates. Again, their fares were great! I didnt care much for mine, the tough/chewy and too-fatty ribeye. At any rate, I started feeling nauseous and ran to the WC. To my dismay, there was a line of 4-5 diners, of both sexes waiting for the WC.  I got into the men's room after a few minutes and started hurling uncontrollably. I supposed the combination of the fatty ribeye, and the oh-too-warm dining made me feel sick. My face and head were were wet, sweaty from the warm temperature. Upon my return to the table, my dad informed me he had requested the AC turned on. It felt amazing afterward! However, I felt under the weather so we quickly paid our tab and made our exit.   Parting thoughts, 1. The food, I'd give it 3 stars out of 5; 2. Service: 2 out of 5, could be much more attentive, we sat for a good 15 minutes before wine showed up, and even longer while food were prepared. Which makes absolutely no sense as there were a number of staff running around stepping on one another, very hectic! 3. Ambience: 1 out of 5 stars. Total: 2 out of 5 stars. Not impressed. I wish Donovan's was still around...",

It was the juiciest, warmest,best looking piece of meat I've ever seen! Cooked medium well and looked beautiful and temperature was on point. Savored every bite and cried a little when the last piece was gone! The sides are on another level too. We had whipped mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. Those two didn't stand a chance! Let me talk about the bread they bring out pre meal.....just keep the baskets coming and no one will get hurt!  Price wise....... be prepared to drop some dolla dolla bills on your meal, but it is worth every penny! This type of restaurant ain't your typical restaurant, the waitress asked us when we sat down if we wanted black or white linens before we ate.... say what?? All I wanted was a napkin! At the end of our meal they brought us moist white cotton towels scented with essential oils, and at that moment I knew I was out of my league!!  We enjoyed the whole experience and well worth the 40 hours of overtime I worked to cover this delightful meal!!",

    "text": "What can I say about Steak 44, there just isn't enough words to describe how incredible this place is. This is one of the top steak houses in the Phoenix area. Make reservations are you going to be waiting a long time and if you decide to walk in without reservations, it's worth the wait, trust me. It's hip, it's Arcadia and it's GOOD!  When you dine here the staff is tentative to your needs and they take care of you, they go that extra mile.   Some of my favorite starters is the bread (compliments of S44) - yeast rolls with garlic and butter, served hot, melts in your mouth.  Starters:  Super Colossal Shrimp Cocktail, they are $8 per shrimp but the shrimp are the size of baby lobsters. Cooked to perfection. Also, if you're in the seafood mood, get a dozen of the fresh oysters, 6 east coast & 6 west coast. I prefer the east coast oysters but the west is pretty damn good too.  Steaks:  Domestic Wagyu Filet, 8 ounces. I died, it's so good. Also, for that awesome marble steak, try the butchers cut, melts in your mouth. No need for steak sauce or horseradish, the steaks are perfection.  Sides: roasted brussel sprouts, broccoli and hands down, you have to try the Crispy Hasselback Potato, smoked sea salt, truffle butter and chive cream cheese sauce.   The wine selection is awesome. You just can't go wrong here, Steak 44 is the place to go. Perfect for date night, dinner meetings and if your in the bar area, great people watching.  I salute you Steak 44. Keep up the good work. I would give you 10 stars if I could.",

    "text": "We have been here twice, and being that we are big fan's of Mastro's City Hall, steak joints have pretty big shoes to fill.  Overall I was happy with pretty much everything here.  My boyfriend and I both love a good filet, and it was goooood.  However, on both visits the kitchen had a little trouble getting the temperature right, but on a big cut of meat that happens sometimes.  They did handle it promptly and got it right.    If you order the shrimp cocktail... beware...the shrimp are gigantic.  Two is probably too many for one person unless that is all you are eating.  The asparagus side was good, but the hash browns were a bit of disappointment, a little to heavy and greasy for my taste, based off the menu description I was expecting more of \"funeral potato\" type dish, but they are deep fried square logs with a chive dip on the side.  They tasted good but are are heavy and greasy. I wouldn't get them again     Service is very good.  We will go back. OHHH the rolls are to die for and the fried dough is amazing, don't pass on dessert here!",

    "text": "Top-Notch steakhouse in Phoenix. Steak 44 sticks out to me over the Mastros and Ruths Chris of the area. The restaurant is dark, yet cozy and romantic. The servers are polite, a little snobby, but attentive. The steak.... oh man... the steak has rewired my brain to crave it the way addicts crave their drug of choice.   If you want to impress on a first date, celebrate a special occasion, or you just want to have one of the best steaks you can get in the state ..... Steak 44 will deliver a classy and delicious dining experience. Besides their great bovine meat selections they have incredible Oysters and seafood as well. The fish actually tastes fresh, compared to other places in the Valley at the same price. Desserts are also very well done, and help end a very rich and savory meal.  Obviously Steak 44 is a high end establishment, but it is for good reason. It epitomizes the saying \"You get what you pay for\". If you have been brain-washed and only think Mastros is the place to go in the Valley for a fancy steak, you are sadly missing out on a steak and restaurant that will out do them from start t finish.  TIDBIT: The music is very unique... Each time I have gone, the music will vary from Frank Sinatra to Garth Brooks to The Fugees and Michael Jackson. It is not off-putting in the slightest, but something fun to notice. The waiter explained it to us that the extreme variation of artists and songs, is to keep the employees going crazy hearing the same songs day after day.",

The garlic butter yeast rolls were tender with it amazing garlic butter flavor. We ordered the petite filet and the ny strip along with the sauteed mushrooms and chef's.potatoes. Absolutely amazing!

    "text": "Man.  This is the best meat I've had since my experience last year in an Austin steakhouse (don't tell my husband).  ;)  We came here for a pharmaceutical industry talk.  Not only did we have what seemed like an endless infusion of the delicious cab sauv (perfectly smooth and a great pairing with the steak), we also were treated to spectacular meatballs (they're HUGE!), perfectly cooked calamari (not even a fishy taste or a chewy sensation), and a delicious caesar salad.  I had the New York Strip, medium, which was served on a sizzling plate.  I loved the fact that you can get your meat a little more undercooked than you normally do and then cut it up into pieces and finish searing it to perfection on top of your dinner plate.  The flavor was outstanding, and the outside was cooked perfectly to a crispy, juicy finish.  I also took a bite of the petite filet mignon, which was absolutely delicious.  They were both so good, I'm not even sure which one I would choose next time.  The mashed potatoes and spinach were great sides, but honestly the meat would have been fine without the sides in my mind.  We finished off a delicious meal with some sort of caramel cake topped with vanilla ice-cream.  They almost had to roll me out of the restaurant, we had so much food.  The setting is awesome as well.  We were in the back in a group room with a powerpoint projector, but we got to pass by some cool tables with candles and glass windows, and we also walked past an area where they had some fresh seafood laid out for examination.  It looks like a perfect place for a date, and I hear the seafood is excellent.  5 stars from me!",

My friend and I split 4 shrimp, the 16 oz bone in filet, and we ordered 3 sides: Brussel sprouts, mushrooms and asparagus. The Brussel sprouts and mushrooms were delicious- the asparagus left a little to be desired (they were small, kind of tasteless). The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. I will definitely return to Steak 44.",

For example, the prices are comparable to Mastro's.  But servers appear more personable and patient.  Not as snooty as Mastro's.  I mean, when they lead you thru the kitchen, that is hardly fancy.  It is more down to earth....with really expensive food.  I would rather avoid the chaos of the kitchen.  No valet parking as far as I could see.  Park yourself and walk in.  No need talking about the food.  If you're paying $50+ for a steak, it better be amazing.  If it's bad, you'll  hear/read about it.  Of note, order anything on the bone.  I truly think the bone gives more flavor to the meat.",

We have gone to Mastro's Ocean Club, Mastros City Hall, Capitol Grille, Fleming's, The Keg, Ocean Prime, Morton's and Ruth's Chris, and I can honestly say this is the BEST. We made our reservation on line, and the morning of our reservation they called us to confirm and to see if we were celebrating anything. When we got there Valet was complimentary, and as soon as we walked in it was like they were waiting for us. They walked us to the back by the kitchen, so we got to see all the amazing seafood on display. Our table was right next to the kitchen so we got a great show. Our servers who were awesome were Sarah and Jeremy who came and introduced themselves, as did Brett, and it was game on from there.The bread and Lobster avocado appetizer were awesome, and brought on time. We both ordered Filets, but I added the truffle lobster topping and a half order of crab legs....which by the way were HUGE. We had the garlic mashed potatoes, breaded asparagus and sweet potato casserole for sides. ALL OF IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE!!! We had a great glass of wine each and the butter cake and banana split desserts. WOW I can honestly say we found our new home... Steak 44 is the BEST",

    "text": "5 stars to me means you will go back and you will love your experience every time. I loved my meal here and would return as many times as possible.  The wait staff was so friendly and patient and timed everything professionally. We went to a meal with 8 people total and made a reservation for 5:30- 3 hours later we are leaving stuffed and happy!! I had the filet mignon and Brussels, whipped potatoes, snap peas, sweet potatoes and chopped salad. Everything was divine. The meat was cooked perfectly- I would recommend not getting a topping for the steak as the seasoning is so delish. The sweet potatoes taste like straight up desert with marshmallow ooey gooey on top! The Brussels were divine and came with crispy bacon. The mashbos and snap peas tasted as expected. The other important parts of a meal - BREAD and desert were both fabulous. They bring the bread out in mini cast irons- two flavors: sea salt and Parmesan. It's warm and you'll definitely try both. The desert menu looked amazing and while we didn't order any they still bring small cookies to go with the bill.  Some nice touches that make the price tag worth in include: hot towels after your meal, dark linens if you have dark pants on, a main waitress and a secondary, timing of apps / salads and food. You do not feel rushed  Price: Filet starts at $47, New York strip at $39. Sides run from $8-15. Wine bottles start at $27. For a couple to eAt with drinks I'd expect $200/meal with apps and desert.  Vibe: dark lighting, candles, decanters, brick ceilings, fancy. Definitely dressy / formal.  Negative point: the hosts were not friendly and put the party on edge. They were very curt about our entire party being there to seat which is understandable but delivery matters.   Overall I loved this place and will recommend to any friend or family who travels to Phoenix !",

Not only did they have unique dishes, a Tomahawk pork chop with not one but two chops, interesting sides which included delicious mushrooms, but also one of the best wine lists I've seen. The crowd is definitely upscale (note the Audi R8 and Rolls Royce parked out front, among other high end rides), but the bar area (where most people eat) has a great energy and was already hopping at 5:45! Whether in AZ for work or play, or you're lucky enough to live here, Steak 44 is a must experience.",

But I just have to say though the customer service was Terrible I felt like I was being treated as a slave in the Roman coliseum just downright awful , first they lost my reservation for two that was supposed to be adjacent to my friends table for a party of six at 5 o clock then proceeded to tell me I wouldn't be able to eat till nine. My friend spoke to another manager that said they would pull up a chair and squeeze us in the booths with our friends if we like which was fine so we did. As I walked outside for some fresh air I was astonished to see this other manger a guy with a  beard and cropped haircut who I had spoken to earlier and lost my reservation  walk directly up to me and my friend and proceed to tell me that he knows what we did and we went against his word and that if we hadn't ordered are food already he would've kicked us out and that we apparently \"disrespected him and HIS establishment\" I was completely blindsided I had to hold my tongue unlike the staff manager or whoever he is I do have manners to be quite frank this guy was awful just awful and I hope someone consults with this guy so he can learn how to do his job instead of pissing people off then you wouldn't get a one star review pal one word Incompetent Incompetent Incompetent!

Formally a Mastros, Steak 44 brings it home with a punch to your palates.  Their operations is quite impressive and the care and craft they have in the back kitchen; as Mr. O gave us a tour, was on spot to explain why this is a hot new dining experience.    Our tabled ordered a bunch of stuff starting with some truffle fries, cream corn, meatballs, and creamed spinach.  We all ordered our own steak, but I went with the bone-in filet.  My steak in general was perfectly cooked, nice charred on the outside and medium cooked in the middle that still steamed with every cut!  The plate is super heated thus keeping the steak warm all through your dinner.  The sides that came along with our meal was phenomenal!  Can't go wrong with truffle fries that came in a glass fries container shaped like a McDonalds case!  The cream corn was how it was supposed to be -- creamy and sweet!  Another highlight of the night was the meatballs - crusty on the outside, while you dip it in marinara and taking a bite release an aromatic burst of the herbs used.    Service was spot on.  I gather coming to a place like this you would expect that and it was met.  The ambiance was classy perfect for date.  Definitely, laid out like a steak house and one visited for at least one experience! - Enjoy!",

The steak, however, was AMAZING! I ordered the ribeye, medium (10/10) and thought it was great. I thought that the brussels sprouts (7/10), recommended by the waiter, were slightly undercooked. They also recommended the Dominick's potatoes (8/10), which I thought were good but not the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had.  I wouldn't return here, but did appreciate the quality of their ribeye.",

Very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  I judge all steakhouse experiences by their wedge and their wedge was on point.  So many great things on the menu its hard not to over order so be careful. They have some sides you don't see other places.  The corn creme brulee was great as well as the sweet potatoes. The bread pudding desert was tasty and the wine was delicious.  Only negative to the experience was the noise.  If you are wanting a quiet dinner this is not the place.  Luckily, my wife and I have been together long enough we don't have to talk.  We can enjoy each others company in silence.  Great place,  a must try.  Ask for Sarah,  she was very polite and attentive, in fact,  all the staff was.",

They seated us at a very cool booth with a full view of the kitchen, very \"chef's table,\" which we loved. Travis, our waiter, was so helpful answering our silly menu questions and wishing me a happy birthday so many times I lost count. The staff at Steak 44 helped to make me feel incredibly special on my birthday. Not to mention the amazing food. It was on par, if not above, every high end steakhouse experience we've had! Thank you Travis and Steak 44 for a memorable birthday dinner!!",

Had the Shetland Salmon with fresh asparagus and all I can say is that it was perfect!  It was the best salmon I've ever had. I'm still feeling blissfully happy after eating that.  The service was impeccable!  Everyone of the staff, and I do mean eveyine, was friendly, cheerful and just pleasant all around.  It was expensive, not something I can do regularly, but I do plan on returning for round two in a few months.",

My NY was perfect -- boldly seasoned, great outer crust and cooked medium rare. My wife wanted the sea bass but they were out -- not a problem our waiter put together a seafood combo of king crab and scallops that were very fresh and buttery. We shared the Watson potatoes that were on another level of complex flavors and cheesy goodness! Complimented with a nice bottle of Nickel and Nickel cab (great wine selection). We almost skipped out on dessert, which would have been a grave mistake. We shared the Ultimate Warm Vanilla Carmel Cake and no words can describe have rich and delicious this cake is, a must have!

Their happy hour menu is killer! Their Coppola Cabernet Sauvignon was bold and smooth. For appetizers we ordered a mix of east and west coast oysters, meatballs, steak and fries, and pork belly. Everything was to die for! The steak was cooked perfectly and was generously portioned for the price point. The oysters were large and the mignonette that was served added a great flavor. I did not try the meatballs but my friends said they were fabulous. The real stand out of the appetizers was the pork belly. It was perfectly tender and juicy and the sweet Thai chili and sauteed spinach was just perfect. It was so good I had to order another one.   Our server Alyssa was great as well. She provided excellent recommendations on wine and food. According to her, the second pork belly took too long because the first one was not up to Steak 44 standards and they redid it. Her and the managers were kind enough to take it off the check, which they did not have to do. We didn't even notice the time! That kind of service and attention to customer satisfaction sets restaurants like Steak 44 far above the rest. I can't wait to be back!",

I visited this place on a recent trip to Phoenix from NY.  To start we had a dozen oysters ( mix of west coast oysters) which were served with 4 sauces , all amazing.  For our meal I had the large NY strip steak.  This steak was cooked to perfection. My girlfriend decided to have the shrimp cocktail as a meal. This consisted of three colossal shrimp all very fresh. For sides we had the Brussel sprouts and lobster Mac n cheese.   All in all there is nothing to say bad about this place. The food is excellent. The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for an upscale evening while in the Phoenix area.",

Same owners as Dominic's steak house so I knew already I would be wowed by their service and their delicious dishes.  Greeted and seated within seconds of arriving.  Complimentary valet service for the car and treated like royalty from the start.  I seriously would love to try everything on the menu, but who can eat that much in one sitting.  We will have to go back of course.  The server was very nice and attentive to our needs.  Even the manager came to our table to ask if we wanted to be moved because of a loud group across from us.    The food:  Bread to start and some Miyagi oysters   Main Course:  18oz Bone-In Filet Mignon with Truffle Butter (Yaasss) Double baked Truffle Potatoe (wow) Roasted Brussels sprouts (yum)  Dungeness Crab Cocktail (so fresh)   Dessert: Beignet Tree (drooling)   Let's not forget the amazing Old Fashioned  cocktails too.

Each section has a different feel to it.  The bar area is a little loud so if your looking for a more intimate setting I wouldn't suggest it.   The menu is very simple which I liked. There are many different options depending on what you are in the mood for including steak, seafood, salads, and more than steak options. Ask for their dinner specials of the night that are not the menu!   I ordered their blue point oysters for an appetizer and they were the biggest oysters I have ever had! So amazing and fresh!   The first time I ate here I ordered a dinner special that included a petite filet with crab and asparagus on top with a lobster tail. Everything was perfectly cooked and extremely tasty. The second time I dined here I got the whole king crab cluster which was a pricy $65 but worth every penny.   The sides at Steak 44 are to die for! Don't pass on the corn creme brulee, it was exquisite. I would also recommend the roasted brussels sprouts and the lobster mashed potatoes.   Save room for dessert because they have quite the selection for your taste buds. I love red velvet so I had to try the red velvet bread pudding which didn't disappoint.   The service was great both times beside a few times our waiter disappeared for long amounts of time. The staff was very knowledgable about the menu items also great with suggestions. The manager came by to check on us which I appreciated. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.",

I often travel to Phoenix, I have been to all of the major steak houses from Shula's(good steak, so-so the rest) , Orange Sky(good food, super nice setting at the Talking stick casino), Maestro's Ocean Club(superb for warm weather dining and live music at the bar) , Maestros City Hall (ok), Dominicks(least favorite of the local steakhouses) and the usual chains(Mortons, Ruths, Eddie V's...) THIS has been the best food experience, perhaps on par with only BLT at the camelback inn, where I had a bone-in filet that was on par with the one I had at Steak 44.  Bread is a 4/5 (most think it's a 5) Regardless, I say don't fill yourself with bread when there are so many delicious dishes...  Ceasar salad is a 5/5 (poached egg on top-which can always be removed - I loved it)  Colossol Shrimp 5+/5 (don't bother with regular shrimp or king crab, they dont compare, imho)  Wife ordered the Sea Bass, she liked it 5/5  I ordered the Bone in Filet 5+/5 (I usually always order a regular filet mignon everywhere, but this is my second time ordering the bone-in filet here, and its superb (much tastier than regular mignon with barely any extra fat..)   Dessert: popcorn ice cream sunday with chocolate 4.5/5  Very good service, especially considering it was Valentines Day/Saturday  Nice bar area.  Restaurant can be a bit segmented due to the layout.  Open kitchen, always nice to see!  Will definetly repeat!  Highly recommended!",

Second course was an excellent beet salad and for dinner I had the bone in Ribeye MR. The steak was mouth watering delicious. Other highlights were a Scallops entree as well as the beef short rib. Highly recommend this joint, they have a variety of different dining areas and a nice bar where you can watch sports on the big tvs.",

Execution was flawless the night we were there, steak perfectly cooked, top notch quality, excellent service. The manager Kenny came by our table several times, which was a nice touch. We really felt like we were taken care of.",

From being told \"Happy Anniversary\" by the hostess, our waiter and the manager to taking recommendations on what to order. From the crab and avocado appetizer to the best filet I've ever tasted...Steak 44 has set the bar high!   We were even comped a dessert that was decorated for our anniversary.

Comparable to Mastros, Dominick's and the like around the valley. The Jumbo prawns were awesome and worth the $8 a piece. Atmosphere is nice and romantic as expected from a higher end steak place. Service and food is good so definitely a decent place to visit if you're into steak and seafood. I'd choose this place over all the other ones just for that fried banana split.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner recently as I just moved to the area from Las Vegas and wanted to find some really nice trendy upscale restaurants and steakhouses to frequent every week. Have gotten tired of not finding some good ones and driving to the ones I frequented all the way in Las Vegas. (Yes that's how much I love good food that I would travel to other cities just for dinner) I've gotten to know some people out here as friends and they recommended I check out Steak 44. I went on a weekend night so I understood it would be very busy. I only gave a 3 Star review for my first time since I'm hoping it was just a fluke with my visit and willing to go visit again during a slow weekday and another time during a busy night to see how service goes. The front hosts were very welcoming and friendly greeting me as I walked in. The bartender who took my order I noticed had notice me get my seat at the bar followed by another group but tended to them first. I patiently waited for a few minutes before someone eventually took my drink and offered the menu. I had noticed she sort of ignored the two gentlemen sitting next to me as well as we both mentioned it to each other. I ordered the crispy chicken entree but was a bit disappointed in it to be honest. The outside was crispy as to be expected but deep in the middle of it was dry. My side order of the Mac and cheese was the only item that I felt was good and the bread. That's another thing the bartender forgot too. She first forgot to even offer me any when I saw that she offered another couple sitting to my right. The first bartender I barely saw and when I did see she didn't check up on me on how my meal was, refill my drink. Nothing. It was another bartender that did stay on top of this. Little things like this does annoy me but I'm still willing to give them a few more visits to see how things go and just hope this is just a bad night even if it was my first visit.",

This did not take away from the experience. Outstanding night. They called me just now to follow up to see how the evening was and to thank us for being there for our occasion. That's rare for me.

The steak was cooked perfectly to order, the sides were just as a delicious. For dessert we ordered the ultimate warm vanilla cake for dessert. Wow. Amazing. I desperately wanted to try something from the raw bar, but I learned my eyes can be bigger then my belly. Maybe next time.

    "text": "First visit here for the hubby's birthday after we heard such great recommendations. We made a reservation on Opentable a few weeks in advance since it gets busy. I asked for a quiet, romantic table so they put us in a large inclosed booth where the view was the open kitchen/seafood selection. It was private and very romantic. It was an awesome table and the mood of the entire restaurant is dark and moody which is perfect for a romantic date. They also have complimentary valet out front so all you need to do is tip of course.   The service was excellent from everyone we encountered. The hostess, the server, and even the gentleman that filled our water were all super nice and very friendly. They have a great menu selection and huge drink menu. They were so kind and made my husband's birthday special by saying happy birthday right when we got there, gave him a personal hand written card, and a complimentary dessert of our choice.  They start you off with hot complimentary bread. Bread was just alright. For our food order we got:  - Crispy Shrimp appetizer was AMAZING! lightly fried and great flavor. Perfect amount of heat. - petite 8oz filet was delicious, buttery, and very tender.  - bone in 22oz ribeye was massive! Charcoal grill on the outside but super juicy in the middle. My husband added the burrata topping on steak. - Sides: corn creme brulee and whipped potatoes. The corn was INCREDIBLE! I couldn't stop eating it. Sweet cream of corn with the perfect toasted sugar on top. Yum! This is a must have!! - Dessert: warm Carmel cake which was delicious. The cake was super moist and paired with cinnamon pecans, ice cream, Carmel sauce, and whipped cream  Everything was cooked to perfection! We left feeling so full but so satisfied. It is pricey but great for a special occasion. The food is worth the price. We will definitely be back.   Highly recommend. Thank you!",

It's more modern and hip than your typical Mastro's, Morton's, Fleming's, etc. And both the food and service are on point!   My favorite dishes are the colossal jumbo shrimp, the tomato feta salad, and any of their perfectly prepared steaks, served on a sizzling 500 degree plate. They also offer 15-20 unique side options. And their complimentary garlic bread rolls are melt in your mouth delicious.   The phenomenal service makes the hefty price tag well worth it. I can't wait to try their new sister restaurant, Ocean 44!",

I couldn't finish it as I wanted to leave space for my entree, a 22 oz. bone-in rib eye.  The rib eye was terrific. I probably had 6 oz. leftover and could not waste it even though I was traveling. Thank goodness for hotel mini fridges as it made a wonderful late night snack!  We split three desserts. All were yummy.  Service was top notch. Very \"present\", but not intrusive. The waiter comp'd us a dessert as he said it was the house specialty and we had not ordered it. That was a very nice touch.  Definitely not an inexpensive place, but for the quality of service and food, it is a terrific special occasion place.",

The service was beyond amazing...our server, Sara - Top Shelf!!!  The food from start to finish, amazing.  The Crunchy Shrimp...pure crack Cocaine!!  I would eat a bowl of them if they'd let me.  We all went with the steak...I had the Small Bone-In 8oz Filet...delicious!  My boss and our guest shared the 40oz (not a typo) Bone-IN Tomahawk Wagu Ribeye.  Very pricey but wow did they nail that!  The Deserts, although we were already stuffed, we still made room for and glad we did!  I don't think I fell asleep until 2:30am but it was worth it.  Great food, great-great service and a nice treat for sure.  Whether you want to entertain a few business colleagues or just make time for a nice, romantic evening...you will NOT be disappointed here!!    Well Done!",

There were minor mistakes with food and dessert, someone's food didn't come out right so they had to wait for their new food and the s'mores dessert that was one of our favorites was out of stock that night. Since Scott was so attentive he found out right away about the mistaken food order and corrected immediately and updating us on the food status. He even saw how disappointed we were about the dessert so he let us try a sample of what they had left! Excellent food and amazing service. Scott needs a raise.",

I will say we order the fried devil eggs which was pretty good and probably the only great thing we had here. My husband ordered the NY strip medium well, it came well done. I got the filet order medium well and got rare. It seems like they might reverse smear the steak by baking it on the plate which makes the plate super hot and takes forever to cool down before you can actually eat. I guess I had a a lot of expectations walking to this place that were not met whatsoever. Sure it's nice in the inside the atmosphere is nice but the food is just not worth the money. A local franchise like the Keg offer much better food",

The first time my husband and I went to this restaurant we were celebrating our anniversary. The plate that had my steak on it was so hot that the oil was splattering off the plate and burning me! The waiter didn't mention anything to us about our anniversary and seemed really rushed every time he came to our table. We came back to work the next day telling our friends about our lackluster experience and they insisted we go back and give it another try. So here we were on Monday this week giving it another chance. I just got an exciting job offer so we felt like celebrating! This time we didn't make a reservation and sat in the bar. Honestly the steak and lobster tail was so tough and hard to cut. My husband who usually licks his plate clean left a good amount of lobster tail on his plate... that is saying something! My steak was a lot pinker then I had requested but I picked at it anyways. We both agreed that from here on out we will go to Mastro's when we are celebrating.",

Our reservations were for 8:30 and we were immediately seated by our hostesses.   Ambience: dimly lit, very romantic vibe. Would definitely come back for an intimate date or even a business dinner.  Our waiter, Darrell (sp*) was amazing! Very friendly and helpful. It can be very hard serving a large indecisive group but he was a complete angel and got each and everyone of us exactly what we were craving.   Food: I got the 22oz bone-in Ribeye steak with the creamy Mac and cheese and asparagus as my sides. We also ordered crispy shrimp and calamari & shrimp for our appetizers. But first...let's get into the bread. The bread was SOOOOO good. Buttery, garlic goodness. I want that bread served at my wedding, birth of my first child, and funeral. That good. Piping hot too. Our appetizers were smack ya mama good. You know how sometimes you order calamari and it feels like you're chewing on elastic rubber bands? Not the case with Steak 44. So delicious. BUT. MY. STEAK. Listen, I don't know what kind of sorcery they have going on in Steak 44 but my steak was so tender, flavorful, crispy, and perfectly fatty. Oh my god. It was so good.   Random but I really hate when waiters are like \"be careful because the plate is really hot.\" And you touch it and the plate is cold....like your food. Well Steak 44 are some honest ppl because they're plates are served at 500 degrees (of course I stuck my finger on it to see if I was being lied to and burned it) lol. So the food is sizzling hot when it's put in front of you.   The reason this place doesn't score perfectly was the sides. They just weren't as good as I expected based off the rest of my food. Don't get me wrong they were good but not worthy of recognition.",

We were seated in the back of the restaurant that felt like an enclosed patio.  It was chaotic with wait staff standing around our table and crowded with bar patrons hovering around the dining tables waiting for bar stools to open.  This is not an elegant high end dining experience where you feel good about dropping $300-400 on dinner for 3 without wine!!",

The restaurant opened at 5p.m., we arrived at 4:45pm and the line was already out the door. This is clearly a high end restaurant. While we were waiting at the bar area, they gave us glasses of water prior to seating instead of pressuring us to order alcohol drink. Aww...the little detail that makes customers happy. Well done Steak 44.   For appetizers, we ordered crab legs for 4. It was served in cold ice with hot radish dipping. Crab legs were already cracked open saving you time from making a mess. For main entree, I ordered their Prime Ribs. It has got to be one of the best prime ribs I've ever had. It was tender, well seasoned, tasty, generous in portion. It was cooked exactly to my liking. For dessert, we all shared the rich chocolate ice-cream, Gelato and the ice-cream desserts that my friend got. We ended the meal with rich coffee. The entire night was just simply perfect.  The bill wasn't cheap but was worth every penny. I will most definitely come back here again.",

The back did leave a little to be desired in terms of ambiance but the food definitely made up the difference.  I started with a pork belly appetizer. Scrumptious. Then had a ny strip, my favorite and the best steak I've had in Phoenix, hands down. As a side we shared the bacon. Yes bacon side in a container sticking up like French fries. Who does this? Nobody!! It's like no one else realizes how amazing that idea was. My wife still talks about this restaurant at least once a week and the bacon just as often. I will be back as soon as there is a special occasion justifying my return.",

We're on our honeymoon and decided to have one elaborate meal out, and we couldn't have made a better decision. The entire staff is amazing and so attentive, and our server Sara was a doll! She gave great recommendations and was so friendly and answered all of our menu questions. I started with the beet salad and then got the braised salmon (melt in your mouth!) and Brussels sprouts (minus the bacon) He chose the meatloaf and mac n cheese and crushed the garlic bread. We shared a bottle of Pinot Noir and came home happy and with leftovers. Overall, the night was amazing and a highlight of our trip out to Arizona. :)",

The blue cheese as a steak topper is a perfect combination for those blue cheese lovers. Mixing it in with the corn paired well too. The sauteed shrimp were good, but nothing to rave over. The butter sauce they were in is a great dipping my sauce for the bread.",

We started with the meat and cheese plate. Every cheese and meat was of high quality and flavorful. I ordered the Chilean sea bass with the creme brulee corn Asa a side. Every bite was AHHMazing.

Nice Ambience the place is very beautiful wine is served at the appropriate temperature even by the glass which is hard to find. The appetizers we ordered were very good one salad and the avocado crab was amazing.  Stakes are high quality and seasoned ok not the best steak I've ever had though. Sides we're not as good as the description made them sound. Overall a good experience but for the money there are better steak houses out there.",

A nice touch is the ability to order a smaller sized steak.   Been to all of the steak specialty spots and none compare to the evening we had tonight. Take Dominick's and make it a bit more casual...but with the same high quality food and service.  I wish I could buy stock in Steak 44...as it will be a huge success.  The meal and evening is worth whatever drive you have to make to get there. LOVED IT.  Can;t wait to return. Thanks Oliver! Larry",

Great flavor and the perfect size for a few people to snack on. We each had steaks and I must say the 22oz bone-in rib eye was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The corn creme brulee is a must, as are the roasted Brussel sprouts and the lobster mashed potatoes. Finally, the atmosphere was terrific. It seemed like a place where the staff will know your name and that is what will keep us going back. If you're lucky enough to get Alyssa as your waitress you will have a great meal with even better service.",

Server: Sara, she was helpful, attentive and personable!  The restaurant is upscale but not snobby.

    "text": "We made our reservations based on Yelp reviews, and we weren't disappointed.  To start, they have a terrific wine and cocktail selection -- but they had me at Wild Turkey!  It's a hoppin' place, but we were seated immediately (with reservations) and the staff started attending to us right away with a small skillet of hot rolls!  By the time we had a couple of drinks, our salads had arrived.  I had the wedge and my wife went with the beet.  Both were fine, as salads go.  For our main, I had the 16 oz New York and my wife had the Sea Bass.  The steak was prepared perfectly, but slightly under-flavored for my liking.  My wife loved her Sea Bass.  We shared a potato/cheese/hashbrown thingy (sorry, forgot what they called it) side and cream spinach.  Their side dishes are the bomb!  We are recent transplants from Dallas, so I would compare this place to Del Frisco's -- but perhaps not quite as upscale.  The Del Frisco's steaks have more flavor, but Steak 44 dominates with their sides.  We are anxious to return and try others -- along with a few more shots of Wild Turkey!",

And we wouldn't have ordered it unless our server suggested it. Overall another great experience and I'm sure this restaurant is going to do very well! I just wanted to thank the staff and especially our server Michael for making our night out an amazing one. We will be back for sure, and I highly recommend trying out steak 44 if you haven't yet!

    "text": "My husband and I waited and waited for Cork & Cleaver to re-open but were pleasantly surprised to hear that Steak 44 (of Mastro's fame) was opening there. We decided to go for my birthday last night. We were seated at a two-top table right at the corner between two rooms. Our server and the busboys were all very nice however it was very difficult for us to hear anything they were saying because of the noise level. Our server was describing some of the various items on the menu and I only heard bits and pieces of what he was saying. The entire evening, my husband and I had to keep repeating ourselves because the noise level was so extreme.    We ordered the fried calamari and shrimp as an appetizer because I like calamari and my husband likes shrimp. While there was a very ample portion of calamari, there were only 2 small shrimp in the order. My husband mentioned his disappointment to our server and he did send the manager over who apologized and comped the appetizer. That was very nice of him to do that. By the way, the calamari was delicious - cooked to perfection (not rubbery).  I had the filet mignon and my husband has the bone-in ribeye - both were cooked exactly the way we ordered them and were delicious. I also had the Dominick's potatoes and the brussels sprouts. The potatoes were good but not really special but the brussels sprouts were wonderful. We had the red velvet bread pudding for dessert. It was good but perhaps a little too sweet.  All in all, I thought the food and the service was great. I could not, however, give it 5 stars due to the noisiness of the restaurant - I left there with a headache. I would highly recommend the restaurant for its food and service, however, I would not recommend going there for a quiet or romantic dining experience.",

Our waitress was nice enough and knowledgable about the menu. I can't remember her name, but it was the brunette with fake eyelashes. Started out with the shrimp & avocado appetizer. Good, but nothing special. I order the scallop entree and a side of mushrooms. My boyfriend had the petite filet with sweet potatoes & asparagus fries. Everything except the potatoes was great! Boyfriend and I both tried to eat the potatoes but couldn't stomach them. Since we were so stuffed, we just split a raspberry sorbet as a light desert. It was good and was comped off for us, which I'm sure is their regular thing for birthdays there. All in all, it was an enjoyable meal.",

    "text": "Was a great special occasion dinner!  Service was very commendable, very attentive and our waitress explained the menu choices clearly, especially as one person in our party was vegetarian, so there were other options to choose from.  Nice decor, but also pretty noisy.  Sound levels were difficult to carry a conversation, should have asked to be seated in a quieter section, where the booths are.  There is also a separate dining room that was much quieter.   No private bottles of wine allowed, must use their wine list. Onto the food, which was very tasty!  Had the bone-in ribeye, deliciously seasoned in a blackened fashion.  The small cut was plenty big enough.  The house potatoes were very garlicky and cheesy, the sweet corn brulee, Brussel sprouts, mushrooms, all very tasty.  Would pass on the creamed spinach (5 Crowns and Gullivers in SoCal are better). Tossed house salad so-so, again Lawry's in L.A. does a better job. The meat is served on an extremely hot platter with the butter sizzling, very delectable.  In hindsight, should have ordered my meat a little more rare than their suggestion, as the meat is still cooking as it rest on the very hot platter.  It was still very tender and juicy though.  Desserts:  had the chocolate chip bread pudding, again very delicious and not overly sweet. Again, service was very good, they hand serve you all the sides onto your plate, and very prompt in refilling water goblets. All in all, a very good experience, well worth it.",

Steaming hot fresh bread is brought to the table in its own pan straight from the oven. While the calamari appetizer is a must, the steaks were not as impressive. The outer crust of the steak was over charred giving the whole steak a charcoal flavor. The steaks are served on 400 degree plates and the meal is followed up with a pleasant warm towelette. Overall, this is a highly romantic and fun experience with the steaks falling just short of perfection.",

They bring out these amazingly hot buttery garlic parmesan-y bread knots while you wait for your entree. The Caesar salad was legit the best and most authentic Caesar salad ever. We split the off-the-menu chocolate cake for dessert and it was enough chocolate to cure my week-long chocolate cake craving.   Steak 44, you've won a place in my heart and stomach.

The bar area is high energy and then you have the dining areas where it's a little more lax and chill. The Mastros brothers knew what they were doing with this place! Hands down the best fillet I have had and my family has never had a complaint either! Keep up the fabulous service and food and we'll see you soon!",

The tuna stack, meatballs and shishitos are what we start our night off with.  Love this dark wood and comfort you get when you walk in.

    "text": "IMuch like Sharon B. below, I went to Steak 44 to celebrate my birthday. We made a reservation (2 couples), it was on a Sunday. My boyfriend and I arrived early, so we sat at the table by the bar to have a drink while waiting for the rest of our party. I ordered Aviation (a popular gin drink) and was told they do not have all of the ingredients to prepare it, no big deal. I asked our waitress what brands of gin they had, (gin/vodka weren't listed in their cocktail menu) she replied with something like 'I don't know, I think we have Hendricks'. We were 2 ft away from the bar, can't turn around and ask (btw you should know this)...fine no biggy, I ordered vodka/soda. Got seated, ordered, served from the left and right (fine dining?), many distractions during dinner, interrupted our conversation to ask about food/clear table, clearing plates before we were done...  Time came for dessert, prior to coming I made sure there's a chocolate dessert on the menu. Ordered their much raved about chocolate cake and my friends ordered some caramel dessert. 5 or so minutes went by and our server returned to inform us they were out of chocolate cake. That was the frosting on the cake (or no cake), night ruined, I know 1st world problems...you know what? my birthday, my dessert choice! By this time it is 10 pm on a Sunday and no other place is open.  So here I am drinking my bitter espresso and a different waiter comes by to refill my friend's coffee, looks down at his dessert and says \"oh you should've ordered our chocolate cake, that thing is AMAZING!\" Well I would've love to order this mythical cake, but you guys are out and apparently your kitchen does a shit job at communicating wich items are 86'd.  No manager ever came by, not before or after, we paid our tab and left.  However, next day I felt like we could've went to a 100 different places in town, but we choose Steak 44 for it's superior food and service, food was good, service...well, if we went to Cheescake Factory down the street I'd understand. Steak 44 is fine dining and I do expect a bit more, \"we'll meet and exceed your expectations\"...not so much, this was more like mediocre dining, but with a fine dining price tag.  I called the next day (over 3 weeks ago), spoke to manager Jake, told him I didn't want anything for free, but I felt my dining experience was lackluster to say the least and explained why. He listened, didn't say much, said was going to check into it and call me back, I did think he'd follow up/care. He probably lost my number or is still investigating I'm sure.  2 stars as food was good, would've been 3 if I had the cake. For a $500 dinner, definitely not worth the hype.",

    "text": "I expect a certain level of service at a $$$+ restaurant and Steak 44 has unfortunately missed the mark on both of our visits.   I'll start with the pros; both times my filet was cooked perfectly at medium rare and was also delicious. The mac and cheese is awesome, and the red velvet bread pudding is seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had.   Now for the not so great experiences; we first went for my husband's birthday which I had noted when I made a reservation in advance. We were sat at an awful table, it was situated where there was overflow from the bar and my chair was constantly being bumped into during our meal. Our server didn't acknowledge that it was a birthday and also forgot to serve my husband his glass of wine during our entrees and ended up bringing it out after we finished. We thought maybe it was an off night so we gave it a second shot this past week. This time around I chose the filet again which was perfectly cooked, but my husband's NY strip was overcooked and tough. We ordered cocktails with our appetizers which then sat empty for quite awhile, we then ordered a bottle of wine to hopefully enjoy with our steaks and it didn't come until we were almost finished with them. I was really wanting to enjoy the wine throughout my whole entree, not towards the end.   While the filet and mac & cheese were delicious and the red velvet bread pudding was seriously to-die-for, I can't see myself running to back to experience such mediocre service at $150+ per person.",

Couple of cocktails - Moscow mule & Pinot noir for me. Our food was great! And when they say that the medium is a little raw in the center they mean it! But I'm okay with it so no complaints because the plate was so damn hot that all I had to do was cut a piece lay it back on the plate and it'll cook the piece to well done lol I'll have to say the only thing I didn't care for was the mac & cheese and mostly because the plate was so hot that it kind of cooked it more and it turned oily rather than stay creamy. The service was great and it was noticeable that it was a well oiled machine haha so good job to everyone! We were in & out within 40 minutes. Guess it helped that we knew what we were ordering before we got there.  Oh and just one thing that I'd like to see is the Bravo feature to tip the valet guys",

    "text": "I FINALLY made it to Steak 44 to celebrate my graduation from Grad School. A VERY fitting way to celebrate. Steak 44 is very contemporary upscale and modern with a very classic feel to it. I would feel just as comfortable enjoying a family dinner here as I would on a date, or out with a friend. It is really conducive to a memorable experience no matter with the occasion. The menu and selection of meats and cuts are reminiscent of a New York steakhouse, with enough non-meat dishes to appeal to any non-carnivores you may be with.  We started with a generous serving of lightly fried, calamari. There was PLENTY for 5 people, and the pieces were large, and the sauces delicious. No over-fried little squids here! Next, I head the Cesar Salad, which was fantastic, and served with a poached egg. I have not had a Caesar Salad with a poached egg since I ate at Pescatore in New Zealand, so this was a VERY welcome and pleasant touch.  I had the \"small\" filet mignon for my main, which was PLENTY. It was grilled a perfect medium rare (leaning more toward the rare side, which I LOVE), tender and flavorful. Sides are family-sized, so I partook in some asparagus, mashed potatoes, and loaded baked potato. Our server was polite and professional and extremely patience with some of my eccentric relatives.  Our evening was to celebrate a special occasion and I can think of no better place for us to have celebrated. Like I said, I can see myself bringing a date here, or maybe just stopping by for a yummy cocktail at the bar,  Will definitely be back next time I am in Phoenix.",

Both were cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. Without a doubt the best steak I have ever eaten! We chose Chef Watson's potatoes and the roasted Brussels sprouts as our sides and both were wonderful. The potatoes have just the right amount of cheese to accompany the potatoes and not overwhelm them. The atmosphere in the restaurant is cool and relaxed, but also feels special so it's perfect for whatever you're celebrating. Special shout out to our server Jenna for her dinner wine and dessert wine suggestions. If you haven't eaten here yet, you need to. I can't wait to enjoy my next dinner at Steak 44.",

Since they knew it was a special occasion, they sat us at one of the booths with the view into the kitchen. Our server was so friendly and attentive (not overly so) and the food came out really quickly. We ate the following: Parmesan rolls, crispy shrimp appetizer, bone-in filet mignon with truffle butter and a side of scallops, bone-in ribeye, corn creme brulee, Mac and cheese, and shisito peppers. Everything was delicious and the steaks were still sizzling when they got to our table, and cooked perfectly. They gave us a complimentary dessert to end our meal too! It is definitely on the pricey side, but reasonable for a steakhouse of that quality. Totally worth it! Can't wait to go back for another special occasion :)",

I just recently went for my bday celebrations last week and they have went above and beyond to accommodate my party of 15! Beautiful environment, fun decor and cool vibe with having several different rooms to sit and eat in. I prefer to eat in the kitchen area where you can see everything being made but my party was too big for the maximum 8. Their service there is impressive, the moment I sat down the server brought me over a personalized hand written bday card from the general manager and staff which I thought was a tasteful touch. All staff there were very friendly, helpful and made us feel at home.    Food is always delicious! I recommend anything on the menu, but if I had to break it down I would say  for appi's, Crispy shrimp and fried deviled eggs. The rib eye, filet Mignon for main course. I haven't tried any of the seafood but my friends rave about it! Side dishes I always love getting the smashed potatoes, creamed corn or roasted Brussel sprouts. Who can forget the yummy butter cake or beignets on a tree!  Overall, this place is one of my fav. Places to eat in phx and one of the top 3 places I recommend anyone from out of town has to try when they come to visit!",

Very polite, explained everything thoroughly, and and was very accommodating.   The food was outstanding! Their signature mashed potatoes, the sweet potatoes and the asparagus fries are amazing.   The lighting in there was also incredible.   At the end Dan came over to make sure everything was perfect, and sent out some desserts for us and our friend :)  The only thing I was not a fan of was the music. It ranged from reggae to old school, and something in between. Didn't seem to match the class of the restaurant in my opinion.   But over all a great experience with some great people, and I definitely hope to go back again sometime soon.",

The prices are a little high but that is what you expect when you go to a high-class steakhouse with excellent service. The ambience is great and usually there is an upscale crowd hanging out in the restaurant or the bar.

Staff is knowledgeable and pleasant, we have never once had a mistake with so much as a drink, and we've been here to dine a dozen times. My go-to is always the Petite Filet, medium rare, with sides of mushrooms, corn creme brulee, creamy Mac n cheese, and we always start with the pork belly, deviled eggs, and beet salad. Desserts are always pleasant, the beignet tree is a sight to see, and delicious!",

    "text": "Everything about this place says \"you're spending way too much money to be in a place where cows died for your pleasure, so stop thinking about your health, the environment, morality, or your future and just embrace hedonism.\"  I ate the steak nearly raw. I could nearly hear the cow mooing \"eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you die\" as I chewed its tender flesh and washed him down with a glass of wine the color of the blood that gushed from his arteries no more than a few days before. The meat here is very fresh.  The creamy spinach has an average median salary of over $100k, and drives the Ferrari out front. Rich and ostentatious, it doesn't bother squirreling away its money in trust funds for the kids - it's all up in your face about it.  The potatoes are there because white people from Paradise Valley get uncomfortable with too much color on their plates. They're there to remind them that Manifest Destiny is still alive and well.  The Caramel Cake dessert wrote a poem once:  Let not thy heart flag. Follow thy desire and thy good. Fulfill thy needs upon earth, after the command of thy heart, Until there come for thee that day of mourning.  You'll pass a wall of cleavers on the way out, a reminder that your pleasure mandates death. And as you burn the dinosaurs on the pavement of dead mountains in a car that in a little time is to be a stripped metal carcass in desert junkyard, think \"from ashes to ashes and dust to dust\" and take joy from the inevitability of death.",

Both steaks were so rare it looked like they weren't even cooked. They forget two things we ordered, and instead of the steak and egg gave a random raw piece of meat! Gross. The foods alright, I've had the broccoli and potatoes and I'd say it was good. But this is the second time they have completely undercooked a steak of mine, last time at the restaurant. I understand call in orders can be difficult, but for how much they charge, there really shouldn't be room for mess up, and they reviewed it with me before too! I was disappointed for my birthday pickup and wouldn't recommend picking up from Steak 44.",

We started with the beet salad, but I saw other yummy options.  Both of our entrees were divine- scallops and sea bass.  Yes this is a steak house but their seafood offerings are amazing.  Buttery Seabass, covered in garlicky breadcrumbs - brown crust outside, moist beautiful fish inside.  6 large scallops sauteed in butter and wine were cooked perfectly.  The only downer was the roasted Brussels sprouts - a tad too salty and over roasted.  Finished with sorbet - bright and flavorful.  I poured Prosecco over it to make frappe.  The service was amazing, you have many servers. Great valet parking too.",

Steak 44 steps up the game with amazing decor and a cozy intimate space throughout their differently set up rooms in the restaurant. Their sides are quite a bit smaller than the other Mastros locations but still hit the mark on taste. Definitely order the lobster mashed potatoes!",

Our seating was a cozy room adjacent to the kitchen, which is inviting until we realize there is a baby fussing at the adjacent table and now it kinda feels like an airplane...for 15 m or so. The service doesn't mention the steak toppers and we also forgot to ask. The Caeser Salad is overdressed & Steak 44 doesn't take advantage of using the runny egg yolk for dressing; crouton count is on one hand. My filet was nicely done but Beau felt the NY Strip was tough. We did manage to inquire about the donut trees spotted at another table. Not on the dessert menu, the waiter concedes they are a (top?) secret offering. A bit strange as the kitchen has the tree dishware lined up along the counter.  Overall, it kinda felt like a Sizzler evening...buy a decent steak at Safeway and grab a bottle of red.",

As with any great steakhouse the side dishes  are the standout, at least for me (mac and cheese, spinach, mushrooms, whipped mashed potatoes etc) . Their seafood actually impressed more than the (very good) steaks and I've had halibut, tuna and the seafood tower there, all above average in quality, taste and value.  Heavy  wine list and strong cocktails lead to boisterous crowds. Severs are well trained and uniformly friendly based on at least 5 visits there. I'd go here over most comparable places in town, and PHX/Scottsdale has many high end steak places.",

    "text": "Honey?  Can we talk?  Listen. I have to tell you something.  I'm pregnant.  With Steak 44's food baby.  Yes, I know I'm a vegetarian.  It's so wrong, it's right.  I've been side-eyeing this place since it and its greedy valet situation has pretty much rocked this entire corner. I do, however, appreciate the rotating display of ridiculous vehicles parked pretentiously out front and how they help me win the wintertime game of Luxury Car Bingo In The Desert. I'm shallow. It's okay.  My dad and I, feeling brave, actually put on non-denim pants and real shoes and ventured to Steak 44. We went early, sans reservation, fearing the crowds. We easily got seated in a big booth, ensconced by dividers, shielded from the abutting bustling kitchen by a glass wall so sparkling clean you could barely confirm its existence. No glass surface in my home has ever been or will be so spotless.   I started with the blood orange martini, probably the most I have ever paid for a single cocktail in my entire life. It was tasty in the way that Hawaiian Punch is tasty. I switched the to tart cherry martini, a wise move -- a complex and interesting drink with a heavy Luxardo cherry flavor. Meh or impressive, the martinis were big and accompanied by a hefty shaker filled with leftovers.  The hovering server, resplendent with some unidentifiable foreign accent, assured us the sides were enough to serve three to four. Because I was forgoing a pricey traditional entree, I picked a handful of veggie sides, while my dad opted for some medium rare 12 oz slab of moo. The roasted sweet potatoes and creamed spinach were okay, not knockouts, easily overshadowed by the glory of the creamed corn creme brulee. I mean, incredible, amazing, custardy corn goodness. Just divine. The thin, curly, crispy onion strings were fluffy wisps of awesome, spilling over on the fancy white tablecloth. The veggie servings are massive and will easily feed me all weekend. My dad, who was all ready to hate the place, because it's all trendy and replaced his beloved Cork & Cleaver,  was forced to admit his steak was a perfectly cooked, excellent quality piece of meat. Out of principle, we split the butter cake, which was bizarre but good -- like a pound cake and cornbread had a baby. Not the high point of the meal, but good.   The service was excellent and almost over the top until the credit card slip was signed; then he was MIA. That's lame. The place is not cheap; it's best reserved for a special occasion. It seems to be drawing a big crowd now, but is it sustainable given the number of pricey steakhouses in the valley?   Time will tell; if 44 stays, I can eat my fill of corn creme brulee whenever my whims see fit; if 44 goes, I get to park without circling the lot three times. All good; I win either way. Now, about that food baby -- it's due pretty soon.",

    "text": "I hesitate to write this review, because in all fairness my first visit to the restaurant was last night and perhaps we just had bad luck. I dined with my father and my boyfriend. My father has been to Steak 44 about 4-5 times now and it had been one of his favorite steak places to go to in the Valley. Which is saying something. We also consider ourselves \"steak snobs\" as we only buy and cook prime meats and if we are going to venture out to a restaurant for a steak it is going to be top quality prime as well. All three of us ordered the bone in ribeye which is our favorite cut. My boyfriend's and mine came out as we ordered, but they were very under-seasoned. I am not a salt person, my chef brother is always complaining that i don't put enough salt in my dishes. But I actually had to ADD salt to my steak. My father chewed and spit out nearly every bite of his steak stated that there was a huge amount of sinewy gristle in his. To us, this signifies that this cut of steak is a borderline choice (not prime) cut. Which to us is completely unacceptable. To serve a steak at this caliber restaurant, the cuts of meat have to be completely prime, they shouldn't 'borderline' anything. Needless to say, he was very disappointed.   Boyfriend and I shared the soft shell crab as an appetizer. Word to soft shell crab lovers: don't get this! I saw another review thought they were terrible as well and sent them back. We didn't feel quite that way, but the crabs were soggy and again, under-seasoned. My father had the crab and avocado stack and was less than impressed.   Our waiter was disinterested at best. He showed no emotion on his face, didn't ask how our steaks were cooked until half way through eating them, and just didn't seem too thrilled to be there (this is one of those things that we could have just been unlucky with. I've seen others rave about the service). But I've been to same caliber steak houses elsewhere where the server asks everyone to cut into their meat immediately after it's served to ensure the cooking temperature is just right. That didn't happen here.   The lobster mac and cheese was very grainy. Tasted like easy mac with some chunks of lobster. I've had better.  The pros: we had a quite table towards the kitchen which was nice! We could actually hear ourselves talk. I liked that. The dessert was interesting, we shared the Cookies and Cream popcorn, and it was pretty good! I like unique desserts. Finally, the BREAD!! I could have eaten that bread only for dinner and been perfectly happy. It was by far the best thing I ate all night.   It seems to us that they're starting to cut corners (cheaper cuts of meat, grainy mac and cheese, etc). And that is how restaurants in this city die. We have an extremely high turnover rate for restaurants and the patrons know when a costly place is starting to cut corners and they will go somewhere else. I don't know if I'll be going back to Steak 44 any time soon, but I know my father won't.",

Everything starting with being greeted by Frank the GM I haven't seen in almost 2 years, we were on a 15 min wait and he treated me like family and got us seated right away, we had a very nice chat, the recommendations for wine were high, seeing much of the old staff, the steaks are above the old high standard, everything was PERFECT, clean, it totally blew me away & every dime was well spent! We gave out server a 50% tip, the evening could not have been better in any way.   Thank you for such an amazing place, I will definitely be back!",

They accommodated every request and the general manager even came by the table. Our server was delightful. The bread was delicious to start the meal. We ordered a bottle of amarone - great value! Then onto the seafood tower - what a treat! Our steaks were all cooked perfectly. Be careful because they keep cooking on their steaming hot plates. The vanilla Carmel car dessert is a must. Don't pass it up. Try to sit in the bar for a convivial crowd.",

Something about eating seafood in the middle of the desert just doesn't sound appetizing to me. However, the king crab legs were amazing. They were very fresh and the portion size was great. Highly Recommend I was a bit disappointed with the portion sizes for some of their side dishes. Their bread was ok and drinks were very strong. I was celebrating an anniversary with my girlfriend and we were given the opportunity to receive a complimentary dessert. We chose the butter cake since it was something familiar to us and we both had an indifferent opinion about it. Our server and busser were great and the whole staff was very friendly. I would highly recommend Steak 44 if you are looking to try something new.",

Cooked to perfection- medium rare with crispy on the outside-just like we ordered. The plates  come extremely hot so as the steak is sizzling as it is set on the table. Delicious! However, that was it. The service was poor, the sides were mediocre. And the atmosphere was lackluster. If your in the mood for a juicy steak, this is a must try.",

    "text": "We have eaten at Steak 44 twice now and neither time has disappointed! We've had several things on the menu from the raw bar seafood tower, to the wedge salad, steaks, and deserts. We haven't had one thing that wasn't delicious. Particulary, the 22 oz ribeye is no question the best steak I've had. The sides of mushrooms, potatoes Dominick, and corn creme  brulee were all excellent. Lastly, the chocolate chip brioche bread pudding and vanilla cake are totally worth splurging for desert. I particularly love the bread pudding and even my in laws who aren't crazy about sweets couldn't resist the deserts.   In regards to the service and atmosphere, they are very good. The first time we went our server was Adam. He was excellent in describing everything on the menu, answering questions,  and truly treating us like VIPs. Tonight we had another server who was somewhat absent and didn't offer much in explanation (that is the main reason for a 4 star rating rather than a 5). However, Adam happened to be working and remembered us as he was serving another table and stopped to talk with us for a moment. He remembered everything about  our previous dining experience from the wine we order to the deserts. He noticed our wine glasses we getting low so he stopped to fill them (even though we weren't his table) and we mentioned that our server hadn't been around in awhile so he went on to fill all of our drinks and help serve our meals. For desert we ordered the bread pudding and received the vanilla cake as well. When we told them we didn't order the vanilla cake they told us it was from Adam. Adam honestly provided us the best service we have ever had, and did so twice. I strongly recommend that you ask for him when you go.   I also would recommend asking to be seating in the quieter dining area (behind the wall dividing the entrance and the on the way to the raw bar). Tonight we sat in the dining area by the bar and it was a little loud and crowded for what you think of for an expensive steak dinner.  Lastly, just a forewarning, be prepared to spend around $80-$100 per person if you get wine, appetizers, steaks, sides, and a desert. It is definitely worth it, I just don't want anyone to go and be shocked.",

We were seated in a semi-private, quiet dining room (only 4 tables) near the kitchen.  The wine list was nice and included some really good mid-price options.  Our server, Rebecca, was a True professional.  She was always there when we needed her but never hovering or annoying.  When I couldn't decide between seafood and steak she recommended ways to put things together so I could get a taste of both.  I had the crabcake and a small filet. My husband had the Wagyu ribeye.  For our side dish, the crab and shrimp mashed potatoes.  For dessert we tried the crunchy banana split.  Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared.  We were stuffed even after we took some home.  This place is well worth every penny.  We will be back very soon!",

When our friends arrived, the manager helped us to get a table and the yummy begins. We started with the burrata, oysters and , jumbo shrimp cocktail so good!!! For our dinner we had steak with the lobster and truffle topping and scallops and for sides we had brussel sprouts, lobster and rock shrimp MAC n cheese, mashed potatoes and corn crembrule can I tell you how delicious it was. Extra added touches that were above and beyond...when you order champagne, they give you chilled glasses!!!!! And they serve your sides to you on your plate.

    "text": "It was suggested by many friends to try Steak 44.  We had high expectations, based on their comments. They were mostly met.  Major disappointment was the service.  We were not pleased with the table they first brought us to, so they sat us in a back room which was completely empty.  We actually didn't mind that, but we were obviously an afterthought for the server.  She often sent different people over to help us and deliver our food, because she could not keep up.  We were obviously an extra table for her and out of her section.  The noise level was so high and we could barely hear her.  The steaks were excellent.  Perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  The creamed corn brulee was amazing.  The whipped potatoes were underwhelming.  They were not salted well, not whipped, were lumpy, and cold.  They took them off the bill and bought us dessert, so it was handled well.  Overall, a nice experience and I would defintely go back for the steak and the corn.  Was it better than Dominick's, Mastro's, Morton's, Fleming's, etc.?  Hard to say.  I think they are all equal with some hits and misses possible anywhere.",

    "text": "First, I think the rating should be four dollar signs, not three.  If you want quiet, elegant, calm, attentive service in your wait staff, you will not find it here.  Our waiter spoke as though he had had thee shots of espresso as well as a line of coke. We had no idea what he said it was so rote. Then,  we were bombarded by three men at once, one asking if we wanted black or white napkins (I assume to match our  outfits), another asking if we wanted water and there were three dif. kinds, and the third, our waiter, giving us three menus, one wine, one cocktails, one wine and food. These menus were big enough to sit on the floor and lean against the wall because there was no room on the table. Ok, a somewhat over energenic staff, and I think the reason is the  medium heighth man in a suit, standing in the doorway, watching over the room and talking into his wrist to his staff, was constantly giving them orders.  So my friend got the wrong drink...so simple, a vodka and tonic, cum, soda instead...three men jumped to correct his order after the man in the suit spoke into his wrist. In the meantime, a very tall man in a dark suit came to the doorway to oversee things. Honestly, the only word that came  to my mind was Mafia, really. The staff was laboring under several watchful eyes.  As to our dinners, the steaks, ok but not worth the high price...the crab avocado stack good but too much (soy?). The tempura  asperagus dense and oily, the 12 0z  NY Strip I could get at Fry's.....the desert...outstanding.  For me, going to dinner with friends is a sharing and intimate esperience in both conversation and food and should be a pleasurable and relaxing... like an extension of my own dining room, and it seemed that the costs on the menu implied this was the kind of experience one would get; but, that was not the case at all. It was as though Steak 44 aspired to be THAT kind of restaurant but falls really short.",

I ordered the lobster tails and they were very good, but the servers kept getting the plates mixed up when he brought out the salads and the main course. We were switching plates around each time. I also was expecting to get a happy birthday dessert because I noticed a few other people get the same thing, but all I got was a happy birthday. No birthday dessert. It's not a huge thing to get upset about, but when your birthday only comes once a year, you expect to get a nice dessert at a nice restaurant (or even get the dessert taken off the bill). I wanted to then the manager, but couldn't find him as we were leaving. Disappointed.   **Update: the manager got in contact with me and made things right. Thank you for personally going out of your way to do that!",

    "text": "Met with some friends for dinner last night to check this place out. Even for a Thursday night it was crowded and lively.   They did quite a job renovating the spot. Gorgeous inside. Also quite a bit Bigger than it looks.  Let's talk food.  Appetizers: shrimp. Spicy, crunch, delicious. The meatballs were tasty and better than expected. Fried calamari was pretty standard, nothing exciting. Also split a small ceaser salad which had a poached egg on top. Nice little touch.  Entree: I happened to be starving when we ordered so I went with the 22oz bone-in ribeye. It's came out cooked perfectly. They use some sort of house seasoning with garlic and cayenne I think. It really brought the steak to a better level. I am salt addict and I really didn't have to add anything to it. One of the better steaks I have had in a while.  Sides: the creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts were all pretty standard and yummy. The Mac and cheese was exceptional.  Desert: the only part of the meal that I was not impressed with. I shared the strawberry butter cake which is mandatory when visiting a Mastro's restaurant. They flavor was there but the cake was dry and overcooked. Not to say that it didn't disappear quickly but it was not the typical butter cake I have come to crave from Mastro's.  Overall, service was great, food was awesome, steak was epic, and I need to go to the gym. Welcome to Phoenix steak44.",

    "text": "My boyfriend told me he was taking me here for my birthday. I was so excited when I read the reviews and studied the menu. Also, impressed that the restaurant has a Master Butcher. This is how the experience went... We had a reservation, but still needed to wait. I'm not sure why we had to wait because when they seated us there were plenty of seats. The booths are really close together, so if you want a romantic place don't go here. I could hear everyone's conversation next to us. And, the bar area that you have to pass to get to the dining area is really noisy. Our server and his assistant greeted us. We ordered the Rhode Island Calamari & Shrimp appetizer, bone-in filet mignon, petite filet mignon and lobster tail. For our sides we ordered, Chef Watson's potatoes, Alaskan King Crab & Rock Shrimp Mac & Cheese, and broccoli. And, I ordered the Italian Blood Orange cocktail. The appetizer was good. And, we enjoyed the mac & cheese. I was surprised the potatoes I ordered were scalloped. The flavor wasn't that great. My $16 cocktail was just OK. Nothing special for the price. Unfortunately, the star of the dinner... the filet mignon was bland and chewy. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and said the exact same thing. Filet mignon should melt in your mouth! I guess, one positive is that the lobster tail I had was good. But, definitely disappointed with the steak. Oh, and here's the best part. The couple next to us was celebrating their anniversary. We both ordered the same dessert, ultimate warm vanilla caramel cake. The kitchen staff brought both out at the same time. Our server put a candle in their dessert and placed it in front of them. I was like, that's kind of strange. Then, I could see the kitchen server tell our server that it was the wrong table. The server tried to grab the dessert, but it was too late. The husband had blown out the candle. Then, the wife said, \"Happy Birthday?\" The server apologized to them and we all had a good laugh. They took our dessert to the back. I assumed they were fixing the \"Happy Anniversary\" message. About 10 minutes later, they came back with the exact same plate! It still said, \"Happy Anniversary\" and our server placed a candle in the whip cream. I thought that was the worst customer service. I mean, how difficult would it have been to take the cake ramekin off the plate, put it on a new plate and write, \"Happy Birthday?\" I expected a better experience. I've been to a lot of steakhouses including Mastro's, Mastro's Ocean Club, Stockyards, Fleming's, Arrowhead Grill, Durant's, etc. I know a good steak and this experience was disappointing. I gave it two stars because I liked how they gave us a warm towel infused with a few drops of lavender at the end of the meal, two mini chocolate chips with the check, and other than the fiasco with the dessert, overall the service was good. All of the reviews were highly favorable, but this night was terrible. Maybe it was a bad night, but I don't intend on coming back to find out if they can have a good night. They should change their name to \"44\" and remove \"Steak.\"",

    "text": "Best steak I've ever had. Recommend getting the prime rib, over the filet, for more flavor. I've had both, and they were the two best steaks ever. Lobster and cheese potatoes were great, too, as was the King Crab. Service was top notch, initial garlic cheese bread was legendary. Seriously though, I warn against going crazy on the bread. It's really good, like REAL good, you won't have room for the main course if you eat it all. I have had their desserts and they are good, but I've never had enough room in my stomach to give them a fair shake.  As expected, you will pay a lot here. But it is well worth the cost. The few meals I've had at Steak 44 are definitely among the best I've had. Great spot for a celebration or for taking someone on a date. You will want to make a reservation, obviously.  Something they could improve on is the table space. Every ime I've eaten here, it feels really squeezed for fitting everything on the table (bread, wine glass, water glass, silverware, plates, menu, candle). If you get a lot of things a la carte, get ready to juggle. The waiter we had even struggled a bit, like playing Tetris with dinnerware.  Go here. If nothing else, go for that bread...and steak, too. :p",

    "text": "Made reservations for birthday dinner for a Friday night. The restaurant was very busy.  First time to this restaurant since it was cork and cleaver. A few changes and updated decor for steak 44 compared to cork and cleaver. I liked the entrance where it had many of the cleaver menus from the previous restaurant hung on the wall.  The first noticeable thing as we sat down at a table was the loud talking from the restaurants where you could barely hear the other person sitting across the table. Almost to the point where it was becoming annoying that the people were so loud.  The fresh bread that started the meal was hot and fresh and delicious. Ordered the bone in ribeye, loaded baked potatoes and asparagus. The ribeye came out sizzling and stay that way for at least 10 minutes into the meal. The baked potato came with two potatoes in the order and was fully loaded like it said it would be. The ribeye was perfectly prepared juicy and tender. One of the better rib eye steaks that I've had in quite some time.  A few very nice touches in detail at the restaurant were that they used crumb blade to clean off the table many times and after the meal brought hot warm towels to clean your hands.  Since we were there celebrating my birthday they comped a dessert which we chose the red velvet bread pudding. This was exceptional and would recommend  this dessert.  Overall I would rank this restaurant in the new hot business category. Highly recommend this restaurant if you have not been there food service atmosphere and overall customer satisfaction is at it's highest.",

Unfortunately, my boyfriend couldn't decide where to eat for his birthday until last minute and Mastros only had a 9pm reservation... so we decided to try steak 44 and thank goodness we did. We ordered the crispy shrimp (I would get he smaller portion next time) and we're extremely impressed and super excited for what was to come. The shrimp tasted so fresh!! We then got lobster and shrimp mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, and steak. Everything was so fantastic and unique... I honestly don't know if I'll ever go back to Mastros after eating at steak 44. The only negative feedback I have is that the service was absolutely terrible. Very very forgetful and confused but the bus boy made up for it and was super quick to refill water, manage plates, etc.",

I have to say I was very impressed from the moment we walked in the door we were immediately seated at our table of 4 and the minute we sat down the excellent staff took care of us like we were family! There was never a half empty water glass or drink that wasn't being refilled . Every item we used from appetizer plate to extra silverware was removed and replaced with out a rush but at just the perfect time like a beautiful orchestra there was never a hiccup in the flow. As soon as we were seated they brought a skillet warm bread that was amazing . For our appetizer we had a King crab & avocado stack that I could have devoured on my own but decided to share. Next we had the Steak house Caesar salad with egg! My egg was poached to perfection so delicious and runny it was a great compliment to the Caesar salad that I'm never having a plain salad again . I ordered the 12oz bone in Filet Mignon my husband and friend had the 22oz Bone in Ribeye and my friend ordered the New Bedford Sea Scallops. All the dishes arrived on 500 degree plates and our steaks were sizzling with the aroma of Deliciousness you just can't describe but with have to experience yourself! My friend's scallops were very fresh and plump and juicy. We had 4 sides The loaded baked potato that came with butter cheese bacon chives and sour cream so you could pick and choose and I chose them all. Side 2 The creamed spinach , Side 3 the sauteed wild mushrooms and Side 4 the asparagus fries . All the side were amazing and fresh and devoured by us all . We ended dinner with a nice espresso and a gorgeous Fried banana split. I can't say enough about Steak 44 other than it was the most amazing night the food was over the top delicious and the staff is 5 Star plus . Thank you Steak 44 we will definitely be returning you have made us customers for life.",

She said they usually do not allow people to use laptops in the restaurant and she understood how this could ruin the experience. She extended an invitation to come back in and give them a chance to make it right. I have not had the chance to go back ,but definitely plan to give them another try.  Went back with a friend of mine for a special occasion dinner and it was fabulous. The service was just wonderful and filets were cooked to perfection as well as the sides we ordered. My only comment would be that it was really busy and would have like to be in a quieter corner or section. Really glad I got to go back and try this place again.",

This was our first visit, we went on a Sat night with a 5:30 reservation. ( at first wanted a later time which wasn't available 5 days out, but we r glad we came when we did). Our servers, and table staff were awesome! My water was never empty, our table was refreshed with silverware each time a plate came. Can't even describe the amazing food, everything was so FRESH, the steak was perfect! Food temperature was fresh out of the oven.   If you haven't been, you truly r missing out. By far the best restaurant experience we have ever had. We are already talking about going back soon!",

We thought this was better than maestros. The waiter and waiter assistant didn't seem bothered at all with our 2 kids, which some waiters can be annoyed with. So we appreciated that.

    "text": "To start, I knew exactly what I was getting myself into when I took my wife to Steak 44 for our anniversary last night. I knew the meal would be delicious (enough people rave about it). I also knew it'd be expensive, but we decided that this special occasion was worth the splurge.  To be quite honest, everything went great. The waiters/waitresses were kind and welcoming. The complimentary garlic bread was awesome. The guys serving water were on the ball the entire night - literally we'd take a sip and 2 seconds later someone was filling it back up. Our waitress explained the menu for our first time and gave great recommendations. She was patient with us. The ambiance was dim and romantic. A little loud, but no louder than any other restaurant.  My wife got the filet mignon Oscar Style and I got the bone-in ribeye. We also ordered Cesar salad, lobster Mac and Cheese and corn brulee to share. They brought out lobster mashed potatoes instead of Mac and cheese. I normally wouldn't have said anything, but I reluctantly told the waitress because the mac and cheese was literally the only thing on the menu she knew she wanted. The waitress apologized. Surprisingly, she told us to enjoy the mashed potatoes and that the mac and cheese would be right out. Whoa... awesome! No biggie right??  After dinner, the waitress brought out a dessert. The plate said \"Happy Anniversary\" on it. She said, \"We wanted to surprise you with this. I hope you enjoy it.\" Very cool of them! We did enjoy it.  The waitress gave us the bill and, turns out, she CHARGED US for the dessert ($8) and lobster mashed potatoes ($27). I figured it was a mistake, but I was too embarrassed to critique the waitress again, so we just paid for it. Today I received a call from Steak 44. They said they saw that they accidentally charged me for those items and that I'd see them refunded on my card soon. Very cool!!   I highly recommend Steak 44.",

It was pretty busy for a weeknight dinner.  We made reservations online earlier that day so we had no issues with being seated.  Between the three of us, we ordered 2 bottles of red wine.  I can't remember the name of it, Justin I think. We ordered 1 bottle of wine and blue cheese wedge salads, shrimp cocktail and oysters to start.  For dinner we all ordered the NY Strip Steak, ranging from Medium Rare and Medium Well.  No matter how they were cooked, they were all so delicious and cooked to perfection.  The sides are served family style so we shared Chef Watson's potatoes, roasted brussels sprouts and creamed spinach.  The Chef Watson's potatoes and roasted brussels took the prize.  We skipped dessert and opted for another bottle of wine instead.  We were all so happy and satisfied with our meals and promised each other another Steak 44 dinner soon!",

Very attentive, but the actual waitress...she didn't make suggestions as far as the wine, it seemed as though we bothered her with our questions. I looked around to observe other tables to see if it was us...?  No. Another server was explaining to the table across from us with a smile. When you're paying $60 a plate, at least fake a smile! If you don't like you're job, quit. Will go again, but I will pick the waitress. I felt I was cheated of a good plate for lack of recommendation.",

It's too bad that this place hasn't caught onto the fact that there are so many good craft beers available that blow stuffy old overpriced wine away in terms of flavor and it is what younger people prefer to drink.  Loved the shishito pepper side dish and would go back just for it.  Certainly attracts the older crowd. Odd strip mall location for a fine dining establishment.",

We ended up being sat right away in the bar area which was fine with us.  The service was great.  Our server was polite and attentive.  Drinks and food came out as expected.  The food was excellent!  Hubby had a steak and potatoes, I ordered a salad and a side.  Everything was very well prepared.   The crowd on the other hand was... interesting... a lot of older men wearing bedazzled jeans and button downs and a ton of cougars.  I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, or just happened to be this night.  But the people watching was on point.  Seems like a lot of the Scottsdale Quarter/Kierland regulars decided to take a trek down south to Arcadia to have a night out.   Nothing wrong with that- just something we noticed straight away.  Even had a group of men with what appeared to be their \"hired dates\" for the night.    Luckily the food at this place is enough to keep me coming back, but the whole thing was rather comical.",

Great location. Friendly and quick service. Very clean restaurant and bathroom.  Cons: Can't think of any. Even the prices were very reasonable for such high quality.

We asked to be seated within view of the game and we were well accommodated. This was a top-notch meal from the moment we entered the restaurant until the moment we pulled out of the parking lot. We had a variety of steaks, sides (lobster mac & cheese was amazing) and delicious warm rosemary rolls. The service was exactly what you'd expect from a top rated place and the food was even better. We were celebrating an engagement and a beautiful plate of dessert was brought out to the happy couple. I didn't think it was terribly pricey for what you get. I've paid more for lower quality. I would definitely return. The restaurant was recommended by my friend Kris who owns a restaurant in Illinois and knows the business. He was spot on. Can't wait to return",

The staff was extra friendly, very professional and knowledgeable on the menu and wine selections.  After ordering, like most restaurants, they bring out a dish of bread. I probably could've eaten all 4 of these little heaven sent buns to myself!  I ordered a filet mignon cooked to medium and served on a extra hot plate to keep the fresh off the grille taste. It was perfect! A side of Dominick's potatoes completed the order and they were amazing. Could not stop picking at them even after being full!  I'll definitely be coming back here again for another dinner.... And hopefully soon!",

The hostess (Danielle I think was her name) helped me in getting the flowers I brought ahead of time on the table, which was a great booth located near the glass kitchen so we could watch the magic happen. There was even a birthday card from the GM on the table as well, which was a nice touch. The food was outstanding! We both got the filet and both were cooked perfectly. Our waitress, Sarah, was so knowledgeable, friendly, and had a wonderful sense of humor. She did such an amazing job on making sure everything was perfect. She recommended the lobster mac as one of our sides and we were so happy she did! Delicious! Along with the amazing butter cake for dessert, they also brought out mini chocolate chip cookies made in house (with some extra for the road). I am pretty sure we closed out the restaurant that night! It's nice seeing a restaurant really go the extra mile and pay attention to the details. I cannot wait to go back and try one of the infamous seafood towers next!",

As you walk in, you are greeted by lovely hosts and hostesses. If you plan to eat in the dining room, I suggest a reservation, but we are bar people and were lucky enough to find two seats on a bustling Friday evening. The atmosphere in the bar is active and chic with beautiful lights above you and plush chairs at the bar.   The happy hour menu has several bites to share, but most of them are fried. I indulged in the shrimp cocktail which was served with three sauces, absolutely delicious. The shrimp was fresh and colossal. We also ordered the bread served in a pan. The bread had a Parmesan and garlicky taste, dipped in their homemade ranch was crazy good. My husband ordered the hassle back potatoes and a 12 oz steak and loved them both! The potatoes were crispy, but tender and were accompanied with an amazing chive butter/cream. The dessert was also amazing! It was a butter cream cake served hot with caramel and melted ice cream.   Lastly, the drinks are strong and crisp. You definitely get what you pay for.  I look forward to going back. This place is worth the money! Great atmosphere, good food and friendly service",

I would certainly try this place again since there were things they did very well but would stay away from the calamari and bread pudding.",

Anyways I'll post  my email here, in email form because I'm tired and I'm not editing it.  Steak44-  We had a decent night at your establishment as first time diners, but I would like to share a little feedback from our experience.   It was our anniversary and my husband surprised me with a reservation.  Our server was excellent as your management top notch, i just hate to complain around other diners, so i reserve my thoughts for email.   I wish there would have been some sort of soup appetizer, and maybe butter with those deliscious rolls! i imagine a lobster bisque or chowder would go great with your raw bar!  I understand it is more profitable to offer bottled soda but know some of us are really splurging for a night and it can feel a little like nickle and diming to a customer to have to pay for seltzer refills.   Our busser cleared our plates as i was still eating. I literally had food in my hand as he took my bread plate and then tried to take the left over rolls, i did not let him, but my plate with food was already gone.   This was kind of the main faux pas of the night. Unacceptable.   The wedge salad was crisp and creamy, but the abundance of blue cheese was really overwhelming. Its a little overboard and takes away from the other delightful flavors.  I had to return the 500 degree plate because im too spacy to not burn myself. Our server was excellent in accomadating this request and all requests of the night. I had to ask for steak sauce.  I prefer to be offered though, as to not feel annoying to my server. The steak and crab great, the asparagus needed the bottoms trimmed a little more,  very woody.  The people outside the kitchen were loud. We were seated in the back and could hear all the gossip and chatter among the staff.  We did have to send back the truffle fries twice and your manager was so kind to offer an extra desert, and though we were asked multiple times how our meal was, i just dont like sharing feedback in front of other diners as i think it is rude.  I also don't like to leave such a lengthy Yelp review but you left me no choice as it is impossible to contact you through email.  your establishment is truly beautiful and we would love to return for another special occasion!  Next time I'll try the corn creme brulee. A little dissapointed but an overall good night!",

    "text": "Steak 44 gets a well-deserved 5 star review. What really makes this restaurant stick out amongst the rest is their customer service. I was expecting great service since this is a pricey steakhouse but they really did impress me a lot. Let's start with the atmosphere. When I walked in, I wasn't really sure what to expect but it had a very warm and inviting ambiance. It was already pretty packed in the bar area when we arrived around 5:30PM for our reservation. We were able to get a seat passed the open kitchen (which is amazing by the way) and I feel as if we got a perfect table because it was not as loud as the from the restaurant close to the bar. Okay okay, I'll stop talking about all this secondary information and get straight to the food.   Appetizers:  Fried Deviled Eggs-crispy, perfectly fried. Sriracha aioli was amazing!  Crispy shrimp- pretty good, nothing too special  Calamari- once again, good but not great   I came with a party of 5 and we had the following for our entrees:   1. Bone-in ribeye- succulent, juicy, cooked beautifully  2. Salmon- literally the best salmon I've ever had. Melted in your mouth like butter  3. Crab cakes- fresh, huge lumps of crab meat.  4. Wagyu beef filet- best piece of steak I've ever put in my mouth. Barely even had to chew it since it was so freakin tender.  5. Bone-in filet mignon- didn't get to try it but it looked good and my dad really enjoyed it.   Sides:  Mac n cheese: good flavor, nice and cheesy, but the sauce was a bit grainy  Wild mushrooms- fantastic flavor and i loved how they kept it very simple.  Roasted sweet potatoes- perfectly cooked potatoes and I loved the marshmallow topping.   Last but not least, dessert:   1. Caramel cake-rich, buttery, with ice cream to cool it down. Unbelievable  2. Red velvet bread pudding- moist, flavorful, sweet, one of the best bread puddings I've ever had.   Finished off the night with a nice cup of coffee. Of course this place you are going to splurge but it's a great restaurant for a special occasion or when your just looking for a really dang good meal. This definitely isn't going to be a restaurant I go to often since it is pricey but I will absolutely keep them in mind when I really want to treat myself.",

Had a happy hour special : \"double old fashioned\" with 4 Rose's, and it was truly a double!  A great value @ $12.  Traditionally made with one giant square ice cube and very little extra sugar.  The bacon wedge salad was also a happy hour special that was decent at $15.  Blue cheese crumbles with blue cheese dressing and thick cut bacon cooked perfectly.  Now the 16 oz. New York strip!  28 day wet aged, which is not as common an aging process as dry aged.  The steak had a wonder full crust.  Ordered it medium rare plus.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  Steak was an inch and a half thick served on a sizzling hot plate with butter.  Great flavor and texture for the most part.  I did however have to order a truffle sauce to dip the steak in half way through because I found that the crust began to make the steak dry half way through due to the sizzling hot plate.  By the end, the steak was medium well.  Still good flavor but I've never ever had to order a sauce mid steak in order to enjoy finishing it.  That's the only reason I didnt give 5 stars.  Will certainly eat there on my next trip to Phoenix.",

    "text": "Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Totally! This was one of the best steak dinners I've had in a long time!   My husband and I went to Steak 44 for the first time to celebrate our anniversary. It was a Sunday night and the place was packed! Good thing we had a reservation because there was not an open table in the place and there were a bunch of people in the lobby.  We were seated in a section that was just off the bar. I would have preferred more of the \"dining room\" area but considering how busy it was it was fine. Our waitress was great - very attentive, gave good suggestions and overall very friendly.  We started with the crispy shrimp. OMG. I couldn't stop eating it. So delicious. They also brought out warm, garlicy rolls. Again, delish.   For our main course we went with the poke and split a filet. They were nice enough to split it ahead of time and they even cooked mine a little longer than his so we each got it done the way we like it. The poke was super fresh and flavorful and the steak was done to perfection. For a side we got the hasselback potatoes. Just like everything else, they were fantastic. As if all this wasn't enough, for dessert we got the s'mores in a jar. It was - you guessed it - awesome. Just the right size for a taste of something sweet without being huge.  From beginning to end, the meal was outstanding. The next day they even called to thank us for dining with them - a nice touch, I thought. I think we found our new go-to for special occasions!",

Having now been to Steak 44, all I can say is that we have a long way to go.   Ended a business trip wanting some delicious high protein dinners and asked the bellman at our hotel for a recommendation. He suggested this place and boy are we glad he did.   From the extremely tender and succulent Thai chili flavored pork belly, to the juicy New York Strip to the 2 rib eyes cooked to perfection at the table, everyone was pleased.   One of my guests is actually the pickiest man this side of the Mississippi and even he had 0 complaints! Both rib eyes were cooked beautifully with one prepared black and blue, not an easy feat.   Only thing that wasn't utter perfection was the poached eggs on the Caesar salads were overdone and closer to hard boiled. But the entrees and service overcame it.   One of the best features is that this isn't your momma's steakhouse. It's young, hip, has excellent music and a great crowd. It's also sectioned off to allow for more intimate settings.   Hoping Reno lands something like this in the near future!",

We were too close to the back door and there was waiter or busser station right behind us, so the guy had to constantly go behind us and would bump my bf chair. That really sucked. However, I would give this place another try in the future.",

    "text": "We chose this steakhouse due to it being #1 on Yelp's top 10 steakhouses in Phoenix.  10/10, would do again.  Did not disappoint.  Thanks to the waitstaff, they were very accommodating to us with our baby, and the level of service was excellent from drinks and bread service all the way until we left.  I don't remember the waiters name, but I would love to give him some kudos.  The bread was absolutely ridiculous.  Garlic and something topping, with a soft moist center.  We could have left after the bread and been satisfied.   We ordered the bone in ribeye with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The sides weren't overly memorable, but the asparagus was cooked perfectly, with just a slight crunch.  The steak, meanwhile, was phenomenal!  We ordered it medium, per the waiters suggestion.  It came out on a sizzling 500 degree plate.  It was slightly charred on the outside, which was expected, but contrary to my expectations, the charring left no bitter flavor, which helped make this one of the best steaks I have experienced.   Highly recommend Steak 44.",

    "text": "My husband and I were on a mission to find the best steakhouse in Scottsdale, and our search is over. I've never experienced better customer service at any restaurant in my life. It was my husband's birthday, and he got a personalized card from the restaurant, a call the day of our reservation to get his name, and a call the day after to say thank you for dining with them. Our waitress (I'm so sorry for not remembering her name) was so attentive, friendly, and warm. There was someone always making sure our water was full. And our different courses actually came out at appropriate times! We didn't get our appetizer and salads at the same time - our appetizer came out, then our salad when we were done, followed by our meal. Perfect timing.   And now I can start on the food. If you've heard rumors about Steak44 having the most incredible bread, you've heard correctly. It comes out, RIGHT out of the oven, personalized just for you. The asparagus fries were perfectly breaded. The salad was incredible. And our steaks had the most perfect sear and temperature, and they tasted like genuine umami steaks. Mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts were equally as wonderful.   Overall absolutely wonderful experience. I commend this restaurant for its incredible customer service, and it's definitely earned our loyalty after only one dinner.",

I can honestly say, this is the best steak I have ever eaten and steak will never taste the same again unless it comes from this restaurant. The service was first class, drinks never went empty, was ensured we were taken care of but not in a overly in your face kind of way, the staff was seriously on top of their sh*t. The meals came out on a 500 degree plate so my food was hot the entire meal, our table ordered multiple sides and they served out those sides to each person.. the experience was just absolutely wonderful. It was my fiance's birthday so I called in advance and scheduled a reservation. Upon arriving, multiple employees wished her a happy birthday without being told it was her birthday. The waitress handed her a car upon being seated and said happy birthday to her and that was for her on behalf of the restaurant. The manager had made a hand written birthday card thanking us for choosing to celebrate there for the occasion. This place was beyond incredible. We were all left speechless as it relates to how amazing the food was. Don't look at this as an expensive restaurant.. instead, view it as an experience you will remember forever. Thanks steak 44 for a memory we all will never forget!!!",

Service is 5 stars a long with the food... and if you like to drink, the BEST cocktails!  We were a party of 4, starting off with cocktails, Martini's, Lemon Drops and Cosmos all excellent. Appetizers were the Super Colossal Shrimp Cocktail and the Chef's \"PB&J\" (pate, Bourbon and Fig Jam). Entree's were the Small NY Strips and the Bone-in Veal Chop with the sides of Chef Watson's Potatoes and Crinkle Cut Fries. All the dishes were prepared to request and tasted fantastic!

Service is top notch from the moment you pull up to their complimentary valet parking.  You're going to spend a lot, but their attention to detail is well worth the price.  You're not coming here for a good deal, but a great steak served to you by a well orchestrated staff to provide a standout dining experience.  One thing to note is that the steaks are served on a plate heated to 500 degrees.  I ordered my steak medium rare and the last 1/3rd of my rib-eye was medium by the time I got to it.  Not a deal breaker, but be aware if you're very picky about having a rare steak as it will continue to cook slightly at the table.",

Also, a martini that costs $18 is ridiculous especially when made with well vodka. Come on guys - I don't mind overpaying for a good steak but $16 for scallop potatoes?  Not cool.",

There was basically no wait time from the moment we arrived. All staff members were incredibly attentive and made our experience there very welcoming and fun!   I enjoyed the ginger peach cocktail and my husband enjoyed his tequilas. They have complimentary bread and OMG, it was buttery, soft and warm deliciousness in your mouth.  Try your best to not fill up on it. We started out with the crispy shrimp as most had mentioned in their reviews and we really enjoyed it as well. It had the perfect crisp, heat and tons of flavor. Highly recommend. We split the chopped salad and that was good.  My husband ordered the bone in filet and that was magnificent. Very, very good. I ordered the Chilean sea bass and had it crispy on the outside. It was slightly, slightly over cooked but it was very enjoyable. I would probably order steak next time, well duh, it's a steak house and they really know their steak.  We accompanied our entree with some wild mushrooms and bacon Brussels sprouts. Both excellent sides.  Both of us were pretty stuffed from our meal but Steal 44 kindly offered us a free dessert and we couldn't say no. We had the ultimate warm vanilla caramel cake with a huge side of butter cream and it was amazingly good. We finished the meal with some coffee and latte and I'm not a coffee person but I had to say their latte was very light and smooth. Overall it was an amazing experience and will highly recommend others to try this place out. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the slightly over cooked fish.",

    "text": "Last night we got the pleasure of dining at Steak 44 in Phoenix AZ, to celebrate my daughters birthday!  We have been to all the top steak houses around the US States, and this one ranks at the top of our list! Let's start with our waiter, Nicholas Stevenson... what a BOSS! he really was the foundation of our perfect night, giving us great suggestions, his calm demeanor, and friendliness and insight on the food, from where the meat is raised and from what states, to every other question we had regarding the menu. Didn't skip a beat, he was attentive in a way, that kept us wanting him around! Wine glasses kept full in perfect unison, nothing went unnoticed, and all our dinning needs were met above our expectations In fact we will definitely request him on our next visit!  The quality of the steaks compares to no other. Served on 500 degree plates, the sizzle continues throughout your entire meal! The appetizers are absolutely amazing, we ordered the pork belly, and prawn cocktail. The pork belly, literally melts in your mouth, with a great balance of Thai Chile sauce and wilted spinach to cut the delicious fatness of this delicate dish. The seafood was fresh, tender, and was accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemon sauce, and fresh horseradish. DELICIOUS!  As for our meat choices, our party ordered 2 8oz petit filets, a 12 oz filet and a 20oz Bone In Rib Eye! All came out a little under of what we ordered, as recommended, because the 500 degree will continue to cook your steak as you eat!  Viola! It's like magic, PERFECTION! Our meat was cooked to order during our meal!  Our side dishes did not disappoint as well, the sweet corn, Brussel sprouts, and whipped potatoes, were the perfect accompaniment to our steaks! The problem is choosing which sides, be prepared to drool over a huge selection of side dishes! Actually good luck on choosing any item on the menu that doesn't leave you perplexed on what to order, because EVERY ITEMS Description leaves your mouth watering. I'm sure it's safe to say, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  We finished our meal with s'mores in a jar, and the special offering that evening of beignets with Nutella and vanilla dipping sauce! So delicious! Local Cave Creek coffee was served, amazing! A perfect nights celebration with amazing food, and service from all attendants, the staff here is everything and more you would expect at a high end steak house!   Happy Hour!! An incredible deal, quality food, and a fun time at the bar! Steak 44 style! No better way! Connor is a fun and great bar tender, he made it feel just as special as sitting in the dining room.",

She has a great rapport with not just me, but all of her customers, whether it's their first time their 44th time! Be sure to get to the bar early, as seats go fast! (Bar opens at 4:00PM daily)   Let's move on to the food!  Amazing! Steak 44 is hands down the best steak in town! Steak 44 only serves the highest quality beef in the industry, in fact their entire menu is the highest quality in the industry. On more than once occasion, something I have wanted to order wasn't available because \"the quality wasn't up to our standards today\". Wow! What other restaurant would do that!?    Steak 44 is not just amazing steaks, their seafood is also the best in the business. I have had fantastic fish, crab, oysters and my favorite, the life changing shrimp cocktail!   If Steak 44 has been in your radar, you must go! I promise you won't be disappointed. Be sure to stop by for a cocktail from Amanda before dinner!

The attentive server noticed a tiny chip on my grand daughter's water glass and replaced it promptly (... we had to squint to see it). The manager, Brett Trusow came to the table after we finished to make sure everything was perfect. He also treated my husband to a fabulous, free dessert when he learned that his birthday was coming up soon.   Bottom line: If you want to impress a date, colleague, or boss, this is the place to take them",

Complementary valet parking out front is a good idea as there isn't much in the strip center it is connected to.  Great decor when you walk in. High-end as expected but all the staff was very friendly and not stuffy. Our group of three ordered drinks and wine from their decently large wine selection and then skipped the starters and went right to salads. We agreed the Wedge was the best (as our server mentioned).   Mains of wet-aged steaks (bone-on and filet) were amazing - ask for a little warmer than normal (medium-well came out like Medium for both of us). The fish was good but not great; it is a steakhouse - go with a steak...  We skipped desert, but little cookies came to the table anyway. I will certainly return in",

    "text": "The consensus among our close friends and family is that Steak 44 serves not just the best steaks in Phoenix, but the best steaks anywhere.  My husband and I like having dinner at Steak 44 for special occasions, group dinners, and whenever we have out-of-town guests who enjoy steak.  While all the steaks we have tried there--the filet mignon, the bone-in filet mignon, the bone-in ribeye, the Tomahawk ribeye--are delicious, our absolute favorite item on the menu is the bone-in filet mignon.  It's incredible how much more flavorful the bone-in filet is than the boneless filet.  The steaks we have ordered are always perfectly seasoned and cooked (we prefer our steaks cooked medium rare).  While everything else on the menu is certainly good, the five-star rating is mainly attributed to the exceptional steaks and service.  The wine and cocktail selections are great.  And while I always have to resist filling up on the fresh, warm bread that is served before every meal, I still kind of miss the popovers from BLT Steak, which closed its AZ location.  We enjoy starting off with two to three oysters per person as an appetizer--we prefer west coast oysters, especially Kumamotos.  Additionally, I find the roasted beet salad to be refreshing and nice to share.  The sides are good, but no side is so spectacular that it would cause me to rave about it like their bone-in filet mignon.  If you have room for dessert, order the beignets, which are served as a \"beignet tree\" with sides of chocolate and vanilla cream dipping sauces.  While not as amazing as the beignets you would find in New Orleans, I rarely ever dine at Steak 44 without ordering this dessert item.  Like their steaks, the service at Steak 44 is also incredible.  The servers are attentive, polite, and knowledgeable.  Robbie Weiz, one of the managers, is awesome and always makes sure that customers are having the best dining experience possible.      The restaurant is clean and dimly lit.  It also has separate dining rooms to accommodate your needs.  When we dine with my grandmother at Steak 44, we make sure to ask for a table in one of the quieter rooms because she can't tolerate a lot of noise.  We enjoy eating on the patio or in the room shared with the bar with our friends, and we enjoy an intimate table in the main dining room when my husband and I go by ourselves.  My only minor complaint is that there are two areas in the restaurant in which we've dined where the ambiance was disrupted by the constant rattling of a window or glass--(1) we sat at a table in the back dining room (not sure what this dining area is called, but you walk past the kitchen and enter the area through a door) next to a window that rattled whenever anyone (mainly servers) entered or exited the dining area through the door (seats at other tables in this room were fine); and (2) we sat at a table in a cozy dining room adjacent to the kitchen and separated by glass, but the glass would rattle whenever servers put back their serving tray stands, which also caused a loud noise from the tray stands hitting each other.  But, since the service is so good, Steak 44 will make sure to move you to a different table if there is an issue.  It's a popular venue and always appears packed.  So, if possible, make reservations at least a week prior and, obviously, even more in advance if you anticipate having a large group.  We've never tried going without a reservation so I don't know what the wait is like without one, but we are seated either immediately or within minutes when we arrive with reservations.   The bottom line is that Steak 44 is among our favorite restaurants and has the best steaks and service!  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!",

    "text": "Amazing Experience!! Everything about this place is 1ST CLASS.  I don't write a lot of reviews but this experience was review worthy. My husband and I moved to Phoenix last year from Dallas TX. Being from Dallas there is not a shortage of great fine dining steakhouses and I would guess that we've eaten at 90% of them.  We had heard that Steak 44 was started by the original owners of Maestros (now owned by Laundrys) and current owners of Dominick's so based on experience we felt confident we were in good hands for a fabulous meal.  Even with that little nugget of information and confidence we still were pleasantly surprised by how wonderful everything was.  Hands down the food was some of the best quality I have ever eaten. The freshness, flavor, and presentation was an A+  On top of that the quality of service we received was some of the best I can remember. From the valet, hostess, waiter, management, and everyone in between we were highly impressed.  Our waiters name was Taylor Castleberry and he was fantastic. He was friendly, knowledgable, and provided some of the best service we've ever received.  The assistant Matthew Collins was also very impressive. He too was friendly and knowledgable. He went out of his way to help us with a to go order to be able to take more stuff home even though he was visibly busy. He has a great attitude and the two of them seem to work great together and have a positive energy which provides your guest with an instant level of comfort.  This was Saturday April 29th and I believe the manager on duty was named Seth. He too came by our table twice to make sure we were satisfied. He was polite and professional.  We will continue to dine at Steak 44 and I would encourage anyone I know to check it out.  We LOVED it!  Thank you Steak 44 for making our anniversary dinner special. Oh and for the complimentary dessert :)   The Johnsons",

If you are looking for a white table cloth kind of dinner, this is the spot. I chose a Caesar salad with a soft boiled egg, filet with a side of sweet potatoes. The only complaint we had was the bus boy spilled water on my friends lap, the server dropped some noodles on the table, and the steaks were not all cooked exactly to order (some were a little over/under cooked.) But despite some human error this place still deserves 5 stars from their desserts alone. I was impressed with about 10 different choices. It was the hardest decision of the night with all the great options. I think it was impossible to make a wrong choice bc everyone at our table loved each bite.",

Don't go just for the food, go for the attention to detail that makes 'eating out' completely different from 'dining out'. The bar was mobbed and looked fun. But we wanted a quieter dinner to celebrate and we were seated in a small space with only 2 other tables. That was totally our speed. My advice is to talk to them when you make your reservations and seek out the vibe you want. In the bar is lively and loud, in some of the other spaces, quieter. Some better for romance and some better for business clients.",

    "text": "Celebrated my Mother-in-law's birthday here last night and give Steak 44 the following break down: Oysters: 5 stars...mmmm...delish! Caesar salad: 1 star...wilted lettuce, lukewarm, lacked flavor.  Expected much better. Steak: 20 stars...so so so so amazingly delicious.  2 of us has petite filets, one had the Waygu special.  Huge steak ($110!!!). Lots of leftovers. Sides:  4 stars.  Potatoes Dominic were good, but better the 2nd day.  Brussel sprouts amazing!!  Onion straws and baked potatoes...good. Dessert: 5 stars...strawberry butter cake.  Wow.  That's all. Drinks: 2 cocktails were perfect.  Wine selection nice.  The recommendation made by our waitress was just perfect. Decor: 5 stars  Ambiance: 3 stars...music throughout was pop music.  Should have had something that matched the decor and \"steakhouse\" feel.  Made it extra noisy. Service:  4 stars. Good, what you would expect.  One in our group felt it could have been better given the price tag.  We would have liked to know the cost of the specials when the waitress gave us the rundown.  Were surprised with the $110 cost of the Waygu steak.  It was worth it though! We received the dessert free for a birthday treat.    We really wanted to try it for a special occasion.  Had fun and awesome steak, but probably won't go back given other steakhouse and high end options in the valley we've liked better.",

My husband really enjoyed this experience watching how the dishes were prepared. The manager came by which was nice to ask how we were enjoying our dinner and we told him that we been to other high end establishments but this was the best one that succeed them all.

    "text": "To start with, the positives.   GREAT steak.   Have no complaints, and done just as I asked for.    Side dishes were excellent.   A nice pour of whiskey for my drink.    My companion was quite pleased as well as it pertains to the food quality.     Negatives - I think the seating is a bit close for \"fine dining,\" and the wait staff isn't too interested in you unless you're ordering the most expensive stuff on the menu.     My dinner companion and I were not all THAT hungry, and so we only spent $200.   Apparently that wasn't impressive enough for our waiter, who didn't even thank us when he picked up the signed slip and generous cash tip.    For as good as the food is, I do think it's a bit pricey there, and I'd rather spend $200 at Durant's for a little quieter atmosphere, more polite/less stuck-up service, and an all around better experience.    Which is what I'll do; despite the quality of the food, it's not better than Durant's, the service is snobbish, and the atmosphere is far too noisy.   I guess if we'd spent $500 by ordering the obscenely priced $195 entree we would have had more polite service.",

    "text": "Last night we went to Steak 44; it was my first time. The atmosphere is a little loud but the tables are round so you don't have to yell across to one another...you just intimately lean in to talk.  We ended up staying in the lounge area to eat.  I like to people watch and it certainly makes for a better time than a booth in a dining room.  I am still unsure who we saw at the table next to us but our bets are on, baseball player, BMX rider (that was Rich), or Rapper.  I didn't have enough alcohol to ask before he left.  We started off with a chef's choice seafood tower.  Sans oysters, we have  been out before and determined that we aren't so cool that we like the slurpy sounds that go along with a well shucked oyster.  We were amazed at the amount of seafood that we ended up with.  It is slightly misleading because it is more of \"tower\" on its side but a standing tower would require some scaffolding.  I was too full to eat steak and would have settled on just the company but I was peer pressured into a slab of beef.  Much like other first time pressure moments...I Liked It!  I am really glad that he did;  the steak was the perfect temp on the inside and melted like, \"buttah\" in my mouth. I would have to say everything was perfect except the Asparagus Fries.  I know right...how could something called \"asparagus fries\" not be yummy?  But they are battered so heavily that they come out sort of phallic.  It wasn't so offsetting that I didn't eat them.  But, the reality is that they were kind of blah; surprising since they were supposed to be seasoned with black pepper.  The potatoes were amaze balls and I would recommend them.   All in all, it was a fun evening and if asked if I would go again, I would say, \"run that back.\"  In the end I have enough seafood leftovers (that they boxed and put in the cooler) and steak to feed a third world country or skip a few meals.  Well played.    #runthatback.",

I like the Vibe here, very busy and the Phoenix crowd is great !! I ordered the filet that was cooked perfectly and I loved the grilled snap peas. The only thing I had an issue with, if you could call it that, was that I bought a bottle of wine, that I took the remnants with me; however I had to pour a glass for myself at one time. With 4 bartenders it is all about service after you spend $125 for a bottle of wine, I should not have to pour my glass. Not a big deal but again, I should not have to with a place as classy as this.  I will certainly be back, my steak was the best !!!",

Service you would expect form top rated restaurants. My wife would go to the restroom, some how the server would know that and come refill our waters, re-fold her napkin and de-crumb (not sure if there's a better word) the table. The drinks again stellar. My Grey Goose Dirty Martini was dialed into perfection, with almost another 1/2 serving in the shaker left with the drink at the table. The atmosphere and decor again stellar! The decor and architecture was very transitional leaning towards modern. Everything was clean, neat and pressed.   It was my birthday dinner and they even gave me a nice Happy Birthday handwritten and signed card from the Hostess and Server.

From the warm bread, to the flavorful shrimp appetizer, and the Mac n cheese, creamed spinach and the del monte steak that we all shared was so delicious.

To put it simply, one of the best meals I have ever had. The service was outstanding. They sat us without a reservation (OK, it was a Monday night). The waitress was enthusiastic and took care of anything and everything we needed. The food stole the show. I was curious about the fried deviled eggs as an appetizer, and they were awesome. Our entrees included a 12 oz. Filet, cooked to perfection, and my wife had the crab legs (MP). I wish I had a picture of the crab legs. They were the biggest I have ever seen, spilling over the plate. They were prepared perfectly, and prepared to be enjoyed, with very little work involved. The sides were outstanding, as were the cocktails (old fashioned, wine). The timing of everything was on point. Steak 44 is without a doubt, our new, go to,\"enjoy yourself\" restaurant in all of the Phoenix/Valley area. Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "Steak 44 has definitely grown on me over the years since it opened... it's a great spot for a splurge (both with the prices and the rich food) to celebrate a special occasion.  Steak 44 is definitely right up there with Mastro's / City Hall with more of a local feel, and it doesn't hurt that it's also super conveniently located close to my home.  You probably cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, but some of my personal favorites that I seem to order again and again are:  -Oysters -Chilean Sea Bass (although sometimes you may find they are out of it :( -Bone in Ribeye -Brussels Sprouts -Butter Cake  Everything on the menu is shareable.  I typically try to find someone I'm dining with who wants to split the ribeye or the sea bass and then share starters, sides and dessert.  Steak 44 makes a solid dirty martini and has an excellent wine list as well.  Service is attentive and professional, but if you ask for any recommendations, be prepared as you'll likely be sold on the highest priced item(s) - food and drink included.  Note... they also charge for their special ice balls.  (My husband can't seem to get over this!)    Their bread basket doesn't quite compare with Mastro's, and while their Butter Cake is amazing, I think I like the latter better too.  That being said, you cannot go wrong at Steak 44 and if you're wanting to go and looking for company, please let me know... you won't have to twist my arm to join!",

The tables are long, so we had to hand him everything. The setting are full so it took him a couple of trips. So we sat there silent for quite awhile.  It's hard to explain how stupid it was, I really almost lost it. In hind sight, I should have asked him to have the manager come to clear the settings.

The atmosphere is such that you can have a business dinner, date, or special occasion.  I started with my usual Caesar salad. It was good and I liked the addition of a poached egg on top. It had a good amount of grated cheese on top. My friend got the superfoods salad and loved it.  The bone in filet (the smaller one) was amazing. It was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. We split four sides between three of us. The creme brulee corn was killer. The waiter recommended it and we added it at the last minute. Worth every calorie!! The roasted sweet potatoes with marshmallows was another hit. They didn't skimp on the sweet and gooey marshmallow cream on top of the savory potatoes. Both those sides would be a great addition to any Thanksgiving table.  The Brussels sprouts were ok. The creamy Mac and cheese was death-row-meal worthy! I ate way to much because everything was soooooo good.  We split dessert, the crispy banana split, which was also yummy and had enough ice cream and lots of whipped cream. It was one friend's birthday and they added a candle and wrote Happy Birthday on the plate.  Timing was a little off. It took awhile for my cocktail. I would wait to order my main dish until after the salad because the food came out fast. I would definitely come back!",

Starting off the drinks we ordered were great, with just the perfect amount of alcohol in our cocktails. The peach ginger and the classic Moscow mules were a great start. I went light by ordering a 12oz Ny strip and it was so tender and juicy, the au jus that was with it gave it such a great flavor! Also, the sides we ordered (shareable) were kennebec potatoes, Mac and cheese, and creamed corn. ALL WERE BANGERS. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and nice and soft inside, the Mac and cheese was creamy and the creamed corn was just outstanding. As this was a birthday celebration, the dessert was on the house as we got the beignet that were perfect, paired with a vanilla glaze, and Nutella. Now for credit where it's due, the experience here was mostly because of our server Josh. He was amazing! He created a rapport with our table and quickly became a very friendly and personable server and showed us exceptional service. I never really write about servers unless it's REALLY good. So Josh is definitely a great one! I could tell he was from Chicago from his accent and we all quickly shared experiences. This is what customer service is about, more than feeling welcome, our table bonded very well with him as he recommend his favorites on the menu and what to get. I would definitely be going back because of him. Overall this place has an outstanding menu and service.  100% CERTIFIED BANGER",

The experience I had is the reason for the 3 stars. We probably had the worst table in the restaurant. I was there to celebrate my birthday. The hostess knew this so I was expecting a much better table location. They sat us on the aisle across the rail from a table placed in the bar. It was like we were sharing dinner with strangers. Then when the manager came to their table to discuss their status, the conversation was so loud and annoying. He stayed there quite awhile with that couple. We literally had to wait until he left to continue our own conversation before we could hear each other.   When our  server (Megan)was taking my order, i  kept getting interrupted so someone could pass by her. Another annoying moment. Then when she took my husband's order, she asked him if we were sharing our entree. I was straight up insulted by the implication. My husband ordered the sea bass and was told, they were out. This should have been told to us when we were first given our menus.  Not after giving us ample time to decide what we wanted.  It was disappointing. He ended up picking the salmon as a last minute decision.   She also never came back to ask if we wanted a second drink. When another mgr came to clear our table my husband had to ask for another drink. When she brought his, she still didn't ask me, again, I had to ask her myself.   This experience left us feeling like our table was an afterthought. It was not the Birthday celebration I was expecting. It was extremely disappointing.",

The corn cream brulee was outstanding, along with the dinner rolls. The Mac and cheese wasn't a hit with us, but, we will definitely make the drive from Sedona more often for this steak.",

There was a card wishing us a happy anniversary from the manager. The staff was great. Answered all of our questions and made good recommendations based on what we wanted. I had the strip and my husband had the bone in ribeye. Both were good but the ribeye was excellent! We also had the loaded baked potato and the Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was creamy and we loved the different cheeses they used. Oh and the bread! They bring out fresh buns in a tiny cast iron skillet that are covered with butter, salt and parmesan cheese. We enjoyed the meal so much I didn't even take pictures. Would nightly recommend this. We enjoyed a free dessert in honor of our anniversary and took it to go! Amazing!",

The restaurant offers complimentary valet and has a classy look to it. The waitress that we had was very knowledgeable of her menu and recommended a variety of items. I had a cucumber mule and was very pleased with my cocktail. For my main dish I had a 12oz filet and my girlfriend had a 8oz both were ordered medium rare. The filets were served on a hot plate and we could still hear the steak sizzling as it was served. We also ordered their Mac and Cheese, whipped potatoes and their very delicious corn brulee. The steak had a very tasty chard and warm pink center. I'm glad I took my girlfriend because after wiping my plate clean I helped finish hers. I highly recommend you try this restaurant if you are in the mood for a quality steak. I will definitely be back next time I am in town.",

I received a call from the manager Rob who traveled to a local restaurant to see if he could get a diabetic desert because they didn't have one on the menu. He was not able to get one and was going to travel to another restaurant to see if he can find one. I said no thank you. We arrived in which my husband was given a congratulatory card. The executive chef (Chef Watson) came out to meet him and shake his hand. Chef Watson sent out two exemplary complementary appetizers and made a beautiful sugar free desert for the table. The Manager came to the table several times to check on us and our waitress definitely loved what she did. If you live in Phoenix and have not eaten at steak 44 you are doing it wrong. This was by far the best experience we have ever had and to top it all off the food was amazing. To Rob, Chef Wilson and Heather and all the other staff that took exceptional care of us. Thank you for making a special night perfect!",

The bartenders are real pros and provide for great service.  I love the steak and fries happy hour dish.  It's delicious and just the right amount of food.  I was in a couple of weeks ago with some friends.  The service at our table in the bar area was outstanding.  In particular, Daniel was such a gracious host.  The bone-in ribeye was mouthwatering.  All the sides were great.  I also really enjoyed trying a couple of wines from their new wine menu.  To top it off, the beignets for dessert made me feel like I was in New Orleans.  Well done Steak 44!",

Hubby and I had been wanting to come here for a while, so for my birthday dinner, here we are.  David was our server and he was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  First was the bread...it's freshly made with garlic butter and sea salt (you can get either one on it, we went with both).  It comes in a little skillet and is piping hot.  Yummy!  My dad always said, if the bread in a restaurant is good, the food will be, too.  So far, he's been right on the money with that!!  For our appetizers, hubby got the braised pork belly and I got the meatballs w/marinara...both were wonderful!  The pork belly has a little kick to it, but also a sweetness, which was very tasty.    Next, our entrees, hubby got the 12 oz. filet and I got the 8 oz. filet (I got sauteed bleu cheese on mine)...they were so perfectly cooked.  I barely needed the knife to cut through it, so tender.  Along with the main dishes, we each got a potato side...I got the roasted sweet potatoes and hubby got the crispy hasselbeck potato...and we shared the brussell sprouts.  All 3 sides were very, very good!!!  And, since it was my birthday, I got to choose a dessert, which we shared (cause we were stuffed!!).  I picked out the brioche chocolate chip bread pudding w/vanilla ice cream.  It was decadent and chocolatey and crispy on top and warm and so, so amazing!  If you haven't already noticed, we had an outstanding meal.  Everything from the greeting at the hostess stand to the friendly valet as we were leaving was perfect.  This is definitely a great place to go and I can't wait for another special evening to head back here.",

If it had been our first time, we would never go back.  We were celebrating my and my mother in law's birthdays like we do every year. They acknowledged both celebrations when we were sat, but the waiter only acknowledged my mother in law's the rest of the night. The food was just plain bad. My filet mignon had a funny taste and was full of fat and tough to cut. My husband's was overcooked, and the cocktails were bad. Out waiter was MIA pretty much all night. At the end of the night a birthday dessert with candle was brought out to my mother in law but not me. By this point the evening was so sub par this was just funny.  We were just so disappointed because this place is always so good. $400 down the drain.",

    "text": "Extremely surprised by the great reviews and recommendations from friends. I chose this place to celebrate my friend's birthday and I was apologizing by the end of the night because of how bad the experience was. Maybe we just got really unlucky; the service from our waiter (Thorenzo) was beyond terrible, and the food was average at best. Went recently to another similar oyster bar/steakhouse and received the best service and the food was amazing. Won't return to Steak 44, or try Dominick's or Ocean 44 as I was planning.   PROS 1. The valet and hostess provided good service. 2. The guy who brought out the sizzling plates was working very hard. 3. Creamed corn and hasselback potatoes were good, Bone-in Kansas City strip was very tasty with a bit of a kick. Other food was not very good (see below).  CONS 1. Still waiting, 7 days later, for the call that I was told I'd receive from the Manager about our experience. Crickets. Why have the girl call and ask how your experience was and say the Manager will call, if there is no follow-through from the Manager? 2. Where to start with our waiter, Thorenzo, who made the whole experience pretty awful. He was so forgetful and didn't stop over at all (we had to get his attention anytime we needed something, such as placing our order), but he seemed to be paying a lot of attention to the 3 other tables around us. He was also not friendly whatsoever; seemed like it was painful for him to be doing his job. 3. We didn't receive bread even though we were told it would be \"right out.\" Had to ask 2x before we received bread when other tables around us were on round 2 of bread 4. Forgot my friend's birthday dessert (the waiter realized when he brought us the bill and kindly comp'd the gelato my friend ordered for dessert). 5. Did NOT pack up all of the leftovers I wanted to take home. The next day I was pissed after thinking about spending almost $300 on dinner for the 2 of us to not even have 1/3 of my bone-in ribeye steak packed up and the truffle butter ($8) not packed up either. I wasn't even sure if the steak they packed up was mine because the amount was so much less than what I left on the plate.  6. It was SO hot in the restaurant. I know it's hot and humid this time of year in Phoenix, but it didn't seem like the A/C was working or low enough. When it kicked on it was nice, but it quickly went off and we were back to sweating (seriously sweating (not just clammy) inside of the restaurant). 7. The food: Raw oysters were room temperature so I was concerned about food poisoning, the bone-in ribeye was way more fatty than it should be, the bread was stale/dry.",

I almost begged it off but glad I didn't!  Recently I have almost lost all faith in steak houses.  Most of my recent meals have been no where near the cost.  S44 is the complete opposite.  I would almost be willing to pay double for the steak I had here.    The meal started with some delicious Crispy Shrimp Deviled Eggs and the giant Shrimp Cocktail.    Next up was the salad course.  I ordered the wedge salad, one of my favorites.  It was topped with a great blue cheese dressing and lots of Bacon. All my favorites.    The main course!  The main event!  The thing we all were waiting for.  I ordered the NY Strip. I have moved away from Ribeye and Filet as the NY just has a better marble to it.  For a side dish I had the Creamed Spinach.    The steak arrived on a 500 degree sizzling plate floating in clarified butter!  The flesh was cooked to a perfect Medium Rare temperature.  The thickness of the steak was what impressed me the most.  They didn't skimp on meat!    The service was great. Food, outstanding.  Experience, perfect.    If I get asked to go back to Phoenix for work, even in the heat of summer, again, I will say yes, as long as I can go to Steak 44 for dinner!",

For happy hour, I'd recommend the steak and fries AND the braised pork belly. You can't go wrong other than you will order it again while you sit there drinking either the lemon martini or double old fashioned. Pick one or both of these delectable drinks.

We were able to get a table by the kitchen and it was very intimate. We started with the Parmesan bread. My husband ordered the rib eye, medium rare, and crispy hasselback potato, and I ordered the New York strip. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese as well. Everything was just so perfect. My husband really enjoyed his steak. When I usually order medium, it always comes out too done, however this was perfect. The mac and cheese was very creamy. The potato was such a huge portion. An entire potato.    This is a very elegant restaurant and I know most people said that it's not kid friendly. However, we did bring our 5 month old daughter. It was father's day and we weren't going to leave her with a sitter and my husband deserved a special evening for father's day. Customer service was very good, however there was no changing table in the men's restroom which was unfortunate. There was a unisex bathroom, which I'm not sure if there was one in there, but I would hope so. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely come back.",

I felt the eating space was a bit tight where we were seated. Luckily, we had a nice group of people sitting beside us. As for the food...it was phenomenal!

    "text": "The old adage \"you get what you pay for\" is most certainly hit or miss when it comes to dining out.  For every high dollar etherial experience (Binkley's comes to mind), there's a letdown (Ocotillo comes to mind).  And perhaps that's why it took so long for me to give Steak 44 a try.  This place is definitely a once in a blue moon splurge for those of us in the American middle class, but I knew that going in.  The real question for me was whether Steak 44 could live up to the hype behind its quality and its top notch service.  Finally, after being on my list for almost 2 years, I made the journey here for dinner on a Tuesday night.  Steak 44 occupies was used to be the home of Cork & Cleaver.  I'd actually been to Cork & Cleaver a number of times before they ultimately closed.  The restaurant today looks and feels nothing like its Cork & Cleaver days.  Distinctly refined, dimly lit, formal table cloths, dark accents throughout, and (at least today) a rotating assortment of 90s tunes playing in the background.  I was greeted warmly by the hostesses up front and treated like royalty by my waiter throughout the evening.  The Mastro family restaurant empire built this place and it seems this is the most popular of the Mastro brands here in the valley.  So let's eat.   As per tradition, I was immediately served with a skillet of freshly baked garlic bread to start.  Super soft with a buttery garlic texture on top to get the night started.  Next up, I needed a drink.  I opted for Steak 44's \"Perfect\" Manhattan.  Dry & sweet vermouth, Del Bac Classic whiskey, and a Luxardo cherry garnish.  They actually give you two servings with your drink order, for which I am most appreciative.  A lovely, smooth, easy drinking cocktail to get things started.  For my app, my waiter gave a strong endorsement to the King Crab & Avocado Stack.  Alaskan King Crab stacked atop a fried wanton, stacked atop a bed of avocado.  A relatively simple dish all things considered, but absolutely phenomenal.  A copious amount of crab and avocado with the wanton providing a great contrast with its crunchy texture.  For the main event, this is a steakhouse after all.  So I opted for a Petite Filet Mignon (medium-rare).  But I'd heard the crispy shrimp here is awesome so I ordered that as a topper for my steak.  Additionally, I went with a side of Chef Watson's Potatoes.  The shrimp is fried with sweet thai chili peppers and garlic aioli.  The potatoes are a mix of au gratin, caramelized onions, and a very liberal layer of gouda cheese.  In a word, perfect.  Steak was cooked perfectly.  The shrimp offered a crunchy seafood contrast with just a slight kick of heat.  And the potatoes were an endlessly savory, stick-to-your-ribs side.  Lastly, I had *just* enough room for a sweet finisher.  And my waiter advocated heavily for their Ultimate Warm Vanilla Caramel Cake.  Vanilla bean gelato atop a warm cake drenched with pecans and caramel sauce and whipped cream on the side.  The whipped cream on the side was admittedly strange, but the cake and gelato were fantastic.  A mix of warm cake and cold gelato with some crunchy savory notes from the toppings.  Not too sweet, but enough of a counterbalance to the steak to cleanse the palate and leave my tummy full and happy.  Total cost for the food, cocktail, tax, and tip came to $170.  Like I said, its a splurge destination (Yelp should label this as a $$$$ restaurant instead of $$$, by the way).  Still, if you've got the money to do this once (or every once in awhile), this place stacks up VERY favorably to other valley steakhouses I've been to.  It may not have the history of a Durant's or the glamour of a Ruth's Chris.  But Steak 44 is certainly worthy of the love it receives from the Yelp community and diners in general.  The food is outstanding, the service is top of the line, and the aesthetics are formal but relaxed.  The Mastros have clearly hit gold with their Arcadia neighborhood concept.  Even if this turns out to be my only visit, it was well worth the trouble.",

At Steak 44, you'll find a beautiful classy white table cloth restaurant with a solid wine menu and a steak menu that of course comes with a seafood tower. To start, we had the calamari as well as burrata that were both decent starters. The seafood tower I'd say isn't as good as Mastros - comes with oysters (which tasted a bit off the night we were there) and crab legs (which were good). For steak, we shared a rib eye and filet. Loved the rib eye, well cooked and had a good amount of fat and truffle butter. The filet was ok tho I personally found it less flavorful than I wouldve expected. Service was excellent though. A quality place.",

The restaurant can be rather loud, significantly loud, depending on where you're seated. You pay for the quality, but their shrimp are some of the best jumbo shrimp I've had in quite awhile. My wife loved the crab legs & we both loved the selection of sauces (especially their atomic horseradish). Flavor options/combinations are excellent & absolutely what I'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Our only knock on the bone-in filet was their house rub. Some of that may be on me for not reading/listening close enough, but I'd like to see it with just salt & pepper personally. Beyond that, the meat was excellent & mine was tender enough to cut with a fork. Very nice experience overall.",

For sides, Chef Watson's potatoes and the creme corn creme brulee are recommended!  I suggest you stay away from the asparagus fries and just order a side of asparagus.

We got there around 4:45pm and there were plenty of seats around the bar as well as high top tables.   My fiance and I ordered our drinks while we waited for our friends. I ordered the Double Old Fashioned (rocks - luxardo - muddled fresh fruit) while my fiance ordered the Lemon Martini (lemon infused vodka - fresh lemon - sugar rim). I'm usually not an old fashioned kind of gal but that one was delicious.   For food, we ordered the steak and fries (sliced filet mignon - parmesan truffle fries) and braised pork belly (local honey - sweet thai chili - sauteed spinach). I thoroughly enjoyed both. The best thing besides the company we were with was the yummy rolls. Again, I try to avoid carbs but I couldn't help myself. The rolls were airy and fluffy.   Service was quick and friendly.   We decided to rideshare there but Steak 44 offered complimentary valet if you decide to drive yourself.",

Truly one of the best steakhouses in the valley, the combination of outstanding service, food, and ambiance truly makes this place one of the best dining experiences in the valley.  With my recent dining experience, I put Steak 44 over the top from Mastro's Ocean Club.  Bold statement?  Please let me indulge you......  So my our wedding anniversary is on May 15th and we were going to hit up our go to spot Mastro's Ocean Club, cause it's always been spectacular and you know exactly what you're going to get.  Excellent food, ambiance and service, so I was very pleasantly surprised that Steak 44 over delivered and exceeded my expectations.     We made a reservation on May 15th at 5:30 PM and were seated right away.  The place was pretty busy from the happy hour crowd and had a good energy to the place.  The only negative thing I will say is, our table was between two big groups and it got pretty loud at times, but that's something that can't be controlled.  The place is beautiful inside and you can see the kitchen and the fresh seafood that they have on display.  It's pretty impressive to say the least.  Food-For our appetizers we shared the Calamari & Shrimp and the heirloom tomato salad.  Both dishes were excellent, the calamari and shrimp were hot and well-seasoned and my wife really enjoyed the salad and was a big fan of the champagne vinaigrette that they used.  For our entrees I ordered the bone in ribeye, while she ordered the new York strip and we shared the crispy hasselback potato, sauteed sweet corn and roasted brussel sprouts.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, I ordered it medium-rare and the steak was absolutely on point.  The sides were very good as well.  For dessert, we planned on ordering something, but the waitress brought us over a complimentary butter cake with whipped cream.  It was delicious.  Overall, just a wonderful dining experience, and Steak 44 really delivered.  Service-The customer service we received truly made this place special.  From the greeting from the hostess, to the friendly waitress and even the manager checked on us to make sure everything was good, all top notch service that you would expect from a nice steakhouse.  The waitress was on top of her game, constantly checked on us, asked us how the dish turned out, and was very personable.  I even received a follow up phone call the next day, just checking in on my experience.  Thanks pretty impressive customer service right there.  You convinced me for sure.  I'll be adding a 5 star review for this place, and based off the previous reviews, it's not secret why this place is one of the best steakhouses in the Valley.  I would HIGHLY recommend this place for a wonderful dining experience.",

This might actually be my all-time favorite steak for the cut I had (filet) - and I've eaten in fancy-schmancy steakhouses across the country.   Reasoning: I'm picky about the temperature and salting at every steakhouse I go to, and even those two elements alone are hard to master. When you're dropping hundreds of dollars on a meal, I don't think you should even need the salt + pepper shaker at the table; the food should be expertly seasoned. Everything was superbly done here. In addition, there was also a super juicy factor to the meat. Quite a nice and unexpected level of deliciousness. *This is not meant to sound condescending - only that I knew it would be good, and it was even higher than my expectations.   Other restaurant perks:   Masculine, sexy feel to the dining room.  Crab legs and fried deviled eggs, yum. My dirty Grey Goose martini was delicious + and it almost seemed endless (no drop left behind in the shakers) Excellent service as well.  Top notch. Will be back soon.",

They crammed us into our table and then the service was scripted and not personal.  The waitstaff continually bumped our chairs put trays next to our table with splattering butter and then refuse from others.  The team seemed so task driven the forgot about the customer.  Even when they checked on us it was in passing and not attentive. Next stop in Phoenix will be to a different restaurant.  Time to try something new.",

    "text": "It's our second visit here and we had a totally opposite experience than the 1 st time and I l gonna write this review here as nobody has contacted me back from the restaurant since past month as I have sent an email them. We knew exactly what to avoid at that place which is a bar area. My bf wanted to come back here as he loves oysters and they really have great and fresh selection of seafood over there. I made reservation online and placed order for the desert in advance as it was my bf bday, I also called the restaurant in advance to request specific seating area as we knew it gets extremely crowded on Saturday nights and if you look in lost of reviews people don't like loud and obnoxious bar area, so I asked to be seated in main dining area, they said no problem. We had reservation for 6:45 getting seated right away with no wait...bar area. I told hostess it's been a misunderstanding bcs I particularly have requested not to be seated in the bar area; she goes no problem so she walks us to PATIO area through another bar; I told her we will not be sitting here as this is another bar area and it's cold here. Hostess leaves and another one comes back to let us know that they only have tables for 4 people and they won't be able one to us. Oh great how kind of you. Having in mind it's 7 pm at that point we didn't leave the place as it's gonna be impossible to find any other dining spot at that time. Server shows up, he is on training. We asked about a wine suggestion for a pinot noir, he tells us he has no good idea about red wines but still never asks his trainer to the table for maybe a little better of suggestion. So we just ordered something of the list. We got oysters for appetizer, they are great of course, steaks prepared to order and no complains here, sides are tasty except I would probably skip on lobster mashed potatoes , those were just little too runny and tasted likes boxed instant potatoes , definitely not worth the price. In a meanwhile the bar area is getting over crowded and all these people just keep pouring into patio area, at this point we have 4 drunk chicks with martini glasses bumping right into my back and apologizing constantly and guys talking about sports and screaming for another beer across the room. Have you ever ate 300 worth of dinner in the crowded room while people constantly are bumping into you? It felt like a night at the nightclub.  The sad part nobody from staff cared and not a once we seen a single manager ! How disappointing is that! We ask for the bill and of course they forget to bring my bf birthday cake, server showed up with 2 cookies and a bill. After I asked them where was his dessert they brought it out. We just paid the bill and left, they took the dessert of our bill \" as they made a mistake \" , oh please do you think anyone cares about $10 pudding after you have ruined whole our night ?",

I've been to just about every well known steakhouse in the valley, along with any butcher shop I can get my hands on that sells prime grade/dry aged meat. Rib eye or rib cap would be my go to but have grilled more tenderloins and strips than I could count. Last night I went for the bone in filet topped with foie gras, she had the  bone in KC Strip. Like I said, best steak in the valley. Period.  We were in a group of six so got to try a lot of the menu. The fried deviled eggs are as good as they sound, The seafood tower and accompanying sauces were as good as any I've had anywhere. If there's a must try side it has to be the corn creme brulee, absolutely amazing. The crab and shrimp mac and cheese was fine, but I prefer the truffle mac and cheese at City Hall. Speaking of truffles we did have the double baked truffle potato...awesome. The only let down on sides were the brussels sprouts, good? Sure...awesome and a must try? Eh....will try something else next time  Service was absolutely top notch from the time we entered the door thru the entire meal. For desert we had a few and the red velvet bread pudding is just ridiculous. Finished the evening with a 20 year Tawny...  Can't wait to go back, would recommend to any steak lover",

The caesar salad was bland, the shrimp was overcooked and extremely fishy, and the mashed potatoes were tasteless. My petite filet was just okay.   But the real issue of the night was the service. Our waitress left our glasses empty 30 minutes at a time and had awful table management skills. She passed our table multiple times and didn't take note of our glasses or our plates. We sat waiting...and waiting...and waiting for everything. Just getting our bill back took 20 minutes.   The only good parts were the brussels sprouts and my bf's NY strip. But that's it. They also used to serve this amazing butter cake dessert, which I found out tonight they took off their menu. It was a fitting end to our disappointing evening.

    "text": "How could I give this place only 2 stars???  My experience here was bittersweet...My husband and I went here for his company dinner and while the food was stellar, my purse was stolen and that ruined the experience for me.  I had my purse throughout dinner and even at the end of dinner.  But once we moved from the party room in the back to the main bar area up front to finish our drinks I don't know what happened to my purse.  Since there weren't any other customers in the party room and we were the VERY LAST customers to leave, I can only assume it was stolen by someone on staff which is really disappointing given the caliber of this restaurant.  The next day I called and spoke with a man named Dan.  After explaining what happened the night before, he said he would personally look himself.  After 2 hours he called me back and said they had searched high and low all over the restaurant and nothing had turned up.  There'd been no activity on my 2 debit cards after my purse was stolen, so I just assumed maybe it had fallen behind a chair or something...But when he said nothing had been turned in I knew it had to be an employee...They'd taken the cash out (150.00) and ditched the rest which included my drivers license....Let's be honest...The type of people who can afford to dine at Steak 44 don't need to steal a purse with 150 bucks in it.  I would expect this type of thing to happen at Applebees or TGI Friday's (no offence to those restaurants) or somewhere like that...But I guess I just expected more from a place like Steak 44.  I guess thieves are everywhere and you can never be too careful no matter how classy and upscale a place seems.  Unfortunately, no fault of Dan's or the owner, but I will not dine here again and we surely won't be having anymore company dinners here after this fiasco. With that being said, the food and wine selection was exceptional.  I had the massive crab claws, shrimp cocktail, filet with shrimp, and my hubby had the filet with truffle butter and lobster, our sides were brussel sprouts and hasselback potatoes, all very good and paired perfectly with a glass of Stags' Leap cab.",

We made a reservation for 6 on a Sunday, and we were seated immediately in a quiet back room. Matt, our server, was attentive but not overly so. The manager Daniel stopped by to chat halfway through the meal and when he found out it was our anniversary, he told us to save room for dessert.   That was hard to do! I had the small strip with bleu cheese on top, with a side of hasselback potatoes. My husband had the steak, no bleu cheese, with a baked potato on the side. We both loved the hot rolls straight out of the oven.   Dessert was incredible - a warm butter cake with ice cream and caramel sauce, and warm beignets with vanilla and chocolate sauces on the side. The presentation was incredible, too!  We'll be back before our next anniversary. :)",

I had the bone in filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly and out of this world delicious. The lobster mashed potatoes were 100% on par with the rest of our meal (garlicky, lobster goodness!), as was our server. Our complimentary anniversary dessert - butter cake with strawberries, was irresistible.  The whole restaurant is gorgeous but we will definitely hit up the bar area next time - it looked very warm and welcoming (and packed).",

The creamed corn was to sweet for my taste, it was more like candied corn. The baked potato with truffle    also left a little to be desired because it seemed like I was eating more the skin of the potato due to the potato being small. The crab and mac was good but not fantastic. Finally the star of the show a bone in rib eye \"Black and Blue.\" All I have to say, \"Fantastic!\"",

It was a little high when I saw the price but it was huge so that was ok, I only needed one. The food was good, my family and I had steaks and crab legs which mom loved. The portions are small but I think that's why they load you up on that yummy garlic bread before your meal comes. The reason I decided to give only 3 stars is it's really over priced. The \"servers assistant\" is simply a ridiculous concept. The server, and the assistant began to clear all plates before mom was even done eating. I thought it was really rude. I'm not sure I'll be back.... but it was an experience to say the least.",

If anyone has ever been to Ruth's Chris Steak House, that's what this place is but more of a modern vibe - and my wife and I would agree that it is not as good. The service was excellent but should be for the price. We both ordered a BLT wedge, but it wasn't too inspiring. I prefer the lettuce to be grilled or a little more crisp vs. keeping all the water absorbed into it. My wife had the filet mignon and I ordered a big, fat ribeye. They were both over-seasoned. The really hot plate is a nice touch and keeps the steak cooking but over-seasoned is over-seasoned, which unfortunately can't be removed by an extremely hot plate. For sides, we ordered brussels sprouts (overcooked) and whipped mashed potatoes (overall good). The desserts were creative and excellent. That vanilla caramel butter cake is pretty great. Because of the excellent service, I upped my star rating but food-wise, I'd give it a 3. I am going to try Mastro's to see if that is better.",

    "text": "Loved this place!  My friend who is a local suggested that I stop in for their happy hour (seems like happy hours are a big deal in the Valley of the Sun as everyone goes to one!)  We got here early and were practically the only ones in the place on this Monday night.  So we took a seat at the bar, where we were taken excellent care of by John,bartender extrodinaire!  My martini was perfectly poured and I liked that there was a little \"dividend\" left over which quickly made it's way into my glass.  We liked the bar so much we decided to settle in and enjoy our dinner there and John made sure that our entire experience was a nice as had we been sitting at one of the tables.  While there are plenty of happy hour specials we ended up going off the dinner menu as they had soft shelled crabs which are my favorite and my friend wanted steak.  For our appetizer we had some fresh oysters which were delicious as well as one of the happy hour specials.  Our food was delicious and perfectly prepared, and everyone we met was so welcoming and inviting.  In fact, we even got a tour of the entire place by Nick, the manager, who really went out of his way to show us the open kitchen, the glassed in booths that surround it, and several large rooms that would be perfect for hosting your next special gathering.  While I don't live in the area, you can bet I have told all my friends who do, to stop in and check this place out.  The ambiance is lovely (I loved the windowed room off the bar), the staff is well trained, efficient and friendly, and the food tops it all.  Check it out!   I know I will be back the next time I am in town!",

It didn't have that high end steakhouse feel because of the bar area that was part of the restaurant with a couple of tvs. The food was top notch but the thing that made my night was the service. Our waitress Sarah was awesome and very friendly. She treated us like we were the most important table she was serving. The bus boy Tanner Jax was the cherry on top. He had conversations and jokes with me and my boyfriend. He was the one that recommended our dessert and it did not disappoint. The caramel cake was phenomenal. This restaurant is a must for anyone that is looking to have a nice steak dinner in Phoenix. I'm from Connecticut and I will always come here whenever I'm back in town. Keep up the great work!!",

The bar was crowded but when we found 2 seats at the bar, we were pleasantly greeted and served some awesome fried deviled eggs and very generous pours on our drinks.  We got seated a little earlier then our reservations but no complaint there!  We were seated in the back room which was great.  A happy anniversary card was on the table with a hand written note inside ... nice touch!  Our waitress, Elissa, was great!  In fact, all the service was outstanding ... the hostesses, the guys serving water, plates being picked up, table cleaned off afterwards, and then a visit by the manager, Jake, to make sure everything was going well and even brought me a sample of a whiskey he thought I'd like!  We both had the bone-in fillets with the steak fries and some asparagus.  I had the chop salad and she had the wedge.  To finish it off, we had the chocolate cake. EVERYTHING was freaking amazing!!!   Then they gave us a \"surprise desert\" to take home with us and told us not to open it until we got home.  It was fried bread with some extras ... you can't make this up.  And then if all this wasn't enough ... I get a phone call the next morning asking how our visit was, etc and they look forward to seeing us again.  Yes, yes you definitely will!  Thank you for the wonderful \"experience\" ... by far the best we've had in many many years.",

Good thing this was a business expense, as the cost was beyond my regular eating out budget. But I would consider for special occasions.   We started with oysters, jumbo shrimp, and the pork belly. All excellent.  For dinner, there was a filter and lobster (surf n turf), two steak farina, and I had the Regular NY Strip Oscar. The table got very quiet when the food arrived. No one wanted to stop eating long enough to talk, it was that good!  S'Mores in a Jar, and the an apple cake special that was amazing.  All in all, a great experience. Great service as well.

    "text": "Great place to grab a steak! The steak I had, the wagyu 8oz filet was cooked perfectly. My only complain was that the plate was so hot, the butter was popping all over me.  We had a seafood tower as well. The blue point oysters were fresh and tasty.  For dessert we had the beignet tree. The beignets were good but not great. Not light and pillowy, as i believe one should be. They were a little harder, as if they may have been slightly over cooked.  The service was great. Everything came out in proper time and everyone was very accommodating. A great restaurant!",

    "text": "This restaurant provides TENDER loving care to each of its guests. Yeah, let that one sink in.   I absolutely LOVED this place. The atmosphere is definitely upscale, but I felt extremely comfortable in the restaurant at the same time.   We started off with the fried deviled eggs, which had a delicious spicy dipping sauce. The way these were prepared was fantastic and unlike any deviled eggs I have eaten before. My boyfriend who hates deviled eggs scarfed them down.   Next they provided a fluffy, mountain of bread which one could easily fill up on and be completely content with the evening.   My boyfriend ordered the heirloom tomato salad, which we had no idea was just a sliced up tomato. It was good, but this was the one thing that didn't not blow me away. My suggestion would be to select a different salad, or just skip the salad and go for more meat. Because. Meat.   We were so #blessed to enjoy a ribeye AND a tuna steak. The ribeye was cooked perfectly and I coated it with truffle butter, which is a must. The tuna steak had an amazing dipping sauce as well.   Yes to all desserts. Yes to everything.   I was so impressed by our server, who knew it was our anniversary and brought us a delicious caramel dessert. After being completely full, he brought us some chocolate chip cookie bites to just explode. Finally, the manager stopped by to check in on us to make sure we had the perfect meal.   Please. Go here.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here for our anniversary dinner and both really enjoyed it.  Our server was excellent.  Very sweet.  The server's assistant was incredibly attentive as well. The service itself was very quick.  We ordered calamari as an appetizer, and it was brought out just a few minutes later, just moments after we started trying the delicious, complimentary bread.    The restaurant has an interesting layout.  It's big, but it only feels big when you're searching for the bathroom.  Otherwise there is enough space between the tables where it feels intimate enough.  The calamari and shrimp was amazing, though my wife thought there should have been more shrimp.  I thought the Ribeye had a tad too much seasoning on it, but my wife loved her Filet, and the portions were of course big enough where Steak and Eggs the morning after were exceptional.  :-)    They very sweetly bought us a dessert which was decorated with \"Happy Anniversary\" in chocolate, and I thought an excellent service touch was, in addition to the Manager stopping by the table near the end of the meal, that they called the next day to check and see how everything was.    I was deciding between giving Steak 44 4 or 5 stars, but based on the exceptional service alone, I don't think this is a place that should be missed for any special occasion.  My wife even said she liked it better than \"Mastro's.\"  That's saying something.  Enjoy!",

All the sides are great, I love the asparagus fries in particular. Cocktail Drinks aren't really their specialty but they have an amazing list of different wine. We were a party of 18, I wish they would offer us a private room but I guess that needs to be reserved through an event coordinator, overall great experience, but definitely on the pricier side.",

The service was also top notch. Our reservation was at 7:30 and we showed up early at 7:00 intending to wait in the bar, but they got us right in and didn't have to wait at all!

    "text": "Oh Em Gee this place was awesome-sauce!!! I was told about this place from a friend of mine, and finally got around to going here for dinner on October 17th. And I was given the tip to make a reservation prior to going as it gets busy on the weekends, and I'm sure glad I did!!! Even with a reservation, the wait was 15-mins or so for our table, which wasn't a big deal -- we just ended up going to the bar and grabbing a drink. (I got a peachy something -- super yummy!)  The atmosphere and ambiance at Steak 44 was great -- people were mingling, talking, laughing, etc. and everyone there seemed to be having a great time! The hostess finally came to get us and show us to our table, which was outside, and was so cute and romantic. It was the perfect temperature outside, and we really enjoyed it (except for the 10-top table that was next to ours which congregated at the end of their table, where our table was, and decided to scream-talk with each other so my friend and I could barely hear each other across the table... we were going to start texting each other so we could communicate, and laughed about it... and then scream-talked to each other to the point of losing our voices, but it was fun times!!)   First we ordered a glass of wine, and then that sizzling, bubbling, yummy, melt-in-your-mouth, oogey gooey bread in a cast iron skillet came out. Ah-may-zing!!! Let me tell you, this bread was absolutely the best bread I've ever had; we literally had to ask our server to take the bread off the table so we wouldn't eat all of it and then not have room for dinner. But wow -- I suggest starving yourself for a few days before you go so you can go crazy and eat ALL the bread you can. (My mouth is watering just remembering that bread as I write this review.)  Looking at the menu didn't take us very long to order -- we knew exactly what we wanted: filet mignon! Our server suggested the bone-in filet as he said it was more flavorful; we were sold! As our sides, we got \"The Mashed\" and sauteed wild mushrooms. The steaks came out absolutely perfect; I've never tasted a steak that was so delicious in my life!!! They were cooked to perfection and so tender that I'm pretty sure I could've cut it with a butter-knife. The Mashed were awesome and creamy as well, just the way I like my mashed. The wild mushrooms, however, eeeeh, I wasn't a fan... Sorry Steak 44. Not sure how they were prepared, but it seemed like they were fried or something to where I wasn't even tasting mushrooms necessarily, but just fried oily something. I didn't eat them... Next time I know not to order the mushrooms.   And just when we thought I couldn't possibly eat any more, our server brought out a red velvet bread pudding dessert. So sweet!!! (Probably not as sweet as the bread pudding was though; now I LOVE sweets, but it was a little much for me when we got about half-way through.) Overall, it was such a wonderful evening. Everything... the drinks, ambiance, wine, food... were spot on! I think I may have found my new favorite steakhouse, too! I will be back soon -- Can't wait!!!",

We got there and they told us it would be just a few minutes since I had reserved a quiet table. We were sat in less than 10 minutes though so that was great. Our waiter did a fantastic job going over the wine and dinner menu with us since it was our first time. We agreed on a bottle of cab and he helped us put together a seafood tower that was so delicious! The shrimp, oysters and crab were amazing. They have 2 kinds of breads and they let you get half and half; we thought both were very good. We skipped salads so our next course was the steak. Be prepared to eat the whole thing. Seriously, go hungry. I grew up in Nebraska so I've been eating steak my entire life and I know good steak. I've been to all the great steakhouses in Arizona and many other states as well. This is the best steak I've ever tasted. I had the bone in filet and my bf had ribeye. Both were exceptional! Wow. We cannot wait to go back. We also had the side dishes of corn and asparagus, both were great. We had the beignets for dessert with the different dipping sauces. These were delicious as well! The waiter brought out a birthday card for my bf as well which was a nice way to add a personal touch. Way to go Steak 44. We can wait to come back!",

When we first came in the establishment we were made to feel so welcome- Jeremy came to our table and gave us the run down of the menu- his suggestions for appetizers were delicious & he was entertaining and engaging with us.  Plan on coming back there on my birthday!!  Hope we get to see him again.",

    "text": "This restaurant was absolutely amazing the first time we went. We sat in the very back as we were in a group of six. The service was great the food was great, the entire experience.   However our second experience was not as great. We sat in a smaller room near the kitchen with another couple. The section of space that had 4 tables in it was very small and compact. Not easy to hear people talk. Don't get me wrong the food was great but our server was awful! He didn't care to make sure our food was correct he did not come back at the appropriate times to check on us.   The dessert we ordered which was the small tree came with 5 pieces of the dessert however, it was really like 4 and a half as the 5th was so small! We had finished out dessert and the other couple we were with was finishing their cappuccinos and some of the waiters came and took our water glasses. Others had started setting up the room and the other tables as if they were preparing for a big group. And someone stood outside the section as if he were waiting to kick us out like security!   Our bills were in NO WAY cheap! We even tried to contact the manager but he never called back. To say the least we will not be returning.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Been here a couple times and I'm not so much conflicted about this rating as I am . . . well, very self-aware of my personal steak predilections.  In short, the steak here is pretty darn good.  That being said, they use so much butter on that bad boy that how much of the flavor is actually the steak itself is really obscured.  There's a no-butter option that I'll have to try next time.  In terms of ambiance, very cool.  This place is chic and bustling.  First visit was way, way too loud.  Could barely hold a conversation.  We were in a little room adjacent to the main bar and it was raucous.  Our second visit, we were in the very back room and the volume was perfect there.  Also noticed some nice semi-private booths walking back.  I ordered a ribeye both times I visited.  First time was a bone-in ordered medium-rare.  Second time was a boneless ribeye ordered medium-rare plus.  (Didn't know that was a thing.)  Our server stated that the chef recommends medium for the ribeyes, which I was hesitant to do, so I went with the medium-rare plus, which was a mistake.  I would stick to mid-rare in the future.  They use prime beef, which is great, but wet-age, which is a less great.  It's priced accordingly (they are, if anything, smart marketers), but given the many options for steak in the Valley, on any given night, I would pick Mastro's or Dominick's for a higher-end steak for a few more bucks.  Am I happy to come back here?  Definitely, it's a solid steak.  Just not a 5-star steak.  As for sides, we have ordered the mushrooms, green beans, french fries, and hasselback potatoes.  All are fine, nothing to write home about.  We did once try a pork belly appetizer which was really quite good, perfect texture.  The sauce was just a tad on the sweet side, but that can be forgiven given the taste of the pork itself.  This place is one of my wife's favorite steak places of all time.  She gives it 5 stars.  I have generally noticed that the women I know like this place more than the guys.  So, if your lady is in the mood for steak, perhaps this is the place to go.",

We were seated well after our 8 pm reservation. Of course on their website they state that if you're 10 minutes late they won't hold your table. It took too long be seated! There was also no waiting area.  The bar also has seating to dine and that was crowded as well.  The website also states that there is a dress code. My boyfriend rushed to get home from work and put on his suit. I also dressed up. I don't know why we wasted our time. There were guys in jeans and some of the women were wearing shorts, one girl was in cut-offs! The restaurant was also incredibly noisy. Thank goodness they seated us in the back where it was much quieter!   I don't know that I'll ever go back because I make a killer filet mignon and use prime beef as well. At least my place is quiet!",

From the moment we walked in it was obvious this establishment was in need of a boost in terms of service. We were seated and our server (Treye) was far less than one would expect, hardly friendly. It was frustrating to watch this same server connect with another couple at a table adjacent to ours in a slightly more positive, definitely more attentive,  manner. Not sure what the difference was but some further training is certainly in order.  Service throughout the visit was certainly lacking. When we left he merely muttered \"thanks again. \" Nobody asked how our experience was or even said goodbye on our way out. Hostess had the same lack luster attitude, not even a greeting. Steaks were good, not great. Truly bummed to not have had the experience we had expected especially on a special day. Unforrunately, huge let down.",

If you know where the bar is set by Mastro's, you can expect the same level or better at Steak 44. You'll get your classic chops with fresh seafood accompanied by top notch service.  After we used the free valet to park, we were seated immediately in the dining area across from the bar. There are multiple dining areas in the restaurant and the area we were in was probably the loudest. The combination of the music and noise from the bar made it hard to focus. I almost had to turn on the sonar to ping my wife across the table because it was also way too dark for my liking.  We spent a pretty penny, but the food was great. Nicole was our server and assisted with everything we needed, including helping us put together our seafood tower of king crab legs and oysters. The 22 oz bone-in ribeye served on a sizzling hot plate was marbled nicely, cooked evenly at the right temperature, and didn't stand a chance with me. My wife also enjoyed her pan seared chicken. The vanilla caramel cake was just what we needed to finish.  The damage came out to a pricey $230 pre tip for my wife and I. I would recommend asking to be sat at one of the remote sections to avoid the noise, but overall a quality steakhouse with fresh seafood in a lively environment.",

We arrived 1/2 hour before our reservation Sunday evening but were seated right away. It was tough to tell how many diners there were because of the maze of tables. There were some tables with up close views of the kitchen, behind glass. Anyway, we were seated at a nice table for two towards the back.   We were greeted right away by our server assistant and then our server, Shawn. Due to numerous food allergies, we didn't order appetizers, so we went right to work on our drinks: wine for her, water for me. They offered four types of water, btw.   For our entrees, my wife got the Chardonnay-Seared Sea Scallops plus steamed spinach while I got the 12 oz. Bone-in Filet Mignon and Sweet Potatoes. Bread was also brought to the table. All in all it came to $135 plus tip.   All of the dishes were exceptional. The scallops were huge (3\" diameter) and the spinach had just the right amount of smoke from bacon to keep it from getting too salty.  My filet was cooked perfectly and had generous seasoning, as good steak should. It wasn't as tender as advertised but the flavor was pronounced, along with a good sear. The sweet potatoes came slow cooked and with a big dollop of marshmallow, melting in.   My wife proclaimed that her scallops were the best she'd ever had. I would agree, since she gave me two of her eight.   Steak 44 is an absolute hot spot for romantic dinner. Oh, and they brought warm cookies with the bill. Nice touch.",

The place is beautiful and all of the staff, especially our waiter Scott, were friendly and helpful. I would strongly recommend the Alaskan King Crab and Rock Shrimp Mac & Cheese and the Effen Cucumber Mule.",

Most restaurants with delectable menus come with tiny portions, but Steak44 left us almost too full for dessert. Almost.....  Quality worth the price tag.",

You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  The new york strip farina style (Egg on Top) was the best most tender melt in your mouth steak I have ever had.  Both appetizers crispy shrimp and the fried deviled eggs were both on point.  Both had an amazing crunch with a little kick on the back end from the sriracha and garlic aioli.  As for the sides the you have to go with the crab and shrimp mac n cheese along with roasted sweet potatoes with bourbon marshmallow top!  If you have enough room in your stomach for dessert and even if you didn't suck it up and get the crispy banana split which the salted caramel gelato - crispy cinnamon sugar banana - luxardo whipped cream is perfection.  Then you must get the beignet tree.  These light fluffy covered in powdered sugar is the best closer to a meal you can get.  So, looking for the best steak in Arizona?  Stop.  You found it at Steak44.  BrandonFitFoodie",

My favorite on the happy hour menu is the shrimp cocktail. Now I'm not talking an ordinary shrimp cocktail! They are the largest freshest \"shrimp steaks\" you have ever seen. I can only eat two but you order how many you want. Two are plenty for one person. The shrimps are served on a separate ice bed and on a separate plate are two sauces; one is a mayonnaise based sauce, and the other is a ketchup based sauce. On the plate is also a substantial amount of fresh horseradish. Warning before you add it to the sauce, fresh horseradish is much hotter.  I love it so I mix the majority of it into the ketchup based sauce.   The shrimp steak I cut into small bites with a knife and fork and enjoy it slowly so I can savor the yummy goodness of the sauce and fresh shrimp.  I pair it with Malbec which marries nicely with the spicy sauce.",

Great food & service. They even called the next day to make sure I had a great experience.  If I had to say anything critical, the tables were very close together along the boothed wall tables & took some serious manipulation to squeeze in & out of.",

    "text": "We came to Steak 44 for a friend's birthday and experienced some \"hits\" but also many misses.  I have eaten at their sister (ok Mother ship) Dominick's in the Scottsdale Quarter and am familiar with the brand.  We had a large party of 22 to celebrate a birthday and it was nice that the restaurant was able to accommodate us.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very intimate and a nice place to bring a date.  We were whisked through the kitchen back to a private(ish) room. I say ish because it was our party of 22 and another party of 10 who were also celebrating a birthday.  While sitting down, the birthday boy clarified with the hostess that we were indeed set up for 22 people and she confirmed yes.  Upon seating, we realized we were only set for 17 and needed to squish together to fit 5 more people.  I at first was a little miffed by my $19 Kettle One on the rocks, but was delivered a shaker that contained more booze so really I got closer to 2 drinks.  The blue cheese stuffed olives were also a nice touch.  My dining companion and I decided to order an appetizer and were not disappointed with the fried deviled eggs.  We ordered the 4, which we perfect to share, but wished we had ordered the 6 instead they were that good.  We also decided to split their special that night, a 22 oz Bone-In Ribeye accompanied with 3 diver scallops in a brown butter and ordered the Dominick's Potatoes and the Brussel Sprout sides.  Here is the problem I have with Dominick's and now Steak 44, I get steak envy.  Other guests who ordered the same exact cut, the same exact temp, often have larger cuts of meat and I end up with the piece the looks like it was the end cap of the cut.  I know steaks can vary due to temp and hand cut steaks at that, but it always seems like I get the hacked piece while my friend's get works of art.  We both enjoyed the cheesy potatoes but the Brussels came up lacking, they should definitely remove the \"get these\" from the dish description.  Here comes more of the \"misses\".  We had two servers for our table, one gave a completely different explanation of the specials than the other (our server said the scallops were cooked with olive oil and S&P while the other mentioned brown butter, two totally different things).  Orders were taken in waves and menus were removed once an order was taken but they still managed to miss 2 of our party who had to flag them down to place their order.  We also had to request bread which is normally brought out before the meal.  Our server was polite enough to let us know he did not charge us gratuity, but pointed out we were charged a 4% administrative fee for the hostesses setting up our table.  Between everyone at the table we paid $80-100 to the hostess for our table to be set up, the table that was set up incorrectly.  Finally, even though we had 2 servers, checks took forever to come out and to be run.  The ambiance was nice but I prefer Dominick's to Steak 44.  The live music at Dominick's is way more appealing than the hits of the 80's, 90's, and Today that was played at Steak 44.  Nothing beats listening to the Boss sing \"Born in the USA\" while you eat a $60 steak.  This review is closer to a 3 star but because I'd rather eat at other locally owned steaks houses instead of Steak 44 it's getting a down grade.  The 2 star review is because of the many misses of the evening, if you want to be 5 stars then experience should seamless.",

    "text": "I've been here numerous times and I don't know why I haven't left a review before.  Each time is always better than the last.  Like I forgot a steak could taste that good until I have it again!   On our last visit we were seated in a quiet back room which was different than previous visits.  It was actually quite nice.  My husband and I started off with a Guinness and a a cocktail with ginger beer I can't remember the name unfortunately.  It was a little strong for me so I switched to a sex on the beach, which was perfect and reminded me of exactly that ;)   We started the meal with the crispy shrimp, every time we order this my husband bites in and just melts over how yummy they are.  I tried to dried deviled eggs which were so yummy.  We continued our food adventure with 2 filets.  His the larger version and mine the petit.  Served along side we ordered mashed potatoes (standard) corn creme brulee which is soooo amazing and delicious and we also had their Mac and cheese!    I love that they bring the steak played out at 500 degrees and then serve the sides right onto the scolding plate.  I am partial to a little crisp edge to everything so it just elevates the meal for me!  The steak has this great buttery flavor and texture that just melts in your mouth with each and every bite!   We ended the meal with a few more beers and cocktails (we were pretty tipsy at this point) in addition to the butter cake which is a staple and a must order for me and the smores in a jar which I didn't even get a bite of because my husband inhaled it within seconds of it hitting the table! All I know is the waiter set it down, lit the marshmallow fluff on fire and its a definite possibility that my husband ate it while it was still flaming! :P   All in all a fabulous meal much enjoyed by 2 parents who don't get a lot of solo time away from the kids!   Well worth getting a babysitter for the evening ;)",

I had the Ribeye and my wife had the filet. Both steaks were really good. Only negative were the steaks had a little less flavor than we had hoped. I believe they said it was \"wet aged\" and not dry aged. So don't know if that brought the flavor down just a bit. But both steaks still tasted very well. That's why we gave 4 stars instead of 5. The Caesars salad was awesome. And the loaded baked potatoes were incredible.",

Scotch and cigars were excellent, it prepared our palettes for great food. We ordered the super colossal shrimp. We live in Tampa, but I've never seen colossal shrimp this big (and tasty). My guest and I ordered steaks. I ordered the ribeye, medium and they slice it before they serve. It was like butter. Some of my guest ordered the Waygu and loved it. We also ordered alaskan king crab with the steaks. Our sides included the creamy mac and cheese with lobster. Along with broccoli. Finally finished it off with desserts that included s'mores and red velvet cream brulee.",

The final touch which really put them over 5 stars is that they called me the next day to ask hoe everything was. Who does that??? Only people who truly care about their customers and reputation.",

    "text": "Myself and a small group of friends celebrated my Pre-birthday dinner at Steak 44 this weekend. Without going into a long song and dance about how fabulous this restaurant experience was, I'll  re-cap my experience as the following (OK, it's going to be a long song and dance ..IJS):   1. Food - I had the Braised bone-in Short Ribs, which is one of my favorite dishes, when I can find it on a menu somewhere I normally order it, the meat was fork splitting tender (no knife needed), had just the right amount of sauce and was prepared spot on. Two of my guest had the 8oz Petite Filet Mignon, one had the crispy shrimp and the other had the prime steakhouse meatloaf, all of these dishes were sampled among the group at my table and were hits - the steak was prepared to perfection and the crispy shrimp (though an appetizer that comes in two sizes) had one of the best sweet thai chilies - garlic aioli sauces drizzled on them, that I've yet to taste anywhere else.    2. Side Dishes - My dinner guest all order a single side each so we had about 5 at our table. The sides that I believe were the best that we had were (in this order): Corn creme brulee - This side reminded me of a combination of  fried corn (my southern folks will know about this) and corn casserole it was baked with a caramelized drizzle of what I think was sugar on top , Dominick's potatoes - I'm normally not a fan of scalloped potatoes, but these potatoes with the combination of Gouda and Mozzarella were just so friggin' delicious, if they added bacon to this dish, I think it would be over the top.  Honorable mentions for side dishes: Baked creamed spinach - it was OK, not one of my favorites, but then again, by the time I got to it the dish was a bit cool, so that may have skewed my likeness of it , the Mac & cheese - was passable, but could have used a little more cheese, next time I think I'll try the Lobster Mac & Cheese. Lastly, Roasted sweet potatoes - were a bit too sweet for my taste, and I love a good sweet potato, but these were not my favorite.  3. Service - The service was excellent, our waitress was very attentive and offered great suggestions regarding the food and wine. Our reservation was made on OpenTable, and I got a call 24 hours prior to confirm my reservation - an actual person left me a voice message! After our dinner the next day an actual person left me another message thanking me for dining at the restaurant. Best service I've gotten in a long time.   I enjoyed my dinner at Steak 44 and would definitely go back again, I mean that Lobster Mac & Cheese is calling my name!   Oh yea, be sure to try the Double Pound Cake for dessert.. Yum to the Tum! I promise.",

We came for happy hour and were happy with the selections on the menu, but the music was so incredibly loud! We asked 4 different people including the hostess and the manager if they could turn the music down. They moved us to a ' quieter' spot in a side room but in fact there was a speaker overhead there too. The service was ok - it fell off as the evening wore on ( And I've had this same server before who wasn't too great then either).  When my 19 yr old daughter arrived, she was shocked at how loud the music was; that's when I knew it wasn't just me ! And - when we left, I walked outside and my ears were ringing. They hurt...as though I had been to a loud concert.  Disappointing experience !   ~ great location, great food, marginal service and marginal atmosphere.",

The food was just ok and the choices were limited. Disappointed the pretzel bread - a Mastros classic - was not served. Lack of entertainment in the bar was another disappointment. Our waitress, Marina, was very attentive and helpful. Unfortunately, mid-way into our meal she announced she was being sent home as it was slow. The waitress who took over wasn't very personable, didn't offer a dessert menu (we had to ask) and we had to flag her down to get her to take our credit card. My husband and I left underwhelmed. Definitely worth the drive to the original Mastros or Dominick's Steakhouse (another Mastros owned restaurant).",

I ordered an NY Strip, Wife order a bone in Filet.  Her steak came out very rare, well they took it back and yep still rare.  They brought out another one perfectly cooked but smaller hmmm.  My NY Strip was a bit to rare but I ate most of it ate around the edges.;  Well the manager insisted on bringing me a new steak, OK great customer service BUT, it was well done and small hmmm.  Manager comped the steaks which was not necessary.  This was a cooks issue not management.  I WILL BE BACK WHY?  BECAUSE THE STEAK WAS GREAT, STEAK SAUCE WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY FABULOUS AND A GREAT MANAGER, I would prefer to eat in one of the forward rooms, I felt a bit claustrophobic in a small room, although it was beautiful and classy.",

    "text": "Excellent food, horrible nightclub-like ambiance  My husband and I took some business associates here on a Saturday night and boy is this place happening.  As in nightclub happening.  The small center has little parking so you are almost forced into Valet parking.  Not a problem, but we immediately felt out of place pulling in behind a Jaguar and in front of a Bentley.  The car parade is typical Scottsdale.  Then there are the patrons getting out of the cars.  Suffice it to say that the women are scantily clad. Definitely not a family restaurant (at least not on a weekend night) but good people watching for sure.  Once inside, loud music and streams of young party goers greeted us.  We were escorted to our table at the back of the restaurant, passing through the kitchen.  I will say, the seafood and dessert displays are amazing.  The restaurant decor is also very modern and nicely appointed. Our table was on the end by the doors to the kitchen so all night long we were blasted with the loud music playing in the kitchen and the rest of the restaurant.  Tables are also seated very close together so when we weren't fighting against the volume of the music, we were having to talk over those seated around us.  At one point we asked one of the hostesses if there was a quieter area and were told there were private booths but they were all booked for the night so they had nothing to offer us.  (Strange since we had asked for a quiet table when we made the reservation. We didn't know about the booths and really wish we had asked for one ahead of time.) I really have no complaints about the food and the service.  Our waiter promptly greeted us and took drink orders.  He really knew the menu. Freshly baked bread was brought out promptly and all of our food was timed nicely. The calamari/shrimp appetizer was tasty. We all ordered steaks and they were cooked to perfection and melt-in-your mouth tender and juicy. For dessert we ordered the beignet tree and vanilla and caramel drizzled cake, both were scrumptious.    Overall, the meal itself was fabulous. Unfortunately the overall experience left us not wanting to return.  For a $100+ per person business meal, I would like to be able to relax and carry on a conversation with the people with whom I'm dining.  The atmosphere here just doesn't lend itself to a nice expensive steak dinner, especially with so many other great choices here in town.",

Sat at the bar, hoping to have a drink and ultimately something to eat because we just came from a conference and were starving.   I live just north of Steak 44, in Paradise Valley and was really hoping to like the place so that it could become a regular go-to destination.   I ended up in embarrassed to take my out-of-town colleagues there. It wasn't as if the bartenders were spending more time with other patrons among the light crowd, they weren't really paying attention to anyone.   Finally, \"What would you like to drink\"? I've never been here before, so how about offering to help me out with the wine selection?  I guess I'll hurry up and choose something since I seem to be imposing.   Likewise, absolutely zero assistance, enthusiasm or even advice about the food menu. I ended up getting the meatloaf with bearnaise on the side (my substitution), which was actually quite tasty.   There are too many other great restaurants in the area to put up with mediocre service. I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.",

I was expecting a quiet modern steakhouse and, well, it is definitely not that. It is very Scottsdale. We showed up for our reservation on time.  The lobby of the place was mobbed and there were three young hostesses facing computer monitors looking a little overwhelmed. I checked in and we went and stood in the corner and waited. The place has a crowded bar with big screen TVs.  Lots of semi drunk bros out on the town.  After a while a hostess came and asked me my name again and walked off. The music was extremely loud like a lot of places in Phoenix.  It was so crowded and uncomfortable I was getting a little put out given I knew I would be spending serious bank on dinner and had expected a stress free time. I went back to said crowded hostess stand to voice my displeasure and we were then seated right away but the reception was not particularly welcoming.  We did get a nice table and the dining room is pretty swanky. I will say once we got seated the acoustics in the place seemed decent as it was possible to hold a conversation over the music. After the rocky start service was generally good. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and delicious. Sides and appetizer were good as well.  Definitely a lively atmosphere. It was my mothers 79th birthday and she loved it which is what counts.  I'll probably be back at some point but be sure you know what you are getting into..it was kind of a raucous scene.  Dinner for two of us was about $300 including a nice bottle of wine.",

From the greeter/hostess to the waiters and waitresses - they were excellent, from start to finish excellent.  Professional, accommodating, friendly and very helpful.  The space - Very Vegas - not necessarily in the best way.  Some beautiful woods, high-end finishes, but Vegas nun the less.  The atmosphere - Lots, and lots of working girls - I love skin but YIKES - being gay I do not want to be someones gynecologist while dining at a fine restaurant.  \"Russian Talent\" was slurred from the table behind us.  Hot pants, tube tops and KMDFMP's are/should not be acceptable dining attire for a restaurant of this perceived quality. There were quite a few professional football players with some coaches and agents.  Lots and lots of plastic surgery - enough that any of the Real House Wives of Beverly Hills would have said \"Wow, she is WAY over done... I need to go there.\"   Food - Meh... I had an unmemorable salad, the prawns were way overcooked and rubbery.  The oysters were really nice and fresh with freshly grated horseradish and nice sauces.  Then... a horrible bone in tenderloin filet.  Supposedly this was a prime cut of beef, but it was neither prime nor tender - I really should have said something then but was so disappointed and starving I just ate it.  No salt and pepper on the steak, the baked potatoes (yes two, assuming they only got small potatoes in so had to make due) looked like they had been sitting out for a week or two and half-heartedly reheated. To be fair all of the other steaks were good to excellent.  But the lobster mash was greasy (not butter greasy) and didn't have salt and pepper.  The highlight was the butter cake with hot strawberry sauce.  Drinks - Really nice wine selection if a bit to heavy on the overrated flashy wines.   The martinis were excellent and good beer choices.  If I could rate the staff they would get 5 stars - unfortunately the food was so hit and miss that I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.",

Every time we have gone there, the appetizers, the entrees, the sides, the wine, the desserts .. all perfect.  No snooty service either.  It's not nestled in the foothills like a few other restaurants in the corner.  For all intents and purposes, it's at the end of a strip mall.  But once you go inside, the ambiance totally envelops you and you feel like you've suddenly walked into a 5-star resort.  It's always packed, but somehow never noisy.  This is the blueprint for other steakhouses to follow.",

Grace, one of the bartenders was truly top notch.  Daniel checked in on us. Not sure if he is an owner or managing partner, but I was very impressed none the less.  We started with deep fried deviled eggs, yum.  Had the wedge, super good.  And moved on to Kansas City and sea bass.  Amazing.  Mac and cheese was perfect.  Sit at the bar and ask for grace. She is awesome!   PS. If you like fireball and Red Bull....they are not snooty!",

Everything was going well until our waitress came to our table. Her name was Ibti. I have over 10 years of restaurant experience and she by far was the WORST waitress I have ever had. She never cracked a smile or made us felt welcome.  It was as if we were bugging her or interrupting her day. Do she realize she works for tips?  We felt she was trying to rush us so she could get another to sit our table. So the worst part was the she forgot to bring our boxed up food so we can take home. We Spent almost $300 and for her to have a attitude and bitch face all night isn't worth it. We called back later about our to go bag but we were almost home and he said \"just tell the manager when we come again\". Really? Ibti needs to find another job that isn't in the restaurant business.",

Nick, our server, was EXCELLENT and so was the rest of the staff...friendly but not intrusive and always available.    We started with a round of cocktails (excellent) and Nick suggested a chilled shellfish appetizer plate. We received a large selection of crab, lobster and jumbo tiger prawns all served over ice with a selection of four sauces.  Fabulous. We then proceeded to the mains with a New York strip (the thickest cut I've ever seen), a filet, salmon and lobster.  Each entree was prepared to perfection and stunningly delicious. We added three sides: Brussels Sprouts (a must), garlic broccoli and lobster mashed potatoes (terrific).  Dessert was a beignet tree. I couldn't find the room to try that but my wife and son said they were excellent. We also enjoyed a nice (affordable) bottle of Merlot with dinner.  It was an overall amazing and very memorable experience. Kudos to the service and kitchen staff. If you go, ask for a booth next to the kitchen if you can.",

    "text": "Best steakhouse in Phoenix. If you're looking for ambiance, great service, a great selection of wines, the best steak, and the best fresh seafood in Phoenix Steak 44 is your place. We started off with the fried deviled eggs and the beet salad. The beet salad was very fresh and delicious and the eggs were unlike anything I've ever eaten before. Both of which I will for sure be getting again. The bread they start you off with is also very delicious, most places usually don't have good bread so that's a huge plus. Then we got the Bristol point oysters. Super fresh. Next we got our steaks. My boyfriend got the bone in filet mignon which was 18oz and I got the wagyu. The wagyu is by far the best steak I've ever had. It was very tender and is worth the price tag it comes with. The filet was tender and had a great chat flavor. Our server Charles let us know and it is very True that they Cook their steaks a temperature under since they are served on hot plates. We both ordered medium and they came out a perfect medium rare. For sides we shared the mushrooms were incredible, the mac and cheese was decent, although I wouldn't order it again, and the chef Watson's potatoes were pretty good. For dessert we got the warm vanilla cake which was okay and the beignets which are off menu, but amazing. Our server Charles was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great recommendations. He provided us with a great service experience and was sure to let us know about everything off menu that was offered. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I took my girlfriend to Steak 44 for a welcome home dinner as she had been away for a week and was really hoping that the restaurant would live up to the reviews I had seen but unfortunately I had a not so great experience.   First the atmosphere was off. They stuck us at a table that had a speaker directly over it blasting all sorts of different music which made it almost impossible to talk without yelling. The restaurant was so dark that multiple people had to use their iphone flash lights to read the menu which is not only annoying, but also distracting when you are getting blinded by another persons flashlight.   The service was a mixture of both good and bad. Our waiter was down right terrible. MY girlfriend and I rarely drink and when we said we wanted just water and a ginger ale his eyes glazed over and he was done with us, you could tell right away. I asked him if there was any specials and he said \"nope, we have our menu.\" Never explained the menu and only stopped by once during our meal to ask us how our food was before we even took a bite. There was a table of 6 next to us who ordered wine and he was more then happy to go over the menu and be polite and attentive. The only thing that helped save the service were the 2 bus boys who kept on top of everything all night and were extremely polite and kind.   Now to the food. I will say this, Steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly, obviously at a steak house that is important. We ordered two apps the pork belly and the meatballs. Meatballs were delicious and a big serving, they were juicy and fried on the outside and the marinara had a good tangy flavor. The pork belly was way over cooked which gave it a hard chewy texture. It was also very lean for pork belly. For sides we got the spinach and brussel sprouts. Spinach was just steamed and unseasoned which is something that could of been done easily at home. The brussel sprouts were okay. They had bits of bacon, drizzled in olive oil, and I believe a little horse radish for a bit of a kick.   Long story short, over priced, food was a mixed bad, terrible service and ambiance. I wouldn't recommend.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here tonight for our 1 yr. wedding anniversary. We haven't had a date night in a while and I am sad to say that steak 44 was a mistake. We chose this over ocean club at city hall because of convenience and I wish we would have driven the extra 10 minutes.   Service was decent, the staff was helpful and attentive until the end. Our food came out quickly and as ordered.  ****I am giving it 2 stars because of our steaks. My husband ordered medium and I ordered medium well - we both had the petit filet. Mine was a little pink but I am over cautious so I ate most of it anyway. My husband however, was eating his steak in the low light and about halfway through we realized that it was basically raw or \"blue\" if you will. He had already eaten some of it and we were both concerned that he may develop food borne illness (picture included). We asked our server and she agreed that the steak was undercooked and whisked it away to be re done. It came back slightly more cooked, the manager walked over and asked if it was okay - no apology. We both lost our appetites and sent the food away unfinished (half finished)- our server didn't even acknowledge it. They offered us a free dessert because it was our anniversary. Then the check was dropped with no indication of trying to right the wrong. My husband called the manager over and explained that his steak was inedible and he regretted eating what he did, he stopped when he realized it was wayyy undercooked and that we would not pay for it. The manager was annoyed. He said okay and walked away and removed it. He did not apologize or attempt to remedy it at all. He kind of acted like we were cheap and we were trying to get free food. I assure you, we were not. We have no issue with paying full price for a nice meal and tipping over 20%. We do so often at other places in the valley. Needless to say we will not be back, our steaks sucked and they did not do anything to make us feel welcome back. I have a picture of the steak to prove it.",

It was salty, sweet, warm, cold, and gooey. So delicious!   Needless to say, he was thoroughly impressed and so was I.

They refilled out drinks, bread and vegetables as we used them. A waiter stood by our table just out of sight. The food was amazing. We chose two glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon($12 each, very good vintage)and it went very well with our meal choices. We were given a free desert for our anniversary. It was a chocolate pudding/cake combo and it was amazing. The bill came to $247.00 and it was worth every penny. I tipped $30.00 and we thanked the staff, then we left. They also own Dominicks Steakhouse in Scottsdale. This will be our next major restaurant review. I don't know if they can top Steak 44. Amazing!!!",

I couldn't of stumbled upon a better choice to have a fancy candle lit dinner with my wife. The service of our waiter Shawn and his Assistant Blake was astounding and top-notch. I ordered the NY Strip medium-well, which I thought was a little bloody for my taste. What redeemed the cook on the steak was that it was served on a sizzling hot plate, so when I cut into the steak, I was able to slightly cook it to my liking. The NY strip was so flavorful, it has my mouth watering thinking of it while I'm writing this! My wife ordered the Filet Mignon and it was delightful and cooked perfectly. The addition of the damp, warm lavender scented towels at the end of the meal really make this whole dinner an experience rather than just a meal. I will definitely be returning here, next time to enjoy the patio with the fireplace.",

The Wagyu had an indefinable sweet crust and beautiful center, again finished exactly as ordered. The wine selection was broad and deep with 1/2 dozen priced more than $1,000. The family that started this restaurant has a terrific reputation in Scottsdale and lived up to it. Don't come expecting an inexpensive meal. Prepare to be wowed and prepare to pay appropriately.",

I let it sit for couple minutes before cutting into it; it was heavenly. I've been on a quest to try the best steakhouses in the valley and I think this steak is the the finest steak I have had, to date.  The seasoning was subtle  yet so flavorful. The baked creamed spinach had just enough cheese and garlic to keep it interesting.  The Caesar salad was good, if a little dry. The poached egg was an interesting touch.   I started with the shrimp cocktail...at the suggestion of Ryan, I only had one, but it was perfect!  Isn't a dry martini a great way to start dinner?

I mentioned it was her birthday in the reservation notes section of their online system.  We arrived about ten minutes late, yet were seated immediately. The place is nicely decorated and has a modernistic style to it. We were sat by a window, and it was a nice table. We were seated at approximately 6:10pm and the restaurant was busy, but not overcrowded. The noise level was faint, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation. This was refreshing since most places seem to be noisy these days.  Our waiter (which I regret not getting his name so that I could mention it here) was very friendly, and joked around with us. He was personable and fun. There were also several \"floaters\" refilling water, taking plates, etc. Everything service was handled efficiently and politely.  We both ordered Petite Filets. We shared the Mashed Potatoes and Mac and Cheese.   The food was excellent, and delivered quickly. Both steaks were prepared properly and quite flavorful. The mashed potatoes were excellent, as was the Mac and Cheese. The serving size was more than we could eat. Overall the food was excellent, and compared to other places I have had similar, the pricing was right on-par.  We were going to order dessert, however the waiter brought out their signature dessert with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate. That was unexpected and quite pleasant. The dessert was Strawberry/Vanilla ice cream on their Butter Cake. It was excellent. I would have gladly paid for it, but they served it free of charge for the occasion.  We both had ice teas, and the total bill excluding tip was ~$107 dollars. I felt this was right in line with the quality of service, food, and experience.   We will definitely return, and were quite pleased with Steak 44.",

I couldn't believe how crowded the bar was, they must have a good happy hour.  It was our anniversary and a lady walked by us and tossed a card on our table which was an anniversary card.  Very nice gesture although the delivery was horrible.  The shrimp cocktail was amazing as was the corn creme brulee.  I had the filet mignon and my husband had the KC strip steak.  Both steaks were good but doesn't compare to City Hall, Capital Grill or Flemings.  We were finished with dinner and had to wait about 20 minutes until our waiter came by to get our food and give us our bill.  Since it was our anniversary they wanted to give us a complimentary desert, which was very nice.  We were so full though so he said he would give us one to go. Our bill was given back to us and he said goodbye.  He never brought us the desert so we decided to leave since we were so full anyways.  About 10 minutes into our drive home they called us to tell us our desert was ready if we wanted to pick it up.  The experience overall was a bit weird and not the level of service we were expecting.",

The food is totally top notch and was by far the best steak and crab I have ever consumed! The only down fall was the table that was next to us were smoking e cigarettes and made a scene the entire time during dinner. Since on the reservation they asked the occasion I would assume they would place us somewhere more private to enjoy the experience. Having an expensive meal tampered by cotton candy smoke and a loud crowd was disappointing. Hopefully in the future Steak44 can band or ask their diners to refrain from smoking inside the dining room! Would highly recommend but be aware of the crowd they let in there!",

The original reservation was for a table in the bar area but we ended up being seated in one of the back dining rooms, which worked out great anyway because it was a little quieter and our evening turned out great regardless. The staff was VERY attentive. Our server was fantastic. We started off with a seafood tower. Biggest shrimp I've ever seen. Pricey but well worth it. Ordered a petite filet for the entree which was cooked perfectly and delicious. Someone ordered a side of fries for the table and they were very over-seasoned so they took them back and didn't charge. All the other sides were yummy. One person in our group spilled red wine on himself and I swear a busser had an opened bottle of soda water on the table within 15 seconds! They even replaced the glass of wine. To end the evening the server brought out complimentary beignets and a couple other desserts! Everyone in our party was very impressed and had a great time.",

The atmosphere of the environment was awesome, the only improvement I could suggest is the valets with their greeting and manner and all that sort but it's a another company/service and not in house. For appetizers, my friend and I had the oysters and lobster combo and the braised pork belly. The seafood was EXCELLENT and pork belly was best thus far. When it came to the steaks I had the filet mignon rare and my partner had the new york, in my opinion again the New York steak was much tastier and THE BEST steak/new york I had ever. Paired with asparagus fries and Brussel sprouts. Have to admit the Brussel sprouts were the only dish I wasn't all over, but that is okay. Drinks/cocktails were on point and that s'mores in a jar, can't go wrong. Price was expensive but you pat for your service. Shout out to our server, Shaun for showing us an amazing experience first time, these guys really show what it's like to be a five star restaurant, from the food runners, bussers etc, hostess to even the manager (had to complement them for their success and my happiness) Shaun even went above and beyond to do some personal favors which was phenomenal and of course took care of him with gratuity as we should all for an excellent course. Thank you Steak 44 for a memorable and FIVE STAR dining experience!",

He was (super cute ;]) very professional and got right down to business, extremely attentive the entire meal. We had the deep fried deviled eggs, NY strip, king crab, and mac and cheese. The deviled eggs were yummy, but very rich. The NY strip was PHENOMENAL. We got it with no fix-ins just pure beefy goodness. The king crab was pretty good. The crab was a little old though. The mac and cheese was absolutely delicious! As for drinks, I had basil limeade and kept 'em coming. The drink is actually huge and packs a whollop. Definitely try it! So, the service is excellent (ask for Travis), the NY Strip is to die for, the king crab is sub par, and I'm assuming all of the sides are delicious. One thing to note: there is a very nice wine list and extensive reserve list, definitely worth checking out). I'm looking forward to coming back. I really want to check out their happy hour!",

Service was some of the slowest I've seen. Just negligent. Server would come back with one beer. Then leave. Then come back and say, \"I'll give you some more time to look over the menu--all this after we'd been at the table for an hour, and that after having been seated 25 minutes after our reservation time. Water and fresh rolls were checked and filled by someone else--he was excellent. Overall we were there three hours. No wonder it's hard to get a table here sometimes. Sides were good. Broccoli was just broccoli, but good. Mac and cheese was fantastic. Veal meatballs appetizer was very good, too...and actually pretty filling. Order it to share! Anyway.

    "text": "Ok... if you don't know better, it is a good restaurant.  Not great, not wow, just ok food. Our steaks were ok, nothing to rave about, served in a burning hot plate that still cooks the steak (does it even make sense? ) and like my better half said,  i do better at home. That says a lot. The potatoes au gratin were undercooked and the mushrooms way too salty. The bread is the same as the one i would find at a Red Lobster or Outback (even if i did not step foot there for more than 10 years) which is a bummer. The service is okay, nothing memorable, nothing to comment on; in short, we would not come back just for the service. We did not order appetizer because we did not feel like it, and they kindly brought dessert when they heard our comments about the potatoes,  sweet, but no thank you; we are not so much into sweets. Instead we ordered espressos, good ones. Aaron at the bar is a Rock Star, fantastic drinks, pure talent, professionalism and personality,  and for this, we will come back. But when we will be craving steaks,  we will go to Donovan's,  because it is sincerely better there, better quality steaks, stellar service, just better. Not so much into Fox concepts,  where design and atmosphere matter more than food and service, Steak 44 fits that same profile. Too bad. Oh well, we tried it, we did not like it that much except the bar. Not a night to remember.",

We also ordered the mac and cheese and crispy asparagus; the mac was good but not outstanding, and the asparagus was crispy-fried heaven.  Service was good despite the restaurant being very crowded - I definitely recommend reservations, even late on a Friday night.",

    "text": "WOW! !! Let me start by saying this post will be long but worth reading.  I don't know where to even begin... If I could give more than five stars I would have. First let me start off with walking up to the restaurant they play great music, love it, don't change your playlist that was just the start to a great dining experience .  Then getting greeted and seated by such amazing friendly staff. Our server Nicole and all the other staff that assisted were above top-notch professional, that were always checking up on us and we're very attentive. I was very impressed when they changed out the table linen from white to black when they noticed we were wearing dark clothes in order to avoid the white linen showing up,very impressive. The manager Daniel came out to greet us, he was very friendly and personable. Now to  the food... beyond amazing! I ordered the Kansas City steak my husband ordered the ribeye. My husband and I make it a point every time we travel to visit a steakhouse this is by far one of the best steakhouses.  We have've gone to many steak houses from New York all the way to California, it's our thing.  I could honestly say I would come back to Phoenix just to visit Steak 44. Just when I thought we were done with a spectacular dinner they treated us with this amazing layout of desserts. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they literally brought me to tears which is a very rare occurrence for me. I was so impressed with how wonderful we have been treated and attention to detail, these people went above and beyond to make this evening so special for us. I am so grateful that we chose Steak 44 for our special dinner.  I thank wholeheartedly all the staff for such a special evening even  to the staff I didn't meet from the chefs in the back and all the other servers who just provided great customer service and thank you Daniel for being such a wonderful manager.  A message to the owners  of Steak 44 you have a very special team working for you. This place is amazing!  Definitely a must when in Phoenix. Xo",

The space is absolutely gorgeous with the Mastro attention to appearance and detail throughout.. a stunning patio and bar area, and the restaurant is divided into many different little \"Areas\" giving a lot of different environments to dine in.. The food: We were some of the first food to be served out of the kitchen as well.. We charged our way though a massive sampling of dishes.. Chilled Seafood, Pork Belly, Ahi Tuna, Bone-in Ribeye, Lobster Tail, Bone-in Filet, Corn Creme Brulee (Too Die For) Au Gratin Potatoes, Mushroom, Scallops, Stuffing, Brussel Sprouts... Every dish was absolutely amazing.. Like they have been serving this food in this  kitchen for years.. Perfect temperatures, great flavors, and ultra premium ingredients. Desserts were playful, and a bit nostalgic.. Smores, Banana Split, Coffee and doughnuts.. The service was some of the best I have received in the Valley.. The server assistants were extremely attentive to table maintenance, Our server AJ was phenominal.. The prices are \"Get what you pay for\"  All in all.. real competition in the Arcadia Biltmore area  for Hillstone, The Henry, and Donovans..",

    "text": "We took our youngest granddaughter to a family dinner at Steak44 as part of her 13th birthday weekend celebration, as she is a steak lover. The complimentary bread in the skillet pans is a nice touch, and the bread was good. Drinks are expensive but there were a few (very few) glasses of wine available for less than $10, and they do have a generous pour. Four of us ordered steaks.  The steaks were all delicious and cooked to perfection: medium rare +.  The side dishes served family style worked well and were tasty. The birthday girl was given a choice of a complimentary dessert, and she chose chocolate cake, which was served with her name on top and a candle.  The piece of cake was large enough it gave all at our table who wanted it a sample and still left her plenty to eat and even take home. The older granddaughter had the s'mores dessert, which was completed with a blow torch. The waitress and other serving staff were superb--friendly and attentive. They took our leftovers to box up to go. One negative is that both my husband and son complained of getting periodic blasts of cold air at their side of the table toward the end of the meal. All in all, we left happy with our experience at Steak 44.  We appreciated the fact we were able to access the menu for the restaurant on the Internet, with prices, ahead of time, so we knew it was going to be pricey. Our bill was in the price range of $$$$ not $$$ which is the price range showing on Yelp.",

First off, I love steak and I'm very picky about my steak being cooked correctly. I ordered the 12 oz New York Strip and it was prepared to perfection! Best steak I have ever had without question. The corn cream brule and brussel sprouts were absolutely delicious as well as the sauteed shrimp we had for an appetizer. Since it was our anniversary we received a free desert which was such a nice touch. We chose the Red Velvet Bread Pudding and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Our server, Jenna, was nice and personable, but over all the service was excellent with so many people coming to check on us. Needless to say, we had a wonderful experience. It was pretty expensive so not a place I would go all of the time, but we will definitely go back for any special occasion. Thanks Steak 44 for making our 1st year anniversary dinner so amazing!",

    "text": "Came here for my aunt and uncle's 50th anniversary dinner party.  We were placed in the kitchen view private room and service was great (with the exception of...read my 2nd paragraph) and food was more than delish!  For appetizer we had crispy shrimp, calamari and meatballs.   Main entree got the filet with creme brulee corn and asparagus. For dessert got the double pound cake with strawberries.  Everything tasted great!  Crispy shrimp was lightly deep fried with sweet chili sauce on top.  Calamari was also lightly deep fried and didn't taste fishy.  Meatball was surprisingly very good and juicy.  I got the filet cooked medium rare and it came out perfect!  This was a big chunk of meat for a filet!  Creme brulee corn tasted more like a dessert!  I wasn't too crazy with the dessert since the pound cake took over the poor strawberries.    Only reason I gave it a 4 star was because my cousin had asked for a wine list and they gave him the expensive list.   He thought that this was the only list they had and had spent $200 on a bottle that typically cost about $60.  We later found out there was a cheaper wine list out there!   I dunno but felt like the waiter did this on purpose to cheat us.  Why can't you place all wine on 1 menu rather than 2?  I thought this was a bit shady but then again we could've asked if there was a cheaper wine list.",

We tried it because it is a Dominicks resturuant,  but this place is so far below Dominic's,  I can see why they have used an alias - Steak 44  From the get go I was displeased. Since I use handicap parking, I was more than upset to see Paid Valet parking was using handicap slots to swap out cars. I bad to drive to the back lot & hobble in from there.  Then they tried to seat us at a table that was like being seated on the 101. Traffic congests there & no privacy. We demanded to be moved.  After us they tried to dump this table on 5 other couples within a hour. Finally a young couple who doesn't know better stayed.   The food was good,  but no where like Dominic's.   What you have here is a HIGH priced pick up bar, where if you're hungry, they'll feed you.  I don't know who the designer was, but whomever it us should be FIRED!!",

The reason a group gathers for dinner is for CONVERSATION...not loud music.  This spoiled our time together.  We asked if they would turn it down and it never happened. - there was little to no selection of healthy nutritious food!  Everything was laden with saturated fat.  Cream and butter on everything. - The one salad that was recommended - the Chop - had wilted iceberg lettuce cut into 1/4\" pieces.  It was not a crispy 'raw' salad.  Disappointing for someone who doesn't eat animal protein and just wanted a healthy salad. - The PRICES!!! Yikes!  This dinner for 6 was close to $1000.  Everything was a la carte which made for an extremely expensive meal for one if you wanted anything other than just meat. We dine out regularly and hit fav's like Hillstone, Henry, Tarbells, etc, but will NEVER go here again.  This place will surely go out of business with this menu, prices and loud ambiance. The wave of now is based on the latest scientific information about the best diet for human beings and it is nothing that was served here.",

We arrived prior to 6pm without a reservation as we wanted to experience the bar which is open seating. I was impressed. This place is top notch in every way possible. Our bartender was professional, polite and made us feel welcomed. I had 2 Maker's Mark cocktails (early bar menu special) and they were deliciously strong. The crispy shrimp and steak with fries we ordered were perfect and just the right portion size, also from the early bar menu. I was given a special birthday dessert, but after 2 strong cocktails and our small bites I was happily satisfied and could not eat another bite. I look forward to making a reservation for dinner soon. They have a few tables that are semi-private and in close proximity to the kitchen, that's where I want to be during our next visit. Spectacular place, outstanding service, well crafted cocktails and delicious food how can you not love it?!?

The night started off slow but got increasingly busier as the night progressed . Sitting at the bar gives you a birds eye view of everything happening around and believe me there was a lot to see. My friend and I shared a lobster grilled cheese sandwich and some braised pork belly. Sweet baby Jesus both were delicious. The guy sitting next to me ordered a steak and I swear I wanted to ask him for a bite because it looked and smelled amazing. The entire staff was very attentive which was nice considering how busy this place got.

    "text": "I dined here on Saturday night (3/26/16) with my best friend who was visiting from out of town.  It was my first time here and was very excited to try a something new.  Before I get into my review, please note that I am very \"meat-centric\" when it comes to steakhouses so my criticisms will land mainly on that subject.  First, it was very busy and the place was definitely buzzing.  You sensed that this was the hot new spot in town and people seemed to be enjoying the atmosphere.  We were greeted at the hostess stand and were promptly taken to our table.  Our server was very attentive and knew the menu well.  However, we did have to ask for the music to be turned down because it was so loud that our server was yelling just so we could hear him.  We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, a side dish, and our steaks.  Everything came out in a timely manner.  In general, the service was good.  So now, time for my nitpicks.  When my steak came out, I cut into it to make sure it was cooked to my liking (i.e., medium rare) only to find that it was totally raw inside.  I told the server and they fixed the problem.  The steaks are served on a hot platter swimming in sizzling butter.  I know there are many people who like this, but I personally find this to be a detriment and an interference to the meat's natural flavor.  Also, I found that my steak was overly seasoned.  So every bite of my bone-in rib eye was dominated by butter and salt.  There was no room for the natural beef flavor to come through.  I believe that if you have high quality ingredients, such as prime aged beef, then there should be very little in between the beef and my taste buds or at least a proper balance of flavors.  On the other hand, I had a bite of my friend's New York Strip and that was very tasty and had better flavor balancing.  So, to you meat purists out there trying to decide if you want to give Steak 44 a shot, I would say go for atmosphere and the \"scene\", but be wary about which cut of meat you order.  My rib-eye, which is already a fattier cut of meat, did not fare well as presented.  Maybe a leaner cut of meat will serve your taste buds better.  Overall, the total experience was just OK for me.  I have been to many steakhouses in my time so my standards have been raised quite high.  I wish I could've been blown away by the steak but unfortunately I'm left wanting more.",

    "text": "Steak 44 has outstanding steaks and sides. My husband and I went to celebrate our son's birthday together with our children on a Friday evening. We had made reservations and our party was seated at that time. We started our meal with the appetizer of the giant prawns. Fresh and delicious shrimp served with a homemade tartar sauce that had a very pleasant and tasty kick to it. Each one of us ordered a different steak from the ribeye to the filets. We ordered our steaks from rare to medium well. Steak 44 does cooked there meat to perfection. No steak sauce needed, the meat was very flavorful.  We decided to share some of the sides and not one of us were disappointed. The brussel sprouts,  chefs potato ( which is their scalloped potato ) and the lobster mac and cheese were wonderfully pre paired. We all agreed our favorite palate pleasing event was when we tasted their out of this world cream corn dish. Although the corn was meant to be savoury it was almost like a yummy dessert. We ended our meal with a tree of beignets served along with three different yummy dips. This was my third time eating at Steak 44. I've enjoyed each and every time I have ate at this restaurant. Well done steak 44.",

Everything about this place was AMAZING, but especially the service. I liked being able to make a reservation on Open Table for a reasonable time, and when we arrived, they had our table ready within just a couple of minutes (although they were obviously busy). It was cool being walked through the kitchen to a smaller room where we were seated. Our waiter and his assistant were both great, and when my friend mentioned that his steak looked slightly overcooked, they went ABOVE and BEYOND without the slightest hesitation to quickly get him another one, complete with new sides. The manager came over to show his concern, and although not necessary, they brought us the most amazing beignet dessert at the end (not to mention removing the cost of said steak from the bill, which was unnecessarily generous). The food was all great, and I cannot say enough positive things about our experience at Steak 44 -- we will most definitely be back as soon as we can.",

You can't go wrong ordering any of those items. Also their bread is unreal.   The service here was absolutely jaw dropping in terms of how fantastic it was. I've eaten at some of the best steakhouses in New York and have never been treated with even remotely the same level of service as I experienced at Steak 44. The waiters, managers, and serving assistants were wonderful - polite, attentive, and not at all pushy. The last time I had this level of service was when we dined at Eleven Madison Park - we're talking three Michelin caliber service here.  I would not hesitate for a second before recommending Steak 44 to a friend.",

They execute absolutely everything well, from the moment you arrive until you exit the restaurant. It's modern and sleek inside with an open kitchen. There are a few tables with glass windows that allow you to view the entire line while you dine. You can request these tables in advance, and it's amazing. They also have a great raw bar as you enter the restaurant.  Service is top notch. There are a good 3-4 waiters per table. Our waitress was still in training, yet she was probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had. She knew the menu extremely well and coursed everything appropriately.  The fresh baked garlic Parmesan and sea salt bread is amazing. It comes out piping hot in a skillet and is so rich. I could be happy with a few baskets of this and call it a night.  The pork belly appetizer was excellent, seasoned with Asian sauces and tender like butter.  The truffle baked potato and mushroom blend were excellent as well. But the star of the show was he Steak. A perfect 22 ounce bone in ribeye medium rare and charred. As a steak expert, I do not say this lightly...the best ribeye I've ever eaten. Better than Peter Luger. It cut like butter, I barely needed a steak knife. The fat was rendered perfectly.  For dessert, do not leave here without trying their legendary beignet tree. Served with creme anglaise and Nutella sauce.",

While the steaks are delicious and were prepared perfectly, the toppings I was not too fond of. The husband got lobster and for $44, you'd expect a whole tale. But this was the biggest disappointment of the nights. It was a few small chunks. I literally thought they forgot to bring out the lobster when I realized the tiny chunks were it. I got a crab cake oscar andthe crab cake doesn't go well on the steak in my opinion. Independently yes. I love crab cake but the fishiness of the crab masks the taste of steak. I would love something like pure crab meat that I could dip in butter. The hassleback potatoes that everyone raves about are just very greasy, deep fried potatoes that melt like mashed potatoes in your mouth. The server said the brussel sprouts are a huge hit but it wasn't anything I couldn't cut and prepare at home myself. The crispy shrimp was amazing. A hint of buffalo and creamy sriracha like sauce that was tender inside and perfect crunch outside. We ended up spending over $300 and it was a tiny bit disappointing. I would consider visiting again and trying different things.",

    "text": "So the upscale suburban super trendy steakhouse is not really my scene but was invited by a local and wasn't about to argue - walking in my concerns seemed well founded - not that Steak 44 doesn't look nice - it looks great but the high energy loud (like really loud) next to the bar high top seating seemed to confirm my assessment  that Steak 44 is a bad rift on Ruth's Chris - I could not have been more wrong.  Now Steak 44 - especially if you sit next to the bar - is loud and our very nice waitress even commented that hearing orders can be tough but that's the scene and if you not down with it go somewhere else - again not my fave but after a few minutes you settle in for the experience.  The service was great with the small exception of losing our waitress for a bit after we had ordered appetizers and we didn't order dinner for at least an hour after we sat down - wasn't really an issue but it did make for a three hour dinner.  Steak 44 has daunting selection of cocktails - my wife went with the Basil Cucumber Limeade at the suggestion of our server and said it was very nice - I a short but effective selection of beers kept me happy.  Prior to ordering apps a skillet of fresh baked rolls was delivered to the table and I began to get the idea that Steak 44 was cut from a different cloth - elevating a simple dinner roll is a great sign and I could have consumed the entire skillet full of these buttery soft yeasty rounds of bready goodness and yes I added even more butter.  We listened to our server on the starters and again not disappointed - the Fresh Burrata was four (i think) balls of the silky soft mozzarella relative with a just firm shell encasing the smooth creamy interior cheese and with just a touch of the tomato jam it was a great start to the meal - only critique would be the crackers served with (while good on their own) didn't hold up to the spread of the cheese - maybe something with more body - but I would total get the app again.  Also ordered the Shrimp - four perfect shrimps were very good but the make your own cocktail sauce pushed them over the top - my friend didn't warn me - which was fine and funny - but know that the horseradish (was it Atomic??) will absolutely light you up - in a good way.  In addition to the steaks you would suspect - Steak 44 offers a  large array of seafood and that was my direction until I was advised to not overthink this (I do) and go with the steak and while I am sure the seafood is outstanding after eating the steak I can not argue.  I went petite filet while my wife tried the New York Strip and I would highly recommend both - charred, medium rare - delivered with a warm red center exactly as order on a smoking hot plate - both were basically carnivore perfection.  I supposed people order the \"regular\" size but honestly the 12 oz strip and 8 oz. filet were plenty especially given the sides. And about the sides - remember when I mentioned elevating over that standard - that was all three - a creamy spinach that feature three (seriously three) cheeses and Watson Potatoes with more cheeses in little square of potato heaven and Shishito Peppers that were blistered with sea salt and parm - you could make a fantastic meal out of their sides.  So we were completely stuffed - the apps, the steaks, the sides so of course we order dessert.  If you go to Steak 44 and do not get the Ultimate Warm Vanilla Caramel Cake you have erred in the most egregious manner - it is a decadent combination of cake served warm in its own little crock aside a mountain of airy (almost whipped cream) gelato - once combined it brought tears of dessert happiness to my eyes (pro tip - bourbon neat makes it even better).  So walked in dubious - left super impressed - services was great and while not cheap (especially the drink prices) the value seems commiserate with the quality of the experience.",

I haven't been for close to a year so I don't know if this bad experience was a one time thing or there has been a monumental shift in the restaurant. It started bad with the watered down drinks then continued with the stagnant shrimp and tough overcooked steak.  I was embarrassed because I exclaimed the greatness of this place to my guest who was treating as this was a special occasion. After the dinner we talked about the experience and I genuinely felt bad because as you all know it's very expensive and I chose the spot. I will have to think long and hard about returning as the whole experience (and food) left a bad taste in my mouth. I wish I had my phone to show pictures of the food they looked as unappetizing as they tasted.  Whatever has changed here I surely hope they change it back to the way it was because justifying a few hundred dollar meal is very hard to do with this recent memory standing out in my head.",

The Filet 12oz was cook to perfection and side dishes were off the chart. The Sea Bass was the best I have ever tasted.... finally the dessert was worth waiting for. I can't remember the name , but it had ice cream, cake, caramel and nuts. So if you are looking for a place to go for that special occasion try Steak 44 You will not be disappointed!",

Now onto the food, with the exception of the crispy shrimp (delicious) the food was average, I had the bone in rib eye and it was something I would expect from a lesser steak house. If looking for an amazing steak I would suggest Arrowhead Grill in Peoria or Preston's in Scottsdale not only are they amazing but come in slightly cheaper than Steak 44.",

I was blown away by the ambiance. The restaurant was nice looking and seemed like they are always packed. The only complaint was it was too loud I could barely hear my husband talking. But I sure heard everyone else's conversation.  Hearing him didn't matter after we got our food :)     The food was amazing! I started with the chopped salad. It had artichoke - roasted red peppers - red onion - locally grown iceberg + romaine - parmesan (minus no parmesan and red onions) so delicious. Husband got the Super Food salad with baby arugula + kale - sriracha sunflower seeds - seasonal berries - goat cheese - champagne fig dressing.  I got the bone in ribeye and husband got the filet mignon.  Holy deliciousness! I have never been in love with a steak before and we go to a lot of Steakhouses because the husband loves them. We should have just ordered steak. We got pretty full. But... I'm not leaving out the best dessert and we got the red velvet bread pudding made with white chocolate - sweet cream cheese - vanilla gelato... OH MY GOODNESS :)    Our server was Megan and she was pretty awesome. We will be coming back once we save up some funds JK lol. It is to be expected to be crazy expensive. But worth it!!!!",

We were all so impressed by our wonderful dinner.   We stared with the crispy shrimp. A touch of heat, crispy, tender shrimp with a sweet glaze. So good.   Their bread is super yummy. Soft, with crispy exterior with a nice yeast flavor.   We all had steak and shared our sides. Each steak was cooked to perfection.   My wife and I had NY strip. Perfectly cooked at med rare. Just melt in your mouth goodness with super beef flavor you don't get with a filet.   Our friend got the wagyu which he was very impressed with. He said it was as good or better then most steaks he's ever had.  We shared sweet corn, Creme Brulee corn, Hasselback potatoes, mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms. Wow all were so good.   We don't drink, but I know they have one of the best wine selections in the valley.   Service was world class. Not one mistake was made. The bathrooms were spotless. Wow what a great time. I really can't wait to come back.   Service 5/5. Food 5/5.",

I love the artistry of watching bar tenders making there job an art. I can say this is True for steak 44.  Also at the bar you can sneak a peak at everyone elses plates. Now the name us steak 44 what I saw on peoples plates looked amazing. I'm not a steak person but seafood lovers have nothing to worry about the seafood choice is top of the line, sea bass,  scallops, salmon you will be fine. It's not cheap or moderate expect to pay top dollar but your getting top service and food. I'll be back hopefully remember to take the photo before I indulge.",

Steakhouse 44 just surpassed our previous favorite, Quality Meats, in Manhattan. Why? Every aspect of our dining experience was exceptional.  Our server, Jessica, provided excellent menu advice and delivered attentive, personal service, a True professional.   My husband ordered oysters, both West Coast and East Coast, and declared them the freshest oysters he has ever had. The fried deviled eggs were amazing. Trust me. Just try them.   Steaks? Incredible. We had the NY strip, petit filet, and Kansas City bone in strip.   Side dishes were generous portions to share with your companions like I expect from steakhouses. These side dishes stood out for their unique preparation and every single one was delectable. No duds. Mac and cheese, mushrooms, hasselback potatoes, double baked truffle potato.   Dessert, because why not? The vanilla cake and chocolate chip bread pudding were perfect.   Lastly, amazing wine list and my husband had 3 different unique old fashioneds - his favorite had walnut bitters. Yum.   You must try Steakhouse 44. It is worth the expense. It is an experience you will always savor.",

We had reservations for 5:15, and when we walked in at 5:10 we were immediately seated and met our server, Scott. He continued to give us extraordinary service all night.  For appetizers, we shared the buttered rolls that were included with the meal, as well as oysters and beet salad. We also shared a bottle of Merlot recommended by Scott, and it was excellent.  My main course was the Shetland Island braised salmon. Wow. Perfection. Along with that, I enjoyed the shared sides of mushrooms and Brussels sprouts. The thick-cut bacon with the Brussels sprouts was the real wow factor there! My 12-year-old son was quite happy with a side of macaroni and cheese (I'd love to know where the noodles come from!) and some fries. My husband rated his steak as among the best he has ever had.  Even though we were all about to explode from good food at that point, we had to share a dessert. My husband was kind enough to go with my preference off the dessert list: brioche and chocolate chip bread pudding.  This is up there with the best bread puddings I have ever had. The brioche had a wonderful texture and stayed in lovely big chunks. The top was kind of caramelized in a glorious way in addition to a drizzle of sea salt caramel, and there was a generous amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips (high quality, by the taste) throughout. A big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream topped it off. Thank goodness we were sharing that among four adults!  Steak 44 was a five-star experience in every way.",

Dining in many places around the world and even back home, the food was delicious. (And John's dirty martinis... perfection). Would *highly* recommend this place.

We went for our 29th anniversary and our server was very sweet and helpful so she suggested the special which was a wagu steak which was large enough to split. Normally my husband's go to steak is the Kansas City strip but we decided to go with the wagu instead. When our waitress checked on us she was shocked to hear that my husband was disappointed in the steak having too much grizzle and not as much flavor as the Kansas City. Of course she and even the manager offered to replace our order with something different but we had eaten most of it at that point so we said we were happy and there no need for a change. Our side was the Brussels sprouts which is one of our favorites with crispy bacon pieces. For dessert we were offered a second dessert since they were going to give us a complimentary anniversary dessert anyway. We were served the warm vanilla caramel cake which is so delicious; it is a soft warm butter cake with warm caramel drizzled on top and candied pecans with a side of their awesome homemade whipped cream and we took the second one home to my mom.  When we received our bill not only had they given us the two complimentary desserts but they also didn't charge us for the steak which was very surprising to us. We will definitely be back.",

The clientele was lively and so were the bartenders and I enjoyed a very generously portioned martini that was perfectly shaken and not stirred ;). We had appetizers and salads and steaks for entrees and everything was absolutely perfect. We over-ordered so did not have room for dessert (could have been the gorging ourselves on the incredible parker house rolls!), so that's a good excuse to come back on our next visit.

Ordered two steaks with a side of the truffle butter (an absolute MUST!), the creamy macaroni and cheese (I could have licked the plate clean,) and the crispy potatoes which were also delicious but unnecessary given that we were stuffed by that point.   Two reasons why I had to give the restaurant 3 stars. First, my filet was overcooked. Something I did not expect for a $50 steak. Second, a warning/reminder when the sizzling hot plates arrive would be great. My husband got butter splashed all over his shirt and we had to take it to the dry cleaner the next morning.   Our server was awesome and made some great recommendations. Despite a few speed bumps, I would give this restaurant another chance.",

We were congratulated on our anniversary by everyone we talked to at the restaurant. It was like they cared. They showed great hospitality. Our waiter had great knowledge of the menu. The food was amazing. I had the lamb chops, baked potatoes and spinach. My girlfriend had the NY Strip and mac and cheese. The portions were huge. We had enough food to take home for another meal which is not usually the case when going to restaurants like this. We enjoyed every bite and the meats were cooked to perfection. We are definitely considering making this our permanent anniversary spot. Definitely the Number 1 steakhouse in Phoenix",

I'm impressed that they left me a voice message the day after thanking me for coming in with my group.  That's the first from a fine steakhouse!   I had the staff recommend a wine for me that wasn't Napa county since it's close to me, a sweet Pinot and it had to have a cork for me to keep!  They have a variety of wine that starts from the fifties to a grand.  A grand - I was surprised. They met all that criteria I wanted from my wine after some thought and time.    The Wagyu Filet was the best filet that I have ever had that was a wagyu steak!  Medium rare is how it is done my way!  Always!  Superb taste.  Add on the side tasty potato and call it a fulfilling, treasured meal!  They tossed in cookies for the complimentary end.    I had a fine dining time here!    Cheers!",

The 5 of us still haven't stopped talking about our experience. And the food.... Sooooooo soooooo sooooo good. Started with crispy shrimp deviled eggs. Oh yum! Steaks melt in our mouth.

My plan was to have a nice meal and cocktail at the bar as a solo diner, similar to my experiences at Mastro's or Dominick's. This was definitely on a different experience.   A noisy and busy is not an issue for me. I usually enjoy a popular location and lively crowd, which was my experience with this place. However, the only seat open was next to the service well and the bartender encouraged me to see there.  I felt waaay too close to the open fruit/garnish selections at the well. Also, the printer was right in front of me, to the point of the paper orders spilling out to my eating area. Then, the trash was replaced by an employee and placed right up against my right leg. Ya know, touching me. A garage can.   The bartenders were busy but not overloaded. They look their time to get to me and take my order. I had to ask for the cocktail and then a food menu, as they were not offered. I ordered a pomegranate martini and it was basically juice. I planned to eat but there just wasn't enough room and I wasn't experiencing great service. I decided to take my business elsewhere.  Maybe this place is better in the dining room but I'm not about to expose my future guests to subpar service.",

(Camelback/Arcadia)  I've been here three times for various events and the service and food has always been spot on. It's a bit on the pricier end but Steak 44 is worth it.  My most recent trip opened up with the crispy shrimp, superfood salad and fresh burrata appetizers. The crispy shrimp I would have ordered as an entree elsewhere; perfectly fried and tossed with just the right amount of sauce. The superfood salad I thought was ordinary but nevertheless tasty. There's lot of salad and the presentation could have been better. Burrata was a heavenly bite of of crouton, pickled onion and fresh cheese.  Petite filet mignon was simply stunning! Perfectly flavored and melts in your mouth. Sugar snap peas were cooked perfectly. Chef Watson's potatoes were a bit on the heavy side but decadent.  The meal finished off with the ultimate vanilla caramel cake. Easily could have fed two people and the gelato and cake paired nicely.     The bartending staff has been there as a unit since Steak 44 has opened in 2014 and they are easily one of the friendliest and professional staff I've ever met in the industry. They'll take care of you and make great stiff drinks. (Shoutout to Lauren & Connor for becoming my friends that evening!)  If you like Steak, you'll like Steak 44.",

Last night was quite a disappointment.. we were a party of 6 and was seated in a partial booth meant for a party of 4. Since it was so tight when the drinks came, the waiter spilt the olives and olive juice of a martini on me. Fortunately I was wearing a black dress! They came out with club soda and cloth napkins but we had to ask for a towel with water to get the stickiness off.   I understand that mistakes happen.. but we were hoping for some sort of reimbursement with the check. Whether it was my drink paid for or maybe a free desert, even an apology from the manager would've been nice... I expected more for an establishment Steak 44 claims itself to be.",

    "text": "My friend found this place on Yelp on a whim and BOY am I glad to have come here to celebrate my 25th birthday. It's definitely a $$$ spot, but you're getting premium cuts of steaks, chops, fresh seafood and delicious sides, so for special occassions, it's most definitely worthwhile. Come with a stacked wallet and an empty stomach!  I'm from California and I've had my share of steakhouses in the Bay Area, but never have I ever had steak that tasted SO GOOD in my life!!! It's unbelievable how awesome Steak 44 is, I really want to come back to Arizona and eat all of this delicious food over again!   All of their food was mouthwatering, and I mean everything was just cooked perfectly and deliciously seasoned. Here's the breakdown of the good good:  Steak: I tried three cuts while I was here because my friends and I sampled each other's food. By far, my favorite is definitely the rib eye. Rib eye is more on the fatty side. When it's cooked with the bone, it is extremely flavorful, fatty and tender. The meat really should be enjoyed rare to medium rare, there's no better way to eat it. Second favorite of mine has to be the filet mignon. You can't go wrong with that cut. It's less fatty than the ribeye but it's very tender as well. The New York Strip was the last one I tried. Of the three, it was my third favorite. Don't get me wrong, it was all REALLY GOOD. I mean you're getting high quality beef for a great price and many different cuts, I can't complain about any of it!!   Add-ons: Add different types of butter to the top of your steak for MAXIMUM flavor! There's truffle butter (damnit Nicki Minaj, had to go and ruin this for everyone), blue cheese, and black truffle green pepperorn. You can make it a full on surf-and-turf dinner by including lobster tail for $38, crab cakes for $16. For fancier people, $18 for that foie gras. Didn't get to try the add-ons but if I'm looking to go all out next time, you'll definitely catch me on that fancier side.   Seafood: Oysters available on the half shell - Blue Points, Kumamotos and the Kusshis. Blue Point Oysters are probably the bigger ones of the three. $4 each and its serve with mignonette, horseradish, cocktail sauce and not quite sure what the last one was. Comes with minature tabasco sauces, so cute!  Appetizers: Braised pork belly was one of my ultimate favorites of the night. Glazed with honey and chili, the pork belly was sweet and juicy. And the bed of spinach below absorbed all that wonderful flavor, it was a hefty bite no doubt.   Sides:  Mac and Cheese - I could eat this easily on its own! I like my Mac and Cheese chunky and not watery so this is cheesy melted perfection.  Creamed Spinach - you really can't enjoy steak without a large fill of creamy and rich spinach. Crispy Hassleback Potato - I mean, to be able to get crispy edges and keep the middle soft and cooked perfectly? TEACH ME YOUR WAYS!!! Roasted Brussels Sprouts - mmmmmmmm bacon and brussel sprouts has to be the most perfect pairing in the whole world.  Creme Brulee Corn - THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Creamy corn with a little sugary crust, torched beautifully so the sugar hardens, I can even.....  I left the restaurant smiling and ultimately satisfied. Had to take a lot of the food home because I was simply stuffed to the max. This was one of the best meals I've had and my friends and I each stared at each other in disbelief while we ate the delicious food. Looking forward to the next time I'm in Arizona again!!",

    "text": "Steak 44 is an upscale American Steakhouse. My review is only for for the 4-6pm early Happy Hour at the bar.  As we entered the valet ran to the door to open it for us. We were quickly greeted and we grabbed seats at the bar. The bartender was very welcoming and we started with Happy Hour Priced Wines ($8.00) that were large pours. We split a BLT Wedge Salad ($12.00) and the smaller order of Panko Crusted Deviled Eggs ($8.00). Soon someone drops off a big skillet of Hot Steamy Parmesan Herbed Rolls (6 rolls) to us....Then the salad and eggs arrive with a change of silverware. The salad was rich creamy and very satisfying and the chilled silverware made it seem more special. The eggs were tasty and seemed free of oil and were rich and creamy inside. It seemed weird to dip them in Sriracha Aioli but they were even tastier after that. By the time we had 1/2 salad, 1/2 the deviled eggs and a roll each we almost didn't need dinner. But we came here for the $10.00 Filet Mignon with Parmesan Truffle Fries. (silverware is changed again) Soon our steaks arrive. It's a just perfect size for us....looks like 4oz...that is how much steak I would eat at home and I also have enough to save a few bites for my dogs. I thought my steak leaned more towards medium rare than the medium I asked for but accepted it anyway. It was delicious, flavorful and tender like butter. The fries were light with a thin crisp exterior and a fluffy middle and were nicely seasoned.   I felt 5 star satisfied.  The $10.00 Filet Mignon with Truffle Parmesan Fries at Steak 44 is (or was) one of the best kept secrets in Metro Phoenix.",

    "text": "I don't even know where to begin with this review! Our Steak 44 experience was literally off of the charts. Pricey, but worth it. I made my reservation online and mentioned that we were celebrating my fiance's new job in the notes. We had barely even gotten through the door before they said CONGRATS and welcomed us with big smiles! He was so happy!   We got there a little early so that we could partake in their Happy Hour drinks + eats in the bar before dinner. Their martinis are delicious and they give you the shaker so it really ends up being almost 2 drinks! We had their giant shrimp {pricey but oh so good!} and their king crab and avocado stack - holy YUM!   For dinner, the service was exceptional. EVERYONE in the restaurant knew our names. I literally got up to go to the restroom and slightly bumped into one of the servers {not our server} and he kindly said \"oh, i'm sorry Hailey!\". I thought to myself, how does HE know my name?! Now that is world-class, folks! Ok, ok, enough about the service -THE FOOD! We ordered an inexpensive bottle of wine to start {~$35} and then their beet salad and chopped salad; oh my goodness, the beet salad was divine. They definitely go heavy on the beets, which we love!! For dinner we split the scallops and a NY strip steak - both literally melted in our mouths. I highly recommend doing this! For sides, we had their truffle double baked potato and the shishito peppers. The potato was so rich and creamy that we each only had 1/4 of it, leaving 1/2 to take home! The peppers were incredible, with the perfect amount of kick.   THEN, since we were celebrating Ben's new job, they brought out not 1, but 2 heavenly desserts! We came home with multiple to-go bags but they made for another great dinner at home! Thank you so much for the world-class experience, Steak 44! You are our new go-to celebration spot! Whether you are looking to impress clients, celebrate something special, or just spoil yourself - Steak 44 is a must.",

    "text": "Came here with a larger group Friday night. The restaurant is beautiful, the staff was amazing, and the wonderful taste of the food still sits on my tongue.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share for the table, including meatballs, calamari, and, my favorite, the seafood tower. It's rare to get this quality of sea food in Phoenix. I then had the meatloaf afterwards and savored every single bite. Perhaps it was my misunderstanding, but I was a bit disappointed that it was a la carte and didn't come with a single thing on the side.  The only reason I can't award 5 stars right now is because of the initial seating experience. As the first in my group to arrive with a reservation, I was told I was the first one to check in and that's it - no indication of how long I'd have to wait, whether we needed our whole party to sit, etc. Instead, I just stood around waiting. When the entire party showed up, we were finally given some attention and offered 2 circular tables pushed together in the bar area or our reserved group of 8. I would have hoped for more for a larger party that had made a reservation and was sat a good 15 minutes after the reservation time.  That said, the experience afterwards was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back again soon and hope to award the final star!",

The Host, Brett, was so accommodating to us and where we wanted to be seated.  Once seated our server immediately came over to us and asked us if we would like to look at a wine list or drink menu.  We decided on a nice bottle of Amarone and she didn't waste any time in bringing it to us.  We started with the Deviled Eggs with crispy shrimp (Ocean 44 also has them on their menu....another 5 star restaurant) and the Heirloom Tomato Salad with Feta cheese.  Only one word to describe both, \"DELICIOUS \"!!! Oh and speaking of delicious their bread is off the charts!  We both had filet mignon 8oz for me and 12oz for my husband. They bring it out on a plate that is sizzling hot!  Both steaks were cooked to perfection.  Our sides were broccoli and yummy wild mushrooms.  From the ambiance to the service and quality of food this place is at the top of the list.  Don't even waste your time at Mastro's City Hall originally founded and opened by the Mastro Family but now owned by Landry's.  Go directly to Steak 44!!!",

Once we got inside, we were seated almost immediately and our hostess was very nice and sweet to get us a private booth for the night and we had this amazing view of the kitchen. Once we got seated it just kind of got awkward from there, our waiter came off the wrong way with us, I think he might have even mumbled something derogatory towards my wife. Never once did he smile, but he did get the job done, for that I will commend him for living his shallow, dull life style. Other than that, my steak came in sizzling and was cooked to perfection, I absolutely have no complaints about the food as it was perfect to my liking. Once we finished the night we left, and everyone was literally lining up to thank us and to have a good night. I'd totally be back, if I got a different waiter/waitress.",

This is always a go to place for business dinners and service in the past has always been spot on. 5 of us in our group tonight - all 5 ordered steak. Asked for medium plus on my bone in ribeye. Mine came out completely raw in the middle. Spoke with my waiter he says \"let me look back to see how you wanted it cooked.\" I said I did not order a raw steak. It was rushed back to the kitchen to be reheated and the manager brought over a clean plate so that I could dine of the sides that we ordered. Waiter came back and did apologize and agreed the steak was raw. A free dessert was brought out as a sorry.  I did appreciate that. Here is where it turned downhill for me. Waiter brings me the check and I pay and sign the receipt. Now I am with customers discussing business and they start to bus the table pretty quickly. The waiter comes by and says thank you, picks up the signed receipt. Our table was next to the computer terminal, I see our waiter open up and looked to see what his tip was. This really ticked me off. Service was subpar at best from him all night long and I still left 20% Not really sure if I will be going back. Apps - really good, sides decent, steak...fair at best and not worth the high prices they charge.  Not happy that the waiter was more concerned about his tip then providing great customer service which use to be the priority here.",

The food was delicious& cooked to order. The only dishes I would not order again is the king crab avocado stack appetizer & crab& shrimp mac&cheese. The proportion of crab to avocado was off. Too little crab that you ended up with spoonfuls of only avocado which was weird &not very pleasant. Don't get me wrong.  I love avocado but in plain spoonfuls it is hard to eat. The mac & cheese was good but not as good as to justify the price.   Loved the ribeye & brussel sprouts. And the service was amazing. The only reason this is not a 5 star is because the dining area is really really dark. The lights are so dim that it was really hard to see each other's faces across the table & we even had to use our cell phone flashlights to read the menu.",

    "text": "We decided to come here for my birthday. My son was dying to come here. So what the heck I made the reservations on Open Table. When you walk into the door the hostess stand is right there so they are able to greet you right away. Very friendly. Very accommodating. We had to wait a few minutes so they could get are table ready. As we walked to our table, we went by the kitchen. The kitchen is enclosed in glass so you can see them working. One thing interesting is that their seafood is on display just like a grocery store. Very fresh and they ship it in every day.   Anyways, our table was semi-private booth for six. The booth was enclosed with glass walls. Very interesting and intimate.   The server was really friendly and was quick to bring our drinks. Always filling our water cups without asking. Anyways, we started off with their hot bread. It was so good. So fresh. Really good.   So I ordered the 16oz ribeye and they always tell you don't touch your plate cause it's 500 degrees. We ordered so many side dishes. Let's see we ordered the sugar snap peas, roasted Brussels sprouts, crispy Hasselback potato, and then our server talked us in to the corn creme brulee. The ribeye was cooked perfectly. Really fresh. Juicy. Loved it and completely destroyed it. All of our sides were so good. We finished them all off. Loved the corn creme brulee really good and probably one of my favorites. The Brussels sprouts, snap peas, and Hasselback potato were right on. Can't go wrong with any of those sides.   My wife got the prime steakhouse meatloaf and I was able to share some. Thought it was really good. Really moist. Very flavorful with the gravy. One thing my wife did say was that it was a little dry cause they didn't provide enough gravy but she just had to ask for some extra gravy and  was good.   My son had the NY Strip and didn't complain. Destroyed it all. My daughter had the ribeye too (good taste just like her dad), and my mom had the Colorado lamb chops. I think she got like three or four chops. My son tried it and thought was a little dry but I didn't try it (no room otherwise I would have).   For dessert, since it was my birthday I got a free dessert. Not to sure but I'm thinking I ordered the warm butter cake. Had this before at Dominick's and it was really good with a side of fresh whip cream. Always a fan their butter cake. We also ordered their red velvet bread pudding. I thought it was good but their butter cake is the best.   I have to agree with all my Yelp friends that I prefer Steak 44 over Dominick's. Just seems more private and intimate. I loved this steakhouse. Great food. Exceptional service. Great atmosphere and a very very friendly and accommodating staff. I really had a great birthday dinner. We'll be back for sure.",

We arrived a little early and were offered to seat right away, that set us up for the great service that flowed through the night.  Our server our back server the host staff all were super friendly and all personally wished us a happy anniversary.    Food was melt in your mouth great.  Our server Brian made recommendations and all were fabulous. We had the KC strip and meatloaf the chef potatoes and Brussel sprouts should have taken his recommendations for apps but ordered calamari instead it was just okay but everything else was perfect.    They even brought us anniversary dessert which was a great touch.    All around great place for a nice dinner or if you are celebrating a special occasion.  We will definitely be putting into our date night rotation and look forward to a return visit.    Thank you to Steak 44 for making our anniversary a special night.",

    "text": "We went here for our anniversary because we were wanting something new. It looks nice, but the set up was quite awkward. There didn't seem to be a place that we wouldn't feel crammed in a corner or eating off of our neighbor's table. I've certainly eaten at restaurants with worse set ups, so I suppose it wasn't a deal breaker. Then, the service. The waiter was constantly interrupting us while we were trying to order, and even left the table at one point while my husband was in the middle of saying what he wanted, only to come back, mutter an unintelligible excuse, and then get both of our orders wrong when she repeated them back to us. We didn't see her again until our food came out, and then again until we got our bill. As we were finishing up, a group of waiters stood a few tables from us and (loudly) complained about every table in the joint while using some very colorful and rude language. Finally, the food. Good god, the food was terrible. The salad was limp and uninspired, the green beans tasted as if they came out of a can and were unpalatable, and the steak was over-seasoned and charred. Perhaps I'm not up to date on modern steak cooking, but I don't believe a medium-rare filet is supposed to have black, burned edges. I couldn't finish it. We certainly will never be back- every single part of our experience was just bad all around.",

Our waiter Jason was knowledgeable and patient. I hate feeling rushed through dinner. It is about the experience and it was wonderful. The food was to die for! We had the meatballs, colossal shrimp and fried deviled eggs - all delicious. For dinner everyone except me got the large filet (I did the bone in ribeye) and they were cooked to perfection. I have never seen a filet so big in my life! Sides were the shrimp and lobster Mac, potatoes that started with the letter D, Brussels, creamed spinach and the regular Mac and cheese for my kiddo. Everyone raved about how great it was. The red velvet bread pudding was ridiculous and my husbands \"adult\" peanut butter shake was awesome. While it is expensive, the portions are huge and the quality is unbeatable. Kenny, the manager, also checked in on us and we received a phone call the next day from reception to ensure our night was great. Would definitely go back if ever in Phoenix again!",

For a return trip, I would select a different cut of steak, a filet or strip perhaps. The dinner also came with delicious rolls.

We seriously felt out if place upon entering, but we were greeted by everyone at the front so we tried to not feel out of place.   Started off with the avocado and crab stack as an appetizer. My husband liked it, but it wasn't for me. I ordered the lamb (I've been ordering this every where I go - trying to find the best one), but unfortunately, it was just okay. Sadly to say that I've had better. My husband got the ribeye with the bone in and that was fantastic! For the sides we got the corn creme brulee and I loved it, fries - were tasty, and mac n cheese (this was okay. At the end we also ordered their strawberry butter cake and it was good. Since my husband made reservations and noted that we were celebrating my birthday, they comp my dessert - sweet deal!   We were surprised to have missed a call from them the following day. They wanted to know how our experience was. I actually came to this restaurant because a co-worker of mine works here and recommended I come. I thought what better day to try than my birthday. How lucky am I that my meal wasn't as great as my husband's? I knew I should have ordered the tomahawk steak!   The only other bummer thing was that we didn't get served bread. Yeah, I know I could have asked for it, but this was a fine dinning restaurant and it was my first time - I was observing and taking notes on how we were being treated. I didn't know how we got missed on our bread, the people to our right, the group in front to the left, group in front to the right, and people seating to our right side - all got bread. Did it bother me -  totally! Why? Made me feel a bit out of place.   I did like the bus boys - they were attentive and friendly.",

Went here last night for our wedding anniversary. Couldn't have had a more perfect experience. The service, the ambience and most of all the food. Tried hard to find something to criticize but I failed.  Might just have to be our favorite restaurant ever. I was really blown away this morning when we received a call from them to ask how our experience was.  That' customer service. They care!!!  Absolutely wonderful. We'll be back!!",

We started off with their salad, and that was the one thing we all thought was in need of improvement....lettuce wasn't a nice green color, dressing was rather boring.  However, moving along to the entrees, two different steaks were ordered, and both were outstanding, even though I asked that they not put \"their rub\" on my steak.  Done almost to perfection...a little more brown than I wanted but it was still juicy and downright yummy.  My husband ordered the meatloaf because he's a meatloaf fan, and gave it a total thumbs up.  The last was a salmon that was done perfectly...just slightly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, and delicious.  Veggies were fresh, crisp,  with a really nice assortment to make the perfect choice for you.  We tried their desserts...both the s'mores and the strawberry cake with ice cream were Outstanding.  If it weren't for the average salad, this would be a 5 star!  We also appreciated the lack of a noisy restaurant.  STEAK was quite busy, but still we could hear our conversation at our table, which we really noticed and appreciated.",

My husband and I ordered cocktails, and chose to not order appetizers or salads to save some room for dessert. It felt like 5 minutes after our order was taken, dinner was on the table. No time to sit and relax with our drinks. The food was fine. My husband ordered the bone in filet, son ordered bone in New York and I ordered the veal chop. Sides were Brussels Sprouts, fries and Dominicks potatoes. Side were adequate in size, the fries were cold.  I don't think the experience would bring me back to Steak 44. The meal was fine, ok, but that's it. We enjoy other steak houses in town.  It just wasn't great, and I had expected great. We won't be back.",

I worried at first it would overcook my meat but that of course was not the case. I also had the Brussel sprouts and they were a delightful surprise. The potatoes were cheesy and delicious. The only thing I didn't care for as much was the beet salad. I have to admit I'm someone of a snob about beet salads as I love them so much. However I found this salad did not have as much \"vinegar\" as I like it personally. It had sort of an orange flavor that I found not as appealing. I still gave the review 5 stars because my colleague liked it so it was more my preference. Also I thought the salad too large for a pre-meal dish. I wish I had tried the desserts because I heard they are truly wonderful...next time. They are pretty expensive and I was glad it was a business dinner as I would consider this a \"special occasion\" place rather than a place I would eat regularly due to the price. The entrees were $35-$40 and everything was ala carte. The service was outstanding. Our server was almost TOO attentive truthfully but he was very friendly and made some great suggestions which I always appreciate. If you're looking for a great meal this is certainly the place.",

We shared the baked creamed spinach which was really good. The baked potatoes..just ok. Sides are a little smaller than Mastro's but priced accordingly. Our server Matthew was excellent.

We started with Oyster appetizers from the raw bar, which a couple of us enjoyed and 3 salads - the beet salad was a rave and the caesars could have had a bit more flavor in the dressing, but the poached egg was enjoyable. The complimentary rolls that came out right away were buttery, hot and light [mouth-clouds] .. We all had steaks that were sizzled to perfection with a couple of toppings, the bordelaise our daughter and son enjoyed and the truffle butter was just the flavor boost expected. Sides were the house potato au gratin, corn brulee [as good as a dessert], wild mushrooms and the Brussels Sprouts, which even naysayers at our table enjoyed. Desserts were fun, tasty and generous including a complimentary birthday dessert.  Service was outstanding in every aspect; our server, Jane, was the perfect balance of informative, attentive and made solid suggestions.  Every wait staff member was friendly, with perfect pacing and non-intrusive.  It was a very busy Friday night yet  we were seated on the dot of our reservation.  Thanks Steak 44 for providing a memorable celebration, we will be back to our new favorite dining destination, hopefully soon!",

The service was flawless and the food was outstanding.  Our server, Johnny, was fantastic and knew his wines.  He was very honest and recommended I NOT order the twin lobster tails (and only order one instead) because I had mentioned I was not a big eater.  The Pinot Noir he recommended was perfect with the lobster and the shrimp.  The crispy shrimp appetizer is unusual and delicious.  My husband's steak was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife.  I had lobster and it was perfect.  It was our anniversary so for dessert, they brought us a warm, butter pound cake with fresh strawberry topping and ice cream.  It was to die for.  We cannot say enough about this restaurant and highly recommend it.  But it is a lot of food and very rich; so bring your appetite.",

It is that tender and delicious.  Forget the steak sauce.  You will enjoy the flavor of the steak just as is.  It comes out on a 400 degree plate.  The sides,  Absolutely wonderful.  They put a little twist on each one and 1 side is more than plenty to share.  But get two,  it is impossible to pick just one.  The service,  unbelievable.  The best ever.  We were a large group of 20.  They put us in a room of our own.  We had 5 waiters/servers who were very attentive,  friendly, fun and I know it is a big job when you ask to have separate checks for everyone, but the waiter did and there was not one mistake on anyone's check.   Some of us finished with a dessert.  The red velvet bread pudding was lush.  It wasn't too sweet and even though I was full, I still had to have another bite.

    "text": "So this place goes beyond excellent food. I came here last night with 2 other coworkers.   I started my meal with the chopped salad. The amount of blue cheese and bacon was amazing! It was probably the best chopped salad I've eaten in a while.  I ordered the bone in filet (medium rare). When the steak came out, it was completely overcooked. Typically, this situation is frustrating and I end up asking to have the manager come over. Not at Steak 44. What happened next was just short of not believable. The server stopped by, I asked him if he thought my steak was medium rare. He immediately apologized and took the plate away. Not less than a minute later the manager came to the table to apologize and talk to me about my evening. About a minute later the GM stopped by to let me know my steak was being prepared and the chef would be delivering it in a minute. About a minute later, the chef brought me my steak. The customer service and class of the whole team really made me forget about an error that happens. They brought fresh new sides to the table. I ate that amazing piece of delicious meat and smiled the whole time. I was in disbelief that I didn't even have a chance to be upset. They took care of everything.   At the end of the meal, the server brought over desserts for the table (complimentary).    This place has won my business with the great food, but really the customer service. Professionals.   Btw, order the crem brulee corn... it could have been my favorite part which is scary because the steak was in the top of the class.",

    "text": "Being a former vegan, purposely going out for steak isn't a \"best practice\" for me but, had a work dinner with peers from Boston. Steak 44 is in one word- upscale yet, not too stuffy. Music playing in background ranges from Prince to ABBA to Journey to Duran Duran. The eclectic music array was perfect for the surroundings. I think it accommodated a diverse demographic. SO- I was starving and as usual a little  indecisive. My peer and I discovered we are foodie twins! We both had the same taste in food & preferences as to menu options. We split an 8oz filet mignon with the scallops. It was plenty. Medium well is medium well so, if you want your meat medium- it's pink. I can't do pink- steak tar tar is too much for me. I'm not sure hearing about how the meat is prepared made me feel inquisitive about the preparation. It made me sad but, greatful to have such a sacrifice. I love cows so, for me hearing about how they are cut and prepared- breaks my heart. Felt blessed. The drink menu- wide array to chose from. Wine  is not typically my drink of choice however, \"when in Rome.\" I had the white Chardonnay that wasn't $25 a glass like the Cakebread which I typically would order because, it's the perfect steak   wine. The side dishes are like Bucca Di Peppo except for being smaller in proportion and classy. My group of 6 shared the Cream Broulet  Corn, Brussels Sprouts, Fried Deviled Eggs and the Crispy Shrimp  O- we also had the meatballs! For  dessert- the warm vanilla bean  cake, topped off with a hot coffee  & whipped cream (fresh.) Fancy! Maybe a good first date place. Like a meet & greet! Pricy yet, service is not lacking. We were checked in on by management had plates cleared and were absolutely attended to. Our waitress Jane also was very familiar with the menu and comfortable making suggestions. 5 Stars",

I had a Manhattan at the bar which felt like two drinks before we got seated. We got oysters as appetizers paired with a white wine which was awesome. These are not your run of the mill oysters and are highly recommended.   For our entree we each ended up getting New York strips, but all also got one premium cut to share which was really special. The sides were all outstanding, but the best ones came at the recommendation of our server.   I'll definitely be coming back here.

Her professionalism and courteousness, willingness to walk is through the menu screamed Manhattan fine dining.   The experience she facilitated as steward brought me and my group the best steakhouse experience we have had.  Business travelers don't miss it.",

It's a relaxing place to dine with amazing food(rib eye steaks, shrimp apps, burrata, beignets just to name a few favorites) with equally great drinks. Their wine selection seems endless.",

    "text": "Wow where do I start. From the minute we  walked in, until the minute we left... PERFECTION. Greeted very warmly, we told the host we had a reservation. As they prepared our table, the host was communicating with Mariol about the restaurant. When seated, the server  assistant (forgot his name unfortunately) Gave is our options for different types of water, was very professional, and friendly. Our server, Scott, was such an out of the park, elegant as well as approachable, funny, and just all around outstanding server. He answered every single question we had, about wine, the menu, even down to the farm the Wagyu beef is from. He gave us recommendations, and ensured we got the most of our experience. We ordered a bottle of wine, and when we did our cheers for our anniversary we were celebrating, Scott discreetly paid attention, and when we finished our meal, said he overheard us discussing our anniversary, and insisted we got dessert, on the house! What a great guy. Would definitely recommend requesting him, this was our first time in to Steak 44, and we will be sure to return after the overall experience that we received.  For dinner we Started off with the Rhode Island calamari and shrimp combo, which was absolutely delicious. Probably my favorite calamari I have ever had. I got a 8oz filet mignon, and my boyfriend ordered the 16 oz New York Strip, both requested medium rare. Cooked exactly to temperature, red throughout with a cool red center. Belicimo! For a side, we split the Corn Brule... DO NOT MISS THIS YOU MUST ORDER IT!!! Imagine a sweet corn, with cream, caramelized. How could you not be curious? Let your curiosity enhance your experience! This was so good!!!  For our complimentary dessert, we opted for the off the menu special, a chocolate torte with a raspberry sauce and an almond crust of some sort. Wish I remembered the exact description, but just like the rest of our meal, it was perfect.  All in all, this was the perfect way to end our anniversary, thanks Steak 44 for the wonderful experience. See you soon!",

He even got to choose a free dessert for his birthday!  We will definitely be going back!  We were an hours drive away but this place is worth the drive!  Many other restaurants should take lessons from this place with service and food preparation!  Love this place!  Best steakhouse ever!  And we go to every steakhouse in many cities!

At this time, one is able to order the small plates happy hour menu and drinks for $9.00. If we lived in France, their small plates, at a reduced price, would be a full meal. I ordered the filet and fries (Steak and Frites). Perfect! A small plate of soft, crusty rolls arrives first...  I double dare you not to eat ALL of them! My hubby ordered the wedge salad w blue cheese dressing and it looked terrific. This is a slightly upscale restaurant with a robust happy hour crowd. The food was delicious and the service first-rate. We will return to explore the regular dinner menu.",

I had a hard time hearing my girlfriend sitting across from me.  The dress code also seems to be, non-existent.  Saw a gentlemen in shorts, t-shirt, and flip flops with backwards hat being seated in the main dining room.  Nothing wrong with this, just a first for me at a steakhouse.  With that out of the way, the food was very reasonably priced and tasty.  We got a bottle of house red for under $40  (most places we've been have been $60 minimum).  I got the rib eye and the mac and cheese as a side.  Both were good, but I wouldn't go so far as great.  If you're looking for a place for a romantic date or a business meeting - this isn't it.  If you're looking for a good steakhouse to go with with your buddies after a round of golf or before you hit the clubs for the evening, this is your place.",

My wife and I have been to all the nice steak places in Scottsdale and Phoenix such as Mastro's , Capital Grill, Flemmings, . We only go when her mother visits. This was our first visit to Steak 44. Our experience was poor. My mother in laws steak was full of grizzle and very tough. I gave her mine and ate hers. Poor quality for a petite filet. I told our waiter Josh about it after dinner before the check was delivered. I expected some modification of the bill. Got nothing. Much better choices for steak exist in this area.  I would like to add that I along with three others returned to Steak 44 on July 4. We had a fabulous dinner with superb service.

    "text": "We loved it and why!  We are celebrating our 20th anniversary here in Scottsdale all the way from Michigan.  Must read this review!  We almost left... The place was stylish, packed with well dressed people but causal and definitely the hot place to be on a Friday night.   However, as expected the wait was very very long.  We looked around at the bar area for seats but no luck.  As we were about ready to leave, a women at the bar signaled us that they were leaving and we squeezed through the crowded area and took over two seats.  We were just happy to be seated.    THE SERVICE At this point we were not expecting too much since the bar was shoulder to shoulder, then Brian Kelly, the bartender showed up.  We instantly realized that our bartender was not your normal bartender.   He was as good as any 5 star server at your premier restaurants.   He made us feel like we were his only customer at all times, his recommendations were perfect, explained the menu as if he was the chef, described the food to perfect detail, kept our drinks full and we never wanted for a thing.  It turned out that we actually had the best seats in the house!!  Just people watching was fun :)  THE FOOD We started out with the colossal shrimp cocktail and oysters (Amazing!), then we split the bone-in rib-eye with lobster tail and a couple sides of deliciousness (mushrooms and brussel sprouts). The ribeye was cooked to perfection (medium rare plus 1), the lobster was super tender and mouthwatering all while enjoying our bottle of Robert Craig.   The dessert took us over the edge, can't spell it -beignets?-but it was a superior fried doughnut that put Krispy Kreme to shame and two glasses of Dolce that put the cherry on top.     Thank you Steak 44 for a great evening and making our dinner one to remember.   Don't pass this place up.  Go see Brian Kelly at the bar!",

    "text": "Oh so good.   Quick side note, that we moved here from CLE.  I know that most people wouldn't associate CLE with great food and restaurants, but there are tons there.  It is a big foodie town.  So since moving to Scottsdale, we have been in search of a new steak place.  Steak 44 is it.  (Anyone from CLE?  Think RED the steakhouse.)  Pep talk your wallet before you come here.  It is oh so good, but oh so pricey.    We started out with the rolls in the cast iron skillet and the shrimp and calamari with dipping sauces appetizer.  I could have stopped eating there, but I didn't.   Then we moved on to steaks and sides.  My husband had the bone in strip, I had the bone in filet, and we shared the brussel sprouts and mushrooms.  Both pieces of meat were amazing. They are served on a 500 degree plate, so your food is still cooking when it comes to you. I wasn't sure that the bone-in would make a difference, but it absolutely did. I really enjoyed the mushrooms too.  Many people mention the brussel sprouts, they were good, but not the best I have ever had.  Still, not like it ruined the meal or anything.  All in all, a great experience.  We were stuffed and still had a strawberry something for dessert.  It was very yummy, but my husband and I were so full at this point, we each took two bites and waived the white flag. Our drinks were also great.  My husband had bourbon and I had a dirty martini.   Complete side note here, the bathrooms here are awesome.  You just have to go and see for yourself.  You don't get a stall, you get your own room.  It's crazy!     Last, is service.  It was fantastic!  Our waitress was knowledgeable, fun, and made our first time at Steak 44 memorable.  Love this place and hope to go back soon!",

The steaks were cooked perfectly and everything was exactly as it should be at a prime steakhouse. Our server, Matthew, provided great recommendations and was available if we needed anything. Wow...Did I say it was exceptional!",
