After all, pho is the main factor here.  I was really disappointed by their pho.  The broth was bland and lacked flavor.  The meat was okay, but the portions were a bit small.  I'm gonna have to stick with Central King Eggroll for pho - the only place I've found in AZ that is even close to CA pho quality.",

    "text": "At first sight, you can't help but fall in love with this cute little restaurant. It was my very first experience eating vietnamese food, so I already was pretty nervous. Our server was very quick at getting our drinks and answering any questions we had. Overwhelmed, by the amount of options I decided to play it safe and choose a noodle stir fry. I am not a picky eater by any means, but I wanted to make sure I started out with something I knew I would like. When my meal came out I realized that I had accidentally ordered the flat noodles instead of the egg noodles. When our server returned I apologized about my mix up and asked how to not make the same mistake next time when ordering. He took my plate back to change the noodles and quickly returned with a new plate of food. I noticed that an older gentlemen, who turned out to be the owner, was following behind. I expected him to ask how my food was, but NO he came up to my chair and began yelling at me. He yelled at me for not choosing the correct dish the first time and said next time I come in I better choose right the first time and not waste his money/food. I was completely shaken up. I have NEVER been yelled at anyone at a restaurant...let alone an owner. I was completely embarrassed because there were other customers seated around us.   I never will go back to this restaurant again. The customer service from the server was great, but I was completely disrespected and deeply embarrassed by the owner. No one should ever get yelled at or have their feelings hurt when they go out to eat especially by the owner.   Very sad and disappointed.",

Fast service! We started with the pot stickers, which were homemade and fresh. Very tasty. the Pho was great, too. The nice lady who took our order was very great. My spousal equivalent is not a fan of fish. When he ordered a noodle dish that sounded tasty, she gave us a heads up that is has a strong flavor of fish sauce. Tragedy averted; he ordered something else. I could not finish my noodles and a take-out dish was promptly offered. Very pleased with our dinner; give it a try!",

If that's the case, why don't they post closing hours as 2:30?  My family use to run a restaurant and our customers and business were important to us.  If someone came 5 or 10 or more minutes after our posted closing, we would still welcome them.  In this economy, the majority of restaurants we have gone to have gone out of their way to provide good service.  I guess this place doesn't need or value the business.  I'm giving them 1 star only because someone recommended this place but I will not be returning to see what we missed.  There are plenty of excellent Vietnamese restaurants in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "I can't add much to the great reviews, except I had to rave about Little Saigon!  I've tried a few Vietnamese restaurants on the west side, then my hubby stumbled across Little Saigon on his first trip to Yelpland.  Located in charming downtown Glendale only two miles from home, we went there on a Saturday night.  There is a generous patio with lovely twinkle lights, and you can hear the music from the coffee shop across the street.  The interior is bright and cheerful, with, I think, 3 rooms.  The place was almost full - always a good sign, and a very friendly waiter seated us and took our drink orders.  The menu is generous, and the prices reasonable.  We shared spring rolls and potstickers.  Best spring roll ever, methinks: not too much lettuce as filler, delish pork and shrimp that tastes like it once swam, with a light peanut sauce that does not overwhelm.  The potstickers were also great - generously filled with tasty pork and veggies, complimented by a mild Asian BBQ sauce.  We were off to a good start.  Hubs, who is new to Vietnamese cuisine, and who gets props for trying, chose a pan fried rice noodle dish with meat (at least chicken and shrimp) and veggies.  He thoroughly enjoyed it, generously offering me one bite, and pretending not to notice when I stole a couple more.   Just as my bench-mark dish for rating Thai restaurants is Pad Thai, my dish for Vietnamese food is Bun Thit Nuong (or Bun Thit Heo Nuong here).  My bowl had all the right stuff: tender, flavorful grilled pork (not a speck of gristle - a first in Phoenix!), lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, and julienned cukes, vermicelli and sauce.  I love the sweet, vinegary sauce that comes with Bun Thit Nuong, and my sweet server told me the ingredients.  It was simply so very good.  Little Saigon has the whole package:  clean, cute, friendly and attentive service, and excellent food.  We can't wait to go back and try some of the other things on the menu, and mentioned in Yelp reviews.  Can you say \"Yum, yum\", Dum Dum?",

Although some of the tables are pretty close to each other, it is a very comfortable environment. The dining experience was much nicer than I expected! My favorite Vietnamese dish is the vermicelli bowl with pork, and I also always get spring rolls. The meal here was one very good. It didn't meet up to my all-time favorite (Pho Tau Bay in New Orleans) and I think Da Vang makes it slightly better, but it was very good. The spring rolls were much better than those at the other places I've tried. (Sidenote: Really, how hard is it to make these? How can places like Saigon Nites and Cyclo not make them as good as me? And I'm a Cajun that learned by reading the back of a spring roll wrapper container!) My companion thoroughly enjoyed the boba tea; I didn't think it was worth the money, as it was only so-so. I did enjoy a good Vietnamese beer, but I don't remember what kind it was. Other than the beverages, the prices were reasonable. As mentioned by others, it's hard to find a place to park, but it's definitely a great place to eat (quality and price) if you are in downtown Glendale.",

    "text": "Good Afternooooon, Vietnam!  Did somebody say lunch time?  Somewhere I heard someone say something about some food.  What a pleasant surprise this Little Saigon is. Nice openness - little rooms with big tables. The atmosphere was comfortable with a capital C - from seating, ordering, eating, to asking questions about the menu. I even felt comfortable being the typical annoying customer.   Our servers were very kind and pleasantly accommodating. They informed the vegetarians in our party of chicken stock in the soup broth. Did we care?   -- begin moment of silence -- ...thinking of the chickens who gave their lives. Uhhhh...a little animal flesh and blood never hurt nobody.   -- end moment of silence --  Soup! Soup! Soup! Soup!  Food was tasty and plentiful. We ordered a multitude of items like three appetizers, boba, fried rice, tofu, veggies, spinach and onions, and a curry dish. Here were my personal choices:  1. Deep fried vegetarian egg rolls ($6) - six small crispy rolls accompanied by romaine leaves, parsley, mint, slices of cucumber and carrot. The rolls have tofu inside. I found one cube of it in each roll that was easily picked out with chop sticks.  2. Lotus root salad ($7) - sans pork. Tasty marinated lotus root and veggies served with four crunchy shrimp flavored rice chips on the side. Lotus is easily identifiable by sight, but its taste blended with the other veggies. The texture of it though is also unique. It reminded me of bamboo slices that get served in chow mein.  3. Bok choy soup w/ginger and onions ($8) - served in large bowl. Very good broth, close to a quart with dark green bok choy and few pieces of ginger and onion. The veggies alone would not be filling, but if you drink all the broth, you'd be full for the next hour or so.  4. Eggplant with onions and veggies ($8) - ordered spicy. It was good, but was not as spicy as I hoped. Took home leftovers.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to any vegetarian looking to try Vietnamese food.",

No matter though, it's still Pho, right?  I actually don't mind the lighter soup since it didn't make me feel as heavy/sleepy when walking out of the restaurant.  Aside from the on-the-light-side taste, the portions were good with plentiful amounts of beef, tripe, and tendon.  They also seem to serve chicken Pho here, too so if you want to avoid red meat you might want to try that out.    This place seems much more accommodating than other Pho places, most likely because the servers here actually know how to speak English.  For those who worry about poor service, you won't find that here.  These guys were on top of my water never being empty (a big one with Pho noodle soup, since it really seems to dehydrate you).  My dad also tried the Thai Boba Tea and said the boba was decent (I'm not a fan of Thai Tea, sorry!).    As for prices, they're a little on the steeper side of Pho at $9 for a combo soup, but as I mentioned above the portions are good so I would say it is worth it.",

    "text": "Legit yummy! A friend and I met up for early lunch last Saturday and we loved the character and charm of the remade house, complete with potted plants and picket fence. As Yelpers suggested, I parked at the thrift store parking lot just north of the restaurant, but there's also street parking available on 57th Ave.  We showed up close to open because we were both starving and hate crowds. The inside was small, but I loved the nice touches like flowers on the table along with a full assortment of condiments, curtains on the windows, and fairly intimate setting.   I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of service after reading the below reviews, but it started off great - the waiter was friendly and offered to answer any questions we had. I had a Vietnamese coffee and my friend ordered a plain boba tea. Her tea was great, and my coffee was good, but not awesome. I enjoy watching the coffee sit and drip into the condensed milk myself and savoring that rich aroma, but here, they prepped the coffee in the back and just brought me the finished glass. It could have been a bit creamier, but it wasn't too sweet, and the coffee was delightfully strong.   We started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls (#2), which were a bit bigger (longer) than the ones I'd had in other restaurants, so they were sliced in half - $4 was fair for two of these bad boys. They were absolutely scrumptious and very fresh, but packed a little loosely, so the goodies kept falling out as I was trying to dip the roll. I'd recommend grabbing your spoon and scooping the peanut sauce as you need it. Also, try it with the red chile sauce on the table...yum.   We both had our hearts set on pho and ordered two bowls of sliced beef & shrimp pho, #12. The server remarked that it was his favorite menu item, so we were excited. The plate of goodies on the side did not disappoint, but we could have used some extra cilantro and basil. The flavor was just salty enough, the shrimp were more generously sized that I expected, and the beef was tender and not fatty or oily. I've noticed that some Vietnamese restaurants tend to add oil to their pho, and thankfully, Little Saigon did not. The bowl wasn't very greasy at all.  When we had gorged ourselves on delicious pho, we hung out for a few minutes and caught up. This is when I could see what other Yelpers had experienced in terms of service - as soon as the restaurant started to fill up, the servers became stressed and harried, checking tables with visible impatience. That's a bit ridiculous when you're making your way through a giant bowl of pho. I always tip extra if I stay a little longer, so I wasn't about to guilt myself into leaving. When we left a few minutes later, there was a grand total of two people waiting out in the foyer.   I also noticed that Little Saigon has a sizeable patio area out front with lots of potential, but a sign read \"patio closed.\" If seating's an issue, guys, open up the patio. Shame too, it was a beautiful day. Unfortunately, indoors got a bit stuffy and warm, especially near our window seat. I even checked to see whether the window would open...lol.  Before tip, a boba tea, Vietnamese coffee, two spring rolls, and two bowls of delicious pho came to $30. Not bad for being stuffed out of our gourds.  Overall: solid Vietnamese cuisine, frankly the best (excluding homemade) I've had in the Valley. For you Vietnamese noobs, the menu details everything clearly and is organized by types of noodles - a must for gluten-free eaters (the rice noodles are great!). However, I'll be sure to get there during their non-peak hours to skip the attitude.",

Once in a while, we'll do the catfish soup or the spicy chicken. We've never been disappointed with a meal from here.

    "text": "After staring at the pictures on here and being shut down the last time I tried to order out from the place I decided to go in person and give them a second chance.   We went on a Saturday night. Even though the place clearly says you have to be there by 8:30 to be seated, the sign on the door was already turned to the closed side and it was 8:07!!?? What is the deal with this place? I felt like just turning and walking away but the wife insisted on going in. The place was completely dead. Maybe 3 tables of customers and a group of relatives at another table. The inside is like you are in someones house that was converted to a restaurant. Nothing fancy and the walls need a really good scrubbing but for the most part it was relatively clean. The house is located on the northwest side of the street. Just south of a St Vincent De Paul building.   We were seated right away and ordered some spring rolls first. They were clear rolls and were stuffed with shrimp, beef, noodles, and some cilantro. There were two decent sized rolls and came with a peanut dipping sauce. They were tasty but I couldn't help but think they would be much better warm.   I ordered the 27 Pho ap Chao - pan fried noodle stir fry w/ beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, and veggies. It was piping hot and had a pretty decent flavor to it. It had a massive amount of vegetables. I am talking carrots, leaks, snow peas, etc. It could have used a little more meat but other than that it was very good. Then at the bottom of the dish I finally dug my way to the pan fried noodles. They were outstanding. Crunchy but soft. Burnt a little but not too much. They may have been the best part of the dish. My wife ordered some spicy chicken with vegetables. Her meal came with white rice and was huge as well. It tasted very similar to my dish but without the bomb noodles.   The server was very friendly and it seemed very much like a family ran business. The entire bill came out to under 30 bucks and could have fed two more people. I am very glad I gave this place a second and third chance. My only suggestion would be to either stop doing phone orders or provide the extra service and to not put your closed sign up when you are supposed to be open for almost another whole hour. If this place wasn't recommended from a friend I probably would have never gave it another chance.   To their defense they have a sign that states they do not take phone orders when they are busy. Maybe they should at the least put that on their answering machine so people don't keep trying to call back? That being said, their food is terrific, the portions are generous, and I can't wait to go back. Next time I will be sure to try and get there a little sooner.",

We decided to give it a shot. The place is a cozy little house in Glendale. We were welcomed by the son of the owner and he greeted us like we were family. We were seated promptly and a great meal ensued! We especially like the veggie fried rolls app. Delicious! The curry chicken dish was good, but the cuts of chicken could've been better. We will be back and recommend you check this place out!",

Ive had better but maybe its because im comparing it to CA.  Favorite here in Az, at least in phoenix area is still the one off of camelback and 17th believe.  The soup for the beef pho was not very good, too much oil and really not flavorful.  The rice dish was good but small portion.  My bf seemed to enjoy it.  Overall id eat there again if I really wanted pho and my usual spot isnt opened.",

To start, the server forgot one of our five drinks. One meal was missing a meat. The most annoying thing about our last visit was that they forgot to make my wife's meal and started cooking it after the rest of us had nearly finished our meal, and every other table (seated after us) was served. When the meal finally arrived, everyone else had finished so we asked for the meal to go expecting it to be free because it came out ridiculously late and was clearly forgotten. Instead of an apology we were told that if we wanted the meal we had to pay for it despite it being forgotten and arriving after everyone else had finished.   The service was just bad. Not once did anyone apologize for any of the forgotten items and to argue over a $9 meal with customers who come often and with guests just seems petty. We'll take our guests to one of the many other Vietnamese establishments in the valley from now on.    Go somewhere else",

My salad was laced with fresh herbs and white meat chicken and a fresh light limey dressing. It's a perfect meal for when your running around and it's hot outside. I thought the small salad would be too small but the large is more than I can eat. So small salad and and an appetizer or dessert is the way to go.  My husband had a pork and rice plate. It was very good and came with a fried egg and a crispy pork filled roll.   I wanted to try a macaron but our server got busy and slapped our check on the table while we were eating.

The nuc mam is watered down, and to our luck my bf gets a hair in the food. He was cool about it, didn't make a scene and it takes about 15 mins to be noticed by a waiter, he sends back the pho with the hair. It takes another 20 mins to the pho back. The pho has less meat and broth. At the end we ended up paying for everything or didn't get an apology or discount since the pho did have hair",

It can be a little hard to find so bring your GPS or cell phone.  Came here with my new Yelp friend Michael C for a mini UYE. We were trying to find a new place with some spicy kick and decided to give this place a test drive.  Ordered some Veggie Spring Rolls and some Catfish Soup. Mr Mike went with a Spicy Chicken and Noodle dish and had them make it extra spicy. They also have plenty of nifty condiments to jazz things up a bit on the table.  Both the food and the service were outstanding and the prices were very reasonable. Their menu has a good variety of Vietnamese favorites and you can have them customize the ingredients if there are certain foods that you should not be eating.  Looking forward to bringing my wife here and treating her to a nice comfortable meal. The cool part is afterwards you can go for a swell walkabout around the downtown area and visit some of their really old town and classic shops as well as just soaking up some scenery.

    "text": "My first time exploring a new Vietnamese restaurant in AZ. I ordered the special dry noodles and a friend order Pho special. My noodles came out looking very greasy due to how it was prepared. Very much Chinese food style, the broth is not hot enough, green onions is stale, the broth lack of flavor from the slow cook of the bone, same for the pho. It's a family operation and home atmosphere. The food is not as authentic as I like it to be. The flavor is gear towards non traditional Vietnamese food.  Overall, service is great, ambient is good, food is ok to my expectations for authentic Vietnamese. I would not comeback or recommend to friends if they love authentic Vietnamese food. It's average food to my personal opinion.  Enjoy",

    "text": "My friends have been raving about thus place for months. We finally made it out here to try it. The place was packed for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. Good sign. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table.  Feels like a large house turned into a restaurant. We were seated in s smaller room to the side. Only 2 servers working together. Both were hostesses and cashier and everything else st the same time. One took our drink order and ran off. Before drinks came the other server came over to take the order. Very rushy (is that a word)? I knew what I wanted from the awesome Yelper pics. So I explained to her that I was highly allergic to shellfish. Usually, actually, ALWAYS, when I mention the allergies, the servers go out of their way to make me feel welcomed. Always accommodate my needs and triple reassurance that my meal will be prepared and cooked separately and without contamination to any seafood. The server with a smirky and \"not my problem \" attitude told me that everything was prepared and marinated with fish sauce and contaminated with seafood while under preparation. Which I thought food preparation had to be separated. However, she then went on to tell me if u get hives I can't help u. If u need an epipen I can't help you. Her attitude was enough for my hubby and I to say thank you but we'll pass. And left to eat at a friendlier more accommodating Asian restaurant. Actually made me sad because the food looked so good but I'm not going to put my health in danger. And I will not let my allergies become a joke to unprofessional ppl. Had a nice lunch elsewhere.",

As for the pho, I have heard from many reliable sources how delicious it is. I put too much cilantro in mine the first time, but even so it was pretty good. Just uh...make sure you go with someone that knows how to eat pho, because I did not and that's why I messed up. Make sure to put the meat, bean sprouts, and noodles in first. Everything else is up to your own liking.   Now this place is a 40 minute drive for me during rush hour, which should show my devotion. The staff were friendly, the food was ready when I got there. Just be prepared for there to be a lot of old asshole customers. You know the kind. Snow birds. But if you tell them to fuck off, you'll have evening entertainment too.   Now excuse me while I go daydream about the spring rolls more.",

    "text": "We went to Little Saigon a few months ago, with the expectation that this is gonna be one of the few places with great Vietnamese food we can fall back on when we crave it due to all the great reviews on Yelp. However, just like another one in Cave Creek, it blew away my expectations, and not in a good way. I dunno what it is, but maybe since I'm Asian and I go to Vietnamese restaurants you can give us crap food and crap service? Hell, I don't even care about the service, all I really care about is the food.  Service - ok. barely. nobody bothered to refill our drinks, even though we were right outside the kitchen, with NOBODY else there dining at the time. The girl took forever to come take our order, messed up our order, and had trouble with the credit card machine afterwards as well. Damn. If you were new (don't know for sure) at least let us know what to expect.  Food: We ordered spring rolls, chicken pho, cold noodles, and the infamous #55 spare ribs that many people raved about via quick tips at the time.  Spring rolls: Ok, but the peanut sauce tasted like...well...let's just say water would've had more flavor. How can you mess up peanut sauce?  Pho: not bad, but nothing great to write home about.  Cold noodles: see above   infamous #55 spare ribs: Well, I don't really know. When we got this thing in a clay pot, we opened it, and there were pieces of fish. We were like WTF? We asked the waitress, to which she replied, yes, that's #55. We asked if #55 was fish, and not spare ribs, to which the waitress replied yes. She then goes back into the kitchen, and moments later, the cook comes out, asks us if we wanted spare ribs, which we confirmed. He then said he would cook us the spare ribs, and took away the clay pot full of fish. It wouldn't have been so bad if the spare ribs were amazing, but what came back was a few lumps of meat on bone that was submerged in black pepper. Of course, there were no apologies. If you go to their website and look at their menu, #55 is clearly NOT fish.  After we finished what barely passed as dinner, we got our bill, and gave our dedit card to the waitress. She seemed to have a lot of trouble with the credit card machine, and apparently entered in the wrong amount the first time, so she had to do a refund and start a new transaction. Normally, not a big deal. However, she was fumbling around, not saying anything, then going in and out the kitchen with our debit card, then finally someone showed her what to do. In the meantime, we were starting to wonder if they had taken down our debit card number, and if our checking account was going to be wiped out by the time we got home (did not, thank god).   Needless to say, we won't be back...",

When we (3) first entered the restaurant, no one greeted us and there was a party of 10 and 2 in front us. Many people showed up after us, so it seemed that the restaurant was popular. After 25 minutes, the party of 2 left while the party before us waited an hour before they were seated. And yet even after they had just been seated, a party member had to grab the menus themselves from the front because of the lack of service. If a restaurant receives as many high reviews, then high quality service has to be accompanied with it. I don't care if the food supposedly tastes good. If the servers don't even apologize, let alone acknowledge you, why bother?",

Another nice to know is that most of the cafes, restaurants and coffee shops have their own mini version (not as artsy and far from crowded) of First Friday activity. Little Saigon sits in the hub (if you will) of all things cool in DT Glendale. Alley way karaoke seems to be a common attraction. Most of the boutiques and antique shops do close up early so the most you will get is some interesting window shopping.  Fill yer flask, take a stroll.",

If you like pacing your appetizer and meal make sure to order your appetizer and do not order your meal til you are almost finished with the appetizer. This restaurant does not do very well with timing of meals mostly because it is a small restaurant and they need to get people in and out in order to accommodate everyone. That being said, if they are busy this is not a place to hang out and hog a table for hours. Enjoy a great Vietnamese meal and then enjoy down town Glendale if you want to visit with your friends.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Little Saigon for almost 20 years. In that time I have experienced several other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley, but consider only one the best - Little Saigon.  The place: A family run business located in a quaint, converted house that has a great vibe. Lots of warm feeling wood and decorated with traditional Vietnamese art and items. This is the only Vietnamese restaurant I have been to that cares about it's appearance as much as the food. The bathrooms are very nice and clean. Other Viet restaurants are usually found in strip malls, having all the ambience of going to the DMV.   The staff: Always friendly and attentive, especially John and his wife. John's dad is usually in the kitchen making the fantastic food that has kept me going back for years. If you ever need guidance through the extensive menu or need help on what to order, John will hook you up.  The food: Now let's talk about the best part of Little Saigon, the food. From the Pho to the Bun and clay pots, Little Saigon has it where it counts.  Fresh herbs and vegetables (nothing canned) and tender meats make it a great experience.  My personal favorite are the Bun bowls (Rice noodle salad).  The meats are marinated and gilled, having lots of flavor.  Noodles are done to perfection and the lettuce greens and herbs are always fresh.  The Pho (soups) are the perfect thing for a cool day and even in the summer. Flavorful broth with noodles, beef slices or meatballs (yes, meatballs) and more of those great herbs like mint and cilantro. Yum!  My wife is a fan of the clay pots for the slightly more intense flavors found with these meals. I enjoy them as well.  The beer I prefer to drink with my meals is the Vietnamese \"33 Export\" they serve. Similar to Tsing Tao, but seems to have a little more kick, ;)  If you are trying Vietnamese food for the fist time, I highly recommend Little Saigon.   You won't be disappointed and probably will get hooked like I did years ago.",

I got the #37 pork tenderloin with shrimp and egg - a delicious, thin marinated pork chop that was simple yet satisfying.  My wife got #56, which is a spare rib with a sweet and salty sauce, baked and served in a clay pot.  The dish is very flavorful and probably best shared between two people while paired with a less savory second dish to even out the palate.  I see a few complaints about the service - it's never been a problem for me, though they did recently stop taking Amex cards so no luck burning my recently received gift card...",

If a restaurant has certain hours, I was always under the impression the kitchen is open until the closing time.  May take a while for me to want to come back here.

Another server did the rest. And they would check on every table a lot except ours, because they probably thought white ppl tipped better. I ordered calamari and it was a bit burnt at parts meaning black. It was bland. I barely ate any and just drank soup from what my SO ordered. Servers obviously noticed I barely ate, not once did they ask \"is something wrong? Did you want something else?\" They just handed me the check and I spoke up saying I didn't like it because it tasted burnt and bland to me to which the server responded, \"it's not burnt. It's like that because at stirfried.\" Like yeah.... I know what burnt is. I've had deep fried food that was stir fried before and it didn't have black marks on it and taste bitter.. and he's like you can talk to the manager. Like I've worked in restaurants as a server when I was younger and whenever I notice someone not enjoying their food I would ask about it and let the manager know they don't like it not just tell them to talk to the manager about it. So at this time I was upset I'm just like yeah whatever. The guy just walked away without getting the manager or anything. I had to walk up to the cash register to pay. He didn't say anything. All I got was \"sign here.\" I usually tip at least 20% on every meal and this is my first time not tipping. Customer service was horrible. I didn't even eat the food and just left it. Customer service and satisfaction should be their first priority rather than defending it and trying to make someone pay for something they don't like. So cheap! Felt so prejudiced against and then almost forced to pay for shitty service and a shitty meal. Go somewhere else for viet food.",

I'm not talking the usual pho or spring rolls, I'm talking some real, hard to find, authentic Vietnamese dishes that pho restaurants don't make/serve. Compared to some of the best places I've been for Vietnamese food (including Vietnam), it wouldn't be 5 stars, but for the valley? Definitely.   They have a fairly wide selection of dishes and everything that I have tried has been well made and tastes great. My boyfriend and I usually order #65 (steamed catfish in a hot clay pot), #72 (flash fried calamari), and my favorite #88 (sweet and sour catfish soup). I love that we can get full, but it's still a light full, not heavy and greasy. Nothing like some fresh Vietnamese food to get you feeling right!",

When we went in, there was a couple leaving and we got their table, the last table available. There were only a couple of people working in the restaurant, but they were very efficient in getting drink & food orders, answering any questions, etc.  After a glance over the menu, I knew I was in the mood for some fried rice so I decided to get a grilled chicken plate and substituted for fried rice. My date got the most filling pho soup per recommendation from our waiter. I'm not a huge fan of pho, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. He said he'd definitely recommend it since it was flavorful and had a lot of meat; like our waiter said, it was very filling. As far as the rice dish goes - my only complaint about the chicken is that it was a very fatty piece. The fried rice however was really good. When we go next, I'd ask if I can get just the fried rice because it was the best thing on the plate, along with an order of the egg rolls. I might try one of the stir-fry noodle dishes as well.  The food & service was good, so we'll be back here in the future!",

They always have fresh fixings with everything like mint, basil, cilantro and the jalapenos (with the pho)for all the dishes we get. Pho is huge and hot as hell and we are sweating and full when done. Everything has so many different flavors and textures and I love the variety. Employees are always pleasant and attentive to our needs and have made special requests(for kids because no kids menu) when needed. If you like bobas try the Thai one! YUM!",

The stem got stuck in my mouth. One meatball had a large piece of grizzle but the meatball itself was finely ground with great spices. Those little things didn't bother me. The price is right.

I had the #26 Semi-crispy flat rice noodles with beef, chicken, pork and mixed veggies (super yummy), husband had #24 egg noodles with beef, pork, chicken and veggies (good, but could have used a little more spices), sis had #28 rice vermicelli with grilled pork (the pork could have been a little more grilled to carmelize the meat, but yummy nonetheless). We were too full to have dessert but maybe next time, because there will certainly be a next time.",

    "text": "I found my new favorite Vietnamese spot.  Its cute, quaint and located in historic downtown Glendale.  Lots of businesses located in downtown Glendale are in charming historic homes.  The front patio had several plants and vines on the white picket fence gave the a feel of entering a secret garden.  Once your inside you can tell this was a home at one point, wood floors throughout.   The hostess has you sign in.   After a short wait we were taken to our table.  Our drink orders were immediately taken.  I got some hot jasmine tea and lemonade and my daughter cold jasmine iced tea.  My hot tea was brought out in a cute porcelean tea pot and tea cup.    We then placed our food orders.  We got veggie egg rolls, chicken fried rice and rice noodles with chicken and veggies.  The egg rolls came out first and oh my holy egg rolls were they good.  Fresh lettuce, cilantro, cucumber, basil and jicama to roll up your egg roll and then sweet fish sauce to dip.  Soo good.  Fried rice tasted like actually fried rice.  The noodle stir fry was also amazing.   This is a nice little hideaway to sneak away and enjoy great food.  After you eat you can also enjoy all the antique shops in Downtown Glendale.  Perfect Sunday date with my daughter!",

Now I understand being busy and not being able to seat us right away. But at least acknowledge that you see me and let me know with a hand gesture that you'll be over as soon as you can.  Now when we finally sat at our table in the front room where the register Is at...not like we were in the back and can easily be forgotten.  No one came over to ask what we would like to drink or to say hey I'm sorry for the wait we are short handed tonight and petty busy etc. We start to look around the room and the two other groups that were there only had their drinks and seam to have been waiting awhile already for their food. Another 15 minutes went by and still no one has come to take our order. So we wait about 5-6 more minutes. We were hungry and not wanting to wait any longer so we left. Again i completely understand being busy but all they had to do was acknowledge that we were waiting and let us know the wait for food will be longer than normal. All I can say is I won't be going back. And it's such a shame cause it's close to home and the food is pretty good but horrible customer service is a deal breaker for me.",

If you blink, you pass this puppy. We only found it cause we went one street too far wondering where we parked our motorcycles.  We're Veg, so we ordered from the Vegetable entree menu and split everything.  #78 Vegetarian coconut curry  - Awesome flavor although I hate white rice, it all meshed together beautifully.  #80 Flash-fried tofu with carmelized onions and tangy soy sauce - It's the sweet soy sauce that made this dish.  #84 Bok choy soup with ginger and onions - amaaaaazing flavor. Highly recommended. Tasted good for leftovers too. mmmm. mmmm  Price was hella right, peeps. Only $6.99 for each of these delicious dishes. Say wha?????  Cheap date night fer sure!  There were only like 2 servers so the service was a bit slow but very friendly.   As of  4/9/11, they weren't serving alcohol per a few posted signs. I assume waiting for a liquor license to come through.  Will be eating at this gem and recommending to friends every chance I get.",

Very mild green tea.  The app was my favorite part, very good! I loved the fried egg on the rice, and really, the rice was the example of what perfect rice is. The pork chop was very yummy. I tried the Hubby's steak and it was very good, and I love the deep caramel onions, wish there were more.  I wasn't blown away with the salad and sauce, Saigon Kitchen set that bar high for me.

We had a super sweet waiter who was very attentive. Their fresh spring rolls were good (and served in a cute little divided dish)  although a little hard to eat.. My filling kept falling into the peanut sauce. The Pho was good as well.. there wasn't a ton of beef in it but it was still filling and the price was right so it didn't bother me much. They offer a variety of imported beer options which is fun and their thai tea boba was delish. Definitely a neat little find while driving through Phoenix on the way back to Tucson. The prices were also the best I've seen for Pho in a while. I'd love to come back here.",

I appreciate the times she still came to check up on us, the food was very good, very fresh, and price was very good.  There's not a lot of good Vietnamese restaurants in Arizona, but this one is probably the best due to their consistency and authentic flavor.  Not to be racist but I also noticed Viet people cooking the food in the kitchen instead of Hispanics, which is a plus for me!",

My sister order the veggie rice noddle soup w/ extra chicken.  It smelled awesome, the classic Pho soup with all the veggies.  The taste was outta this world. Definitely coming back to this place.",

The place is not very big in size, which gives it that intimate dive restaurant feel. The courtyard/ patio in the front would be great for a group if you looking for a little more room.  This place is right in the heart of old town Glendale. Parking was not an issue at all when I went for lunch time. I parked in the thrift store parking then walked over. Seemed like a few others were doing the same thing as I noticed pulling up to the restaurant.   Once I got sat I noticed the menu was mostly in Vietnamese and had English translation as well. I wasn't sure what to order, as it was my very first time being here, or even to a Vietnamese restaurant for that matter. The server recommended the Pho, and a eves dropping customer also insisted that I try the Pho.   So I ordered the Beef and Shrimp Pho, along with some fresh spring rolls and  a Coors Light to drink. The Spring rolls where very different than what I was used to. They were extremely fresh wrapped in a weird film like texture of some sort. It was very delicious! The dipping sauce that comes with the rolls is perfect for the rolls. They bring out all the add in for the pho before the bowl of broth arrives. The add in consist of mint, cilantro, lemon, jalapenos, and some type of sprout root. Once I tried the Pho, I was blown away by out great it all was! It was actually really exciting and fun eating Pho since it was my first time. I can now see why everyone keeps recommending the Pho here!  What a great experience! I cannot wait to return here again.",

Loved the crunchy noodles!!!! I added some of the chili paste they have on the table just because I love it, but really it doesn't need anything else. The veggies were on point and although it didn't have many pieces of chicken I had so much fun enjoying the noodles I forgot their was supposed to be chicken on my plate. Haha!  My husband ordered a plate that had shrimp and chicken with a salad and rice. The rice is perfectly done and the chicken tasted good. You could taste the coconut oil which to me tastes amazing.  On a different ocasion I had the spicy chicken with lemon grass. When it came out it was served in a plate that was sizzling hot which means it will stay hot for a while since I talk to much. You can taste the lemon grass and whatever else they add to this. They bring some steamed rice for you and you can either pour the chicken on the rice or add the rice to the plate. I mean you can eat it however you want the outcome is the same! DELISH!  I ordered a limeade which on the menu it specifically says they make it there. It's good!  Haven't tried the rest of their stuff and will definitely go back to try different numbers on their menu!  Let me add it's not expensive either! Ha! Who doesn't like delicious food for a fair price! This girl!!!  Enjoy! Don't be scared to check it out!",

I had something with shrimp and chicken, and spring rolls and a Thai Iced tea with boba.  My companion had the yellow curried chicken.  His curry smelled so good, I wanted to cry. Then I tasted it.  It was amazing!   The spring rolls were literally the best I've ever had, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Why not 5 stars?  Only because I've only been there once.  It get's 5 stars if we drive all the way back to Glendale just to eat here.  we shall see. In the meantime, if you live anywhere near, go!!",

We are fans! We started out with the spring rolls. Not the deep fried kind but the fresh rolled kind, it had vermicelli stuffed with shrimp, herbs and grilled sliced pork. These are some of the best around. Most places just use the unflavored sliced pork, this was actually sliced,marinated and grilled. Made a huge difference in the taste. The only way it could be improved, would be the addition of some mint. The peanut sauce that it came with was good, different from the Thai peanut sauce I am used to but good. We ordered the regular iced tea. It was clear and refreshing. I usually order the salted plum or salted lemonade drinks whenever I have Vietnamese cuisine, but did not want anything with salt as it was so hot outside. I ordered the #38, it came with 3 grilled shrimp,a thin cut of grilled marinated pork tenderloin, white rice and an over medium egg on top. It had a few pieces of lettuce,daikon,carrot,cucumber, and tomato on the side served with a mini fried eggroll with minced pork inside.  They brought out the sweetened fish sauce to go with it  and I was happy with my selection. The pork was tender with a minimal amount of fat around the edges, and the shrimp was butterflied. The eggroll was not greasy and it was crisp. Overall I would order it again, but want to try something different next time around. My husband got the #56. Pork short ribs that fell off the bone, and shrimp served in a clay bowl floating in  a delectable peppery brown broth, with carmelized onions, and a garnish of green onions on top. Served with white rice on the side.The ribs tasted a bit like re heated meat, but the sauce/broth made up for it. The prices and portion size are just right. I would rather pay for good quality than quantity of food that other places dish out.  It is a bit hard to find. There are no big signs that stand off the road, we actually passed it then turned around. The setting is in what used to be an older home. They have a nice patio that I can see spending some great nights with friends outside in the early spring.  Inside, there are a few different rooms. Maybe a few tables in each room. The main room has tables to fit a larger crowd. We ended up in a smaller room to ourselves. I think it's a great place to bring a date without breaking your wallet. The place was very clean. Even the restrooms. That's a key right there. If the restrooms are dirty at a restaurant, guess how the kitchen must be?  We will come back to this place and I see it as becoming one of our favorites. The service was friendly and I would rather give my hard earned money to a family owned and operated restaurant than a chain any day! This would be a great place to start off dinner before going to the Glendale art walks or Glendale Glitters! Give them a try!",

    "text": "Okay, I'll admit it: one of the reasons I love going into any type of Eastern restaurant is because I'm still fairly ignorant of the cuisine.  Sure, I'll try just about anything, but half the time, I still don't know what it even is I'm ordering.  I really enjoy that.  The reason I bring that up is that there is SO much to try on the menu at Little Saigon.  It's a pretty sizable menu, and it might not be ideal for the indecisive.  Luckily, the size of the menu did not seem to diminish the skill at which it was prepared.  The appetizers looked like something out of a gourmet food magazine.  The main dishes (at least mine) was served literally still boiling and bubbling.  It all tasted as good as it smelled.  Oh, and since I seem to be addicted to trying new things, I'll advise you on this: the salted plum tea is actually surprisingly good.  While I'm no expert on Vietnamese cuisine, I'm sure I'll find myself back here soon to keep learning.",

However, awhile back I visited with family during lunch time it was not at all busy and we waited approximately 15 minutes to just be greeted and seated, another 15 mins or so for someone to get to our table to greet and order drinks and again 15-20 minute wait for food and the orders for a family of (3) didn't come out at the same time. My Brother's dish was forgotten about and had to wait again another 15 minutes or so.  During our visit it was extremely SLOW.  Many other patrons were also not greeted and waited a long time. I was surprised when this had occurred with the Owners who were both working at the time and on the floor.  I am reserving my thoughts a bit on how I feel about this place. It once was a great find to quickly turn into a bad experience. A shame when I had family who visited from out of state and we drove 16+ miles to dine here because I raved about it so highly.  This particular visit was disappointing. I've been back once after this and the service and food was very good. Perhaps a VERY OFF day for them.",

The Vietnamese cuisine is so good here too; it's incredible. My family and I recently went to Disneyland and stopped off in the actual \"little Saigon\" in Garden Grove California and ate at a couple of restaurants there. The food from Little Saigon here in Glendale was hands down better and the menu is more extensive. They offer far more selection than your average Vietnamese place. Also the spring rolls are about the best I've ever had. Try them and tell me I'm wrong. The Pho is always awesome. Get the #12 it has all the delicious bits you want! The vermicelli salads are perfect for a quick lunch or for an after dinner midnight snack (I usually order one to go after our meal, I'm fat, we like to eat, don't judge me). The crispy crepe is on another level of deliciousness. Packed full of mint, shrimp, pork, bean sprouts, served with daikon, carrot, lettuce, and sweet fish sauce. Roll it up in the lettuce, dip it in the fish sauce, and punch your ticket to flavor heaven. I will warn you this appetizer is the equivalent of crack cocaine. You will have to have more. You will find yourself driving not of your own accord to get your Vietnamese fix and it will begin with you mainlining some crepes and spring rolls. I'm an addict too so I know...",

Again...this dish also lacked flavor. Regarding the broth, it  had a watered down flavor.  The tendon had a strange almost sour taste.

I have really been struggling to find some really good pho out here in Arizona. Side note I moved out here from la (aka: city with the best foods) and I have been missing a good bowl of pho!  Ordered the chicken pho, veggie egg rolls, and dessert! I have to admit this was probably the best pho I have had In Arizona. Very quick authentic the broth was made to perfection. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it. Lol   If you're a pho addict/lover/enthusiast you have to stop by here and try a bowl! I promise you won't regret it! Customer service is great our waitress was very helpful and attentive. Menus are to the point short and sweet just how I like them lol",

    "text": "This is my first time in Phoenix, Az with my coworker on a business trip. After a long working day on August 15, 2018, we were hungry and had a crave for Vietnamese food. We searched Google and decided to try Little Saigon Restaurant in Glendale (Az). We arrived at the restaurant at 7:15pm, and ordered \"Pho Ap Chao #26 and Bun Bo Xao #32\". When the Pho Ap Chao dish came out, we noticed that the beef was missing, and politely asked the 2 waitresses \"where is the beef ?\" (because the dish should have beef, pork, chicken, veggie and semi crispy flat noodle). Both waitresses said the beef is in there but my coworker could not find any beef in the dish.  So we asked the elderly Vietnamese owner of the restaurant, also politely, the same question \"where is the beef?\".  The owner yelled back with a loud voice, in Vietnamese, \"I am the owner and been here for 13 years with no complain until now and don't come back\".  We were stunned and speechless by his bad attitude response in an uneducated manner.    So Beware and take your chance of encountering BAD service and attitude from this restaurant owner.  There are many other Asian/Vietnamese restaurant with 4-stars plus rating nearby!  We will not come back!",

This young woman wanted to walk in and sit at an empty table instantly and not wait 5 minutes. She's obviously used to fast food counter service. This is a top shelf restaurant, famous for their fresh dishes and blessing us all with some very capable and kind waiters. When Elza started to demand to sit down, the waitresses were flat out covering more tables than they should already.   Elza, when you dropped some attitude and stormed out, you really missed out on a fabulous meal. I recommend #22 next time, when you have the time to savor the best food and service in Glendale.",

Loved the broth and the fresh veggies that came with it for garnish. I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. Can't wait to come back and try some other dishes I saw other patrons get.

There are not to many Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to with atmosphere so that's an added plus.  The food is also great too.  If you love Vietnamese food you have to try this place.  If you haven't had it check out their website.  There you will find the menu and pictures of some of their food items.  Huge menu!  They don't have Vietnamese sandwiches here though.  They have a family member with a restaurant off I-17 and Bell to get your banh mi fix.  I have had the rice flour crepe with shrimp, pork and bean sprouts.  It is served with a plate of veggies.  It fills up the plate!  I also had the famous #37 with grilled pork, shrimp, egg roll and sunny side up egg.  Really good.  You'll see why it is so popular.  I also had the Pho with sliced beef.  It was not the best I ever had but very, very good.    The service is pretty good here.  The second time I went there they were fairly busy so I had to wait a short time to get seated.  The other two times they were pretty quick.  Servers were all friendly.     It is a good drive from my house but totally worth it plus It's in a great part of Glendale.",

My word of mouth for Little Saigon is get some of this food in your mouth.  I was with Mark R. today, but I may bring my wife here on a date.  The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable.      I did the goi-cuon-chay and then mi-xao-me.  I asked then to make the stir-fry noodles (mi-xao) extra spicy, but it was medium at best. The red chili paste on the table made it easy to add heat, so no problem there.    Digression: The spice issue brings out one of my double standards.  I want authentic ethnic food but, not authentic atmosphere.  Anyone else who has been outside the resort in a third world country should agree.    To the point Little Saigon was bright clean and comfortable and the food was great.  Fire up your GPS and come on down!",

The broth actually had enough flavor that I almost didn't have to add the extra garnish, but of course I did anyways. It was salty, tangy, and just a little bit sweet. The beef was cut up into manageable pieces and there were tons of rice noodles. We had spring rolls and a strawberry boba smoothie that were equally good.

When we (3) first entered the restaurant, no one greeted us and there was a party of 10 and 2 in front us. Many people showed up after us, so it seemed that the restaurant was popular. After 25 minutes, the party of 2 left while the party before us waited an hour before they were seated. And yet even after they had just been seated, a party member had to grab the menus themselves from the front because of the lack of service. If a restaurant receives as many high reviews, then high quality service has to be accompanied with it. I don't care if the food supposedly tastes good. If the servers don't even apologize, let alone acknowledge you, why bother?",

I ordered #1 Cha Gio:  Deep-fried egg rolls filled with ground pork.  Dip those yummies in the sweet fish sauce, I am gravy!  These were good, but I still preferred the \"normal\" size egg rolls.  Then I got #8 Pho Ga: rice noodle soup with shredded chicken.  The soup base is pretty good, plenty of noodles and cooked to the right texture, and the shredded chicken not fatty so excellent.  I also ordered the soy bean milk.    All in all I like the place and the food, but it is on the pricey side for Vietnamese food compared to other places.  Oh the service there is great.

First off I love the location and the old restored house where the restaurant is made into. The service has always been good. It's a very nice and quaint feeling instantly when you walk in.   I've tried several items but my personal favorite is the catfish in the black pepper pot with a side of white rice. I've must have had this at least 10 times and I wish I could have it more!! The pepper sauce is amazing and the catfish is tasty.   I've also had the pho and it was also very good.   All in all Little Saigon is one of if not best Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. My personal favorite. I can't wait to go back!",

My sister got the Strawberry which wasn't so bad, so as for the boba drinks I don't recommend them but as for the food, that part they got it covered :)",

Keep in mind, I hate seafood, I don't enjoy the taste, the smell, and I definitely don't like how sick it makes me. Being a Vietnamese restaurant, I knew my options were limited. I hinted to leaving but I lost that battle (thankfully).   We started off with Vegetarian Egg Rolls that were better than most places.   I had chicken Pho (7)  and my bf had a chicken dish (52)  My Pho was AMAZING. I was smiling the whole time and kept uttering, this is AMAZING. I wish he enjoyed his dish as much as I enjoyed mine.   While we were waiting another party politely asked how long it will be. He snapped and said \"maybe 10 min, maybe 30, I don't know when people are leaving\"  That was enough to make me want to get up and leave. I did not like how he talked to people. When he was seating us some lady gestured that she needed something and he rudely dismissed her.  Once we were seated all the staff was super friendly, but until you are actually at a table they can be quite rude.   5 for my food   2-3 for service",

The staff came and offered to show me how to roll them (I've done it in the past so I declined).  My wife's noodle dish was great. She may have got pad thai but I forget. And the boba is great and has many flavors to choose from.  On our next trip we ordered the firepot soup to split and again... filling. Fair price. Good food. Definitely worth a trip into downtown Glendale.",

Anything you get on the menu I guarantee will be great. I highly recommend the spring rolls on the appetizer section, it looks like a condom with a bunch of veggies and shrimp and beef stuffed inside but it's amazing! Also if you have never tried pho before this is a great place to do so. I love seafood so I always get the shrimp and beef pho and it never disappoints me. Customer service is great! They are always on their toes to make sure you are pleased! This place absolutely deserves a 5 star. It's a must try!!!",

Our server spoke perfect English and was very knowledgeable about the menu. The menu is huge (about 100 items- you order by number) so it can be a little confusing understanding the differences between even just the soup cboices! In the end we all ordered soups and they were very large portions but chock full of noodles and meat and a good size plate of veggies to toss in. It was a lot of food! And very good! It's a small restaurant but we didn't feel crowded at all and enjoyed our view at the window. The only down side for me was that I'm pretty sensitive to different foods etc and I got pretty bloated later in the day. I'm gonna guess it was the salt in the soup. Next time I think I'll try one of the rice plates. ..they also looked yummy.",

If you order any dish with meat they will literally put like 3-4 slivers on your plate and pour on the veggies to make it look like more. I want my moneys worth! Pho broth is not as flavorful anymore either, seems like theyre not putting as much time into it. I dont know if its a new owner or theyre trying to cut costs but theyre one more bad dining experience away from losing us as customer forever. At least theyre spring rolls are still amazing...",

Usually I like to start eating pho without any added ingredients. But it clearly needed it right away. No matter how much sauce, lime, cilantro, sprouts I added I just couldn't find the flavor. I was surprised on the reviews and ratings on this place but we really didn't like it here. The customer service was great but the pho was disappointing. I will not be back.",

Finally we made our way to Little Saigon, and I couldn't be happier with the experience.  To start with, we has great service. The young lady that waited on us was friendly, knowledgable, and very helpful. She spent time explaining each dish and left me wanting to try a large part of the menu.  She never let my drinks go un-filled.  The food was fantastic! We shared the spring rolls and the sauce was excellent. The pork inside was tender and very flavorful.  I had the #14, rice noodle stew, and it was awesome. The beef was slowly cooked and very tender. It fell apart in my mouth! Very, very well made. It was so big that I had 2 meals worth of leftovers.  My boyfriend had the #48, which was breaded garlic shrimp with caramelized onions. He let me try one and, WOW! This was the best part. It was very hard to resist eating his entire meal.   Nicely done, Little Saigon.",

I was really hungry today and after I ate mine, I was still hungry. We didn't get appetizers though, and normally we do. The buns here don't have mint, and had less noodles than I expected. However, it was very good. The beef was perfectly cooked. The shrimp was a little over cooked but not to the point where it was bad. I enjoyed it and I will be back.   Their Thai tea is less sweet, with a stronger tea flavor but it was quite enjoyable and it was $3.   The honey got the pork and shrimp bun. I'm assuming because he inhaled it, that it was good.   My oldest got the Pho with rare beef. She ate the entire bowl. Holy pho. She said it was great. I didn't have the chance to try the broth but it smelled good.   Our youngest wanted noodles and got soft noodles with veggies and chicken. She was quiet, so that means it was delicious. This was our first time eating inside. The honey got it to go last time. The staff was nice enough and didn't talk a lot. Overall, if you don't want pad Thai, come here. It's very good.",

I had #3 potstickers and they're the real deal, house made and golly they're good.  #9 pho was amazing with a heaping pile of super fresh sprouts, basil, cilantro, peppers and limes to add in to suit your taste.  Chicken pho was tasty too.  Our companion enjoyed #31 Vietnamese chicken bowl and thought it was outstanding.",

    "text": "What a find during my ongoing Vietnamese food trip - a Vietnamese restaurant which, unlike the others I've been to, is located in a charming converted little home rather than in a run down strip mall.  But the food is just as good or better, and with run-down-strip-mall-eatery prices. Their banh xeo (crispy rice crepes stuffed with beansprouts and shrimp) is awesome, and the generous seafood soup with white asparagus is something I'd order even on a hot day.  One of my favorite Vietnamese dishes is rice vermicelli with shrimp and pork or beef, and while their version is not as bold in flavor as Dong A's, it is definitely quite tasty. The courteous service complements the brevity of the wait between placing your order and receiving your food.",

The food selection is great, and from what we've ordered: Each were delicious and of great quality. The prices were affordable, and that's a great plus considering the quality! Most of my attention went to their desserts. The fried banana with ice cream was wonderful~! Definitely recommend!  The only reason why I give it a 4-star instead of a 5-star, is that the quality of the food I've had (cubed steak cuts and stirfry beef), while great, isn't astounding in their flavors - I've had similar in other restaurants, and I've had better in rare other restaurants. Perhaps I should order more foods to see if they stand out in some items more than others. Perhaps next time I'll order an item they're well known for. By no means should you think a 4-star is a bad or unspectacular rating. It's an excellent restaurant for everything it advertises itself to be.",

    "text": "I am an avid fan of Vietnamese Rice Noodle... I can eat this noodle soup everyday! At least once a week or more, I go to Pho602, or the one near in Bethany Home Rd. and 43rd Ave. in Phoenix. Being said so... I am very familiar how it should look like, and what are the stuff I should expect in my Vietnamese Rice Noodle. My wife and I decided to eat in LITTLE SAIGON in Down Town Glendale, AZ for a Rice Noodle and Fried Noodle. PROS: 1. The place is clean. 2. The servers are very welcoming. 3. Quick Service.  CONS: 1. The first thing that you will see in the entrance is the FILTY AQUARIUM that if you look into it, you will lose your appetite right away... (Too bad, I love aquariums and I know the difference between clean and filthy aquarium)  2. I was expecting a lot in my Rice Noodle bowl since it is more expensive than Pho602. It was $9, so this young lady bringing it from the kitchen, from a far I was so happy because it was HUGE BOWL, but when she put it in the table, IT CONTENTS ONLY HALF OF THE BOWL! NO TRIPE, MEATBALLS ONLY 2 PIEACES, RICE NOODLE NOT ENOUGH, BEEF SMALL AMOUNT COMPARED TO Pho602 and the one near Bethany and 43rd Ave. When you order XL it is really XL and you can expect so much stuff inside your bowl! Tripe, beef meat, beef ligament, lots of noodle to enjoy for only $7.50!  3. My wife ordered fried noodle and it was $10, so I was expecting something really good, like amount wife and ingredients will be more. But unfortunately, IT WAS TOO DRY, THEY JUST BASICALLY PUT LOTS OF VEGETABLE, NOT THAT MUCH OF MEAT.  IF YOU WANT TO GET A QUALITY VIETNAMESE FOOD FOR THE PRICE YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR, SAVE YOUR SELF FROM THIS PLACE AND DRIVE FEW MILES AND GO TO PHO 602 or the one near Bethany Home Village and 43rd Ave.",

The spring rolls had grilled pork instead of the normal boiled pork served everywhere else which provided more flavor    The bun bo hue broth lacked flavor but had lots of meat.   The bo lac loc portion was very small. It came with one scope of rice with about 8pieces of beef. I do not recommend.

    "text": "Once upon a time, I was a big fan of Little Saigon.   And then my girlfriend and I started trying other Vietnamese Restaurants and have kind of forgotten about them over the years. Honestly, I wasn't quite sure just precisely why we had forgotten, until a recent refresher visit helped to remind me.  The menu is what you'd typically expect, which is always a bit overwhelming and confusing if you're not familiar with this style of food. I've always found that Vietnamese restaurants are the type where I'm very happy that Yelp pictures are available to give you an idea of what you're getting into.  During our recent visit, my fried rice dish just tasted off, having this weird, funky flavor that I can only describe as being like a greasy and dirty grill. My girlfriend's chicken slab was tough, difficult to cut, and just simply not very good in comparison to what we're used to. Maybe it was an off night in the kitchen? I recall the food being much better. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and maintain that if it's a good night, you'll be pleased.  For desserts, they offer a fried banana that comes with some vanilla ice cream. It can range from very good to just okay, depending on whether the ice cream is at the \"freezer burn\" stage or not. They also offer snoh, but given its current popularity and comparing it to other places, we were quite disappointed, mainly due to the incredibly stale mochi balls.  Okay, so maybe I'm being a little too hard on them. Vietnamese cuisine has picked up a bit in recent years in Phoenix, which probably factors a bit into my overall rating.  It's (usually) good based on many of our past experiences - but you can definitely do better if you know where to look.",

Started with two fresh spring rolls served with pork, shrimp and rice noodles (Item #2 on menu). We saw some other diners having a large rice flour crepe with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts (Item #4). We ordered that.  Server instructed us on how to prepare it. We also had cubed ribeye and onions #47 in a sweet soy sauce. Last entree was a spicy chicken stir fry with vegetables #54. Great flavors, excellent service and  reasonable prices.",

My wife commented that the shrimp had no flavor with some being tender and some being very hard. The fried rice served with this dish was at least good.  My dish was alas also very lackluster. The broccoli was undercooked very hard as were the carrots. How can you undercook carrots that are sliced an eighth of an inch thick? I tried cutting off the stems of the broccoli but even the florets were tough. The saving grace was the beef. It was very tender and the sauce was good, combined with the steamed rice (which was well cooked) saved this from being a one star review. I might go back to try some of the Pho dishes which seem to receive  some good reviews. Though it  will be some time before we return. I don't know how to post pictures to show all of the broccoli stems I cut off to try to at least eat the florets.",

    "text": "Today I found a slice of heaven in Old Town Glendale. I had an appointment just a block away and was so excited to try this place. Parking was right on the street out front and so simple to find. Located in an old home it fit right in with all the awesome spots in the neighborhood. I got there right at opening and was greeted with a smile right away and able to chose my table. There were already quite a few people ordering inside. There are tables  in two different large rooms inside as well as some sitting room outside. It was a bit too cold for me so I opted for a table inside. I ordered some water while I looked over the menu and quickly saw they had a taro smoothie with boba and instantly knew I had to try it. So glad  I did because it was amazing! The flavor was spot on . I decided on the pho ga or chicken pho if you're unaware of what pho ga is. I was a bit bummed because I wanted to try some egg rolls, but was told they only come in a order of six rolls. You can get two spring rolls, but if you're looking for egg rolls bring a friend or a big appetite. There's always next time. My food came out quickly and the bowl was HUGE! It had so much flavor! Tons of fresh veggies and they definitely did not scrimp on the chicken either. There were plenty of chopsticks and sauces on the table so I did not have to ask for anything. My waitress was very attentive and more and more people were piling in by the second. It was so great to see how many regulars they seem to have as well as how full they were on a Monday this early in the day. I enjoyed my lunch and never felt rushed. There were so many delicious dishes coming out and o can't wait to try them all. The restaurant was very clean and everyone worked great as a team. My only wish is hopefully one day maybe there is an option for a smaller order of egg rolls when dining alone. I will definitely be back with friends.",

Add some extra jalapenos on there, some sprouts and sauce and mmm...I need to stop writing this review. Making me hungry just thinking about it.  TIP: try the soda chanh mui (salted limeade with soda water) with the pho.",

Its set in this little ol house on Glendale and 57th ave in what appears to be a local hangout  Whats cool is that this place must have a huge following because the waiter new half the people in the restaurant.   The place is small on the inside it has two rooms.  We were in the first one as you walked in which had seating for about 20+ people it was pleasantly decorated and the beer and wine was clearly visible from our table.  They serve house wine and beer.  And yes you can get Vietnamese beer here.    We started our meal with the appetizer crepes.  The crepes were filled with yummy shrimp pork and rice noodles.  Our waiter showed us how to eat these as they come with lettuce leaves that you are supposed to wrap the crepe in add some veggies and dip in oil.  Messy But FUN!  and so so tasty.  The crepe was light and so were the fillings.  Don't be intimidated by the size of the appetizer which is monstrous because if you share its enough.    For my dinner I had the dumpling soup.  Which was just awesome.  The broth is fantastic.  The egg noodles perfect and the garnish was absolutely awesome.  It comes with mint leaves, bean sprouts and lemon.  My girl had the mix rice bowl with chicken,pork, and egg rolls.  Hers was so mouth watering and she had so much we took the other half home and had a midnight snack!  Now I haven't had Vietnamese food in forever and I was over joyed by the friendliness and comfort of this place.  We will be back.  I would recommend this for anyone wanted to try something that is a little different but very tasty.  You will be glad you did!  Lastly I dont know what this is a two cash sign price range.  For two dinners an appetizer and two glasses of wine we paid 26 bucks.",

It grows on me a little bit every time and I realized that ever since I haven't seen the bad server I had the first time, I've really liked it!  They do fantastic spring rolls, with a tasty peanut sauce and the presentation is much nicer than usual. Bun Cha and Pho Tai are two dishes I've had there multiple times and was really impressed. Cold, fresh veggies, quality ingredients, and great taste.   This is a family run business and it really shows with the pride they take in getting to know their customers, and efficient friendly service. The restaurant, being in a home, has a certain charm that I'm used to downtown and really appreciate. This isn't my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town, but it's up there with the best. I wish their prices weren't so high. They are at least a dollar more per item than anyone else.",

First of all, it's in a fun bungalow style house in old Glendale which just adds to its charm. Second, the family that runs it is awesome. You'll be greeted by Tony or Hui (not sure how to spell it) or John and they're all great people. They know us by now and we're always greeted like old friends. I've tried half the items on the menu, which is extensive and haven't found anything I don't like. My husband is usually stuck on #35 or #36 which are their rice noodle dishes. So good. We've introduced our friends to Little Saigon and I have one friend who will gladly drive from East Scottsdale just for the fried banana/ice cream dessert (which is a MUST, by the way). In all, I will always recommend this restaurant!",

It provides different flavors than Grand Dragon or Siamese Kitchen the Chinese and Thai restaurants I love on the west side. I can't wait to go back and try some other items.",

I like the price and food selection ranging from pho to noodles to shark fin soup (I must try it!). With so vast a selection, I find it hard to be on point with all dishes.   I asked for a recommendation and ordered what looked like the easiest dish to make. A thin slice of pork and beef, fried rice, and a side salad. The most intriguing was the salad with delicious lightly pickled vegetables acting as a dressing. I thought the fired rice was rather bland and greatly benefited from a healthy dose of soy sauce (WARNING: not fish sauce is in smaller sized soy sauce bottle). I also tried the potstickers (highlight dipping sauce), shrimp noodle dish, and spicy chicken rice dish our company ordered. All solidly good, nothing remarkable.",

The employees are very happy to answer any menu questions I've had about dairy, fish sauce, and other non-veg ingredients.  The entree sizes are quite generous, and the staff is so attentive.  Our glasses were filled each time they got about half-way empty.  Every server walking by asked us if we wanted more rice.  And when I got a to-go box, our server offered me extra rice -- how nice!  I work in downtown Glendale and appreciate a great local restaurant that's good for vegetarians and vegans (there are so few down there).  I'll definitely keep going back.",

For one thing the setting in the old house is great.  And it has a shaded patio out front.  I had a chicken dish with rice which came to my table still at a full boil.  I would have liked to try the egg rolls but 6 in an order would have been a full meal in itself.  The party next to me had an order of spring rolls and egg rolls and their comments were good.  I went in the middle of lunch on a Friday and it was almost at capacity but I was seated right away and there was some delay (maybe 5 minutes) in taking my order but the food came out in a normal time.  As in many Asian restaurants it is a family operation with the son of the owners being my waiter.  Being just over a mile from work I will be back again.    Parking in downtown Glendale can be a hassle at times, less than a block away on the NE corner of 57th Ave. and Glenn Dr is a lot that only gets full during special events. In fact the downtown area is small enough I would park there to go almost anywhere in the area, but I don't mind walking.",

Inside it's just as charming, as it appears to be an old house turned into a restaurant.  A couple things threw us off - wait to be seated, but put your name on the clipboard. Second - large fish in the fish tank that reads \"These fish are our friends, not food\"  Anyway on to the menu - great selection of various dishes. Prices are a $1 or $2 more than other Vietnamese places we've tried to far in Phoenix - I'll give that to the area. My wife had a grilled chicken and rice dish, which she absolutely loved. Dark thigh meat chicken (it's flavorful and moist - no chicken breast here) and a lot of it. Standard rice, tomato and cucumber with fish sauce.   I chose to have an egg noodle soup (mi sui co #20) with sliced pork, pork belly (small cubes of pork belly I believe), wontons and ground pork. Also had bok choy. Great flavorful broth that really hit the spot.   Staff was friendly if not a little overwhelmed - place was busy but not slammed and the two younger people working the tables seemed like they were struggling to keep up. We still felt well attended to. Five stars all the way for great food, great ambiance and fair prices. Will be going back before we leave town.",

I remember as a child they used to be located inside a mall. All the food on the menu is amazing. I've tried all their spring rolls, soups, noodle dishes, and desserts. I hope this place never shuts down its my favorite place to eat good Vietnamese food. However, will say that their customer service isn't that great at times. They are usually busy whenever I come in to eat. I usually order everything right when I sit down so we don't have to wait a long time for the waitress/waiter to come back around. I have eaten there so many times I know the whole menu so I usually know what I am going to eat before I even walk into the place. I highly recommend the spring rolls ( with extra peanut sauce), any of the soups, the salads, and I get the number #23 noodle dish sometimes. The frozen coconut boba or the fried banana desert dish is bomb too. Whenever I take people to eat there for the first time it becomes their favorite Vietnamese spot to eat at too. I have gotten family and friends addicted to this place as well. Whenever I am in town I always stop by to eat here, even drive across town to get here.",

    "text": "I love when I get brave enough to try new cuisines, and then they turn out amazing. Little Saigon, a little house I've overlooked for years, delivers in flavor, value, and probably nutrition.   The vegetables are that good.   I started off with my very first banh xeo, a crunchy crepe filled with bean sprouts and some shrimp. Unlike French crepes that you can simply dig into, this dish will crumble as soon as you touch it. Use it as filling for a lettuce wrap, and if you're quirky like myself, enjoy the liberal portions of fresh mint and carrots that come along with it. It's still weird to me, but I'd eat it again.   My main course was some beef over bok choi, which was prepared perfectly. I have never had bok choi this tasty, and I'd definitely recommend it. I think it's the number 57, which shows you how many options they have.   For dessert, I went with a taro boba. It was way sweeter than I'm used to...but hey, it's a dessert, so what could I expect? Overall, I was satisfied with a very affordable meal in a clean, stylish environment. I would totes come back.",

A very delicious taste. Shrimp was cooked perfectly not chewy. Peanut sauce is on point. I could eat just this for lunch and be satisfied. I did order the beef pho and enjoyed every drop of it. The broth is not not as aromatic as I am used to so maybe a first time pho eater would take to it. I like that it does come out piping hot which makes the first sip of broth just run through your soul. And that is an amazing feeling. Warms the tummy. The resteraunt is clean an cozy. Our waitress was very nice and extremely helpful. There is seating outside too. I will most definitely be back.",

I love the spring rolls with the peanut sauce that I could drink as a beverage if they would allow it. The #37 is my standard with marinated pork chop and grilled shrimp with a side of rice topped with a sunny side up egg. I thought it odd the first time with the egg on top but after enjoying the meal I couldn't think of the meal without it.  I love the pho as well but only during the winter months as soup in the summer never seems appetizing.   Trust me if you love Asian food varieties give this gem in downtown Glendale a shot and never look back",

And the fact that they do offer boba tea and an abundance of classic dishes should please any patron.  Now for the important part, the soup. There is only one size available, but it is the perfect amount. The shrimp was large enough and also detailed. The meat was also pretty big and cooked perfectly. The taste was so excellent.

They are way above everything else we've tried; in fact, they deserve to be in an entirely new category.  I would strongly recommend this place. Don't waste your money eating junk out of restaurants that are just tossing the same old garbage at you.   This is different and very good.  We had several appetizers, a couple main dishes, 2 beers and 2 glasses of plum wine and with a tip, got out of there for just under $50. If the awesome food doesn't convince you, maybe the cost will!  ;)",

One piece of advice --- do your homework on-line.  The menu is extensive and can be overwhelming once you sit down.  I had made my selection ahead of time using their website menu (I ordered #2 and #56 - HIGHLY RECOMMEND both) and by reading Yelp reviews.    The only negative thing I have to say is that the noise level was HORRIBLE in the 'banquet room' where we (group of 14) were seated.  I will never go back to Little Saigon in a large group as it was difficult to hear what the person sitting next to me was saying.  The noise seemed to bounce off the walls.  Also, be aware that if you are in a party of six or more they do not split the check and will not take more than one credit card.  Another reason to go in a party of 1 or 2.    Overall --- FIVE STARS",

    "text": "Happened upon this place today, mostly by chance, but it ended up being a good experience and definitely good food.   Tucked away in old town Glendale, this place is a little off the beaten path (it's not on the main drag) but not too far. It's nestled in a nice area set back slightly from the street, so you get less noise than the other places along the main drag (Glendale avenue). What stands out immediately though is the decor and the ambiance of the place. There's a large aquarium in the foyer with beautiful fish, and ornate wood floors and wall siding. The restaurant has several sections that are divided off with narrow door ways, to give a bit of privacy to different groups and, I suspect, keep the noise level down. The tables are also spread apart a bit, which has the same kind of effect. There's definitely much less noise pollution when you're dining with your guests, something that is hard to achieve in most restaurant settings. You legitimately feel like you're somewhere else and not the middle of the Arizona desert when step inside this restaurant.   Our group was immediately seated at a large table and our server was very helpful and patient with us, as we were all unfamiliar with much of the menu offerings. That's actually one thing that I would nitpick about, the menu has nearly 100 items on it and it can be a bit daunting for the uninitiated. With so many options, it's a serious mental exercise to balance the choices and figure out what sounds most appetizing. Our first challenge was the appetizer and following the server's recommendation, we tried the spring rolls and the egg rolls, all of which were fantastic, and quickly devoured. Everything was very well made and the spring rolls were fresh, crisp and simply mouth watering.   Our main entrees were pretty diverse, including the crispy noodles and a couple of their soups (including catfish) but everyone enjoyed their food. The crispy noodles were delicious and I especially liked how they wicked up the moisture from the juices in the bowl and softened up, so that you'd get a contrast between crunchy and regular noodles to go with the vegetables and meat (chicken and beef, in my case).   Service was fairly prompt, even though they were busy with the Friday lunch crowd and had fewer staff than I would have expected. Food service was also quick, with our meals coming out right on time as we polished off the appetizers.   Definitely a place I'd like to go back to, because there's just so much of the menu to explore and so many different things to try. Really glad I got a chance to try this place out!",

I only managed to get one dish, of course, but would be willing to try out more if I go back!  Those of you familiar with Com Tam entrees will know what this common restaurant dish is that I ordered. It was charbroiled pork with egg cake, pickled vegetables, broken Jasmine rice, and shredded pork. This also came with a bowl of Vietnamese fish sauce which I prompted doused my rice in because I love broken rice mixed with that sauce. The pork itself was delectable though a little tough to cut. They had sliced it up into attached strips, however, so that was easier than having to cut it all up myself. The vegetables were great but not as crisp as I would've liked. My complaint with the dish was the egg cake, which was too hard and condensed. It made me wonder if it had been sitting around for a little bit because of its texture. I only managed two bites of it before I called it quits. As for my drink, I had a Thai tea that I had asked for without boba but the waiter still put it in there...and it wasn't great at all. The Thai tea itself was delicious but the boba was disgusting. I avoided it by drinking from the top. My friends ordered pho so if I ever went back there again, I think I'd try that next.",

I always go there with my family, a group of four, and always tip them more than 18%. Last week I had family visiting us and I brought them there for lunch, since we had 13 people, the waitress told us that it was required to add 18% gratuity to the bill, which was fine for us, but they didn't have a table to sit all of us. Instead they separated us among three tables and told us that we couldn't split the bill. One table of my family didn't know that there would be 18% gratuity added and was trying to find out the reasoning from the waitress and the waitress started yelling at my family and the owner came out from the kitchen screaming that \"This is our policy\"! In my opinion, even if this is a policy that the customers should follow, the owner and waitress could have informed us in a polite manner. They should not expect their customers to return if they were treated in a way of unsatisfactory. One should know that there are more than just that one Vietnamese restaurant in Arizona.",

    "text": "The trek from Ahwatukee to Glendale is loooong, but luckily I have family in these parts, so we come here often.  Hands down, the best Vietnamese food I've had in the valley, no contest.  The place is a very small converted house, and truly, because of the size, you feel as if you are there for a friend's homecooking rather than at a fancy restaurant.  So small in fact, that if you have a large party (which they can absolutely accommodate, by the way) you should call ahead.  I know some people call this a pho restaurant (and the pho is good - not the best I've ever had, but good) but really, it is absolutely a Vietnamese restaurant first and foremost.  Given the extensive menu with a long list of homestyle dishes, pho doesn't take a backseat, but it's certainly not the star of the show.  The one thing that I love about Little Saigon is that every dish comes with copious condiments.  Cha gio (crispy spring rolls) come with mounds of lettuce, cilantro, mint, carrots and daikon with bright nuoc mam (fish sauce) for dipping.  All of the soups include cilantro, mint, basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno and lime - I will instantly dock points if I'm having pho and I don't get all of the above.  Plus, crazy good dishes like the Curry Catfish with Black Pepper Sauce (served on a sizzling plate for two) come with rice and lettuce for wrapping as well.  Favorites of mine are the Summer Rolls with tasty shrimp and bits of grilled beef, Bun with Grilled Pork, the Pho with Meatballs and the Caramelized Catfish.  Even the fried rice that my husband always gets is savory goodness.  One important thing to note, though the waiters are perennially friendly and bustling, and the owner/chef is fabulous, this is not the place to make special recommendations or changes to the dishes.  If you are a fussy eater or want things your way, 9 times out of 10, you will not win that battle.  We've been coming here a while, and have seen some interesting antics between the kitchen and the dining room.  Just order and enjoy, the food truly is so good, you shouldn't have to make special requests as it is.  Very very worth the trip to Glendale.  I'm jealous of you guys, west side!",

    "text": "I'm no expert on Vietnamese cuisine, but my first experience at Little Saigon made me want to learn more.  This place is wonderful, and you should try it next time you find yourself in Glendale.  The fun begins before you're even seated, as the restaurant is in a little old house.  The tables aren't jammed together and the artwork is eye-pleasing and relaxing.  Friend and I were impressed by the friendly, quick service.  But the food impressed us even more.  We had the potsticker appetizer, one of the best ever... not the sticky white dough typically found in a Chinese restaurant potsticker, these wraps are more like a thin French crepe, beautifully browned, filled with pork and veggies.  The dipping sauce on the side was delicious, though we also made use of the condiments provided at every table, namely fish sauce, sriracha, chili-garlic paste, and soy sauce.  We had two salads... #96, jellyfish salad with shrimp, pork, julienned  carrots and other veggies, and some herbs... and the #97, the lotus root and shrimp salad, also containing pork and julienned veggies.  Either salad could pass as a meal and we got the SMALL versions.  The flavors are off the charts on both, savory, herby, ginger, fennel, just delicious.    For entrees we got the #51, lemongrass chicken, and #55, bite size pork ribs with caramelized onions.  Both arrived at the table in clay hotpots, still bubbling, and were savory and satisfying.  We have resolved to go back to try the pho (which looked very good as we ogled our neighbors' tables) and other tempting offerings.  This place deserves the 5 stars, and your business.  You'll thank  me!",

Service was very attentive and friendly. Prices were also reasonable. We had entrees including Egg Noodle  Soup (Mi), Tofu Lemon Grass Hot Pot and Tofu Vegetable Curry. All were really great. They also had a cute patio out in front that I'd imagine at night would be pretty with the more residential street, trees and lights. Great place that we would return to again!",

    "text": "I admit it. I'm a romantic. Sometimes I give my heart away too easily to a handsome french fry here, or a buff egg roll there, only to have it broken on our second meeting. The french fry has gone limp, the egg roll greasy. That's why I forced myself to hold back after going to Little Saigon the first time. I had to see how I'd feel on our next date. Now I'm ready.  The place is really cute. It's in one of the little houses that make up much of downtown Glendale's shopping district. You'd expect to be served Irish stew or corned beef and cabbage here. There are lace curtains in the windows and potted fake plants scattered about. But the food is Vietnamese, and lots of it, too. You can order by number, or enjoy feeling foolish trying to pronounce the Vietnamese names of the dishes correctly - all one hundred and one of them. So far we've tried eight.  The dish that first delighted us was #62, bo cuon la nho ($9.99), This, of course, is marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves and served with rice noodles and \"paper\". It comes, as do many of the dishes, with a large helping of fresh-as-can-be romaine lettuce leaves, mint, thai basil, coriander, and sliced carrots and cucumbers. It it looks like you're going to run out of greens, the pleasant servers (none of them Vietnamese) happily bring you more. The beef is tender and flavorful, contrasting nicely with the brininess and chew of the grape leaves. On our second visit,  Ken ordered #55, black peppered bite-size pork ribs with caramelized onions ($6.99). It was served in a pot which came boiling to the table. The broth was delectable, flavored by the onions, and the ribs were falling off the bone with just the right jolt of pepper.  I decided to order two appetizers - egg rolls ($4.99) and banh xeo ($7.99), which are rice flour crepes filled with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts. The egg rolls were good, but not noteworthy. The crepes were delicious. I've had them at other places and they usually arrive at the table soggy from the filling. These were perfectly dry and crisp, despite the load of meat and veggies. Our friend Sue, who was with us on our first visit and happily came on the second, had the fried rice bowl ($6.99) both times, so we plied her with our goodies. I bet the next time she'll go with the ribs.  There are 10 variations of Pho, with rice noodles, and 5 more soups made with egg noodles. Then there are 6 hot pot soups. Many dishes are served over rice, and others with stir fry noodles. Catfish is done 4 ways and shrimp 3. There are 3 green mussel salads and 5 mixed salads including one with jellyfish. I could go on, but if you go on line, you can see the menu for yourself.  As I mentioned above, the servers are friendly and attentive. They actually remembered our names and what we had eaten on our first visit. We had directed other friends to Little Saigon that night, and the servers remembered them, too. The portions are large, the ingredients fresh. And there's even a cute patio. I think I'm ready to commit.",

    "text": "Been twice now. We are Pho-natics and have been to many Vietnamese places in Phoenix. Although not as good as Pho Trahn overall, this place is far better than most. What distinguishes it: service is very good, something that many Vietnamese places lack. Very clean, and has a relaxing patio (beware, they frequently have the patio closed however during the \"cold\" moths) and the ingredients they use are much higher quality. If you've been turns off by the fatty, low quality cuts used in Pho in other places, this is your place.   Also, while the Pho gets the most attention (Pho Bien and the pork/beef are excellent) the Hot Pot (K got the seafood) Soup was amazing. Very generous portion and almost sweet to the taste with a good amount of acidity. The Pho is very balanced in its broth but the hot pot is delicious if you're looking for something different.",

    "text": "This quaint little restaurant near downtown Glendale has been here for about 3 years, but has a long history in the valley in 2 other locations, including originally in Scottsdale. It is now in a converted house, with a little white picket fence in front. Cute!  There is a large fish tank at the entry, and then there are 2 seperate small dining rooms. Large wood beams go acros the ceilings. A tall, bald Causasian man took my order, but he knew Vietnamese food, and the cook is a little Vietnamese old lady, and she can cook!   This restuarant has all the usual dishes you would find in a place like this, from Pho (noodle soup) to Com (rice plates) to Bun (Rice vermicelli plates).   But I started with the Goi Cuon (spring rolls). 2 of them came on a single order, and were very large! Usually you get just 2 shrimps in each, but they had 3 or 4 shrimp in each! Lotsa veggies and pork, too! Served with a peanut sauce.   Instead of all the typical plates, I also went for one of my favorite appetizers again....Banh Xeo! Banh Xeo is a large crepe/omelet like half-crescent pancake, stuffed with bean sprouts, pork and shrimp, and fried to a crispy shell, sort of like a Dosa in Indian Food. For $6.99, I got two large Banh Xeo! Most places only give you 1, so this is a great deal.   It was tasty and crispy! They served it with the Romaine leaves to wrap up sections of the Banh Xeo into, along with the pickled carrots, daikon (white raddish), cilantro to stuff inside, and the Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) to dip into.   It is really messy to cook Banh Xeo, what with all the dough and frying, and it is perhaps more messy to eat it, as you wrap it in romaine with a bunch of veggies, and dip it into the Nuoc Mam, and then try to make it to your salivating mouth! By the end (I couldn't finish the entire 2), I advise you go wash your hands, or smell like Nuoc Mam for hours later!   PS - they offer Vietnamese 33 beer!",

    "text": "What makes Little Saigon so special is the quality of the ingredients. The meats are lean, the veggies are fresh. I am a huge fan of Vietnamese fresh spring rolls, which are not baked or fried. Filled with rice noodles, shrimp and pork these are a refreshing starter for any meal... they can be a meal on their own! I like the bahn xeo (which reminds me of a thin fritatta filled with bean sprouts). The pho is great with all white meat chicken (and I kick it up a notch with the hot sauce and hoisen which are already on the table)! When I'm not in the mood for soup, I like to get the vermicelli dishes and have tried most of them over the course of the past two years. Satisfied every time! This is a great spot for dinner before Glendale Glitters or any of the many other festivals that take place in downtown Glendale.",

    "text": "Little Saigon, such a quaint little place in [usually] desolate old town Glendale.   Weekends are reasonably busy here, but we came on a Thursday...and were basically the only ones there. Is 8pm really that late??? Come on, night owls, where are you?  Ordered the delicious spring rolls (as described in the review below mine). The sweet fish sauce is such a great complement for these things. Also had the egg crepe, filled with bean sprouts and shrimp. Bean sprouts were fresh, crisp...but the shrimp were a little overcooked. Piling the crepe onto a bed of lettuce, mint leaves, and lemongrass was so refreshing. You can eat so much of this stuff, and not feel guilty. Those were just appetizers.   Now onto the main course. I'm always indecisive about which soup I want, but I settled with the #12, which consisted of rice noodles in beef broth, beef and pork slices, tendon, tripe, and meatballs (consistency was similar to that of the meat in a gyro). With some generous dashes of sriracha, chili paste, and fish sauce, I was in another world. In addition, this lovely medley was served in a king size bowl. Thumbs up to that, and to myself... for finishing the whole thing.   Everyone I dined with was quite satisfied with their dishes, and I would have liked to share a description of each dish, except I was too consumed with my own bowl that I became oblivious of my surroundings about 20 minutes into the meal.   Towards the end, the endearing chef made an appearance and surprised us with dessert- on the house. Nice!   I enjoy coming here... very homey, and lighthearted people. I'll probably visit again this week!",

Needless to say both visits were positive, but my second visit was a close encouter of the delicious kind.  I ordered the Pho to go (yo) cause I'm a slave monkey for my company and not allowed to take a \"lunch hour\"   I tell the waiter \"extra meat for a buck please\" .  Not only does he NOT forget this like I figured he would,  he separates the meat into it's own little lifeboat so it doesn't cook itself to leather in da broth.  Massive, massive shibby my man.    And such extra meat he gave! (in a very hetero way I assure you).  This was one of the only times I couldn'y finish my Pho off.  Usually I'm bitching and moaning like a 4 year old on ADD meds, but this time I was supremely satisfied and not dissapointed in the carne content of my soup.    Rock on Saigon.
