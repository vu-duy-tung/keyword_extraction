On more than one occasion in the past month we have arrived to find the restaurant closed in contradiction to business hours.  There has just been a printout on the door saying \"we're closed please head to the Melrose location, mention this and get 20% off your order.\"  By the time I've been disappointed in my decision to choose a closed restaurant for my meal, I am certainly not interested in traveling to another location.  I want something close and convenient (like this location).  So now we're still fans, just only during weekdays, which seem to be the only days they're open.",

The marinated pork was moist and tasty, reminiscent of Chinese roast pork (char siu), it was piled high with all the typical fixins, but the grilled pineapple was what put it over the top. So yummy, there's no need to put salsa on it.    The special cerviche that's only available Fri & Sat, was awful. Tasted more like they served it the week before. Decor could use some sprucing up and beware of the bees if you plan on dining outside. Even though the ambiance and cerviche were below average, I'd take a drive to get more Vampiro Pastor.",

The bean and cheese burrito is delicious if you're looking for a meatless option. Daily specials, reasonable prices, and a good happy hour. My only complaint is that the tortilla chips aren't very good--often taste a little stale. If you get them, make sure to get the spicy salsa. It's not that spicy and it's a big improvement over the regular salsa. The \"cochata\"--coffee + Horchata--is awesome!",

I didn't consult the yelp reviews first of what to order, but decided that I may as well try a few tacos since that's the name of the place. I had the Carne Asada taco and the El Pastor taco. Of the two, the El Pastor was (IMO) wow!! I loved the sweet flavor of the pork. The carne asada was definitely alright but not as tasty as the El Pastor - - get that if you like/eat pork.   Chips and salsa - - $1.50. We did get one friendly refill.   But... today was one of those perfect weather days in Phoenix, where it's basically required to eat outside. So Jack and I enjoyed some rays out on their patio - - it was awesome! I felt as though I was back in Southern California somewhere.   Yeah... a bit on the pricey side for a Mexican taco joint. $1.50 for a can of soda.... my total for soda, chips & salsa, and 2 tacos was $8.50. Oh well... I enjoyed it!",

In one word how would I describe? \"Overrated\"  Can't believe I've read some reviews saying you get a lot of food for the money. Where do some of you eat where you walk away barely full and have spent over $20 on so so fast food and call it \"cheap\" and \"large portions\"?",

Thought the prices were a bit high for the quality and amount of food that I received.  The ceviche and tortilla chips that came with it were a bit bland.  The carne asada taco was good but not spectacular.  What got me though as I sat indoors in their dining room was I started to notice how dusty everything was.  There was a grimy layer of dust over all the decorations on the walls and the tops of the condiment bottles were frankly disgusting like they had not been wiped in ages.  So I decided to check out their bathroom.  Sure enough, the ladder they had leaning against the wall had a layer of dust on them . . . .   and I felt a little grossed out . . . let's just say, if the public areas like the dining area and bathroom are not clean and well care for, I don't really want to imagine the condition in the kitchen . . .",

    "text": "I'll have to agree with my brother, and fellow reviewer, Ryan B. that the portions here are tiny. I ordered a $4 Vampiro, which was a flat, 1/2 taco shell covered in carne asada, cheese, and some green salsa. I didn't expect a full meal, but more that a half of a taco. I also ordered the ceviche, which is AWESOME! Served with a tiny potion of salsa, this ceviche is fresh and tasty! They only make it on Friday and Saturdays, which is why I only go to ATS on those days. Service is so-so. The staff doesn't look too thrilled to be there and have never been overly friendly. My biggest complaint is a can of soda is $1.50!! That is crazy! I am not a cheap person, but I really cannot stomach paying this much for a can of Diet Coke. I usually stop at a gas station on the way back to work to buy a soda because I cannot justify paying that much for a soda.",

When left unsupervised, as I was this weekend, I forgot to do somewhat important things (i.e. eat meals, shave, feed the fish...).  With that being said, on Saturday night after a day of working around the house, I realized that I was out of wine, and on my way to Safeway, I saw America's Taco shop was open.  I got a few bottles of wine for the night and went back down 7th, and got to America's seconds before 8pm.  Yes, they do close at 8pm on the weekends.  They gladly took my order and I sat and waited.  I always HATE being that guy who comes in right at close.  Thankfully, a couple came in close to 8:15 and they were just as nice to them as they were to me.  The owner/husband (I presume) came out and made small talk with me, and was very nice. Anyways, I digress.  I got the Carne Burrito, and the flavor was amazing!  I asked for the Pico on the side and got a good size portion of it.  I will be going back for more!  I want to try everything on the menu like Dyl W did.   If I don't forget to eat again today, I'm going to get the tacos.",

Inside it was crowded with a long line to order.  Most items are available in regular and XL size. I went with a regular vegetarian quesadilla $3.75 and \"Americas corn\" 2.50, and was then given a number for my table.  My quesadilla arrived and it was much smaller than I expected and less cheesy, but the sauteed onions were good. The Corn is just a corn on the cob, covered in mayo and then some shredded cheese. Each dish comes with a small piece of cucumber and radish.   On the table there is a large selection of hot sauces however they did not taste fresh to me.  My co workers got the carne asada and they liked it.  They have a 2-6 happy hr with $1 tacos cheap chips and beer I may try it again for a late lunch.",

I ordered the large bean burrito. Duh.   It was everything they described it and more. Tortilla was grilled perfectly and the tasty beans oozed profusely from the burrito. The salsa it came with was okay but kind of bland. But it wasn't really needed. The burrito tastes like the ones my Tio used to make at the restaurant he owned in Santa Ana when I was a little girl. Definitely took me back.  Oh, and the beans are VEGETARIAN. Yes, it is possible to make tasty, authentic refried beans that are not swimming in pig fat!!! Please take note other Mexican restaurants. You can get a whole new clientele by eliminating lard. After tasting America's beans there is no excuse not to make yummy beans without lard.  Last time I went I also ordered their street corn. It was heavenly. Cheesy, buttery goodness with a hint of lime. The hot sauce it comes with is great, but beware, it is a creeper.  Employees are great, and always seem happy to see you.

    "text": "\"Home of the Greatest Carne Asada in the Valley\" is a pretty bold statement for a restaurant to make in a city where there is a taco shop on just about every street corner.  For me, good carne asada is all about the quality of the meat, marinade and cooking method. These are the qualities that separate America's Taco Shop's carne from others around the Valley.  Located in a charming little old house along Seventh Street, you'll find that this place is just cute as a button. In front, there is a patio and covered bar stool seating on the porch. There is parking out back as well as along Monte Vista to the north. But don't park in Coronado Cafe's parking lot they'll have you towed.  Inside are hardwood floors and an old fireplace. There's definitely a homegrown feeling here, like some of the other homes turned restaurants. It's so Phoenix.  Ordering is all about counter service, so you place your order, they hand you a number card and you find a seat.  Carne asada is the name of the game here, and while the beef-centric menu has only a handful of items, there are a few vegetarian options. Some of these include a Bean and Cheese Burrito in two sizes ($3.25/$5.75), America's Corn ($2.50) and a Vegetarian Quesadilla ($3.25). When available, America's Corn is a cob of sweet white corn, slathered with mayo, then sprinkled with cotija cheese, chili and lime. What a great way to get your whole grain and fiber.  On Friday and Saturday, America's Taco Shop features Ceviche ($5.95), but unfortunately it was marred by a strong shrimp flavor. Chips and salsa ($1.50) were good, with a nice balance of salty crunchiness and a little kick with the house-made salsa.  Now for those of us who love the meat, we're hoping for the \"Greatest Carne Asada in the Valley.\" With such high expectations, does America's Taco Shop statement hold True?  In all of its beefy glory, America's carne asada is set apart by using high quality well-trimmed meat. I tried each conception on the menu, twice, and not once did I bite into any gristle or fat. I got mouthfuls of tender, flavorful chopped beef.  The Torta ($5.95) was expertly prepared, taking toasted bread and covering with mayo, guacamole, jalapeno, lettuce, tomato and heaps of meat. Another variation is called the Vampiro ($3.25), a crunchy grilled corn tortilla with melted jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce and caramelized onions. In reverse is the Taco de Carne Asada ($2.25), with less cheese and served on a fresh corn tortilla. Both hit the mark with plenty of tasty meat.  The Carne Asada Burrito ($5.45/$$7.95) is simple, yet amazingly fantastic. A flaky grilled flour tortilla is filled with like the others chopped beef, guacamole, pico de gallo and caramelized onions. It's that perfect mix of fresh chewy flour tortilla and tender meat that makes this one of the best carne asada burritos I've had in a long time.",

Typically this isn't my style of fare, but I DID enjoy my beef taco with just meat and cheese.  The restaurant is in a beautifully restored historic house (as is typical of new CenPho venues). They have a little outdoor patio over looking 7th Street which was way cool.  One thing that I think should be stressed is that this aint cheap. They sell bottles of Mexican Coke for $2.50, the tacos were like $2.25 each, and chips and salsa were an extra charge.  Still yet another great addition to CenPho!",

No bell pepper. No mushrooms. No cilantro.   Dining experience- outdoor area was pleasant.  My husband ordered 3 carne asada tacos because they are \"The best in town\". Tacos were skimpy on the meat which was fine with me because I want him to quit meat anyway.  We came here because of the Check Please episode. Sadly, it wasn't worth it. I didn't even eat all my food nor did I take home leftovers.....that never happens.",

I live in an America where people are humane to other people (most of the time)., not here, my party of 6 witnessed the owner escorting a middle age woman in here 40's out the door and asking here to sit on the patio, 109 that day. THE OWNER!!. I caught him as he had her halfwaty pushed out the door like a puppy who had chewed a sock. I stop him and politely aske dhim if she could sit with us and i would by her meal. He stated \"there are no seats in here\", the restuarant was about 60% full at the time. I showed him a 2 two next to our table, he reluctantly agreed. I got the young lady situated and went up to order for her. He called me into a side room and was upset that I intervined, he said that this person had vandalized and broke into his business on several occasions and it was on video, he pointed to a window about 5 ft above the floor and statd that she had got in there..Keep in mind the woman is wheelchair bound and disabled in many aspects. I asked if he had called the police and had her arrested, he story began to unravel at this time. He backtracked and began to get irrate, raising his voice and choking up. He really had zero proff that this homeless, disabled, mentally challanged woman was the actual one that entered his business after hours. He had a vendatta against all the unfortunate street folk in his neighborhood. He also tried to add that he was going to buy her something to eat which was a flat lie, when were you gonna do that?, as you pushe dher back out into the street? He called the police and stated that he had an unruley customer. just think if every business owner called Phx. PD becasue of a unsatisfied customer!! I offfered to wait for the cops to show and even was wwilling to give him my name. He is a business owner that is after only one thing: MONEY!!  I dont think he liked my questions and I continued to state that I still wanted buy something for the woman. He followed us out into the parking lot to continue his sissy-type sniveling stating that I should not have done what I did. NEWSFLASHNANCY BOY, I would do it again today, maybe you should walk in her shoes for just an hour, I pray that you or anyone in family has too, By the way you food wasnt all that bad, very light on the meat but good. American Taco? maybe should be just AMERICAN-I-ONLY- WANT-YOUR-MONEY-AND-HAVE-NO-SOUL-TACO,  first and last time to this winey owned taco shop......take care of each other out there...",

However, I love the watery guac and at 25 cents a side mixed it with those watery beans and add some salt MMMM. The steak is cut to perfection, but lacks flavor. THe tortillas are soft, but the portions are also very small. Also the sodas are really expensive I think our bottle of coke was $3.00 granted it was a bottle but still??

And they're still working on the liquor license thing. And a couple of other just-open restaurant quirks. Luckily, they are extremely excited and eager to please.   Their Mexican waters were unbelievable (go with the Tamarindo), and big gulp sized. The corn was awesome as well. All grilled up and slathered with mayo, cotija cheese and hot sauce. I also ordered a quesadilla vegetariana, which could have stood a bit of flavor (the owner went to get salsa, but never came back...seriously), but was not at all bad. Next time I'll try their bean burrito, which is made without any lard in the mix.  The price is right, and they're right around the corner, so I'll definitely be back.",

They informed me that tacos were on special and that by ordering 1 more taco, I would actually be paying less.  I did, and got a carne asada taco as well.  They were freaking delicious!  We also got the ceviche and guacamole and salsa, all equally as good.  If you are looking for unique drink, try the cochata.  (horchata mixed with coffee)  it has quite an interesting texture, but was good.  It was a bit pricey, but I think if I had just stuck with the tacos, and skipped all the extras it would have been quite reasonable.  Enjoy!",

We ordered two carne asada burritos, chips and salsa, the corn everyone raved about on Yelp along with two carne asada tacos. The burritos were a decent size. I was disappointed that there wasn't more than a small dollop of guacamole at one of the burrito. The meat was lean and flavorful however tasted very charred. Some of the inner pieces tasted good though the meat was seasoned with too much salt. The meat was lean and tender.   Chips and salsa were okay. I love it when a restaurant heats up the chips - this place does not. The salsa was fresh tasting and not overly spicy. Neither my husband nor I liked the corn. It is corn on the cob dipped in a mayonnaise sauce with Mexican cheese sprinkled on top. It is garnished with a hot sauce and limes.   Whoever mentioned the small side portions of the lime, radish and cucumber were dead on. The lime was so tiny I didn't get more than a drop of juice from it.   The servers were friendly and it is an easy place to take your children as long as your total party does not exceed four. The place is tiny but decorated nicely.",

With all the hubbub about immigrants these days, its sad to say that this place (amongst many others) wouldn't be here if it weren't for the blessed peeps who come over here and share not only their love but food and culture with all of us gringos who don't got nothing! I love the patio, I'm just missing the beach in front of me (instead of 7th street), especially because I've got a negro modelo in my hand, munching on some chips and (AWESOME) salsa.   I ordered a carne asada taco and one cob of America's corn. Both were delicious! Although I was stuffed with it all, I think I could eat at least two tacos, they're pretty cute and small. The corn was amazing and the sauce the came with it was kind of sweet at first but by then end my mouth was on fire (in a good way). I LOVED IT! Jose got the quesadilla with carne. It was also delicious but small for $6. That was his problem \"I paid $6 for that small thing, I could make it at home\". Which, yes, is True but you didn't and its yummy.    The staff we're friendly and genuinely nice. Great music was on the speakers and it was extremely clean. Everything taste and smelled fresh and it just felt very comfortable.  Saturdays & Sundays they have $2 pacificos, ALL DAY! I've got a girlfriend coming into town in a couple of weeks, I guess I know where we will be hangin out at.  Thanks America!",

The recipe (an old family one of the owner's) is amazing and very flavorfull.  Try the burrito, but get something on the side as it needs an extra bit to fill you up. Don't get me wrong this is not the Overstuffed Burrito that you find at Chipotle that gets super messy and in my opinion is not very good. No this burrito is well propotioned as a meal and easy to eat. Not too messy or anything.  Also the Civeche is really great too, very fresh and crisp. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is kinda small. That's all.   Hell I give them 5 in my heart!",

We were a tad bit disappointed they did not have more choices on their menu. I understand keeping it simple, but if you are not in the mood for carne asada, you are kind of screwed.  2. I love that they are selling real \"Mexican\" coca-cola, but it's a little expensive at $3 a bottle.   Overall, cute (but very tiny) place that deserves a second visit.",

(They offer a larger one for $7.95) I guess I'm spoiled living in San Diego where I can get a Carne Asada burrito for super cheap! But I have to say the meat here was wayyyy better than most I've had at home. There was not ONE SINGLE bit of fatty gristle in my burrito.  And the burrito was simply made with only a few ingredients (meat, guac, pico de gallo, and onions) so I could really taste the smoky goodness of the meat. I liked it a lot. In fact, I liked it so much I went there twice in one weekend!  Try the corn with cotija cheese - YUM! And also make sure to drink one of America's Margarita's. I liked the Tamarindo but my husband liked the Jamaica.  Heck, try both!",

I went with the Torta de Carna Asada and HOLEY MEXICAN SANDWICH BATMAN!!! The absolute best torta I've ever had!! The bread was super soft and flaky, had the carne asada (which was much better this time..and two days later when I went again...sssh don't tell my wife) guacamole and I think onions.

    "text": "America's is obviously trying hard. They seem to be very media-aware and I think it's fair to say they have an enthusiastic local following. It is a charming little place, to be sure. Too bad it's all ruined by the brain-rattling ethno-techno soundtrack they've got bellowing from the speakers. Thankfully my Corona helped me avoid getting a headache. The menu is... odd. They have five or six offerings, but since all I'd heard about this place was \"carne asada!  carne asada!\" I uh... went for the carne asada.  I understand that there is authenticity and that authenticity comes with a price, but frankly, I really just don't CARE. I want my food to taste good and be reasonably priced and if it just so happens that the food also tastes exactly like your great aunt Carmelito made lo those many years ago in Oaxaca, the more's the better. This place serves mediocre (but authentic!) food in meager portions. The carne asada burrito, so breathlessly described by Phoenix magazine as not to be missed, is certainly delicious - but it took them 20 minutes to bring this out? Seriously? It's a kiddie burrito! On the side? A greying radish chunk. Yum!   I will say the salsa is delicious. Darn near perfect. Just the right texture, just the right flavors, fresh with the perfect amount of heat. It's a good thing, too, because you have to pay for it. I'm not opposed to paying for chips and salsa, but considering that you get it free as a starter at a lot of Mexican restaurants these days, I'd at least like to be asked if I want a refill. I would heap similar praise on the guacamole, but the guacamole sucks. If this is how they make it in Old Mexico, I'd sooner have it from Taco Bell. It tasted like avocado paste with a hint of oil. I'm serious, I saw somebody talking about how great the guac was and wondered if I had stumbled into an alternate reality (to be fair, this does happen to me a lot).  All in all, I paid about the same I would pay at any other competent Mexican restaurant, and got about half the food. I know, I know, it's a taco shack, not a Mexican restaurant - but the prices aren't taco shack, and taco shacks don't generally do table service, so whatever. When this sort of thing happens to me, I inevitably demand that the food be so delicious that it overshadows everything else. This has happened to me before, but is simply not the case here.",

I usually stay away from the beef in Mexican restaurants (especially \"Taco Stands\") fearing dog, cat, or other animals might have been harmed in the process.  The beef is outstanding.  For $20 bucks, two people can get a taco and burrito, chips and salsa, and 3 coronitas each.  Is there are better deal in town??  If you go to America's, make sure to try the Horchata and Iced Coffee blend.  It will blow your socks off.  To top it all off the staff is very courteous and nice.  The owner will pop his head out from time to time and make sure things are going well for you, and that you are enjoying your food.  All around a great experience, and one that should not be missed.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that their food is really good! I love their carne asada tortas and carne asada tacos.... a little on the pricey side and small portions. Food does not equal a great dining experience.  However when it comes to customer service they suck! The girls who work the front counter always seem to have an attitude, I don't know if it is family that works there but they need to have meetings with their staff on how to deal with customers and have better attitudes. Customers are the ones who keep them in business.  The last time my boyfriend and I were there was back in October, we have not been back since (WE USE TO go at least 2 times a week). After catching an evening movie down town we went to Americas to grab a bite to eat, staff was not friendly as we walked in, then we went to sit out in their patio (north side of building). They have green plastic chairs, as my boyfriend went to sit down the leg of the chair just broke off and he fell backwards hitting his head on the wooden post. Mind you, he is not a huge man, 6' 3\" 200lbs. He was more than embarrased since other people were outside and his head and hand were a little sore with the fall, we also noticed there was a broken chair sitting against back wall (leg broken off- Really? Shocker! Not!) After talking for a bit we figured with the wear and tear of weather the chairs were probably getting brittle and getting weak. A staff member came out a few minutes later with our food and asked if everything was ok, it seemed like he was insinuating he knew what happened but did not come right out and say so (They have windows right next to where it happened). My boyfriend told him the whole story and said we noticed the other chair and if it happened before they should have checked all the chairs because it could have happened to a child, pregnant woman or a heavier individual and the outcome could have been worse. The guy did not know what to say or do... he did not offer to pay for our meal or give us anything on the house and kept saying we could go to the hospital if we needed to. We asked for the manager/owner, he said he was out of town. So we asked for a contact number or email address. He gave us both.   The next day my boyfriend emailed the owner, he said he was out of town and sorry for what happened and would take care of us as soon as he got back in town in a couple of days..... it has been 4 months and we never heard back from him?!?....... WOW, way to go in customer service and pleasing the customer. Guess that is where his staff gets it from.  Hopefully they are keeping an eye on those chairs so it wont happen again, to YOU the CUSTOMER.... beware of the green chairs!!!!!",

It was a bit expensive but it won't deter me from coming back.  I would rather pay a little extra for homemade, good quality food!    Just a fair warning to the people who think this is fast food, it's not super fast.  It wasn't abnormally slow but I noticed two customers come in and were obviously agitated by the time they got their to go orders.  It was quite busy and all the food is homemade so it's not going to be super quick.  We got our food within 5 minutes and considering how busy the place was, I was happy with the time.  Good food is worth the wait!",

I love the elote (mexican street corn) here and the al pastor is some of the best in town. I also like that you can combo your favorite selections with rice and beans for a small upcharge. They have mexican coke in the bottle on ice as you step up to order so that is also something I like to see in your neighborhood taco shop.   Overall-great food and great staff.",

I tend to eat vegetarian dishes most of the time, and can definitely say I've had my fair share of non-meat dishes with no flavor.   The beans here are amazing (and lard free!), as is the guacamole.  The Trio is a great starter which includes chips, salsa, and guacamole. For the vegetarians the bean burrito (I add guac to it with a roasted jalapeno on the side), is quite tasty.  The menu item I look forward to the most (and sometimes go just for this item) is the America's corn.  Don't let the ingredients scare you away, just try it.  It's DELICIOUS!.  Sweet corn covered in mayo, cotija cheese, chili, and lime.  My boyfriend frowned at it the first few times I ate it in front of him, but once he gave it a chance he was hooked.  I crave these all the time! I do have one complaint about America's, and that is the horchata.  The horchata had good flavor, but is REALLY grainy.  I think it would be a lot better if it was strained.  This has lead me to no longer order horchata from here which is unfortunate because it makes a great accompaniment to their main dishes.         I have been to all three of their locations and each has an awesome patio great for enjoying a beer or margarita on a warm Phoenix day!",

I would like the horchat more if it was a little less bland (maybe a pinch more cinnamon?) but that's a minor quibble.  America's Taco Shop is pretty inexpensive but for being a taco shop, I wish the prices were more reasonable especially for the beverages and sides.  The first time I went I got a little too excited when I saw the Mexican Coke on the menu so I impulsively ordered it but was then shocked when it rang up as $3 (which costs more than a taco, yipes).

    "text": "First time in today.  When we walked in we were greeted and started looking at the menu.  After a minute or two I explained to the girl we had never been there before.  Normally this would be a chance for someone to really explain the menu or maybe recommend something.  Talk it up a little. That didn't happen.  After another couple minutes I asked her what she would recommend.  We got a really short answer, carne asada is good and bean and cheese burrito is good.  I was hoping for a little more.  Anyway, we ordered and got our food fairly fast.   I don't have any issues with the food.  It tasted good.  The complaint I have is on the price.  It was 8 bucks for a burrito and I really didn't feel like it was enough food for that price.  Anything else costs you extra.  On top of that a can of soda is 1.50.  A bottle of soda is $3.  Really?  I understand a company has to make a profit but I will stick to water for that price.  Not sure if I would go back.  I think there are places with just as good food, where you get more for less money.  The food tasted good and if it was less price it would would be worth it.",

The char sets good carne asada apart from the rest.  Loved the agua fresca offerings.... I got the jamaica and dining partner ordered tamarindo.  both tangy and refreshing.  however we take major points off for the chips/salsa.  it's a side dish for $1.50, with a fairly good sized basket of chips but a tiny little dribble of salsa.  we got more for another $1.50 and still felt ripped off.  I mean c'mon, kids, you can make gallons of the stuff for a small amount of dinero, you're shamelessly overcharging for it.  We will probably go back to try the Vampiro and the Pastor, but I'd gladly give more than 3 stars if you weren't so parsimonious with salsa, a Mexican restaurant staple.",

Many people have mentioned the elote (corn) and I would like to second their approval. The ceviche is also great and the vampiro brings a little class to the standard street taco.    People may complain about the diminutive menu but I say there is no need to when you do those few things well.  Do you same people whine about the lack of options at the In-N-Out?

The value is a bit less than average.   The small patio with umbrellas and water misters is a nice touch.  There is limited indoor seating with AC.   This shop is in a really convenient location.  The place has  a mostly authentic atmosphere and the staff was nice.  I'll go back to try a different meal to be sure I'm not missing anything.

Lower your prices or make the portions bigger - don't forget that you're using the cheapest cut of beef you can buy, marinating it with some orange juice, garlic and onions and then grilling it.

One Sunday I waited 20 minutes for 2 breakfast burritos, mind you it was breakfast time and I was the second customer in line.  The only thing good about America's on 7th St is the food.  I would much rather ride my bike to 7th St, but will instead drive to 7th Ave for your food based on service alone.

It's incredibly tiny as well, so I recommend the patio if you eat here unless you like people waiting for to-go orders standing like sardines pressed against you while you are trying to eat.

The food is not that expensive, but you're going to need to order more than you think you need to if you want leave feeling full.  Just be ready to spend a lot more than you thought you would at this dive.  I had the carne asada burrito and pastor taco.  I love that there's guacamole in the burrito, and the caramelized onions are great.  The burrito is fantastic, but a little smaller than I'd like for $6.  There is an XL option for $1 more.  Maybe I should try that next time.  The taco was also really good, but also small for $3.  All sides, including chips and salsa, are going to cost you extra.  My taste buds were certainly satisfied.  The food's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains (it may even be better than many full service restaurants), but you'll get a lot more for your money at those other places.  Your options for everything is steak, pork, or veggie.  I probably should have asked this while I was there;  But what does America's Taco Shop have against chicken?  The restaurant is small.  It does feel a lot like a little cantina somewhere in Mexico. There's very little room inside.  The patio seems like an okay spot, but I wouldn't want to be inside or out on a hot summer day.  The parking situation is really bad.  The lot is tiny.  Your best bet is to skip the lot and just find room on the neighborhood streets.",

I've never had street corn that tasted and looked like it was dipped in mayo.  A little too liberal with the usage of mayo for my taste.   My friend ordered the special which came with a veggie quesadilla.  It had guacamole in it - that's it.  Nothing else.  It didn't even make sense.   The salsa was boring.  That's really all there is to say about it.    All around, it was very average and uninteresting.  Too many other good places in DPHX to go to get quality Mexican food.   The one saving grace and the only reason I'll even consider going back was the beans that came with my friends special.  I tasted them and they were delicious.  I will for sure come back and try a bean and cheese burrito.",

Prices are a little high for this type of Mexican fare, but they're justified by the high-quality, fresh ingredients used. Rethink what you know about a bean and cheese burrito...theirs is a lard-free blend of beans and cheese in a lightly grilled tortilla. But it's the carne asada that's front and center here. The carne asada quesadilla and their specialty, the vampiro, are both exceptional. Add the unique America's corn and you've got yourself quite a fantastic meal!",

    "text": "I have been absolutely satisfied with the food at America's Taco Shop. I spent a couple of nights during their first week sampling the menu... The carne is as good as it gets...The menu is simple and filling, and the staff was/is extremely friendly and warm. I for one cannot wait for the patio to pick up with an evening with chips/salsa (which is AWESOME), a couple of tacos, and a bucket of beers before a Suns/D-Backs game... I am sure when the patio is complete (if they are smart) there will be speakers, some heaters, and good music. I can't say enough about the food... The corn is exceptional and different than anything I have had before. The salsa is fresh and just right. The meat is full of flavors and delicious on all of the items I have had, which is most of them... I was not able to finish off the bean burrito, but it could have been that I was so full from the 2 tacos, carne burro, and quesadilla I had pounded prior to it...I got half way through and was stuffed and at that point nothing was going to taste good...Wait, not True...the flan is excellent and it is making my stomach grumble right now that I don't have a piece to wash down the not so tasty Panda experience I had for lunch out here today... I am rambling now, but I want to post it clear here that America's Taco Shop is easily one of my new favorites in the area and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal at a reasonable price with friendly staff and a quaint atmosphere... One more thing, parking can be tricky, but it no worse than the place across the street (That's A Wrap), for those in the neighborhood, you know what I mean...I hope they stay around for a long time because I am just getting my appetite wet with their food!!! And hurry up and get that liquor license!",

The girl working the counter was attentive and nice but the food wasn't good, the only reason I ate it was I was hungry and a paid for it. The pastor had no flavor, and the flavor that was there was smothered with baby food consistency blender smooth bean paste that they loaded into my burrito, along with 2 pathetic pieces of pineapple and a plastic spoon full of gaucomole at the ass end of my burrito.",

The service is ok, bt what really killed me is the food. There stingy as hell with their servings, you go to any other taco place or Mexican food place and they make these burritos look like tooth picks. on top of that the food is bad, what I mean is the meat. It's bland and it doesn't feel like quality meat. It was cheery. Point blank ur better off hitting any of these food trucks on the corner streets",

My least favorite was the al pastor, nothing wrong with it, I just liked the other two more. Both the chicken and the Carne had a great charred flavor and the hot sauces accompanied them great. Service was also fantastic. Someone even came and took my tray when I was done, despite it being the kind of place you empty your own tray.

The soda dispenser did not work. When they finally got it to work my soda had way too much syrup.  2. I ordered two (2) grilled chicken tacos w/ chips and salsa to go. I only got one (1) grilled chicken taco and crushed chips.  3. My taco fell apart while I was trying to eat it. It was not that good. The taco fell apart in my hand... C'mon.  4. It took them a very long time to get my food ready. I placed my order at 11:49 am, they finally called my name at 12:13 pm. That is over 20 minutes for two (2) tacos, which I only received one (1). 20 minutes for one taco, again... C'mon!  5. The wait was so long the guy before me, ordered his food, got a soda, waited, and waited... and waited. He just left and didn't get his food.  6. There were more employees running around doing nothing, based on the disorganization of the place. In order for me to get my \"to go\" order, I had to wait for an employee to give it to me.   Overall, terrible place. I will not go there again. I paid $8.47 for one (1) flimsy grilled chicken taco, a crushed bag of chips and a 20 oz. coke that had mostly syrup in it. Avoid this place, there is a McDonald's across the road, go there for better service and a complete order, and it will also be cheaper. And sadly, it will also taste better.",

    "text": "We wanted to see what the hype was about this place, so my lady and I crawled out of bed at noon and came here for lunch.  We came on a Saturday afternoon, there were a few people dining in. I had the carne asada burrito and my girl had the carne asada tacos. The food was tasty, and hot. I'm sure about how I feel about all they hoopla over this place. It was a decent place to grab a bite to eat. The Horchata was good, and they sell Mexican Coca-Cola. The price was all right, but you could definitely get carne asada at a Filibertos or any of the other 'Bertos for that matter that was just as tasty and for a few less dollars.  *Update* I received an email from the proprietor of this Taco shop, he stated to me that \"if you can not see the difference in quality from us and the other \"Bertos\", maybe this isn't the place for you\"...  I'm not sure why a restaurant owner would shoo away a guest, especially a guest who said the food was good, he was just not understanding of the hype.  So if you're like me, and think Filibertos is good, keep going there, because obviously, the owner of this establishment doesn't need our business",

    "text": "After living in Sonora, Mexico for quite some time I developed quite the affinity for good carne asada tacos.  I find the inconsistencies among the many taquerias around valley frustrating.  I think after all these years, I have finally found my favorite carne asada in the valley.    America's Taco Shop is a very cute local restaurant on a strip of 7th St. that has many more cute local restaurants.  Beyond that, it is a True carne asada taqueria.  The lack of authenticity only extends to the geographic location and overall atmosphere of the restaurant.  I can assure you, it ends there.  Being a first-generation Mexican-American, I have no problem whatsoever being served good carne asada (or any Mexican food for that matter) by a gringo, assuming said carne is up to my taste.   And boy is it ever.  It brought me back to Bahia de Kino, sitting on the porch at La Pasadita, taking in the sea breeze, snacking on a radish after a few tacos.  The meat was tender and moist, held together well with the homemade salsa and excellent tortillas.  The only fault of this place was the premium paid over most local taquerias.    A real, True carne asada shop has only that.  You've got to go to the right place to get the right stuff.  I can appreciate and respect a restaurant that is willing to bank on the quality of their product so much that it is all they offer.  The limited menu is a testament to their, and my, belief in America's family recipe.    The expectation and desire for more serves only as evidence of our country's degradation.  We have become fat, lazy and unwilling to go the extra mile for something that we could at one time appreciate.  The idea that we should be able to get everything in one place is a glaring symbol of our wal-mart-oriented culture of instant gratification.    The purpose of America's Taco Shop is to provide a place we can go to get one thing done right, not a collective of mediocrity.  When it can be appreciated as such, there is no need to expect more or be disappointed.",

    "text": "Decided to give this place a shot one fine Saturday after many recommendations and the positive reviews here on yelp, which left me with some pretty high expectations.  Now, I need to preface this by saying I am a Mexican and have eaten alot of carne asada tacos in my lifetime.  I love them.  And I'm open to trying them \"as they come\" from different establishments.   When ordering tacos, the price is usually an indicator of the size no?  Like an average lunch should be no more than $10? Especially when we're talking carne asada tacos.  I don't think that's too much to expect especially from a place calling itself a \"taco shop\".  So when i saw the tacos were just shy of $3 each I figured two would suffice.  Nope.  I'm guessing maybe four of those suckers might have filled me up.  More than I'm willing to pay for simple carne asada tacos.  But its good to support small local business right? Right.  The tacos here were good. Tasty.  And I understand their \"shtick\" and all.  Good service, nothing out of this world but by no means bad.  They had a couple kids working up front.  The horchata was tasty.  Food came out promptly.  I'm sure they used quality ingredients and at no point did I feel the possibility of contracting some food-borne illness from my food (which would have made the experience more authentic in my opinion, heh)  I just didn't think it was \"all that\" and the size/taste, to me, did not justify the price.  This place is like \"street tacos\" for suits, families,  or people who are scared of going into Mexican dives.   On a sidenote: the photo treatment they use over and over again on \"America's\" photo is ill-suited and miss leading.  I thought that was the \"vampiro\" I saw mentioned.  Guys if you need a menu re-design hit me up.  :)  I will probably be back at some point since this is in my neighborhood and the food was tasty after all.  I'll either order more tacos or something else.",

I really want to like coming here, their happy hour specials are great and they have a really good breakfast burrito. However, the counter service the last few times ive been in has been seriously dissapointing. Actually, they've been downright rude. There is no \"hello, how are you?\"when you arrive. Nothing. In fact, on our last visit,my husband and i were completely ignored while the girl behind the counter finished her conversation with one of the kitchen guys. i find this unacceptable.

    "text": "I love the carne asada burrito it is the best I have ever had!!!  It comes with a slice of lime, radish and a homemade salsa that is great.  I order an xl carne asada burrito because the normal carne asada burrito is just a wee bit to small for me.  This is the Cadillac of carne asada burritos the meat is great has a nice char to it and yet still juicy.  The homemade horchata (mexican drink) is on point and has my girlfriend hooked.  What also is great is that unlike those other Mexican quick food places you can grab a Mexican beer, Margarita and they even have Mexican bottled Coca Cola made from real sugar rather than our high-fructose corn syrup Coca Cola we get in the good ol' U.S of A.  This place has been added to my list of regular grub spots.    This is another downtown spot that was previously someones home.  I am still not used to the squeaking sound that the floors of these old houses turned into a business make when you walk on them.  I sometimes feel like my big self is going to fall through like you see on cartoons.  The dining area is small.  If you have a group I would suggest you have someone snag a table because bye the time you order there might not be somewhere to sit.  The place can fill up quick.  Hey but that is the charm of these places downtown.  If you don't like it go to the burbs.",

Crave the creamy, non-lard beans even more than the carne asada.  Diggin the outdoor picnic tables.  Hesitant to order the corn because sometimes it has too much sauce n cheese, which overpower the pure joy of grilled corn.  Not so crazy about my last experience where the cashiers showed more personality talking to each other or the kitchen crew than they did to me while taking my order. I'm paying $6 for a burrito, could it hurt to smile and maybe offer me a happy hour beer when I'm here picking up my take out dinner?",

    "text": "If you like carne asada, I mean if you really like carne asada, this place is definitely worth checking out. If you like a variety to choose from, maybe not.  The menu is a little limited with the main dishes being carne asada taco, burrito, tostada (Vampiro) and quesadilla. They do have one vegetarian dish and, of course, chips and salsa.  Now for the good news. The carne asada is pretty good. I tried the Vampiro and the quesadilla. Both were very tasty. Some people have mentioned that the chips and salsa are extra, but most counter service places I've been to charge for chips and salsa. It's worth it. The chips are fresh and the salsa is not particularly hot but has a great flavor.  It's definitely worth a try, especially if you like carne asada.",

    "text": "I was so hungry after attempting to waste time downtown between meetings (aka window shopping).  I wanted to treat myself to lunch, but did not want a super long wait (it was lunch time), and also didn't want to drop a ton of cash...and I wanted something delicious!  That's when I remembered that I had heard great things about America's Taco Shop (America, by the way is the name of one of the owners, it is not a reference to our continent).  It seems everyone has been hearing great things about America's Taco Shop--I even heard some guys there talking about how it really has blown up (thanks to yelp and news reviews) and that there even is another location in the works.  I got a bean and cheese no-lard (good!) burrito.  I got the regular size which was perfect and chips and salsa.  It was SO GOOD...creamy bean and cheese...mmm...I really should not write reviews while I'm hungry...I'm too tempted to go down there immediately...anyway...  The prices are great, the salsa is to die for (spicy, pureed almost, really great--perfect on the chips).  There wasn't a crazy line (though I make no promises, this place is popular and there was a longer line when I left).  Parking was slightly cramped, but especially decent for downtown.  There is seating outside on a fun large patio enclosure.  You order at the counter and the food is brought to you.  It's a great place to go and eat Mexican food without feeling like you just blew your morning at the gym...that is, unless you overeat by ordering every item on the menu--which you might be tempted to do, everything's so good.",

    "text": "The key to this place is the meat is cooked over fire, which only a few \"taco shop\" type places in greater Phoenix bother to do, and it imparts a different flavor to the meat. For $5.95, my burrito with loaded with tasty carne asada and little else... no beans or rice fillers - just good beef, not dry or grissely, nor mushy/steamed. It contained some pico de gallo and guac, though I didn't notice any guac until the last few bites (must have loaded one end).   The biggest negative for me is paying extra for chips and salsa, especially when the chips come from a local store (and aren't that good). Also, don't go if in a hurry - it's a popular place and a small kitchen, so it can take a short while for orders to come up.   Overall, some might get annoyed with the parking, waits, add-ons, etc. but if you like grilled asada, they do it better than most in PHX.",

The Carne torta is the best I've had in Phoenix, and the vampiro tacos are awfully pleasant and every satisfying.  They tend to have some fun stuff on the menu such as their shrimp ceviche or coffee/horchata mix, and they have some nice specials on weekends, and loads of Mexican beer (bleccch!) and o.k. margaritas.  They fall a bit flat on their side dishes, I certainly expected something better than what I got for \"America's Corn\"...not nearly as tasty as you would expect it to be. Overall, 3.5 - 4 stars for the food.  They score 5 stars from me for the appearance of the place...the character and theme is decidedly local and doesn't feel overly contrived, which is the usual downfall for a place like this or a chain competitor (such as 2 - 2.5 star joints like Rubio's or Tacos Del Mar).  Solid four star service.  For a family of four, expect to drop 25-30$.  Not bad for some pretty good and relatively authentic tacos and burros...enjoy!",

    "text": "Let me preface this fact: I have eaten what could amount to a family of cows (that would be daddy cow, momma cow and 2.5 child cows) in carne asada during my life. Needless to say I like it. This doesn't make me an MD in C.A. but I've had really good (i.e. Yeah, I loved it so much I'd marry it.) and really bad (i.e. Truly thought I'd die.) and everything in between.  That said I'd place America's Taco shop squarely in the middle. Again, it's just my opinion but it was really nothing special. Maybe, and I say MAYBE, I was slightly thrown by the hype and was expecting too much.  That alone though wouldn't have merited my two stars. I eat at plenty of places with just-okay quality of food but I go back because of the atmosphere or service. But the fact that the wait was over 30 minutes for two tacos, a vampiro and a burrito was part of it.  Also, the help was less than, um, help. Two teenagers with that wonderful teen-approach to service. Example, not knowing exactly what an item includes. Lastly, the prices. A vampiro at most places is the size of a good portioned tostada. At A.T.S. however everything down to the burrito was half the size of what I expected, and pricier. I understand the tacos being small as is traditional for carne asada tacos but don't price them $3 a pop. I could get the same quality and half the price at Food City (no joke).  The seating was really limited so this place would probably be best for a pick-up order to avoid the wait.  The positives were that that the food came exactly as I'd ordered it and also they served elote (corn) traditional style which you don't see much outside of late night taco stands. Also, the place was clean and the small house it was built into was neat.",

I've eaten the Vampiro, Carne Asada Burrito, Chips n Guac/Salsa, and America's corn (yummy!!). My eyes are always bigger than my stomach :).  I will say that the last time I did get the corn, it was a little under-cooked. So it was a little harder to chew...but regardless, it was still good. Smothered with mayo, butter, and cojita cheese I think...how can you go wrong with all of that yummy-ness!!  I would visit this place again, if I am down in that area.

It was lunchtime and we had been doing a lot of shopping, so the husband and I had worked up quite the appetite.  We didn't realize that America's was going to be more like appetizer sized food that comes out in entree time.  We waited in line for about 5 minutes or so, I looked at the menu and decided to go basic with a bean and cheese burrito.  It sounded really good at the time.  We ordered and then sat down and waited.    And waited, and waited, and waited.  Ugh!  But wait, the husband's food came out first.  Almost an entire five minute before mine.  His meal was so small he was pretty much finished by the time I got my burrito.  My burrito was really blah.  I think it's cool that they don't cook the beans with lard, but apparently that translates into a complete and utter lack of flavor.  Same goes for the cheese.  I had no idea any was even in there.  So, I left hungry and unhappy with a nasty bean film in my mouth.  I won't be back.",

I order two things here..Tacos and Quesadilla.... I normally do not eat quesadilla, but here its something else... Cheese, moist and perfectly seasoned asada, with grilled sauteed onions all between a light crisp homemade tortilla?!?  What else can be better??  Well, maybe there are other things:)  But for this moment, during my 15 sec of fame...I mean review....Lets amuse ourselves:)  Go...you will not be disappointed",

The food is fresh and tasty, however, portion size is rather small.  Normally I would not portion size influence my rating, but when Phoenix has an abundance of inexpensive and amazingly delicious Mexican eats around, points will have to be deducted.",

We hit the Coronado location today for lunch and despite planning our meet for 11:30 to increase our chances of landing a table inside we were diverted to Patio City. Huge bummer.  The burrito was all kinds of delicious (and the portion is perfect, unlike the 'roided up burritos found at Qdoba, Chipotle and even Chico's) but sitting at a rock hard, scorching hot picnic table took a bit of the enjoyment away from the experience.   I understand the converted house is tiny (and that's part of charm), but would investing in some misters downgrade the authenticity? I think not.   Also, I'm not against any Green initiatives, but delivering food baskets sans napkins is a bad move.  I'll definitely go back for the carne, but probably not anytime before late October.",

I had a carne asada burrito and it was probably the best I've ever had. But let me speak of the guacamole.....mmmmmm!!  If you like guac, this is awesome guac!!  It's got just enough kick in it and it is very tasty.  Their chips are fresh and crispy and a nice compliment to the guac.  My daughter loved the cheese quesedilla and ate the whole thing.  When we got in the car to leave she said she wanted to come back the next day!  That's high praise from a six year old!  The shop is a cute little house with several tables inside and a nice seating area outside.  Parking can be a little of a challenge.  There is only one way in and it's the same way out.  So if you're leaving and someone is coming in, well....you get the picture.    The staff is always friendly and accomodating.  They make you feel at home.  The prices are reasonable so you don't break the bank either.   Thank you America!!",

I love their bean and cheese burrito. The first time I had it, I fell in love.  I loathe the fact that the second time I got it, the beans were cold and ruined the lovely memory I had of my first time.  I love the fact that I can ride my bike there from my place downtown and have a couple beers. I loathe the fact that when I have to drive there, I might as well have ridden my bike because there's NEVER ANY PLACE TO PARK!!  I love the fact that it's a Mom and Pop shop, complete with family photos on the wall. I loathe the fact that it's a Mom and Pop shop and there is so much inconsistency in the food from visit to visit.  So, want to try? Here's what I recommend:  Ride your bike, order the bean and cheese burrito and ask them to please make sure the beans are hot. Then have a couple cold ones, enjoy the patio and ride your drunken ass home.",

Most of them seem reasonably priced until you see their size.  I ordered the Vampiro because it sounded good, had guac, carne asada, and was portrayed as a quesadilla type meal.  Ya, this thing was like the size of a Kennedy half dollar - and half as filling!  What the hell? $4 for this?  I can't even taste the guac!!  If I want cheap good mexican food, I guess I'll stick with 'Bertos because this place is a disaster.  At least at 'Bertos I can get more than 5 items and the burritos are Soviet-car-sized.",

Twice after my first visit, convinced that I had accidentally gone to the wrong America's or perhaps stumbled into a nearby taco shop on 7th.   Alas, the helpful Yelp photo informs me that I have, in fact, now eaten three times at the Famous America's Taco Shop.  I can't emphasize how incredibly average and underwhelming the fare here is. See, I'm a burrito man, myself. I don't claim to know Mexican food or it's various subgenres, but I did live in San Diego for three years and I've definitely had what I would call over-the-top, blow your socks out your a** good Mexican food. The same can be said for any number of burritos.   America's, I'm sorry to say it, but neither your tacos nor your burritos live up to the incredible hype that now surrounds you (although, the salsa was really, really good).

The salsa is great, I don't know what \"style\" it is because every now and again I've had it other places but it's my favorite. It's a cross between a pico and a red sauce, blended but not runny at all.  Yes they make you pay for chips and salsa, and I've seen the tiny tablespoon size take out container for salsa so beware.

Today I learned that if you do not eat beef, America's Taco Shop is not a good place for you.   I was caught off guard with the very limited menu containing only beef items.  The two non-beef options did not include chicken, which I found odd and irritating at the same time.  I went for the vegetarian quesadilla which was a huge disappointment.  It was lettuce, a little bit of cheese and guac in a tortilla and it was not in any stretch of imagination a delicious meal.  I had ordered chips and salsa as well, and I did find that the salsa was pretty tasty.    It is in a cute house and the salsa is decent.  If you don't love the cow, I'd pass on America's Taco Shop.",

I'm talking about the taco lady, who is warm, welcoming, and helpful no matter who walks in the door. She'll ask if it's your first time and then come up with a load of suggestions.  3) The carne asada is wow. I'm serious.  And one thing not so much to like about America's taco shop:  1) The price. 3 tiny tacos, chips and an agua fresca = something like $12. I wasn't anticipating on spending that much at a taco shop. The food was damn good, don't get me wrong, but this place may be more of an indulgence than a regular pitstop.  Last thing to know, this joint is all about the carne asada, so it's best you are a fan of beef. There isn't much middle ground between it and vegetarian options (ie. no chicken on the menu, from what I can remember). Not that this a bad thing. Just worth keeping in mind for friends who have red meat restrictions.  4 solid stars.",

The spicy and the mild taste about the same, when before there was a distinct difference.  The lard-free beans are still delicious, as are the carne asada tacos.

What showed up was a pitiful collection of sad, below Taco Bell quality food.   The burrito was small for an XL; I was expecting something made in a manhole sized tortilla like any Mexican grocery store will make for the same price. It was filled with gummy, mushy rice, and a few scraps of some kind of chewy, flavorless meat. Total waste, into the trash it went after one bite.  The tacos were laughable. Store bought tortillas that had the consistency and taste of wet paper. The filling in each was garbage. Some kind of meat (all terrible, overcooked, chewy, one had a nasty, cinnamon-allspice type taste to it, ick!), a few onions and a small dab of what they must call guacamole.   The side cups were each slightly less than half full. Beans were 80% gloppy goo, 100% flavorless. The rice was the same gummy junk in the burrito. Trash.   For $16, I expect something better than shit I just have to throw away. I would be embarrassed to put out food this unappetizing and low end for the price.   Avoid at all costs.",

May the owner/management encourage all staff to be more mindful, with human compassion for \"all customers\" regardless of content of clothing, gender or color of skin.

We would come here a couple of times a week for years, i CRAVED this place!!!   The prices have always been a bit pricey but the food was delicious, so I didn't care.  I remember, when they first opened, the portions were huge, almost annoyingly so, two hands just could not hold the burritos together, hey, not complaining, I loved how generous they were with their portions and again...the food...delicious!!     My favorite thing on the menu was their bean and cheese burrito and chips and salsa.  I tried everything on the menu but this was my absolute favorite.  Normally, I don't like refried beans (when I go out for Mexican, I always sub extra rice for the beans).  I knew it was amazing when I realized my favorite menu item was something I normally disliked.   Then, they opened the one on 7th ave and then one in Tempe. I was thrilled they were doing so well, I did not want this place to go under!! I noticed gradually through the years, the portion sizes had become smaller and smaller, still didn't care...delicious.   THEN, out of the blue, I lost my taste for it.  I just figured i was eating it too often and just needed a break.  I went back months later, excited again, but no, the same thing.  I waited longer this time, thinking it was just me... still wasn't loving it.  It made no sense, I could not figure out how i went from craving this food to not enjoying it anymore.  I would give it a try every so often and always ended up feeling the same way, confused and underwhelmed.  Prices were going up, burritos were getting smaller, new stores were opening up on Camelback and in Scottsdale and I just wasn't loving it.    Then, last year, I gave it another shot... while standing in line, reading through the menu, I noticed  the bean burritos were made with jack cheese!!! Here's thing, they used to be made with cotija and it literally made the burrito.  The jack cheese just made it taste like every other ok burrito with minimal flavor.  When I noticed that, I asked if they could sub cotija for the jack and they said they don't have cotija.  I mentioned, it used to be made with cotija and she said not for the 3 or 4 years she had been working there....aaaaaaah! just about the time I started to notice I wasn't enjoying the food anymore.    I haven't been back since and I notice, a couple of the stores have shut down.  It makes me sad, because this place really had a good thing going.  I am not saying the food is horrible now, but guys, the food used to be sooooo much better. It saddens and frustrates me when quality and consistency takes a back seat to growth.   When they cut corners they cut out what made them great.",

    "text": "America's Taco Shop is the most consistently underwhelming establishment on Yelp. The food is good but doesn't make up for the portion sizes (too small) and service issues (typically with regard to preparing your order to match the receipt). For example, we were there last Sunday afternoon and there was only one other table in the restaurant yet the employee had to visit our table to confirm our drink order and, when dropping off our food, asked if we needed anything else and I had to point out the missing items. I at least understand that this stuff happens when places are in a rush; it boggles my mind that there is such little organization when the restaurant is slow.  America's has done an excellent job capitalizing on their early reputation. As they've expanded, however, I'm afraid to say that the overall experience that earned them this reputation has degraded considerably.",

Call me basic -- I don't care.  Their tacos are great but tiny. Their pastor meat is carved right off of one of those huge rotisserie things like you'd see at the taco stands in Mexico. LEGIT.  This is the original location in a historical little bungalow, and still has the soul and character that are lacking at the franchises. The staff here is friendly and cool, and it's just all around an awesome place.",

For my morning beverage pairing, I went with a cochata. The burrito was very good. I really liked the steak better than the chorizo in it and the beans were excellent; also, the jalapeno was super fresh! I really appreciate a fresh pepper like that. What really got me though was the cochata. It's pretty simple, coffee and horchata, but I had never had it before. The flavors go together very well, and if you like sweet coffee drinks, you should love this! I can't wait for the weather to get cool again because the patio looked awfully cozy and would be a great place to enjoy a cerveza.",

That is debatable like all things in life.  Located in the the historic Coronado neighborhood in an old renovated house like many other businesses in the area.  If you know the area you know what I am talking about.  It's not in a strip mall like most of metro Phoenix.  So why come here?  Here's a few reasons that I have come up with.  It's not to far from downtown so it's a convenient location for lunch.  It's hip, trendy and definitely not like anything you would experience in the rest of the valley.  It's very authenic. Prices are not very high.  Lastly the carne asada tacos are really really that good.  I think America and her husband made their dream come True with the creation of this restaurant.  A small taco shop that serves up some great food, decorated very uniquely, and definitely different than most things out there.",

I used to think it is over-rated and too expensive, and after last night, I'll just say that it truly isn't very good. $20 for dinner for two is reasonable enough, but the food is absolutely the blandest, most americanized, excuse for Mexican I've ever eaten. I grew up in Phoenix, in a hispanic neighborhood, eating Mexican for almost every meal every day. This place is not the least bit Authentic... it's just a gringo excuse for mexican food.  The patio out front looks like some amateur do-it-yourself'er made a trip to Home Depot and built a budget enclosure. Seriously? you put plywood up in your parking lot... that's not really a way to make a proper patio. I can't believe the city allowed this debacle.   The kid who took our order on our last trip didn't know what was on the menu and repeatedly asked the woman there what was included in our meal. Learn the menu before you go up front and start working... this is not his fault, it's poor training and management.   Please boycot this restaurant so it can go away and the building can be used for something useful. There are a lot of great places up and down seventh street, but this piece of crap brings them all down to a lower level.",

    "text": "After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \"Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.  Overall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \"Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close.",

    "text": "I haven't tried the Carne Asada here yet (but I know I will be back to do so) but all I can say is BEST BEAN & CHEESE BURRITO EVER!!!  After reading some reviews on yelp I decided to go and pick up lunch at America's.  The parking was a bit tricky to figure out at first, and I wouldn't recommend going after you get your car washed or if it is raining because it is just a dusty, dirt lot; but once I got inside and got my burrito, all was forgotten.  They advertise that they don't use any lard in their beans...and well, lard is usually what makes the beans so creamy and delicious; so I was intrigued.  Well upon my first bite, I was not missing the lard at all!  The tortilla was so fresh and delicious, and the beans, oh the beans, were creamy and had just the right amount of melted Monterrey jack cheese mixed in with them.  I was in heaven...and for only $3.25....this is definitely a budget friendly and waistline friendly meal!    P.S. I only ate half of the burrito to start with, and then ate the other half later cold....it was almost even better cold!  I will be back...and next time...I will try to force myself to try the carne asada!",

All were pretty good and you could tell freshly made. The part I was impressed by most that made this place stand out were the refried beans. At the first bite I could tell these were the real deal. Homemade and NOT made with lard. I'm not a fans of beans unless their homemade and these were it.  Can't wait to try their food.  Seeing as how the person who recommended them was Mexican herself, that's a plus for me.  She say they make their horchata so I can't wait to try everything else!  FYI - It's called \"America's\" b/c that's the owners name.  Has nothing to do with our actual country.",

    "text": "Being so close to my office, ATS was one spot I wanted to check out as soon as I saw it on Yelp. Walking in, you really have to love the layout. Another \"restaurant in a house\", the Shop has a very breezy open feel, with not a lot of seating. It was early, only 5pm, so there weren't many customers. Without a wait, I was able to walk right up and order a carne asada burrito. BurrITO. I emphasize the \"ito\", because when I got home, I realized they gave me a burro. Honestly, I didn't know the difference, so I can't be too upset.  Biting into the burro, I immediately agreed with their motto; it really is the best carne asada I have had in town. Great flavor, a little salty, and the texture is perfect. The wrap was perfect; little bit of added flavor, but thick as well (which is essential with the juice from the carne asada). I only had two issues, and one may just be due to the mistaken order. The burro only had the meat and the pico de gallo, so it was a little boring. Delicious, but boring. Also, as others noted, it's pricy. Even without a tip, the XL burro was about $9, and you got something smaller than a Chipotle burrito. Once again, delicious, but a few bucks more than I would have liked to pay.  Long story short, the meat is delicious, and it's well worth trying out. I will certainly go back to try a burrito, and will try to enunciate my words a little more!",

There are plenty of places I have had better Carne Asada. I'm going to blaspheme according to some, but I've had better Carne Asada at Chipotle, for meat's sake. I thought the meat was overcooked. I have yet to find somewhere that comes close to Comedor Guadalajara for Carne Asada. The side of beans was ok.  The staff was courteous and friendly, the service was great. But, I really don't see what the big deal is about America's Taco Shop. After all the hype, I expected it to be great. But it was good, at best. With a menu as limited as America's Taco Shop has, they should excel at what little they do offer and that's just not the case.",

I got a soggy torta with just beans, avocado, and two tomato slices. I called the location, the person who answered by the name of Dixy was speaking in Spanish to Luis and asked him if he knew what ingredients are in the torta, I heard Luis say no. Anyways Dixy was nice enough to have me come in on a later date to have my order replaced but out of the blue I receive a call from a \"manager\" by the name of Tom or Terry I don't quite remember but he was rude to say the least, he did a great job at throwing the ball at other people looking for somebody to blame (including blaming me the customer) instead of taking ownership for the error on THEIR MENU. He needs to learn how to listen and tone it down with his condescending self absorbed attitude.  SO TERRY HOW AM I BEING DISHONEST? I literally uploaded a screenshot of your menu and I never said I was expecting chicken, hello you said yourself that the vegetarian torta has lettuce and jalapenos which mine DIDNT include, Dixy had already said she was going to REMAKE so what did YOU CALL ME FOR? You're the one who ESCALATED this I was fine before your call. YOU MYST LOVE AGGRAVATING AND ARGUING WITH CUSTOMERS.",

OK, maybe not quite that extreme, but I really enjoyed my experience here.  First I am not from PHX and I am so jealous that you all get to eat outside in April.  My town is cold and frigid so it was such a treat to have our first meal in this town outdoors at a picnic table with a Dos Equis.  I enjoyed the carne asada and pork tacos.  The steak was my favorite, tender and fabulously cooked.  I loved the corn tortillas.  The guac was wonderful and a tasty add on that everyone must try!  The food came out fast and was inexpensive.  This is a great place to enjoy some friendly chatter over fabulously delicious food.",

Absolutely  no flavor in the meat! No flavor in condiments on taco or taco shell, or sauce. The amount of meat was very small. The chips and salsa was like it was from taco bell or something. The only flavorful thing I had there was the mexican bottled coke that was way overpriced, $3! Even the ambiance was low grade. Uncomfortable chairs and no personality. I am actually angry about this place getting good reviews. It is soooo easy to take beef, marinate it and grill it up and make it delicious.  Maybe the people who think this is the best carne asada should go to the closest roach coach and get a real carne asada taco, it would be cheaper and 100 times better.",

    "text": "One of the most important things in life is to live no more than a minute away from great Mexican fast food. I'm blessed to have America's Taco Shop fulfill that need.   'Berto's beware, I'll never frequent you again thanks to the amazing Carne Asada at America's. The meat is freakishly tender and cooked to perfection. The grilled onions are the Cher to the meats' Sunny. Simply put, the Carne Asada burrito is damn good!   The corn is a delight as well. I despise mayo and yet I still can't get past ordering the corn. Lightly coated in mayo then shellacked in cheese, with a spritz of lime and Cholula, the corn is to die (or kill) for.   You'd think that two noteworthy items like these would be enough but NO! The True star of the shop is the beans. Light and flavorful they set the standard for beans everywhere.   My sister is a little bit of a dirty redneck. When I mentioned that the beans were lard free she scoffed. I hate scoffing so I demanded that she try them. An hour later she was convinced, and properly apologetic. Thank you America's for giving me the rare win over a dirty redneck.   America's is a great little shop in central Phoenix, and one that I will continue to frequent. Thanks for existing!   NOTE: During peak hours the parking lot can be a little scary. You've been warned.",

One of them was a map with all the cool/hip spots downtown and we realized we hadn't been to many of them. So we Decided to go to all of the ones listed and cross em out. And, this was our first stop.   I'm gonna start off by saying how much i like the vibe of this place, especially the outside seating on a sunny day. The food was so yummy. And, I normally don't like going to eat Mexican food other than my own Mom's kitchen because I am Hispanic and extremely picky.  I really love their carne tacos and quesadillas.. Their beans(lard free) are my favorite.  The horchata is not that powdery crap. It's home made.  I really do love this place. I've been here a few times already and also brought my parents who loved the place as well.  The only thing I will say is that -if you want to get completely full, it is a bit pricey.  I tend to crave this food a lot, and I'm glad I finally found a lil taco shop that met my standards.  Way to go America!",

    "text": "I drive by this taco shop treat on a daily basis and love shopping in the Melrose District. Mexican food restaurants line the streets of Arizona like every day is Cinco de Drinko, so I had to check them out and see how they earn the title of America's Taco Shop.   During the work day, I'm on the hunt for lunch spots where I can be in and out without a True sit-down experience. Someplace with an outdoor patio is a plus, unless it's a sauna outside. America's Taco Shop had just that. You enter and order at the counter, then you can chose indoor or outdoor seating. Sadly, it was a bit windy when I went and in addition to my plastic silverware running away from me, the misters decided I needed a mid-afternoon shower.   With such Yelp reviews, I felt the pressure when ordering my food and wanted to make sure I got the real experience, so I asked the cashier what his favorite choice was. He said the Carne Asade Burrito was hands down his favorite. I'm not going to question the man who lives and breathes by the restaurant.  They brought me chips and salsa while I waited. The chips tasted fresh and probably homemade. The salsa had a hint of a kick to it but not enough to send you to the fire hydrant. Then came the burrito. The tortilla was homemade, fresh and like it was straight from Mexico. Very tasty! The burrito itself was pretty darn good. I'm a sucker for guac so I wish I'd asked for some on the side. I've been to my fair share of Mexican restaurants and this burrito pretty much melted in your mouth.   So on days when I'm a lunchtime loner or the social butterfly with friends, I'll definitely recommend this spot for tacos....wish I could have tried the margaritas.   Cha Ching! The cashier pointed out two great traits. 1. Taco Tuesdays: four tacos for $6.00. Not bad! 2. Happy Hour. The happiest hour of them all with $2 beers and $1 tacos. Looks like I'll also be making a stop on my way home from work!",

Put some salsa to taste, and a lime, i personally love the lime on it, but some only add a little. Pineapple (ONLY if requested) and THEN you have a REAL taco Al pastor.   Once I requested the 'traditional' style - it was just as good as one i would get in Mexico City - albeit the meet was a little on the toasty side (turn the burner DOWN!)  Didn't eat anything else there - finally found the first al-pastor on the spit place in north America. I sense an Al pastor revolution cometh.",

I have to admit I am rather picky when it comes to Mexican food. I think most Mexicans are because nothing is going to compare to what Nana used to make us when we were young. Although I am choosy I do have favorite places that can suffice when I need some spice. (Sorry I had to be corny)   They have signs that say best carne asada in town and I am sorry, but the Charlie's catering cart has better carne asada and they do not charge $3 per Mexican coke. 3 BUCKS!

Unfortunately, I also looked past my instinct to avoid any place with \"best _______________ in town\" on a sign out front.  I ordered the \"pastor\" tacos for quick bite and a XL carne asada burrito for some now, some later.  I'll start with the al pastor tacos... mediocre doesn't even begin to describe them. The corn tortillas were steamed and a bit undercooked, the pork was salty at best. I don't know why nobody can get it right here and insists that al pastor is just adobada on a vertical spit. Twenty-five million chilangos called and they're angry with you. I suppose I should have known better, ordering a DF dish from a Sinaloan-owned restaurant, but they could have at least succeeded with the onions and cilantro and a thin slice of warm pineapple. Like I said, not even mediocre.  Then there's the burrito... the reason I begrudgingly gifted America's two stars instead of one. They at least tried. The meat appeared to be arrachera (skirt steak) that had been over-marinated and lost its texture. It's really a shame when a place say they have CARNE ASADA and don't cook over an open flame.  Salsas were lifeless and they charge for chips. And as someone else pointed out... YOU CHARGE FOR JALAPENOS??? Come on now... I shop at Food City for my mexican produce and you're just being \"codo\" when it comes to this.  My advice: skip America's and head over to Villa la Parrilla next to Charlie's on Camelback.   My wife and I (Coahuila Mexico and Northern California) agreed that its the only Mexican food we've had in town yet that was any good.",

My coworker always gets a bean burrito with no cheese and EVERY time they've messed up the order and had to re-make it leaving us eating at different times. 3 weeks ago we were eating here and the Sheriff's department shut it down because of illegal immigration. Took 2 weeks for them to open up shop again. Unfortunately this has had a worse effect on the service (at least it seems as though this is the case) because not only did my burrito come out 1/2 hour later, but as I finally got up the courage to complain, the manager gave us all kinds of excuses and no apologies. I guess I'd still eat their food if it was take out but other than that, I don't think I'll be coming back to America's taco shop anymore. Good Luck guys!!",

    "text": "On a referral write-up we read in a well received Phoenix Food publication, my Fiance & I put America's Taco Shop on our list of 'must visits,' as we both absolutely LOVE great Mexican Food. Consequently, after some time lapse from the date of reading the esteemed recommendation of this Shop having 'THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley,' we FINALLY visited and experienced their food last night for dinner.  We ordered 2 Carne Asada Burritos (regular size) and 2 Carne Asada Tacos, just as they are prepared, unmodified.  The tacos are without a doubt good.  However, they are standard Asada street tacos in size and with garnishing.  Outside of happy hour times, these Asada tacos are sold at $2.35 each, not at all a good value, however, during happy hour, they're only $1.00 a piece, which is appropriate, relative to what one receives in portion.  The burritos, when ordered in the regular size, can easily be referred to and identified as a junior sized burrito, which will set you back about $6.00 a piece...This is UNHEARD of in the Valley, where GREAT MEXICAN FOOD abounds and is generally offered at a very good value.  Not the case here.  Food was good, but certainly NOT THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley...Not even marginally.  Needless to say, my Fiance and I were equally disappointed with our findings.  Therefore, we will not return nor recommend America's Taco Shop as a 'must visit' Asada stop to any of our friends or colleagues; UNLESS one finds themselves in an unusual bind and it's happy hour time...Then buy all means, take your dollar bills and order the Asada tacos and a Margarita then call it an afternoon.  Should you be looking for a REAL MEXICAN FOOD experience with highly anticipated supreme flavors and substantial portions, do yourself a favor and pass on this place.",

My wife went to high school with the manager so she dragged me in for lunch today on our way home from the children's museum. Located on the east side of 7th street in a used to be house. A line to the door usually means it is good and it was!   We had to take the food togo so I was already thinking that it was going to be sub par. I was so wrong. I had two asada tacos and a bean and cheese burrito.  The tacos were perfect with the lime and the smokey salsa that came with them. The tortillas were soft but not soggy, the meat was smokey and tender and packed with flavor. The burrito was creamy and rich with melted cheese everywhere and beans that were not too heavy.   I can't wait to go back... and soon.  Thank you America's for making a no fuss slam dunk taco shop!",

Had the carne asada burrito. The meat was perfectly flavored and the burrito was freshly made. It could not have been better. Opted for the pricey Coca Cola from Mexico. Very good, but at $3 a bottle, a little pricey, especially where I tend to drink a lot of soda when I eat lunch. They now have a liquor license, so they offer a variety of Mexican brand beers. Sodas come in bottles and cans, depending on the brand. One nice option I liked was they accept credit cards, which at first isn't obvious. There are no signs that they take credit. The only way I knew was seeing a tiny magnetic strip reader next to the cash register. The restaurant is inside an old, small house, so there isn't a lot of room, and it's tough to find seating if you're more than a party of two. There is off-street parking behind the restaurant, but again, it's the back yard to an old home, so parking can be tight.",

The corn, however, was delicious and because it was I will be back! My coworkers got the torta and burrito and we all share nachos and salsa.

Now i make my home in the Coronado hood and felt I would give it another try. So for the past few weeks, I ran over a few blocks to grab some grub.  I ordered the carne asada burrito.  Same old burrito as before, undercooked tortilla, carne asada was GOOD, but barely any of it.  It was lunch time so I gave the cooks the benefit of doubt. Til the next week, I had a burrito and pastor tacos,  and the same thing as above.  The meat is GOOD, but I walked away feeling I missed something.  Oh!  Could it be the MEAT!  Tonight, I go up the street again. Why do I do this to myself, SHAME ON ME,  I know better.  I grabbed the special of the evening the torta pastor.  Torta has a big bun lots of flavorless green mayo (was that suppose to be avocado), and NO MEAT!  Okay 1/2 of cup of meat...it was GOOD meat, but in the words of Wendy's...Where's the beef?   I feel robbed,  my good green money was stolen and I handed it over to the \"FOOD\" thief in the little yellow house.  Bummer neighbor, bummer.  Where's a good roach coach when you need it?",

The place is not recommended dine in as it gives me the feeling of an indoor version of one of them mobile food wagons with some fold out benches setup. We ordered some carne asada tacos and some guacamole and chips and a few bottled cokes I believe.    The carne asada tacos portion of meat inside was small and the portions of guacamole,cabbage, and onions outweighed the 10 miniscule pieces of meat inside. The taco had almost a hint of peanut butter taste to the guacamole inside the tacos and dip which is disgusting. I am not sure if it was the crazy amount of cabbage that caused the taste but pretty gross. I am completely stunned how anyone can actually like the tacos or guacamole here as even chains like Rubio's have better street tacos(they aren't too shabby actually).  Service: 5/5 they were nice and prompt Ambiance: definitely take out unless you like picnics parking: pretty terrible if I recall food: 0/5 worst tacos I have ever had, guacamole also. I don't mean to be jaded but it was a terrible experience  There isn't many options so I didn't try too much here on the visit with my girlfriend and kid but I won't be going back and still don't know how in the world this could ever be ranked in any food critics reviews.",

I could see going back maybe their happy hour when they have some cheap tacos.  Employees that were there when I went, were not engaging at all and did not seem happy to be there at all.

They have plenty of options on the menu sure to please meat lovers, vegetarians, and I'm sure even vegans. Their beans don't have lard in them and all the ingredients are fresh. I enjoyed myself some chips and salsa and a bean and cheese burrito. The salsa that comes with the chips is UNREAL. That sealed the deal for me. Killer salsa= one way to my heart.  My burrito was the perfect size, the tortilla had the best flavor and texture, and it wasn't overly packed with cheese. One reason I can't stand eating burritos is the normally ridiculous amount of cheese included that makes me feel like 1-oil is seeping out of my every pore and 2- my arteries clogging from the greasiness. This burrito killed it! I'm kind of still thinking about it.  I can't wait to go back to try a veggie burrito and possibly a skinny margarita.",

We ordered a side of refried beans that was the ideal size for sharing and they were creamy and super tasty.

Choose from items such as tortas, quesadilla and tacos, and be sure to pair it with the great chips and perfectly spicy salsa, at a cheap $1.50 a basket.  I ordered a vegetarian extra-large bean and cheese burrito, and I was really impressed with how ooey-gooey the bean/cheese mixture was and how flaky the flour tortilla was. It was the perfect lunch portion and filled me up without bogging me down.  My pal ordered the carne asada taco, which he said was excellent as always.

Given that you now own the rights as being one of the best taco shops in Arizona, would you consider adding breakfast taco's to your menu? think about it- your lovely carne asada; some eggs; etc. I'm just thinking of options to add to your breakfast menu.

Burrito had the same soft flour tortilla and the refried beans (pintos) weren't super thick or super chunky. Cheese was melted and burrito came out HoT! Something else I can appreciate is that the beans aren't made with lard and you can tell by the taste. I wish we weren't just passing by and this was in Cali bc I would be a regular for sure!!!

This place has gone down hill, spent $28. 00 and I should have gone to Del taco the food is better and cheaper. The burrito had very and I mean very little meat and was bland at best. The tacos were tasteless. Big disappointment, there are a lot better taco joints in town, save your money and go elsewhere. Sad to see this used to be my go to place for tacos.",

    "text": "We finally tried this place because my brother in law and sister in law kept telling us how much they love it.  It is a small little house with a patio out front, which was perfect for the great weather the other day.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and a carne asada taco.  I am a self described burrito expert, and this burrito was a winner.  The tortilla was soft and flavorful, and the beans, which are not made with lard, were nicely mixed with cheese.  The taco was very good as well.   Like a good yelper, I checked in to this place when I got there.  There is a check-in offer for free chips and salsa.  When I showed it to the employee, she said I had to print it out in order to get the deal.  I told her that you can't print check-in offers; that they are meant to be used on your mobile device.  She pretty much told me that she wouldn't honor it.  Apparently the manager has not told anyone who works there about the check-in offer and how to use it, because she acted like I was a jerk for even asking about it.  She ended up giving us the free chips and salsa, but I could tell she thought she may get in trouble for giving it to me.  That manager should probably explain the check in offer so this doesn't keep happening.  Aside from that situation, the food was great, and I would definitely go back for more of those yummy beans!",

The horchata at America's is outstanding on its own, but adding a bit of coffee to it makes it even more delicious.    The other reason I find myself patronizing this restaurant so often is their tasty breakfast burritos, which are on special Saturday mornings.  I would give an additional star, but the service is often slooooooow, even when the restaurant is not very crowded.  I also think the menu pricing is a bit expensive for the portion size.",

They said they couldn't cause a manager wasn't there. What manager wouldn't open the store...ugh! So when we called later to see if they had credit the card back we waited on hold for 5 min then called back to wait more. Honestly, the burrito was good but not worth the unprofessionalism that this place showed! I would have rather gone to a berto's drive thru.

I have to also say that being from Michigan, my review is totally slanted by the fact that I drank a Coke with real sugar in it and chowed down on an awesome carne asada quesadilla on a sunny outdoor patio in mid-January. And really, I could care less if that influenced my review, because I was in love with the moment, and that's all that mattered.  Big time bonus points for the guy at the counter, who took my order, talked to me about the Creature From the Black Lagoon, and was in general very nice.

I don't know who voted or where this info was published but I don't really care, it was GOOD. Not chewy or rubbery or half burnt - flavorful and delicious.  I got the signature Vampiro Carne Asada taco with melted cheese, guac and carmelized onion. Just one, but could have eaten two for lunch with only minor regrets (my only complaint is that pulverized lettuce heap on top - any more pulsing in the food processor and that would have been lettuce mush). My dining mates got tortas, and raved.  As a Mexican food traditionalist, I balked at the \"Our beans do NOT contain lard!\" sign, but perhaps some more healthful diners out there (and vegetarians) would appreciate that bit of info. I also ordered an America's Corn - or Mexican Grilled Corn, which is grilled and slathered with mayo (hey, don't knock it til you try it), sprinkled with chili powder and rolled in grated cotija cheese. It was on special that day for $1, but I was immensely unimpressed. Too bad. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Gallo Blanco's version, as that baby'll knock your socks off. As a special treat (it was my bday after all) I picked up a Mexican coke - yummy out of a glass bottle and with cane sugar instead of chemical crap. We enjoyed the picnic-style patio seating (a little loud with 7th St just feets away) but otherwise a nice spot. Will def come back for a HH, which is $2 Mexican beers (Corona, Dos XX, Tecate, Pacifico) and I want to say $1 tacos but don't hold me to that.  I have to admit I am a fool for writing them off for a year due to their uninspired name and Dos Gringos-esque branding and atmosphere. But don't make my mistake; this place was fantastic.",

    "text": "I think I am more of a fan of the layout of the place. I love sitting outdoors and this has a great outdoor seating area so this was a plus for me.   The food was great, although all I had was a carne asada burrito...which was awesome. Also the chips and salsa were very good, the man who took our order at the register also came out later and asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa which I thought was  nice. If I did not get a large salsa with my chips I would have needed more to go with my burrito. Also, if I had not ordered the chips I might still be hungry because the burritos were a little on the small size. (Thanks Chipotle for ruining that for me)  I'm looking forward to going back for happy hour, and if you friend them on facebook I believe you get info on specials on certain days.   So if you are looking for a really great place to sit outside and have some great burritos and beer i would recommend this place first to anyone.",

The meat is flavorful and accompanied by soft bread, mayo, guacamole, lettuce, and sliced jalepeno the whole thing is heaven! For being a Saturday it was not busy so our wait for the food was very minimal. I got the ceviche to go and I started eating it as soon as I got home, I couldn't wait. I love a good ceviche and this one is not too spicy and the shrimp are still tender (haven't been sitting in the liquid too long and continue to \"cook\" and get tough). I will be back, too bad I have to drive a ways to get here!",

    "text": "I'm glad to see some yelpers hate this place and are not fooled by the hype.  I would like to write a review about the food but unfortunately I was never able to taste it.  Prior to the grand opening my wife and I stopped by several times misled by the signage.  Maybe \"open\" means cerrado in spanish  I don't know what the problem was.  After the real opening, we tried again, but it must have been a minor holiday and they were closed again.  My wife begged me again one night a good while after they really opened their doors and I said \"no way, they are closed\"  she insisted they were open so we went again.  I was surprised to see the festivities inside as we approached the door and couldn't wait to go inside.  Finally I was going to get to taste the most delicious silver dollar taco in Phoenix.  I kid you not, we were stopped at the door by a waitress \"no entrada\"  I laughed thinking it was a drunk girl screwing with me.  No, it was no joke, this gringo was being denied entry.  To complete my  own personal Jim Crow experience, I was told that I would be allowed to stay on the porch and eat in the cold.    \"Sorry, private party\".   There are so many good Mexican restaurants in this town, El Guerro Tortas, Regios, Pro's Ranch Market, Tradiciones,  Los Betos, Eribertos, Gallo Blanco....  There is no reason to set foot in America's Taco Shop, the place survives on hype alone, I hope they go under like all the other unfortunate casualties on 7th Street like Lisa G's, Cafe La Bella, Trente Cinq.  It's sad to see all three of them go. Honestly, if you want very good hard tacos go to Regios (1705 East Indian School) on the south side right where 51 intersects.    I'm guessing the honkies feel comfortable at America's because it's not too ethnic and it has a cute story behind the name.  Lastly, I have to question yelpers who give such a high rating for a well executed bean and cheese burrito.  UPDATE I incorrectly stated that I had never tasted the food. After some jogging of the memory, I recall that my wife brought take-out from America's home after work one night and I remember her opening the foil to reveal the smallest saddest driest street tacos I had ever seen.  The corn on the cob was delicious, though it was little consolation.  I think I had to go back out to pick up something substantial for dinner.  What a waste of time money and gas.",

The parking is in the back. I am glad I took a chance on it. America is a person and her Taco Shop is divine. It is a Mexican version of the Coronado Cafe. They have a limited menu around 10 entrees, but they are awesome. I had the Quesadilla De Carne Asada for $4.50, some chips and yummy Salsa, as well as some of the best Flan I have had and a Mexican Coke (the beverage). The counter help was attractive and efficient and I had food within minutes. I devoured it and could have eaten another Quesadilla, but I am a big eater. I liked the crowd too. Give it a shot before people find out about this place and you can't get a table.",

Now I am not a small appetite and it may be because the food is super good but the only downfall is the size of the tacos. However we both got the Taco Tuesday deal which you can't beat. The Carne was well marinated and cooked to perfection. The place is small so if you happen to go there on a hot summer day during a lunch rush you may not have the best experience however we sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a great lunch. This is one of my top go to spots for Carne Asada in Phoenix.  My colleague had been there before and got the Torta and said it was awesome as well!",
