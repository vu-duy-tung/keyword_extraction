The pizza was good, but not the best. There are so many varieties of pizza: thin crust, super thin crust, thick crust, deep dish, white pizza, etc. PB makes a basic, simple, light pizza with fresh and few ingredients. I would nominate it for the freshest pizza, but again not the best.",

I have to agree with Gayle King (Oprah's best friend)this is some of the best pizza in the USA. Soooo good!!!!",

I had the wise guy. The crust is crispy (just how I like it) but nothing else special about the pizza.  My kids had pasta and both were happy.   I would rather go to Grimaldi's, Oreganos, or LGO for pizza.  Also, the bill with tip was about $80 and we drank water.  That is a little steep for pizza and pasta for one adult and 2 kids.",

    "text": "Another excellent meal. Word is getting out around town about this place...last time we went, it was early-ish on  Saturday and there were maybe two or three other couples there. Tonight, Saturday, we arrived at 5:45 and were told it would be over an hour without a reservation. Fortunately, there were two seats at the bar, so we didn't have to wait.   The food was, again, spot on and delicious. The service was great and gracious, and Bianco was greeting and thanking diners left and right.   The choices are limited (or possibly nonexistent) for strict vegans, but there's always something vegetarian on the menu if you don't mind being a little flexible on the cheese thing.  We shared the chickpea-flour crepe with olive, sage and red onion. This was fabulous, reminiscent of a potato pancake but more delicate.   I ordered the Fresh pasta with eggplant ragu, which was velvety with deep, garlicky, parmesan, and husband had the gnocchi with fresh corn. Also terrific.  There's a rotating menu, but I think there's always some variation of a bean side dish. Get it. The two we've had have been excellent. Also, the flourless chocolate cake is a must, and I think they have it every night.   Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!",

It was my first time but we went because she raves about the food. We got the margherita pizza, gnocchi and paperdelle. All that was left were about 5 gnocchi when we were done. The bolognese sauce was outstanding, pasta was cooked to perfection. The gnocchi were the softest, most pillow-y I've ever had and some had a light crispness on the outside. The pizza was incredibly fresh and light. I wish we had one of these in California because I would go all of the time. The outside patio is so cute for a date night. You won't be disappointed!",

I wouldn't say they are rude but definitely not friendly either. My friend and I were sharing a chocolate cake and a waiter( not even ours) came by and took the empty plate literally as soon as I put down my fork without even asking.  At first, I thought some random stranger took something off the table until the guy walked into the back.  The food has very high quality ingredients and you can really taste the quality. That being said, this is not regular pizza. It seems more like something you might eat in Italy. Some people might like Americanized pizza better. I do.   Finally, the menu is small. Very small. Not many choices. The wine selection is much larger than their food menu.",

I even took some friends and the father is Italian so I could make sure I had an even perspective but at the end it was sort of...eh, okay, but we've both had lots better.  The restaurant is right in the same shopping center as the Trader Joe's near Camelback avenue in North Phoenix, and that is a pretty cool place. The restaurant is set up as a sort of casual rustic italian sort of place, like the ones I've seen in Naples and that is a nice bit of Italian drama theater, though taking it to the point of serving the wine in small water glasses, a little too authentic. If I'm going to buy a decent bottle of wine, give me a real wine glass. Sorry if it blows the mood but its not the same without a decent wine glass.  I started out with the watermelon and fennel salad, as it seemed it would be cool and refreshing for summer and while it was okay, a bit warm for my tastes, I would have liked it a bit more chilled...wait...sorry, review unfinished and that was a few weeks ago so.....lets just say, relative to the price, I didn't think it was all that great, nothing I had felt like this place was worth a second visit.",

    "text": "I was excited to hear Bianco opened a new restaurant at Town and Country. It was Monday and I didn't bring my lunch to work so I thought I'd treat myself and check it out right away!   Sort of disappointed. I was craving really good homemade pasta. I got the potato gnocchi and I thought was going to be a bolognese sauce but it was more of a chopped/shredded pork sauce (I wouldn't really call it sauce) with heavy citrus and parsley flavor (maybe I misread the menu). Anyways, it wasn't what I was hoping for - pretty heavy for a hot day in May!  I ordered the bread/olive oil too.  And just water. With a tip it came to $20.   Just a little more than I'd like to pay - even when I'm treating myself - but I'm willing to do it if it's good and I'm craving it!   Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon. And I'll definitely either wait until it is cooler and the heavy entrees are more appropriate or I'll order a salad!  Also the service could be a little better. It wasn't very crowded so I got a table right away but it did take awhile to place my order. I asked my waitress what were the best pastas and was hoping she would have explained them in some more detail. She just said the gnocchi was her favorite and I went with that. Next time I'll be asking more questions for sure!   On a positive note, I love the location, decor and atmosphere.  Just wonder if it's a little too pricey/specialized for that location, considering what else is in that complex. The neighboring restaurants aren't really on the same level, attracting the same people.   But, I wish them luck and hope to find something to RAVE about next time I venture to try it again!",

The place just didn't make us feel overly welcome and the pizza came out without the toppings we asked for.  The server offered it up on the side which took about 5 extra minutes which is fine but they then charged us separately for the addition.  When we asked to split the bill 3 ways at the end, the server took the tab back seemingly hastily.  Not a super friendly feel here.  The pizza was good but can get better for the high price.

However, when in Pizzeria Bianco you have to order a pizza!  It would be sacrilegious not to!  I'm not too fond of the draft selections since there were only 2, but I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a wine and pizza joint.  We ordered the Margarita Pizza.  Overall, it was pretty good - firewood baked pizza pie in a stone oven; you really can't beat that quality!  The aroma of the basil, the stringy mozzarella cheese, and the sweetness of the tomato sauce is enhanced by the toasty smell of the firewood! Yum!    The service was very good!  There were several people that attended to us, but seem like they were all in sync and willing to help to make our experience so much better!  The place itself is different from the one downtown.  This one had more of a farm home feel with a touch of spring!  In the end, a must visit next time your around the Biltmore area! - Enjoy!",

Now in their defense, I hear the downtown location is better, but if you are going to Chain your establishment, you should be able to reproduce the same quality food.  It wasn't \"bad\", it just was not worth the money. I would prefer Federal Pizza, Humble Pie, Spinato's, ZPizza or Papa Johns and saved some mullah!  I may try downtown sometime, but I am not in a rush.",

The  is large and comfortable, with several areas for individuals, small groups and larger groups, as well as ample outdoor seating. The wait staff is courteous and ly. We were all seated at a long table that accommodated all 17 of us. Everyone first received whatever drinks they wanted, most had either water or iced tea, plates of bread and oil were then served.  The menu is one page with only a few items, sandwiches, pasta, , salad. Our waitress started at one end and took everyone's order in turn.

Toppings were sparse and the first bite removed most of the cheese from the slice. The tomato sauce was good, but I had to add some red pepper to give it a little kick.

They only warned people via Facebook which I unfortunately did not see.  I was happy to be able to try this place again on Friday though..finally! Loved the shabby chic look, very cute. We were greeted by a friendly hostess, and our server was absolutely excellent as well. I got the Field Greens salad and me and my boyfriend split a pizza which was half Marinara (For me!) and half Sonny Boy.  I liked the bread they brought out, yum! The salad was $8 which seemed a little ridiculous for what we got. The greens tasted very fresh though. The dressing on it was a bit too salty for my taste, but it was edible. I was torn between getting the Margharita or Marinara, but decided I wasn't in the mood for cheese so I got the Marinara. The flavors of the marinara sauce with the fresh sliced garlic and basil was incredible. One complaint: the crust was a little too floppy and soggy towards the middle. The outer part was good though! My BF got the Flourless Chocolate Cake for dessert. I tried a bite, it was very rich. Pretty good, but the portion was very small for the price.  This is the only Pizzeria Bianco location that I have tried out, and I enjoyed it. I would be interested in trying the crazy busy downtown one!",

I would give it five stars for the ambiance and decor - it's a quaint, rustic place and I loved everything about how it looks!  Be sure to dress warm though - they use the outside seating as the waiting area. There are a few heaters, but it's still chilly out! Thankfully, we only had to wait about 20 minutes.  For our starer, we ordered the salad with mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto and though the mozzarella was very good, the salad was somehow too salty. The bread and vinegar was delish. I believe my roommate said the vinegar was the best part of the meal - which I agree with. It was an extra $2, but if you're going to order bread, then it's worth it.  I ordered the spaghetti and was disappointed. I prefer angel hair pasta and this was thick pasta with nothing special to the sauce or noodles. Thankfully, we ordered a side of meatballs - those were amazing and really helped the spaghetti. I also tried the gnocchi that my friend ordered and thought it was terrible - very bland.   We all split the flourless cake for dessert. It was okay - but tasted more like a brownie than a cake. It had a pure coco flavor just lightly sweetened, which was unexpected but good. However, it would have been better if were truly a cake.  Since I live nearby and loved the atmosphere, I'll definitely be back, but hopefully will find something I like besides the meatballs, bread & vinegar.",

The tables and chairs seem to be old wooden antiques which add a unique touch. However, you'll need an Italian dictionary to translate the menu. Not sure why they can't explain the food in English but I guess they wanted to portray a pretentious, upmarket vibe. I decided to keep it simple and ordered a margherita pizza to share with my wife. Disappointingly, the slices were literally wafer thin - I had never seen a pizza like this before - and you pay $15 for the privilege. In fact, everything on the menu seemed overpriced. I noticed a beer for $18 which I can only assume consisted of liquid gold.   The restaurant obviously aims to cater for wealthy socialites who place more emphasis on being seen eating in hip eateries while gossiping over wine rather than the food itself. My advice: go to Dominos instead, where you can get a large pizza for $7 that won't leave you starving afterwards.",

    "text": "After years of boycotting the downtown location because of the arrogant service and ludicrous lines,we finally tried the new location on Camelback. The place looked like a hipster joint, with dim lighting and a long bar, where we waited about 5 minutes to be seated. We were led into the second room, which was completely different to the first room. It looked a Disney version of a French drawing room. Hardly what you would associate with a pizza joint. There was something lacking - the room was to big for the furniture, weirdly lit and just sort of ...empty.  Anyway we were seated at a window looking out on to the empty storefront across from the restaurant. The service was okay and our waiter explained the very small menu adequately.  I ordered a Margherita pizza with Fennel sausage added and my wife ordered he Biancoverde, a white pizza with several cheeses and some Arugula on top. Once the food was delivered no-one approached us at all to inquire as to our satisfaction or concerns  The bottom line is that the PIzza was underwhelming. In the years since Bianco first came to national attention and was named the best pizza in Phoenix, some serious competition has arisen, not least of which is Pomo in Scottsdale (with a small downtown offshoot), Grazie in Old Town Scottsdale and Il Bosco in mid Scottsdale, all who make much better authentic Neapolitan style PIzza than PB, and at reasonable, appropriate pricing for dough, cheese and some toppings.  We left feeling like we had wasted a hour and spent more money than we received value for.",

    "text": "I love Pizza Bianco, but this location is really exceptional, if not mostly for its accessibility. Easy parking, in a much more interesting part of town/shopping center, and though I never have had to wait for a seat at the bar at Heritage Square, you're almost guaranteed to get a seat here any time of day. Much more user friendly all around; I haven't even bothered with the downtown Bianco in 2 years...   The space itself is much different than Heritage Square. Bigger, seating isn't nearly as tight, gorgeous bar and a more rustic country vibe than brick and mortar hole in the wall.   The pizzas are just as they are downtown, which is excellent. The Rosa, Sonny Boy and Wiseguy are all fantastic in their own right.  Always order 2 straight away, because another slice is inevitable when it's this good. Perfectly thin, crisp on the outside but airy on the inside crust that has just the right amount of chewiness. Good sauce, and top shelf cheese and toppings. They really fire on all cylinders when it comes to knocking out amazing pizzas.   Only a few beers on tap, but they're decent enough local brews that are adequate accompaniments. My girlfriend digs the espresso.   Service is always fairly good, but they are always busy, so some misses are par for the course from time to time.   If you love pizza, this is a must do. One of the best spots in the country for exceptional pizza.",

    "text": "I've loved Pizzeria Bianco more than I've loved some of my friends.  I'd never been to Bianco's Town & Country location until Thursday night... and I am kicking myself for it now.  We arrived just before 8:30 to the satellite of Pizzeria Bianco, which housed Bianco's Italian Restaurant and now is split into Trattoria Bianco and the pizzeria.   We chose to sit at the bar and order a pizza.  Of course, we ended up ordering my favorite pizza... the Biancoverde.  Additionally, we got curious about the Rustichella Spaghetti.  So... we ordered that, too.  The pizza arrived first and I am sure I was not the only one who heard it calling out sweet nothings to me as I took my first bite.  Perfection in a pizza?  Yes, I should say so.  Next, the spaghetti arrived.  It was unassuming, but I dug right in.  If I could have spoken... I would have screamed out a number of curse words followed by \"That's the best pasta I have EVER had.\"    The spaghetti was so simple, but Bianco's pomodoro and parmesan sauce was perfection with the perfect heavy hand of basil.  I'm not even a basil fan... but it was amazing in this dish.  No joke, we nearly licked the plate clean of sauce.  That kind of goodness could never be replicated at home... unless perhaps I got the best parm, Bianco's tomatoes and the freshest basil from a heavenly garden.  Yes, yes, yes!  It was that good.  The ambience was great.  This place gives you a little more elbow room than the Adams St location.    Next up?  The Trattoria!",

I've spent time not only in the kitchen trying to recreate Italy from a long ways away, but also walking the streets of Rome eating pizza 4 times a day. On a scale of 10, my pizza gets a 5, average American pizza a 2-3, and pizzaria Bianco a 7-8. There is better in the world, but not much better in the USA. The Margaretta is the way to go, substantially better than the wise guy. Pricy, but not nearly as much as a trip to Italy.",

I had the margherita pizza with half mushrooms and it was delicious both ways. Thin, crisp crust with excellent \"bite\". My boyfriend had the Biancoverde - a white pizza with several cheeses and topped with an entire salad of arugula. We were a little surprised by the mountain of greens, but both fully agreed that the flavor addition was ideal to balance out the really pungent, flavorful cheeses. We ate there on Sunday night and had no wait at all. Ordered and had piping hot pies in front of us in - no lie - 7 minutes flat. We weren't hungry for dessert but the server told us to try the flourless chocolate cake. We followed his advice and I almost licked the plate clean. The vanilla cream sauce on the cake was divine. There was no downside to this meal!",

    "text": "Ah, I remember the first time I went to Pizzeria Bianco.  A group of us went to their downtown Heritage Square location and ordered every pizza and antipasto on the menu.  The one I fell in love with was the Rosa.  Rosa stole my heart.  So it's been quite a few good years since I last visited Pizzeria Bianco and we decided to stop by last night to rekindle the romance with Rosa and a Wiseguy.  Rosa (Red onion, parmesan, rosemary, AZ pistachios), $16:  Did you not read the description?  This pizza is DIVINE!  That parmesan is salty and granular so don't be expecting any cheese drag action.  I love the crunch the pistachio gives and that rosemary is subtle but fragrant.  This isn't your typical pizza and I love it.  Wiseguy (Wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage), $19:  The Wiseguy is everything you want in a pie.  The house-made mozzarella is so delicious and the fennel sausage is a flavor explosion.  Still a straight-forward and simplistipic pie that'll have your skirt flippin'!  This Biltmore location is decent.  It's bigger and more spacious but the service isn't so great.  The staff is more interested in talking to each other than checking on your meal.  I think I like the original Heritage Square location more.  What else can I say?  Chris Bianco is brilliant.  It's no wonder how he has won a James Beard Foundation Award for best Southwest Chef and no small feat that Pizzeria Bianco is named one of the best pizzerias in the country by Bon Appetit.  So come and get some pizza!  You won't be disappointed.",

The onions were just incredibly overwhelming and look like they were cut for a pizza 10x this size. I was also incredibly disappointed by the iced tea, it has this foul taste that I couldn't stand. I don't think I've ever been disappointed by something as simple as iced tea but there's a first time for everything.   The service was also incredibly slow. There was only one server working and the hostess didn't seem interested in helping him do anything. It took forever to get our drinks and the check.

Like all Bianco locations, the ingredients are bought fresh from local farmers and prepared daily.   The location itself is lovely and airy, at night you almost feel like you're sitting at a bistro in a small village. During the day its filled with light from the large windows covering two walls, and the open door to the wrap around patio outside. These things would have been nice had they not meant that while sitting inside we were bombarded with flies and gnats.   The staff was very polite and excited to expand on anything we had questions about.

Years later, we found ourselves in Phoenix again with Pizzeria Bianco high up on our list of places to try.  We shared the following pies:  -margherita ($15): tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil. Hands down, this is probably the best margherita pizza I have ever had. The tomato sauce had a nice bite, and I loved how fresh the mozzarella tasted. I ate my pizza with bites of anchovy, so the saltiness of the anchovies added another layer of flavor.  -wise guy ($18): wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage. This pizza is sauceless, which didn't matter. I really liked the smokiness of the cheese, and the sausage had a good snap. I personally like the sweet tinge of the onions, but my sister wasn't a fan of their substantial size.  Our dining experience was lackluster. Our waiter was nice, but was not very informative. We overheard from the waiter from neighboring tables rattle off the history of the menu, the daily specials, and what was in season and what was not etc. Our lunch experience was curt and short.   Pizzeria Bianco was good, but not mind blowingly good.",

    "text": "After more than a few visits to this Pizzeria Bianco location, I can say that I'm a fan for sure...  The decor in this place if great - from the moment you walk in, you'll forget you're in a strip mall in Phoenix and feel more like you're dining in someone's house!  I've been here on dates with my husband, double dates, and even small groups, and I've never had a bad meal.  Service, food quality, and atmosphere are all consistently solid!  I typically go for some red wine with my meals at PB, but they have a cocktail menu also.    I recommend going here and eating family style.  Depending on the seasonal menu, start with a salad (I like the Simple Greens), and a few sides (ie: olives, vegetables and/or sausage).  Make sure you also get the fresh Bianco bread with olive oil!  From there, go for some pizza... We like the traditional Margherita and the Sonny Boy, but I don't think you can go wrong!  Lastly, try an entree or pasta or both... it's all good, I swear!  And if you have room, end with some of their homemade dessert!  Pizzeria Bianco has come a long way from having just their original downtown Phoenix location... I've been to all three Phoenix locations as well as the one in Tucson and never been disappointed.  Buon Appetito!",

Perhaps if we had not had other experiences with Napolitano style pizza previously, we would have been happy.  The salad starter was just greens with a nice vinaigrette and some of the best olives I've ever had.  We tried the Sonnyboy and found the crust to be a good combo of chewy and crispy, but the sauce was bland and the sopressata was only ok and could've had a little more spice.  The service was good and appropriate, but not friendly.  I don't know that we will be back as there are other better napolitano style pizzas in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I only ever went to Bianco at its original location once. I vaguely recall a pizza that was pretty darn good - but that eating experience was so overwhelmed by the ridiculous 3-hour wait to be seated (and what can only be described as the \"deeply unconcerned\" attitude of the waitstaff) that I vowed to never go back.  Sometime between then and now (many, many years) I found Jeff Varasano's Neopolitan pizza website and fell in love with the pizzamaking process. I've had a lot of good Neopolitans too - and in Phoenix! Pizza a Metro, La Piazza - even Grimaldi's is fantastic if you ask me.   Also during this time, Bianco made national headlines as the \"Best Pizza in America.\" Over and over and over. For my part, I did NOT care - wild horses could not have dragged me back to Bianco after my original experience there.  Recently though, I was shocked to realize that Bianco had opened up a second location near me! And it wasn't busy! I made a mental note to myself, and the following weekend the wife and I went for a visit. After all I have been through I know a lot more, I'm more prepared to love this pizza, and I don't have to deal with the ridiculous wait! Fantastic!  What a shame to have to report that the experience failed on every single possible level.   We arrived for a late lunch at about 1:30 on a Sunday figuring we would be past whatever rush might exist. It seemed we were right. There was one table with two very noisy people seated at it. Naturally, we were seated immediately next to them in this otherwise empty space. Mere minutes later, a family came in with three screaming children, who were promptly seated next to us on our other side. Because of the screaming kids, I could no longer quite make out the other table's noisy conversation! An excellent start!  The menu is sparse. Most restaurants do overkill. Bianco does the opposite of overkill. Four pizzas (five?) and if you don't like those, there are half a dozen toppings that you can add - or can you build your own? It wasn't clear. Appetizers? None of that. I asked the waitress if all they offered in the way of appetizers were the three salads on the menu, and she attempted to explain to me how the salads were in fact appetizers. Yeah, I already said that. But that wasn't the question. So three salads, five pizzas. I think a few pastas, but who wants pasta with pizza?  While we waited, we were brought some crusty bread and olive oil, the bread was too crusty and the olive oil could have seriously used some balsamic to go with it - but we were glad to have something to nibble on while we waited for everyone else in the restaurant to get drinks before we were even asked if we wanted any. When we did get our drinks, they came in cans, with dental office sized drinking glasses filled with ice. Just like being on an airplane! Genius!  We were (eventually) asked what we would like to order. We opted for the Sonny Boy (there is only one size pizza, naturally) and something called \"simple local greens\" or something similarly pompous. We received them both at the exact same time (so much for that appetizer theory!) and we were equally unimpressed by both. The salad consisted entirely of chewy, bitter greens dressed meagerly with olive oil and vinegar. Seriously dry. I love salads. I could barely choke this down and it went largely uneaten. Seriously, my wife will tell you. I'll murder an entire salad plate. Not this one.  But the pizza! The glorious, \"Best in America\" pizza! Right? This has to be a joke. Am I being punked? Unsubstantial, salty to a fault and completely forgettable. It was more like eating a cracker with pizza toppings than an actual pizza. The tomato sauce was good - just tomatoes really, very simple - which is OK with me. But every other aspect of this pizza was a complete and utter failure. No such thing as too thin? Wrong. This pizza was hardly there. This ain't a Neopolitan thing. This is just stingy. And it's not good! No chew to it at all. Very little in the way of cheese but both the sopresatta and olives were way too salty in any case.   I wish this could have gone way differently. I wanted to believe. But there is a lot of good pizza in Phoenix now and wait or no wait, there is no need to try and find it here. This place has a lot of name cache - but that's it. I have no idea how it has sustained this level of interest for this long. The menu is weird, the food is barely mediocre and the staff do not seem to have adequate training.  What I can say is that despite their obliviousness in seating us, the waitstaff at this location were at least pleasant. I could not say that about the experience at the original location I had years ago, so that at least is a step up.",

    "text": "Best Pizza Ever, Hands Down  I had some shopping to do at Town & Country Plaza, but hadn't had a thing to eat all day. I saw the sign for Pizzeria Bianco and decided to see if they were too busy to accommodate me. (I had heard that there was always a line to get in.)  Well, it was apparently my lucky day. When I entered the restaurant, I was promptly shown to a nice seat at the bar and provided with ice water and a lunch menu.   The menu wasn't large, and my eye immediately focused on the pizza selections. There were 6 pizza offerings, 3 with red sauce, and 3 without. I wanted something straightforward, so I settled on the pizza margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil) and asked them to add garlic. I was assured that the crust would be thin and crisp. I also ordered a glass of the house red wine, and settled in to wait.  While I was waiting, the couple next to me generously offered to share their pizza with me since they had more than they could eat. I let them know I appreciated the offer, but that I was reserving my appetite to be able to finish my own pizza.   It came out moments later, and looked perfect. Biting into my first slice was even better. The crust was super thin, crisp, and tasty. This was not going to be one of those pizzas where part of the crust would be left on the plate. Every bit of each slice demanded to be eaten. the tomato sauce was just acidic enough, and married well with the fresh mozzarella, basil, garlic and the crust. Each mouthful was light and delightful. There was nothing heavy at all about my pizza. I was glad that I had kept it simple rather than ordering a pizza heavy with ingredients.   Pizza devoured, I became curious about the dessert offerings. I hadn't seen any on the menu, and so had to quiz my server about the possibilities. I settled on a pear tart, garnished with a dip of nutmeg Italian ice. The pear tart was nice, but the nutmeg Italian ice was out of this world. Yum!!! It almost tasted perfumed with the nutmeg, and slightly custardy. I didn't even need the pear tart.  I have to go back again for the pizza, but I don't intend to leave without having the nutmeg Italian ice again. My entire lunch was such a treat. This is now at the top of my list for best pizza.   The service, while very friendly, was a little spotty. I wasn't sure at several points, who was supposed to be taking care of me, and about the time I finished my pizza, everyone disappeared. I had to solicit someone to discuss dessert, and again, to pay my check. I enjoyed my meal so much that I really didn't mind too much.  ------------------------------------------------Second Visit 9/8/15------------------------------- OK, I am now still a fan of the pizza, but NOT a fan of the service.  It was worse than spotty this time.  I was able to place my order, but then there was apparently a shift change.  Someone did bring me the piping hot pizza I had ordered - and it was perfect again - but then no check back to see how it was, no service period until someone finally noticed my plate pushed away and came to take it around 10 minutes after I had finished.  It wasn't busy, there were all kinds of staff standing around across the room talking to each other.  I stand by the pizza, but the service was so poor that I cut way back on my tip.",

Service was quick and friendly and they took us right on time for our reservation, which were also pluses yet...another downside was the acoustics of the room we were seated in. It was a large room and I do not think it was the people in it but something about the hard surfaces or shape made it one of the loudest dining experiences I have had in a long time. It was actually hard to have a conversation with the people sitting across from me.",

Having already visited the Pizzeria, Pane, and Italian Restaurant for lunch myself this was my first dinner at a Bianco restaurant and arriving to find the space bustling we opted to sit outdoors in order to avoid the noise; a big mistake that instead led to both captain and a server named Adam largely ignoring us throughout the evening as water went unfilled, dishes were dropped off without description, ingredient questions required further investigation with the kitchen, and epic delays occurred between each course, plate pickup, and particularly drop-off and collection of desserts along with the check.  Moving past service issues, the food was every bit as good as the first visit, the housemade pastas and bread clearly a strong point while fresh local produce shined in a salad with bright, bold vinaigrette and beets sweeter than almost any I'd previously encountered.  Unfortunately replacing my all-time favorite corn and pancetta gnocchi with a slightly more seasonal version featuring brown butter and sage the dumplings themselves once again melted in the mouth while the crespelle, a crepe stuffed to bursting with creamy cheese and bitter escarole, topped with Bianco's signature sauce was rustic, simple, and  perfect - just the way Italian food should be and just the way Chris and his team make it at each of their restaurants.",

Bianca had a very sparse menu, but with all the hype we thought we would give it a try. Big mistake. I was surprised that the inside looked a little dingy. And, very loud.   Wanted an appetizer like calamari but was told they had no seafood products.  The waiter was very busy but did a good job checking on us and running around. I really was hoping for a good pizza and ordered the margarita pizza with fennel sausage and a beer. My wife ordered Pappardelle an a glass of wine.   The waiter brought us bread and a saucer of what was supposed to be melted butter?  Someone must have taken all the flavor from it before it got to us. $7 Beer was tasty though. $14 glass of wine was good too.   The Pappardelle (about two cups of overly done mushy noodles and a meat sauce) was well under par for an $18 entree dish. No salad.   Pizza... I was expecting 12\" of something special for $20. Looked like the cook was blindfolded when he made it or maybe shook it around before serving it.  If you like super thin cracker crust with very little on it, then this is for you.   So, we ate very little and stopped back at Grassroots.  Took the Bianca leftovers to my mother in law ;  )",

But my advice, if you go here, get the entrees, pastas, and appetizers. Plus, they have a legit italian cherry soda. Oh, and their chocolate cake, and creme brulee was outstanding!",

    "text": "For my 100th review, I'd figure to write a review on a establishment that Phoenix is known for, and visitors from out of state would ask me....Is Pizzeria Bianco really the best pizza in the US?  For that question, I can not truly say YES or NO, but if you enjoy pizza, this place is worth a try.  For me, I think the simplicity of the pizza and the quality of the ingredients really shined through!  The tomato and mozzarella was fresh and crisp, the pizza was thin and crispy, yet had that nice chew you get from pizza that has great dough!  The sauce had a hint of sweetness and the basil on the margarita was fresh and delicious.  We ordered several pizzas to share and some salads to go along.  Overall, I was pretty impressed, we had a reservation so we didn't wait very long.  I'm not quite sure if its worth a 2 hour wait though.  I see reviews where people waited that long at times.  I would definitely come back for this pizza.  Little pricey, but nice ambiance and they have a bar next door if you want to get a drink.",

I decided to go back for pasta another night and again I was very pleased. Oh and I had another piece of the flourless chocolate cake. I was only there for a week so I had to indulge a little.

    "text": "First to review!  I had to say it.  Everyone and their mom knows about this place.  Did you know there is now a 2nd location?  This one just recently opened its doors.  I gotta say, if you haven't been able to get downtown to try this place out yet I would definitely check out this location.  We were seated immediately (on a Tuesday night).  When we left there was a line but regardless it is much less busy than the downtown location.  This location also takes reservations!  Keep that in mind for those busy Friday and Saturday nights.  Alright, lets get down to the pizza.  I had the Wiseguy.  I always have the wiseguy.  It has a delicious smoky flavor to it that you cant get anywhere else.  I have tried about 3 of the pizzas here and have not had a bad one yet.  The prices are a little high (as in $18 for a personal pizza), but whats wrong with splurging every once in a while?  That being said, I have to compare this place to some of my other favorite spots in the area.  The other two juggernauts, The Parlor and LGO, are right around the corner.  The Parlor is still my #1 pizza joint around here.  You can't beat their meat & cheese plates.  I would say LGO and Bianco are tied for #2.  LGO has a great vibe and neighborhood location.  Also its closer to my house.    You need to try all 3 places and judge for yourself.  They are now all relatively close to each other and are by far the best 3 pizza joints in Phoenix.  Its the only way to truly know!",

    "text": "In a city that loves its strip malls and chain restaurants, Pizzeria Bianco is an oasis in the desert.  Amongst the shimmery mirage of Cheesecake Factories, Sweet Tomatoes', and Papa Johns', Mr. Bianco has managed to thrive, opening not only a second restaurant, but a third shop specializing in sandwiches made with house baked bread.  Before I get too sentimental, there were flaws in my experience. As others have mentioned, the service is a bit brusque.  And unless you like wincefully salty and overly greasy things, you'll want to avoid the spiedini ($10) which is the sad marriage of two prosciutto wrapped logs of cheese.  On the other hand, the margherita ($13) pizza was a thing of beauty.  The creamy mozzarella was still bubbling when it hit my table and I could smell the fragrant basil before the pizza even arrived.  The sauce tasted as it should - fresh and bright with the deeply savory thrum of good quality tomatoes nudged just so with herbs and salt.  Above all, the crust was flawless - structurally sound enough to eat a slice without fork and knife, yet light and pliant.  There was the familiar calico pattern of an expertly fired char, and the crackly crisp yet wholesome corcione (the fancy pants Italian term for the crust) was one of the best executed I've seen outside New York City and Naples.  I regret that chain restaurants seem to be the new way of American eating.  But that lowering of expectations makes it even more exciting to find a restaurant that doesn't take short cuts, keeps the bar high, strives for perfecting the craft, keeps it real and is thus-ly rewarded.",

    "text": "Bianco used to own the market on artisan pizza in Phoenix, and in some opinions, all of the USA. In the past few years a number of artisan pizza spots have opened which are bringing Pizzeria Bianco some competition. Still, few compare to what Pizzera Bianco keeps delivering to the table time and time again.   I've been told by more than one person the pizzas here are \"Amazing\", \"spectacular\", \"the best anywhere\", and so on. While I did enjoy the thin crust and the fresh, flavorful toppings and ingredients, I was not completely blown away by the pizza here. I think the trouble is that there is *s*o*  *m*u*c*h* hype around these pizzas, it's impossible to go into this expecting anything other than \"the absolute, hands down, best meal you've ever eaten\". When you get to the other side of your dining experience, you find the meal just didn't quite live up to your expectations.  With that said, there's only one spot in Phoenix I like better than Bianco, and that's Federal. I'm not going to tell you it's the most amazing meal you'll ever eat, but in the world of artisan pizza, it's seriously hard to beat. I'd implore you to try Bianco for yourself, go in with appropriate expectations of a \"really good pizza\" and you won't be underwhelmed like I was.   If you feel like taking this Yelper's advice, stop in here for a pizza, go out and try the rest, then create your own informed, flavor filled opinion.  Happy Yelping Phoenix! Go eat pizza :-)",

Where on earth is the best pizza is a slipery slope and i am not getting on it.  The whole thing is, however, very cool.  They have a person in the window smashing tomatos into sauce.

I'm rating it  based on the quality of the pizza ingredients and the bread with dipping oil, and the lack of anything tacky in the surroundings.  Also, the waiter was completely unobjectionable.  I thought my chair was a little too heavy and awkward; try sitting against the wall instead of out in the middle to avoid this problem.  If you like to fill up when you eat, you will need to order more than just a pizza; maybe get dessert, because these pizzas are on the small side.  If you want something very basic to eat, you will surely walk away hungry.  If this place sold hot chocolate, you wouldn't find regular hot cocoa; you would have to choose from three premium flavors, and if you couldn't face imported amaretto, organic hazelnut or mint grown on Mt. Everest, you'd be straight out of luck.  All the pizzas have such fancy toppings that I doubt most children would be interested in it.  I was there for a business lunch, and I am satisfied that my companion went away with a positive impression that Phoenix has high-quality, specialty pizzas.",

Besides having arguably the best pizza in a 600 mile radius, the best fresh mozzarella in the valley, ultra fresh ingredients, and hop knot on tap, you can essentially walk into this place and get seated immediately any night.  I have never waited.  The service is always good at this location in my experience.  One thing about the pizza here.  It's an exercise in control and attention to detail.  The crust is always prefect, with some nice blistering and char. The mozzarella is lush and fresh.  The tomato sauce is simple and perfect.  By dialing in all the finest details, this place pumps out world class pies... I literally feeling like hugging the dude running oven duty every time I take my first bite.  This is my go to Bianco location.",

The restaurant's decorations are charming, eclectic, and the outside seating area quite nice given it's basically in a retail alley.  My husband and I shared a white pizza with pistachios & onions that was served hot, crusty & was delicious.  (They bring fresh bread and olive oil to the table while you're waiting on the order).  For a custom-made pizza, I had asked for mushrooms on my half of the pizza, the service was pretty darn fast.  My only suggestion would be to add a few more inventive side salads to the menu, but overall highly recommended.",

This new location is nice because there isn't usually a wait and they have the same menu as the other location....plus it's right by my yoga studio (cuz after yoga, I need some pizza...duh!). I went with my mom and we shared their super simple salad, which was good, but plain with just a light vinaigrette, and we had a half bianco verde half rosa pizza. The pizza was soooo good. Better than I remember from the other location (the lack of the wait time may have helped too). I like that these pizzas are very different than others in Phoenix....local pistachios on a pizza? Come on! Is it the best pizza in town? No...but it's definitely worth a try!  PS this may sound really dumb, but I had some leftovers and later that night I popped them in the micro in the plastic container and the container melted to the pizza...I was pretty devastated, so don't be dumb like me....safety first, use a plate :-P",

    "text": "Had a late dinner here with a couple of friends.  Our server greeted us, explained about the menu and suggested that for the 3 of us, if we want pizza, we should order 2 or 3.  What the...??   1 would be suffice, especially if we would like to have a variety of dishes to share.  We ended up with their Market Salad, which was delicious.  Not dressed heavily, and was very refreshing.  We also ordered the Pappardelle with grass fed beef bolognese.  It was tasty but the pasta was cooked beyond al dente, which made the dish taste like something I can get from a Maggiano's.  Since Pizza Bianco is known for their pizzas, we just had to sample one and went with the Rosa, which is vegetarian, and added a roasted mushrooms.  We were served the pizza, and the server then said that the side of mushrooms will be ready in a minute or so.  Whoops.  Guess one has to be clearer when ordering and indicate the addition of mushrooms is for the pizza.  She apologized and replaced the pizza with one would include the mushrooms.   The pizza we got then had the mushrooms, but the underside of the pizza was almost completely charred/burnt.  We inquired and were able to send it back.  They fired up one more pizza, and this time it was done well.  The combination of the ingredients of the Rosa was very tasty.    Appreciated the staff wanting to make sure that we enjoyed all of food.",

The crust stands up and stays crispier longer then most wood fired pizzas.  We took a big group and they did an amazing job.    We had the biancoverde pizza. Ricotta, mozzarella, olive oil base and arugula.  5 stars.   Margherita pizza was perfect. Mozzarella,sauce and basil. Simple and great. 5 stars   The parpadelle Bolognese was absolutely perfect. The noodles were cooked well and the sauce was great.  6 stars if I could.   The gnocchi special with sausage was tasty.  5 stars.   The Antipasto was also very good. Salami, goat cheese and warm vegetables. 5 stars.   Mozzarella and tomato salad 4 stars.   Spedini skewers.  Fontina wrapped in prosciutto cooked in the wood oven. 5 stars.   Braciole special. Our least favorite. Tender and fall apart but dry. The polenta and sauce were dynamite. More like pot roast then the dish I grew up eating. 3 stars.   Great place with good service. Will be back when I am in town.",

Not even the top 10.  But that's just me.  Maybe The Old County Inn pizza from Pine, AZ ruined the Bianca experience.  Both pizzas are made in a wood fire oven but Bianca lacked flavor.  The crust was good but other than that there really wasn't anything that made it any better than a chain like \"wood fire pizza\" such as Blazed.  For a one size pizza, the most basic one starts at $14.  It's a personal sized pizza...  really?  $14?!?!  I didn't think it was worth it at all.

The service is spotty in that I've had fantastic service here and very rude service. The restaurant itself is not very comfortable with hard wood chairs. However, you come for the pizza which is the best in Phoenix and probably the US.",

Decided to stop in to their Camelback location for an early lunch (you know it takes a couple days to move from that Eastern time zone!).  They open at 11a so we were all over it.   Great pizza with a side of tomato sauce (just in case) and a couple glasses of wine.  Outdoor patio was just the right mix of shade and sun and our server was super attentive.  When we are in town we will definitely be back!!",

Went this evening for takeout and got a couple of pizzas and the special pasta of the night (a bucatini with tomatoes and onions.). Got back to my hotel and tried the food. Pizza was its normal excellent level.   The pasta however was extremely bland.  All the other flavors were well balanced but there was no salt in the dish.  After raiding my hotel room and finding some, it was excellent.   I have no problem paying $22 for pasta if its delish.  However an omission of something as basic as salt from a dish like this - chef please check your line!!",

Call #2 was a followup because we had not heard anything after more than 24 hours.  We provided our information and were assured we would hear back.  Over 72 hours later and still no call back which lead to call #3 to re-confirm the info.

And because we came on a Sunday, we got to have the Sunday Gravy.  This is a meat sauce made with the trimmings of sausage, brisket, meat.  It's a deep, dark tomato sauce, slow cooked, and just rich as all hell.  Over some fresh pasta.  Just an excellent pasta dish that we shared among all four of us.  Service was impeccable.  The environment was like a campagna according to the wife.    Wish I could give this place 6 stars.  Maybe I'll dock a star off of all of my other ratings.",

    "text": "So we were looking forward to coming here for dinner because it is the same owner as the Pizzeria Bianco downtown Phoenix (which I love). When you first walk up, you immediately feel the same type of intimate and cozy NY style eatery. The decor is not overbearing and classically simplistic. Its not large and there is not a ton of seating inside, with also a few tables outside on their patio. we did not have to wait which was a bit of a surprise but in a good way. We were seated just off of the middle of the room and greeted fairly quickly by our waiter.  After a few minutes of thought, we decided upon a bottle of wine per the waiter's recommendations. However, to my surprise (being a fellow wine connoisseur) when I tasted it, it had not a single notation of how he described it to be. It was not slightly acidic, there was no dark fruit notes, nor the structure we were looking for. However, I hate being 'that person' who causes issues when dining out. So naturally, we drank it. C'est la vie.  Next, we ordered an appetizer. It was hot figs filled with Manchego cheese paired with fresh arugula and sliced prosciutto. OMG, it was fantastic! Just the aromatics alone made you feel like you were temporarily transported to soe small Venetian town. As for our entrees, the same canot be said. I was again, persuaded into ordering the gnocchi that our server swore by and the other dish was their beef bracole. To my shock, my dish was luke warm at best, the gnocchi were tiny, and the entire dish was just greasy. The beef was 'OK' but had some interestingly enough more Latin flavors than Italian. Hmmmm.....  I did however want to give them one last chance so for dessert I ordered the dark chocolate flour-less cake... it was good, not great, but no real complaints there. Needless to say, the experience was only saved by the company I kept and that amazing fig appetizer. The value of this place is not great by any means... to spend what we did on disappointing food and service... tsk tsk... I really hope that our server tries to eventually learn more about flavor profiles and actually know what he is talking about instead of just saying random things that do not make sense.  I just try to call it like I see it... it was all in all a grand disappointment that did not live up to the almost Utopian culinary skills of the pizzeria downtown.",

    "text": "Chris Bianco opened this restaurant after the success of his downtown pizzeria. The menu here is expanded, and reservations are accepted.  I arrived @ 7:00 with two companions and was seated immediately. The waiter was friendly, and had a good knowledge of the food and how it was prepared. We decided to order several entree's and share them so that everyone could taste.  We ordered the Papparadelle with Bolognese Sauce, Beef Braciole or Involtini if you are in Italy, and a Pizza Margherita.  The Papparadelle came with fluted edges, cooked reasonably al dente, with an excellent Bolognese sauce loaded with chunks of meat. I found it to be on par with any I have ever eaten, though on a personal note I prefer the pasta to be more rustic and hand cut or torn into uneven \"rags\".  My companions did not care for the Beef Braciole as much as I did, but allowing for different tastes as well as living in vastly different locations, I can accept that.  I found the meat to be beautifully cooked, nicely presented on a bed of cooked cauliflower, and served with some properly roasted onions.  Many people who make this dish tend to overpower it with lots of cheese and bread crumbs wrapped up in the beef.Unlike many variations on this recipe, this one was not overly salted or spiced, which I personally appreciated, as the flavor of the range fed beef came out nicely.  Many reviewers have said that the pizza is the best in the United States. I would differ with that opinion. Certainly, the pizza is very good, but I've eaten many a pizza that I felt was as good. The crust has a good flavor, is nicely thin with a nice edge, but the one we were served had an undercooked center that flopped down when picked up. The cheese is handmade on the premises, and is a real treat, melting into a lacy puddle swimming in a pool of an excellent sauce.   My biggest criticism was with the basil. This pizza is supposed to represent the Italian flag - 3 colors - red (sauce), white (cheese) and green (basil). The pizza was cut into 6 pieces and 5 leaves of basil were put on it. One person would not get a real piece of pizza margherita. Worse still, to me is that you only get a leaf of basil. Which bite do you eat it with? In my mind, the best pizza margherita I have ever eaten had a chiffonade of basil sprinkled all over it, so that you got some basil with each bite. My understanding is that that is how the pizza was supposed to be made originally. You wouldn't serve the queen one leaf of basil, now would you?  I must make mention of the bread that came with the meal. I don't know if it is made on the premises or not, but it was wonderfully crusty, with a chewy interior and a superior texture. It was served with a little extra virgin olive oil, and was really excellent.  Overall, the premises were clean, though a little noisy at times. I'm hoping that Chris will put a whole lot more basil on his pizza's, as that is a basic part of the flavor of it.  4 stars for excellent service, good food, and general cleanliness.",

They're all good in their own ways, and the margherita pizza I had here was right up there with the very best. I love love loved the crust texture, the sauce and the just-right amount of cheese. I could weep, it was so delish. Doesn't go with pizza, but we had margaritas with the margherita and they hit the spot after a long day on the road. Our server couldn't have been more helpful. The bartender even came over, after seeing we needed more napkins, and without being asked, dropped some off. It's located in what looked like an upscale mall with an exterior entrance. I didn't see much after we found their location as I had a one-track mind--get that pizza in my face.",

    "text": "Let's start with the pizza, since it is a pizzeria. I had the opportunity to taste several of them from the classic margherita pizza to the wiseguy topped with smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage. I do have to say it was good. The dough is made fresh with fresh ingredients and everything is handcrafted. But what makes the pizza is the wood fire oven which gives it a delicious light charred taste. The appetizers were also very good but the portions are small like the Spiedini but still delicious. Finally we did have dessert and we ordered the lemon curd this was a bit sour for my taste and I would difinintly order something different next time. The service was great and everyone seems to be on point when it comes to knowing the business. Overall great food pleasant atmosphere with inspiring decor. Come check it out when in the area.",

Before we even sat down we were told by the rude manager/host that no outside dessert was aloud but they would make a one time exception for us.  He came across as if he was doing us a big favorite.  He didn't even bother to say \"Happy Birthday\" or did he care that we were his first time customers that will not be returning.  NO PIZZA IS WORTH IT!!!  The food was good but it was not the best meal we have ever had.  The market pasta was $21.00 but nothing to rave about or worth that price.  There are plenty of good restaurants with great service in Phoenix that we could have gone to.  For example:  Federal, Parlor and LGO.",

Two friends and I visited on a week night (I believe it was a Tuesday) and we were seated quickly on the outside patio and brought menus. Very simple menu which is a plus. Between the three of us we ordered a pizza and some pasta and a few drinks. We found it to be a little pricey and over rated but all in all we happy with the food.   The place was not very crowded this night either - the patio tables seemed to be occupied and the inside had a handful of table occupied as well. Not too slow, not too busy.   Service seemed to be good until we neared the end of our meal. Our plates were cleared away once we had finished the food (as expected) and our check was dropped off at the table. We were still drinking our drinks while enjoying conversation, paid our bill, then just a few short moments later our glasses and drinks were all removed from the table without our request. The server straight up cleared our entire table without saying a single word to us. It was a moment where we were not only confused as to why she was doing this but also very irritated. It not only made us feel very uncomfortable but unwelcome. We immediately regretted the huge tip that we left.   We would have understood if the place was at capacity, there was a wait to be seated and they needed the table but that was not the case at all.  We clearly got the vibe she was sending (and it wasn't a good one), picked up our stuff and left. My husband (someone who has been working in restaurant management for the last 15+ years) was very uneasy about what had just happened and as we were walking out to leave he turned back around and asked to speak with a manager. He explained the situation to the \"manager\" there but it was evident he didn't seem to really care as he didn't try one bit to remedy the situation or change our minds on their establishment. Worst choice he could have made right there.  I've never ever encountered such rude service in my life and this is coming from someone who eats out at restaurants quite frequently.   Needless to say we were all very very disappointed. I'd never visit this place again or recommend it due to their lack of respect and service alone.",

Well, I've been coming to Phoenix a lot recently for work and imagine my delight when I walked by this place a couple of blocks from my office and hotel. CUE JAZZ HANDS. This place is magical. First time, I sat outside on their adorable patio and was served a cute little bowl of tangy olives before my pizza arrived. Second time, I sat at the bar and was served some incredible fresh bread and olive oil before my pie. The more carbs, the merrier. They still have five pizzas each day (spelled out in alphabet magnets on the wall in front of the pizza oven) plus one special, though it's hard for me to stray from my favorite of all pizzas, the humble margherita ($14). I've eaten it plain and also once added the wood fired mushrooms (+$3). Both excellent. I didn't leave a speck on my plate either visit. Delicious charred crust, but not TOO charred. Enough fresh mozzarella to make the middle a hair soggy and plenty of basil leaves. I've had very friendly servers who made just enough casual conversation for a solo diner not to feel awkward. Excellent wine, beer and cocktail list. This was such a treat for me to finally visit and I will be back!",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco review for the 4743 N 20th St location in Phoenix, AZ.  My girlfriend and I have been living in Phoenix for roughly 3 weeks now. As a massive pizza fan, I've been using the website to check out the most acclaimed places the city has to offer. This location, although mildly rated worse than its sister location, seemed like a great place to check out after having the fantastically fresh-made pizza from \"The Parlor\".  Needless to say, I was beyond disappointed.   We both ordered the Margherita, which is essentially a cheese pizza with basil leaves. We waited roughly 20 minutes for the food, during which we were given 2 rounds of their fresh made bread and olive oil for free, which was probably the highlight of the visit.  Taste-wise, it's fresh brick oven pizza. Good, but not great by any means. The crust tastes fine, but mine was slightly burnt on one slice, while my girlfriends looked pretty black all the way around like it'd spent extra time in the oven. The amount of ingredients was acceptable, but sparse in my opinion. 5 large basil leaves scattered around the 12'' pie. Cheese and sauce were pretty good, but what else would you expect from fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce?  The kicker is that this meal was $16 dollars per pizza! Absolutely absurd in my opinion for what they give you. Our meal came out to roughly $35 dollars with no drinks purchased.  Can't speak for the rest of the menu, but the pizza isn't worth the price here.",

But I gotta say....I really enjoyed that pizza.  I ordered a half Rosa half Margherita (sp?) pizza.  I read on Phoenix New Times that the Rosa was one of the 50 dishes in Metro Phoenix I \"had to try\".  It didn't sound too appetizing to me, so I only ordered half of it.  But after tasting it, I wish I had just ordered the whole Rosa.  The other half was good too.  I love the tomato sauce they use, but the Rosa was out of this world tasty.  You have to try it once just to at least say you tried it.  It was a very flavorful experience.",

    "text": "The travel gods were really smiling on me today!  First, I dodged the bullet on having to sit next to the world's most annoying preschooler on the plane.  Next, I scored a double upgrade at the car rental place and am driving a little 3-series for the next few days.  Finally, I was referred to this place by a couple of Phoenix Yelpers who were kind enough to respond to my request on the local talk page.  I started with a beautifully fresh salad of locally-grown greens with a delicate dressing.  The star of the show had to be the three olives I found under the greens.  Each one was a slightly different color and flavor.  All were delicious and they were so tender!  Apparently they are from a distributor in California the chef selected based on the quality of their products.  In my humble opinion it was a great choice.  The salad was bg enough to split so I just ate half to save room for the pizza.   Bread service with a really impressive olive oil that also comes from the same distributor in California.  None of that wimpy light-colored olive oil here.  This place is bringing out a richly green olive oil with a fragrance and taste similar to what is found in Europe.  I controlled my bread-loving impulses and limited myself to just one piece to ensure I had plenty of room for the pizza.   Next up... the main event!  The pizza arrived with a sage word of advice: let it sit for 1 minute before digging in.  Based on my view of this pie, that minute probably ranks among the top ten hardest minutes of my life.  I so wanted to dig right in but I hate biting into a pizza too soon and burning the skin off the roof of my mouth.  After feasting, I grilled my server to be sure I really understood the experience.  He has been with the owner for 18 years and is a partner in the restaurant so he nailed every answer to my questions with a phenomenal amount of detail and enthusiasm!  Here are the highlights:  - Sea salt in the dough is responsible for the slight saltiness of their crust.  It is crunchy and chewy at the same time.  Slightly bubbly around the edges and very thin in the middle.  - The wiseguy does not include sauce (olive oil instead - odd in a pizza with sausage and caramelized onions on top of it) but they use a variety of their house-made mozzarella that they smoke in their oven.  If you find yourself inhaling slightly before taking a bite you will pick up the smokiness immediately.  Pretty amazing!   - The sausage is locally produced using a recipe the chef/owner devised.   Lots of fennel here... always a good omen for an Italian sausage being served to a native Chicagoan. They split them,  dress with a little olive oil and then into the oven they go.  After they cool,  they are sliced and used to top the pizza such that they go through the oven a second time and pick up a slight crispness around the edges.  The result is sausage like you rarely find on pizza and pure perfection if you can open your mind to other than bulk sausage appearing on top of your pie...not that I have anything against bulk sausage.   - The Margarita pizza involved a finely-blended fresh tomato sauce that goes on raw and cooks in their 800-degree oven.   - The basil comes from a local farmer who let's it grow until it resembles a bush before harvesting,  thus producing leaves that looked to be about twice the size of the basil I grow at home.  They were very generous with those large leaves and that just served to make the pie that much better.  I was really impressed, Phoenix.  This place would be in the rotation if I lived here.  I'm also glad that I tried their expansion joint instead of the original place because I received far more patience with my questions than I'm sure I would have received at the downtown location.  Sadly, the flourless chocolate cake eluded me - I was just too damn full and happy to eat another bite.",

The restaurant is big and open with indoor and outdoor seating. It has a larger menu than the downtown location, but we were here for the pizza.  We had the Wiseguy and Rosa pizzas. The pizzas are rather large and have a great thin crust. Both of us agreed that the Rosa had a lot of flavor with the pistachios, cheese, and oil. The Wiseguy was rather bland, even with the sausage and smoked onions. The onions would be great on another pizza though. Both did not have a tomato sauce, but it was not missed. You can save the crusts to sop up all the olive oil remaining on the plate too.  This place deserves most of the hype, although I would not wait in a long line for it. The other location probably has more atmosphere, but this location is a great way to get the food without the fuss.",

Rolando and Adam took great care of us! We'll be back!",

    "text": "The best pizza in town! I am very pleased at every visit. I like to come here with a group of several people to be able to taste as many dishes as possible.  My favorite appetizer is Caprese salad. Their fresh mozzarella is really good, taste like homemade, mixed with very good olive oil makes it so perfect. Speaking of olive oil, I always like their olive. It reminds of me what my mother-in-law used to make at home.  They are so good, in fact, even those who don't normally eat olives liked their olives.  They are that good.  My favorite pizza is biancoverde. I like arugula, and eat them as salad often. Garlic paste they use matches arugula and cheese really well.  For desert, can't miss the flourless chocolate cake. 80% of dark chocolate gives you just right  amount of sweetness.  I also like their coffee. I haven't had a chance to ask about beans they use but I can tell they use really good coffee beans.  Service is always good, location is convenient (near 51 and Camelback), this is a must try at least once place.",

The food is always fresh, delicious and plentiful. The bartender was making excellent drinks. The cocktails were unique and refreshing. Sitting at the bar before everyone arrived and watching him mix his concoctions was impressive. The wait staff was phenomenal and ultra attentive; water glasses were never empty, drinks were never left unattended and the food flow was awesome. From appetizers to dessert and coffee everything was perfect. Typically it is just my wife and I or with another couple, but I highly recommend  hosting a large group anytime its available. Looking forward to our next visit!",

I'm going to say that it didn't quite live up to my expectations, though. I was half-expecting a religious experience after all the hype.

The pizza ought to be perfect for the prices Bianco charges.  $18.00 is what Bianco is charging for his Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas.  Am I paying for the pizza or am I helping to pay Bianco's rent?  Interestingly, at his other restaurant Pane Bianco, prices for the pizzas are $2.00 less.  The Sonny Boy, which has sopressata and olives is what I decided to order after passing on the Wise Guy.  Upon ordering, the waiter informed me that the Wise Guy does not have sauce on it and that I could order a Margherita and get the fennel sausage on it for an additional $5.00 surcharge.  As I was not going to spend $20.00 for a pizza, I declined.  Upon getting the pizza, it was very tasty but far from perfect.  While I like a crust that has some char on it, this crust seemed not only burnt but very dry.  Additionally, at lunch time, the menu is incredibly limited which is a turn off.    Despite these things, the atmosphere was pleasant and waitstaff was great.   At the end of the day however, I doubt I will be back because I know I can get excellent pizzas at several other places in the valley without paying Bianco's exorbitant prices.",

I have to admit though his hand pressed mozzarella, tomatoes and Italian sausage are high quality for AZ standards.

I have also heard they are adding pizza and Pannes to the menu! Woot, woot! Well, I guess I will keep trying Chris. I am determined to get a good pizza from you at least one time. We are not done with each other yet. lol!     Good luck on the new venture. I like the open kitchen and changing menu concept too. Four stars and a return trip guaranteed because you are better than most so called Italian places in sadly lacking Az.

The interior was cute, however you can tell that whoever chose the furniture didn't sit in each seat beforehand. We were at what could have been a cute little Italy type of table, but it was SO little that everyone's knees could not fit underneath it. Definitely more little kid than little Italy.    Another atmosphere downer was how HOT it was inside. Granted it was 116 degrees outside but the open kitchen layout wasn't helping Bianco's case - nor was the server who kept opening the patio door.   I will say the food was the best part of our experience, however it was mediocre Italian at best. The spaghetti...was spaghetti. I'd make it at home before coming back to order. The gnochhi was the best dish at the table and it was the corn that really made it. The cavatelli was decent (but I was glad I didn't order it) and our friend who ordered the pappardelle was apparently pleased because he ate it all.  If you're a Bianco fan, I'd say give it a go - maybe you'll get a better table, a less awkward server and food worth going back for; it just didn't happen on our visit.",

They give you a crostini appetizer/sample(?) with some kind of cheese on top.  It was super salty and not great... unsure what the point was..  They have Coke Light, I guess a naturally sweetened version of Diet Coke.  My friend ordered it and I was hemming and hawing and decided on the water.  He brought us 2 cokes anyway and charged for both.  I think part of the problem is there's no music, but the noise level is a bit high sometimes.  We had a hard time hearing half the things the waiter was saying and I'm sure it goes the other way as well.  So we tried the Cavatelli and the Gnocchi.  The cavatelli was not the best pasta, sausage pasta plate I've ever had.  The gnocchi got a bit old after a few bites.  Basically a bed of creamed corn, potato gnocchi and chunks of panchetta.  Not terrible, but gets old.  All in all, wouldn't go back.  The prices don't justify the lackluster pasta dishes.  They bring you 4 pieces of bread at a time (we had a table of 4 so we asked for like 2 refills).  The cheese plate is not very big, but tasty.  However, I thought they would bring us more bread for the cheese plate.. didn't happen, had to ask for it separately.  My friend's water glass didn't get filled all night, we tried moving it to the edge of the table too.  We had 4 different waiters and nobody can fill a water glass for over half the dinner?",

    "text": "The German philosopher Johann Goethe remarked, \"failure is not in falling down; failure is in not getting up again.\" Like a prize fighter, Chris Bianco's \"Italian Restaurant\" is getting up again after hitting the ropes. Word of mouth (and mediocre Yelp reviews) are a bitch to recover from, so I say let the reboot redemption begin -pronto.  Set back in a dark corner of the slightly schleppy \"Town and Country Mall\" (near Trader Joe's), Italian Restaurant is almost hard to find. Walking inside you find a place that does not scream out hipster or cool - but instead yawns with some old paintings that you might find at your cute old Nonna's villa in Naples - with a portrait of a Sophia Loren in her 60's eyeliner glory watching over the dark room. But the food should be the star, right?   If Pizzeria Bianco is Chris' shrine to the ultimate pie, then Italian Restaurant is his nod to the worship of wholesome and satisfying pastas - in the realm of the Nancy Silverton's consistently fantastic \"Mozza\" in Los Angeles - along with great salads and Apps.   Based on my supremely yummy dinner (especially the home made pastas) last week I would dare say that Italian Restaurant is now serving some of the most satisfying Italian food in Phoenix. As a matter of fact, this is the best Italian I have had since my old fave \"Ninetta's\" closed over 7 years ago (a hole in the wall at 7th Ave and Union Hills). I would strongly suggest you give this wonderful little Bianco gem a well deserved second chance at delighting your senses.  Let me first state clearly that fellow Yelpers and foodies seeking seeking over the top meals laced with just out of cooking school foamy ribbons and ideas straight from some Euro competition will be sorely disappointed. That was what the old (fired) chef Claudio Urciucoli tried with (what I have read on older Yelp reviews here) mixed results. The new chef Robbie Tutlewski is now in sync with the Bianco's vision - creating hearty meals that any Mamma would recognize in a prosecco.      Bianco is synonymous with simple and yet extremely well executed food that he trys to source locally whenever possible. This man and his gregarious (and much more outgoing) brother Marco are obsessed with growing their own arugula, their own San Marzano tomatoes (which Bianco and his partner in CA are now canning and selling to restauranteurs throughout the U.S.), and even now growing and milling their own wheat for the breads and pastas.   It seems that Bianco has realized that the sheer simplicity of creating traditional and tasty food staples better than anyone else - perfecting them to the highest possible level- with the freshest and tastiest local ingredients - is the secret to success.   Enough background - lets talk about the yummy meal. My wife and I joined another couple here and we ordered a variety of Antipasti: The Cheese Plate Mortada was a sampling of  cow, goat and sheep's milk cheeses - all delicious. The AZ Peach salad was a favorite at the table - local and very ripe cut peaches with fresh arugula and flecks of goat cheese with some candied pecans. This is a savory and sweet salad that is (as others have said) perfectly balanced and works like a dream. Yum!  The waiter (Adam I believe) also recommended the earthy grilled zucchini salad - which is complimented with fresh mint leaves, Montamore cheese (like a sharp cheddar) and topped with a sunny side up egg... which added just the right fatty texture and taste.   I think the pasta dishes are the strength at Italian Restaurant - easily some of the tastiest and best pasta in this town! Some people may not understand that the texture of fresh pasta is vastly different than the dried type that is most common - and from what I understand from Chris' brother Marco, the pastas here are made daily by a woman who's only job is to turn out these morsels of home made goodness. The wheat for these pastas is also fresh, and I believe Chris is now milling the flour too - who else would go to such lengths to bring us pasta that tastes like it was lovingly sourced  from the Italian countryside?   The \"Cavatelli\" is a big \"O\" in terms of flavors - pastas shaped almost like baby hot dog buns - slightly dense and al dente to the bite - served with bits of local Shreiner's sausage, roasted cauliflower and spring onions served up in what I'm guessing was a reduction of stock and a little cream - wow. Fantastic! The potato Gnocchi was pillowy and perfect, complimented by sweet corn and flecks of salty Pancetta.   The desserts we tried were all superb: A fresh peach crostata (like a tart) was buttery and amazing, and the Italian ices (all fresh) are extremely flavorful - the dense chocolate being my favorite. The flourless chocolate cake was excellent but also a little basic as that is standard fare at many restaurants.   Any Yelp reviews prior to May 1st reflect the old chef - come back and try Italian Restaurant soon while it is still easy to be seated. Cue Rocky theme music",

We asked for an extra scoop of dressing since what we got for the large salad for a 1 teaspoon of dressing. That included about ten pieces of lettuce and four shavings of vegetables. I am not sure what the fuss is about this place Nellos beats this anytime. Was so excited to go there too There was a guy wandering around asking the tables if everything was good but never approached us at all  not sure something to do with being the only ethnic people there. The waitress never came to ask us if we needed anything but did make sure to ask us to leave cos a big party had reserved the table. However NO ONE was waiting outside at all to get in. Thanks!!!",

    "text": "Look, it would be unfair to compare this location to the original, but the food I confidently say is comparable. Nothing about the homemade mozzarella and local tomato and basil 'caprese' salad was to fault. Follow that up with the Sonny and Margherita pies...uh, yeah...the Town and Country location are another Bianco masterpiece! The service was rapid as always, and at times lacking attentiveness, however it's never a deal breaker for me.  Felt sorry for our server who had to handle the high maintenance customers who wanted to meet the chef, said their bottle of Merlot was \"corked\" (not kidding). However it was quite entertaining and made our visit even much more memorable.  This location, from a foodie perspective doesn't lack anything that the Heritage Square location brings. Don't let it scare you off.  Of course if I had to pick I would always go old school original, however blindfolded if the food is the same,does it really matter? Great job as always Mr. Bianco...wine snobs and all.",

I told the waiter I had a food allergy to certain oil's and they assured me my salad's dressing only had olive oil in it.  Well I had a reaction so I'm sure it did contain additional oils besides olive oil.   The pizza was pretty good but for $15 we expected something a little more substantial. We were overcharged for salads on our bill.  The menu said the house green salads were $6 and we were charged $8 each.  The waitress apologized and said that we were accidently charged for dinner salads instead of lunch salads.",

It took over an hour to be seated (estimated 25 by hostess) and an addition 30 to get food. We thought 'this place must be good\". Complimentary bread is served with plain olive oil - no flavor. We ordered the green salad, a side of mushrooms and two pizzas. The salad and pizzas were nothing special, not bad but not good. We had to stop someone to get the mushrooms we ordered as they were not brought, obviously forgotten. The guy who brought them apologized and did not charge them to us but they were dry and didn't have flavor. The worse part was our server. She never checked on us, wasn't apologetic about forgetting our mushrooms and we had to flag her down to get the check. Do not recommend!",

    "text": "I laugh at these weak reviews. You clearly don't know about True  Napolitano style pizza, or are not seeing or tasting the details and nuances that go into this pie. The doe is perfect with a little bit a stretch to it, the toppings are just right, not too much sauce, not too much cheese. The margherita pizza is the best in the state. Even next to Pomo this is hands down the best. Basil is fresh sauce is boss and the mozz is different but its rich as done right. The Rosa is amazing. Pistachios, rosemary, red onions, and Parmesan reggiano. Service is usually great, and the food is usually consistent. They always take care of us. Chris bianco knows what he's doing. Panne Bianco and the downtown location also do a fantastic job. If you want american pizza go somewhere else, this is gourmet connoisseur pie. And I've been to New York, ate pizza in every borough and grew up with Italians on the east coast, so take my word for it.",

The appetizer of fresh mozzarella and tomatoes was great but it went downhill from there. Not only did the waiter seem annoyed and uninterested but half of our order came out wrong. When we informed the staff that one of our pizzas was supposed to have mushrooms, they just brought out a side of mushrooms instead of remaking the pizza. Very strange to me. Overall, I think we were all glad we tried it but mostly because now we know we aren't missing much.",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco is widely acknowledged as some of the best Pizza (or The Best to some reivewers) in the nation. Not sure what I can add except to say it was terrific!  The Princess and I went to his second location in the Town and Country shopping center (Biltmore area) and walked right in at 5 PM.  The location is wonderful, setting is nice looking out onto the courtyard and it appears there are tables you can use if the weather is not 110 as it was during our visit.  We ordered a nice Italian red wine for The P and I had a negroni, both were fantastic.  The meal started with a small complimentary bowl of five small kalmata olives and  a few slices of their in-house bread with a bowl of olive oil, nice touch.  I ordered their famous wise guy and The P ordered the sonny boy. The wise guy is white sauced based with wonderful fennel sausage from Shrieners (local meat co.) fennel, roasted onions. Wood fired, the Pizza was excellent.  However, I actually enjoyed the sonny boy more.  It was red sauce based with soppresseta and it was, IMHO, one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  We finished the meal with flourless chocolate cake, very good with a vanilla sauce.  Service was delightful, server was attentive without being in our face.  Loved the small touches such as real silverware (Oneida).  Attention to detail has made Mr. Bianco a success and I'm humbled to be able to join the chorus of people who sing his and his restaurants praises!  Slainte!",

The olive oil was tasty but I'm assuming the guys in the back had nothing to do with that. Mind you it was 5pm on a Wednesday. When our server did bring drinks I mentioned this was our first time and we looked forward to some authentic pasta. He stared into my eyes, awkwardly, and said, \"Yep, were kind of the real deal\". I knew then we were in for it. The pizza was fine but the pappardelle with bolognese was umm.. Not amazing. It wasn't the pasta itself rather the sauce that turned me off. Bland, slightly tomatoey and vaguely creamy with a smattering of coarsely ground meat. Just not what I know Bolognese to be. In my world it's deep red and heavy on pancetta, ground veal or pork and beef with just enough tomato to make everything come together. They missed the target. Sorry guys. If you want a decent pizza give it a shot or just find a Grimaldi's, La Bocca or Isa's. Have I been harsh? Maybe, but I'm tired of these trendy spots telling me what the \"Real Deal\" is. Thanks but no thanks. Next time I want good pasta I'm staying home.",

Not only was the food nasty the service was horrible, and the manager, Tyler should be ashamed of himself. Whoever hired Tyler needs a camera in his restaurant to see his demeanor towards guests. A group of 25 of us made dinner reservations here to celebrate our friend's birthday. I ordered the mozzarella as an appetizer and the chicken ranch as my entree. The mozzarella (home made) was nothing special. The chicken was battered and deep fried-but actually burned.  I couldn't eat it so i asked for a side of marinara-hoping it would taste better. Wow the marinara was the most disgusting sauce I had ever had.  Canned tomato sauce tastes better.   By the way they charge you $3 for that crap. Everyone hated their food.  Furthermore, they wouldn't split the check more than 6 ways. They wouldn't allow us to bring our cake out. The manager came out upon our request, we asked him where the nearest ATM was and he had the nerve to roll his eyes at us. He was so unbelievably rude. I was astonished. He refused to split the check further and was basically yelling at us.  He should be fired. I wish there was more I could do about this. He ruined our dinner. The service was also lacking. None of the food came out together at one time.  DON'T COME HERE. You get better pizza at Papa John's or Dominoes for a quarter of the price. I promise.  BEWARE",

I ate here a month ago and loved it and was so excited to come back tonight with friends for a belated birthday celebration. I am writing this from the parking lot -- that's how bad an experience it was.    The sausage pasta dish was nothing like the last time, when it was the hit of the night. . The texture was like paste. We sent it back and when the server returned with a new order she said: chef wants you to know we are experimenting with different wheats and it's all matter of personal taste and palates. In other words, if you don't like it you don't have good taste. We chewed through the toughness -again - because we were so hungry. The only good part was the sausage.   Service was a comedy of errors. We got our neighbors' appetizers, much to their dismay.    It's 114 today and was over 90 degrees in the restaurant. The hostess just said she \"thought\" the AC was out. The people next to us were fanning themselves with their menu. Other people moved tables to try to get cooler but the hostess told us we had one of the best spots in the house.     Our waitress made no attempt to apologize for any of this mess and dropped the check off with no comment or even the slightest bit of recognition -or discount /free meal - for the troubles. Not even an acknowledgement that this place was firing on NO cylinders tonight.  Absolutely stunning. It was like the whole place was in an alternate universe where everything was peachy keen tonight. There were some high Profile PHX area biz and foodie  diners there tonight whom I will not mention. We can only imagine what they thought, or maybe the kitchen was lavishing all of their attention on them.    I was embarrassed I suggested it for my birthday dinner with friends.",

The sonny boy pizza wasn't as good as it tasted more Greek than anything with the olives and couldn't taste the sauce. The spaghetti had great noodles but the meat sauce had an off taste so wasn't a fan. The greens salad was literally a pile of lettuce and nothing else! Atmosphere was very nice, but not sure I'll be back",

As soon as you step through the doors you're met with a homey and Victorian style dining room that whisks you into what feels like a relaxing Italian getaway. Each detail from the waiters in long aprons, mismatched wood furniture and water served from glass bottles contribute to the beautiful and thoughtful authentic-family-run feel - despite the location sandwiched behind a Trader Joe's and surrounds shops. Although we weren't able to indulge during our visit, the wine list offered a thorough selection and the food we did try was scrumptious - giving pizza the respect it deserves. Although nothing from the dessert menu particularly caught our eye, this seems like the perfect place to step in and stay for a while for a romantic lunch date or to savor some classy pizza and wine.",

    "text": "Definitely worth the hype! There's a reason Nancy Silverton (La Brea Bakery, Pizzeria Mozza) said she was speechless when she took a bite of Bianco's pizza  & called it a a life altering experience. It's that good. The reason we love Bianco's pizza sooo much is the crust. Bianco's Napolitana style crust has a more pronounced and developed flavor than most pizza crusts, like an artisan style bread. It's thin and wood fired so it's chewy in some spots, crisply charred in others. This is definitely not a crust anyone leaves behind. Our favorite pizzas are the Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, & az pistachios) & the Sonny Boy (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, & gaeta olives--we like to add fresh basil). We can never decide between them so we always get both when we visit. The antipasto is also a favorite and includes roasted veggies that you would not ordinarily see in an antipasto (think roasted sweet potatoes, beats and charred broccoli, yum!).   Quick tip-we like to visit this location. There is usually less of a wait & parking is a snap since it's in a shopping center.",

    "text": "There are those restaurants that when you walk in door you know you have found your place. Its not one thing, and its impossible to say what exactly gives you this feeling but when it hits you take note.   Such is the case for Pizzeria Bianco. Our love for this restaurant began a few years ago  with our first trip to Phoenix. Having just got off the plane and time to kill before check in, we stopped at the Trader Joe's nearby to grab some staples. Needing lunch and vaguely remembering reading about Chris Bianco (believe it or not, we were enamored with his canned crushed tomatoes before we even came across his restaurant) we decided to grab a bite.   For us that first meal was perfect and a harbinger of things to come. We were so taken by the place, the vibe, the food that we ate there 4 times in 6 days. No it wasn't OCD, nor did Phoenix lack other good restaurants for us to try, but rather this was our place.   Since then Bianco is a must stop anytime we are in Phoenix. The food is simply that good. This review covers our last two visits.   Simple Local Greens: As described. Super fresh mescalin mix. It lightly dressed and is a perfect started for the table.   Caprese: Its often described as mozzarella with seasonal preparation. Every time we order it, its either  a perfectly ripe yellow or red heirloom tomato with slices of the house made cheese. The mozzarella is creamy and has a firm texture to it. The tomatoes are that perfect combination of acidic and sweet which cuts the richness of the cheese. The basil leaves add layer to the affair and the supplied bread is a perfect companion. It is lightly dressed in olive oil.   Spiedini: Prosciutto? Check, Fontina cheese? Check, fired in the oven and served on a bed of arugula? CHECK CHECK CHECK. The salty crispy taste fo the prosciutto melds perfectly with the rich, gooey fontina.  Hell no I'm sharing. Its so rich that the arugula serves as the perfect palate cleanser between bites.   Special Salad: OMG this one was the best! Frisse and endive lettuce, gorgonzola, red onion, candied walnuts, and perfectly ripe peaches combined to make one of the best salads I have ever had. Everything played perfectly off of each other, and the peaches of all things tied it together. Perfectly dressed it was perfection in each bite. We ordered two.   Procciutto amd Melon: Honeydew and cantelope combined with crispy prosciutto strips were a interesting and oh so tasty take on this classic. The melon was again perfectly ripe and crunchy, and were a perfect pair for the salty, crispy prosciutto.   Parppardelle: Giant thick ribbons of pasta cooked perfectly served with a  classic bolognese sauce. The sauce had a nice bite to it, was thick and hearty, and I suspect alot of Parmesan cheese went into it. The pasta had great mouthfeel to it. It was yet another perfect dish.   Artisinal Spaghetti: Again the perfect al dente pasta served with a classic Pomodoro sauce. The sauce at most had 3-4 ingredients in it but it was perfect. Just the right balance of acid and sweet. it was something special.   The PIZZA! Lets face it you don't win a Beard award on your salad. The key IMHO to the pizza here is the elegant simplicity of them. You couple that with premium ingredients and you have something special.   Sonny Boy: Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta olives. Each applied in the right proportions. The crust is crisp but doughy if that makes sense. Its perfect. The brininess of the olives plays off the richness  of the cheese and the salami. The sauce as any good sauce does binds it all together.   The Wiseguy: For me this one was nirvana. Take the perfect crust, add to it wood fired caramelized onion, lets go ahead and smoke the mozzarella, and throw in a house made sausage and you have the best pizza I have ever tasted. It is hard to describe how good this pizza really is. The sausage had a nice fennel taste to it and the smokiness of the rich mozzarella was simply fantastic. Combined with the crust...... Holy Pavlovian reaction I'm drooling a bit   The Margherita: This humble pie, is usually what we order when trying out a new place. Why? Is super basic, very clean, and its impossible to hide bad ingredients. Its a nice benchmark since its pretty much universal. Bianco hits this one out of the park. The crust is as above, and the sauce, basil and mozzarella are perfect.  Rosa: Our wild card pizza. Pistachios on a pizza? What??? But it worked. Its a pretty basic pie as well with clean flavors. The pistachios provide a nice crunch and the Parmesan plays off of them.    We generally sit in the front part and from there you get to watch them make the pizzas. Decent draft beer selection as well. Service is super friendly and on point every time we went.    The Scottsdale location is the one that has an expanded menu and quite frankly we ate our way through most of it and it was all good.",

That's as far as the good part ends. Our server never came out to help. In fact the hostess had to circle back minutes later and took our order. Still, no server or waiter came to check on us.  I knew something was wrong when parties seated (nearby) well after us received their orders before we even had our salad make it out.  Because our server/waiter was missing this entire time, I flagged down someone to check the pizza. I was told it was five minutes away... 15 minutes later (and still no pizza), I asked to speak with someone about this. Nobody from management offered to talk to me. I had enough. I left cash for the salad and left.  Never again for this place which is a shame because it did come highly recommended.",

We were going to order an appetizer from the bar while we waited for our friends because they wouldn't seat us until the entire party had arrived. But they didn't have any appetizers without meat and the bartender turned his back when he saw we weren't ready to order, and had no desire to help us find something edible. We were seated quickly in the super-dark dining room, which was less well lit than my bathroom nightlight. Our server was was fairly attentive but aloof.   The pizzas are good and mostly vegetarian, although not vegan. We ordered the squash pizza from the monthly specials menu, and it was tasty. The crust is pretty good but not the best we've had. The cheese is high quality and delicious. We also tried the spaghetti and lasagna, again very nice. But for $14-22 per plate, you expect fine cuisine, not just \"nice.\"  We finished with coffee and tres leches cake, which was the best part of the meal. The cake was amazing and the americano as well. The cappuccino was just okay.   The bill was about $30 per person. We probably won't be back.",

I understand we went in 45 min before closing but no excuse for that type of costumer service, the food was great and the beverage was good but would have been nice to actually enjoy our dinner with out feeling rushed out.",

    "text": "As an out of towner, (from New York) I think I know good pizza.  I also JUST returned from Italy, so again, good Pizza all around. I believe it fair that I give Pizzeria Bianco 4.5 stars for being so authentically good (but you can't give halves!!) so it's 4. So I'll explain.   This location - while in a shopping center surrounded by typical big box and chain stores - is a bit of a departure with its shabby chic-ish decor. Fun, but not very pizza-ish. An interesting twist that works well.  It makes you feel comfortable.  The staff was lovely - casual and hip, low key yet highly competent.  And mostly, quite friendly and very accomodating. Service overall was quite good.  The menu is simply and pizza centric of course, but there are other entries. We started with the spedini appetizer - fontina cheese wrapped in proscuitto and lightly grilled - excellent and salty. Then our pizzas and sides came including the Sonny Boy pizza (a white pizza) and the Margarita pizza with prosciutto added. They are rustic Italian crush style pizzas not overly done with ingredients or sauces.  Think more authentically Italian.  All three different pies we ordered were all excellent! We complimented the meal with nice by-the-glass red and rose wines.  And finished with cappuccinos and the tres leche cake that was just plain delicious.    The pacing of dinner was a nice tempo, we weren't being pushed at all by the staff, nor being ignored. The food was really good, fresh, authentic and delicious. Overall a very nice vibe to the place. So with an interesting decor, terrific service and delicious food, it was a total winner in my book.  Enjoy!",

I came at 6 pm and there was no wait for a table of 4.  However, they don't seat incomplete parties and I had to wait for my dining companions.  When everyone finally arrived, the wait was about 20 minutes, but not terrible.  The inside of the restaurant is very eclectic.  Parts of it look like a grandma's living room, while other parts have modern light fixtures.  However, somehow it all works together.  I like the little tealight candles on each candle, makes the place feel very intimate and cozy.  My friend and I shared the mixed greens salad and the Sonny Boy pizza.  I really liked the salad!  It was just plain greens with a light dressing and a few olives.  Simple and delicious and healthy.  The Sonny Boy pizza came with a meat, mozzarella and olives.  It was good, but next time I think I would add some basil, as I felt like it needed a little something \"sharp\" in there to add some depth of flavor.  Overall, this place lived up to my expectations and I will definitely return!",

We made a reservation for a Saturday evening without trouble and were seated at our table promptly. Our server approached quickly but with an attitude. We asked if they did anything special for birthdays and his response was \"order any dessert and I can stick a candle in it\". Our food came out in a timely manner and tasted great; overall we enjoyed the meal. Once we were done, it took close to 20 minutes for our server to bring our check without splitting it like we'd asked. He came back after we asked him again to split the checks and basically threw them on the table. I almost asked him if we'd done something wrong to upset him. Maybe he was just having a bad day!? Regardless, he didn't need to take it out on us! So, more stars for the food, but less for the service.",

It seemed like the same place with very similar if not the same items on the menu and a nice fancy but down-to-Earth vibe.   We came in on a stop at the plaza to shop a bit and were kinda excited to see it here!   Pizza at 2 in the afternoon? Why the heck not! So we sat down in the courtyard to enjoy some delightful spring weather and a yummy sausage pizza. We received our warm olives and drinks and just hung out until our food arrived. The edges were very burnt but we just ate around it, wood fire oven, it happens. I do wish that the toppings were cut up a bit more, the sausage was so big that it was kind of awkward to split up the pieces so all had some.   For the price I feel like it wasn't really very flavorful and the crust was a bit too black for my liking. I would much rather spend my money at The Parlor across the street on Camelback.",

One of them I visited, I love the atmosphere of restaurant and it's friendly staff. However, I was not impressed with a greeter (person who allocates a table for you). If you like thin crust and wood-fired pizzas, perhaps, this is one of \"THE\" places in the states. One of their signature pizzas is \"Rosa\" which has Pistachios (unusual but great!).   * Service: Average (you might experience slow service during busy time) * Price: reasonable - Even though this is a famous place and has long wait time during busy hours and weekends, they offer reasonable price for their menu * Atmosphere: Average (dark and noise and some people may or may not like) * Food Quality: For the price and service, it is good and delicious! * Parking: The location that I visited has plenty of parking lot but the original location has limited parking lot (both of them are free of charge) * Recommendation: Of course, their pizzas",

Upon entering the restaurant, at noonish on a Sunday, we were surprised to see it half empty.  I was also surprised to be cheerfully greeted by Chef Chris himself!  For how slow the restaurant was, our table service was also slow.  We did get some yummy olives to eat while we waited, nice touch.  Our favorite pizzas were the sausage and the red onion/pistachio (I forget the names).  I would actually skip the famous margarita, I didn't think the flavor of the cheese or the sauce really shined through.  I think if I went back I would try one of their pasta dishes.

Now that this location exists and I don't have to venture to downtown PHX to eat there, we decided a visit was in order.  I was skeptical about PB's amazingness before eating here, so my expectations really weren't that high.    We ordered the Wiseguy pizza and added mushrooms. The real star of the pie was the mushroom and also the fennel sausage.  It comes in slices instead of chunks on the pizza.  The wiseguy is a \"white pizza\" which normally doesn't thrill me, but I actually didn't miss the tomato sauce.  Would I go out of my   for PB pizza?  Nope.  It was good, but nothing so special that I would absolutely have to have it again.    The service at this location was good.  Our iced tea was constantly being filled and the server left us alone when we were deep in conversation.   The main reason that I just can't give PB another star is the sheer lack of variety on the menu.  We went to lunch, where there were 3 options for salads and two of the options really weren't salads at all.  There are only a few pasta options and a few pizza options.  My hubby wasn't all that thrilled with what he had to choose from.  Yelp doesn't believe in half stars, but if they did, I'd give PB 3.5 stars.  (sorry, I don't usually round up).",

That was the guys fault for not putting us down. I don't know if he did it on purpose but how do you not put my name/number down if you asked for it?? So anyway it wasn't on the paper but that wasn't the girls fault. She told us okay we'll get the table ready let us know when your entire party is here (we were missing one). When our party was complete, we went back inside to let her know we were all there. She VERY RUDELY in a super condescending way looked at her watch and told us it's not 7:45 come back at 7:45 (it was 7:41). Okay, so we'll wait 4 minutes. We did then came back in. When we came back in at 7:45 she huffed and puffed and very rudely said she'll come outside to get us. OKAY MAKE UP YOUR MIND! Tell us first don't keep telling us to come in, wait outside, GET YOUR STORY STRAIGHT. Not only that, she was extremely passive-aggressive RUDE!! Honestly I've never been treated that way. We spoke with the manager who seemed nice but really we won't be ever coming back. This girl has such an attitude problem. If you don't like your job just quit. Don't make it such a bad experience for the rest of us. Food is not good enough to get treated so poorly. Fix your attitude and just learn not to lose your patients with customers!",

That extra something to make the place memorable was missing though.    The GF and I were luckily able to get seated right away on Friday night by pretending to be senior citizens and eating pretty early.  I had read many reviews complaining that the portions were very small, so I suggested we get an appetizer to start.  We decided on the cheese plate, which ended up being the highlight of the night.  Goat, milk, and a dry/parmasean-esque varietals made the trio that featured a honey, mustard, grilled-onion topping bar in the center of the plate.  We would definitely go back for the cheese plate and apps and wine alone.  For entrees she ordered the spaghetti with the homemade sauce, and I had the chicken caccitorre.  We were both surprised by how large the portion sizes were, so maybe they have made adjustments to that because we both went home with leftovers.  Both entrees were very tasty, mine was fall off the bone tender and moist - cooked to perfection.  The french toast stick looking polenta side was fantastic.  It had a crisp outside with a cornmeal like texture, unique, and delicious.  The food was solid, but then again it should have been given the price ($14-20+) entrees, however it never delivered that, \"I must come back and have that again.\"    Service was excellent, highly attentive, polite, laid back, and relaxing.  Italian Restaurant made for a nice evening, but at $80 for the two of us, it won't be an evening we have too often.",

Pizzas are perfect, and pastas are surprisingly great & fresh (if you can resist ordering a pizza). Menu is often changing and new additions and recommendations are usually worth taking. Have not yet been to the original downtown location, am intimidated by no reservations and what I expect to be long lines for a reputable place. The \"Town & Country\" location is fashionable shabby chic, not intimidating. Parking is kind of a cluster. Look forward to coming here again on the next possible date night.",

I had a shaved fennel salad, butternut squash ravioli and lemon cake as well as a bottle of wine.  We waited an hour to be seated, but I didn't mind. We sat at a table outside near a heater and drank some wine. We could have been seated earlier, but we wanted a private table instead of a seat at the communal table.   I was a bit disappointed that they charged for bread and oil/vinegar for dipping. I think  this should be provided at every Italian restaurant for free, especially considering the prices and small portions for the rest of the food.  The server was very nice and gave great recommendations regarding the food. When the bill came, we told her that the bottle of wine was missing on the bill, and she didn't even say thanks for letting her know, which I thought was strange, since it was an extra $40.   All in all, this place was ok, but I probably won't go back.",

We were headed to Cibo downtown, but decided to give Bianco a shot since it was closer, and being a Tuesday, I figured there wouldn't be a long wait. Well, we were promptly greeted and sat, which was nice. Our service was average, nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about either. The food on the other hand, was awful. We split 2 pizzas, the sonny boy and the wiseguy, and we had the proscuitto wrapped fontina cheese. The pizzas were mediocre at best.  The pizzas were soggy in the center, and the toppings weren't anything crazy either. I will say the proscuitto wrapped cheese was pretty good. Not $10 good, but good.  Our total bill was $75 for 2 small pizzas an app, and 2 glasses of wine. Seemed a little steep for what it was.  At the end of the day, this wasn't the worst pizza I've ever had, but I would never wait for this pizza, or pay for it again. Try cibo or lgo instead, much better.",

I came here for my birthday and I have to say that this place is completely a bust; the staff were rude, and the service was horrible. You cannot reserve a table because they like to pack you in this tight little pizza restaurant  The bar is a joke; they don't really have any alcohol and the wines were the worst - I tried the Riesling and it tasted cheap and bitter. This place is also very pretentious. I understand that it's more of a traditional world style pizza but everything has to be difficult; they can't just make you a good pizza  -Everything has to be fussed with like some overly pretentious chef-  Before I had a chance to even talk or ask any questions about the menu our server went ahead and decided to give me a full lesson on their ingredients. I guess the staff feel that it's a privilege for the people to come to them and dine in their restaurant. You will not find pepperoni on the menu instead they give you an alternative dry salami, soppresetta, and tout that it's from Shreiners. Shreiners also happens to make excellent pepperoni, so why didn't they just get the pepperoni from Shreiners instead of having to deal with tables of diners asking why they don't offer it? The vibe in this place also sucks !!!!it's filled with fake trendy hipster wannabes who post hundreds of douche bag pictures of themselves on Instagram  eating their shitty pizza. This place blows ........ Oh and to be clear my entire party of 7 people felt the same way--- this place sucks",

Smaller inside than what we expected but very nice, feels like an Italian cafe. Great service. You can see the kitchen and the big pizza oven from the dining room, we enjoyed that. The margherita pizza was delicious, not too much sauce and cheese so you can taste that delicious crisp crust, I would have liked more basil since I love basil. Hubby got the Wiseguy pizza, wished there was more fennel sausage it was so good. This pizza doesn't have sauce, so he asked for half with marinara and the other half original. They are very accommodating. We both liked it with the marinara. Onions on this pizza are roasted and cut in thick rounds, if you love onions you'll like this, we didn't care for that. We also asked for olives from the extras menu, we thought it would go on the pizza but they brought it out as an appetizer which we loved! A little expensive for us for lunch, but very good and we'll be back.",

The pizza place we love in south central phoenix is closed on Sundays, so this seemed like it would be a great choice. Wrong. What an embarrassing choice I made.The table we were seated at was the round table just behind the hostess podium area, so we were surrounded by constant traffic of people bringing food by us, coming and going. The hostess kicked my chair accidentally and apologized. A waiter walked closely enough behind me to knock my head to the side, also apologizing. A heavier guest pushed me forward when trying to squeeze by me to get to their table. Needless to say, by the 3rd time I had enough. The table shouldn't be there- period.  From the get go, service was disorganized. We were asked for drink orders by 2 different people. Someone later brought the wrong drinks to our table. I don't even know who our waiter was because I don't think we were ever assigned one. The classy glass bottle of water they bring to each table is tap water. The selection is minimal. We ordered a Sonny Boy pizza and another one that was not memorable enough to recall the name. I'm sorry but this is not an $18 pizza.  For 2 pizzas (nothing else!) and non alcoholic drinks for 3 people including coffee after dinner, our bill was almost $70 without tip. If we paid for ambiance, we didn't get it. We will certainly not return. I don't understand the hype and regret making this a birthday choice. We will not return.",

In those days they served wine in regular glasses, the way they would in simple eateries in Italy, and I thought it added an air of authenticity to the restaurant. The pasta dish I had that time was good, although not outstanding, but it tasted fresh and uncomplicated. The flourless chocolate cake and cappuccino were a disappointment, but overall I thought it was worth visiting again. After all, it's right in my neighborhood, and the ambiance is very nice.  I made my second visit this evening. The first change I noticed was the wine was now served in wine glasses. Unfortunately, the elegant glass had taken all character out of the house wine, which tasted watery and flat. I was trying to decide between pasta with eggplant ragu and pasta bolognese. When i asked the waiter for advice, he recommended to go with bolognese, and so I did. Beef was the overwhelming ingredient in this dish, and it was very heavy and extremely salty. In fact, all I could taste was salt. I couldn't figure out what kind of pasta was used in the dish. I thought the menu said farfalle, but what I got on my plate were very wide and thick ribbons of pasta. When I finally managed to extract some from under the heavy beef sauce, it tasted very al dente, heavy... and tasteless. I went through about two-thirds of the dish - I was hungry - bur couldn't detect any taste other than salt.   And yes, I got the weird crostini at the start of my meal and was unimpressed to say the least. I had come in fully expecting a nice meal and left totally disappointed and still hungry. A place called Italian Restaurant that can't prepare a decent pasta? We are fortunate in this neighborhood to have many good restaurants within a few blocks, and Italian Restaurant just doesn't measure up, not to mention being too pricey for what it serves. So I'll continue walking by on my way to my yoga class, but I have no plans to ever stop in again.",

We were a party of 5 and were advised that we couldn't be seated until a majority of our party was there.  My daughter and I waited and when our 3rd person showed up we asked to be seated since a majority of our party was there.  The hostess told us that she needed at least one more person to arrive.  I explained that we were waiting for my elderly parents who are 81 and 89 to arrive and that they had gotten lost and would be there any moment.  We wanted to sit and order drinks while we waited.  It was a Monday night and the restaurant was less than half full.  She ignored my request.  My partner followed her and insisted that we be seated.  She finally agreed to seat us but gave us a an eye roll and dirty look.  Had it not been my daughter's birthday I would have left.  Our waiter was friendly and the food was good but not award winning good.  I like the atmosphere but honestly had a bad feeling after our encounter with the hostess.  I do not think I will return.

First, the noise was unbearable! We saw people walk out before ordering because of this.  Chris Bianco should be careful he doesn't have workman's comp claims for hearing loss.  I am serious about this. The arugula, peach & pecan salad had 3 small peach slices and NO pecans and very small amount of goat cheese,  The gnocchi was horrible.  A few of them were cold like they had been in the refrigerator and heated up. There was a glob of curdled goat cheese in one corner of the dish and no real sauce.  There were NO preserved lemons.  Another person in our party also had the same experience with her gnocchi.  Will never go back.  The quality of Chris Bianco's restaurants has gone way down.  Maybe he needs to oversee his kitchens and chefs a little more.  I am sorry for him because he has always worked so hard in this community.  I will say the service was good.",

One of the first things I noticed about the place was the atmosphere. Its like dining at grandma's with too many relatives in a small, cramped space. I definitely did not feel like I wanted to hang out there over a glass of wine or dessert for very long. Then the food was the final nail in the coffin. I noticed the prices went way up on the menu for pizza. I couldn't believe we were about to pay $18 for a small pizza and another $16 for a pasta dish. When the pasta arrived it was unbelievably small, under portioned, and tasted like a watered down version of a pasta dish I can get across the street for the same cost but triple the quantity. So we quickly grabbed our check at dined out at another restaurant to make up for the craptastic food from Italian Restaurant. Never again, not even if it was free.",

After our third wonderful visit last night, it's become our \"go to\" when we want a great meal, great ambiance, at a really reasonable price.  Each time we've gone, we've tried something new on the menu, and each one is better than the next.  The pasta with lamb was out of this world, but most likely you won't see it again, as Chris changes the menu regularly, depending on what's in season, and the most fresh. However, if you get a chance, try one of their mainstays,  the meatballs, whether in the sandwich, or alone with the most delicious marinara sauce and some of his out of this world bread. In fact, it was so good, we bought an extra order to bring home with us, and I ate it for breakfast this morning! We usually get a table, but last night we elected to sit at the bar, and were so happy we did. Mike and Lisa made the experience that much better, by making us feel welcome, like we were sharing a meal with friends. Oh, and if you like Mojitos, the house Mojito is insanely good. Only trouble is, so good, they go down really quickly! If you've been thinking about going, GO!!!  Do NOT wait!  Bravo Chris Bianco.  You've done it again!",

My wife had a butternut squash ravioli that she liked alot.  For the main meat dishes we tried the pork shank and the beef short ribs.  The pork shank was on the bland side and my wife commented her ribs was nothing special.  The desert, a flour-less type coffee cake, was ok but again, I was expecting more.  The decor is cute but needs to be more practical.  The smaller tables have trouble accomodating the big plates and the chairs are small short chairs that don't fit a normal size person comfortably.  Spent 120 dollars(before taxes/tip) for two with a beer and 1 large bottle of carbonated water but got charged 3 dollars for bread we had requested to go with our meals.",

    "text": "It took me awhile to finally eat at Italian Restaurant. I met the head chef on a plane from NY to Phoenix recently and told him I would definitely try it out soon so I moved it up on the list. We tried a number of dishes and sides and everything was good. We shared a salad with goat cheese, arugula and apples. It was wonderful.  All the pastas are made in-house. My wife had the cavatelli and she loved it. It had a cauliflower, fresh sausage and a great sauce. My gnocchi was not what I expected but I was not disappointed. The flavors were incredible. I'm used to gnocchi the way my grandmother made it but this was done in a pan in butter with sweet corn and pancetta. Wow. And the portion was big enough to take some home.   We had to try a few of the sides as well. I am pretty picky when it comes to meatballs and I rarely order them in a restaurant but I am always curious when they are on the menu as a side dish. I figure they must think their meatballs are pretty good. I was impressed. Best meatballs I've had in a long time. They also had a pork belly side dish. I liked it, my wife didn't. The flavors are very concentrated and strong.  We shared a rice pudding for dessert. Also the best I have had in a long time. I am usually disappointed when I order it (I keep trying though) but this one did not disappoint. We'll be back.",

    "text": "We went a couple nights ago and while it was easy to get a seat when we arrived around 6, it got crowded later and people were waiting. The service was inconsistent and we had too many different people bringing us food and drinks, which I found irritating. It took so long (half an hour or more maybe?) for my appetizer to come that it came minutes before the meals started coming, and everyone at the table had their meals arrive at a different time. To the servers credit, he did take my meal back to kitchen so I could eat the appetizer before my main dish. One of the meals was wrong and they replaced it as quickly as possible with the correct meal, which was appreciated. The food was fine, but nothing special. Mostly it seemed to lack flavor. The zucchini was recommended by one of our servers and it was interesting and I'm glad I got it. I didn't taste the mint until about a quarter of the way into it and that made a big difference in the taste of the dish, adding a level of complexity missing in the other dishes. Probably the biggest problem with the restaurant, however, was that it seemed to not have functioning air conditioning. It was ridiculously hot and stuffy and so uncomfortable to sit and eat, it would have been difficult to enjoy even the tastiest of meals. We all agreed that our experience was mediocre and would not make a special effort to return.",

We started with the Local Greens salad, and it was just that - greens with with a light dressing and a few kalamata olives on the side.  We also ordered the margherita pizza with fresh basil, mozzarella and the fennel sausage.  The pizza came out of the brick oven crispy.... but black around the entire top crust, and the bottom was covered in black spots.  It had a distinct burnt aftertaste.  We started in on a piece, but soon notified the staff of the issue.  They were extremely understanding and promptly took the burnt pizza away.  They immediately put in an order for another one, and it came out very quickly.  Still a bit blackened on parts of the crust, but better than the first time around.  I will say the toppings were excellent - fresh mozzarella and leaves of fresh basil with very tasty fennel sausage. Overall, the atmosphere was very trendy and pleasant, but the food just didn't win us over, especially for the price tag.",

Afterall, how could Oprah, Martha Stewart, and my hero Rachel Ray be wrong about something as simple as a pizza??? My boyfriend and I happened to be off on a Monday afternoon and so we made the drive up here to check this spot out.  This location is hard to find.  We even looked it up beforehand and called for directions.  In the 110+ temperatures we were all but about to give up finding it and head over to Potbelly's (which would have been better in hindsight) when we finally came across what I had thought to be a pizza oasis.  It was a mirage. We were seated promptly and given 4 small olives which were delicious, but it would be nice to have some bread and olive oil as well.  I mean, after all most people wait hours just to get in the door to this place.  I also thought the service was just OK.  No one went out of there way to recommend anything to us or even seem really friendly at all. The food did come quickly though and the topping were really good.  The fennel sausage was flavorful, the mozzarella fresh, and the basil was very tasty as well. It's the crust though that kills it for me.  Yes I am not an idiot and I know what brick oven crust tastes like.  It is typically charred and the crust is thin and chewy. Normally I really enjoy it, but here the middle was actually soggy.  It's a small pie, which is ok, but that crust was really bland and wet.   Also again I would love to have the olive oil and Parmesan to dip the crunchy ends in.  Sorry guys I just don't get it.  I have had better brick oven pizza at dozens of places in Chicago and I hafta say to all my foodie heroes I have been let down.",

Nevertheless, Enjoy the excellent food and carefully curated wine list.  The stars are all of the homemade pasta dishes and the meatballs, which are light but not full of filler. Just perfectly done. They recently installed a wood burning oven and now offer pizza; I haven't tried it but my spies tell me it pales in comparison to the Pizzeria. Overall I recommend Italian Restaurant, even though it sometimes drives me crazy.",

Service was efficient, although perhaps getting there at 5:30 and eating in the front room before the restaurant became super crowded helped. We shared a Biancoverde pizza, and each ordered an entree -- lasagna, papardelle and gnocchi, all very good. Are the pizzas as good here as at the original location? I'm not sure, because we haven't been there for years; however, when we did try the original we didn't feel that we had had a life-changing experience. This is still one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Of all the Bianco restaurants, Italian restaurant is by far my favorite.  It is the best of all three worlds; pizza, pasta and sandwiches, all with the familiar Chris Bianco style of fresh, local ingredients and food made from beginning to end all in house.   I would definitely say the worst thing about the restaurant is trying to decide what you want to eat!  You could always do what I did though and go with people who love to share!  We had three things the day I went for lunch: Josh's foraging fowls chicken salad with fingerling potato salad, house made mozzarella and prosciutto de Parma, and a special which included fresh made orecchiette pasta with sausage.  This was definitely one of those meals where you did not know what to eat first, because you weren't sure which dish you wanted to last the longest! Chef John Hall is also a great addition to the newest Bianco restaurant since his farm-to-table background is right in line with the restaurant's concept.  Hiring him was definitely a smart move on their behalf.  Sincerely looking forward to my next meal at one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants!",

When I called to get reservations for this one I was very pleased that they took reservations. Yes I do get the hype going with the simplicity of his cooking with the freshest ingredients available locally. That is simply what Italian food is about in Italy. Our son took us for Mothers Day and we all shared every course and had an exquisite 3 hour meal Italian style. Ordered each course as we went. Antipasti, a market Pizza that was heaven, Market salad, a fresh pasta dish, then the secondi, fab dessert w/coffee. The Chianti was excellent as well. This was the beginning of a new relationship with our palate and Chris Bianco's talents. Can't wait for our next rendezvous....",

It was empty and there were about six people standing around goofing off while we just sat there. The menus were completely wrong and after the staff had made \"my order\" which was pretty much whatever they felt like they asked me if it was ok. Service wise it got progressively worse from there. The food...let's start with the bread, it was so encrusted with cornmeal that it was extremely gritty as well as being overly salty. My pasta was bland and the sauce wasn't really a sauce at all but just butter with a few fried sage leaves. NEVER going back.",

If, however, you eat more than say a New York City runway model getting ready for Fashion week, then avoid attempting to eat here.  The first time I tried the Italian Restaurant (named with such apparent lack of energy it foreshadows the experience) I ordered a mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich, which was OK, but nothing fabulous. The portion was small, but not ridiculously so, and came with a small pile of plain, leafy greens tossed in olive oil. The sandwich consisted of a hard crusted bread, slice of mozzarella and paper thin slice of prosciutto - simple, plain and fairly bland.  I left unsatisfied, but not angry...  Not a great first try, but I'm a fan of Italian food and so loved Spasso that occupied this location prior to the Italian Restaurant, I decided to give it another shot.  Thinking that maybe I should move to the pasta section of the one page menu, that this is where the Italian in the Restaurant would shine through, I ordered the ravioli special.  It was, simply put, underwhelming!  There were 6 (I counted) square ravioli that were no bigger than the width of a typical fork.  Looking at the meager portion I thought, wow these must be incredible - at $12 for the dish, $2 a ravioli should be amazing.  Surprisingly, and unfortunately, this was definitely not the case.  They were again bland and topped with a simple, bland tomato sauce.  The size of this lunch dish was about what I'd expect for a tapa or a small appetizer.  I'm a big fan of smaller portions and higher quality, but its really hard for me to believe this was a serious attempt at a lunch portion for anyone.  Bottom line, I left hungry, disappointed to the point of feeling angry at being ripped-off and determined never to return!",

They stop making sandwiches at 4pm, so was a little disappointed I couldn't try it and they couldn't make an exception to make it. I understand that they couldn't but I still had to ask!! A girls gotta try! I ordered the margarita pizza and it comes with 6 slices. I will say the flavor was very good, but at the same time I've had many good wood fired margarita pizzas that were similar. I shared this with one other person and unfortunately the three slices did not fill me up because they were so thin and not a lot of toppings. I may go back to try the sandwich during the day, but for a $15 pizza that didn't fill me up or blow me away, I will not go out of my way to come here for pizza.",

And, then, my husband asked for bread and olive oil which also took another 10 min and had a \"dollop\" of olive oil. Our waitress never asked us if we had any questions re: the menu, once we ordered she never came back to ask if we needed anything else or if the food was to our liking.   Food is fresh and tastes good.  The portions are smaller than most restaurants but we did not find that a problem.  We shared the fennel salad, both had a main course, a glass of wine each and our bill was $70! Now that is expensive, especially when the restaurant's service is way below expectations for this chef's restaurant.

First visit I tired a sandwich Besides being well overpriced for what you get to begin with a friend with me asked for a little Balsamic vinegar however that would be an up charge.  Sodas come in bottles so if you drink more and one it of course cost you more.   The food was not bad but I would not describe it as great either the bead was hard to bite through tough and grilled hard on the outside.  Second time I was sort of dragged back in we a group was headed to another place when everyone besides me was all wanting to go try it.  So I go in with intentions of spending a bit more for a pasta dish remembering how I left hungry with a sandwich last time.  BAD IDEA I bought the Spaghetti very lack luster simple pasta and tomato sauce the noodles were cooked quite well but the sauce reminded me of that hunts canned sauce I use to by when I was on a tight budget fresh out of college.  Garlic bread.. oh wait I forgot no bread everything is up charged I didn't go past the 16 bucks I was already spending for the so so tiny portion of pasta I was already given and a soda. I figured I would be better off finding the vending machine in the office later for filler.  Bottom line for me Decent tasting food very small portions High prices will not return even if the group all decides that's where they are going again.  Why spend that much for lunch and still have to find something more to eat on the way back to the office?",

Couldn't they offer to put us at a different table (since 4 of our party had already left; or combine tables for the other party?

I looked at the table next to us and the one behind and their pizza was burned also. then I remember seeing the place on the morning news and it coming out burned and I said remind me not to go there. so my mistake I went to try it.  why this place is on national best pizza lists confuses me. I have had pizza in ten places in nyc that are far better. I am guessing they use real moz.  but most of the pizza had no cheese. so yeah im very disapoointed. my budy warned me that it wasnt that great. and I posted this on facebook asking. no one I know likes this place. so do not be fooled by it making best of lists. and the service. never came back to ask how the food was. so I didnt bother telling them it burned.  they have soda bottles like mexico.and today out of diet coke. What kinda pizzeria doesnt have a soda fountain. the one meal that soda really is required along with mexican. and the old chair I was sitting in was rock hard. the problem was that it wobbled.  terrible restaunt. avoid it please. dont say I didnt warn you",

Don't get me wrong the color white is an elegant color, however pizzeria Bianco wasn't reflecting it when we experienced it!  Pizza was ok not what we expected, being born and raised in Chicago and frequent visitors to NY maybe tainted our experience because pizza in those cities is amazing not to mention Florence Italy too.  We tried 2 pizzas wise guy and the white pizza BiancoVerde.  But ok maybe we remember it's Phoenix.   Maybe it would have tasted better had our server whose service was equivalent to the personality of a soap dish, very dry and added nothing to the experience of Phoenix big town, small town charm to the meal.  We thought a robot could have done a better job.  His partners in the service made it bearable but we left saying,\" never again\". There are other options in the valley that make a pie that is good even delicious, with service reflecting the charm of Phoenix.",

    "text": "I struggled with this review, because there are several very different aspects to Chris Bianco's Italian Restaurant...  Taste - Fantastic. You could drink the tomato sauce and be happy. It is some amazingly tasty stuff, and not a bite went back to the kitchen. Most of it was because of the taste, but even our really bland apple tart was entirely eaten because the...  Portions - Really small. This was part of why no bite went uneaten. They definitely favor quality over quantity, and I'm usually the first person to champion that cause. I hate giant restaurant portions. But this was too far the other way.  Service - Not bad, when we could get their attention. There are several community tables and sometimes different servers seemed to have different stations at the same table. And as small as the place was, it was oddly difficult to get anyones attention to place our order, get a refill, or anything else.  Ambiance - Love the look and feel, from the clean/industrial ceiling to the Bianco art on the wall. It was fun to just look around the place while we waited at our table (which we did a lot of)  Cost - The place isn't cheap. You get what you pay for in terms of quality, but I think they are really, really going for the high-end foodie with lots of disposable income. We left not really feeling full in spite of dropping a fairly sizable check on the table.   I recommend giving it a try, especially if you are really a fan of fresh flavors. If you're looking for a really amazing overall meal at this price point, I think there are better options around.",

    "text": "I need to start with a warning... I have a love/hate relationship with Chris Bianco. I love his food, but hate his restaurants. This love/hate continues now with his new venture The Italian Restaurant.  My husband and I decided to try Italian Restaurant tonight. We arrived about 6:15, we knew from past experience with Bianco restaurants, go during the week and go early.   Note: It is tucked away in the Town and Country shopping center. You will not see any signage until you walk towards the restaurant area of the shopping center.  It is a tiny place with not many tables. There is a communal table. I despise communal tables. If I wanted to eat with random people I will join a commune. Anyways, I digress. So we were seated a small table for two. Now this is where the hate comes in. Small table next to another small table. ughh!!!  Also, if you are looking to have a conversation with anyone in the restaurant, good luck with that. Not only was talking to my husband difficult, I could not hear anything the waiter was saying. I can just imagine if it was that hard to hear on a week night what a weekend would be.  Next area of contention is the patio. Ahh this is what I love/hate of Mr. Bianco. Just like Pizzeria, there are seats on the patio but of course you can not order there. Just extra seats for waiting. Now this is genius from a noncomsumer side. Keep the customer comfortably seated while waiting, plus add some wine/beer to the mix. So even if the even customer ends up \"peacing out\" before dinner, you already made your money on the overly priced alcohol. GENIUS. (prime example Bar Bianco, next to Pizzeria Bianco). Now why I hate this. It could be used for more seating!!!!!! Less wait time. I dont know about you, but my time is just a precious as Chris Bianco's!!  Last complaint, the server was extremely rude. Not sure if he was having a bad night, but anytime I would ask a question or make a clever joke (ok maybe corny joke) he would give me the worse look or answer my question like I was dumb. THe menu is small and many different dishes, so questions will be raised. He also rushed us. I understand that there is a wait and they need to turn over table, but I want to at least feel relaxed, especially when paying higher prices for meatballs.  So why am I giving the restaurant 3 stars?? THE FOOD! It was awesome. Just when I want to have a reason to dislike Bianco, his food reminds me of why I am there in the first place. All 3 stars go to food. The other faults just are too much to be ignored.  We started with the house bread and olive oil. Bread is AWESOME. Does he need to charge $2 for it, probably not, but he knows that more likely than not you are going to cough up $2 for bread. Again, GENIUS!  I had the meatballs and polenta. It was delicious. Was it worth the price ($18) ehh not so much. But again, when in Bianco's restaurant expect to pay a little more  Overall, I plan on returning sometime in the distant future, just not tomorrow.",

Maybe it's just me, but I never feel right paying out the ass for pasta. What I had was terrific, but was it THAT much more terrific than what I could've made at home? Yes, probably, but if I'm going to splurge on a cuisine, it's going to be sushi or Indian. Or pizza, I suppose. That's what I loved about Pizzeria Bianco: you felt like you were getting the best pizza in the country for a song. Italian Restaurant is not like that at all.  Also, our service wasn't so hot. I'm talking 10 minute gaps between seating and drink orders and food orders. We'll be back, and maybe, like dave w.'s review below, it'll get better. I hope so.",

We were disapointed that the servings were really small but good. We had the spagheti pomodoro. We were also very disappointed that the chocolate cake they serve was the same as they serve at Pan Bianco and it was three dollars more.   The service was ok but did not care too much for the hostess. She was some what unpolished. I did not care too much for the communal table, it reminded me of Chipotle grill. the atmosphere was noisey and echoed a lot.   I will probably try the Italian restaurant again.",

    "text": "I first went to Italian restaurant before they had a license to sell any type of alcohol.  It was probably only open a week or 2, but I went with a group of six, and we felt that while the food was OK (3.5 stars at best), after ordering about 6 dishes, none of us were even close to full, and the prices were quite high.  I didn't go back for months because of this.  Recently, a friend told me that the food had changed, and I had to go back and try it, especially for lunch.  I decided to go with a few co-workers, and all of us thought the food was excellent, and the value was apparent.  The 3 dishes ordered were the meatball sandwich, spaghetti with tomato sauce, and cavatelli with sausage and cauliflower.  Every dish was great, and the portions were huge.  It was served with great bread and olive oil, and the service was great.  I went back for dinner a couple of weeks later with 3 of the 6 guests that were at our first foray to Italian Restaurant, and all 3 were skeptical about going.  However, once we got the food, all were very happy that I had convinced them to give it another shot.  We had the mixed grill, which had local sausage and roasted chicken with roasted veggies.  We also ordered 2 pastas, which was more than enough for the 4 of us.  At the end of dinner, the chef sent out a free dessert, which was a cake that was excellent.    Since I work close to Italian Restaurant, I will go back for lunch at least 2 times a month, which is how often I go to Pane Bianco, which has a couple of my favorite sandwiches in town.",

    "text": "I rarely write reviews but I have now eaten at Italian Restaurant a few times and, after reviewing some of the other Yelpers opinions, I felt like I had to write this because this place is great and deserves kudos. Wow, some of you yelpers are so picky about things that have so little to do with what a Chris Biano restaurant is known for- the food!  Every dish I have ordered so far has been delicious and satisfying. You can taste the freshness and quality in everything you order at Italian Restaurant. The talent in the kitchen is apparent in the complex flavors found in some of the simpler items found here such as the amazing cornmeal laden bread and the perfect meatballs. The portions are just right- just enough to satsify without sending you out the door overstuffed.  The dining is quaint and shabby chic. Some of the other reviewers have complained about the small chairs and tables or the large family style seating but to them I say- have you never been to a Chris Bianco restaurant before? If so you should already know what to expect. If you don't like it then don't go! The rest of us who know that you go to a Chris Bianco restaurant to enjoy the food will be happy to fill your empty spots.   I am giving Italian Restaurant four stars for now because I think that they have a few new restaurant kinks to work out but have no doubt that once they get things running smoothly 5 stars will be my permanent rating. I will definitely be back- often!",

Well, maybe that wasn't the best idea.  Portions here are much, much smaller than you'd expect.    The food was definitely high quality but, honestly, nothing to rave about.  The pasta was flavorless and the \"special sour cherries\" in the appetizer just tasted like cherry pie filling.  The bread was top notch though, especially dipped in the sauce from the pasta.    The place has a lovely, warm ambiance and the open kitchen is awesome.  I would have loved to sit on their beautiful patio, but it wasn't open yet.  Service was impeccable and should be noted.    I would maybe come back for bread and wine.  I was just a little disappointed in the main event.",

I had the eggplant strozzapreti and my husband had the gnocchi, they portion size was large and the pasta was fresh and full of well put together flavors.

In my multiple experiences of visiting this location and the original one downtown, I have no reason to doubt it. For my money, it's certainly the best pizza I've had.   I've tried all the pizzas on the menu and the two that I recommend most are the Margarita and Wiseguy. Both having different appeal, the Margarita is superb. The tomato sauce is fresh, juicy, and not too sweet. The mozzarella cheese is easily the best I've ever had on a pizza - smooth, firm, and properly salted, it is a wonder on its own merit. Finally, there's the crust, crisp and bubbled on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. Combine the three elements together with fresh basil leaves on top and for me, it's the best pizza there is.  As for the Wiseguy, any meat lovers will adore this masterpiece. A white pizza, this one features fennel sausage and roasted onions along with the aforementioned mozzarella. Both the sausage and onion carry a smoky flavor that is enhanced by the smooth creaminess of the mozzarella. This applies to both pizzas but I highly recommend adding garlic to the pizza for an added flavor dimension.   Overall, this is easily the best pizza in Arizona, with apologies to Pomo, Cibo, and Federal. As for the best in the country, perhaps that's a better question for someone with extensive experience. For me though, I see no reason to doubt the claim.",

Pizzeria Bianco is legendary for great pizzas, I don't know what happened. I ordered the Margherita, and sadly, there was hardly any sauce on it, there was less cheese than I expected. It was so dry, probably the worst pizza I've ever had. I thought it must be my imagination, because everyone loves their pizza. Since I love cold pizza, I saved half, and thought the next day I would realize how great it was. I didn't even see sauce on it. Dry and flavorless. My friend ordered the Sonny Boy, and didn't enjoy his either. Maybe it was an off night for the chef, I don't know, but I won't go again.",

My mom got the pappardelle which had the perfect blend of flavors and melt-in-your-mouth freshly made pasta. I had the Sonny Boy pizza and I really appreciated the fresh mozzarella - it was the perfect amount and really refreshing. Our food also came out quickly; they literally just whipped it up and sent it out. Can't wait to go back!",

From the simple greens, to the Margherita, WiseGuy, flourless chocolate cake and the rice pudding with rhubarb compot on top. Even with 3 small children the service was friendly and prompt with their pasta before our dishes, alleviating the whining and fidgeting for a brief time. Great ambiance is perfect for a date night as well.  Would recommend putting a couple Oregon Pinots on the wine list; showcasing the more appropriate northern varietals would set you apart from every place that defaults to California grapes.  Recommend dropping someone off to check in before parking (next to a TJ's...lot always full).",

    "text": "I was so disappointed by our experience at this restaurant. I've wanted to try Pizzeria Bianco for a long time - it is on a national list of best pizza places in the country, and it's in my city. Plus they serve my favorite style of pizza, so we should have been in for a treat.  It started before we even got to see a menu. We walked in on a Monday night and there were various open tables in the front room, we couldn't see in the back. There was one 2-top open and two 4-tops. I asked if we could have a 4-top because we like to sit next to each other when we go out, and it was our anniversary. The hostess then went on a rant about how she has to seat us at a table for two in case bigger parties come in, so that she can have the other tables open, but since we are the customer she has to seat us where we want, yada yada... I was a hostess for years, I know how that works, but I've never actually told a customer all of that because in my opinion the right answer is always \"yes,\" unless you actually have reservations for bigger parties and you have to save those tables. So after huffing and puffing, she sat us at the worst of all of the tables, right in front of the door and the kitchen, so there was a ton of traffic going past us all night and the door was opening and shutting, blowing cold air on us. This really bothered me because the other two tables were beautiful, quiet, and the other 4-top was more secluded near a window. Our view was of the front door, which is not really where I want to be looking when I am enjoying an anniversary date. Our table was just awkward and I felt so uncomfortable with the other (better) open tables around us.   Throughout our meal the hostess proceeded to seat parties of two at the other tables...  Our server came and took our order, and brought us bread and oil. I know some reviewers complained about the oil and bread being bland, but I actually enjoyed the delicate flavors of the oil.  We ordered two pizzas and our server seemed disappointed that we didn't order more.   The pizzas left something to be desired. They were really under seasoned and tasteless. We ordered the Wise Guy and the Margherita pizzas. The Margherita is my favorite kind of pizza, and the pizza I use to judge most restaurants. The basil was fresh but the flavor of the tomato sauce was really lacking the level of freshness and robust flavor of other restaurants. The Wise Guy really needed salt. Usually with this type of pizza I can eat most of one by myself because of the thin crust, but I barely finished 3 pieces.  Our server never came to check on us.   The only good thing I can say is at least the Margherita tasted better as cold leftovers.",

The location doesn't lend a whole lot to the ambiance but the interiors and outdoor seating are pretty good.What matters the most though, the pie and the wine selection. Decent mix of local and international full bodied wines. The test has to be based on a margherita and a white pie for which I pick the Wiseguy (it has pistachios). Also threw in a gnocchi for good measure since was with an equally hungry friend. The margherita thin, crispy and flavorful. The wise one with pistachios equally good. The unexpected winner was the creamy and home made fresh potato pasta gnocchi.   Bianco not only lived up to NYC standards, might even beaten a few good ones in Brooklyn. Enough said, a bit pricey but definitely deserves a stop on a good night for locals and tourists alike !",

    "text": "Homemade & authentic   After enjoying the downtown pizzeria bianco I was happy to hear of the location in town & country.  My mom and I met here for dinner on a week night.  We did not have a reservation but there was no wait.  This bianco has 2 main dining areas decorated in a modern shabby chic style that feels home, vintage and elegant.    We shared a bottle of Lambrusco which was delicious.  For dinner we shared a wise guy pizza ($18-amazing) and the gnocchi w summer corn which was only ok.  The wise guy was a salty Caramelized yummy dream atop chewy homemade authentic pizza dough.  Love it always.  The gnocchi was a tad more firm almost crunchy, which is not how most gnocchi is served.  The pancetta bits were a little chewy and not crispy like I was hoping for.  The Arizona sweet corn was basically a drier creamed corn underneath the pasta.  I took a pizza home for my hunny- half wise guy & half rosa.  The rosa was nice & tangy with the light crunch of pistachios yum!  Our server was timely & obviously loved the food here.  We took our time with dinner & enjoyed ourselves.  Since we visited weeks ago I have a longing to return...  Only downside was dinner for 2 and 1 to go pizza was over $150!  Do not come here to get a deal that's for sure!",

    "text": "I have been to Pizzeria Bianco once before with two friends, but this last time? It was something so special and Pizzeria Bianco made it something to remember. It was my 26th birthday back on January 18th, and my boyfriend had \"told\" me we were coming here for dinner, just the two of us and had planned a little menu for us and already ordered my favorite wine (Lioco Chardonnay). This did fool me because I assumed that this Restaurant would be a great place to put personal touches to a special night, such as a select menu for two. WELL?   I walked into the restaurant with my boyfriend and was escorted to the back room by the hostess, turned and there was a table, 20 people full, all of my family, friends, my boyfriends family, and a restaurant to cheer them along when they yelled \"Surprise\" and \"Happy Birthday\". Pizzeria Bianco had already been taking care of them with antipasti, wine and beer. Once I sat down after the tears of surprise/joy and hugs, the food started to come out, perfectly cooked! This was all done family style too.   To Start: Antipasti, local greens, Spiedini (wood fire skewers of prosciutto wrapped fontina) Dinner: Grilled Basil Chicken, Roasted pork shoulder Pizzas: Wiseguy, Rosa, Margherita   Sides: Risotto, Vegetarian Lasgna   We ended with a Cake from Barbs Bakery that Pizzeria Bianco was kind enough to keep in the back and slice after they presented it to me, candles and all. We finished our meal with smooth espressos and cappuccinos.   THANK YOU Pizzeria Bianco, your restaurant is so well run, quaint, and with some of the best food in town. You threw the best birthday for such a large party and never once skipped a beat. I could of not been surprised with a better birthday dinner location than this.",

My family brought me here for father's day and as far as bad experiences go, this was the Mack Daddy.    I normally don't complain about having too much topping on a pizza but the amount of Soppresata salami they put on our pizza was criminal, making it so greasy and soggy even my pizza loving son could not eat it.  Strangely enough, the salami tasted stale and the crust was burnt far more than the desirable amount.  Our server was a ghost after taking our order, more concerned with re-stocking the bar than checking in on us.  I am extremely disappointed as I held chef Bianco in such high regard, but after this experience I may need to think carefully before recommending his establishments to anyone else.",

Our hotel was across the street but we had a very busy day so we wanted a nice meal. Aa we are looking over the menu and chatting with hostess and the super friendly tall women, we decided this was definitely the place for us. My only complaint at this point and for the rest of the meal is that the menu has this amazing salad listed as small plates... Which is super confusing because all the items listed actually all come together in an amazing salad. Thankfully while I was reading it over - it didn't make sense to me that goat cheese would be served by itself, small plate or not, so I asked what it came with and they explained it was all one amazing salad. That completly sealed the deal for me deciding to eat here. We ordered the salad and a pizza and both were amazing Highly recommend this place if you are in the area.. Or if not..

Great space, wonderful smell in the air (oak and pecan wood cooking your pies), absolutely top-notch service and flavors that have us dreaming of a quick return. We got the Wiseguy and the pappardelle with ragu, and we were pretty amazed with the flavors and textures of both. Only thing was that the Wiseguy was a little soggy in the middle, but that's a style thing and it's also got to do with the piles of fennel and onion on this sausage/smoked mozzarella pie. Wow, was it good, though! The pappardelle was actually al dente (Who goes to a pizza place to get pasta? - it's worth doing here!) and appeared housemade. The ragu was fantastic. The servers brought us great olives (we turned down the bread, as we weren't starving) and chile oil and flakes, as well as water, beer (go for the IPA - the one I had was solidly good) and wine.   And then we ran into Chef on the way out the door. Cool!  Anyway, I'd go back tomorrow . . . too bad it'll have to wait until the next time we're in Phoenix.",

I have plenty more to say about Pizzeria Bianco but if you're one of the millions of people who don't read past the first sentence of anything, you get the gist.   Normally I'm not a fan of businesses who don't take reservations and have a huge line out the door. However, Bianco manages the high volume pretty well. Our party five arrived right at opening hours and were seated inside within  15 minutes. Had we opted for outside, it could've been even sooner.  Experiencing trendy pizza with parents can be questionable. They don't always understand why ingredients beyond pepperoni are added. Mine threw caution to the wind and let my husband and i order for the table. Not surprisingly, they loved the Margherita pizza the best. I liked the signature white pie crust. My husband loved it all.  It's upscale casual, like a lot of places in Scottsdale. Guests were on dates, with their kids, or like us in a mid-sized group. Service was hip but not snotty. It's pretty much my dream pizza joint.",

We also ordered the spiedini, a mozzarella, tomato and basil appetizer and the margherita pizza. The spiedini was very good the appetizer was ok I expected it to be fresher it was kind of warm actually. The Margherita pizza is ok, it actually didn't have much flavor. The staff is very attentive and nice. This is a restaurant that I would maybe be willing to give it a second try in the future.",

I wasn't that jazzed initially when my husband showed me the menu - the toppings didn't seem that innovative, and the prices seemed....too much for pizza.  Little did I know the magic that must go on in the Pizzeria Bianco kitchen and oven.  We started with the fresh and warm bread that is served to each table - the crumb on the bread was airy and the olive oil it was served with was   We ordered a seasonal salad - arugula, candied pecans, ricotta salata, pears, and a light dressing.  Humble ingredients - dynamite when together.  I was very taken with the salad and we got an ample size for $10.  We split a pizza - it was enough for 2 if you ate all the bread provided (we did) and had an appetizer.  Otherwise, order a pizza each.  The pizza we ordered was the Sonny Boy (with olives only on half).  The salami on the pizza was very thinly sliced and nicely crisp from the wood-fired oven.  The cheese was perfectly melty.  Lastly, our service was fantastic.  We had one main waiter, but many people to tended to our table to ensure that our food came out quickly and that our glasses were never empty.  Top that all off with the right level of mood lighting (not so low that you strain to see, but low enough to be romantic) and we had a wonderful time.",

Anyhow, I came here with a large group of family and friends, and we all just ordered family-style with several different pizzas, pastas, and appetizers to share.   I was not disappointed by a single thing we ordered, but the highlight of our dinner was the BiancoVerde pizza. The pastas were also delicious. I was able to try both the Lasagne and the Pappardelle, with the latter being my favorite of the two. The Pappardelle is served with a robust and flavorful meat bolognese sauce that is sure to please. Honestly, the quality of just about everything I tired was unparalleled to some similar places I've tried in the Valley.  The interior is also small and intimate, and makes you feel like you're eating dinner at home with family. Service was good and attentive for a large group, so no complaints there. PB definitely lived up to the hype I've heard! Overall, it was a great experience and we will all be sure to be back soon!",

    "text": "We had dinner here last night as an extension of Valentine's Day--I had read lots of recommendations and was excited to try it (Chris Bianco won the James Beard Award for Best Chef: Southwest in 2003). We had a reservation for 7:30--which was essential on a Saturday night. The place was packed. My appetite was whetted when we walked by a window into the kitchen and watched the preparation of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil (Insalata Caprese). There was also a tray of lovely dried tomatoes bathed in olive oil sitting nearby, always a good sign. We had to wait for about twenty minutes, but there is a wine bar where you can get a glass of something to help pass the time. We were seated in the large room at the back--there are three spaces: a patio, a smaller dining room in the bar area, and the main room behind, all very noisy by the way--so if that bothers you, you won't be happy. Service was prompt, courteous, friendly, and very professional.They brought us a basked of pane with olive oil. The o.o. was light and grassy tasting, delicious, and the bread was artisanal and divine. Chris Bianco clearly knows what to do with flour and yeast.  I ordered a small plate of mozzarella with tomatoes and basil, followed by a pizza biancoverde--white pizza with mozzarella and topped with fresh local arugula. The mozzarella is home-made and delicious, the tomatoes were luscious. My pizza confirmed the restaurant's reputation as being the best pizzeria in Arizona. Great slightly charred crust, Naples style, beautiful combo of fresh cheese, herbs, and arugula. I loved it! My husband had the parpardelle with meat sauce, which was also excellent--but I'm glad I had pizza. One pizza probably wouldn't feed two people--as it was, I was able to share about a third of it with my husband and went home feeling very well fed (as did he). We will definitely be back. This restaurant is a national treasure!",

    "text": "AWFUL. This is my first Yelp - and I go to new places every day. I frequent places like Postino, the Parlor, St. Francis. Based on their website this looks like it fits into the same category. Nope!   First off, I'll admit that on a rainy Monday I had a hankering for soup at Baby Kays. Didn't know they are gone, so I walked across and thought - why not try a new place. I was already disappointed so I'll give them that; maybe I'm just over critical today. You be the judge. I arrived at 1pm and the place was very busy. The greeter was unkept with wet hair and seemed to have no clue. I just opted to sit at the bar.   Bar: Restaurant design 101 - SEATING! My pursehook (kudos for at least having this) was between the legs. Add that my knees still hit the wall and I'm still a good foot away from my plate and I look like the hunchback of Notre Dame at a nice dining establishment. I'm 5'3\". Imagine a taller person sitting there. Not only did I drop a bite - so did my spaghetti eating neighbor. I'd be fairly interested to see how much food lands on the floor at that bar or how many more seats could they fit there if it weren't from men & women sitting spread eagle up to it.  Also, call me old fashioned, the bartender should always be behind the bar. Never was one. I wasn't needing drinks; I just think someone should be there. Maybe they were severely understaffed at 1pm on a rainy Monday?   My water glass was never refilled; I sat right next to the 'water station' at the bar, where the waitress repeatedly slammed it down next to me. Yet my glass remain empty. Perhaps if there were a bartender present?  Food: First off, I am gluten-free (not by choice). The menu is absolutely the furthest place you'd ever want to go for a gluten-free person. McDonalds has more options. Typically - Italian is not my forte with all the breads and pastas, but most all restaurants have enough options to keep a GF person happy. Many Italian restaurants make their own gluten-free pastas and pizzas - Picazzo is a favorite.   My choice? The simple salad and their wood roasted mushroom side. What I got was a plate with a mound of oily leaves and 3 seeded olives. That's it. Oily lettuce. No choice of dressing. The mushrooms were a plate full of standard button mushrooms sauteed in...you guessed it...oil! I was imagining wood fired, wild mushrooms with a twist that only this chef could create. No flavor whatsoever. I tried to trick my tastebuds with salt and switching from one bite to the other (salad, mushroom), sans water. It was so disgusting. Being that I waited so long to eat I shoveled it in to satisfy my stomach, give my knees a break and got the heck out of there.   All for a staggering $23. Would you? Sorry Chef Bianco - one lunchtime midcentral foodie fail. I have no interest in returning to this restaurant, nor trying any of the sister restaurants and am now even more eager when the long time Phoenix staple Baby Kays returns at the old Richardsons location in November!",

    "text": "I had read the reviews of Pizzeria Bianco, and I thought I'd give them a try. I stopped in to place a to go order. The hostess was disinterested in me even before I told her I was ordering to go. She led me to the bar where Blaise took my order. I saw him talking to other guests at the bar, so I knew he could be friendly, but he had very little time for my order. He took the order with very few words exchanged, and a few minutes later he left me the bill. He didn't bother to ask if I wanted a drink while I waited or even offer me a glass of water. So, I was surprised that when he came to pick up my cash payment, that he asked me \"do you need change back?\" I rarely leave without giving a tip, even on a to go order I usually don't leave less than 10%, but he had been so dismissive of me I told him yes I did want my change. I got my meal and left. The pizza was okay, and the service was lousy. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Stopped in here to have lunch with the gf. After 5 years in the Valley I decided I would try it. Got seated right away for lunch at this newer location, so no wait. Thankfully, because if I had waited at all I would be rating this a 1 or 2.  This location, much like the other location, is hard to find and hidden. That's pretentious, plenty of restaurants want your business. This place acts like you need to earn it. We ordered a margharita with extra sausage and waited for our minds to be blown. They were. How can so many people love this pizza. It's average at best. Great fresh sausage and great basil, I'll admit, but the crust was either too burnt or too doughy. Maybe the ovens/employees at the original location are better, but unless the pizza is completely different, it will still be vastly overrated.  The service was quick, the waitress was no BS, and it really wasn't too expensive. The pizza was enough for 2 for lunch. If I liked the food, automatic 4. I honestly didn't like the pizza. That place assumes it knows what you like on your pizza, and that place does not know what I want on my pizza. I like good crust, cheese, sauce, and options. This place doesn't have much of any of those.",

    "text": "I, like everyone else, have been hearing about Pizzeria Bianco for YEARS. Even though I'm an AZ native and have had every opportunity to try the location downtown, I could just never deal with the wait. I dined at the Town and Country location attempting to not be influenced by the reputation of this Phoenix pizza champ, and this is what I came up with:  The restaurant is very inviting and, simply put, pretty. We were seated immediately outside (on a Monday at 6pm). Our sever was very attentive and helpful with the wine list. Alcohol service was slow, but that happens.   The antipasti was very good. Beets, carrots, dry cheese with peppercorns, salumi and the crusty bread acted as a great starter. We had the biancoverde pizza with added fennel sausage. I know the white pizza with its multiple cheeses and arugula is meant to be simple and flavorful on its own, but the sausage really made it. I don't have any real complaints. It was a good pizza. I guess I just expected more. Going off of just this one experience, I would take Cibo over Bianco any day.  The big shocker was the dessert. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but my friend ordered the flourless chocolate cake and it was absolutely fantastic. I never get nutty over desserts, but this was one I will remember.  Between the two of us, we had a bottle of wine, an appetizer, a pizza and a dessert for around $100. Not bad at all as far as price points go. I did enjoy Pizzeria Bianco, but I was a bit underwhelmed. Will try it again one day if I get tired of my other favorite Phoenix pizza joints.",

    "text": "* * * *  A bottle of white, a bottle of red Perhaps a bottle of rose instead We got a table against the wall It had an old familiar air My friends and I, sitting chair to chair  A bottle of red, a bottle of white It all depended upon our appetite We met for dinner, it was nonchalant In Chris Bianco's Italian Restaurant. * * * *   Within the Town and Country shopping center lies Chris Bianco's Italian Restaurant, a nod to simple, unpretentious Italian-American cuisine.  There is an emphasis on home-made, fresh ingredients, as is evident in the hand-made pastas and slow-cooked meats.  We were first served some lovely crostini with a creamy cheese (Maybe ricotta?).  We also decided on getting the cheese platter appetizer, which consisted of Brie, sheep's milk cheese, and goat milk cheese with orange marmalade and candied pecans.  It was served with a basket of bread, and a single buttery looking crostini on the cheese plate.  The bread was a little too chewy for my tastes, but the cheeses were quite nice, especially with the marmalade and pecans.    For main courses, I ordered the crespelle, and also tried the porchetta and papardelle.  The crespelle is like the Italian version of a savory crepe.  It had freshly made ricotta, spinach, and garlic, with a hearty, chunky tomato sauce.  The crespelle tasted decent, although there were large halved pieces of garlic in the filling that still had some \"bite\" to them because they weren't fully cooked.  The papardelle I tried had a nice meaty ragu to accompany the fresh pasta.  The porchetta was easily the best item out of all our meals.  The slow-roasted pork was very tender, and the sauce had a nice full flavor that matched well with the pork, black-eyed peas, and root vegetables.    I was kind of torn on what to give Italian Restaurant rating-wise, since the pasta dishes, although impressive that they were freshly made, just tasted OK to me (A 3 star for just the pasta).  However, the porchetta and friendly service helped tip the scales so I'll upgrade to a 4 star rating.",

The pizza was made in a brick oven which gave it that perfect crispiness that I always look for when eating pizza. I ordered a pie that came with onions, sausage and cheese.. no marinara.

It's hard to evaluate whether the pizza has changed in the intervening years, but I suppose I am a little less impressed than I used to be.  Neapolitan pizza is much more widely available than it used to be, and a lot of the novelty of the Pizzeria Bianco experience has worn off.  Arugula on pizza, for example, seems to be found all over the place.  It is admittedly the style of Neapolitan pizzas to be thin crust and light on toppings, but, still, it feels like you are paying a high price for a lot of white flour.  The menu is short and the toppings don't seem to be particularly labor intensive or require too much in the way of craft or artistry.  Bottom line: pretty good pizza but perhaps not anything too special.",

Quick service which is always great, but talk about feeling unwelcome! For a first timer, it would've been nice to be introduced to the menu instead of asking 101 questions. That seems to be a problem I've been reading through other reviews. The servers seem to dislike assisting their customers when it comes to the menu. I really wanted to like this place but it's not worth a second visit. 2 stars for the delicious food. -3 stars for the service and overall atmosphere.",

I could see into the kitchen and watched the cook making nice big balls of mozzarella. I asked if we could take balls to go and unfortunately they don't sell it that way. We had the mozzarella and tomato on Focaccia bread and the tomato and mozzarella salad. Both were moist and mouth watering! We loved it so much we  ordered a plain pizza to go. The pizza was cooked on a beautiful wood burning stove but it was just ok. The pizza was sort of dry and disappointed it wasn't better since this seems to be their speciality. The interior of this place is super cute and the back dining room was even more cute. Shabby chic is the decor and it fit perfectly. Almost felt as if we were in someone's home. Service was quick and prompt. Would have given 5 stars if the pizza was better.",

    "text": "Abandoned by my wife, I was forced to fend for myself in a new city. So I found this place through an eater article for lunch.   Granted I came during off hours, service was excellent. It's kind of silly but I was sitting outside and the wind swept away my napkin. By the time I picked it up, the waiter had a new napkin for me. Slightly stalker-ish but there weren't a lot of people there so I appreciated the extra attention.   Service started with two black olives and a green olive. Since I was a little hesitant about olives at first, the waiter brought out some bread and olive oil as well.   Since it was just me, I went classic and got the Margherita pizza. Pizza was pretty good but not the best that I've had. Thin crust, crispy yet yielding. Wood fired oven gave it a nice cook with a little bit of that char. Sauce was solid, but would have preferred it a touch sweeter and a little more acid.   Finished off the pizza and decided on a whim to get a lemon curd. It was a lot for one person but bursting with lemon flavor. They topped it with a vanilla cream and two soft and crumbly shortbread cookies on the side to counterpunch the sour. Thought it worked well. Recommended for those who like citrus.   Based on the pizza alone I might have rounded down from 3.5 to 3, but the service certainly made it an enjoyable meal.   4/5.",

Definitely try out the downtown one just to \"experience\" it but nothing is different.   Live almost across the street so we venture here often. They have a really good pie - fresh ingredents, great crust. I just cant give them a full 5 stars based on price. For a thin smaller size pizza, they are a tad bit pricey but hey...least you get good food for your money",

Love the complimentary top notch bread & olive oil. Just divine. I consider drinking the leftover olive oil each time there's a drop left. It's seriously that good. Instead of salad we got the Spiedini wood fired skewers of proscuitto wrapped fontina & while on the salty side of life it was really good ingredients & simply delish. I'd recommend it with a stiff whiskey drink or full bodied red to tame the salt. I was sporting the fresh brewed iced tea as the DD & it was a bit much. Love this place from start to finish. Service, ambiance & of course the simple Italian dishes with superior ingredients will keep us coming back for years to come.",

I personally haven't tried any of the appetizers or other entrees, I usually go there and just get pizza and they are always amazing.

FIVE DOLLARS!    Listen, I've made money, had money, lost money; it's my opinion that $5 for sausage on a 10-12\" pizza is pure narcissism.  It's just silly.

The wood fired oven brings a wonderful smoky char to the crust that you only get from wood or coal ovens. The pizza also comes out super quick because of the higher oven temps. The sauce was a perfect tangy tomato. Just the right amount of fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. The fresh mushrooms provided an earthy flavor that is perfect for pizza. The fennel sausage was both mildly spicy and full of that licorice-like flavor. Loved it!  $40",

It was  soggy and so bland that I had to add salt & pepper because there was no parmesan or red pepper flakes on the table. I asked for a side of red sauce to seek some improvement but ended up even more disappointed as it tasted like it was straight out of a metal can.    I also got the seasonal salad with peaches and white balsamic vinegar. The peaches were nowhere near ripe and it tasted like the salad was just drowned in straight olive oil. Nothing appealing or refreshing about this small $15 salad.   There was nobody in the restaurant but 5 servers and we still managed to have terrible service. There are far better places in the Valley for good pizza and Italian food.  Mora has this place beat hands down. We will not be returning to Pizzeria Bianco.",

My personal favorite is Rosa. The amount of cheese is just right. The pistachios and red onion work really well together. The aroma from the rosemary is amazing. Sonny Boy is my least favorite coz it's kinda too salty for my liking. Tips when ordering, don't order all your pizza at one go as the crust will get soggy if you don't eat it right away. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this place to pizza lovers when you visit Phoenix!",

Not only did they have pizzas there, they also had appetizers, salads and pastas.  A little bit of something for everyone.  Since we were a large party, we basically almost ordered 1 of everything on the menu and shared it family style.

I could eat everyone's edges, if they'd let me! I think if I saw someone leaving the end of the pizza crust, there could be an altercation!  We ordered the Sonny Boy, and the Pappadelle with Bolognese sauce. The homemade pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was thick and full of meat! We added wood roasted mushrooms,on our pizza! If you love mushrooms, it's a must! Absolutely delicious! Service is great, and the entrees come out SUPER FAST!

    "text": "I'm breaking my own rule of writing a review based off a one time visit, by reviewing Pizzeria Bianco, but there's good reason why. For one thing, I don't live in Phoenix, near Phoenix, or even in the same state. In fact, I live 2 time zones away and approximately a 4.5 hour plane ride. So sadly, I won't be returning anytime soon. And I say sadly, because Pizzeria Bianco serves up some of the best damn pizza I've ever had.   I've always been a firm believer in eating local and trying what a region is known for. AZ ain't exactly known for pizza so when my buddy suggested we get pizza in Phoenix, I was skeptical. But I did a little research and Pizzeria Bianco sounded legit.   How legit was it might you ask? Legit - with a capital L. I should also mention that I am only reviewing the pizza. I can't speak for their other Italian offerings, drinks, etc. But based on pizza alone, this was a five star experience all the way.  The perfect thin crust - chewy yet crunchy. A really nice sauce - not too sweet or bitter but a really nice balance. And cheese - not too much, not too little, not overpowering or too mild but just right. If there is a God, he is eating this caliber of pizza.   No, Chris Bianco did not hand make this pizza himself, but show me the man or lady who did, and I will give you the highest of high fives.   Yes, our waitress was a low talker and it was hard to understand her. And yes, a pizza here isn't cheap, but you pay for quality and quality is what you get.   I don't plan on visiting PHX again anytime soon, but you best believe that when I do, I will be running back here.",

We had an attentive waitress, but we got some awkward/weird vibes from her, like somewhat robotic and not as personable as we would have expected.  Nonetheless, here's a review of the food. Between 3 people, we shared:  -Spiedini (fontina wrapped in Prosciutto): 5/5, highly recommend, so delicious and comes with extra greens to eat it with  -Margherita pizza: 5/5, a True classic done well (and prob our favorite dish)  -Half Wise Guy, half Rosa pizza: 3/5 for both types, I respect their attempt to go unique, but we all unanimously agreed that the Rosa pizza tasted a bit like eating a pine tree (but not in a bad way!) and the Wise Guy tasted like smoked whiskey. Worth a try and both weren't bad, but also probably not my choice of pizza for the future.  -Pappardelle pasta: 4/5, pretty good pasta, a little bit muted in flavor  Overall, it was still an enjoyable meal and I'm glad we tried it. However, I'm reluctant to say it's a place I would regularly frequent or highly recommend to someone visiting Phoenix.",

I moved to El Paso, Texas, from NY about 10 years ago and even though we have great artesian pizza places, I have been hankering for that Brooklyn style pizza- so that was my quest while in Phoenix. I figured they are a large city and should have some... So, my friends that live out here told me there was no Brooklyn pizza to be found in Phoenix. I went onYelp to search and found this place. It had 4.5 stars with over 2300 reviews- this sounded like a sure bet- it may not be Brooklyn style but it must be delicious! We arrived at the location and walked down a short Path with other eateries and interesting type shops. We got to the pizza place and it looked like a place in Italy- very quaint and smelling amazing!!!! The menu had pastas and other meals in addition the pizza- but we were in a mission. We ordered two whit pie combinations on one pie (half on one side and half on the other). We were seated in the front eating space and could watch the pies being made and going into the wood burning oven. There is a dining room in the back but recommend making reservations for that space. There were family photos in frames on a wood bureau and there were expansive windows so you could look out onto the outdoor seating space. We also ordered drinks (hey take advantage of Uber) and the Prosecco was very good. The pie came out and it looked awesome. We took our first bites and were were so happy! The toppings and flavors were high end. The crust was cooked to have a slight char but it was still soft and foldable (like Brooklyn style); this is what I was looking for. They did not disappoint!!!! If you are having cravings for some great pizza, this is the place you need to try out!",

If you, too, are a pizza aficionado, you won't even really need to read more. But I want to write more because I so enjoyed my time here recently at a large group dinner.   We started off with 2 salads that had been veganized, a delicate fennel and citrus and a simple - but so fresh, it seemed right out of the garden  - mixed green variety. Combined with thick crusty slices of an artisanal country bread, I could have easily made a meal of this and a side of roasted mushrooms. But of course I didn't leave it at that. Despite the fact that I could have had pasta, also made vegan, I had to indulge in their specialty.  There is a marinara pizza on the menu that is already vegan, but I also added gaeta olives and the aforementioned buttery, sans butter, mushrooms. I can't even talk to you about how good this was. If you know me, I am prone to what I call \"food fugues\" and I ain't gonna lie, this happened here.   This may be all you need to know.  But I'll go on. The service is impeccable. They took such good care of our large group that I can only imagine how perfetto things would be with a friend or two. Even better, the dark, intimate atmosphere would lend itself so well to a date.",

I come from New Jersey where an Italian restaurant means you get delicious food and a lot of it.  Here, you have to keep ordering bread to fill yourself up so you can still leave feeling half-full after you're done.  Everyone in our party left the restaurant hungry after spending a huge amount of money and still not getting enough to eat.  Thankfully, there's a Blimpie's just around the corner (kidding).  Is the point of this restaurant to act as a showcase rather than actually feed people?  It's absolutely delicious food, there's just not a whole lot of it.  And you don't even get your own table with the communal seating.  Acoustics are awful, fuggedabout trying to talk to one another.  A family sat down close by, looked at the menu, got up and left.  Obviously they thought they were in a normal Italian restaurant instead of some foo foo culinary experiment.",

The flavors were right on. Would have been even better with a shave of Parmesan over the top. My dinner partner had the meatballs and polenta. The meatballs were super moist and tender. Tasted like a wonderful Italian grandmother would have made them. We also shared an order of the bread which was served with a tiny dish of olive oil, which was definitely not enough oil for 4 large slices of bread.   My only complaint was the service....our waiter was fabulous, but I felt like we were rushed through our meal. As soon as we had just started into our bread appetizer, our main courses came. And I had three waiters try to clear my plate before I was finished. I am going to chalk it up to opening week jitters. But please, if we are going to stick with a theme of fresh, seasonal Italian cooking and getting back to Italian dining basics, let us eat like we would in Italy. Give me some time to finish my food and enjoy it without rushing me to finish.   Now that I have that off my chest, I will most definitely be back. I am excited to see what kind of dishes end up on the permanent menu.",

My family was  joining me for dinner and were arriving a few minutes later. The place was not busy and tables were available and the hostess told me I had to wait?  The hostess told me I had to wait until my full party arrived.  She proceeded to seat a couple after me even though their full party wasn't present and when I asked why they were seated I was told \"they are investors in our company and eat here often\". ?!? She agreed to seat me after my inquiry and then I was ignored by the staff.  Not one server came by to ask if I would like to order a drink or an appetizer.  I finally had to go to the bar to order my own glass of wine.  The bartender was very accommodating and took care of me right away.  When the rest of my family arrived, we still had to wait another 10 minutes for a server to come and take our order.  My husband asked for a glass of diet coke, the server said we are out of this item and offered up regular coca cola. My son asked for a lemonade and was told \"we don't have any\".    We decided at that point it wasn't worth staying any longer other than to finish the glass of wine that I purchased.   The server staff gathered at the bar and started staring at us because we hadn't left since we had already paid the bill. We saw the hostess mouth to the servers \"I'm sorry\" and then looked at us.    Wow- that's Pizza Bianco's type of customer service?   With all the pizza locations that are within a 5 mile radius and they treat customers like this makes me wonder how long this place will be operating at this location.   Zero stars from me along with a very disappointed customer.",

    "text": "It has been a couple of weeks since we went here, but I still think fondly of our meal and the warmness and hospitality of Chris Bianco and his mother when we were there. My husband and I arrived around 5pm on a Saturday and there was no wait. We were seated at a table for six and were told that they seated family-style. Usually, that is no problem as my husband and I don't mind chatting with people, but this was a rare \"Date Night\" for us and we wanted some alone time. My husband asked the server if we could sit at the two-top over by the window and she said \"I will check.\" We never heard back from her. Other than that, we had no issues with this place during our visit, which was the first week it was open. We selected a variety of items from the menu and ate them as they came out.  The house-made mozzarella and wild arugula was absolutely fantastic, and we ate up every creamy and spicy bite quickly. The butternut squash ravioli was tender and sweet...oh, and Francesca's meatballs with polenta were heavenly. Light and flavorful...not a heavy brick of meat you can sometimes find at Italian eateries. But the star of the evening...in my opinion...was the gnocchi. It was amazing. Light, fluffy clouds of pasta. I washed it down my meal with Prosecco wine...a flavorful, sparkling wine. Mmmmm. We didn't leave room for dessert, but I hope to try one of the dishes in our next visit. While we were eating, Mr. Bianco's mother stopped by our table to see how we were doing. She was so sweet and told us she took a lot of pride in the food. She also gave me a wonderful compliment about how I looked like a classic beauty. (Maybe that is why I gave this review 5 stars instead of 4? ;)  Seriously, though...great place, no wait because we were there early, so that helped...and the food was light Italian...not heavy where you feel exhausted and tired after your meal and want to go straight to sleep.  As we were leaving, Chris Bianco chatted with my husband, who sees him at Lux a lot and he said he was also really excited about this new venture and if we had any ideas or suggestions, to let him know. I told him my fave italian meal was Broccoli Rabe with spicy Italian sausage. We'll see if it ever shows up on the menu!?  We will be back and can't wait!",

The atmosphere is simple but pleasant, with a view of the kitchen in the main room.  There is also seating outside, and they just expanded into an additional room.  Business must be good!",

We ended up sharing some pizza's, and had an appetizer of tomatoes and mozzerella cheese covered in oil, the homemade cheese was excellent.  I am a mozerella cheese lover so I thoroughly enjoyed that!  Our service was great, and to our luck they weren't that busy, so we stayed a couple of hours and updated our life events.

Until I found out they opened up a new location at the Town and Country shopping center right between Baby Kay's and Trader Joe.  I went in on an early Thursday afternoon, it was pretty empty as people are still working in the nearby businesses.  The restaurant only had a table occupied.  I was there with my g/f and we were seated by the windows by the patio.  We ordered a Rosa Pizza which has Red Onion , Parmesan Reggiano, Rosemary, and Pistachios.  We also ordered Pappardelle Paste that has Grass-Fed Beef Bolognese and Parmesan Reggiano.  Pizza was good, but the crust is too thin for my taste.  Pasta was good, but I think the price is way too high for such a small portion.  Overall, I give a 3-star for good food and good location.  The price is whole other story.  I still want to check-out the original restaurant in Downtown Phoenix.  Maybe then I would come back again and do another review.",

Had never had this type and they were excellent. Field green salad was small, very fresh and a little light on the dressing. Margherita pizza was great. Perfect crust, the sauce was like the best crushed tomatoes and the cheese was rich and not too salty. If Dante hadn't opened in Omaha five years ago, I would have been floored.

I dinned at The French Laundry for the first time 9 years ago and realized there existed a world of food out there about which I knew nothing.  Prep, plating but most off all the subtlety of flavor combinations.  From TFL my journey became more focused: per se, Daniel, Eleven Madison Park, Saison, Urasawa, Melisse, Providence, Orsa and Winston.  All of these places help one master the subtle delineations of flavor and texture.  Wine was a similar journey.  Gone are the days of oaky Cali Chardonnay and only giant alcohol bomb cabs.  I now appreciate the subtle differences of Burgundian appellations from Chablis to Beaujolais.  My food fellowship has  taught me to appreciate what Chris is attempting all the more. Source the best possible ingredients. Create subtle flavor and texture differences. Throw in a solid wine list sprinkled with a little white Burgundy and pink Provence. All of this to create something that is most certainly not for everyone. Not for every night. Not for every budget.  I've watched my favorite morph from a Sonny Boy and a Giant Nebbiolo to The Wise Guy and a Domaine Tempier Bandol Rose.  My advice:  Don't recommend Bianco to your friends. Don't tell them it's \"the best pizza\" ever.  Just leave it for the rest of us who get it.",

We had a very pleasant lunch experience.  Our server was prompt, and other members of the staff were present and friendly as well.  I love the look of the T&C location, very vintage chic.  We ordered The Wiseguy, and Sonny Boy, and both were fantastic!  We are big fans of The Parlor, and Bianco's definitely gave them a run for their money, just wish there was a bit more on the lunch menu.  Oh, and the peach crostada for dessert was warm, flaky, and not too sweet.",

Dinner was delicious! bread/butter - amazing appetizer - grilled zucchini, savory entree - it was a crepe type of dish with cheese and spinach in the center. the BEST fresh flavor. side of meatballs - cannot come to this place without having them!!! so tasty, lots of flavor.  the waitstaff was very attentive and one of the owners came to our table as well. she definitely gave us a \"we're at home feeling\" which had us feeling \"we love you nonna!\"  food was great + service was great = total experience was exceptional",

Pizzeria Bianco had some of the best pizza I've ever had, and I am not a pizza fan (my parents owned a pizzeria, so I'm all pizza-ed out for the most part). I had the margherita pizza, and it's the best I've had in a long time. Such a fluffy crust--just chewy enough, but still soft. Crisp, but doesn't cut your mouth. Todd was our server, and he was fast and attentive, but he knew when to give me and my friend space. Love this place!",

    "text": "If you look up gourmet pizza in the dictionary, Pizzeria Bianco's pizza choices would be staring back at you.  This was some of the tastiest pizza of it's kind that I've had in some time.  As a native of Chicago, I am an open minded pizza lover (I mean I, of course, am a bit biased when it comes to deep dish pizza) but I LOVE pizza and especially love trying different types of toppings, crusts and sausage.  Pizzeria Bianco was all it was cracked up to be (however, I would NOT wait hours to be seated as I've heard is how things go at the downtown location...it's not THAT awesome, lol!)  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is really casual and nice- especially on the patio on a nice 80 degree evening :-)  Will be visiting again and again!",

I would rate Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco as number one, but Chris's pizza is truly unique and very close to the being the best pizza in the U.S.  His pizza has a thin crust Napoleana style.  His careful selection and combination of ingredients and the use of pecan and mesquite wood for cooking adds another dimension to the pizza.  Great pizza!",

    "text": "Big disappointment..  Read what Nicole S wrote regarding the pizzas.  I agree with everything she said.  Bland boring pizza without much flavor.  The crust was floppy and super thin.  The wise guy tasted like it needed salt or something and the Margherita was dull and the only thing that gave it flavor was the basil leaves..  I think they push the wine because that might give the pizza some flavor.  I have wanted to try this place forever because it's always talked about but it was a huge disappointment.  The waiter didn't really have a personality and really didn't seem to care that when he asked how everything was we only said okay.  We didn't even want our leftovers and I have never not taken leftovers from a pizza place if there was any left!  If it was a little better, I would consider trying the other location but if it tastes anything like this I'd hate to wait for hours just to eat crappy pizza again..   2 stars because the pizza did come out quick . Also, we liked the patio however if you want a patio setting go across and eat at Grassroots.  It's 100x better.  If you want good thin crust pizza go to Base, LaGrande Orange, Johnnys, or Oreganos... My boyfriend read this review and said he wouldn't even give it 2 stars....",

    "text": "On a whim on Saturday evening, my husband and I decided to try our luck at getting a table at Pizzeria Bianco. We didn't have reservations, we just walked in on a Saturday night at dinner time. We didn't think we would really be able to be sat without a very long wait. We were originally told a 20 minute wait, but then the host said that if we wanted to, we could just sit at the bar, as it is full service, so we did that. We couldn't believe that we were sat right away!  The female bartender that was taking care of us was absolutely wonderful. She was being bombarded with drink orders from the servers and patrons at the bar, but never seemed stressed at all, and checked on us at frequent intervals.  Our pizzas were dropped off by the same guy that was at the host stand when we walked in, and he asked if we needed anything else, and within one minute, he brought us back the condiments we asked for, as well as a plate of bread and olive oil. The place was absolutely packed and crazy, but all of the staff maintained friendly attitudes and were very quick with everything.  Of course, our food and drinks were excellent, and we left stuffed! I'm sure this review will get buried under the hundreds of other reviews for Pizzeria Bianco, but I was just so incredibly pleased with the level of service that I received this past weekend and I wanted to pass along the compliment!",

    "text": "Go eat here now!  Perfectly blended flavors from local, organic, personally grown ingredients.   We had a wonderful lunch, and then an amazing chat with the owner.  My husband and I wandered in for a later lunch yesterday, no idea that this was *the* Pizzeria Bianco.   And so close to the Trader Joe's and new Whole Foods that we frequent.  We sat outside, and the courtyard is lovely.  A short but carefully chosen menu is all you need.  Since I was wary (I didn't know where I was!), I kept it safe with just a caprese salad (handmade mozzarella, tomato, basil and olive oil) with a glass of sparkling water.  My husband ordered the 'chicken salad' with fingerling potatoes and Maya's vegetables.   This chicken salad will change your entire mind about what chicken salad should be.  Not a big gloppy mess of mayo and old chicken - the chicken was amazing real chicken, little cubes of apple, subtle herbs mixed in.    When we were sitting and chatting after dinner, just getting the bill, not anxious to leave after such a lovely lunch in a sun-dappled spot, the waiter was joking with us about whether we liked everything (since we cleaned our plates).  As we were raving about the food - he motioned at a chef in an apron and said, \"this is Chris, it's his place.\"  That's Chris Bianco.  I had heard about his pizza's.  And I had heard about Bianco's passion for perfect ingredients (on a tour we took of the Queen Creek Olive Mill where they described how he had only certain olives crushed to make his own olive oil for his restaurants).  But in person it was even more.  Chris Bianco is a man with a real passion for making wonderful honest food.  He knows where each of his ingredients are coming from, and is always looking to improve.  He shared the story of this location (a real place of the heart for him), and his efforts to get the best ingredients.  He refused to take the credit for the amazing chicken salad, saying that he just put ingredients together, the real star was this well fed / well grown chicken, and he put much of the credit for flavor on the chicken farmer (I'm sorry I forgot the name! but just go here to eat, you'll get some!).     Every restaurant wants to be able to tell you some story to impress you with their local this or specially-imported that, but every detail here that won't even show up on the menu is looked after.   To give you one example, we caught Mr. Bianco just after he'd been having a long discussion about where to get salt - sea salt from Glendale AZ even.  But believe me, he can tell you why he gets the Prosciutto he gets from; where, why he's growing tomatoes in California and basil on the back porch of this very restaurant.  This location is where Chris Bianco comes to cook and create.  The dining room in the back is filled with personal items.  Many paintings on the wall are done by his father Leonard Bianco, the large table was specially made, and the rug under it came from his childhood home.  A real place of his heart.  The passion and heart shows in the food.  I missed out on the wine this time, but I was told they were carefully picked and a good price for what you're getting.  I will definitely be having one next time.  And while the chicken salad is now on the must have list, I guess we will have to finally try one of those pizzas too! :)",

We wandered over near a Trader Joe's and stumbled into Bianco's pizzeria...with no idea about the reputation (until I spotted someone taking a photo with the chef, Chris Bianco).  We must say that eating at Bianco's we had one of those rare meals of pure artistry that lingers in the memory.   I for one,  can still taste the pure flour and water paperthin crust (for those of you who have a thing for NYC handmade matza, you get the idea)..The tomato sauce on the margherita pizza  was perfect, perfect, perfect pure tomato sweetness with no sugary additions. As for the biancoverde white pizza ...the tang of the goat cheese, the subtle earthiness of the  olive oil,  the intense mineral green of the arugula...WOW! He has truly aimed for and hit that rare culinary sweet spot, where each ingredient can be identified for its individual quality, yet harmonizes in a complex wholeness. Pizza perfection! Definitely a 10!  Mr Bianco grows his own organic tomatoes, which are hand picked and steam peeled, He selects and mills his own wheat, and pulls his own mozzarella. He also is a wonderful down to earth Bronx boy who appears to love entertaining and educating his customers and staff.  Do not miss eating here! HANDS DOWN the best pizza I have ever had in my life-(including NYC where I've eaten some of the best in the past decades...)",

    "text": "That was then...this is NOW!  We're Chris Bianco fans...so I'm not surprised we like this new place.  I'd seen the mediocre reviews others have given and was surprised.  I'd called Pane Bianco earlier today to see what their hours were now and asked about the poor reviews at Italian Restaurant and learned that the management team and chef had been turned over in the past weeks, so I thought this would be a good time to try it out.  Glad we did!  First...the food was excellent.  People were complaining about small portions, but the two of us could barely finish the food we ordered.  The portions of the gnocchi and the Polpetone were huge!  Service was excellent too...we arrived early evening getting a table wasn't an issue.  I suspect that will change as people realize that they've listened to the feedback and changed things for the better.  Food.  We shared a nice peach, arugula, goat cheese and candied pecan salad...again, nice size with delicious and perfectly ripe peaches...tasty all around...not over-the-top, but very good.  We also shared two entrees - and these WERE over the top good!  Gnocchi that was large but very light and fluffy (best I've had since Venice!)...sauteed to a little crispy edge...and served with roasted pork.  It was succulent and delicious...very juicy and flavorful.  The other entree was \"polpetone\" which I'd never had before but it was a truly perfectly cooked light/softly roasted and slightly sweet meat loaf.  I make a kick-ass meat loaf and this rated right up there.  It was served with heavenly smoky-salty-tasty baked beans and sauteed escarole...the latter was a bit more \"ok\" but the rest of the dish rocked.  We ordered a side order of meatballs - I'm not a meatball fan but my partner is.  I thought they were ok...he thought they were very good and liked that the tomato sauce tasted like tomato!.  They were good...but the polpetone really was heavenly.  No dessert...to much other food!  We had a glass of prosecco each and we spent about $35/person before the tip.  Maybe it's just us...but we definitely felt like we got our money's worth.  It was classic Bianco...delicious food expertly prepared and served.  Worth the trip!",

We ordered the wiseguy (fennel sausage) and the one with the peppered salami.  It was lunchtime on a weekday, so it was not crowded.  Service was good, pizza was a was average.  We each ordered a pizza, which was too much food.  We could have split one and been just as happy.  Our bill, including tax and tip, was $52.  That's quite a bit for two pizzas (we only had water to drink).  Good, yes, but if we go back, we'll split one next time.  It was good, just nit the best pizza I've ever had.",

    "text": "When I heard that this place was owned by Pizzeria Bianco, I was kind of excited, but two lunches later, I've filed this away as just a bad idea. The food - at least the two sandwiches I tried - were okay, but just not anything special. Perhaps my expectations were high, both because of the pedigree and the excellent place that occupied that location just before, and that made for greater disappointment. But nothing can change the fact that the lunch menu  is extremely restricted - 3 salads, 3 sandwiches and a couple of pastas, from what I recall. The sandwiches were served on crusty bread. Now I'm a huge fan of crusty bread (I mean I even nodded in agreement during the scene in Ratatouille where the chef says a good bread talks to you), but that's what I want for my bruschettam antipasti plate or with an olive oil and grated cheese dip - for sandwiches I expect something easier to bite into without the risk of taking out the eye of my dining companions, a focaccia or ciabatta perhaps.  One can guarantee that you will not be walking away over-full. A guarantee that you'll be satisfied or wish to return is as close to impossible as getting a side of balsamic vinegar with your sandwich there. The good news perhaps is that there still is an excellent lunch alternative in Cyprus Pita Grill next to it, and should you, like I and my friends, still have an empty feeling after lunch, there's Yogurtology just  down the line.",

I have been a Bianco fan for decades and will continue enjoying Chris' restaurants if this one is any indication.  The friend I had dinner with is as picky an eater as I am, so we each had the same dish:  the eggplant spaetzle.   It was excellent.  Homey and well seasoned.   We confess to spying on other diners.  Not only did all of the other dishes look very nice, the comments we overheard were all enthusiastic.    The atmosphere was busy, but well managed.   It is a fun, funky trattoria, the kind of place you would find in an Italian village.   Well, almost.   I was delighted that some of my favorite servers from Pizzeria Bianco were serving here as well.   Chris must be doing something right to maintain such a loyal and competent staff for so long.",

God forbid my host doesn't have a vitamix, so I have to drive to random locations to get my fix. As per usual, I got my smoothie from whole foods and was satiated, as well as perplexed as to why I just bought a ten dollar smoothie and why I also got $180 worth of random items including bee pollen and nut cheese? Anyways, I walked to my car and noticed the sign for pizzeria bianco. I loaded my whole two bags into the trunk and went and found out its the same place as the original location that I heard people bang on about the whole time I was at ASU. I got the margherita, recommended by the friendly and accommodating Dave. After my first slice I was pleased that the pizza was not only tasty but didn't leave me feeling sick as would a slice from somewhere like hungry Howies or dominos. Hurray pizzeria bianco, you continue to please.",

WAIT: Rather than waiting for 3 hours, we walked in on a Friday evening for an early dinner (6:15pm) and were seated right away.  You really can't beat that!  FOOD:   -- Hand made mozzarella, $12 - It's everything you expect from a good caprese - great cheese, flavorful tomatoes, fresh basil, and just the right amount of olive oil.  A solid, but not particularly exciting dish. -- Margherita pizza with wood wood roasted mushrooms, $16 (for CC); Margherita pizza with prosciutto, $19 (for AC) - Both of these pizzas lived up to our expectations.  The crust was amazing - super thin and chewy with a touch of char.  The cheese was equally good, as was the fresh basil.  There was just the right amount of sauce, which wasn't overly sweet.  The mushrooms were fantastic, cut in quarters rather than thin slices with earthy, woody flavors.",

When we asked why the delay, they said their first attempt at the order was burnt. So we appreciate not being served burnt pizza, it was CRAZY that the Bianco staff were so out of touch.

We arrived 30 minutes before our reservation. So we hung out at the \"bar\" and had a drink each. I would have liked another beer but it took 10 minutes for the bartender to place them in front of us.    Bartender was a tall skinny Brunette. It was not spamming busy at 7. So I don't know why it took her so long.  I said thank you as she gave me the beer, got no response back.    We asked to have our tab transferred to our table which was now ready.  I said thank you and again she just turned away coldly.  Maybe bartending isn't for her.  With a bartender there's a certain expectation that you make people feel welcome and extend courtesies back.  Maybe a position as a extra on the walking dead, all you have to do is moan and groan..  We ordered the wise guy pizza (white).  Crust is thin like I love. Salty seasoning on the crust was awesome.  Sausage was very tender and packed with flavor.  They brought bread out, burnt at the tips just enough to get that smoke toasted flavor.  I asked for oil and balsamic to dip bread in...It's a must!  Also got a motzarella and basil with roasted peppers appetizer.  Drizzle oil and balsamic over these gems to blast the flavor into orbit.  Love this place with the exception off the wall flower working the bar.  Thank you for a great evening!",

    "text": "Prior to living in the great state of AZ, my wife and I used to come out to vacation here in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  A little over 4 years ago, during one of our visits, we decided to hit up Pizzeria Bianco down on Adams Ave.  I had waited years to try it out and when I finally got to try it, I was a bit disappointed.  (See review here,   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?hrid=bwzEu7e35wv532D4WMB6VA\">yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bi...</a> ).  I thought it was too expensive for what we got, plus it wasn't the heavenly pizza/experience that some people described it to be.  Fast forward 4 years, I live here now (AZ), and saw that Bianco has branched out and opened a spot over here on 20th Street.  I had my mind made up since last week that on my day off, I would head down and get a Margherita pizza.  That is exactly what I did today.  Would it be better than last time?  We shall see.........    I cruised down to the place and found a parking spot in the lot.  I had been down here a few weeks prior in order to go to Whole Foods.  Pizzeria Bianco is located behind Whole Foods and to the left a little bit (if you are looking at Whole Foods from 20th St).  I walked in and was immediately welcomed by a nice young fellow.  He asked if I wanted to sit inside or outside.  It was a nice, breezy day so I decided to sit outside.  They have a cool little patio which also lets you do some people watching if you so choose.  My waitress brought over a glass of water and I placed my order for a Margherita Pizza.  A few minutes later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was..........  Margherita Pizza ($15.00)-  This thing looked great!  6 slices of food porn!  The crust had a nice slight char to it, the cheese was melted perfectly, the crushed tomatoes and sauce were vibrant, and there were a couple of leaves of fresh basil  layered on top.  It smelled delicious, too!  Unfortunately, that was the highlight of this pizza...the look of it!  I picked up a slice and noticed that it was incredibly thin.  We are talking paper thin...literally!  I remembered from the first time I went to the OG location, my big beef was that the pizza was too thin.  Hey, I'm all about a thin crust pizza and actually prefer a thinner crust over any other style  This crust was so thin, you could pretty much see through the dough.  If you were ever a prisoner behind huge steel doors, this pizza still may have a chance to slide under the most minuscule opening of light.  I seriously don't know how this dough doesn't just disintegrate when you pick it up!  I tore each slice in half so that I could fold up the thin dough and eat it without having the cheese droop off.  The tomatoes, cheese and basil that they use are delicious!  The outer crust even had a nice chew to it and was my favorite part of the pizza.  That razor thin dough, turned me off though!  I could have EASILY eaten 2 pizzas just because of the thinness.    Overall, for $15.00, I wanted more. It was a $20.00 pizza after tax and tip.  The taste of the pizza was nice, fresh, and tasty,  but the value was/is horrible.  Not sure if I will be back.  I have 5 other pizza joints in Phoenix that I would frequent before here.  I guess all I can do is try his other spot (Pane Bianco) for pizza one evening.  If it's exactly like this and the Adams ave one, we may have just looked at strike 3 and struck out!  We shall see............",

The restaurant is located in a quaint shopping center and is not obnoxious with signage at all.  Unless you know where you are going you would miss it.  Host was friendly, but not overbearing.  When we called ahead she was extremely helpful.  Our server was nice, but a little quiet, and maybe could have used a little more sense of urgency, and enthusiasm about the menu.  The strong 5 star part of this experience was the food.  We had a couple appetizers.  One was a mozzarella dish and the other was cheese wrapped in prosciutto!!!  Both were just the right portion, and delicious.  My fiance and I both had pizzas, and I have never enjoyed eating the end of a slice as I did the beginning, and the wood fired mushrooms and fresh made cheese...WOW!!!  Highly recommend, don't understand some of the low reviews.",

    "text": "Let's get one thing straight: I LOVE me some Neapolitan-style pizza.  And when I say *love*, I mean obsessed with, read food blogs about, buy special equipment and ingredients to reproduce, plan trips around finding and consuming.  Here's what works in (what in my world is) the platonic ideal of a perfect pie: * Marshmallow-style charred crust, not oops-my-house-caught-fire-but-I-saved-this-pizza style charred crust.  When your chefs know what they're doing and your oven is perfect, you get a thin, yet pliable and not bitter, crust that resembles nothing so much as a carefully-toasted campfire marshmallow.  The crust separates the good effort pizzas from the magical ones. * Perfect sauce.  Not too much, not too little, not sweet. * Sparing, but beautiful, cheese. * One or two menu items that divert from classic and surprise you (my favorite pie in the universe has pickled jalapenos on it, but my second-favorite is a good old-fashioned margarita.)  Pizzeria Bianco: I'd give you four stars, but you're a victim of your own hype.  I've been told this is the best pizza in the country, and well it's solid and well-executed, I'm paying DC/New York prices for what is really just a solid, but unremarkable, pie.  Good sauce.  Good cheese.  Cracker-style crust: more New York than Naples, which is probably just a personal preference, but in any event for my taste too bitter to properly showcase your lovely ingredients.  I'd give you a pass on creativity if only your crust was perfect.  Pluses: this location is easy-to-locate and not crowded, and service was excellent. Good wine selection; would have liked to see one or two warm appetizers and a better-curated beer list.  Yep, Bianco, I'm being way too hard on you.  Blame good publicity paired with a \"yeah, I'd come here occasionally if it were in my neighborhood, but I wouldn't make a special trip\" experience.  You're good pizza; you're just not amazing pizza.",

We were a bit bummed about that as it was a nice afternoon. We were seated at a really small table in the back room. I don't understand why nice restaurants seat people at tables that barely hold any food.  The free and fresh bread that they give is really good. The texture and flavor is amazing. We ordered the mozzerella salad and the biancoverde pizza to share. The salad was fantastic. I liked the pizza but thought that it would have been better if the crust was a little more cooked in the middle of the pizza. Otherwise, it was quite good.  The server was nice and was attentive at first but we had to wait about 10 minutes to get her attention to get the check.  Overall, we like it and will be back to try more items on the menu!",

    "text": "Last night I took my family that was visiting from out of state to my favorite pizza spot.  Sadly, it was the first time that I had an experience that I would rate less than 4.5 stars.  OCD Version: Food: 3 stars Service: 1 star  Service: We had a reservation for our party of 8 and I was surprised to find that they were barely half full at this time.  Previous experiences at this location had at least a small wait during peak times.  We were seated promptly.  We placed our drink orders but I was disappointed that there was really nothing sweet to drink other than water for my seven year old who doesn't drink soda or caffeinated products.  It would be nice if they had juice or lemonade.  I stepped away from the table and when I returned, the drinks had come- but not mine.  The server did not return for another ten or so minutes and when I informed him I did not get my iced tea, he seemed to think I hadn't ordered anything. We placed our orders for three small plates, four pizzas and one pasta dish.The three appetizers came out at the same time and were all fine.  It took about 20 minutes more for the first two pizzas to arrive and the remaining two took another ten minutes.  The pasta dish was a no show but we didn't get a visit from our server for quite a while because he was speaking to a table in the corner for over ten minutes.  I flagged down another server to inquire about the missing pasta dish.  He intercepted our server who proceeded to RUN over to the POS system and feverishly pound something into it.  He returned to our table with a comment about that he's not sure why the pasta hasn't come out but he will go check on it.  Ten minutes later, the pasta arrived.  He continued to spend time at that other table the rest of the evening, never checking on how our food was.  Overall, the service was a display of willful neglect and the resulting unintended errors.  When it came time to pay, the check sat on our table for another ten minutes while he visited with the table in the corner and with the little ones we had in tow we wanted to get out of there.  I had to take the bill and credit card to the front of the house to have someone run the card.  Food that I sampled: SPIEDINI: tasty, albeit quite greasy.  I think that is hard to avoid given the ingredients.  MARINARA PIZZA: this was good but somehow not as tasty as it was in the past.  The sauce was good but the other ingredients were flat.  ROSA PIZZA: Typically my favorite pizza here.  Tonight, the flavor seemed off and all the pistacios were localized to one spot on the pie near the center. SPAGHETTI BIANCO DINAPOLI POMODORO.BASIL.PARMIGIANO REGGIANO: this was delicious as always.  A simple, yet wonderful dish.  All this was so disappointing after talking this place up to my family and sad that this service experience happened while Chris Bianco was in the house.  I am torn as to whether I will give what was my favorite restaurant in town another try anytime soon.",

We sat on the patio, with the great fall weather we're getting right now. WE started with this great antipasto plate that came with some coppa, a few pieces of parm, this awesome eggplant ragu, roasted potatoes with parm, chanterelles with celery and a great warm broccoli salad. Easily the best antipasto I've EVER had. I ordered the Paperdelle bolognese and wifey had a pizza with parm and arugula. Both dishes were awesome. I will say the pasta wasn't quite pappardelle, more like half of a lasagna noodle and a bit thick for my liking, but the flavors in the bolognese were fantastic. the pizza was also just awesome. I'll for sure come back to eat some awesome PB food with NO WAIT!!!",

    "text": "Mama Mia.  I hate giving this kind of review  to a place I hold dear.  Obviously operations haven't been ironed out in the front of the house or the back of the house.  I've been a fan and patron of Bianco since '06 when I was exiled here from San Francisco and Chicago.  I was living part time in both cities.  I got to know thin and deep dish crust pizzas.  I prefer thin. Unless it's Giordano's.  I digress.  I came with my uncle. Assuring him it was awesome pizza even thin crusted.    We ordered two mozzarella salads.  Good.  As I have always expected.  We arrived at 7pm.  Salads at 715.  Pizza, the \"wise guy\" fired at 727.  Didn't receive the pizza until 810.    My uncle ordered iced tea.  He didn't receive a refill from our server.  He politely set his empty iced tea glass to the side.  And then we waited.    This awesome waiter assistant/back waiter filled his iced tea.    Then our server came by.  Asking if we wanted any crushed pepper for our pizza and if we were excited.  :/. What?!  Obviously!  We had been waiting and she didn't even acknowledge our wait let alone fill one iced tea.  Then I had to call anyone who would make eye contact with us over to see exactly what was happening with the pizza we ordered.  Was it given to another table?  Was the temperature in the wood fire burning oven too low?  Why aren't we enjoying Chris Bianco's pizza yet?  She explained that the order is fired after salads are FINISHED on the table.  Be warned.  I wasn't.  Lord almighty.  Back of house and front of house has some work to be done.  Fire entrees when salads arrive.  Not after one finishes their salad.  I was given this explanation.  \"The oven is backed up right now.\"  This came from the hostess I had to wave at.  Understand, it's very horrible and rude to have to wave at any restaurant staff.  They are thinking a million things a second if they really care about their job.    Our waitress was lackluster at best.  She ignored us.  She was either embarassed the kitchen is going through changes( and going down) with new blood or she just really doesn't know how to talk to a table regarding a long time ticket.    Very disappointed.  I'll take out from now on after calling ahead.",

    "text": "I am NOT going to Review Pizzeria Bianco (which I finally got into, after four tries!)  as there is no way it could ever live up to the hype and it didn't for me.  That being said - DO NOT MISS THE BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX, part of The Bianco Braintrust!  This is a remarkable Restaurant to say the least. Slow or busy, the staff is excellent, the place simply and nicely decorated and the food quality very consistent.  I have had or shared most of the menu items, including two of the three Pizza offerings (each was delicious, with thin crust) and they have been unanimously delicious. A relatively short menu, but here are my favorite standouts:               Crunchy Brussel Sprouts Salad - is to die for! DO NOT MISS IT!               Market Salad - is excellent, but I can't NOT order the Brussel Sprouts Salad               Francesca's Meatballs - Excellent, as is the Marinara Sauce              Cavatelli (which I love) - might be the best ever!              Tangelo Chicken Involtino -  is quite fabulous and I seldom order chicken  The bread is excellent and here is NOTHING not to like that I have ordered. A couple of dishes, although good, were not as unique, as flavorful and as sumptuous as the ones above (which raise the bar relatily high!), yet still VERY GOOD.               The Pasta Fagiola is a little thick for my taste,  but great flavor.               The Grilled Asparagus, while very nice, was NOT as unique as other dishes  Had pretty much given up on excellent Italian Food in Phoenix, but this jewel has restored my \"Italian Cravings!\"",

    "text": "I have been here twice and feel like I can adequately express my opinion. I like it... As an initial note, you must love olive oil. And lots of it. Luckily I do.  I tried the rosa last time as well as some house made spaghetti with only olive oil and garlic by my request. I LOVED the pasta. Perfectly al dente and super flavorful - simple bliss. The rosa was tasty but you must really like the salty hard cheeses - very salty and oily but I am a sucker for pistachios!   This time  I got the wise guy -- much better pizza choice! The smokiness in the onions and mozzarella paired with the slightly spicy fennel sausage was delish, and the chewy crust was perfect.   The cons: it is more expensive than it should be -- feels more like LA prices (not a good thing). The other thing that I have actually really NOT liked about the camelback location is the ambiance in that \"annex\" room for lack of a better word. It is large and open and cold feeling. You feel like your conversation is echoing in everyone's ears and it was distractingly uncomfortable. Perhaps some partitions or something would help -- I don't know, but if you go, ask to sit in the front room, which is where I will be sitting next time.",

    "text": "We came to this plaza to eat at Baby Kay's to find out they were no longer there. As we tried to figure out what next, we walked by Pizzeria Bianco and was like, is that what I think it is???? We had no idea they opened another location and were thrilled there was no line. The weather was nice so we sat outside. My husband and I each ordered a cocktail. Mine was the mojito which was just okay. The antipasti we ordered as an app was amazing. Then again, we had just come from the gym and were starving! I stand by the amazing, though, although it should have included more cheese. It had some parmesan, copa, brocolini, eggplant, Yukon gold potatoes, mushrooms, and beets. Delicious. I ordered the white pizza with arugula. I enjoyed but it tasted as though lemon was squeezed over it. Lemon is not a flavor I like on anything including seafood and water. I could have done without that but still liked. My husband had the papparadelle. The pasta was thick (think lasagna) but tasty.   So, for a kids milk, 2 cocktails, antipasti, a pizza, and the pasta, the bill was $76! Yikes! Not for the faint of heart....",

    "text": "Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they expanded the restaurant. We were seated in the new room in the back; it was like being in a restored Tuscan farmhouse with all the candles, paintings, chandeliers, firewood, books and such. At our table, even though it was still light out (just after 5pm) they already had 2 candles lit, and along with fresh flowers and pepper grinder and salt, this shows how much pride the owner has in this restaurant.   FOOD: I think I had the best dish at the table, the pappardelle with bolognese. I think they seriously improved this dish, as this is the most authentic, with rich sauce; the best I have had in a long time. I just loved the thin sheets of obviously homemade pasta. The lasagna verde was also very good, but I think they should have just eliminated the red sauce and done more of a bechamel. I didn't care so much for the chicken involtini; it was a little dry, dense and tough, as if it was precooked and then reheated.  There was also a new sign indicating Pizzeria Bianco, probably because they now have a wood-burning pizza oven. However, I hope this isn't the same pizza that people wait over an hour for at their sister restaurant because I wasn't too impressed with it. We tried the margherita: the crust wasn't that thin or crispy on the bottom; sauce was great but cheese was scant and not very bubbly hot. Having lived in Rome, Italy I guess I was expecting that type of pizza so maybe this is supposed to be more like what you would find in Florence. However, the homemade bread and olive, brought to the table at the very beginning, is just amazing.  SERVICE: top notch, professional; our waiter was well-dressed (like all the other staff) and non-obtrusive. You can tell he timed everything accordingly, waiting for us to finish the appetizer, unlike other Phoenix restaurants where I have to wait to order my entree to avoid getting served too fast.  HIGHLIGHTS: ambience, simple fresh and high-quality ingredients, service. I will be back to get the spaghetti with an order of meatballs. I eyed them at another table and they looked amazing even from 20 feet away!",

    "text": "Although this Pizzeria Bianco is much bigger than their original, it doesn't taste the same! :(  I went with two friends and we ordered two pizzas, wine, coffee and dessert.   The pizzas: Margherita - This was good, it had fresh ingredients and was simple. To be honest, I think it's really difficult to mess up a Margherita pizza. Sonny Boy - This was okay, but for the non-sauce pizzas, I definitely like the other 2 much better.  The wine and coffees were good and great for keeping conversation flowing. ;)  We also got a piece of cake. Personally, I don't like any fruit flavors with my chocolate (this one had an orange rind/flavor on top), but my friends liked it a lot.  To be honest, I wouldn't come back to this one. The original is much better. I can taste the difference in the crust and how it comes out. I was a little disappointed in the food, but the service was great and MUCH faster than their original location.",

The large pizza had maybe three small pieces of sausage and way too many grilled onions.  There was a 40 min. wait so they told us to wait at their bar next door.  It was happy hour and the menu said white wines for $5, so I ordered the house chardonnay.  When I got my bill it was $28 for two chardonnay's.  When I inquired about the price I was told that the Chardonnay was not on Happy Hour and even though the menu listed Chardonnay's from $8 to $14 they only stocked one wine which cost $14/glass.  What trickery to make money.  They should have told me that the wines listed on their menu were not stocked.  Fraudulent practice.",

    "text": "I have purposely held off writing a review of this spot thinking that perhaps my four visits were anomalies and not the norm but after my last experience on Saturday I have decided that in fact that it just isn't going to get any better... so here we go. Yes the Rosa and the Sonny Boy are sublime. In fact there are a handful of things on the menu that I believe don't get any better.  But there enough things on the menu that are done equally as well or better elsewhere that they lose their first star and are down to 4.  Ambiance is actually nice.  In fact it is quaint, with the home like feel of the two rooms, resulting from what used to be the two restaurants in one concept that they thankfully abandoned. This location is far more roomy than their other venues, which is really appreciated, unless you are one of those people that doesn't mind squeezing around the door and straddling the seat to get into your allotted 2 sqft. Nice doesn't warrant a bump, so we are holding at 4 stars.  Service is what kills this location. Yes, I know you believe you are local food gods but refer to my first point... you are very good in some areas and lacking in others, so if you want to rate five stars then you are going to have to kill on service and well you do sort of, just not in the way that is good.  So once again, the meal took on a sort of combative feel and to quote Patton Oswalt's stand up that came later in the evening, \"I'm so pissed right now, but I can't wait to see how this all plays out.\"  As a customer, I shouldn't feel \"beholding\" to get a table at 5:10 p.m. on a Saturday.  When I walk in and you have a total of 4 tables, do you have to sit my party of five at the smallest four-top in the restaurant?  Should the waiter come to the table three times, blurt out some information and dash off to his other table without so much as asking for drink orders? When our party asked if we could move to one of the larger tables that might actually accommodate food for five people, is it required to hold an adhoc summit meeting in the corner, comprised of five wait staff, the GM, and the hostess all glaring at our table and whispering?  Hint: If you don't want people to know what you are saying, just move your bodies into the other room...  (Down .5 stars for invoking the spirit of a cold war peace talk)  Should the hostess come to speak at length to our table and condescendingly explain that ALL of the other tables are reserved so the larger four-tops aren't available because the parties are coming in at 6:45 and I'm assuming she didn't think our party could eat in under 1.5 hours?  After expressing that we could probably meet the time requirements for a larger table if someone were to actually take our order, we were ushered over to a different table with grand Downton ceremony. (Down 1 more star for tainting my favorite show and making this feel like we were a Make-A-Wish kid being granted their final request)  And then apparently we had been branded the \"trouble table\" because we were now under the care of the GM and experienced peripheral glances from the entire wait staff.   At least service picked up at this point.  We were able to place our order, which may have included more items but we knew we were under the gun and had to vacate the table before 6:45, so we stuck with simple and straight forward and quite frankly I think we all just wanted to eat and get out of there by that point.  Amazingly we had only been at the restaurant for fifteen minutes and we had gone through what seemed like a full month's worth of soap-opera drama and long staring pauses.  If only we had the appropriate soundtrack to fill out the backdrop...  Net result 2.5 stars.  The food came out quickly but considering the number of patrons and the simplicity of our order (four pizzas), this didn't seem like a Herculean effort.  The GM poked his head around the corner for a peek or hovered around the table at approximate four minute intervals, plates were whisked away at an alarming rate and at 6:08 p.m. we left the restaurant.  Fifty-eight minutes of some of the most uncomfortable dining experience possible.  So my fifth visit will be my last.  If you want CB's food, go to one of the two other venues in the city and pass on this one.  Or just go to one of the other local, less glorified, spots that are on par with his pizza and where you don't have to take on a submissive stance for the privilege of eating.  Hint:  You are honored by the presence of your customers and exist at their whim.  Not the other way around.  :(",

    "text": "Had seen this place while going to Trader Joe's but the nondescript name didn't  scream out \"eat here!\" Then we saw on Yelp that it was a Bianco restaurant and had to check it out. We could not have been more pleased.   Atmosphere: Show kitchen as you walk in, bar/lounge area in front, small patio to the left. Larger dining room in back w/ nice wallpaper & crown molding gives the place an older feel, which I like - not 2-year old strip mall motif.  Had dinner at the bar served by Lisa, Saw a \"Desert\" Mule on the cocktail menu but was a little leery about a Mule w/ Bourbon instead of vodka and something called St. Germain. Boy was I wrong! Turns out to be a concoction invented by Lisa. St Germain is an elderflower liqueur I had never tried before and combined w/ the bourbon, ginger beer, orange, cherries and sprinkle of cinnamon...WOW! One of the best cocktails I've ever had.  The food wowed as well. The olive oil that comes with the crusty bread is their own blend and is fabulous, light & nutty. Gnocchi and pork special was just that...special. And the pizza was what you would expect from (depending on the year), the owner of #1 to #3 pizza place in the country.  Not cheap but pretty reasonable for what you get actually, Two cocktails, app, bottle of wine, two entrees, dessert, two porto's & two espresso's, about $150 pre-tip.  I think I understand the brief name now. There must not have been enough room for DAMN GOOD ITALIAN RESTAURANT !",

    "text": "We have to set the record straight about what's original. Chris Bianco had his first wood fired oven in Town and Country on 20th st and Camelback. He was young and passionate and his pizza was sublime. I never really understood his move downtown but it worked out for him, at least in the fame department. We found it too difficult to be loyal followers at the Adams location with the long waits and lousy parking. The pizza was excellent, but the hype about it being \"the best\" was a distraction, and like all such titles is debatable and temporary. The operation has expanded to 2 eateries and returned to almost the same spot in Town and Country and   we think it's darned good. The service is attentive and the menu is appealing. We prefer it for a late lunch outside, but that might just be an age factor. I miss the good old days listening to Chris extoll the virtues of fresh mozz to my culinary son,but today's version is still solid fare",

We asked her for wine recommendations and she recommended the most expensive bottles on the list, sorry but no. Then, when it came time to pay the waitress overcharged us (she rang in beer instead of espresso, really?) and then when we got the corrected bill, we all paid and went home. The next morning, I looked at my bank statement and realized I was over charged by THIRTY DOLLARS. I immediately went into the restaurant and the manager said he would void the charge and charge us the correct amount. Well, the sneaky guy decided to charge me $64.10 instead of $58.10. Even WITH the correct receipt he still managed to over charge me. What a f-ing joke. Learn some goddamn customer service.   I will NEVER go to Bianco ever again.",

    "text": "Soft opening, so take it with a perfect grain of salt.  As much as it is a homecoming for Bianco, being back at T&C is also a re-awakening it seems. A sort of do-over. This is the stuff we always wanted to see Christopher do. As the Bianco Realm expands here and overseas, it's clear that he is energized, yet still as himself as ever.  FOOD We had...  Grilled head-on white shrimp with white beans:  As good as it gets. Simple, delicious, layers of flavor, but you taste every bean. And suck those shrimp heads! They are awesome. For me, as basic as it was, this was the stand-out dish.  Fennel and orange salad: Refreshing and simple. But good contrast. Great bite between dishes to refresh. Keep one around.  Pork ragu over Fusilli: Hearty, carrot-sweet, firm noodles, rustic chunky pork gravy. This is so up my alley.  Burnt-butter fried sage sauce spinach/ricotta ravioli: good lord.  Seafood stew: these things almost alway look the same. And this is no exception in the looks department. The difference is, where you usually get the same old tomato broth with a bunch of chewy crustaceans and throw-away whitefish... here you get tender bits of delicious sea creatures, each with their own flavor. All in a broth that actually tastes like seafood, not just salty tomato soup. Only suggestion: a big chunk of rustic Marco Bianco bread on the side to sop up all the delicious broth!  Flourless chocolate cake thing with lightly whipped cream: I'm not a dessert guy, so my wife and I split one. We shouldn't have split just one.  OVERALL Friendly, confident, competent, attentive service. Pretty easy to do on an early soft opening night. We'll see how they do when they're in the weeds. But this crew seems like they're on it, and ready.  The food is what you dream of having if a friend took you to a chef's house in the Italian countryside and said: \"We're gonna eat what his family eats when they get together and cook simple, fresh, amazing real food.\" This is so welcome in Phoenix. And it would be welcome anywhere, if we lived there :-)  As the menu will keep changing, we're looking forward to exploring over the coming years. Bravo Christopher (and Erin and Stevey and Claudio and Marco and Sergio and Crew)!",

    "text": "Trattoria Bianco is back to one restaurant that serves both pizza and other delights.  This review is not so much about the food or the service--but an attitude.    I did a large party of 12 on a Friday night--I attempted to make the reservation almost a month ago not by calling but actually by going to the restaurant.  At the time I thought we were going to be a party of 16--if you are over the magic number of 15--you have to do a pre planned meal and it must be at least $30 per person--I had offered to do a pre planned menu--but did not want to be at a $30 per person price point--dealing with all the machinations around the rules--was difficult at best--and made me almost walk away and find someplace else.  Anyway as it turns out--we were a party of 12--6 or 7 of us got there early and they would not seat us until all the party was there -- one of my family members (male) asked to see the manager and it was only through this second intervention-that  we were able to sit at our table at 5:45 instead of 6.    I love this restaurant--I love the  food as did everyone in the party.  Our server was terrific.  Our bill was very close to $500 and for that--it would be so much nicer to have felt that we were welcomed instead of having all these little rules and machinations.  I know if we had not been there --that they would have filled the table, I get that, but I guess I want to feel this is my neighborhood restaurant where I can bring friends and family for a celebration or just a great evening and be welcomed to enjoy the hospitality of Chris Bianco's restaurant.  Instead the evening was colored by the attitude that came from the person at the door and the manager--who made a parting shot at my family member about the favor they had done us by seating the party 15 minutes early. I guess it just makes me sad.",

I am glad I tried it, but if i ever find myself in Phoenix I am not going here and not recommending it to anyone either.",

    "text": "Italian Restaurant, the generically named eatery from James Beard Award-winner Chris Bianco, is scheduled to open its doors Monday, Jan. 16, 4 o'clock, in the Town and Country Shopping Center, around the corner from Trader Joes. They were right on time.  Chef Claudio, the mercurial boss of the kitchen Italian Restaurant is outside his door to meet and greet just a few folks before he begins his voodoo that he does so well. He shakes my hand and we introduce.  The Tuscany dining room is an old world stage. Fired candlesticks light the walls. Framed pieces of art hang with pride. There is an energy about, that certainly is a tribute to mama, and the \"food we grew up with.\"  I sit at the bar as a gentleman is finishing \"home movies\" of the guest arriving. Tom becomes my server. He is wearing a Claddagh ring. His is in the marriage position. I have one too, I wear mine in the prowling position.   I order a drink and Tom brings me red wine from Dos Cabezas Wineworks in glassware you would see at the Italian family table. As a footnote I have been to a blessing of the harvest at this Southern Arizona Vineyard. These Festivals are surreal. Mine included monsoon storms in the distance while walking in the vineyard at night with my date. You can taste the love that goes in this table wine.   First on the menu is antipasti. I decide to have Pecorino Di Fossa. 6. This is a hard, flaky sheep's milk cheese that you must hold on your tongue resisting to bite for as long as you can. A cheese that has been aged in caves for four months, indeed subterranean holes that occur naturally in the Northern Italian landscape of this area, and they are the source of Pecorino di Fossa's complex flavor and aroma.  It is time for Chef Claudio to fire my Organic Kamut Grain Spaghetti. 14. Chef has been making pasta longer than anything else, so the choice is simple. Server Sidney announces spaghetti and serves me from the left. I look over to her and with the sparkle in her eyes and lovely smile, I'm shot through the heart.  I have an order of Pane Bianco bread to mop my sauce and work my pasta. I taste  slight heat in the sauce from Contorni Peppers. The dish is just perfect.  I finish with a cafe solo in a demitasse cup and a cube of sugar on a demi spoon.  Bottom line I spent 48 dollars for two glasses of wine, cheese and cherries, spaghetti and bread, and a cup of espresso.   And one last note, tell your server how long to wait to fire your entree, if your in a rush say so, if you want to slow it down to enjoy your experience with your date, say it. And the smaller portions are in line with rising high quality organic ingredient costs.",

So how was it this time, poor service, average food, messed up our bill from another table, asked for no dressing on the salad ( yeah I know ... difficult Britany) when the salad came our with dressing the server said \" well it's only light dressing\" expecting me to accept it. I sent it back but she stomped off with a sour muzzle of a face. Look, I get it, this place has told everyone to kiss its ass for years,, but realistically times have moved on.

I haven't had the pleasure of eating at the original Downtown location, which some yelpers have claimed is better. So I have nothing to compare this location too, but it was excellent and definitely better than any pizza I've had in California.  I was able to try three, margherita, biancoverde, and rosa. Loved the margherita, but the rosa was my favorite. The bianco verde was ok, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  It was almost as good as the pizza I had in Naples. Almost.  One day I hope to return and eat at the original location.",

    "text": "I can't fathom why Pizzeria Bianco does not have a better average rating. We dined on a Saturday night and had a pleasant experience as always. We started out with the antipasti. The cheeses on the board were okay - I've definitely had better. However, everything else was delicious. The broccoli, butternut squash and brussel sprouts were seasoned well. The prosciutto was good. I had the gnocchi and it was AMAZING. It was cooked perfectly. The pork with the gnocchi was tender and tasty. My boyfriend had one of the main dishes that consisted of beef and kidney beans. He unfortunately did not like it at all. It was bland and the presentation was terrible. Our server was great and so was the ambiance. I definitely feel like Pizzeria Bianco is a place you would go to for amazing pizza and pasta. Everything else on the menu is mediocre.",

    "text": "After many years of wanting  to try his pizza, finally got to the location at Camelback. I only gave it three stars mainly based on the high price for the pizza. I'll break it down by Crust, sauce and toppings. Crust - Very good, nice char to it, light and pillowy. Red sauce -  very tasty tomatoes, a bit on the chunky side and a little too much on the Margherita which made some of the slices flop. White pizza- good blend of oil olive and rosemary on the Rosa, loved he Pistachio and Parmesan cheese. The Wiseguy pizza had flavorful onion and smoked mozzarella. The sausage was also tasty. All said and done, the pizza is very good. Very comparable to La Piazza iL Forno in downtown Glendale but the high price is a turnoff in regards to being a routine place to dine at.",

    "text": "My husband and I were meeting our friends here for lunch on a Monday afternoon, we made a special detour before going to the airport because we'd heard the food was so good.   We walked to the host station and the man working behind the bar said he would be with us in a minute. A second employee approached us and offered to seat us. We explained that we were meeting a group of people that were already seated in the dining area. The second employee told us that we could join our friends. As we were approaching our friends' table, the first employee told us that he would not seat us at a table, they were too busy, and no one would be able to wait on us. We explained that the group we were meeting was already seated, and we would like to join them. He replied, \"well, good luck with that, the table is full.\" And walked away.   We were pretty disappointed to be treated with rudeness and sarcasm within the first two minutes of entering the establishment, it was a bad first impression. Our friends stayed and ate lunch. They said the food was good, but the server seemed put out that he had to wait on them. Since we were not allowed to join the friends we were trying to have lunch with, we went to Grassroots, the restaurant across the street.   Overall this was a bummer of an experience.",

    "text": "My fascination with Pizzeria Bianco originally stems from a late night visit to the downtown location about 8 years ago in Heritage Square. Back then, things operated a little differently. All pies were exclusively made by Chris Bianco himself, which clearly showed that quality and consistency were two concepts that this establishment greatly emphasized. Watching Chris work his magic and listening to him talk revealed just how passionate the guy is about his food. After getting my first taste, I've been hooked ever since.  Things are a little different now. While Chris can often still be seen in the kitchen or around his various restaurants, the pizza making process is now shared with his kitchen staff. Thanks to his expansion, wait times are now minimal. But anyone who fears that there would be a drop in quality can rest easy. The pizzas are just as great as they were back in the day. Fresh ingredients and perfectly charred crust that's bursting with flavor, Bianco's pies easily set the golden standard for what good pizza truly is.  The Town and Country location is particularly special because of its expanded menu. In addition to the pizzas, you can choose from a variety of pastas, which are all made in house. The bread, baked by Chris' brother, Marco, and served with olive oil, is hands-down the best bread I've ever tasted. Again, there's no need to drown this stuff in cheese or garlic. Its flavor stands on its own and is an essential starter to any pizza or pasta dish.  As for their pizzas, use a Margherita as a baseline and work your way up the Rosa, which is the most unique pie on the menu and one of my personal favorites. A good pizza is all about balance. One where you can taste all of the ingredients and be able to appreciate how they compliment each other. In a world where pizza joints drown their pies in cheese or shamefully pile on a mountain of different meats, these pizzas thrive on their simplicity. With six pies to choose from and an occasional market pizza, there's no need for anything else.   Admittedly, their desserts are kind of hit and miss. Bianco's traditional array of sweet dishes are all passable, but if you come on Tuesday nights, there's a good chance that Chris's mother, Francesca, takes things up a notch with one of her homemade specialties. If it's a spongecake night, then everything else on the dessert menu suddenly becomes irrelevant.    They also offer various seasonal features, including an amazing Tres Leches cake, which has been a \"seasonal feature\" for two years now. Maybe it's an inside joke since Arizona doesn't have seasons?   Service has always been decent, although somewhat robotic. The clientele is a mix of young and old. It's a great date place where you'll never feel out of place or uncomfortable.  We go here about once a month, whether it be trying new foods or revisiting old favorites. If you haven't already figured it out, it's my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix.   I give it my highest recommendation!",

It's still very good, but there are other places in Phoenix that I enjoy more. I will come back to Bianco in a heartbeat because of the excellent bread, pasta and specials offered each night.  I particularly love this location because of the decor. You feel like you're in someone's beautiful, shabby chic living room. The low lighting and candles make dinner feel like a special occasion.   During our last visit, we had some incredible gnocchi with lobster mushrooms. The gnocchi was the best I've had even better than what I've eaten in Italy. I could have eaten it plain.My husband stays away from gluten so he got the lamb belly special. During our last visit, he wasn't that happy with his chicken dish, but the lamb really made up for it. He loved every morsel of meat and enjoyed the beans and greens on the side. Bianco also has a nice wine list, and they serve their reds at cellar temperature which is appreciated during the hot summer months.  I haven't had dessert here in a long time, but I would make it a point to come on Tuesdays to get some of Francesca's offerings. They look amazing on Instagram!",

Mozzarella Appetizer - The mozzarella was soft and buttery.  It was great.  The peppers were very good too.  I would order it again. Romaine Salad - It's a take on the Caesar Salad.  Excellent.  I would order it again. Sonny Boy - My favorite of the 3 from the night. Rosa - No sauce.  Parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella.  And a pistachio topping.  It was very good.  The parmesan was sharp and had a great taste to it, but it was a little too much for me.   Margherita - You can't go wrong here.  It was excellent and would definitely order it again.",

So we decided to add it to our personal \"must try\" list.  We had a spontaneous date night and made Pizzeria Bianco our destination. And it was one of the best date night decisions we've ever made, seriously.  The pizza we shared was the Bianco Verde.  A simple, yet incredibly flavorful pizza! It tasted so authentic, that when we took a bite it felt like we were transported to Italy.  Usually when we're hungry we inhale our food, but this time around we wanted to savor each bite.  We've eaten all kinds of pizza from pizzerias from New York, Chicago, etc. This may have been the best pizza we've tasted... or at least top 2!  The atmosphere is small, cute and charming! Service is really quick and great. Perfect for a date, dinner with friends or family.  I know this isn't the original location, but... I'm actually really surprised this location doesn't have at least 4-5 stars!   5 stars all around! If you live or are visiting Phoenix, make sure to visit Pizzeria Bianco at least once! Your tastebuds and tummy will smile and thank you. It's the type of pizza that you think about after you've got the check, paid, walked to your car, and are back home - wishing you had leftovers.  We'll definitely be back to try more!!",

I can bring friends and family here without having to piece together a meal from appetizers, sides and salads. As to the pizza itself - it really does live up to the hype. The tomatoes seem like they've just been picked at the peak of the season. The crust is light and delicate. It's perfect. And I have never had bad service at PB. It's consistently great on all fronts. And I love that I rarely have to wait for a table since they are open for lunch.",

    "text": "The Chef/Owner Chris Bianco is a James Beard Award Wining Chef for his Pizza. The Pizza here is sort of Neapolitan in style with a blistered charred crust and a wet middle. The dough is made from local heirloom grains that are ground locally. The Italian Style Tomatoes are specially grown in California for the Chef and the Cheese is hand Pulled in a Bianco Restaurant. Many Celebrities, Publications and TV Shows all claim that the Bianco Pizzas are the best in the country. I have tried the pizzas a number of times but not at this location.  I've been to this restaurant a number of times and have had many different experiences here. The majority of times were outstanding but I've also been here for the rare not so great too. This restaurant opened as Italian Restaurant with a more involved menu and latter became two restaurants - Pizzeria Bianco and Trattoria Bianco. (front room pizza and back room pasta)   These days this restaurant is Pizzeria Bianco. This is a casual Italian Restaurant that looks like it's been here forever. The menu is limited (these days) They offer a few salads, a couple sandwiches, a couple fresh made pastas and the famous pizzas.  For this visit I had the chicken salad. My plate contained simple dressed local greens, really great pulled white and dark Two Wash Ranch Chicken salad (studded with celery and apples) and scrumptious Creamer Potato salad. The chicken was so tender, moist and flavorful. This is the same chicken that I had a Binkley's and other high end restaurants. It's outstanding and the salad was delicious. The potato salad was sweet but not too sweet and mustardy. It seemed like it was made with fresh made bread and butter pickles, fresh made whole grain mustard and these really creamy fingerling like potatoes. The potato salad was also outstanding.  My husband had the meatball sandwich. It was good and served on great crusty bread but not like meatballs he cherishes most.  The Italian Ice is not to be missed here. We were planing on only sharing one but got two. The Nutmeg Italian Ice is OFF THE CHARTS! Who Knew you can make something so great with nutmeg as the staring roll. The Italian Ices are different and are slightly creamy. The texture and the flavor is just remarkable. The Chocolate is excellent too but I can't stop thinking about the nutmeg. On my visit They gave two generously sized shortbread cookies that melted in the mouth.  While I don't feel a solid 5 stars here I have to give a 5 for the best Chicken Salad, Potato Salad and Italian Ice in Metro Phoenix.   The pizza for sure is quality but if it's the best is for you to decide.  4.5 Stars rounded up for the attention to quality and taste! This is how I feel this time hope I feel the same next time.",

    "text": "So...it has been three years since I have eaten here. I have heard all the hype about how great this restaurant is since my last visit. We went with friends and found the dining room is inviting. When you walk into the back dining area it feels like you are in someone s dining room. It is very inviting. The Caprese salad was delicious. The tomatoes actually tasted like tomatoes back east. The mozzarella had a lot of flavor. We were told they make their own. My friend ordered the chicken dish with fingerling potatoes. She said it had good flavor but there was very little chicken, mostly potatoes. The Pasta wth meat and bolognese sauce had good flavor but was a small amount of pasta. I ordered the Wise Guy pizza with sausage and cheese but was told by the waiter that there was no marinara sauce on it? HUH? So he recommended the margarita pizza and add sausage for an extra charge. The pizza had very little sausage and maybe a few tablespoons of cheese. The crust was overcooked on the edges but the center was soggy.   The prices are HIGH . Really,  one pizza for $25? I thought all the prices were high. The service last time was good. this time, fair, saw the waiter once. My drink was never refilled and no one ever checked on us.   This is strictly my opinion and I know many people love this place but frankly this place needs some work. As I previously stated, The Parlor right across the street is so much better. Obviously Phoenicians like to pay BIG prices for dough with sauce and little else. I won't be back.",

But Pizzeria Bianco... now they are different.  I was blown away by everything with the pizza.  It held together, delicious cheese, toppings, and crust.  I had no expectations other than low ones coming here, and seeing other reviews I see that it was rated the best pizza in the whole USA.  That may be a bit much, but it would at the very least be in the running for the best pizza in Arizona and maybe the Southwest (AZ, NV, NM).    As I said before, I am not a huge fan of this type of pizza, I usually avoid it, but I will definitely come back to this location as I was pleasantly surprised.  As a big fan of pizza... possibly a connoisseur, I definitely recommend coming here.  The interior wasn't anything special and the seats weren't the most comfortable, as everything in the place is pretty old, but who cares, you're coming for the pizza!",

The toppings were a joke and when I mentioned I couldn't taste the garlic she begrudgingly brought enough strong RAW garlic to choke a horse! We ordered salads that were way overpriced and included greens, vinaigrette, and a few olives. Wow that salad should have been a fraction of what they charge!!!

I do know that in general it's hard for me to be impressed by a pasta/pizza place.   We came to this location right at 11:00am (when they open) on a Sunday. Service was great. The decor is nice and you can see them making your pizza in the oven.   We ordered a half and half pizza of margherita and rosa (which had red onions, parmesan, rosemary and pistachios), and the pappardelle pasta (beef bolognese and parmigiano reggiano). They also gave us a small bowl of olives (in a tasty marinade!) and some \"bread sticks\" (which was pretty much their crust on their pizza).   I enjoyed the pizza, but I didn't think it was AMAZING though I could tell the ingredients they use are very high quality and fresh. You can't go wrong with a margherita pizza so I enjoyed that. I love tomato sauce on pizza though (the more the better) so I wasn't a fan of the Rosa though the boyfriend enjoyed it. He actually said the bread sticks were the star of the meal! The pasta as well was good but not amazing. The pappardelle noodles were great, but the sauce was a little oily for my taste.   I'm glad I got to give this place a try and would be willing to go again if other people wanted to check it out (and we could get a bunch of other dishes to share).",

The customer service is great really attentive, besides a few people who seem just a smidge snooty. The chicken salad we had was very good besides the dressing on the greens bit to heavy on acid makes the face pucker. The rest if the dish was very tasty. We had the sonny boy pizza. It was underwhelming. We appreciate the brick oven however ours was actually burnt and the flavor of burn came through a bit to much on the end of the taste. I had a glass of wine that I like however I could buy the whole bottle for what the glass cost me that's not necessary.

    "text": "The reviews of PB at the T&C Center look pretty mixed. Which I understand, since I myself have had mixed experiences here over the past year or so. Been here about 10 times total: happy hour side, fine dining side and take out.  THE GOOD- -Good to great ingredients used for their dishes. Obviously this place is most famous for its pizza. And I agree, it is frequently tasty. At times delicious...at other times just good...sometimes just-OK. It depends: did they burn the crust? Did they ration the cheese/sauce/toppings properly? If all is done well here, it's quite good. Not THE BEST...but nonetheless very delish.  -Homemade pastas; love it!  -Really like the decor in the fine dining room. (Can live without the bumpkins who chow on the fine dining side in cargo shorts and poopy sandals, though.) The happy hour side is a little cramped, but that's fine...it's what you'd get in the city... or Milan... or anywhere crowded.   -The bussers: honestly I think the bussers here are sometimes better than the servers. They are on top of water & bread re-fills; and dirty plate takeaways. Very efficient.  -Parking: plenty on all sides of the T&C Center, chief.  THE MEH- -The menu is small and some of the items offered are less-than-inspired. Frequently the salads are lazy. Like, they are **halfway** to being complete salads. STOP SERVING mixed greens + olives + parmesan and calling it a \"salad\". Maybe this passes for something in Torino...but in !!AMURICA!!, we demand more ingredients, paisan!  THE NOT-SO-GOOD- Some of the servers are GREAT. Some of the servers are just Cute But Don't Know A Lot About Food. We had such a gal on our last visit, which was a good meal. But when you don't know what you're serving, it causes problems. For example, Cutie Gal recommended the \"key lime pie\" for dessert, saying it's one of the best items on the dessert menu. NOT. First of all, the \"pie\" was actually a \"tart\", which is MUCH different. Plus, it was 97% citrus and 3% sugar, i.e. not suitable to eat and certainly not a dessert. We sent it back. The menu here isn't that big - I'd want the servers to at least be familiar with it.  In all, a flawed restaurant, yes. But usually good service, nice atmosphere and quality dishes. Through trial-and-error, you'll learn the better items on the menu and better times to visit. A little pricey, but a solid, good experience on most nights.",

It has a great texture; soft yet lightly charred and crisp on the bottom.  Something most pizza joints on the west coast can't seem to get right.

I ordered the 1/2 wiseguy and the other 1/2 biancoverde. I did not care at all for the biancoverde, very bitter parmesan and the flavors just didn't mesh for me. The wiseguy was really flavorful, the sausage and carmelized onions blended really well. The problem for the 2 star revue, the crust was BURNT!!! FOR ME IF YOU CHARCOAL THE CRUST YOU KILL THE FLAVOR OF THE PIZZA.  All you taste is the burnt flavor of dough. I did address this issue with my server, her reply\" because it is woodfire oven that is how the pizza comes out, if you are use to a brick oven the flavor will be different\" . Ok just for the record I have had pizza from all over, cooked in various ovens. It is not supposed to be burnt, no matter what oven you cook it in. Funny thing was the couple next to me got a pizza and guess what ?? It wasn't burnt, crazy thing came out of the same oven!!!! So for the lack of customer service and the burnt crust it is a 2 for me. Especially for the price you would expect a great pizza!!!!",

The ambiance for starters really made the place feel cozy, and was full of eclectic vintage decor.  The service was outstanding suggesting several wonderful plates all of which were equally fantastic.  The food tasted fresh, all the portions were perfect, and I found the prices to be very fair.  We had a wonderful time and even got to meet Chris Bianco.  I would highly recommend this wonderful place to anyone looking for a wonderful meal with the family to a romantic quaint date with your significant other.  Thanks Pizzeria Bianco for a great experience!",

    "text": "I'll admit it. I can be quite the \"pizza-holic\" at times. And it just so happened that I was trying quite a few pies during my Phoenix trip last week. Fortunately, I was able to cap it all off with a pilgrimage to one of the greatest pizzerias in America: Pizzeria Bianco.  Of course, we had to wait a while for a table. But when we're talking about pizzas coming directly from the brick oven and made with fresh quality ingredients, the wait is worth it!  Our party tried the Biancoverde, Margherita, Rosa, & Wiseguy Pizzas along with the Tomato & Mozzarella Antipasti Plate. And my goodness, the mozzarella was super creamy! And my goodness, the pizzas! The Rosa blew me away, and I'm not a big onion person. The Margherita definitely met my standards for that classic zesty goodness. And the Biancoverde was a pleasant surprise with a nice, spicy kick from the fresh arugula.  I didn't try the Wiseguy, but the carnivores in our party were somewhat underwhelmed by the fennel sausage. Other than that, no one was really disappointed by Bianco. Oh, and I very much enjoyed my Prosecco cocktail!  All in all, I was quite pleased with what I found and what I tasted at the original Pizzeria Bianco. And I now know why this seemingly humble spot tucked away in a strip mall was won so many culinary awards. It's definitely a \"must eat\" in PHX!",

However, when I learned they had opened another restaurant right around the corner from the office, I was there at 11:15 am the next day and was able to be seated immediately.  My review is pretty simple: this place totally lives up to the ridiculous hype.  The pizza (Sonny Boy) was amazing, as was the Market Salad (this one had arugula, peaches, walnuts, goat cheese).

There weren't any signs telling you that it was located there so I just happened upon it with some help from great Yelp friends. With all the word of mouth I'd. Heard about this place I was excited to try it.    We met some friends there around six and didn't have a wait to be seated. Being seated at the only round white table there and the short chairs made me feel like I was eating at the little kids table at the family holiday dinners I had as a kid.  The place itself was a little small but they make good use of their space.  The place felt cozy and like it was your second home, with a few unknown strangers dining with you.   Our table though was located a little too close to the door and wood fired oven.    The wait staff was very friendly and answered all questions promptly. She was even able to provide a recommendation on menu choices.  I really like it when the wait staff knows their menu. Although we had to request the bread and oil. The pizza was your typical thin crust fire baked pizza. I ordered the rosa pizza which had onions and pistachios. A very yummy and interesting combination.  The only downside to the evening was the menu itself. There are two pages devoted to wine beer and spirits but only one for food options. There were only 6 pizza options, 2 pasta choices and a few salad options.",

Before I talk about the food we actually ordered, let's talk about the bread course - or more specifically, the olive oil. I am not ashamed to say that after drenching all of the bread (which was also really good) in olive oil, I proceeded to wipe the bowl clean with my finger. Not overly cultured, I know, but absolutely necessary. The tomato undertones in the EVOO made it hard to resist.  We were hungry, having not eaten for the majority of the day, so after polishing off our two plates of bread, we proceeded to dig into our two pizzas - the Sonny Boy, which had red sauce, salami, olives, and cheese, and the special, which had no sauce, lots of cheese, prosciutto, apples, and rosemary. Both were incredible. Also, the crust is perfect - thin, with the chewiness of a thicker crust.  All in all, a great experience. Eat here.",

Our server stopped by for drink orders however they were out of diet coke, because they only sell it in glass bottles, this was his explanation. Lame!   Once we ordered the pizza, we never saw our server make any other attempt to check on us. Our pizza was dropped off by another server,  and yet it was BURNT, looks and by taste. How do you bring this to the table! I posted a pic as well...This Pizza was tasteless, amd hardly any cheese yet the mushrooms were truly the only compliment i can give and the reason it deserves one star. I really don't understand the hype of this place.  I enjoy gourmet food but i assume alpo has more flavor then our pizza did.  Don't waste your time and money,  there's plenty of other tastey restaurants in that area to choose from.",

Various types of cheeses, marmalade (little too sweet for my liking, but definitely homemade) to pair with a glass of wine perhaps.  I had the dish with short ribs.  Whew, some of the best, most tender I've ever had!  While I couldn't finish all of my risotto, I made sure not to leave one bite of meat!  Quite flavorful, even if the texture of the risotto was not my favorite.  I also tasted the fettuccine, which the next table over was raving about.

We were seated immediately and presented menus.  The menu is simple and I like that.  Small Plates, a couple pasta dishes. beer, wine and of course the world famous Pizza.    We started with prosciutto wrapped fontina, at $10 it was seriously delicious.  We then ordered the gnocchi, $18, which was one of the specials of the night.  I can say I have never eaten this dish better anywhere.  We finished with the Wise Guy Pizza $18, featuring Schreiners Fennel Sausage, roasted onion and mozzarella.

We were promptly seated in a tastefully decorated restaurant. Our waiter took our drink order quickly, and we decided to try a margherita pizza. Someone gave us a beautiful little bowl of olives, and I watched our waiter (and other waiters) give various tables bread. I'm not sure if we ordered the wrong thing and it didn't come with bread, or if our waiter was careless, but we never got bread.  Our pizza came out quickly enough but our server didn't give us any plates. After our pizza came out, I watched our waiter try to sell desserts to the table immediately next to us; he definitely saw that we received our food but we had to wait until I flagged down a busboy and asked him to get us some plates before we could eat. This took 3-4 minutes so our pizza was a lukewarm by the time we tried it.  Pizza was so delicious - crispy, thin, beautiful crust, fresh toppings (although I would have liked a few more basil leaves, but that's minor). After sitting around a few minutes longer and trying to catch our waiter's eye, he stopped by to sell us a dessert. We tried the tiramisu, which was excellent - best I've ever had. It came with a little fresh fruit and a beautiful whipped cream. I loved it.  We finally got our bill and left. I didn't like the poor service on part of the waiter, I did not like how cramped the seating is, and there was a gentlemen, perhaps the manager, who walked by a couple tables and loudly greeted regular customers. It's important to also greet new customers and ask how the service and food are; instead, he sat behind us at the bar area and loudly discussed scheduling for the employees. It just didn't make for a nice dinner atmosphere.  I want to try the other location; perhaps the service is better. Overall, beautiful, wonderful food, but subpar service. It'll be awhile before I go back.",

Bianco was in da' house which added up extra kuddos to the place, specially because one would think that now that he's a rock star he would be arrogant but all the contrary, he was super pleasant and down to earth.  I had the specials of the day which were delicious. Watermelon salad and gnocci with meat.   The gnocci were my very favorite, what a dish!   The desert was made by Bianco's mother herself, which was also superb! A banana tiramisu-like cake that was one of the best deserts I've had lately.   Apparently, Bianco's mother brings desert on Thursdays, keep that in mind.  I tried the wise guy pizza which was also excellent.  I'll be back within two weeks.  If that wasn't enough, the decor and charm of the place is outstanding. Rustic with a touch of elegant.  If I have to define Bianco's concepts I would say he trims the BS and focuses in food quality, which is pretty hard to find, specially in AZ.  An instant favorite for me, for sure.  Cheers!",

Lucky for us, the owner and chef, Chris, was at this location. He even came to greet us on his way out to head to the restaurant on Adams.  Go try this place. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The Town & Country location just didn't compare to the original location downtown for me. I'm not sure if it the overall quality/experience or the anticipation that comes with dining at the downtown location. When you wait 2 hours for food, does it taste better because you are so starving by the time you get it...? I think it was a combination of both. Here is the rundown with our experience at T & C:  Pros: - Obviously, the lack of wait time. We were able to walk right in on at Saturday night at 8:00 pm. - Service was very friendly. Our waiter, the hostess, and even someone from the bar who came by to check on our drinks. -Good wine selection.  Cons: - They don't allow you to split pizzas (half one flavor, half the other). The downtown location does, so we were thrown off by this. -  It is pretty loud and cramped as some other reviews mention. - It might be a seasonal thing, but the olives (as a side order) were not the same as we previously had downtown. The others were the largest, freshest tasting green olives I have ever had in my life. These were more your standard fare olives. -The food came almost eerily fast (about 10 minutes). This makes me a little nervous of how freshly made the orders are. Especially in combination with the fact that they don't customize or allow you to do half pizzas... -We had the Sonny Boy and it was just okay. Great crust, but the overall flavor was not impressive. It also had a very strange odor when they first set it down and similar aftertaste.   I will probably give this another try  to see if the experience is any better, but honestly with so many other amazing pizza options in the Arcadia/Biltmore area, it won't be anytime soon.",
