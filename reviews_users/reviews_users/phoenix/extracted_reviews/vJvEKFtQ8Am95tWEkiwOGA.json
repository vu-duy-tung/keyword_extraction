    "text": "King's Fish House has become one of my favourite places for seafood.  Seattle is one of my homes away from home, so I am picky when it comes to my seafood preferences.  I want things to be fresh from the ocean and deliciously prepared.  The first time I went to King's, was after an afternoon of running errands.  I had seen it and been uncertain of what to think.  I was seated quickly and given sour dough bread quickly.  The lemondrop martini was perfect.  Many bars get this simple drink wrong, but not King's--it had the sugar rim and perfect balance of lemon juice, vodka, and other ingredents that I wanted. The raw oysters were delicious and presented appetizingly.  My trout almondine was flaky and fresh, served with a wonderful side of rosemary new potatoes.  I felt completely spoilt and decadent when I left.   My other visits have been equally stellar.  One time, the server offered to get me an item not on the regular menu: salmon served on a cedar plank.  The salmon was covered with a delicious assortment of spices and carmelized brown sugar.  It makes me want to get my own cedar plank for cooking.  I can't wait to go back!  The selection and freshness of the raw oysters alone are reasons to check it out, along with the retro decor.  KUDOS!",

Both were excellent.  Once we got seated (about :30min later) we ordered the breaded halibut and the crab legs. I was impressed by the excellent service and overall food quality. I will definitely return and recommend Kings Fish House.",

They used really shrimp, not the frozen stuff you get at most restaurants. The clam chowder was also very good. The ciopinno was good also. The amount and variety of seafood was good and the sauce it was cooked in was really good. I have had some good, and not so good ciopinno. I have to say this was pretty good.   My waiter was really nice and the atmosphere was great. The only reason I am giving them a four star is because the portion for the angel hair and shrimp was small for the price. They could have also give a couple more pieces of garlic bread with the ciopinno.",

    "text": "Bottom line:  Food great--server must have been new or over stressed.  Place was noisy.  We were one of three large groups all seated in the same area, which increased the noise level.   We were a group of 8 -- arriving 10 minutes apart. 2nd  group arrived just as 1st group were getting water which was then given to second group arriving.  One member of first group waited a good 15 minutes to get water and had to ask a couple of times with a dismayed response on part of server that guest would want water.   Drinks took forever .  Server apologized that bar was busy though  we could see no one in the bar.   Food came quickly, was hot and as requested.  4 beet salads were fantastic but they are large.  All servings are large.  Most in the group opted for a only one or two appetizers which were more than adequate as an entree.   A couple of full meals in the group which were beautifully done and excellent quality.  Shared desert of creme brulee was excellent.   We will go back but hope the service has improved a whole lot.",

Calamari best cooked is lightly fried, with a butter garlic sauce, porchini pepper rings, and a zesty marinara sauce. It also shouldn't be tough or chewy it should melt in your mouth. I had a shrimp in marinara and it didn't have much flavor. This isn't one of the better chains at Tempe Markerplace. I won't be coming back here. I'm from New England so maybe I'm picky....",

In the failed Tempe marketplace, where even the Levi store cannot make it sits Kings....an overpriced horrible restaurant that was empty for lunch last Saturday. I would have had better food at jack in the box.  My tacos, which I did complain about, were disgusting....they even messed up the cilantro...which takes effort. You are supposed to use the leaves only...not the stems, the stems are inedible.  I was pulling them out from each bite. Very gracefulI , I was told they were purposely placed there to make a rustic taco....so I guess I can serve a pile of crap and call it rustic? No salsa and stale chips were the perfect accompaniment.... My husband ordered a shrimp salad. The lettuce was old and brown. No one could be bothered to toss it, it had the look of a thrown in handful of each stale ingredient with a tiny amount of shrimp. You could almost see the plastic gloves and the bored underpaid kitchen staff...( wanna bet? ) stay away unless you like bread for dinner. By some miracle the bread is still edible. Please do not believe any good reviews you see here...it is simply impossible that this restaurant transforms into anything but what I saw...a lowly corporate effort........very overpriced.....I would be shocked if they make it year.",

    "text": "Visiting PHX so we wanted to try something we did not have back home. Walked in and was greeted by a friendly hostess who quickly sat us at our table. She did great and earned one of the two stars above. Asked if it was our first visit which it was and continued to welcome us as we walked to our table. Then the waitress came and took our drink orders and also asked if it was out first visit. She then explained the menu in detail and answered our questions. I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered the fried shrimp. Up until this point our visit was fine and the helpfulness of the waitress earned the second star. The water tasted funny but we chalked it up to being in a different city. Once the food came I grabbed a fry which they were delicious. The waitress came by and asked how are \"first bites\" were. Well I had not taken one yet but my wife answered \"so far so good\". Then I thought to myself that's different, but thought it was cool that she came to check on us right away. Well that first bite of fish was disgusting. The fish was extremely oily and slimy. The batter was raw on the underside or so soggy from the oil that it tasted raw. I really wanted to like it cause I was starving so I tried the other piece, NOPE same nastiness. So I let my plate sit there till the waitress came by again. A few minutes later she came by and instead of asking if everything was ok she asked if I was finished and took my plate. Now, who sees a full plate of food with one small bite missing from the main part of the dish and assumes I'm done and that everything was ok!?!?!  I'm not a child, I'm a full grown 225 pound man. How many grown men that you know eat two bites of a $20 plate and then are full? Not once did she ask again how our meal was. Just brought the check and that was it. So since I wasn't asked I paid for my meal, left a note about the fish and told them to look for my review on Yelp. Then I walked out hungry and ate some McDonald's on the way home. If I can eat McDonald's you know my expectations are not that high but the fish at Kings was so subpar I would have rather paid $20 for a filet - O - fish sandwich. Lol. Needless to say we will not be returning, must've been why the restaurant was so empty at prime dinner time on a Friday night. Should've been a red flag when we walked in. Waitress if your reading this it's nothing against you. I know you didn't cook that crap. But learn from it. You got potential but pay attention.",

I asked for crackers with my chowder, just to be sure, and they assured me that they'd put that with my order. My husband asked for fish and chips.  When I get there to pick it up and got a look at the receipt I almost fainted. They charged $18 for the fish and chips; the cup of clam chowder was $7 and when I got the bag home and opened it up, it was on the small side for a cup. There were also NO crackers for my clam chowder. The pieces of fish were rather big, but not big enough to warrant spending $18.",

    "text": "Sometime I wonder what happened to Bennigans...and now I know: it's come back as King's Fish House.  And in case you aren't getting the profuse, dripping sarcasm, that's no compliment.   More expensive, far more pretentious, so average yet aims so high.  My food was very, very average. Best thing was the grilled asparagus but balsamic and Parmesan is something I can do myself. Fish was blah. Really. While I certainly didn't ask anyone to taste my fish, I'm telling you, no one you or I know would have sampled my fish and exclaimed, \"God, this is good!\" because it wasn't. It was BLAND. No smoke flavor, no benefit from plank-cooking. Really, the problem was:                       NO FLAVOR.   And they're not giving anything away. Let me put it to you this way: as I was walking out I passed a 12-top, 12 folks chomping away at a variety of seafood, and all I could think of was the guy who signs that check for $900 is not going home happy. It's a friggin' Bennigans and now it's a $1000 bucks.  Oh, and one more thing: maybe could you let the staff at King's Fish House know:  per State Law: you are not once allowed to touch face/hair/each other while serving food?  Good Lord!  How do you get a foodhandlers card in Maricopa County and not know this?  Hmmm.  Somehow King's Fish House employees missed these memos. Sheesh. Or worse. Its disgusting and I saw at least half a dozen crewmembers ignore this strict food policy.   HAND CONTAMINATION  IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF  FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS. Fact.   IF YOU TOUCH YOUR FACE OR HAIR YOU MUST WASH     Slow Service.  There wasn't one thing, not one instance I encountered in my visit that could've been defined as \"prompt\". Doesn't the word \"tip\", stand for \"to insure promptness\"? Kinda does.   And one more thing, (again): fix your website. I hit \"contact us\" and got the recipe page. I hit the recipe page link and got recipes. The prices on the menu were not at all current.  IN OTHER WORDS, WHY ISN'T ANYONE AT BENNIGANS, errrrr, KING'S FISH HOUSE -- paying attention to your website?  And one more thing: do ya just take any image, of anyone, anything, put a frame around it, and hang it in the wall?  Is that interior decorating nowadays?  Because they've got stuff on the wall that is so random, so arbitrary, so busy, so nothing-to-do-with-fish, it's not so much \"odd\"as it is just so ordinary. No one, not even King's Fish House, aspires to ordinary.   So average. Slow service. Buy somebody else's Groupon...or just go around the corner to Portillos. This place blows.",

From the fish and chips to her warm welcoming personality, our experience was 110% excellent.  Even if the food wasn't good, I would go back just to have Teresa serve me again. She was absolutely amazing",

I have been coming to Kings Fish House for years. During the last few visits we got Cassandra (Cassie) as a waitress. I have to say that I have travel extensively, and living in the desert can be quite scary when it comes to fresh fish. Cassie has been awesome and patient to bring our 5+ lobsters per sitting and a few dozen oysters per sitting  (for only two people) and always great quality that totally taste fresh n. We can not recommend this place enough. This last occasion we got Kaylin as our server. We remembered her from our last time that we visited, since she was the covering manager. I have to say that she is another amazing waitress with superb customer service skills. Very professional to say the least. Now we have two awesome servers to come visit and more breaking records to look forward with amazing lobster to come. Maybe we will do 6 lobsters and 3 dozen oysters next",

She said to drop her an email and she would let us know. In mid April I received an email describing the two crab dishes.  Tonight we both both ordered the steam dungeness crab which comes with 2 sides. Started off by splitting a Cesar Salad. The romaine lettuce was cold and crisp with some type of anchovie  dressing. Yummy, that started off our fabulous meal. The crab comes with crab butter which is very flavorful. You have to crack the legs and separate the meat from the body, but HEY, that's what eating dungeness crab is all about. I would get as much meat in the crab butter before tasting it. Working too slow causes the sides and crab to cool down. My side of asparagus was cooked on the grill and was OK, thought it was slughtly overcooked and the baked potato was the way I liked it.  The meal was very filling, so come with an appetite. Restaurant is always clean and our server was knowledgeable  and attentive. Michelle also advised us that they we be serving Soft Shell crab by the end of the month. We'll be back.",

Both pieces of fish were beautifully cooked and we enjoyed the asparagus, carrots, Brussels sprouts and zucchini.  So why not a five?  Frankly I didn't feel welcome.  At one point, after a twenty minute wait, I approached the front desk and asked if they would try to find our server.  After a minute, our server ambled over and asked if we wanted something other than just water.  It was just odd and created kind of an awkward feeling in the place.  Maybe other couples  do go out to a restaurant on a Friday evening and just drink water but we kinda wanted some wine and some food.  At the end of the meal, a lovely lady who told us she was the manager asked us who our server was.  We gave her the name and she stated that server is one of her favorites.  Hard to be critical at that point.  I think this restaurant could get a 5 - the food was great.  Just some training on how to interact with other humans would probably help.",

We waited around for about 30 minutes before we were seated.  The wait time isn't so bad when you're guzzling pina colados and bloody marys with great company.    When we finally were seated, we ordered two oyster samplers, the baja ceviche fish cocktail, a garden salad with Caesar dressing on the side [my friend is quirky like that], a hot seafood combo, and the macadamia nut crusted Alaskan halibut.  The oysters were delicious and the ceviche was refreshing.  The salad had ranch dressing poured all over it even though we had asked for Caesar dressing on the side.  When we asked our waitress about this, she apologized and said she'll bring us a new salad in 5mins which actually came out 20mins later after a reminder from my friend.  Oh well.  It's just salad and it *was* pretty busy.  The seafood combo was very flavorful and delicious but the biggest disappointment was the overcooked halibut.  I was most excited for the halibut so when I ate a fork full of dried fish, I was pretty sullen.  My overall experience with King's Fish House wasn't too bad but I think I'll just stick with drinks and oysters the next time I stop by.",

I really appreciated the extra step in her reaching out and inviting us back for a better experience.  We started out with the raw oyster sampler.. delish! I only wish that the waiter would've stopped by and pointed out which was Oyster was which so I could know which ones to order next time. Otherwise, they arrived in a timely fashion and with all the yummy condiment additions.   I ordered the jumbo lump crab small plate as my entree with a side of grilled asparagus. Nice and filling portions of crab meat, drizzled in a spicy cocktail sauce and atop a bed of diced cucumber. The asparagus side is enough to share between people so don't let the price deter you from ordering it..it comes drizzled in soy sauce and breadcrumbs. For you health nuts, my dish left me satisfied without feeling like I busted my diet. Just maybe don't wash it down with 3 glasses of wine like I did :)  My fiance ordered lobster tail and a medium prepared steak with a sides of mac n' cheese and whipped potatoes. He enjoyed everything (he ate the lobster tail in no time!) but the steak which was a bit over prepared and tough.  Our server did a great job all in all, was attentive without being too in our space.   I truly appreciate Michelle going above and beyond to ensure we had a better experience. We will most definitely return to King's next time we are around Tempe and craving some seafood!",

Since we live in NW Glendale we were hoping King's would be better than average.  It was.  Oysters were great... not too fishy and a great assortment of sides with it.  Even tried some tuna sushi.  Courses went from scallops to macadamia crusted halibut to N'awlins shrimp.  5 drinks between us and a couple appetizers as well as a couple of deserts.  We requested to be seated outside (it was really nice outside) but no one was out there and it was a Wednesday night... makings for disastrous wait staff problems.  But we had a great waiter who came just the perfect amount of times even though we were \"out of the way\".  So... It's a 30 mile trek for us... and we won't go back all the time but we will go back when we want a great seafood restaurant!",

It took FOREVER to get our appetizer...then an eon to get our entrees. It wasn't busy, as there were only 4 occupied tables present (small parties of 2-4). It took 25 minutes for us to receive our Cold Seafood Platter appetizer. Possibly another 10-15 minutes for our entrees after we finished our appetizer. Not sure where the service failure originated, if it was the kitchen or our server. But they were slower than a herd of turtles. I did enjoy my meal. It was definitely enough so fill me up. The quality was good. The taste satisfying. Presentation appealing. I ordered the King Crab Legs that come along with 2 side. I chose the Grilled Zucchini and Caesar Salad. The zucchini was grilled to perfection. The caesar salad was a liitle dry. It could have had a little more dressing added to it. This wasn't my first time here. It won't be the last time either. There are few places in the Phoenix Valley to get select fresh seafood at lunch time. This place beats the socks off of Seafood Market off of Baseline in the Dana Park Plaza. The prices are a little higher but much worth it as the quality of the fish and seafood is exceptional for being in the desert.",

For the most part the experience was fine, but we went as a group and most of us echoed what many previous reviews say: it's just plain overpriced.  The food is Denny's quality and Morton's prices.      I got the Cobb Salad which should be easy, but right away my problem was that it was $17 and mostly a plate of iceberg lettuce with a few other ingredients thrown on to break up the bland, pale green presentation.    I expect a bowl of iceberg lettuce to masquerade as a \"salad\" at McDonald's or maybe as a dinner salad included with a meal at Denny's.  Otherwise iceberg lettuce should never be used outside of a nursing home.    My companions had several other dishes, but all had the same feedback, nothing really wrong, but the prices seemed way out of line for the quality of food that they got.   If you are going to spend $20 to $30 a person for a meal (before alcohol or dessert), you have much, much better options.",

    "text": "I am giving King's Fish House three stars on customer service and that is about it. After my last review on our poor experience on Mother's Day I was contacted by the manager Kari. She was very nice to have offered to correct the situation and to give King's the chance to correct the problems that we experienced on our last visit.  We arrived tonight around 5:45pm. We were promptly seated and our server arrived within minutes of us being seated. She was very nice and attentive. I asked her how the mojitos were and she suggested that I get one. Unfortunately I would have to say the mojito was probably the best item of the night. My fiance ordered the filet cooked medium and I ordered the King's combo (fried shrimp, fish and scallops). The shrimp were pretty good, the fish was okay and the scallops were just the same as the last time I reported, gritty. My fiance's steak was severely under seasoned and had no flavor at all. He also got a baked potato which instead of being overcooked (previous visit) it was cold in the middle. I got coleslaw and corn as sides. The corn was good but the coleslaw had no flavor at all. For the prices that are charged at this restaurant I cannot believe the quality of food.  I am sorry to say that I will not ever be back here. Thank you Kari for the opportunity to make things right but unfortunately I think the quality of food is out of your hands.",

    "text": "Ate here on Father's Day plus 1, a hot Monday evening!  My son invited me out to celebrate his Dad, a loving gesture.  At 5:15 PM the place was very quiet, but then to be expected on a Monday night after a holiday.  The restaurant had a somewhat rustic appeal to the inner fisherman.  It had a clean look and no fishy odors detected.  The booth was large and comfortable.  Our server was pleasant and efficient.  My son ordered \"Jumbo Shrimp Ballerine\", (Tomatoes, garlic, basil and white wine) with tail-on shrimp, looked like about 8, with pasta in a mild red sauce with chunks of stewed tomatoes .... (18.95).  Not a lot of flavor but the medium shrimp were fresh tasting.  For starters I had a cup of King's Spicy Seafood Chowder .... (5.25) (but a dollar off with an entree).  Fabulous chowder, loaded with fish and potatoes, very spicy but super delicious.  This alone would  get me to return!  Next came Wild Costa Rican Mahi Mahi.... (21.95) which I ordered blackened, accompanied by Grilled Zucchini and Sauteed Fresh Spinach.  The veggies were vibrantly colored and super fresh tasting.  I had to send back the spinach because it was cold which our waiter did rapidly and graciously.  The fish was perfectly cooked, reminded me of New Orleans.  No room for desert unfortunately.  This is a very nice place for tasty fresh and properly cooked seafood, in a pleasant atmosphere.  I shall return.",

    "text": "I got into a seafood kick and convinced a coworker to tag along. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of non fast-food seafood places in Tempe. Google Maps pointed out King's Fish House.  The menu looks amazing. However lunch during the work week isn't the time to crack shells or have a food coma over an over indulgence. I had fried oysters on the brain and seriously considered several of the 7 or so different raw oysters (the Tempe menu is a little different from the one online).  We started with the fried oyster appetizer. The 5-6 pieces were lightly deep fried and were really oily. The breading didn't have a chance to stay on for very long but the oysters themselves were very tasty. The cocktail sauce was light and the tartar sauce was average. The spicy garlic sauce in a bottle at the table added a little nice kick.  Coworker ordered the skewered scallops and shrimp. They were overcooked. A scallop was cut in half with a fork and it sprung back into place like rubber. The shrimp was dry even with half the shell still on it. The blackened 5-6oz Atlantic salmon (Farmed Cypress Island Salmon) was half good and half very dry and overcooked. A few minutes after ordering, I had a feeling I should have ordered the swordfish. However it was seasoned well, was tasty and had a nice charred flavor to it. The grilled zucchini was very good. But again only half of the very unevenly sliced pieces were grilled - the ungrilled pieces were a bit undercooked (not really that big of a deal) and seemed to have missed all of the seasoning, too. The creamy-looking garlic mashed potatoes looked as if they were plain but had the perfect amount of garlic flavor to it.  There was a little bit of a wait between drinks/appetizer and the main dishes but the service was very good and our server was very attentive. The restaurant is spacious with high ceilings and gave it a roomy feeling.  I've noticed that this place seems to be evenly hit and miss with Yelpers (+grain of salt). The oyster selection will bring me back for another go but having all of our main dishes overcooked was really disappointing.",

The swordfish was juicy and I loved that the spinach was cooked with lemon juice and garlic.  It wasn't extremely busy and the server staff was very attentive. My server, Katie, was very friendly and did a great job checking back with me to see if I was enjoying my meal!  I enjoyed it so much that I went back today for lunch and had the same meal but with mashed potatoes! I sat in Katie's section again and she immediately remembered me. Overall, great food and cozy atmosphere!",

    "text": "This was my fourth time here. As always the quality of the seafood is the best I've had since arriving in Phoenix. Oysters were terrific, chowder (my son's) didn't last long enough for else to try so I'll assume it was good.  The fried combo platter was delicious, the fries were a bit soggy and underwhelming. My son had the grilled scallops and shrimp, they were sweet and toothsome, mac and cheese also didn't last long enough for anyone else to try, so we'll assume again. The hazelnut crusted salmon was meaty and fragrant, the grilled asparagus had a tart/sweet balsamic glaze that was a great accompaniment.  A family sat next to use with a small child. When the child was served his King's Fish House sippy cup, my son instantly recalled the one he had a few years ago. So King's makes good memories for family dinners.  Go there and splurge a little on the raw bar, you wont regret it.",

Other than that, the food was terrible and for what it cost it really was so so disappointing. I ordered the shrimp and crab Louie. It came in a big plate and the vegetables were all cut in at least half inch chunks including the red onion and iceberg lettuce. It was very unpleasant to eat. There was some shrimp and crab but all mixed up so you had a hard time telling what was what. Not much either. I am at a loss of who it would have been that prepared this salad. My nine year old granddaughter makes a better salad.   I was with my sister and she ordered the mahi-mahi with a side of spinach and zucchini. Everything was so over cooked it looked like it was three days old and had been warmed up a couple of times. The mahi-mahi was so dry it stuck in her throat. She would have sent it back, but she was so hungry she didn't want to go through the hassle. Being a big chain all over CA you'd think at least they could get the prep and cooking of the food down. We will never come again and will need to warn our friends not to.",

I went reluctantly with some friends because I'm not much of a fish guy, but our server Lori made some excellent suggestions and I was completely satisfied with it all. I started off with a wedge  salad (which I'll go back just for that! ) and at Lori's suggestion,  had the Macadamia Halibut. Suffice it to say, I might be a fish guy now. Buttery, flaky and full of flavor, I was impressed!  Our server was so attentive as well. Drinks never were empty and empty plates disappeared without notice. A 5 star dining experience without the  $$$$  Best part was it was a light enough meal that dessert was a forgone conclusion!  Did I mention how amazing the key lime pie was?

She was welcoming, informative, patient, fast and just soooo awesome!   Although it was sad to see her leave us, she handed us over to a great spunky waitress named Cassandra who was also very sweet and helpful!   The food was amazing!  The Buttercake was fantastic!!!

I am deathly allergic to shellfish, so I'm impressed when the staff takes note and ensures that my meal will not result in a call for paramedics.  (Please note - I take the risk because I can eat fish - just not shellfish.)   Our department held their holiday lunch here - great day for patio seating (heaters and wind shields in place made it bright, cheery and comfortable).  GREAT place for a group of 40.   They had set up a special menu for us with 4 soup/salads, 4 entrees and 2 dessert options.  I ordered the Caesar salad, blackened tilapia, and apple cobbler.  I loved that our server checked to make sure that I was good with anchovies in the salad dressing, and ensured me that my food would be prepared in a way not to cross-contaminate with the shrimp orders.   The warm loaves of bread were a big hit with the group.  Those who opted for the seafood chowder and clam chowder really seemed to enjoy them. My meal was perfect - a generous order of fish, seasoned perfectly; grilled zucchini slices and creamy potatoes.  I ate every bite.  My cobbler had the right amount of ice cream.   Great service, good food, and great location.",

The fried shrimp and scallops paired well with the cocktail sauce. I tried some of the King Crab and it was a mix between Snow Crab and Lobster as the texture was deliciously dense. I also had a cup of Clam Chowder which was buttery and creamy.",

A classic tourist trap for those visiting Tempe. Over priced box store restaurant! Don't find yourself like me ordering what I thought was going to be a real East Coast lobster roll only to find a 4 inch by 1-1/2inch around dinner roll with 2 ounce of canned lobster and a scattering if fries and coleslaw all for a huge price of $20 plus dollars! I thought I had mad a visit to Tiny Town! For the price and portions size don't eat here! Go eat st a Long John Silvers- you'll at least get more food at a fraction of this joints cost with equal quality! I done and out!",

I got the New England Clam Chowder, which was very good, My wife got the King's Platter, which had fried scallops, beer battered fish and fried shrimp. All cooked to perfection and delicious. I got the grilled swordfish taco's and they were very good. Our friend got the grilled swordfish and it was tender, moist and a ver nice sized portion. Our friend also got the creme brulee and it was perfectly prepared. Well worth the trip to Tempe!!!",

My partner is a huge seafood fan, and he was in heaven with the oysters, crab, shrimp and scallops here. Totally fresh, prepared expertly. Beautiful presentation on the cold platter.  For me, there's lots to choose from. Chicken, excellent pasta, salad. I got the tomato basil ballerine pasta and it was fantastic. I tried the garlic mashed potatoes too. Totally yummy. I have to bring my mom here, as she loves steak and our server told us King's gets its meat from a high-end dealer...so the steak isn't an afterthought in this seafood place. That's very cool. I love the atmosphere, the decor and the feel of the place, too. They only built it a few years ago and it really looks like an older, classic restaurant.  Our server, Timber, was fantastic too. Very friendly, attentive and really seems to enjoy her job. I love that when people are interested and even passionate about what they do!  We are definitely coming back. I'm glad we live nearby!",

The bartender sat us in the restaurant ,but where he could see us in the bar. He was our waiter,which was fine until he got busy. M's Fish dinner had to be sent back because it was just not that good and incredibly salty. They did make him another one which came out much better. It was not the worst fish I have ever had, but not the best either.  Maybe because, it is Phoenix and I am comparing it with other cities. But, sad to say I am not a fan. However, the corn was really good. I am not a corn eater normally, but it was cut fresh off the corn and was really good.  The reason I am giving 5 stars is the dessert. It was such good Key lime Pie! I mean really good. They say they make it right there in the restaurant! It tasted just like what I had in The Keys! Who would ever think that you would go for fish and love the dessert instead, but it happened. This is a place I would go to in the future for dessert for sure, the seafood is better than Red Lobster, but that is not saying much. Because, I cannot say I would ever go to a Red Lobster ever again. I might go back here though. Maybe we just need to give it another try.   I thought the cocktail napkins were really cute. The menus are printed up every day so that would indicate they maybe just had a bad fish day. Bathrooms were clean and the parking is easy.",

Upon arrival, it is confusing because the entrance is on the north, when parking is behind. So then we went in the wrong door, into the Oyster Bar, not seeing a clear entrance. The hostess was fantastic, and we were seated right away. Our server Steven came to take the drink order promptly, but did not return promptly. I sat there for a good 20 minutes with a super hard chunk of cold bread with warm butter...and no drink. Our drinks were dropped, but we were not asked if we were ready to order or if we had any questions in the menu. And we wait. My pina colada was not well blended and quickly looked like the crushed ice at the bottom of your big gulp after the beverage is gone. Should have just gotten a beer or something else. Our orders are taken. And we wait. The cold platter arrives, which has an ample sampling of shrimp, crab and oysters with the accoutrements. The oysters were fresh and sweet. Horseradish freshly ground. I can't compare the oysters, since I've never had an oyster before. The shrimp were large and also fresh. I was not exactly elated at having to dig the intestinal tract out of most of my shrimp. I wasn't expecting to devein before I eat at a restaurant. The crab was not served with a cracker, so we tried our best on the thinner shelled legs. When we finally see Steven later, we ask for a cracker. And we wait. We finally finish in time for the entrees to arrive with perfect timing. I have the crab cakes with asparagus. Both are tasty and are cooked well. My husband ordered the N'Awlins BBQ shrimp. The sauce was hot but not very flavorful. At least those shrimp had been deveined! There was a random piece of lemon mixed in, and my husband, thinking it a pepper or something, got a big sour surprise! The entrees went well overall. And we wait. The hostess clears our table and my husband has been waiting for another beer for.ever. Steven returns and says \"Are you all set and done or did you want dessert?\". Maybe I'm crazy, but I found it a bit brash. It's not like I'm getting a free meal and someone told you I'm a crappy tipper (I'm an excellent topper, btw...I was a server once). Dessert (yes I want it! It's my birthday!) was Strawberry Shortcake, but only since they were out of Creme Brulee. Who runs out on Thursday?? Boo. The shortcake was cold, dry and hard. Not impressed.  It is not likely that we will return to King's Fish House.",

    "text": "While visiting Arizona we decided to look for an oyster house/seafood and came across Kings Fish House. We sat at the bar to watch some college football and get some snacks. Our bartender was very knowledgable on menu items and gave us great suggestions. The place is large and clean. You can also go pick out ur own lobster if u want. We decided to pick out three different oysters to try, yellow tail carpaccio, and Mac n Cheese. Yellow tail was like butter and also very spicy! I took off the jalapeno and it was perfection. I highly recommend Naked Cowboy oysters,Those were from NY. We also go Fanny Bay and Hood Canal from WA. Fanny bay were our second favorite it had a crisp taste w a punch at the end. Hood Canal surprisingly was our least favorite, it was way to fishy and \"seaweed-ish\" not pleasant. Our Mac n cheese was good.I've had better, only criticism on it was that it was a bit dry and stiff. My bf loved his bloody marry and I got a stoli vanilla w iced tea and it hit the spot ! I recommend u come try it out there are plenty of options for every taste bud and they have a neat patio! Come by",

    "text": "Well.....strike two for you! After my last bad experience at this restaurant, I was immediately contacted by management. They were very apologetic and assured me that what had happened was not their policy. They followed up with sending me a $50.00 gift card, which was not necessary, but an appreciated good gesture. I gave them another try on January 24, 2018 at about 3pm to be sure to get Happy Hour prices. Well, if you can believe it? It was again a disaster! The first bill brought to me, over charged me by $20.00! I was billed for a premium wine that I did not order @ $12.00 per glass (my wine was $5.50 per glass). I asked the bartender if the wine was not on Happy Hour? He said no, but then admitted he had incorrectly charged me for a different wine. Yes, he was apologetic and corrected that error. Next, I gave him the gift  card that I had been given to pay for my bill. You guessed it!, It was no good!!! I was told by the manager that he could comp my charges ($34.38) but could not give me the remaining balance?! He suggested that I pay for this meal, and he would activate me a new card?! Well in the end he was unable to activate a new card but returned my invalid card w a note stating it was worth $50.00??? I am extremely grateful that I did not have a guest with me as it would have been even more embarrassing.  While I must say they were polite and apologetic, I can't help but wonder what's going on?? Do they pad these bar bills hoping most will just overlook it? Do they not have a petty cash fund to cover such mishaps? To ask a previously dissatisfied customer to pay them again for poor practices? Watch your wallet at this place!!!",

    "text": "Decided to try this place when our first choice the Salt Cellar had a 3 hour wait.  We arrived about 6 on a Saturday night to find the place virtually empty, greeted by 2 people at the door, they were pleasant and sat us right away. Waiter greeted us almost immediately with a loaf of sourdough bread. Bread was fresh but cold..would have been so, so much better if it would have been warm.   Husband ordered a lobster crunch roll and a salad to start his meal. The crunch roll was awesome, so very tasty. The salad was one word..meh. Way too much dressing that left the romaine lettuce wilted and soggy, plus the $4.95 price tag was a little excessive for a cup of lettuce, one small tomato wedge and a couple croutons.  Our entrees took FOREVER. The waiter came by several times to fill our drinks and tell us that our food would be out shortly. The couple across from us were seated probably a  good 10 minutes after us, had the same waiter and received their food a good 10 minutes before us. We both ordered the petite filet medium with spiny lobster tail. When our dinner finally arrived my filet was more like medium well and his was medium rare, both lobsters were over cooked slightly. All of the food was tasty just not prepared to our liking. One of my sides was fresh sauteed spinach and it was awesome, garlicky but not to much, the other was a standard baked potato. Husband chose the mac & cheese and coleslaw. Coleslaw was standard deli style, nothing to write home about..neither of us tasted the mac but it did look good, a little on the dry side with a light brown crust.  The meal as a whole was enjoyable taste wise but in all honesty it's just a step up from Red Lobster with a very expensive price tag. For the appetizer, salad,  the 2 entrees and 2 non-alcoholic beverages our tab was $128. Service was good, he refilled our drinks several times and asked if everything was ok..and it was just ok. Restaurant and restrooms were very clean.  I would make a visit back to King's if we were in the area just for that lobster crunch roll, it really was the best part of our meal, but we would probably not make a special trip to go back.  A solid 3.5 stars.",

He consistently brought bread and drinks without ya ever having to ask, and brought our food out in minutes and consistently checked on us to make sure we were doing okay. The management of this restaurant should be very proud of their employees and how hard they work. The food was amazing and we left extremely happy. I would recommend this to everyone.",

Pros: Good service, great bread, AMAZING oysters  My family shared Fanny Bay oysters and they were absolutely wonderful and plated beautifully. The mignonette was also amazing and had a very nuanced flavor. If I come back, it will be for these oysters.   After our appetizers things started to go down hill a little bit. To sum up all our dishes- every fish dish was overcooked. Fish is a delicate protein and should be cooked that way. It shouldn't have a texture that resembles chalk. Besides the fish, everything was quite nice (the sides were tasty). For around $20-$25 dollars per plate, it is not worth it. Portions are also small but it wouldn't have mattered if the food was good-which it wasn't.  The manager obviously cares for this restaurant a lot, unfortunately the chef does not. The seafood is obviously of great quality, and it is truly unfortunate that they have been destroyed by not being cooked correctly. I would only recommend this place perhaps for lunch or if you just want to get some drinks with friends because the bread, service, and oysters were well worth the price tag. Don't come here for anything that is cooked.",

Let's start by saying the seafood is reasonably priced for being fresh and seasonal, and I go nuts for the oyster bar!! They print their menu every day, twice a day. So really you may not find the same seafood selection of the day before. They purchase their seafood from all over the world and I particularly love raw Pacific oysters, with lots of lemon. Raw scallops are also delicious! They are covered with a citrusy light sauce and herbs, perhaps to cover the taste of the seawater.  Get a sit at the bar and let Rudy or Stephen take care of you! They're great!!  Their hot dishes are also delicious, from the clam chowder to the lobster roll sandwich, and even the sauteed mussels were not disappointing.  This restaurant is located in Tempe Marketplace just before Thirsty Lion so parking is not an issue.   I'm so glad I live nearby cause I love oysters and there are not many places in town with such selection and quality!",

I Then Had The Grilled Salmon , Garlic Mash , and Spinach & Glass Of Wine. The Restaurant Was Clean & Well Put Together Almost Felt Like I Was In A New York Restaurant Minus The Crowd. For Desert I Was Recommended The Butter Cake & I have to say it was so delicious , haven't had a dessert like that in years. I highly recommend Kings Fish House if your new to Arizona or you haven't been.",

Clam chowder - excellent.  Sushi - overpriced especially for the portion size.  Some seafood was bland and over cooked.  Mashed potatoes were very thick like instant.  Manager offered dessert which was chocolate cake and was a very good choice.  Server was more interested in making sure he gave use a check. Knew the manager had spoken to us yet brought us check without checking with manager first. Then had to remind. Should be more customer focused.  Place was not busy on a Friday night. Will only return for the chowder and cake.  After manager came by to tell us he checked with the kitchen and the mashed potatoes all had to be remade as they were made wrong. But didn't offer a discount for serving us bad potatoes.  Summary need training fcooks, staff and management.    Follow up- I was contacted by a manager offering to comp my next visit. Have yet to receive this.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying when I dislike something a lot I try to bring it to the manager or owners atten because I would hope if I was the owner I want 2 know.  I grew up back east and was very spoiled frequently try traveling to New England for getaways, the clam chowder their is so special and so good when I moved to az and tried the chowder here I thought no more I just surrendered the thought of eating it.  I have been frequenting Kings for 8-10 years.  Combined with the fact that they are the only place in AZ who has authentic New England clam chowder, coupled with an excellent friendly sweet and knowledgeable staff which I cannot give a great review if the dining experience is not super pleasurable. You might even be unlucky enough to get a really nice manager who coaxes you into trying their sweet  bread cake, regularly I'm a chocolate guy the sound of sweet cake doesn't excite mr in the least, if your like me never try it! You could become unexpectedly the next addict running to kings to get your fix.  Lastly the fish is the freshest I have tasted in az the fish &chips is better and more enjoyable than a prime rib, much wife always gets the Alaskan I think swordfish with nuts on it that she raved about.  So, 1) excellent dining atmosphere 2) excellent tasting food 3)excellent,competant,  well mannered and knowledgeable wait staff.4)consistency regarding a high level of excellency in taste, service, atmosphere.5) Desserts that are an eleven on a scale of 1 to 10.  For these 5 important reasons I gave them a 5 star, I have only one time ever given a five star rating in my 53 years and it was to another seafood restaurant in San Francisco.  So keep CV up the great wk hat's off to Kin'gs!!!!!",

You two are going to need to stop the PDA or you will have to leave.  We have children in the restaurant.    I went to the only table in the place with kids  I apologized to them if they were offended.   They replied we are not at all offended in fact we like our children to see affection. Their is not enough in this world.   We laughed and I walked away and paid my bill for $170 and left the bartender a $40 tip however I will never be back there again due to the managers lack of tact and decency.",

Side offerings were sufficient that I did not have to order a carb, instead spinach and carrots did me well. But where was my bread and butter.  Returned on January 12.

After eating loads of oysters earlier this year in Capecod and the southern coast of Spain, I thought the oysters at Kings were on the high end of flavor and freshness! Get the Baja spiny lobster before March, they are excellent!! The Alaskan crab were sweet and not soggy and generously full of meat! The sides were done perfectly too.  This seafood is nothing like the bland junk seafood we experienced at Talking stick seafood place. You definitely get what you pay for. There is a wait for the food and it's worth it to eat in leisure and have the food done well. The wait staff was very nice. I give this place a 9 for food, a 2 for mixed drinks and recommended beer or wine, as my husbands bloodymary had a grossly high amount of horseradish. Other than a few minor drink misses, keep up the great aervice and quality.",

Sis called the ph# on the website and actually spoke to Heath Bumgardner, VP of sales in CA. He was very helpful and took it upon himself to make the dinner reservation for us. Not only did we get the reservation set up, but when we arrived there were 2 bouquets of flowers and 2 birthday cards signed by all the staff wishing us a happy day! What a surprise and delight! Patrick, Teresa and John met us at the front door and came to our table to wish us happy birthday and to make sure we had everything we needed. We had appetizers of grilled oysters and mussels - which were delicious to say the very least - always a good dish if you are looking for more of the same thing! We moved on to lobster and sea bass - which were all prepared expertly and melted in our mouths. Of course being our birthday we had to have dessert - we shared the cheesecake and key lime pie. I have now officially fell in love with both!.  We will DEFINITELY be back next year for Mom's 100th!!!",

My husband ordered fish and chips and I ordered the fried shrimp. 3 of my shrimp tasted pretty good but the last 3 pieces smelled and tasted very fishy, almost like they were unclean. Couldn't finish it. Also got the Mac and cheese for a side and some of the noodles were undercooked but overall has a decent taste. My husbands fish was disgusting. So greasy and soggy and also had a strange unclean fish smell and taste. His side of fries were good though but unfortunately he couldn't even finish his $18 plate. So unless you plan on just eating sides for dinner I'd stay clear of fried fish and shrimp. Here's hoping neither one of us gets sick. Definitely will not be going back.",

The restaurant was quite crowded; we didn't realize there was a major sporting event the next morning and 100,000 people were carb loading for the marathon. The wait was still only 10 minutes and service was quite good. My biggest issue was that a lot of the space smelled like fish. Husband said, \"It's a fish house,\" but no, it shouldn't have a fishy smell!  Husband ordered a hazelnut encrusted salmon and I had the trout amadine. The fish was perfectly cooked. His was sweet in a sort of surprising way. My fish didn't have a lot of flavor, except what came from the sauce. Sadly, there was not enough sauce to cover the ends of the fish.   I like that you can choose your sides. I had mashed potatoes (good) and spinach (they give you a lot but it's not really seasoned; should have used salt and lemon). Didn't taste husband's but he had zucchini and ratatouille.  There's a lot to get into at this place. Like I said, quite decent.",

We went in on a Monday evening and got seated quickly. Our servers name was Cassie; she was friendly, attentive, and patient when I couldn't decide on what I wanted. She suggested sushi or the mahi after listening to me waiver. I got the mahi, which was excellent- perfectly seasoned and not overcooked. My boyfriend ended up ordering some sushi also, which he enjoyed. I will definitely be going back whenever I'm in Arizona.",

We had Salmon for both orders. Very well prepared. Just a nice piece of fish well cooked.   Service was very good.  This is always a go to if we are in the area for a nice piece of fish.",

We went later in the evening, around 8 o'clock or so and we could basically have our pick of the place. For your reading enjoyment, we settled on a booth :)  We ordered a sushi roll, the Rainbow Roll to be specific, and it was hands down the best Rainbow Roll I've ever had (and I've been around the block a couple times when it comes to sushi...). I usually put a touch of ginger on every roll I normally consume. This dining experience-ZERO ginger was used! There was no 'fishiness' to the fish and everything tasted so fresh.  We got the Clam Chowder too. AMAZING.   I got the Cioppino. Definitely a GREAT value for the money. The boyfriend got the Fish-n-Chips. The Fish-n-Chips were a little pricey for what was presented, but no real complaints.    For drinks I got a glass of red and the BF had two on-tap brews. The waiter clued us into a special that was going on at the time. Buy a $100 gift certificate and you received a $20 gift certificate complementary.  We were able to cover all that food, drink and tip with the $100 AND we have TWENTY dollars to go back again.  It's like they want to pay me to stuff my face. Thank you Mr. King Fish house :)",

My favorite thing about the soup was how they chopped the potatoes into small pieces. I know...it's a weird thing to care about, but I do not like big chunks of potatoes so it was perfect! 1/2 DOZEN OYSTER SAMPLER: pretty good, but my mom said she's had better. They were on the smaller side. SHRIMP TAQUITOS: hmmm I think we envisioned these to be made a different way than they were. They weren't horrible, but noting amazing. The shrimp was good, but the wrapper they used was meh.  ROASTED BEETS SALAD: yum!!! So refreshing and delicious! The combination of the beets, nuts, cheese and berries was amazing! Must try (if you like beets)!!!  SERVICE: quick and our server was friendly! No complaints!  PARKING: it's located in the temple marketplace so plenty of free parking.  ATMOSPHERE: Has both indoor and outdoor seating and a lot of space. Very clean and nice decor.",

We just had some Beer (Indian pale ale) and cocktails.The Cosmopolitan was pretty basic nothing extraordinaire! I did like the King's Combo Platter it had Shrimp,scallops,Fish(Cod) with coleslaw and fries with 2 types of dips.The fries can be substituted for mash potatoes or a bunch of other stuff.The scallops and shrimp were crispy and breaded well but the Cod was not crispy and had a little too much oil.  They serve sourdough bread on the table.They also have beautiful outdoor seating. The menu does have a lot of options which i would like to try. Overall it wasn't that Bad and i would go again to check out the Mains.  Cheers!",

When our waiter came to the table he introduced himself and wanted to take our order. Although he was nice enough he seemed in a rush to take our order. Our food arrived, presentation was adequate and food was hot. However, the taste was mediocre. Crab cakes were ok, Coleslaw was tasteless, scallops were over cooked.

Stop removing a valid post.  If you are ashamed of your corporate practices, change them.  I was a patron.  I have been a patron, this is a firsthand experience.  Let's see, I walked into the restaurant on 3/13 at 2:2 and wanted to meet a friend for lunch.  Until I saw the sign preventing someone from lawfully carrying a concealed weapon therefore I had to abide by the Arizona Law which prevented me from having a delicious lunch.  Then, I posted the below feedback which led to a Yelp complaint where someone said I wasn't a customer.  If walking into the restaurant with every expectation of having lunch was met then seeing a sign preventing me from dining doesn't make me a customer then I am unsure what the term means.  Below was my initial post.  After visiting this restaurant for years, I always enter through the oyster bar door but something told me to check their front door where a sign \"preventing\" guns from being lawfully carried inside hung proudly next to the door.  Not wanting to break the law, I immediately exited.  96% of all mass shootings happen in supposed gun free zones.  The restaurant management has every right to not allow lawful carry inside their restaurant and I will find another seafood restaurant to visit.  I encourage any law abiding citizen to do the same if they practice their 2nd Amendment rights.  Now, before the Yelp content police censor this post, I visited the restaurant and I am expressing my concern with their policies regarding patrons",

    "text": "So you think that because this is a chain the quality of the seafood and its preparation could never be good as what you grew up with (for those of you who of course grew up on the ocean - in my case Long Island and New England).  Well, the answer is... it is a chain and it could NEVER be as equally as good.  Here comes the BIG however...  (big)HOWEVER(big), for what this place is I gotta tell ya, you can get a \"thank you that was oh so close\" meal here.    Firstly, the warm bread that they give you unlimited amounts of may be the best in Phoenix.  (Dude, did you just say bread?). Yes, I did!  Bread never tasted so perfect, so yummy.  Fresh out of the oven and perfect every time.    As for the meals, some are better than others and their menu here is VERY seasonal - changes out daily almost.  That said, soft shell crab was in season when we went and a bunch of us got it \"Picatta\" style - lemon, butter and capers.  And... Wait for it.  Wait for it... It really was almost a 10 out of 10.  Just so so good.    Thank you Kings Fish House for bringing Long Island to me and my family. Thank you for making such a beautifully prepared dish.  Thank you for making me smile inside (in my mouth and stomach) and out.    P.S. So I have heard, the meats and pastas are good not great.  So do as the Romans do... When at Kings Fish House, get FISH man!  You'll be glad you did.",

I had the shrimp and scallops with mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese all very good. Could have used a few more scallops on the plate. Dessert was homemade butter cake with homemade vanilla ice cream. My friend had the New Orleans shrimp plate that was good and she had the bread pudding for dessert which she loved. All very good food. Service was good. The food served quickly. Overall nice lunch. Been there 3 times and each time no complaints.",

She suggested their seasonal dish called Cedar Plank Roasted salmon which was just as amazing as her service! This definitely will not be the last time I come into Kings Fish House",

    "text": "Finding a FRESH Seafood Restaurant in Arizona can almost always be a chore so we were delighted when they presented us with a menu printed daily with a great selection of fish - shellfish etc.  We immediately got the party started with a selection of several oyster types harvested from Canada to Mexico and were amazed when they arrived super fresh and prepared correctly.  Very uncommon to get them so fresh without grit or shell pieces.  Without doubt the best we've have had in Arizona.  Im a Clam Chowder fanatic and I cant believe I'm saying this but this place had the best of anything I've tasted on either coast.  The chowder was filled with fresh clams not chunks of potato filler much appreciated!  Seems like we ordered one of everything and all of it was fantastic never experience a fishy smell or taste the entire meal the way fresh fish should be.  Nice atmosphere and a cool little pub area makes this place my favorite Fish House.  Prices are fair for this type of meal possibly a little steep for the Tempe Mall I would imagine they could triple their ROI with a location in North Scottsdale hint hint.  Anyway this place is well worth the 30 minute trip from our home and we will be back again soon.  Forgot to mention they have great craft packets to keep the kids busy at the table better than any other restaurant - our six and eight year old girls loved it.",

The food was great, the service was good, what was wrong?  The sulfuric odor that managed to fill the entire place. Two visits ago I figured they were having a sewage backup problem which seems to be common in Tempe. I gave it a couple weeks and went back with my family. The problem seemed to be a bit worse, we even tried changing tables to see if it would help. No luck.  We mentioned the smell to the waiter, he hesitated nervously and explained that he couldn't smell anything.  I figure I'll give them a few months and try again.",

Having lived on both coasts, I'm always skeptical of going to seafood restaurants in landlocked states, and have actually had some good experiences, but this place was an EPIC FAIL.  It was way overpriced for th quality and quantity of food provided.  We ordered the crab cakes to start, and they were mostly breading.  I didn't even see any crab, just grayish and mushy-looking filling, so I didn't even try it.  My friend ended up sending them back and just got some grilled shrimp instead.  I ordered the Cioppino, which looked and smelled good when it came, but it had several issues.  It was lacking in flavor, the squid and pieces of fish were ridiculously tiny and the crab legs provided were the legs with the least amount of meat.  For $26, I expected to be impressed.  Waste of money!  My friend ordered the salmon and seemed to be pleased with it, but its pretty hard to screw up a simple salmon filet.  I do not recommend this restaurant at all!",

    "text": "We decided to stop in tonight after some shopping at the Tempe Market Place.  We haven't been there in a while and we all felt like seafood, and Kings is our go to sea food place.  I will start off by saying that our server John was very attentive and never had to be reminded of anything.  Very much a plus when you want to have a nice evening.  I ordered something not on the menu and he asked the kitchen if they were able to prepare my scallops the way i like them which is pan seared.  The only thing I suggested after I got them is that they should have been seasoned with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Otherwise they were perfectly cooked, not crowded in the pan which as any cook worth their salt would know that steams scallops and they become rubbery.  These had a great sear on them.  My husband had linguini and clams and he really enjoyed that the clams came out in their shells because he said they were fresh and not canned white clam sauce.  Of course I would be remiss if I did not mention that this is about the only place in Phoenix that you can get sourdough bread that tastes like the piers in San Fransisco.  To finish off our night the manager Miriam came over to ask us how everything was and we were happy to tell her how great the service was and she told us that John had only been there a short time.  I told her they need to keep him because he made the night worth our while as well as the food.  Good job folks keep it up!  We'll be back when it is wild salmon season.",

It was extremely good with plenty of seafood, had a nice favorful taste but not necessarily \"spicy\", but that's our taste and we would most definitely order it again.  Just don't be put off by the \"spicy\" label.  The bread is awesome.  I had the Ahi tuna and my partner had the whaoo.  Perhaps it was simply an off day but the tuna they served me was full of membrane (grizzle).  Out waiter saw the piece after he served it and was very quick to remove and replace it.  The sauce that accompanied it was tasteless and couldn't figure out what it was or suppose to be.  I had to request wasabi which typically always comes with ahi. The garlic mashed potato's were a garlic lovers dream.  Now to the wahoo.  We were surprised to see it offered in the desert as we always order it when on the Yucatan.  If you haven't had the pleasure it is a firm white fish with a distinct taste.  Unfortunately, this piece was overcooked and thus dry.    So perhaps an off day for the kitchen and with that much fresh fish combined with the length of time they have been in operation, we will definitely give it another try.",

They have a lot of oyster and clam options, but I didn't try any as I don't like oysters or clams. The rest of the menu offered some great fish dishes and some steaks, salads and burgers. I opted for the king crab legs, they were hot and tasty. The sides were pretty good, although the garlic potatoes were just a bit on the dry side. Hubby got a Filet mignon. It was grilled perfect, and very good. He wasn't a fan of the cooked spinach side, but everything else was good. He enjoyed the coffee stout, and said it was nice because it didn't have an \"after-bite\" like some of the stouts can.  Our waiter was a 8/10. Although at first he got our drinks and then didn't return to our table for almost 10 minutes, once he came and got out order, he was much more attentive, and came to refill our drinks often. We sat and visited for quite a while, so we were sure to drop some extra tip on the table since we took up one of his booths. Overall, I was pleased with the visit. We will return again.",

We started with the dozen sampler of oysters which was phenomenal. We then had the house salad and the AMAZING sourdough bread and butter. Let me just tell you, I could have had the bread, salad, and oysters and called it a day and been happy. For the main course my girlfriend had the filet and lobster tail and I had the linguini with clams. You simply cannot do better than this. King's is the King.

My friend had the fried combo platter and it was also great. Service was extremely slow and lackluster. Our server was disinterested and inattentive, not filling water glasses, no bread for the table when asked, and order confusion. The wine we ordered tasted old, but we did receive a 2nd glass gratis, thank you!!! I do like the menu here, and will be back. But I will hope for better service.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with our dinner here last evening. Starting with freezer burned bread that was terrible. Our food was tasteless and the worst part was the small flies buzzing around our heads and food. When I mentioned it to our waitress (who was very nice) she acted like it was normal for them to be there. No apologies or can I move you - nothing. There was literally a swarm you could see! Mahi Mahi & Swordfish was over cooked and dry, trout was tasteless. When several flies flew into our wine glasses and we didn't want  to drink them, I complain to the waitress again, who said oh I'm sorry let me get you another one. She literally brought back less wine in the glass than what we lost - guess they didn't want to spoil us.;( Prices reflect expectations of better food and definitely no bugs. Next Call is to health Dept as that can't be acceptable!   Update: I received a call from the General Manager of this Restaurant who actually read my review and called me to apologize. She said they used my feedback in their training seminar to ensure this would never happen again. I must say, I was impressed with her sincerity and willingness to improve their service.  Thus I've adjusted my review because it's not how you fall - but how you get up!  Thank you for caring. I'll be back.",

I got there a little early so was able to find open seating in the bar area (which was a nice sized booth that comfortably fit four) and the waiter/bartender was very nice.  We had wine and beer, then ordered two types of oysters on the half shell.  They were INCREDIBLE!  I had not had them before so I wasn't sure how I would like it, but I LOVED them.  At the recommendation of the server, we got the Kumamota and the Black Duck Salts.  Served w fresh horseradish, cocktail sauce, a white wine sauce, and a new mango habanero (DELISH) and they were OUTstanding.  Also had the edamame (salted) which was good.    For dinner we tried: blackened swordfish, Parmesan crusted ono, grilled ono, and fish and chips which the waitress said were the best she has ever had.  They were good, it was all good!!  I highly recommend the Parmesan crusted ono and the blackened swordfish!!  The Brussels sprouts are good, too!!    We finished off w a shared Jack Daniels Bread Pudding.  I would go back weekly just for the oysters and the bread pudding!!  (Okay, and the Wine of course)   Try it out if you're in the Tempe Marketplace area",

The food was a hit and miss and took rather long, but it was understandable. My wife and I would like to go again on a day when they aren't so busy.

We were not checked on or updated and actually saw our food sitting on the kitchen counter in the back ready to be picked up for some time. Forgot basic condiment requests as well... This was a Tuesday night and only one waiter was working 6 packed tables which was clearly insufficient. Fish was greasy as hell for the fish and chips and chicken tenders were super over cooked.

It was terribly overcooked and the sauce was far too sweet. This should be a firm and flaky type of fish. I usually catch, clean and cook my own. This piece of fish was mushy and had no flavor. I took 3 bites and did not eat the rest THANK GOD. This was the only meal I had eaten yesterday. At about noon today I had the worst stomach cramps and issues that I don't want to get into detail over - food poisoning. I called to speak to the manager and she was conveniently \"on the phone with a customer\" the lady who answered the phone did not offer to take my number for her to call me back.  Do not eat the fish here guys- it's not worth trying to work and run to the bathroom every 20 minutes.   Needless to say I will not be returning and I will be letting everyone I know about how sick this food made me.",

Our waitress Timber was probably one of the best and most knowledgeable waitresses I've had in a long time. She knew the menu and offered good suggestions. The food was wonderful my guest and I had the mussels and then had the surf and turf. Everything was cooked well and was flavorful. Timber was attentive and checked in on us at the appropriate times and just overall wow'd us on service. Great place, great food, great service.",

I love the ambiance here, the oysters are top notch (Texas, you need to visit here and learn what a freaking good oyster is), the fries are good, the warm bread is awesome.  They could use some better brews on tap -- good seafood calls for a good beer (e.g. pale ale).  The service was really good, fast, friendly (unlike Hertz).  My first visit, I also had the soft-shell crab. Being from the DC area, I get these whenever I can find them, and King's' was perfect.",

Having been to Alaska numerous times (my son lives there /USMC), the halibut was as good as we have had up there.  I had requested some flowers for my wife and the restaurant provided her with lovely roses.  Thank you Kings Fish House for making our Valentines dinner very special.  We definately will dine there again during our 2 month stay in Phoenix.",

I ordered the three oyster shooters first. They came with grated horseradish on top--it is NOT cheese!  So I stirred that into the shooter and shot it. Oh so good!!!  For my entree I ordered the Wild Jumbo Shrimp and Lump Crab Meat Salad.  The shrimp and crab were really good, but I was surprised to see chunks of carrots and celery--the celery appearing to be the dry ends of the stalk which I gently removed.  How weird to have big pieces of carrots and celery on what I considered to be a shrimp and crab Louie.  It was good, but I (obviously) was a little too hung up with these other two items to really enjoy it.  Service was nothing outstanding which is typical by today's standard.  I'll go back, but I'll tell them to leave the celery and carrots off.",

I enjoyed my trout and tried my friend's halibut and her mom's Alaskan Sanddab. Both were equally delicious. We finished our meal with key lime pie and creme brulee.

The scallops were cooked perfectly and the grilled zucchini was especially nice with a seasoning that I was not typical in other places that I have been. I also had the mac n cheese and it was obvious that it was freshly made. My client said that she really enjoyed her burger and sweet potato fries also.

    "text": "An upgrade to five stars is necessary after weekly fish lunches for the past several months.  I have managed to cycle thru the various seasonal \"wild\" salmon plus a portion of the other fish.  For me it is hard not to order salmon but will be forced to make a change in the fall at the end of the season.  Today was the Wild Kuskokwim River Coho Salmon summer salad with asparagus, tomatoes, blue cheese and fennel in an orange-soy vinaigrette.  An excellent recommendation by the waitress versus my standard cedar plank roasted salmon that masks the rich mild salmon flavor.  This time simply grilled and very, very tasty.  What I am really beginning to like about King's Fish House is excellent service in the center section under my favorite fish.  The mighty AK Chinook King Salmon...I remember catching a similar King 20 years ago on the Kenai River in AK.  My dad and I each caught Kenai King Salmon on separate days.  Each fish was 42 inches long but mine had 27 inch girth and my dad's fish had a 26 inch girth.  The scale was broken so never knew what they actually weighed (40 to 45 #).  My dad claimed his fish was larger so there you go.  The photo of us holding the fish at sunset with a background river shot is proof of their size but not of their quality.  As I recall they were the best tasting fish ever but 20 years is a long time to try to remember taste.  As far as service goes either waitress knows that I start with a Kiltlifter  but not the size - sometimes 16 oz and sometimes 22 oz.  Both waitresses know I like salmon but if the same type of salmon is on the menu I have switched to sea bass or rock fish.  Hard to believe but sometimes change is good but I almost always remember to go back to salmon the next time.",

I hope to have a nice meal there soon...like it was when they first opened and had me hooked (no pun). So 10/21/14 I went back for LUNCH at the bar  and I had oysters, fish and chips that was fresh and fluffy and paired it with a tasty craft IPA. Seriously, the raw bar is excellent, and the food is good, service was slow, but very pleasant as they checked in after lunch was served.  I did not see any new sides of the menu yet, but I was told they were coming so I just had tavern fare. The restaurant did really try to accommodate the lousy experience I had with the previous review.  What else can you ask for really? This is a real fish restaurant in Tempe aiming to please.",

    "text": "I agree with Alicia, it is a bit pricey here, even for a place nowhere near a fish producing body of water. Back home Cioppino might cost you a little less, even at the classiest place, however I will say its pretty good, but I'd have to wait until I become a millionaire to try it again to indicate any authenticity.   I was just here with a classmate about two weeks ago, and I must say, I was kinda disappointed. I ordered the fried oysters ($16+; I got like 5 small oysters with some fries and cole slaw) which I asked to be fried \"hard\" which I think the cook mistook my request  and thought I wanted to be served the most dried out oysters I have ever had in my life. Our waitress was alright, but she was very slow for a restaurant with only 5 other tables. I don't really appreciate being left vulnerable to choking without a drink to counter it.    I think my first visit here was the best. The oysters, which we got as a appetizer and not a meal, came out great (even with my hard-frying request), the sourdough bread almost sparked memories of bread from home. And the Cioppino was delicious, but the bowl was very shallow and didn't get me messy at all! The bib isn't suppose to be for looks!! Haha, I'm joking with you slightly, but I always remember making much more of a mess with the soup back home. And our waiter was great, very knowledgeable on the dishes and drinks and was charming. I think I enjoyed sitting in the bar section much more than the general dining area.  If I had been able to type up this review after my first visit, King's probably would have gotten 5-stars from me, but blame the dry-ass oysters and the inability for our waitress to not fill my ice tea glass up quick enough to make me give King's Fish House a 3.",

We took a look at the dessert menu but decided we were too full to have dessert. We will definitely be back.",

However, my oysters on the half shell were small and served with some weird shaved horseradish, my steamed shrimp was rather boring, and my wife disliked her fish so much that she couldn't finish it and asked for it to be sent back.  She said it was over-cooked and flavorless.  To be fair to the staff, the waitress and chef both came out to our table and offered to re-cook the fish or make something else entirely for her, but by then, my wife was too turned off to have anything else.  I would never try King's Fish House again.  For a guy originally from Maryland who's had some pretty amazing seafood, there was just too much wrong here to be given a second chance.  For what it's worth, my brother-in-law had the New England clam chowder that night with us and said it was the best he had ever had.",

Accidently walking in the bar side entrance we were pleasantly greeted and suggested to sit wherever we would like. Choosing a spacious private seating area offside the bar and restaurant allowed us to enjoy ourselves with tons of room to spread out and without the worry of disturbing others with loud laughter. A refreshing Desert Pear Margarita for happy hour made it hard to have just one! We ordered a great Coho Salmon dish which was fresh, juicy, and seasoned wonderfully and an awesome Lobster Crunch Roll as well. Friendly service from Paul the manager and Anthony the bartender; loved the special touch of meeting the chef tableside too!",

    "text": "Overpriced is the first word that comes to mind.  And the word that dominates my feelings toward this place.  They never mentioned that the \"KING\" in the name actually  means you have to be as RICH as a REAL KING to afford to eat here.  $13.95 for a ( relatively forgettable ) simple oyster Po' Boy with 5 oysters on it and a side of fries?   Yep.  Who's dumber - me for paying it, or them for charging it?  I think Me.  When I saw the price, I should have just closed the menu and left.  I also had a $6.95 \"Cajun Bloody Mary\" which had nothing Cajun about it, as far as I could tell.  It was mostly ice, served in a 16-oz glass.  So maybe about 6 ounces of \"drink material\" inside.  It lasted about as long as it took me to take 5 drinks out of it.  Let's do the math:  At $6.95, with 6 ounces of substance, that comes to $148.26 per gallon.    So at least I can say I had a Bloody Mary which came in at around $148 a gallon.  I will never, EVER go back to that place.  And if you do go, bring the credit card with the highest available balance, because you are gonna need it.  P.S.  A manager attempted to contact me after seeing this review, trying to make things right for me.  I understand their prices reflect the \"going rate\" for fresh seafood in the desert.  I've upped the star from 1 to 2 to reflect the respect for management for trying to contact me and make things right.  Kudos for that.  P.S.P.S.  I had Pete's Fish and Chips the other day, and I realized that their fried oysters are the EXACT SAME ONES which are served at King's Fish House.  So if you want to know what these fried oysters taste like, eat at Pete's.  You can get about 15 oysters there for the King's price.",

Prices went up from there for the various fish dishes, but I can't really judge those without trying them.  I've got no complaints, and I'd probably go back if I'm with people that want to go, but I think I can find similar quality food for me at about 4 or 5 dollars less for lunch.",

Their menu offers a huge variety including fresh oysters, a nice selection of salads, and lobster. And for the non fish eater, there are sandwiches, chicken, pasta and steaks.

I ate three bites but could not stomach it anymore. We waited for the server to come ask us how it was (usually they do that) but he never bothered to ask and barely even stopped at our table again. You think he would have noticed the barely touched fish on my plate. The fries were also over cooked and the Mac and cheese wasn't good either. We took the leftovers home intending to give it to the dogs and not waste it. But on the way home we both started feeling queasy. He ate more than I did so he felt it more, I'm pretty sure it gave us a small dose of food poisoning, but thankfully we didn't eat much of it. We decided to throw it all away instead of getting the dogs sick as well. We will not be returning to this establishment.",

I expected that I would get nice large shrimp only it was a pile of tiny cold, boring shrimp on top of a plate full of lettuce with large hunks of unseasoned raw veggies. I took a few bites and then just stopped eating it. I am a person that loves salads, they can be made healthy and flavorful when done well, but this one is something I could have thrown together at home myself. When our server saw my salad not eaten, he simply asked if I was finished but didn't even ask if I enjoyed it. Clearly I did not enjoy it since I took only 3 or 4 bites.  My boyfriend ordered the smoked salmon tortellini which actually tasted fine, however the price was high and there was only a small amount of salmon in the dish. It was more of a pasta with cream sauce and a little bit of salmon thrown in for flavor. We each had one drink from the bar and the bill came to $50.00.  The best thing here was the sourdough bread, however I expected them to ask if we wanted more bread after we finished the first piece on our table and they did not ask if we wanted more. Personally I don't mind not getting more bread because I don't like to overeat it, however I think they should at least ask if we would like more. Overall, the food was so-so but the main thing is that the prices were shockingly high for the quality of the food we received. In my opinion the food, atmosphere, and service was not worth it.",

    "text": "King's Fish House is a chain restaurant.  Not as big as McCormick & Schmick's.  They have locations in CA, NV, and AZ for now.  It's located in the Tempe Marketplace which is always super busy but that's not a problem.  Actually the first time we went to King's Fish House, we liked it so much we decided to come back again the next day!  The seafood here is GREAT!  It's so hard to find a place for good seafood.  I actually prefer King's Fish House more than McCormick & Schmick's!  They have something for everyone even if you're not in to seafood.  But if you are they even have sandwiches, sushi, oyster platters, and pasta.  I learned from my first time here that their portion sizes are pretty big, so when we came back a second time we shared one of the plates haha.  Well we shared our sides, we each got our own plates.  Also the calamari is a good choice for appetizers!    The restaurant overall is not too bad.  We came here in a group of 8 and they easily accommodated us last minute.   And our server was on top of everything with orders, drinks, knowing who got what.  Great customer service!  Also they sometimes have good deals where you buy their giftcard and a bonus gift card.",

Second, there have been a few new items added to the including a butter cake that will remind you of the St. Louis Gooey Butter Cake.

    "text": "Gonna Have To Do 3 Stars.     After earning our meal by doing a few miles of fast paced hiking over at Papago Park earlier in the evening, my wife & I decided to check out King's which, for some reason neither of us can remember, we both already had bookmarked on Yelp.  We were in the mood for seafood and had some cod at home ready to be prepared, but decided we were hangry enough to just jet over to King's to spend what ended up being $150 for a mediocre dinner.  While we always enjoy each other's company when out and about, kind of wish we had just gone home.    Started with the Oysters Rockefeller, which was tasty.   Everybody seems to do Rockefeller differently, and King's prepares it with what I think is sort of Hollandaise sauce on top.  I liked it.    I then had the King's Spicy Seafood Chowder which was awesome and hearty.  One could do a bowl of that and a salad and call it a meal, honestly.  Very good.    I then had the \"Fish House Favorite\" Macadamia Nut Encrusted Alaskan Halibut.  It was done nicely, and was a truly ample portion of Halibut.   But there was no evidence of an \"orange ginger butter sauce\" and I'm not really sure how to describe the flavor other than just sort of \"blah\".   Not impressive, especially at $31.  On the other hand, the dish came with two sides, so I had garlic mashed potatoes and mac&cheese.  These sides were both delicious - they do a really nice job with these two sides and the portions of both were also ample.    I try to keep Yelp reviews limited to my food / my experience and not that of other people in my party, however, I have to factor my wife's experience into this one.   She ordered the Filet Mignon (med-rare) and South African Lobster Tail combo.   Her lobster tail was huge and delicious, but her filet was overcooked and I think it was a bad cut of meat in general as it was extremely dry even though it looked like it was a solid medium in the middle.  Per the restaurant policy, they \"unconditionally guarantee their product\", so upon pointing out that the steak was overdone, our server immediately offered to have a fresh cut prepared.    It was better, med-rare in the middle but still overdone closer to the edges -- but at least much more juicy throughout than the first cut.   To her further chagrin, she also found that her large baked potato was raw in the middle.  She did not send it back or mention it because by this time we were basically done with our meal.   I had a single beer from one of my favorite breweries -- North Coast Brewing Scrimshaw Pilsner -- something that's not common here in the valley, and she had a glass of the Nielsen Pinot.   So, the good -- Oysters, the chowder, my sides, her lobster, our drinks. The not so good -- my entree, her filet, part of her side, and the cost of our all-told mediocre meal.",

The restaurant was clean, it didn't take long for our server to greet us,  take our drink order and offered us bread (it was so good).  What we really appreciated is the Manager of the restaurant stopped at our table after we received our food to introduce herself, make sure we were happy with what we ordered and we were. We have been to several restaurants and that is not common but it was appreciated. We did notice she did this with other tables and thought it was pretty awesome.  The food was great, from the appetizers to the desert. Some of our favorites were their ahi poke appetizer, avocado toast, Salmon, old fashion drink, and the bread pudding.   On our next trip a few months later, we decided to go back again and sat in their bar area, the 2nd visit was just as great. This time another Manager stopped at our table. We took the opportunity to ask if that was common, he said yes. Their company is all about making sure those that dine at their restaurant are happy (he used a term I can't remember). We told him we thought it was great.   Thank you King's Fish House for giving us a couple of great visits, we look forward to our return!",

We ordered ceviche for an appetizer.  The portion was great for four. Unfortunately, it was fishy, like the fish was old. It lacked citrus and salt.  The \"Fish & Chips\" came with shoe string potatoes cooked in old ....fishy oil.  I could smell them before I got them to my mouth, ewh! The fish coating, also cooked in the aforementioned old oil was also pungent with the smell and to add insult to injury, the batter was chewy, not crispy.  I had to strip away my favorite part to be left with some \"meh\" fish.   We were a party of four, so other had entree with similar reviews.  I can't find a silver lining in any of it. Food was bad, service was average and nothing makes me madder than over paying for bad food.",

The east coasts are much sweeter and to my taste much better! But they explain it all to you which makes it very fun. Hard to find so many different oysters any place else in the valley.

It was very busy on the Saturday night we went, so instead of sitting out the one hour wait we decided on eating at the bar.  The fish was terrific and fresh--I understand it's shipped in same day from Los Angeles.  I felt the \"chips\" part of the Fish and Chips were kinda lame given the price of the meal.  Also, occasionally a really nasty odor wafted in--I think maybe a sewer smell from outdoors coming in through the open windows.  That only happened a couple of times & I wouldn't expect that to be the general experience for people eating here.  Altogether a good eating experience.",

However, my friend invited some of us to stop by here Friday to celebrate her just-received and hard-earned master's degree from ASU. So I went. We ate in the oyster bar area. The place is really cute. Sure, it looks kind of corporate, but in a nice way. It's definitely the kind of place I would want to stop by for drinks with my friends. The wine list was OK, and they had some nice sake and martinis. Our waitress was great and really friendly.  The seafood platter they ordered smelled good.. and everyone who ate it said it was tasty. It's definitely a bit pricey, but if the seafood is really that fresh, I guess it's worth it.  I'll probably bring my parents here when they visit and then I'll try something off the menu. The choices (aside from the sushi and seafood platters) range from pricey things like $20+  for the trout or the macadamia-nut crusted halibut to $12 tuna melts.  In the meantime, I have a good opinion of this place. Oh, and it's actually in the parking lot area of Tempe Marketplace, not in that annoying pedestrian part dubbed \"The District.\" So that earns it some points, too.",

    "text": "It's rare that I take the time to write a review but my experience here was so bad I felt compelled to alert anyone who is considering dining here.   My husband and I had a night out and were looking forward to good food and conversation-we had spotted this seafood restaurant and thought we would give it a try. We went in and immediately it was clear that we just seated ourselves. Then a friendly waiter came by and took our drink order. However, it was at least 15 minutes until the drinks returned.   Looking over the menu, we quickly realized that it was more expensive than anticipated (most dishes running between $15.00-30.00) But we rationalized that it's worth paying the difference for quality seafood. So, we placed our orders.  When the food came out and we glimpsed the plates-immediately we were concerned. The presentation was awful and the portions small. My meal consisted of overcooked Talipia, with a small, sad pile of potatoes and coleslaw. I don't consider myself much of a cook but I can tell you that I've made far better fish and potatoes at home. My husband took one bite of his shrimp and pushed the plate away. His shrrimp, also overcooked, was completely unappealing and repulsive.   We discussed the situation and both decided the last thing we wanted to do was spend roughly $70.00 on a horrible meal. We agreed that we'd had far better at Red Lobster. The price rivaled one of my favorite seafood restaurants The Chart House (where I can guarantee you, you won't be disappointed).   We flagged the waiter and asked him to remove the meals from our ticket and that we'd go elsewhere for dinner. Something my husband and I had never, ever done before.   The one good thing I can say, is that both the waiter (and the Manager who came by) were very apologetic and accomodating. They were the one bright spot in a truly awful experience.",

Let's face it, we did NOT go for the salad anyway. I ordered the Parmesan crusted Sand Dabs with my two choices as garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. My Sand Dabs were fabulous! I had only had them one other time at McCormick & Schmicks and I think these were just a tad bit better. They were perfectly fried. I must admit the sides were a tad bit lacking. My husband ordered the Mexican coconut shrimp and they were quite good as well. Mom's boyfriend ordered Halibut Almondine and was in love at first bite. My mom had a salmon dish and she was also quite pleased with her choice. Now. I can over look the standard salad and the slightly ordinary sides but this place gets -1 solid star for the dessert. I ordered creme brule... one of my favorites. It tasted like it was from a box. A standard custard... Blech! I held out on dessert every other night we went out to dinner and this place was quite a disappointment. Now on the other hand my husband and mom both devoured their bread pudding with out complaint and the mom's boyfriend claimed his key lime pie was only second to one and that's saying A LOT.   Now. This place COULD have been 3 stars but they got the bump up for the following reasons:  -Fresh fish flown in with menus printed daily  -I caught a buzz off two martinis.  -We were all happy with our selections which is quite a feat.   Should have been 3 stars because:  -price is on the higher side... I'd rather go to McCormick & Schmicks for the price  -crappy desserts.   I admit I am a little surprised to see some of the reviews at 1 or 2 stars. We had great service and our food came out in a timely manner, as did our drinks.",

The waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu and wasn't able to offer really good advice. He just would say everything was \"really good.\" He also seemed to take occasional smoke breaks, because he would come back to our table wreaking of cigarettes and stink up the whole area. It was extremely unappetizing to smell that odor throughout our dinner. Every time he'd come back to the table, the smell of like wet musty cigs just kind of lingered in the air and my husband and I would look at each other. In addition to that, the food was bland. I ordered steamed mussels and they really didn't offer any kind of good broth. I also ordered a white fish off their most popular menu thinking that I couldn't go wrong and it was completely bland. My husband thought his meal was decent. We both agreed we would never go back to King's Fish House when we want to eat a nice seafood meal.",

I was kinda impressed cuz we've called other restaraunts and they have turned us down in the same senario.... when we sat down, we ordered right away, it took awhile for us to get our food, i finally had to flag our waitress down and ask her to bring whatever was ready whenever it was ready. My salad was probably the best thing I had that night next to the water. Come on tho, how hard is it to mess up salad and a water! My Dad had the trout, he finished it but said it wasnt the best, my Mom had the Chicken Parmesean. She picked around the stuff she didn't like. I ordered a coconut shrimp apetizer, it arrived cold. The bill for two adult entrees and one appetizer a small ceaser salad and one childs meal was $80....  we still tipped $20, but $100 for one of the worst meals in a long time wasn't worth it. We won't be back at least for awhile.",

    "text": "On our first trip to Tempe Marketplace we decided to dine at King's Fish House as me and my wife rarely get to eat fish with an 8 year old in tow, but their kids menu seemed adequate, so we decided to say.  We started with the Clam Chowder which was flavorful, but the portion was small, which turned out to be a theme throughout the night.  My wife and I split the Blackened Mahi Mahi with Mango salsa along with Jasmine rice and Glazed carrots. I won't argue with the price of a good meal, but our portions were really small for the price. The rice had only a hit of Jasmine, and the carrots were underdone. The fish was very good, but again I was put off by the portion size.  For dessert we had Strawberry Shortcake, and while the \"cake\" was good, size was again a problem as the shortcake wasn't much larger than a half-dollar.  Our waiter was inattentive as we had to ask for drinks and bread several times, and he didn't seem very knowledgeable about the menu.  Overall the food was good, but there was nothing special about the experience at all, and there is not much value based on the portion size. I would not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Just put this place out of its misery and close it down. I mean, I'll give it 2 stars for the food which wasn't terrible but definitely forgettable. My husband, daughter, and I went when the restaurant was practically empty on July 18th between 2 and 4 pm. It was my birthday. We sat in the bar area. We were definitely seated in an area where a shift change occurred as our appetizer orders were taken by a woman and a man ended up taking our entree and dessert orders. Everything took very long and there was literally 1 other table in the restaurant besides us. Both waiters were exceptionally uninterested in giving us even decent service. I hate having to leave a tip for people who don't really do anything and you almost get the feeling that they want you to leave. Nevertheless, I left a tip to keep some sort of strange dignity for the black community which I am going to stop doing. People are just going to have to think black people don't tip because I just think it's unfair to have to continually tip people for giving poor service. Even so, I don't think it was a race thing, I just think it was a genuine IDGAF thing. These days, it's like people think you owe them everything, as if being polite is some sort of task or strenuous chore. They expect so much but give so little. You're not feeding animals at a zoo, you're feeding people. That's how I tried to think when I waited tables. I always asked people what brought them in today, tried to find out if it was someone's birthday, if they were celebrating an anniversary or some other special occasion. That's really basic stuff, some people will be rude and not want to be bothered, wait on them accordingly, but give everyone who walks through the door a clean slate for a good experience. It will not go unnoticed.",

I prefer the bigger ones personally.  Next were the Blackened Shrimp Taquitos. These were tasty. Good flavor and crunch. The Baked Penn Cove Mussels are a must. A different twist on traditional baked mussels.   We decided to venture into sashimi and a roll.  The sashimi was average at best.  The Lobster Crunchy Roll was a score! We went back to shrimp with the N'awlin's BBQ Shrimp. The shrimp was good but the real treat to this dish is to dunk the bread into the sauce and then place the tomatoes on the bread similar to bruschetta. That was a home run!  Don't forget the Butter Cake!!",

I remembered the first time I wasn't really disappointed but really wasn't impressed; especially with the portion size for the price. Time has gone by and Jen and I figured why not try it again.   Jen ordered the Barcat Oysters and really liked them. We also ordered Crab Cakes as appetizers. I was a little disappointed in the Crab Cakes.  Breaded and fried like typical cakes. they were good and the sauce accompanying them was also good. Unfortunately, all crab cakes we eat will be compared to the cakes we had in Sedona at Creekside (see my review and pics).  That was at a breakfast type restaurant and you would think a place with Fish House as part of it's name would be able to blow you away with their version. $12 and the portion size also was lackluster.  For entrees Jen order the Yellowtail Carpaccio and I ordered the Sea Scallops.  Jen said it was ok. The mash potatoes as one of my sides and.was very gritty which means they were overcooked.  The Mac and Cheese was, well, Mac and cheese. They do sprinkle it with panko breading which I like cause it gives a nice crunch. Portion size on the scallops was ok but they were a little small for sea scallops; quantity of 8.  They were good but a little overcooked on one side to the other.  I told Jen were just going to Costco for seafood from now on because we can't find a REALLY good seafood place around Phoenix.   Bill was $75 and for what we got was too high. We ate at The Keg on Chandler Blvd. a week ago and both had prime rib and a scallops app and it was $10 less.  I don't mind paying top dollar for good food and service but I want to get what I pay for.  On a final note, our server Korey was really friendly and very helpful when I asked questions about menu items.  He was also very attentive and probably the only highlight of our experience there.",

Managers are open to take customers' opinions into consideration, and I found it very proficient and adequate.   As stated in my previous review, I will draft another updated review based on my last visit for lunch at this place, and also for the invitation of the management team. This time, after jumbling through the menu once again for a closer look. I decided to go for Rainbow Trout Amandine with mango salsa, plus 2 sides of sauteed spinach and grilled zucchini.  At this moment, I am impressed. The trout is crunchy from the outside, but it also contains enough moisture. The garlic sauce (you can find it on the table) and the main entree is a perfect combination together. However, the sauteed spinach is just not my taste. The sourdough bread is fresh baked, and I prefer to enjoy it with sugar and butter on top.   Once you know what to order, you can't go wrong with the your selection. They rotate the lunch menu every week, so each day they will have different specialties. Overall, my experience was improved this time. Thanks King's for the hospitality.",

The bun was perfectly toasted and sliced to create a pocket filled with a generous heap of warm and delicious chunks of lobster. We also had the grilled wild jumbo shrimp plate paired with asparagus which were both cooked perfectly. The fries, mac n cheese and cole slaw were your standard sides.  The restaurant itself was nice and spacious. They brought a sling for our little one's car seat so he could rest while we had dinner. Wonderful service! Will definitely return for future seafood meals!",

We entered by the bar (later realizing that wasn't the main entrance) and navigated to the front before we were greeted. We were quickly seated and waited for our server. The restaurant was quite empty on a weekday night but we didn't mind at all. A pretty large menu full of seafood options left me completely indecisive. Our server greeted was friendly and gave us time to go through the menu before we ordered. I opted for the Trinidad Swizzle cocktail, shared the King's Crab Cakes for appetizer, and chose the Farmed Idaho Trout Amandine with a side of spinach and a baked potato for my entree.   It took a while for our food to come out, enough for us to keep looking in the direction of the kitchen hoping our food was on the next tray out. The rum-based cocktail was great, and the crab cakes had good flavor despite a mushy. I was a little underwhelmed by the entree; although it looked good and was filling, I found it didn't have much flavor to me and was a bit bland.   The service was still nice and I'd be willing to try something else on the menu next time; hopefully something with a bit more flavor and pizzazz to it.",

The service was great. I ordered the N'awlins Jumbo BBQ Shrimp which wasn't really BBQ but more of spicy tomato based sauce. It came with Jasmin rice but my waiter recommended subbing the rice for the mashed potatoes to help offset the spiciness.   I was pleasantly surprised at just how generous they were with the jumbo shrimp.. there were 12 jumbo shrimp in my dish! Most places do not give you that many. The mashed potatoes were divine.  My boyfriend ordered the herb chicken with mashed potatoes and also enjoyed it. I would definitely come back!",

The food is still blah... no flavor or way too battered... but Lorie(our server) was great and tried to make up for the food.   My husband had the Cioppino which was ok. The snow crabs were tiny and not cracked, other seafoods were so small it got lost in the broth. I had the King's Combo Platter which was ok. Fish was way too battered and 2 pieces of over fried shrimp and 2 halves of scallops were over cooked. A friend had the Clam Linguini which had no flavor. Another friend had the Halibut which she was excited to try, unfortunately she had to ask for sauce for it to be decent. Kids ordered the Kids shrimp plate... 3 pieces of over cooked shrimp and some fries. But at least the calamari was great this time! The Brussel Sprouts were great too. Fortunately the company and service made up for the food which was over priced(our bill was over $300) and over cooked.",

We ordered a dozen various oysters, and for dinner we both ordered the king crab. Phenomenal. My daughter ordered the fried shrimp and it was also delicious. The server even brought out one of the live lobsters for my daughter to touch and look at.   All in all, a really good experience with good food. My only gripe is that the oysters were SUPER overpriced and so was my drink.",

Probably will not order the scallops again or suggest them. The garlic mashed potatoes were as good as ever as was the grilled zucchini. In addition the Parmesan Crusted Sand Dabs were a hit. The flavor and sauce complimented by the garlic mashed potatoes were next level. For those that like fish I would definitely recommend the dish, has True flavor.",

Crab was almost impossible to crack the shell and the meat was soggy once I fought my way in.  Shrimp arrived with head and legs still on.  Once I fought my way in the shrimp was not only tough but they were soggy too.  The only reason this is not a one star is my wife and our friends had better luck.  Wife had fresh halibut and it was very good.  The other couple had trout and the other Alaskan Sand Dabs.  Both reported excellent also.  I tasted the Sand Dabs and would order those next time.  Restaurants that have Cioppino on their menu need to know people ordering it are people with high expectations and need to go high quality or take it off your menu.  If you are on the hunt for excellent Cioppino thy Avanti in Phoenix.  Update: GM Michelle reached out and asked for a second chance. We had dinner there again Sat night.  All is well.  I had the Sand Dabs this time (3 of us did).  They were amazing.  Service was excellent.  Thanks Michelle for reaching out.",

    "text": "I've been to King's Fish House three times over the past two years - the food is always amazing and atmosphere is perfect in the middle of the day on a weekend.   Today our server was Brandon; he was very good. A little scarce, but we weren't in a hurry, as it was my husband's birthday.   At the table we ordered these items:  1. Ono (fish) - excellent, five stars. Comes with two sides, and all the sides are good; you can't go wrong.  2. Fish & Chips -- their Cod is as good as it gets. This was fabulous, which made me glad because it's what my husband ordered for his birthday.  3. Cheeseburger - very good; my daughter couldn't even finish it all, likely because she scarfed down so much of the fantastic sourdough table bread.  4. Tuna Melt sandwich - the sandwich itself (bread and fixings) were perfect, but the Tuna (it's pieces of a tuna steak) was very dry. I eventually took most the fish out of the sandwich and it was very good. Unfortunately, I would not order it again because of the dry, though good-flavored tuna. Maybe they should consider making it a tuna-salad kind of tuna melt? 5. I ordered a cup of the New England clam chowder and it was out of this world. Best I've had in a super-long time. I could have had only the clam chowder and the bread and I would have been in hog-heaven.  6. We received a free dessert for my husband's birthday and another free dessert because a ramekin of ketchup was spilled all over the seat and floor as my food was being delivered to me (I had white shorts on but thankfully it hit the bench, not me-phew). She was super-apologetic and wiped it up thoroughly. Not sure if she was a hostess or the manager.     These things do sometimes happen - no points off for that. The manager gave us another free desert for the Ketchup issue. Sooo... although we were stuffed, the four of us managed to eat both desserts. They were very delicious as well as appealing to the eyes. Yum - creme brulee and a very chocolatey piece of cake. Both were excellent and the creme brulee was a good size - not skimpy unlike how some restaurants bring a tiny little creme brulee. I would certainly get the creme brulee again in a heartbeat. 6. The bathrooms weren't in the best working order. They looked great when you walk in - nicely decorated like the rest of the restaurant. However, in the ladies' room, the lock on the handicapped stall doesn't work. Hard to believe that they haven't fixed that. The sliding lock doesn't match up with the hole on the doorframe. I used it without locking and hoped for the best.    One of the sinks, the closest to the door, has a faucet that is about 1/5th or 1/6th corroded where it has been eaten away by calcium or some other chemical. On the same sink, the soap pumper is loose and barely works. Weird. Here's hoping they will fix these items in short order. All three toilets are kind of low-flow and they don't flush everything down very well, even after 2-3 flushes.      We will certainly be back when we have another special occasion. You should consider it too - lots of sushi and sushi roll options, fabulous-sounding salads, plentiful fish, shrimp and crab options, interesting pastas, and hamburgers for those who just have to have their beef. Reservations are recommended.",

The clam chowder was also very good. $8.50/bowl. For our meals we each had the sea bass. Which was only about $20, so not unreasonable. The portion was decent and the Brussels sprouts and kale sides were very good. BUT.. the sea bass was overcooked and not tender. The flavor was ok, but the texture just didn't melt in your mouth or cut like butter. It felt more like pollock due to the overcooking.",

Ordered scallops and paid $25.00 for them. 8 1\" fishy tasting. Worst scallops ever, especially for the price. We ordered a bottle of wine and Cody put in a bucket at the end of our table. Not once did he come back and pour for us. Very sub-par for the money. Won't return!",

    "text": "My wife and I have dined at this chain's Long Beach, CA location as well as the Tempe, AZ location.  Based on those previous experiences we chose the Tempe location as the place we wanted to dine on our 45th wedding anniversary.  Based on this most recent experience I don't think we will be back.  First, we were both disappointed with the portion size.  My wife ordered the grilled catfish and she was served 4-5 ounces of fish.  Normally, one would think in terms of an 8 oz portion, especially catfish, which is one of the more common of fish.  She thought it tasted OK, but just OK, nothing special.  I ordered the ono, one of my favorite pacific fish, and I also got about a  5 ounce portion.  It was good, but nothing special.  The catfish was $17.50 and the ono was $20.75.  Very skimpy portions for the price.  There is a $1.50 extra charge of you want asparagus.  That's a little high given that most grocery stores sell it for about that much per pound in season.  My wife got about 6 stalks.  For sides I chose mac and cheese and the corn.  I got mashed potatoes and corn.  The mac and cheese was promptly brought out when I noted the problem.  It was good, but you only got about 4 ounces.  The corn was so loaded with silk that it was barely edible.  My wife said her mashed potatoes were good.  The wine list was standard, nothing outstanding.  Prices for wine were average$7.50 - $11.00 per glass for most choices.  Service was OK, but just OK.  The waiter did not seemed impressed with our response to his questions that we were celebrating our 45th anniversary.   \"Cool.  I've been married ten years,\" he responded (at leasat he didn't say \"Awesome.\").  Good for him.  He never asked if we wanted a second glass of wine, which cut his tip, of course.  He did come back once to ask if everything was OK.  My wife questioned the size of her portion, but he just said that that was what the kitchen prepared.  Tip and tax put us over $80 for just a so-so meal.  I could not recommend this restaurant.",

So we were excited to learn of the Kings Fish House and the wonderful menu. We decided to try dinner last Saturday and to make a long story short, we were disappointed.   We rate restaurants for our overall experience, not just the food. And unfortunately, this place delivered neither. Our server, to put it mildly, was very curt and not helpful with understanding the menu. It seemed like we were a bother to him, eating at his station. Awful service. Now to the meals...everything was was over cooked...for a seafood restaurant, you would figure they would know how to cook it...not the case. It was a shame to have over cooked clams, King Crab legs and lobster...chewy, ALL of it. Even the rice was over cooked...really?! Again, too bad...giving this place 1 star for convenience of location....that's it.",

I ordered the fish with the side of mac. and the oyster sampler. The oysters were good but way over priced for the 8. My food got there at last and the fish was around a 3 oz portion which the waitress pointed out that I had a bigger portion coming! Why the hell would they even send it out if it wasn't right? I at my two bites of fish and while I was waiting for the rest of my missing fish I try ed the mac. I was old and dried out. I sent it and they brought me another portion that was nearly as bad. By this time my wife was finished with her food and I still waited.I finely got the attention of one of the wait staff (I hadn't seen my waitress for a while) and asked when the rest of my fish was coming? No one knew what I was yalking about. They hunted down my waitress, the girl who brought me the skimpy order and the manager. By the time it was all straightened out we were ready to leave. They comped the fish but for the burger and the oysters and a couple of beers the bill was still over fifty! I wont be back!   I have to now give praise to the Fish House! I first posted my thoughts on a food blog and never had a response. Once I posted on Yelp I received several e-mails all from different individuals voicing their concern about my experience at Kings! I have to say that my opinion has changed drastically about this establishment! If I get a response of concern like this from just my complaint I feel that they really do care about everything related to their establishment and have to give them cu dos and high marks! I will continue.....",

We asked for a booth and were seated in the bar area. Maybe we had bar staff waiting on us and that explained the service, but there shouldn't be any difference from the main room. We ordered two salads, I had soup and appetizer, and we got a kids meal. The service was fine at first, with the kids meal coming out first, then my soup....then my appetizer....then nothing. Had to ask for more bread. About 45 min after waiting, we asked the front staff to tell the manager to get us some service. A few min later, our waiter came back, no apology, no eye contact, very sullen. He took a couple dishes away and said the food would be coming soon. Fifteen minutes later, still nothing, the waiter couldn't even be bothered to come by again. An hour after we had arrived and my husband still hadn't gotten anything to eat except the bread. We decided to leave and talked to the manager who apologized, comped what we had ordered and gave us a gift card. We'll obviously come back since this is clearly not normal for a restaurant like this, but was very surprised at such poor service on this night.",

The prices for oysters are reasonable. The ones I had just weren't shucked properly. Every one I slurped came with an unexpected piece of shell. It was really a bummer. This place does have a helluva lot of sauces to choose from, though, if you're adventurous.   Their Happy Hour menu isn't anything impressive. Not at all. Yucky American beer, like Bud, counts toward the $3.25 pint. Nothing else does. They do have a great Honey Ale and also offer Moose Drool here, as well as Orion, the best Japanese beer you'll find. And it costs $7.50 for the 22 oz, whereas you'll pay $9.00 for the same at Kabuki.  They also have a short sushi menu. It's not too impressive, but it's enough to pique your interest. I really loved their Rainbow Roll.   Maybe it's b/c we sat at the bar, but we barely got any service. And it began to annoy me. We had to ask for water. We had to ask to order. We had to ask for another 'round. We had to ask for soy sauce trays. We had to ask for just about everything, in fact.   The atmosphere is ordinary - what you might expect from a place called a \"Fish House.\" Nothing really stood out to me.   Would I be back? Uhm, maybe, since they do have a couple good beers available, they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from... I just hope next time they're shucked properly.   I would like to try their King Crab/Shrimp appetizer. It was served to the gentleman beside us. It sounded good on the menu. It looked even better in person.   All in all, an okay place. But again, I think it's overpriced. You can easily walk out of there having spent $40 on a beer, a sushi roll and oysters.",

    "text": "Super-nice staff... our server was attentive and friendly.   The decor/ambiance... well, it looks nice. As we walked up to it, we noticed a very fishy smell - that's never a good sign at a fish restaurant. However, we noticed on our way in that they had some oysters sitting on some ice at the bar and we decided to believe that's where the odor was coming from and not the actual entrees. Our menus were even fancy and clean and had today's date printed on them, so we knew we were getting some fresh shit. Overall, we were pretty impressed.   Now, I'm usually at a loss at fish restaurants since I'm more of a deep-fried cod and chips sort of guy. Most foo-foo fish places think the fish doesn't need any sauces or spices. To me, most fish tastes about the same - like not much. It's all about texture basically. Anyway - I had the Halibut and it was tasty - although a bit dry. It was also pretty expensive for a restaurant located in a mall built mainly for college kids at 26 bucks - though it did come with two \"sidekicks\" (which i assume refers to the fact that they will feel like a baby in your belly kicking your sides and squirming for the rest of the night).  They brought us some bread to snack on and it was great sourdough (the butter pats looked like 6 pack abs). The mac and cheese sidekick was very tasty and the fries weren't so bad. I mean, there's really not much else to say - I got great service and ate my food until I was bursting. The only drawbacks were the price and the Halibut was a tiny bit dry (but still good). I tasted the Salmon as well and that was prepared perfectly (but I don't like salmon).   I like this place better than Wildfish simply because this joint lacks the pretension you get with the type of patron it attracts. King's is very nearly a 5 star... I look forward to hitting this place up for a happy hour sometime to save some bucks. I'm also looking forward to getting some shrimp or scallop dish.",

I ended up here for lunch with a handful of co-workers last week because we put the lunch option up to a vote, and this was the compromise spot.  This place isn't great, but it isn't horrible.  I'd never come here again of my own volition, but if I ended up here for some reason beyond my control, I'd find something on the menu that wouldn't suck.  As far as chain fish joints in Phoenix go, this is not nearly as good as say ... Kincaid's ... but it's far better than Joe's Crab Shack.  And that, in a nutshell, is why I give this place three stars.",

    "text": "My mom came to my side of town for us to have lunch and proclaimed she wanted lobster bisque. We both searched via our tech routes, her on her GPS, me on my phone via Yelp and I found this place first.   The reviews seemed to be mixed but Mom was paying so if she wanted lobster bisque, I was going to appease her.   The place looked dead from the outside and hardly any cars in the lot behind the restaurant didn't bode well. But they were open and just in the lull between lunch and dinner.   Mom got her lobster bisque and I decided to give it a whirl too. It was quite tasty and I didn't find it bland at all, unlike what one of the Yelpers said. I found it to have a nice little kick and loved the large chunks of lobster that are usually lacking at other places I've tried it.   Sourdough bread was served with our bisque and it was a very good sourdough.   Our server, Ismael, was very helpful with the large menu. About the only fault I could find with the service is that he seemed to be in a rush to leave the table while my mom was still talking to him. Granted, she was rambling a little about things not related to the menu but it was still a bit rude. The place wasn't busy so I don't think he had to rush off to help another table. I'm going to chalk this up to possible inexperience since Ismael's name tag was handwritten so maybe he was new?   We both decided to try a po' boy sandwich. The menu lists a shrimp po' boy but says to ask your server about other po' boys. We did ask and decided to try the oysters. The oysters in the sandwich were so tender and delicious. The sandwich came with fries and coleslaw. The fries were hot, thin and yummy. Coleslaw isn't my favorite but I didn't think to ask for something else. The sandwich had coleslaw inside too and that was okay but on its own I wasn't a fan.   Dessert was creme brulee, as usual. It was great with a large, sweet strawberry on top.   Going to take my fiance to try the oyster bar. Can't wait!",

I do not mind spending money if the meal is worth it.  I ordered a rare filet with lobster.  The filet was extremely rare, it was as if they left it on the grill just to brown the outsides.  The inside was cold it was so rare.  The lobster was chewy and difficult to eat.  It was later at night so idk if they stopped putting effort in cooking and wanted to get out of work or what.

I like to come through places like this and tune into a sporting event over a drink and conversation with friends of mine, so the bar is generally our scene. We had an appetizer and a couple of drinks and I can honestly say that if you're thinking about swinging through here, you won't be disappointed. It's a great environment and Gilbert did a fantastic job, I never once felt like I wasn't being attended to in an exceptional manner. That being said, I can't speak for the rest of the restaurant, but I can say that in past experiences, a great bar means a great restaurant, as the bar is often times the busiest and hardest to manage. I attribute this solely to a great bartender with a good personality who has an understanding for his / her job, and isn't there merely for looks.   In the end, I'm sure the entrees are great, but all we had were some appetizers and a few drinks, of which I was very pleased with the quality of and beyond pleased with the quality of the staff. In my opinion, hire more people like the bartender Gilbert, as the staff can set the tone right from the start.   King's Fish House, \"I'll be back\" *Arnold voice*",

So today I decided at the last minute to give this place a try.   The place is very modern looking and my son commented that it was something like a boat house. I could somewhat see that with lots of wood and pictures of fish.   Anyways, they started us off with  sour dough bread and butter. I always love sour dough bread and it was very good. For appetizers we had fried calamari and a few cups of clam chowder. The calamari were huge pieces with a very flakey batter on it. Excellent. Really enjoyed it. The clam chowder was gobbled up by my wife without no complaints. I tried it and was pretty good.   For our main course, I had the Ono fish with rosemary potatoes and mac and cheese. Ono fish is somewhat like the swordfish which is a little dry so overall I thought my meal was good. Loved the Mac and cheese with the rosemary potatoes. My wife had the Mahi-Mahi with spinach and carrots. Her meal was really good. This fish was very tender and juicy. Cooked perfect. She enjoyed it. My son had the linguini with clams and he gobbled it up so he really enjoyed it. My mom ordered the full fried catfish and when they say full. They mean full. Head and tail included. Huge catfish which was bigger than the plate but she ate it all and thought it was really good.   So overall, we had a good meal. Service was good. Our server kept filling our water cups up all the time and the food came out in a timely manner. All I can say is huge portions, good food, good service and we will be back again. Enjoy.",

    "text": "My husband and I have driven by this restaurant so many times and never went in until last week. We wanted to give it a try since it is near a lot of our other favorite restaurants in Tempe Marketplace.  When we walked in on a Saturday night it was not too busy which surprised us a little. We did notice they have a private dining room. And that was not in use. I would say it was about 60% at occupancy.  The patios were totally empty but it is still 100 degrees or warmer still.  We were given a large booth that was way too big for just two of us so we asked for something smaller. We were approached fairly quickly. Our drink orders were taken and for me drinking water it was not easy to get refills as much as I wanted. That was the only bad thing about the meal.  We got lots of bread and butter. That was nice. I ordered the Fish and Chips and they good. Not great, not terrible. Nothing new and exciting. The fish was great underneath the breading. It was a bit mushy and next time I would order it crispy. My husband had the cajun dish which he liked and had lots of flavor.  The ambiance was nice. Service was goof. Some food things could have been better. If you like fish try this place.",

    "text": "My husband, parents and I went to Kings Fish House at the beginning of March for my husbands birthday.  He is from Oregon, and a little bit of a seafood snob.  He really wanted seafood for his birthday meal.  We checked out places on Yelp but couldn't find any place that had great reviews and was in our price range.  We decided to take a chance on King's Fish House, and to be honest we were a little skeptical of a chain restaurant.   Not to mention my husband and his family goes clamming off of the Oregon coast several times a year, so he has high expectations for fresh clams. We were absolutely blown away by everything about this restaurant.   Our server for the night was Chris G, and he gave us some amazing recommendations.  He really listened to what flavors each of like individually and made individualized his recommendations for each of us.  Even pairing it with some wine and side dish recommendations.  Not to mention his recommendations for clams were spot on!!  Each of us had a different dish, and each of us swore we had the best dish at the restaurant.    In April we celebrated my fathers birthday, and he requested we go back to King's Fish House.  As soon as we walked in, we saw Chris. We requested him to be our server again.  Not only did he remember us, but he remembered what we had ordered a month earlier.  AMAZING!!  He gave us some new recommendations, and again his service was incredible!!  My personal recommendation... go to the Kings Fish House and sit in Chris' section.  Get some of the Skookum clams if they are in, and definitely try the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut.  Delicious!!  We will be back again very soon!!",

We are Californians and eat fresh calamari all year long including just a couple of weeks ago at King's in Anaheim.  This comes down to over frying in a thick horrid batter to disguise the fact the chef did NOT properly clean the squid. It's not ticket science. Thanks to last night, it will be sometime before I can eat calamari again and I was sick to my stomach all night. Upside is they comped our wine and gave us a gift card.

AZ has zero good seafood, zero! Outside of the Salt Cellar, but I never even think to go to that place. For God's sake the entire thing is a basement with what looks to be an outhouse on top of it. Land Ho.   Anyhow, this, IMO, is some of the most decent fish you can find in the valley. It's incredibly overpriced, and unless you're sitting at the bar, the service just isn't great. If you are lucky enough to time your visit right around when the sourdough loaves come screaming out of the ovens, you're in luck. Fresh bread here is amazing... But wait fifteen minutes, and you are screwed. Stale bread city. The entrees are overpriced and over portioned, but what can you do. Be careful about ordering anything with sauce - your poor little dinner will be drowning in it. That was not an ocean joke. I am being very serious. Ease up on the sauce, King.   NOW!!! The good part. We thoroughly enjoy coming here on Sunday mornings during football season and sitting in the empty bar enjoying oysters on the half shell and beers. This place has a honey beer that is out of this world! You can't get it anywhere else, and that alone is worth the three stars.   So let's recap - bar, oysters, beer = good!! Dining room, stale bread, drowning entrees = meh!!",

King's Fish House  Where you can get an entire glob of tuna fish smeared between two slices of whole wheat bread. An artful creation resembling something your eight year-old niece would throw together, this along with a fistful of french fries and some bitter-as-gall deli slaw, and all for surrendering that dirty twenty! Actually it's 10.95 but with the diet coke and the tip, you're now up around twenty.   Other delights our party sampled were from the \"Fried\" section.  The menu description only reading Farm Raised Mexican Shrimp. It didn't say how these little Mexican Shrimp numbered only four.  Or how they must've been raised in one of the Kennedy's swimming holes in the Hampton's where they were fed fois gras and cavear, sipped champagne from gold-rimmed flutes, and had their own nanny, wistfully lulling them to sleep each night with old Raffi tunes.  Because at 13.95 for four of these little bastards, they must've led one pampered life on that farm!  Three of us. Two tuna fish sandwiches. And one small school of Mexican Shrimp, a water, a diet coke and an iced tea....48.95, with ten bucks for the tip, almost sixty bucks.  Unless you're dining on the company expense account, or someone else is picking up the tab, theres no reason on earth to pay twenty bucks for a tuna fish sandwich and a diet coke.  Or for that matter,  watch your friend eat  four of the Kennedy's prized pets.",

Sourdough bread to start.. hard exterior, did not taste anything close to fresh,, anyways,, looking over the menu, and was a little shocked.. prices higher than \"pappadeaux\" n thinking the food quality better match..  Appetizer PEI mussels - decent flavor , but 1/3 look over dehydrated, almost as if they were dead way before cooking time. or recooked or something,, those we un-edible.  Wife got the clam chowder which was actually really good..  hence 2 stars  I thought, 22 bucks for some scallops,, hmm, let me try that out.. huge plate came out with these little marble sized scallops, 12 of them.. thats almost 2 dollars a piece for each lil scallop, Side zuchini was ok, but the cole slaw definitely not great,, some bites had that sour weird rubberband taste,,  Waitress, awesome, always smiling, refilling our drinks,,   Finished with a $60 bill,, not even close to satisfied and never going back..  If you want seafood on the east valley, go ahead n hit up red lobster, if you want some great seafood, hit up n. phoenix to pappadeaux(worth the drive and time, will never be dissatisfied)  Lesson Learned. :-(",

We had double shot beverages and were informed after our bills came that we would be charged for separate shots which cost more than the drink itself. Considering you couldn't taste the liquor this was rather upsetting. The manager put blame on the waitress for not telling us ahead of time. Poor thing didn't see that bus coming.",

    "text": "I went on a local seafood restaurant kick over the holidays, including serving King Crab for Christmas Dinner. Check out all my current reviews.   Everyone knows it's thin picking when it comes to \"fresh seafood\" in Phoenix, but Kings Fish House at Tempe Marketplace is the standout IMO. Kings is actually a wholesale fish distributer out of Santa Ana, CA. This allows their Fish House's to have one of the largest seafood selections in Southern Cal.   Been coming to the Tempe location since it opened, a solid 4 star seafood \"eating\" experience. Their selections are extensive, I suggest you check out the online menu to prepare yourself before you visit. While the decor is modern and clean, to be honest, its just a tad boring for me. The oyster bar should be just jumping ... but they have a totally clueless happy hour, the place just lacks excitement!  The quality of the seafood and large selection of fresh oysters at Kings Fish House puts Pappadeaux to shame, but the low energy keeps Kings from being more popular IMO. Rarely is the bar or restaurant over half full, I guess that good or bad depending on your viewpoint or philosophy.  A much more creative happy hour experience and late night \"live local Jazz\" would really put this place on the map ... yet still fit their theme.   The potential of Kings Fish House is off the chart ... if only they could light a fire under the local management.",

    "text": "King's Fish House provided a nice fish option in Tempe.  I used to go to Rockfish in Chandler, but I believe that closed.  I am not that big of a fan of fish, but my cardiologist is, so here I am looking for fish.  I liked the atmosphere of the place - dead fish on the wall, jazz lightly in the background and napkins with fish caricature napkins. The menu was very big and apparently printed every day as it had the date printed on the menu.  That might be a little costly from an operations standpoint, but it was a cool touch.   I started with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder ($3.95) and my friend the lobster bisque cup ($5.45). The lobster was a little high for a cup, but both soups were excellent. My friend ordered an Arnold Palmer ($3.95) to drink and it was commented to me that it wasn't very good in comparison to other places. I had the diet coke ($2.95).  I ordered the wild salmon for $12.75 and my friend had the rockfish for $11.95. Both of us chose the sauteed spinach. I had the rosemary potatoes and my friend the garlic mashed potatoes. The food was fine - it was fish and there's only so much you can do with a piece of grilled fish.  I did order dessert - the fruit crisp ($6.95). I was a little disappointed that the option of the day was peach. Peaches , oatmeal and vanilla ice cream...surprisingly it was excellent! Really the best part of the meal. I would have liked to see the peaches maybe cut because it was challenging to dig in and reel in a big peach.   The service was excellent. My server Katie was cool, very nice and prompt.  It was a good meal if you want fish - but  maybe $ 51 for lunch is a bit too high.",

The wild shrimp was not fresh,  sauteed spinach too much garlic.  When asked our friends how their meals were one said he enjoyed the trout almondine, others were so, so - disappointed the scallops were small - which our Server told us was because they were not in season.  We had to flag a server down to ask for something  - seems all held their heads up in the sky instead of looking around for their customers inquiries or needs.  When we inquired about  the salted caramel ice cream for dessert, we were informed that it is only available in the summer and had to coax our Server to tell us what else was available, again she seemed very bothered. We will not be back - not any of us, will visit this place only on our trips to Southern California. Perhaps they should have the Employees in Calif. train the Servers & Chefs in Tempe.",

The kitchen made a small goof in timing and he offered us options to maximize the pace of our dinner experience. That was a subtle thing made a huge difference. I'll eat here again just to sit at his table.  The food wasn't miraculous, but I'm certain I'll have a hard time finding better shrimp or scallops.",

My daughter surprised so we enjoyed a lunch for 4. We had fish and chips, crab cakes, a tuna melt and crispy Brussel sprouts. For dessert we had creme brulee. First of all we are san diegans and know our seafood. The fish and chips were PERFECTLY battered and HUGE. I hate getting all batter and almost no fish or some gross, mealy fish. This was a huge, perfectly crispy fillet, it was accompanied by garlic fries and cole slaw. My daughter had the crab cakes, super good and firm, good crab to breading ratio. Her boyfriend had the tuna melt and ate every crumb. He said it was the best he's had. And I am a brussel sprout addict. These were delicious. My picts say it all. The creme brulee was perfect. It didn't taste like butane like many of them do. They also use real vanilla. These guys know what they are doing and I can't wait to go back!",

My brother who now lives in Phoenix suggested that we try Kings saying that it used to be my fad's favorite when he lived here. Wow... we got to the restaurant a little early and found a lovely table outside on the patio. Rudy was exceptionally attentive...guiding us through the menu and making little recommendations here in there. There was nothing that we ordered that wasn't extraordinary. Our personal favorite was the shrimp. The N'awlins Barbecue Shrimp was to die for and the servings were very generous. My only regret is that I had no room for dessert. I guess that means I have to hurry back soon!!",

We stopped in for dinner on a Thursday evening after doing some shopping in Tempe marketplace and were excited to try it out since we love seafood. The one star is for the super friendly hostess who greeted and nicely chatted with us on our way to our table. We ordered a half dozen oysters as an appetizer and then shared a salmon dinner plate. The oysters were not properly shucked so I ended up with small pieces of shell in my mouth which quickly made us decide not to finish the half dozen. When the salmon dish came the fish was completely raw inside. After waiting for our waitress to come back to check on us (which she never did), we finally flagged down another employee to ask if they could cook the salmon more. This employee quickly told us that they were instructed to always cook salmon to medium rare (ours was not even rare) and that this happened a lot. After getting our re-heated salmon dish back, we took a few bites to find it was still pretty raw inside so we just finished our side dishes and went on our way. Sad to say- both my husband and I were up most of the night with food poisoning. I would not recommend this restaurant.",

Not only was this visit better than the last, but it exceeded our expectations.  It started off with Timber, our server, who was exceptional.  She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was willing to explain anything we needed to know, always with a smile on her face.  When she asked if we would like a salad before our meal, she could see us contemplating and suggested that we share a salad...perfect! She also brought it out on two separate plates so that we didn't have to do it ourselves.  Timber kept our glasses filled during the entire meal and was attentive but not overbearing.  She was great!  The manager, Patrick, also visited our table to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves and had everything we needed.  The staff at this location was excellent and it is obvious that they care about their guests.  On to the food...we started off with the sourdough bread.  It came out warm and was fresh and delicious.  We then split a caesar salad.  Again, fresh and yummy.  Then, the entrees came.  We both ordered the blackened salmon.  I opted for grilled zucchini and glazed carrots for my sides while the hubs asked for the buttered corn.  OMG...we love to smoke our salmon at home but we both agreed that this was by far the best salmon we've ever had at a restaurant.  It was that good! In addition, the sides were just as enjoyable.  Super flavorful and cooked just right.    I'm so glad we didn't give up on Kings Fish House.  This visit was amazing and we will definitely be returning for some more of that salmon!",

The only hiccup in our experience was the underwhelming level of service provided by our server but the restaurant manager personally took care of the situation , without us bringing it to her attention which made the overall experience outstanding. I wish I could have given it 5 stars but the lack of attention by our original server prevented it. Overall a great place though.",

    "text": "I am on the fence as to whether I go with a 2star on this review or a 3. THIS is when I wish there were half stars! It's not quite a 3 and yet not as low as a 2. Oh well, I digress. You get my point, I am sure. If not, you likely may after you read my review. I had this place bookmarked in my handy dandy Yelp bookmarks for months as places I needed to try. Being from the coast of Nor Californ I A , I crave , YEARN for seafood. Last weekend my hubby and I opted for King's Fish House over another seafood place that is also on our bookmarks and more towards his office because it looked fun and lively and the menu looked good. We were also in the neighborhood. I was on the fence with what to order once I saw the Filet and South African Lobster. Again, being picky, as I notably am, I asked the waitress about the lobster and the size of the filet. She could not give me sizes on either, rather, 'It's good size and the lobster is, BIG'. Okay. That's relative. I just did a hike with my husband and I were hungry! I also asked about the Shrimp and Crab Louie, again, one of those things I LOVE from home. Same answer, \"It's BIG!\" Clearly our waitress was excited about the menu and thats a good thing! She can't make my mind up, so I went with the Filet and Lobster. My husband ordered the Oysters Rockefeller. They seem to be prepared differently everywhere that we travel or dine, which is a lot and all over. Did I love these? No. It wasn't the oyster. It was the sauce. It was lemony and just had a strange consistency and looked odd to me. I could not get past that. I let my husband have at it. The next course that I had was the Clam Chowder. Loved it! It was lukewarm but was still so good. Again, being from just north of SF, the bar is set pretty high for clam chowder and this was very good. We asked for bread, a) because I feel clam chowder HAS to have good bread with it!, and b) we saw it on other guests table..Envy! Oh! Did I mention and can one tell from this review that my husband and I were HANGRY !! this particular night?! We finally flagged our waitress down for the bread and she explained that she didn't understand what was up with the kitchen and , 'they seemed to be out of it and it appeared that they were baking more'. I also asked about that  glass of Pinot Noir that I had ordered. She looked a little confused but got it. Now our dinner arrives. When I have any steak anywhere, I always check the done-ness of it first, because at times, its over done. This would be one of those times. This was more like medium to done in the center and no pink on the edges. The filet was also not juicy. Was it 'good sized' , as she claimed when I initially asked? No. This is where I always have an issue as a customer: DO I say anything? I mean, she seems busy! Am I being high maintenance? I've already asked for the bread; requested the late Pinot! NOW the filet is off! THEN as a Yelper, I leave a review and someone then messages me, or has and says , \"Hey! Did you let the waitress know?\" In this case, my husband says, \" That is a $45. meal. We are telling her.\" The lobster was good. Not great. It was good. Maybe the food had sat for a few before she could get it to us? It happens on busy nights! I waitressed back in the day in college! I know how it goes! So she comes and we explain. She states that she will see if she can re-do it and a few minutes later she comes back to say they are re-doing a steak for me. Several minutes later, as my husband is pretty much done with his meal and I have finished most of my lobster and now down to the part of what is a baked potato that isn't fully done... (not raw, but not cooked enough to eat), out comes another filet with a different person who asks me to cut into it while she watches. I cut into the middle and it doesn't look medium rare either , but it did look juicer and hot. I do not want to deal with this all evening and I am pretty much over it at this point. She walks away and the same thing. This time the edges of the steak were even more done than the first! I would not think this is that difficult! I've cooked filets at home; its simple to get a medium rare steak! As I said, I was over trying to get it correct at that point. I did like what was cooked of the baked potato! I probably didn't need the entire thing anyway, as it was pretty big! The Sauteed Spinach side was cooked perfectly and I took that home after being full and added it to my eggs the next day. The Pinot was good, as well and the waitress, she totally tried! She was cheerful to the end with us! We thought she was great! Now the bus girl cleaning the table behind us who spilled water and then said, \"OH SH*&! \" in a whispering voice; Well. We heard that and that's probably not okay! The decor was nice and the patio seemed fun. We also liked being able to call ahead and get a reservation with no issues. See, it's not all bad. Would I come back? Probably not. Back to my bookmarks!",

We starked with the ahi poke which was decent, could have used a little wasbi to enhance the flavors.  I shared a bit of the grilled artichoke appetizer, which for being healthy was great.  For my main I had the Seared Ahi Tuna $16.95 with 2 sides. The tuna was surprisingly great, thick, no sinuousness at all great color and flavor. The sides selection is also quite impressive and one can even have a small salad as one of the sides.  You can't avoid some of the chain quirks, like why am i given tartar sauce with seared ahi, and not soy and wasabi / ginger  Service was decent given our large group, and the ambiance is a notch above family casual, I would call it business casual.   Overall it is not a cheap meal, but good fish rarely is.",

I started off with a half dozen oyster sampler which I was told their selection changes everyday because everything is fresh.  We then had a candied walnut and blue cheese salad which I couldn't let me server take because I truly had to finish every last bite.  For my entree I had the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut which was cooked perfectly.  My wife, as I mentioned doesn't like seafood, had a filet.  It was ordered medium and cooked perfectly.  Along with the other dinner items we ordered, she couldn't have been more happy.    The service in the restaurant was on spot.  Our server was Ashley and she was amazing. However, when she was taking care of other tables, other servers came to make sure we were enjoying our experience there!  We will be back!  The only person that left unhappy was our son who had baby food for dinner.    P.S.  Have the Key Lime Pie!",

I will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "This place is OK. I ordered broiled Oregon Red Rock fish, which, the first time it was brought to me, was WAY over cooked.. The nice thing about this place is their service. They were very accomodating, they had no problem redoing my fish. In fact, they brought me a whole new plate! and offered free dessert! (thank you Chris, our server) The second fish, was ok, probably more my mistake for ordering a bland fish (I wanted to try something different) then their cooking methods. But,at least it was not over cooked the second time, but definitly needed salt (and maybe a sauce on the side??)  My husband, however, loved his meal. He had swordfish picatta, which he throughly enjoyed. For the prices on the menu, I did expect more...presentation wasn't exactly bon appetit worthy....If I'm paying so much for a fish, it would be nice to see a little creativity...  I did think it was nice that they print a new menu everyday (check the top right hand corner for the day's date), kind of a nice touch.   To sum up, I give 2 stars for food, 4 stars for service (so I put it in the middle for the rating of this review).",

It's in a unique spot in Tempe marketplace, and I knew parking would not be easy, but I didn't care.  I found the service to be very good and helpful.  I would go back.",

    "text": "Much better this time around.  The GM, Kari, sent us gift certificates after my negative review, with an apology. We gave King's a second chance on Saturday night.  This time, we were seated in the bar area, which had a lot more pleasant atmosphere (less diner-y and loud, with a view through the bar window of the Tempe Marketplace fountain). Our server, Nicole, was much more attentive and pleasant than our last server. She even brought bread out before we even ordered - yay!  The food was greatly improved as well - we didn't order the same things, but usually if a place sucks, it sucks all the way around. Boyfriend did the Captain's Platter (fried scallops and fish) and really liked it; fried without the meat being overcooked, still juicy. I did the Seafood Cobb Salad, and it was really excellent - the shrimp were so flavorful and the salad was HUGE. They did not skimp on any of the ingredients. I'd definitely get it again.  The bread pudding was... different. My other half really liked it (it's drowning in Jack Daniels sauce, of course he did) but the texture was strange to me; reminded me of French toast, it was mostly bread in sauce, not really \"pudding\" to me. It was very good though.  I'm glad to be able to re-write my review positively :)",

    "text": "It's that time of year.... time to figure out what overly priced restaurant to pick out for my office holiday party. Hey, the boss is buyin' not me. :-)  We settled on King's Fish House, and I am glad we did.   We had a reservation for 6pm for 8 people, figuring we would show up early and get our much needed drink on at the bar. They were very slow when we arrived so we has the bar to ourselves. ***Incoming - Reason for the 5 starts*** The bar chairs are the best! Big, cushy and have backs, AND they have hooks under the bar top for my bad. Honestly, this is such a small touch, but some places fail so miserably at these two key elements that I never go back. Seriously though, if you are in the market for a bar with awesome bar seats, you have to go here! It's genius! If your seats suck I wont stay as long, if they are nice I wont want to move, duh!  Back to the matter at hand, we had a drink then sat down for dinner, Chris was our server and we were very pleased with him. *high five to Chris* He went thought the menu very well and explained everything we were unsure about. We started off with a handful of appetizers, a few oyster shooters, the combo plate with calamari and shrimp and crab cakes, and some salads. The shooters were shooters, decent quality, can't really screw them up. The fried stuff was good, but nothing to gloat about. Their ramoulade sauce was awesome though! Even ordered an extra side to go with my dinner. The salads looked ehh underwhelming. The Danish Blue that I got was ok, the highlight was the huge slice of blue cheese it came with, the rest was an after thought.   Everyone got something different for the entrees and I am pretty sure everyone was happy because the chatter was to a minimum while we stuffer our faces. I got the Grilled Salmon with mac'n'cheese and grilled zucchini, excellent all around!  We topped off the nigh with some Creme Brulee..... not too bad. I prefer it thinner then they serve it but I was still in creme heaven.   We were all very happy, great place! Enjoy if you make it in!",
