    "text": "One of those places you typically drive by and wonder, \"wonder if that's any good?\" Located right next to the blue and white mosque off Forest Avenue near ASU, Phoenicia gives you that feeling of eating off the beaten path. A co-worker of mine and I went on lunch, while we found a seat, the service was pretty slow. I ordered a plate of hummus (because I could down a tub of it in one sitting) and needless to say I was pretty disappointed. The hummus was not overly flavored - boring and bland. We split a falafel plate - consisting of 2 falafel pitas and rice. It was pretty good. Not spectacular, but decent. We also ordered some baklava to go - the traditional flavor was best, I don't recommend the chocolate one, too slimy.",

For those interested, there is a Middle Eastern grocery located right next to it.  Both the falafel and hummus are very tasty, and I have enjoyed their chicken shwarma pita sandwich, too.  They also have very good baklava.  My favorite dish, however, is the chicken ghallaba entree, which consists of strips of chicken with vegetables and rice in what I believe is a spicy tomato-based sauce.  The entrees come in generous portions, so come with an appetite or be prepared to take leftovers home.  This restaurant is within walking distance from ASU, which means that it gets really busy during the lunch hour.  Be sure to get there early if you want lunch, in order to avoid the crowds.",

This was Darius' first time with Mediterranian cuisine and after reading all the glowing reviews for here - I knew this was the place to take him! :)  We had some hummus as an appetizer, and oh em gee!! it was so great! I couldn't believe it was so creamy and perfectly garlicly!! Normally hummus is a lil too strong for me but this was great.  I had the Gyro plate and it was a LOT of food! I enjoyed it very much, I just wish it came with more pita bread. Gyro meat was plated with some more hummus, basmati rice and fixins for awesome gyros. My friend had this dish with garbanzo beans and lamb. He really enjoyed it and said it the meat was tender. I didn't try it but it sure looked good. :)  We closed our meal with some blaklavah - they have different varieties of the mediterranian staple, I had the walnut backlavah and he had the pistashio. I liked it but I've had better and it was WAY too sweet, I couldn't finish it!   Over all, this is one of the best places I've discovered since moving to Tempe. I really enjoy it and look forward to finding more places! To my yelpers, I say: GO! The food is yummy, the decor is cute and clean, the service is more than decent and the location is mill but NOT mill.. gotta love it!",

I got a peice of baklava on our way out, and we both picked up some delicious greek chocolate goodies for the office communal snack desk. My baklava was probably the best I've had. Definitely fresh and made on site.   Didn't get a chance to browse through the mini market they have, but I will DEFINITELY be going back to do so!",

I had the chicken schwarma (forgive spelling errors :) plate, falafel, and greek salad.  The greek salad was good, better than the rest of the food, but $7 (too expensive in my opinion).  The places that come to mind that I think are far better are Greek wraps, king gyro, the greek corner, shish kabob house, even some of the food at pita jungle beats the meal we had here.  I wasn't impressed with the bakava either. I can't say I will go back, I just wasn't impressed at all.  I do have to say though, the server was nice, it was clean...

Still not sure why the boy invited me out to lunch if he wasn't hungry, but I was starving so I was down.  I ended up getting the something kafta and he got the spanakopita.  The food arrived promptly and the kafta was huge!  It came with two huge pieces of ground lamb, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita.  The spanakopita was also a huge for an appetizer.  I didn't have any of the spanakopita because I was so busy enjoying my meal.  The lamb was perfectly seasoned and was a great match for the addicting garlic sauce and the hummus.  Walked out of here paying less than $15.  Definitely a great meal at an amazing price!  I can see why it's packed with college students  If you are getting dessert, I would skip over the jellied treats and go for the baklava.  Nothing can beat baklava.",

Not only is this the best Middle Eastern retaurant in The Valley, it's also MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF TEMPE.   The chicken Shwarma is delicious, and the hummus is the best in the state. For a cheap meal, try the \"hommus deluxe\" with chicken or lamb. It eats like a meal.   Tack on a delightful staff, and a comfortable atmosphere, and what you have is probably the most underrated restaurant in Arizona.  \"Best hummus\", \"best Middle Eastern food\", \"best restaurant in Tempe\", \"most underrated\"...I know, that's a lot of superlatives - this place deserves each one.",

Like others say in their reviews the chicken shawerma and accompanying garlic sauce were pretty good.  I found the chicken to be a bit greasy and a bit overcooked - almost dry.  The sauce was a nice surprise, and wouldn't you know it, it was gone much sooner than I anticipated.  The chicken and garlic sauce left me otherwise unspeakable (Hello, my name is Dragonbreath) and burping the rest of the day.  But with food this good I had no regrets.  The saffron rice  was a winner, but the pita was a bit dry.   It's kind of modest inside with brightly colored booths.  The wait during lunch time can be a bother.  We waited around for about 10 minutes and had to flag someone down since the guy was wrapped up at the cash register the whole time.  We were never given refills throughout our lunch -- only at the end when our table was cleared, and we were lingering for a half hour.",

    "text": "Words cannot fully explain what an awful experience I had at my most recent visit to this establishment. Having been here atleast 20 times, I convinced a couple of my friends to try this place for lunch. After we placed our order, the waitress confirmed our selections. When the food arrived, one of the meals was incorrect (the order was for a chicken dish, but the meal received was beef). One bite of the dish was enough for my friend to know he would not be able to eat it, so we sent it back and asked for something different. At this point I was not at all upset, as a former server I know that mistakes happen. After we ate, the waitress informed us that we would still be charged for the incorrect order as she insisted that she brought what we ordered. We could hear her arguing with the chef in Spanish about how she wrote the order down right, and that everything was our fault. I am fluent in Spanish, so I understood every insulting word that she said. We decided to speak with the owner, as we did not feel that we should have to pay for both the incorrect order AND the correct order (which by the way was terrible). I have never actually seen a restaurant enforce such a policy. The owner informed us that the mistake was by the server, and that he would remove it from the bill but she would have to pay for it herself. I told him that was not acceptable as mistakes happen. He continued to argue that she would have to pay, he even went so far as to call her stupid for making such a mistake on a slow day and that she needed to pay for her mistakes. His attitude was unbelievable, and his blatant disrespect for his female employees was beyond words. The owner makes the guy from the episode of Kitchen Nightmares featuring Amy's Baking Company look reasonable. If you are in the mood for Middle-Eastern food, try Haji-Baba, Curry Corner, or Sahara.",

    "text": "This place loses out due to poor customer service, which is a shame, because the food is good.  it didn't used to always be this way.  It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management.   Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back.   We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again?   So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged.",

The rice cooked right, flavored well and not sticky and soggy or hard and powdery. The meat tender (can be a touch dry on the occasion) and spiced well. The service tends to be polite and very accommodating; though once the guy seemed to be having a bad day. (drinks, serve yourself) The atmosphere, nothing special and not romantic, but unique.

When I pointed out that the sandwiches were only $6 on the menu (in fact the \"combo\" that included the side and drink was only $9, he said :well, you didn't order a drink\" and then said \"ok\" and changed the total to $24.70.  Though I wanted to question it again I just went ahead and paid it since I was with a guest.  (It's only a few bucks, right?)   When I requested a receipt, he muttered \"oh my god\" under his breath.  Yes, oh my god,  I wasn't expecting bad customer service and a lack of scruples as part of my lunch combo.  Watch your wallet carefully at this place.",

We ate three or four pita breads each with delicious hummus. The lamb was my favorite, so tender, so soft, and very delicious.   If you're a college student or looking for a yummy cheap eat, this is it! Use your smart phones, check-in, mention YELP and get a deal! On the ride home, that's what me and my friends talked about: how we just ate some of the most tender and delicious food for under $5!!",

My colleagues are big fans of the Greek fries. I've only gotten them once and while they are very good it's not something I want to spend the extra calories on very often.   It's a family owned business and we are nearly always served by a family member. The food comes out quickly, and is always fresh. With 3 or 4 new buildings going up here I hope for my own selfish reasons this place doesn't get overly crowded in the near future!",

    "text": "Cous Cous Review:   I had heard so much about the cous cous here that I had to try it. I really didn't know what to expect, especially considering that cous cous is a tiny pasta that I have always known to be somewhat bland. Well, not here.   First off, the presentation of the meal was very nice. A big pile of yellow cous cous in the middle surrounded by vegetables, with a lamb shank on the side.   The waiter, Hakim, told me to start with the cous cous as to not fill up on the meat. He said that in Morocco, the family eats from one large plate and the mother divides the meat into equal portions for the kids only after other parts of the meal have been eaten.   He was right, and the cous cous was a treat in itself. It had a texture reminiscent of the maza used in Mexican tamales, but less greasy.  It had a buttery flavor and could be eaten fluffy of smashed together.   The vegetables were in what tasted like a tomato based sauce that was light and sweet.  There were a variety of vegetables including bell peppers, cauliflower, carrots and peas.  Similar to American beef pot roast vegetables, they were very tender and went well with the cous cous and the meat.  The meat! Oh the tender, tender lamb shank that was falling off the bone was very similar to a traditional american pot roast, especially combined with the veggies and the starch.  It is exactly what I would expect a family to sit around and eat together in Moracco or here, just like I have done many times with my own family.    It was a very hearty meal, yet I didn't feel like taking a nap afterward.  I was surprised to find that the flavors were very familiar, with nothing standing out as especially different from what most Americans would consider commonplace, but that is not to say it wasn't fantasatic.  I'd eat this meal again, but only if I wasn't looking for a culinary adventure like I usually am when I am out and about.  Like my friend John once told me while I was waiting for him at a restaurant, \"Just order me the oddest thing on the menu, if they don't have anything odd, I'll take the soup.\"    So, in conclusion, this traditional fare is great, a safe choice for a hungry person not looking for any surprises.",

The bread pie is delicious, I think that the price is fair for what it is, though I must acknowledge that other places would definitely take 3 dollars for it, so kudos to Phoenicia for keeping it student friendly! The Turkish coffee was delicious and had me buzzed halfway down my tiny espresso cup. Needless to say, baklava was good, a perfect way to end my day.

The service is friendly but what gets to me here is the owner/men at counter up front- they aren't friendly at all & don't ever smile or greet you!   And this is really cheap, They have offers on yelp & when i click to use it, the guy at the front says NOO u can't use it! Why have offers and entice customers to come to the place and then say no to them after they are in! Marketing ploy?! Well it's not like I m gonna leave now bcs of that, will I? Hence the stars or STAR!",

Another friend had the shrimp kabob plate and another friend had the chicken plate. Portions were huge and quiet tasty. Leave room for their baklava.

It was pretty crowded when we went but the service was still good and it was pretty quick. You have to go pay in the little market thats attached to the restaurant which isn't my favorite because there can be a line. Also, last time we went somehow two chicken pitas added up to like 30 dollars which seemed wrong so hopefully that doesn't happen again.

My standby is the schawarma salad, but today I tried the chicken kabobs, and it's definitely my new go-to! The portions are so generous, you're certain to have leftovers (or at least not to leave hungry)! I always eye the baklava behind the counter, but the day still hasn't come when I've had enough of an appetite to enjoy both the meal and dessert. The chicken is always juicy and flavorful, and in the kabob's case, comes with a great garlic sauce (a little goes a long way!) to dip it in. The hummus and pita that come with it are one of my favorite parts of the meal! This place reminds me of a halal Mediterranean'ized Defalco's, if you've ever been there. It's half grocer, half restaurant with an all-too-tempting dessert counter. If you're looking for authentic, fresh Middle Eastern food stop in here... it's the best!!",

It is a perfect blend of juicy and savory lamb, along with feta, cucumbers, lettuce, onions and tomatoes, finely chopped and topped with olive oil and vinegar. It is my favorite dish there. The plates are also excellent, and come with rice and vegetables, but are more for dinner fare. They have recently added lunch combos with fries and a drink to any pita for an additional $2.00, but they haven't posted it on the menu. You can still order it, though!   I will keep coming back for the flavors and the prices, especially when Yelp has a deal like they one they have now!",

When you are in the Tempe area it is a real treat.  They make their own pita bread sold fresh and warm so you can pick up a package before you leave.  Wonderful assortment of baklava as well.   The owner is a delightful friendly man from Tunisia.  He makes you feel very comfortable and eager to please his customers.   We ordered an assortment of wonderfully prepared Middle Eastern dishes.  The servings are enormous.  I had the gyro sandwich which was so packed with the beef and lamb gyro meat. It was a challenge to eat.   We also ordered the chicken patty dish which was seasoned just right.  The rice was wonderful with a side dish of a garlicky sauce.  The hummus is absolutely the best especially if you are a garlic lover.   The server hailed from Morocco and happy to tell about his life spent there.  I can't say enough good things about this wonderful Cafe.  P.S. If you go on a Saturday the meters are running so make sure you put in your money.  You can easily get a ticket.  Only free parking on Sunday otherwise you must put your change in the meters.  It is different in Downtown Phoenix where Sat. and Sun. are free.  Same as Tucson, so beware before you park outside.",

    "text": "A truly good authentic chicken shawarma holds very strict criteria and high standards. This is due in part to the dish being so popular that even the smallest variation of ingredients can make this dish not as good compared to others. The best way to prepare a chicken Shawarma is to make sure all of the meats have been prepared correctly; including having been tenderize and roasted for at least one day. This piece of criteria allows for the chicken shawarma to truly obtain all of its delicious flavors because the meats will become perfected and will also have time to roast and mature.   The chicken Sharma for which I sampled at the Phoenician restaurant did indeed be this criteria because the meat was very tender, especially the chicken dish for which I ordered. The chicken had been roasted for one and a half days. I found this out because I asked the owner to fill me in on the recipe and how the food item was prepared and for how long. I discovered that the chicken Shawarma also met the criteria of being high quality because the meats were slowly roasted with special hand-picked house blended sauce; allowing for all of the meats to caramelize and obtain juiciness while they became tender.",

Name me a dining venue in the Phoenix metro area that's not air conditioned? Ha! That's what I thought.  My friend ordered the shish kabob pita and I the shish kafta. I'm used to Mediterranean food so I liked the food I ordered. My friend, on the other hand, found the taste of his food \"unusual\" and \"different\". I guess the lamb didn't taste like the meats he's used to.  On a lark, I tried the imported Vimto grape soda. It was pretty good! A lot better than the American grape soda we had. I wanted to order another one but alas, they charged by the can.  If I ever come back here, I have to try their desserts. I wanted to, but I couldn't convince my friend to share it with me. I also have to try the appetizers but we were so hungry that we couldn't wait to have a prelude to lunch.  One more thing, for those that need this info. I don't know how halal this place is; but I didn't see or smell pork anywhere. I doubt there is any in this place, but ask, just in case. Okay?  Drink a Vimto for me, okay Yelpers?",

He has done it to me until I called him out on it.

The white patio is shaded by sail-like blue awnings which reminds you of that great trip to Greece you wish you had actually taken.  The only drawback for tall peeps is that the seating is a little lower than normal, tiled benches and cushioned stools, which leave me straining under my now heavier weight ever time I get up to leave, but... maybe I should just stay.  I have had many of the dishes on the menu here and have been satisfied on every occasion.  This is properly prepared and portioned middle-eastern food, cooked with great skill and care.  The flavors don't pop for me on every dish, but that doesn't keep me from coming back on an almost weekly basis.  Favorite dishes here are the veggie platter, the fatoosh salad and the labneh plate.  This was one of the first places I've ordered labneh and I am now a serious strained yogurt fan.  It might not sound very appetizing, but labneh is seriously good snack food and a great change from the typical hummus and baba routine.  Think thick, semi-sour cream cheese served with pita and olives.  Definitely Mediterranean, a nice snack while in your cabana.  I love the two candies they have by the register here: Turkish Delight and Cotton Candy.  The Cotton Candy is like a little spun sugar pile that resembles more of something you'd find under your bed than a dessert, but that makes all the more fun to eat as you walk out the door and return to the desert.",

The service is always fantastic and the staff will begin to recognize you if you are there often enough.  There are a few things that are a must try on the menu. First and foremost is their hummus. It is my favorite in the valley as of right now. They add a lot of garlic and the flavors will make your tongue dance, especially if you add a little sriracha. Next up, the falafel deluxe...two pita boats loaded with hummus, tahini, tabbouleh and falafel, and served with a salad or rice. So much food for around $8 and so good! The last thing that is a must try are the Greek fries. They seriously topple other places that offer a similar version of the fries.   Again, this restaurant is close to my heart. I found it after being spoiled with great Middle Eastern food in Chicago and have been extremely happy ever since my first bite.  Tana'amoo bilhayat! Talathathoo bitta'aam!",

The only downside is the pita, it's definitely not fresh baked, and tastes packaged and flavorless. The last time I ate at the Phoenicia Cafe, I tried their pistachio baklava, which is easily the best I've ever had.",

The guy at the register seemed as if he was irritated with me for asking if the bread was a pita or lavash flatbread and if I could substitute tahini sauce for tzatziki sauce. He said you mean garlic sauce and I said no tzatziki. And he wrote garlic sauce on my order and I had to correct him again....  I went for lunch and I ordered chicken shawarma sandwich, tradional baklava because they offer many flavors, and spinach pie.... First off they use cheap ingredients.   Chicken shawarma sandwich was on a pita instead of lavash flatbread, squishy thick tomatoe, chunky iceberg lettuce because it wasn't even diced all the way, and a runny tzatziki sauce. The spinach pie taste as if it was store bought not fresh at all. And my baklava was made with what taste like all peanuts.  Very disappointed. And it was my coworkers first time trying middle eastern food. I'm sure she won't give it a second chance.",

    "text": "It seems like we are not only customers who've been asked for secret \"gratitude\" at the very last second. There is literally an 15 min lasting paragraph I'd place here but I know Yelp wouldn't allow that long. So, instead I'll share the hit points of that conversation.   As we were walking out, I noticed the difference between the bill and what's written at the register. I told him what this was about and he explained with \"service\" fee which was 15%. I told him that this is exactly why I don't like coming here because you hideously charge people and get away with it. He said that he is doing it because nobody give tips to service people and he needs to take care of them. Plus, \"they are cleaning after we left, they serving and they are doing all this stuff so service fee is a must\". Then following that statement, I felt aggravated and I told him about how he is doing this off the record and nobody really knows how much you are making off of those charges and whether he is sharing it with his employees and isn't that what the waitress are hired for so why are you still asking people to pay off for it?. Then he swore and showed me some receipts and numbers written on them which he claims they are stating the tips whoever has worked that day.   Long story short, he then wanted to give our money back because he doesn't wanna argue. I said no and if there is anyone who deserves that is the waitress and she needs to get it so give it directly to her.  We then left.   I don't say anything to their food and maybe that's the only reason I go there from time to time. Plus, the waitresses are generally nice and caring and really eager to establish good and long lasting relationships with the customers, they tend to know their customers in that regard. But this guy's attitude about making more and undeserved money is off the chart. In order to claim what he is doing is right; he can even manipulate the truth and suggest that 90% of the restaurants are doing the same thing.   I'm not sure how much he is aware of how strategic location he is being at but, if you are a decent business man with high moral values because of your religion, ethnicity and background, you must act accordingly and prioritize to leave a good trademark of your professionalism and understanding of running a good restaurant; rather than a guy who is after people's extra money by charging them \"secretly\" and under the name of \"gratitude\". More interestingly, this issue has been there for almost months (as far as some reviews support that) and yet he seems ok with it.   I always prefer to be on the solution side at the end rather than getting stuck with problem. So, here is my solution;  You can spend some money on a professional designed (not hand written which you are accustomed to), visible and clear banner which inform your customers about your \"gratitude\" policy.   So that, people don't give tips \"twice\" (I'm aware you don't care but still it is ethically wrong), don't think you are trying to avoid paying taxes of what you are making \"really\" and don't worry that you are one of those individuals who has some strong signs of misrepresentation of your background which consist of ethnic, religion and moral aspects.   I think that way, you very well find a way to share that delicious food with expanded network of loyal, generous (giving tips directly to waitress type) and frequently visiting customers.",

Best menu item is definitely the gyro plate- comes with two sides and pita bread- about $9. They do charge a 20% on all dine ins, so definitely be aware of that and that's why I don't do any tip on the receipt after I pay. But a good option is ordering an entree or one of the sandwiches (gyro, schwarma, falafel) to go.

I'm giving it 2 stars because I did not appreciate the owner's, or person whom I paid my bill to at the register (appeared to be the boss or manager), attitude.  He most definitely has a very fake \"smile\" to simply this or in other words, you can tell he's ruthless and a complete ass but is compelled to show his teeth!   I ordered Greek fries, gyro, and wings; all were good nothing out of the ordinary.  Typical.  The server was good too.   Here's my issue: when I was paying I asked why my total was $22 something out of curiosity (gyro combo is $8.99 plus $5.99 for wings + tax) and the owner or manager showed an attitude.  I politely asked for a breakdown and he showed his teeth and said \"this includes service..\" I asked what he meant by \"service\"? He again appeared to want to almost wanted yell at me but showed a fake smile said \"gratuity\" as if I didn't know what that was! Instead of saying \"service\" the moron should've said gratuity and I would've understood the first time! Bottom line, F you dine in this moron will slap a 20% gratuity automatically.  I PAY TIPS very generously but DO NOT like restaurants to add this to my bill without my knowledge.  This should be an option NOT an obligation although EVERYONE must pay a good tip for good service at their own discretion, I'm a strong believer and supporter of this.  BUT a business should not be allowed to impose it.  Besides, they do this for their own interest NOT the poor servers.  Just google this, you will find out!   I may never return here again for this reason it's a matter of fairness.  They will overcharge you!",

    "text": "My friend and I ordered 2 gyro sandwiches, 1 fries with 4 small ketchup, and 2 glasses of water. My friend was paying, and the Mid-Eastern guy (in his late 50s/60s) at the cashier charged us $17.50. There was no total amount of the tab. The tab just contained the quantity of the order (2 gyro sandwiches, 1 fries, 4 ketchup, and 2 water).  In the second time we went to Phoenicia Cafe, my friend and I ordered the same thing (2 gyros, 1 fries with 4 small ketchup, and 2 glasses of water). I was paying, and the Mid-Eastern guy at the cashier charged us $18.50. The tab didn't have the total price; it just contained the quantity of the order. My friend and I were surprised and gave the cashier the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the price had changed and the cashier, who is also the owner/manager of Phoenicia Cafe, forgot to tell the waitress about the price change. The owner probably started charging customers for the ketchup.  The third time my friend and I went there, we ordered the same order (2 gyro sandwiches, 1 fries with 4 small ketchup, and 2 glasses of water). My friend was paying, and the owner/manager charged us $17.50. So, we asked him if there was price change or a charge for the ketchup. The owner/manager said the ketchup was free and there was no price change of the menu.  My friend and I are now skeptical of the tab without the amount of each food item and the total price of the order. We are also skeptical of the owner's/manager's Math calculation. So, my friend and I have stopped going to Phoenicia Cafe. We are not happy how the owner/manager runs Phoenicia cafe and does Math calculations of the order!  To all prospect customers of Phoenicia cafe, take a photo of the menu, count your order, and DO the Math calculation accurately yourself so you don't get overcharged! Do NOT rely on the Math calculation of the cashier, who is also the owner/manager of Phoenicia Cafe!",

    "text": "This is a place that every fan of Middle Eastern or Greek food should give a try at least once. It's located a brief walk north of ASU Main in Tempe and always seems to be doing well because of their great food. Lunch is the busiest so I recommend going to this place in the late afternoon. Their menu has all of the typical favorites of Middle Eastern cuisine so when you try an item for the first time, you will most likely recognize it and love it. The service is quite fast in both waiting and cooking, but they're not too keen on giving refills unless you order water. The ambience and environment is great. With painted walls murals and often times Middle Eastern channels playing on the television or music, you feel as if you have stepped into the Middle East without leaving Arizona. Connected to the restaurant is a lovely specialty grocery shop. Whenever I browse this section, I always find myself making a purchase. I have been here quite a few times and the business as whole seems to improving and progressing each time. This has definitely become one of my favorite eats in downtown Tempe. The only issue I have is that unless you go to ASU, parking is difficult to find during the early afternoon. Also, you have to pay for metered parking so remember to have some quarters ready if you want to go here.",

    "text": "I have no idea why this is also listed as a Greek place. It's all middle-eastern (Lebanese-owned, so Levantine type foods).   This place is fantastic. They make absolutely everything fresh and from scratch, including falafel (as opposed to using a dried mix and adding water before frying, they cook chickpeas and fava beans, add spices, and fry.)   They don't load up their pita wraps with many toppings compared to most other places. They are, however, happy to add extra for free.  The \"Falafel delux\" is a novel, but delicious item. It is way too much food for me to eat in a single sitting, so it's good for sharing.  My one complaint is that the basic salad costs too much given that it consists of iceberg lettuce and a pittance of other vegetables. I've only ordered it once, so maybe it was just a random occurrence.",

One night I was craving Greek fries so we decided to grab a few as well as some sides. So we grabbed a table and perused their menu. They have a lot of traditional Greek dishes but I ordered the Greek Fries and spanakopita. I asked for extra dressing and feta on my fries and let me tell you I was not disappointing. The ranch dressing they use has a bit of a bit since it has a heavy vinegar base. It compliments the saltiness of the fries as well as the feta. It is so filling that I couldn't even finish my spanakopita which was amazing. It had the perfect amount of spinach and the tzatziki was out  of this world.  The service was friendly, quick and the meal was cheap. Great deal for your money. You pay for your bill in the store which gives you a chance to buy baked items or other traditional Mediterranean foods. We love the tzatziki so much that we bought some to go as well as their ranch dressing.  Definitely check this place out and their metered parking in front of their restaurant is free after 6pm.",

I couldn't decide between the beef or chicken ~ after asking our waitress she said the chicken kabobs are more popular. Then chicken it is! So tender, moist and spot on! Highly recommend the chicken kabobs.   I ordered a side dish of the couscous simply to try it. I had the sauce put on the side. I'm so glad I did because I did not care for it at all. Sadly, they used the same liquid to cook the couscous so I could not get away from the flavor.   The hubster ordered sliced chicken in a tomato based sauce with red and green peppers. He totally enjoyed every bite. For an appetizer we ordered the chickpea hommus with pita bread. The \"hommus\", as they call it, was smooth with a definite chickpea taste and just the right amount of garlic. The disappointment was in the pita bread. It was not fresh, homemade pita bread you would expect at an authentic Mediterranean restaurant, it was store bought! Totally surprised us ~ and not in a good way.",

    "text": "5 stars- Gyro Plate or anything gyro-related 2 stars- for possible shady business practices  Came here for a stats workshop recently and had the hummus recommended to me, so I happily obliged. When a group of us got there, we were struck by the tiny booths that leave you very little leg space between you and the person in front of you. Being the smart people we are, we moved to the booth at the end that we were able to maneuver a bit to create more space.   Once the space issue was figured out, we finally ordered. Greek fries for the table, gyro plate for me and whatever else the table ordered. The gyro plate was amazing. The gyro itself was some of the best gyro meat I've ever had. The meat was so tender, super salty, and perfectly delicious. I got the side salad and hummus to go with it. The hummus was good, not the best, but good. It was a little chunky, so take that for what it's worth. To each their own. The salad was surprisingly delicious and came with a nice tzatiki dressing.   The Greek fries were also great. The fries were nice and crispy, which I always appreciate. I couldn't exactly tell what the dressing was, but it was something creamy as well. I think it was the same thing that was on the salad.  Now the bad.  When we went to pay, they overcharged all of us. I paid $12.99 for the gyro plate, $3.99 for greek fries and got charged $21.50 or something like that in the end. That means my tax was about 4.50 or 25% or so. I hadn't realized it at the time and wasn't until I actually saw my friend's bill become $9 from a $6 sandwich. I sort of ignored it because I had already been confused by Tempe taxes when I went to El Hefe where all our food came out to an even number even after taxes. I thought I was the wrong, but in the end, I realized, nope, just like others on Yelp who have noted their shady business practices, they do overcharge. Beware. They didn't even put the prices on the bill they gave us to confuse us even more.   Now that you know though, do the math and call them out. And when I actually went back by  myself the next day, I didn't get overcharged. It could be because the guy did the math wrong when he split the bill the first night we went or it could have been intentional. I honestly don't know. It seems like other people have had this experience, so I don't know what to make of it.  I went with 4 stars overall because the food is so good. Just make sure you don't get ripped off.",

I drove around the restaurant hoping there might be a free parking lot for customers,  but that wasn't the case,  I had to meter park. Once I found the entrance I was promptly greeted and given a menu, which was helpful because I'd never been here and wasn't familiar with all of the dishes.  Once my order was placed I took a look around the small market and was surprised at how many spices they carried,  they also sold couscous for cheaper than any market I've been to.  I wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to pick up my order,  no one said anything so that was a bit confusing.   The food itself turned out very delicious.  I adored the crispy falafel and the gyro meat was super tender and flavorful.  They included a bag with three Pitas which seemed a little odd. The hummus was also nice and creamy and they gave me lots of it. I feel the prices were a touch higher than they should have been,  but maybe ill just order less next time:)",

Not sure why.    Not sure if we'll come back because my husband didn't prefer the taste as the Tempe location, but for us, the Gilbert location is great and we keep going back there.

The pita bread was thin and like cardboard.  And the baklava had little honey and almost no flavor except a bitter tang (?).    On the other hand, the kibbee were fantastic (so says my wife who is a kibbee pro), and the portion large for the cost despite being called an appetizer.  The lentil soup was a cut above average, and the side sauces excelled.  I know this is a neighborhood ethnic restaurant and so I tolerate the odd layout, the cheap tables and chairs, the lack of decor, and the waitress who didn't really communicate well with us.

    "text": "I adored my experience at Phoenicia Cafe. & I could not have asked for a more pleasant eating, dining, and service experience from this quaint place.   I arrived at Phoenicia Cafe later in the evening, probably about an hour before they closed and it was the perfect time to come. We were seated right away, given waters, and our server was very accommodating.   I just moved here, so I had only been to one or two restaurants specially in this kind of food, but I can never have too many options for great falafel! And boy was it delicious. They're falafel was fried just enough and the taste was rich and easy to eat: not too fried, not dry in any way, but just right. The tahini sauce was good, for I have found it can be somewhat flavorless at some places. And the vegetables look clean and they tasted delicious. The ONLY downside to this experience, was the pita. It was a little dry and not warm. If the pita had been warm and not as kind of brittle as it was, I would have been 100% pleased with my food.   One of my friends got the vegetarian platter for which he'd never had before and scarfed it down. I watched in amazement AND he had NEVER been to this restaurant before, so I took it as solid proof that an array of their menu choices would satisfy many.   The other plate ordered was for a carnivore who scarfed down a plate for which I unfortunately do not remember the name of. When I asked how he was enjoying his food, he said very much. He had a side of yellow basmati rice that no one else got with their order that was delicious!  Lastly, I got a piece of almond and walnut baklava that was to die for. Needless to say, it was sugary, flaky but consistent and didn't annoyingly fall apart when bit into. Needless to say, I left this little gem or a restaurant knowing I will come back soon!   Oh, and there is a Halal (and not Halal) meat market and other middle-eastern specialty food items and few other novelties that were pretty cool.",

Anyway, I usually get the lamb gyro and it is delicious! The way they cook their meat makes it so soft and juicy giving it this amazing texture that just leaves you wanting more. Ive had their Wings, Pizza, Samosa's as well and it was all very good in my opinion. The staff is great as well, Ive gotten to know one of the \"waiters\" there and he's a really nice guy who really tries his best to make your experience there as positive as possible. It can get a bit pricey though and that may come as a surprise to many of you. Not so much of surprise for me, most south asian, middle eastern, and Mediterranean cuisine restaurants tend to be pricey in the US. Overall, excellent food, very good portion, excellent staff, and definitely a restaurant that I go to quite often for lunch or dinner.",

I do not agree this is the best food nor is it the best Mediterranean food.   I tried the falafel and hummus pita boat. It was a giant piece of pita bread stuffed with some fairly dry falafel, shredded iceberg lettuce and a couple of tomato slices tossed in. The hummus saved it - it was quite good, very creamy and garlicky. I asked for Greek fries since everyone says they're phenomenal but I was served regular fries. I realize our server was very busy (only server during lunch) but she never checked back so I could ask about it.  The chocolate baklava was also tasty; it is chocolate and hazelnut and had a lovely layer of just enough honey on the bottom.   Overall it was decent for the price but it certainly did not blow me away and the service was just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high? I would give the place another chance and try something else.",

I wish I hadn't waited so long once I went to the Phoenicia Cafe.  Its definitely one of the most authentic restaurants I've been to in Phx/Tempe, which is always a plus.  The restaurant  is located in a building shared with an Arabic food market, which is cool if you want to try something different to cook at home.  Besides the awesome location and atmosphere of the restaurant, the second awesome thing I noticed once I went here was the waiter, who was probably one of the nicest waiters Ive ever had.  As soon as we sat down he started making jokes and being friendly, which made us feel very welcome and friendly.  Now on to the food.  As I said, Phoenicia is a very authentic place and thus being so they have amazing Mediterranean dishes.  I love gyros, so I got the Gyro Pita Boat (i guess they also have a dish of just the gyro meat too, which ill have to try next time) and my girlfriend got the falafel and hummus.  Both of our meals were generously portioned and really flavorful, you can really taste the authentic spices they use in the gyro meat, the falafel, and the hummus, which really makes a different.  And maybe even better than the food itself was the drinks, they have fresh fruit nectar  which are amazing and go great with I would imagine anything on the menu.  To top off our dinner, we ordered Baklava for dessert.  The Baklava here, Im not exaggerating at all, is by far, the best I have ever head..it's sugary heaven.  All in all, pretty much every aspect of the Phoenicia is great, a perfect spot for lunch or dinner on campus at ASU. I definitely will be back again soon.",

This is a casual dining experience, on the edge of the ASU campus, but do not let this small, niche place deceive you! Our waitress, Hayatt (pronounced like the hotel), was one of the nicest and most welcoming waitresses we've ever had. She treats you like an old friend and does her job with a simple joy that is so refreshing! I had a combo (gyro/chicken shawarma) and the hubs had the rack of lamb. Both were excellent. The garlic sauce is aaaaaaghmazing! We had sides of hummus, French fries and basmati rice, which were all tasty. Be sure to save room for some baklava for dessert!!! They have about five/six different kinds. Ummmm good!!! We'll definitely come back next time we're in town, not just to eat Mediterranean, but to see our beautiful soul of a friend, Hayatt!",

Unfortunately, many students have discovered it's quality and price, making it a bit crowded during the semesters. Lunch can be exceptionally busy. I'm a vegetarian and can't vouch for the meat dishes, but the couscous with red sauce is wonderful as are the other vegetarian options. If you can't decide, go with the vegetarian platter: baba ganoush (though it is a bit garlic-heavy) hummus, falafel, grape leaves, tahini and tabouleh, with pita on the side. There's a Middle Eastern shop next door with imported goods. The restaurant's easy to find, as it's just south of the mosque, which has the traditional dome and minarets.",

You can choose to spend your twelve bucks on a delicious and healthy Big Mac meal deal or you can opt for an intimate little Tempe cafe that's been around since 1996 and have a complete dinner of marinated chicken kababs, basmati rice and hummus as I did one Friday night.  This place is located in the same building as Salams Market & Deli at the edge of the ASU campus.  It's a warm friendly place with a family feel to it.  I'm not sure how \"authentic\" the food is but my opinion is that it beats a Big Mac meal by a mile for about the same price.  Sure the owner seems to have a problem with warm and fuzzies but anyone who calls themselves a world traveler knows that restaurants outside of the U.S. don't always have the pasted on phony smiles we are used to here.  As far as the comments about \"forced tips\" we didn't experience that on our bill.  We did have an unexpected credit card surcharge added but lots of places do that.  I'm not going to quibble about 96 cents.  Keep an open mind and you should enjoy the Phoenicia Cafe.  Or, practice your baa'ing sound and pull into the next McD's drive-through.

After finding out that the owner was adding gratuity without informing diners I decided to stop coming here, because that's just annoying (he did it regardless of party size without telling you and I because my meal was always 5-8 dollars more than the menu price it was easy to put two and two together after reading other Yelp reviews that mentioned it).  With that being said I came here with two friends on ASU's Homecoming before the Utah game, warned them about the forced gratuity but said the food is really good. I ordered the chicken shawarma, my friend ordered a chicken shawarma pita and the other ordered a gyro + a side of kibbeh. My shawarma tasted like boiled chicken, it had absolutely no flavor. The rice was bland and the hummus tasted like paste. I am not being dramatic, this may be the worst meal I've ever had at a Middle Eastern restaurant.   To add insult to injury our server was very curt, she was not a pleasant person. That might be due to being the only server there on a Saturday afternoon during ASU's busiest home game in two months and she had to cover both inside and out. I don't know though, we only went here because we knew it wouldn't be as crazy as the other places for a wait but I will never return now due to the food just not being good compared to Haji Baba or Princess Market and the service being even worse than the food.",

A tip is something I always do and I look forward to adding myself. So, I'm unsure as to why the change. Just felt it necessary and maybe helpful to mention to others in the community.",

This is outrageous!  Why am I paying a service charge to give them my business?  If they need more money for their product, they should be transparent and raise their prices by 3.5%.

We mentioned the huge sign out front that said $5, and he said \"that's take out only\". I told him it didn't say that on the sign, and he tried to argue with me. We had also mentioned that we wanted the $5 shawarma sandwiches to the waitress and she did not tell us it wasn't $5, she even wrote $5 on our ticket to take to the register.  $2 isn't much, but the fact that this guy tries to overcharge (please read other people's posts) and has terrible customer service is ridiculous.

I also tried the \"hommus deluxe\" with chicken today. That's the creamiest hummus I've ever had. Wow, so flavorful and the chicken was grilled perfectly. My girlfriend and I shared and still had extra falafel and hummus.   I usually get a gyro pita boat. I've never had a gyro with so much meat...a definite plus for me. Wait, I lie, the chicken schwarma at Pita Jungle is comparable in size and filling. Maybe I'll go there tomorrow.  Back to the matter at hand. This place is mighty tasty and cheap to boot. The service, in my experience, has always been good, if not great.

I usually get the hommus and shish kabob sandwich. mmmmm  Tender meat bits that have been roasting on a stick on a soft pita with a ton of garlicky hommus pickles and fresh veggies....  I've tried most of their sandwiches and they're all great. I have not tried their dessert and service there is eh-eh depends on who you get, but really go and enjoy the food dont let all the rest distract an enjoyable meal ... I will continually go back this is my middle eastern spot :)  Edit- I had the vegetarian falafel on my last visit!

    "text": "Something wrong with watching the war on the news, hearing about  Israel bombing the shit out of Gaza, and a Palestinian girl serving you dinner at the same time. That is precisely what I did tonight at Phoenicia, though not exactly on purpose.   The first thing we noticed walking in is how surprisingly nice and clean the place is for a middle eastern restaurant. Seriously, it's really tidy. The second thing I noticed is how odd the waitress was acting. She had to be on something crazy. She was practically running to do things and there were only 3 tables in the place, all busy eating... just bazaar. She was not very friendly but a competent waitress nonetheless. She said things like \"you ready yet?\" and \"give me your cup so I can get you more soda.\" Whatever, at least she was doing her job well.   I had the shish kafta which is basically a shisk kebob in a sandwich form. It was very good with a nice mix of veggies and good hummus. The only complaint from me is the lettuce they used was of mediocre quality, and I like the way they built it, with the veggies on the inside. Nothing is worse than when your veggies all fall off because they don't have anything to hold them in. What a novel idea, put the meat on top and use that to hold everything in there. I can't believe I've never thought of that myself when I make pita sandwiches. Leave it to the Mexicans, those buggers can figure out how to make a rocket ship out of duct tape and cat hair I swear.  Side story, I had to replace a window screen on my 3rd floor and I called like 10 screen companies and none of them would do it. Finally I got the nerve to buy a screen at Home Depot and pay a Mexican to put it on. He and a friend climbed the damned tree out front and put it on a stick. While holding it in place with one stick, they used another one to turn the fasteners and lock it into its fittings. Fucking a.... 10 professionals couldn't do it, but the first Mexican day laborer I get figures it out in 5 minutes.   This was a good experience and I'd definitely go back. It's inexpensive, easy to get to via train, and clean. Next time I want to try something more substantial as I'm still a little hungry, but my fat ass needs to cut down on portions anyway.",

    "text": "I'm a student at ASU and I've been coming to Phoenicia regularly over the past years but that ends today! I only eat halal food so Phoenicia I have always been a regular at Phoenicia because of their proximity to campus and the mosque. I've never had problems in the past but in recent months I've noticed some disturbing practices.  I'm the type of person that orders only a few dishes regularly so I've pretty much got the price + tax of my favorites seared into my brain after so many years. In the last few months, I noticed that these prices began fluctuating. One week I would pay what I regularly pay and then the following week I would pay 2 dollars more for the same meal. When I asked about it, they're excuse was I got refills although they never charged me for refills before!  I decided to experiment. I kept my receipt from last week and ordered the EXACT same meal today. I had no drink last week and no drink today so the refill excuse wouldn't fly. The manager rang me up to $9.60 although I paid $7.71 last week. I stepped outside, analyzed the two receipts to make sure they were exactly the same and came back in the confront the manager. The manager was gone when I came back so I asked the waiter about the differences in the receipt. The waiter became visibly nervous, excused himself and came back telling me it was tax. I showed him through a tax calculating app on my phone that that isn't possible. I asked to see the manager and he excused himself again. He came back telling me the manager is too busy to see me! I was so angry but I didn't want to cause a scene over a couple bucks so I took the loss and left.  It is really disturbing that a business would conduct itself so dishonestly! I'm not the only person this has happened to and I hear complaints about being over charged for meals all the time! Consider this a warning to anyone going to eat at Phoenicia. If you do decide to go, confirm your checks!!",

A friend invited me, I was excited to try something new so we made a go of it.  I had the gyros pita, which was pretty good.  Not the best ever, not the best in Phoenix metro. But it was still good.  My friend went with the Lentil soup and the vegetarian platter (Tabouleh, Hummus and Babaganoush served with a generous pile of pita bread).  I tried the hummus and babganoush and I'm more partial to Cafe Istanbul on both counts but to each their own.    The place was clean, I liked the yellow and purple tables a lot and the service was decent.  They have fresh squeezed carrot juice which I enjoyed quite a bit.  The water however was unfiltered tap water and awful in the way that all Tempe tap water is consistently awful.",

    "text": "Sorry fellow Yelpers, but I went yesterday and I just did not experience what you all did.  The atmosphere was a quaint little locally owned place with a bakery/grocery attached and lively music which I loved-GREAT change of place from all the corporate and bland white bread places in the Valley. The food however....ehhhhh...not so much. I consider myself and afficando of Greek/Mediterranean/Persian food and have been on the hunt since moving to Phoenix from Chicago and we pretty dissapointed eating here.  Nothing was bad...but nothing was great either.  The Masa we ordered lacked flavor as the cheese was mozzerella and the olives just black, not even kalamata or anything.  The fattoush deluxe was heavy on the chicken and light on the salad (great for the big meat eaters out there) but it was simply too much chicken that was just average and a bit dry.  The fattoush was dressed in a homemade dressing that would have been very good had they not doused the salad in it-way to heavy handed for what is supposed to be a light/refereshing salad. The greek fries were disappointing to say the least....frozen fries straight out of the bag and into the deep fryer.  True greek fries should be handcut and a bit thicker to hold onto their feta counterpart- they also tasted a bit bland as they lacked any oregano. The chicken kabob pita was also \"just there\" nothing to send back to the kitchen but certainly nothing to come back for.  I was let down Yelpers, send me some place where the guy in the kitchen is called Dimitri, Costantinos or George, not Manuel.",

There are a lot of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern places out there but hanging a few pictures on the walls and putting Hummus on the menu does not automatically make it so. This place is for real. Coming from NYC and Brooklyn i had ate at my fair share of this kinda places and this one surely keeps up the mark.   Think of a college town joint and prices with Scottsdale taste. Service was great too - Never annoying but we could see the guy glancing at our table often to note if something was needed. They even let us keep the car in their lot as we went on exploring neighborhood.   Not a damn thing bad about this place.  Why not 5 stars? I think it could be a bit more authentic and a bit less cheesy. But in reality it does not matter when food shows up.   \"I like\"",

I love the hummus with chicken, the shish kabobs, and the gyros. I can camp on the patio with the deluxe hummus all afternoon.   The decor is basic diner laminate and flourescent lighting, but it was clean, and the patio and big windows count for major points.",

Finally went for lunch today with friends and was really happy we did. Attentive, quick service, super yummy food. Had the falafel which wasn't dried out, in the pita boat, which is just their pita sandwich..it was pretty gigantic. Friend had a gyro combo, which she was pleased with. And their baklava is to die for..some of the best I've ever had. I think their pita is homemade too..stretchy and fresh.

Does it mean I get my food in 15 minutes and be expected to inhale it in 3 and then pay in the other two? Or do I get it to go?   In any case, it wasn't the owner saying this. It was a college kid, probably more interested in the finer aspects of life, like playing some serious PS3 or watching Family Guy reruns. It was hot outside and I wasn't all that motivated to try and think of where else nearby to eat (it wasn't going to be PF Chang's, I can tell you that much).   \"I'll get a chicken kebab plate with rice & hummus to go, then.\"  In the interim, I got to survey the inside. Some random Arabic Islamic calligraphy here and there, interspersed with bright splashes of Suns colors on the walls, Suns pennants, and countless photographs of loyal patrons all over by the register. There seemed to be pleasant enough seating outside, too - although I don't know if they have water misters for the summer heat or not.   I eventually got my food and brought it home. Two grilled spears of chicken kebabs, ample rice and hummus, two pitas, and a little container of, WOAH! THAT'S GARLIC! sauce.  The food was good, although the chicken was a little on the dryer side. Can't really remark on the service as I ate at home, but the owner, who was tending shop in the adjoining Salam Market, was friendly.  So all in all, decent enough Middle Eastern place. Not the best I've had here but nothing stuck out as being bad either. I'll come back again and try some other dishes sometime down the road, but I'll be sure to give myself more than 20 minutes leeway next time around.",

They looked perfect (see pics)   Boy are looks deceiving, I bit into soaking sticky wet Goosh, it was so soggy and stale at the same time, I literally spit it out along with the next bite of the pistachio piece, both not worthy of swallowing, it was that bad!

The portions are very generous and I've never been able to finish an appetizer and meal.  Generally I split the hommus and lebne with a coworker, we each get a meal, and we take most of everything home as delicious leftovers.  Check out the bakery, the baklava is decent and it's cheap- plus they have varieties that I have never seen, like almond/hazelnut.  And you can't go wrong with fresh, warm pita!  Recommended:  Hommus, Hommus Deluxe with Lamb, Lebne (best I've ever had), Shish Kabob pita combo (comes with a drink and fries for $7.99), and the Gyro Platter.",

This time the meat was cooked perfectly.   The vegetarian app plate is also pretty fantastic. I love the fact that they don't go salt-crazy here at Phoenicia. Okay, I'm not a  huge fan of their  hummus, but that doesn't mean it's not good, it's just not fantastic.  On the  other hand, the Baba Ganouj WAS fantastic.  The lady who served us recommened a lamb / beef burger, so I had that.  the meat was lovely and very delicately seasoned.  It could have been a bit bigger, but what the heck. I do recommend that they change the bun that goes with it.  The bun had a kind of a flaky texture and was almost sweet, and it really didn't work with the burger.  The chicken shwarma salad was beautiful.  I'm drooling as I type.  I'm sad that I didn't check in when I went...I could have gotten a free sandwich!   I could say more, but I'm getting hungry.  Update:  I went again with two different people this time.  I ordered a pita boat that was a mix of baba gaoouj and tabouli that was so good it made me want to cry.  PLEASE TRY IT!!  4.5 stars now!!

An apparent patron in front of me in line, was talking to the owner about heartburn before I placed the order. The patron said I could go next, but I let them finish their conversation.  I waited and listened to them (two middle-eastern foreigners conversing), and the owner said something about \"alveria oil\" would be helpful for his heartburn and wrote something down on a piece of paper.  Anyway, I then ordered the Falafel de Luxe, the owner said to put my tip in the jar on the left, and I then waited about 15-20 minutes. A little strange vibe in there at that point. When I got back to my office, I remember sitting down and  eating the meal they ended up handing me, but really felt awful afterwards and thereafter became sick. This place needs some type of food inspection, in my opinion. Buyer beware.",

    "text": "Okay there is a major problem with this restaurant. I have eaten here twice about one year apart and the same thing happened twice. I ordered a ten dollar plate of beef shawarma each time and my friends being college students as well ordered items in that price range. After we finished eating, we asked for our check and we received a incomprehensible handwritten receipt (which is fine since small businesses don't always have the resources for itemized checks). We take it up to the owner managing the register, who was very pleasant to begin. He asked us if we wanted to split our check and we told him to go ahead. He made a large show of inputting items into his register and calculating our individual bill on an adjacent calculator. When he was all done, each of our bill was around 22 dollars! My plate was 10 dollars. I asked him point blank, did you add a tip to our bill? He said no and extended his hand for my card. I was quite ready to argue but my friends were not, so I let it go and was overcharged 12 dollars along with a 5 dollar tip that I left. And the second time, I went with two friends and I kept a close eye this time. Two shawarma plates and a shawarma sandwich should be $35 at the most. Our combined total was somehow calculated by him to be 47 dollars and once again he did his math and our individual total was 17 dollars. This time I kept pressing him about whether or not he had added gratuity to our bills and he denied it. I asked our waitress to please bring us the menu and go over the charge with him, and then his demeanor changed. He looked visibly upset and irate, almost like he was ready to lash out at any second. The food is good enough to come back twice and even if it was worth 17 dollars, I don't like being swindled. Before writing this review, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau of Arizona, and if this has happened to you, please do the same.",

The chicken gyro was delicious and worth the price, but the Greek fries were bitter, soggy, and awful! I recommend getting regular french fries, which is a shame since feta cheese is delicious and paired nicely with fries. It's not with it to eat the sauce unless you REALLY like soggy fries.   Service was fine, they hire collage students or high schoolers, i couldn't tell but they were certainly young. It was understandable that my waitress wasn't attentive, because it was a busy time of lunch. However, if the service is always like that, I wouldn't recommend this place.
