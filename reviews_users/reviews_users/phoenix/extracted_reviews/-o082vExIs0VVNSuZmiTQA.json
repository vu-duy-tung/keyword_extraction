    "text": "WOW......the most authentic Mexican food I have had since eating my mother-in-laws home cooking.....sorry Nellie, Frank and Lupe' is better! A cute charming hole in the wall. If you are looking for upscale or Americanized Mexican food.....do not go here. If you are looking for the BEST authentic home cooked Mexican food, this is the place! Their beans are out of this world, not completely mashed and nicely smokey tasting. Their Spanish rice was the best I have ever tasted, not heavy on the tomato sauce at all but super flavorful. I also had a tamale that was again better than my M-I-L's and up to this point no one could make them as good as she does. The enchilada was good and OH MY the chips and salsa. The chips are thick but very crunchy and the salsa was amazing, not too spicy with a terrific flavor. I have seen reviews about poor service and bugs.....we saw NONE of that and the place was FULL.  The prices are also very reasonable. My combination plate that included a chili relleno, taco, tamale, enchilada rice and beans AND two sopapillas was only 13.75 and I had enough to take home for lunch the next day. If you truly know your Mexican food and love home style cooking, this is the place to beat!",

The sopaipillas were very tasty and had a little bit of kick to them. I wish I had more when I left, even after I was able to eat half of my wifes.  Last night, I went with my wife and another couple for Happy Hour.  Happy hour is 4-6 pm and half price appetizers and margaritas.  AWESOME!   We enjoyed our food and drinks on the cool patio area.   The margaritas were very good and went down easy. As for the food, we went with the mini tacos, cheese crisp and mini chimicangas. The cheese crisp and chimichangas served with salsa, guacamole were good. I was a bit disappointed by the mini tacos. They were okay, but not great. Seemed like something you got at Costco, dropped in the fryer and served. Not much behind them.  The service was really good. Our drinks came out quickly after each order. The food took longer though. Given the food was just appetizers, I thought the food should arrive quicker. The food took upwards of 20 minutes.    Overall, 3.5 stars.  I plan to head back and have an actual dinner next time.",

Frank & Lupe's falls in the first category, appealing to the knick knack buyers after they are done shopping and have worked up an appetite.  That said, I thought I should try it on a Tuesday night with no plans. My initial reaction after seeing the drapes in the dining room was I would be in for an overpriced-underflavored meal that would only appeal to someone from Nebraska. Quite the contrary. I proclaim Frank & Lupe's one of the best (border style) Mexican restaurants in the Valley. The Green Burro owned and acutually contained fresh green chiles. their chips and salsa were also very tasty. The biggest surprise? the price was right in line with your Arriba, Abuelo's, Macayo's, etc. No complaints there.  The reason for the downgrade from four stars? the service. Quite frankly, the server, and server assistant that were assigned to our table were inattentive at best. They made no effort to give us exceptional service, and worst of all, every time I emptied my water glass they asked if I wated more. It's empty isn't it?",

    "text": "This was my second time here and I will say that the first time I went, it was such a great experience. The second time wasn't as good. My friend wanted a good mexican joint to eat with his family after his graduation. We had a large party of about 7 and so we called in advance. The lady on the phone said that they do not take reservations and that you just have to come in and wait. We were ok with until we showed up and then there was a large enough table that was empty that we could sit at; however the lady said that it was reserved and taken. I let her know that we just were told you can't make reservations and that you had to wait. This obviously upset us even more because the table that could have easliy sat our group was empty for at least another 10 minutes. Then 1 person showed up for the table and remained mainly empty for another 15 miutes at least. We were still waiting to be seated 30 minutes later.   The food server forgot one of our peoples food and brought it out later. I should also mention that the food took at least 45-60 minutes to get too. They did apologize on that but didn't seem to offer anything in return.   Although this place upset myself on my second visit and also upset the other people in the party, I still like the food here. It's a romantic setting (Back patio) and quality and filling food. If I had to rate just the service aspect I would give it 1 star, but since I am taking into consideration the food to go along with my first visit here, I give it 3 STARS.   Let's hope that my next visit goes better.",

    "text": "The back patio at Frank and Lupes is such a gem to have in old town. As you walk down a small alleyway, you feel like you're walking in to a small family owned restaurant in a coastal town in Mexico. You're surrounded by walls painted with murals, a small bar, old school hanging corona signs, and not to mention great food. Really... nothing beats eating good Mexican food under the stars.  What I personally recommend:  Get the #1, it's the combination plate. It comes with a pork tamale, a rolled enchilada, a taco, rice, beans, and two sopaipillas. What I do is ask to sub the taco to a chicken taco. I also get my plate covered in red sauce. Ask for a side of salsa with your #1 to dip or pour on top.  Their chips and salsa are great. Many times I get served chips right out of the fryer in my basket. Their salsa is fantastic, and it's very fresh. One of my favorites in AZ. The only downside is their change in policy. In the past you used to get unlimited baskets of chips. Now you get 1 free basket, and I think every basket after that is $2.50. This is crazy in my mind, chips should be free. I asked one server why they started to charge, and he said it's because many people would just leave the chips on their table without touching them. What a weak excuse! Instead of charging, just ask initially if they would like chips. Their policy is just to get extra money...  Frank and Lupes gets 5 stars for food, 3.5 stars for service, and 2 stars for their policy. Their food is really good, so I cannot give this place anything lower than a 4.",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice now - both times with a small group (party of 5 once and a party of 12 or so last night). I've sampled more than a few dishes and I've decided that they earn about a 3.5 for food and service (which is a bump up from my original assessment). I've given them a 4 because of their ambiance - specifically the back patio.   First off - the food. Everyone likes to argue over what \"authentic\" mexican food is and people bitch about how this or that restaurant isn't authentic so it's not good. That's a bunch of horse shit. Mexico is largely a poor country (as well as being fairly large) and their affluent areas have cuisine influenced by Europe while the rest of the country varies wildly depending on the region.   Authentic Mexican food is a mixture of cheap and fresh and spicy. They use foods that absorb flavors well and they use whatever is available that they can afford. The spices originated out of a need to cover up the fact that you weren't eating the best cut of meat or whatever. Authentic Mexican food isn't even that good or particularly good for you - if you spent some time deep in Mexico, you would be shitting your intestines out 6 times a day for a month or two until you got used to it.  Anyway - The argument really annoys me. You want authentic, then you should go to one of those shitty diarrhea inducing taco stands that litter the valley and that are run by authentic illegal Mexicans and that are often getting shut down for serving cat meat or for too many health code violations. Everything is made with lard and/or comes from a giant can and/or is cooked in a vat. Authentic. Enjoy.  This place is as authentic as any except they thankfully probably use higher quality ingredients as do most places in the valley. I guess compared to other local joints claiming to be authentic - I'd say this is closer in flavor to what you might expect from a higher end restaurant in Mexico than Tee Pee or whatever.   I grade Mexican food places mainly on 3 things - their chips and salsa, their shredded beef, and their margaritas. I don't eat beans, so I try to ask a friend who does what they thought so I have some perspective on that. I also try to test out their chicken, cheese and guacamole on a second visit.   Frank and Lupe's chicken was flavorless as was their cheese... they put it in a mole sauce which was decent. Their Margaritas weren't very strong, but tasted okay - they gave me a headache and put me to sleep when I got home. The beef had too much 'stuff' in it and I wasn't happy when I ate that. Some places cook their beef in stuff for flavor and then just serve the beef while others cook the beef and then mix it with cooked veggies and stuff for flavor. I'm a fan of the former rather than the latter.   Their chips were decent, but nothing special. The salsa was pretty spicy (when we asked for the hot), but it didn't have as much flavor as I like. So basicaly I wasn't wowed by Frank and Lupe's - I just thought it was \"ok.\" The service was decent - everyone was very nice, but be prepared to wait for a long time. This place doesn't do fast.   Going to the back patio here is really nice when the weather is good or on a cool evening. It's a great little spot and a solid choice for dinner or a group having drinks and snacks before going clubbing. It beats the shit out of Pink Taco and Tee Pee though.   Fun fact: they don't take reservations (so they say) if the party is smaller than 20.",

Lupe and Frank's son Eddie spent time with us at our table and gave us a tour of the old house that is used for special occasions and celebrity privacy. He took us over to his families Monday night tradition and we were able to meet Frank & Lupe as well as more family and friends. This restaurant has heart and soul pored into every dish and in every nook and cranny. All the recipes are Lupe's \"except the fish\" she said. Don't think twice about trying this place, you'll be back if you do. The patio is our favorite place to dine in.

With some family in town we decided to try it again.  It had been about nine months since our last visit.  During that last visit the service was so bad we wrote the place off.  This current visit made us run for the proverbial hills.  We will not return short of EVERY other Mexican restaurant within the 500 mile radius closing.    We got there on a busy Saturday around 5:30pm and just beat the crowd.  They said the patio had a 45 minute wait even though more than half of the tables were empty.  We asked if they were waiting for reservations on the empty tables, we were told they don't take reservations.  As we sat there, two different people walked up the hostess and asked if he could find their waiters.  All signs we should have caught.    After waiting 20 minutes, I walked around the to the front and found the inside of the place almost 100% empty.  I asked the host inside if the tables were open and he said yes.  Okay, no mention of the 10 open seats inside to anyone waiting on the patio.  So we moved inside along with about 3/4th of the people waiting with us outside.    After we sat nobody came to the table for a good 10 minutes.  We had to grab someone.  After we did, it took another 5 minutes before they made it to the table.  You could see why sitting there.  They had two waiters for the entire inside.  OK, the inside it small and it would probably work if the two poor guys didn't have to cover the bar, that had no bartender, and make drinks for their tables AND for the bar, in-between serving.  This all going on while the hostess stood in place and never lent hand.   The only time I saw him doing anything was then two irate people from different tables berated him about their lack of service.  Two more tables around us didn't waste their breath and just got up and left.    Our waiter came back once, about 20 minutes after we got there and took our food order.  Our drinks were dry and chip basket was empty.  No refills, no chips.  He didn't even inquire about us wanting more.    20 minutes later our food came from a different server/runner and we never talked to our waiter again.    We then couldn't get our bill for anything.  Personally, I would have just got up and left but the other people didn't want to pull a 'dine and dash'.    The last thing I'll mention is the filth.  I make it a general practice to not try to look at the state of the Mexican places I go to, especially the kitchens, but at this one the grossness just jumped out.  I won't go into details, but I stopped eating my burrito about half way though after seeing the kitchen door being held open by an employee for a few seconds.    It's a shame.  This place was a gem in Old Town and I recommended it many times.  It seems the times have passed it by.  While the staff works their under-staffed butts off, the management has obviously given up and the place is being run into the ground.  I see a Kitchen Nightmares in it's future.    Consider yourself warned.",

My friend asked for a bourbon on the rocks and the waitress said they didn't have bourbon. So then he asked for a rum drink and she said they had no rum. I find this hard to believe because they have a full bar out in back. We were having a good meal but then the music came on and was so loud we had to shout across the table to each other. We asked them three times to turn it down and the waitress seemed put off by it. This really spoiled a good dinner. I would have given them 4 stars but the poor service knocks it down to a 2. It amazes me when restaurants don't realize that service is just as important as the food.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of fellow native New Mexicans living in the Phoenix area, constantly searching for Mexican or New Mexican food that even HOLDS A CANDLE to what we eat at home. We basically consider ourselves Mexican food experts. We know what we're doing! Lol  I do have to say Frank and Lupe's puts up a good fight. I go into each Mexican joint with pretty low expectations, because I've been disappointed so many times in the past. But I was indeed pleasantly surprised!  Sat on the patio and loved it -- great atmosphere! Love the decor and lights in the palm trees. My group of friends ordered a pitcher of margaritas and were quite pleased. I ordered the combination plate with a rolled enchilada, tamale, a chile relleno, and a taco -- I wanted to sample several items at once. Oh and I ordered it with hot red chile sauce covering the plate.   Surprisingly, the red sauce tasted pretty close to what we eat in NM. I've heard lots of horror stories about Mexican restaurants passing off tomatoe-y sauces as red sauce. I was worried about what I'd actually get on my plate. But no, again, the sauce gets a thumbs up from me! The relleno was perfect, gloriously greasy and stuffed with gooey white cheese -- right on!   And the tamale was actually BETTER than most I've had back home! The masa surrounding the meat had this amazing texture to it and wasn't too dry or too moist. (I've had a lot of shitty tamales in my life!)   NOTHING outside of New Mexico is truly truly truly up to my standards lol. But Frank and Lupe's is, by a landslide, the best Mexican food I have had in my 6 months living in Arizona. I think I have finally found a place to satisfy my cravings and homesickness!",

We waited in line behind one couple for a long time without being acknowledged. Finally they were seated and the host continued to ignore us. When we got his attention he said it would be 20-30 more until he could seat us. We were shocked as there were two open tables. He told us those were for groups of four and we were only two!  When we pushed the issue the bartender weighed in and agreed that we couldn't be seated. I was so angry and will not return. I guess zero guests are better than two?!?",

    "text": "We are at Frank and Lupe's last week. Sat on the patio and the host who sat us spilled a huge bowl of salsa next to our table. The salsa heavily splattered all over me drenching the entire back of my shirt from top to bottom, my hair and the front and back of my jeans. My actual back, which was covered by my shirt, was wet with salsa. It was gross. Our server was also present when it happened; however, he did not say a word of apology or offer anything to us.   The host offered me a little napkin, which was a joke as I literally had salsa all over me. I asked for a towel to wipe off all the salsa and the host came and started lifting the back of my shirt to clean it. I asked him to stop and asked my friend to help instead. The host seemed like he was drunk or on something- He wasn't acting normal. He apologized and asked if there is anything he can do. I suggested that he could discount or comp my meal as I now had to race home to change my entire outfit and wash the salsa out of my hair before our next destination. He said no.   Later he approached our table and (without asking) suddenly started pouring something random from a plastic cup into my margarita and said \"I can do this!\". I tried to stop him as he was pouring it. I had no idea what he was even pouring into my glass and honestly wondered if he was pouring his own drink into mine. It was weird!   He later came back and tried to do the same thing before I stopped him from touching my glass. I didn't even want to drink it afterwards as I had no clue what he poured into it. I tried to be a good sport about the major salsa disaster as I did not want to ruin my night with friends, but I feel the server, host, or manager should have offered something as an apology and show of good customer service. I understand that accidents happen, but offering a free meal to a customer that your employee drenched in salsa is a necessity if you want to have return business. But, nope, we were charged full price for everything, including our tainted margaritas.  It was my first time at Frank and Lupes. I was with friends who love the place, but I had a terrible experience there and felt I was mistreated as a customer. Based on my experience, I would not return nor would I recommend this restaurant.",

When we got there the place was packed, we were told there'd be a wait of up to 30 mins. Heard good things and wanted to stay. My party of four waited at the bar n enjoyed margaritas. I don't think we waited more than half a margarita before we were seated.   We were given menus, water, and chips n salsa immediately. The chips were freshly made and the salsa was delicious. I had the combo plate because I couldn't decide what I wanted. It hit the spot! Everything was tasty and flavorful down to the rice n beans. Others had the fish tacos and two different kinds of steak tacos. Everything was finished except I couldn't finish all mine and gladly took home some leftovers.  Overall this place is really good. The staff were all friendly. There's a really fun and well decorated back patio.The food was awesome. Margaritas did the job. Definitely recommend this place and will be back for sure.",

I walked here from the Valley Ho with some girlfriends, we were craving some Mexican food after a pool day.   The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was spicy like I like it.  I got fish tacos, which I like to try everywhere because they are my favorite. I like that the fish was grilled, but the tacos could not be picked up because they were so soggy. I had to eat them with a fork and knife, which wouldn't have been bad but they didn't wow me. The beans and rice were better actually. The price was good for the amount of food though, $12 for 3 fish tacos, rice and beans.   You can customize any dish which was nice for my vegan friend.  I wanted to try and margarita because they looked great, huge fishbowl glasses. It looks like happy hour may be the time to try those.  Another thing I thought was weird was that there was 6 of us but our server said he could only split the bill 3 ways maximum. Good thing most of us had cash, still strange in this day and age though.  I thought it was good and I would go back to that patio again without persuasion, but not topping my list for Mexican food.",

I'm from New Mexico, so what I love most about the menu is that they serve sopapillas and stuffed sopapillas, both of which are hard to find beyond NM state lines. If you aren't afraid of a hearty meal, I highly recommend the Frank or Lupe enchilada plate.  The enchilada is crowned with egg - mmm!  Last night we had the special: chile relleno with poblano cream sauce.   It was massive, so between that and the complementary chips and salsa, my boyfriend and I had more than enough to eat.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  The small storefront facing Marshall Way has limited seating, but if you walk to the back of the parking lot you'll find another building and outdoor patio.  It's a great spot for sipping margaritas after a day of sight-seeing or having drinks and appetizers before a night on the town.  It can accommodate large groups as well.  In the winter they have heat lamps to make temps tolerable.  Opinions and styles of Mexican food vary widely in the Valley, but for me Frank & Lupe's is like a reliable old friend from home.",

They didn't have many drink options that weren't soda or alcohol. When I asked the waiter said \"lemonade?\" (surprised they didnt say they had horchata!). The lemonade was literally a glass of tap water with one half of lemon juice and barely any sugar, for about $4. I ordered one of the cheapest meals they had since i wasn't so hungry, it was a plate of beef tacos with beans and rice for about $9-$10. Good amount of food for the price but the meat felt hard and a little overcooked in my opinion. The rice and beans were good though. I was in a group of about 8 people, and when they brought the bill it was only one bill....they didn't split it for us (so someone in the group who ordered a handful or margaritas decided to split the bill evenly with everyone even though i had ordered the least amount! just my luckkkkkkk right?)

We had one server taking orders and when food came he had some help but otherwise it was just one person. What such a large group size we understood we would need to wait a little bit, but what was most unfortunate was that the food came out and it was only slightly warm and my order was not as it was described on the menu. I let my server know that I was not as concerned about my order but that he should be more concerned that our guest of honor was clearly not happy.  Adding an automatic 20% gratuity for a large group is acceptable in most cases, however, i wasn't happy to pay it, though I did. Despite the cold meals, the only extra that was provided to the group was a free shot for the birthday girl. I gave 2 stars with hopes that it was just a fluke. I would try this place again, though only with a small group.",

And although I like their standard salsa that comes to the table complimentary, I LOVE their secret stash of hot salsa (you have to ask for it).  Not everything hits the bulls eye with me, but for the most part, F&L is good eats!  Their Santos Lounge is pretty cool and has a pretty impressive menu of tequila.

I guess it's a family business since forever and they all work there. He chatted the whole time and was so friendly, helpful, and accommodating. I couldn't decide on their huge menu so he brought some sauces go try. The poblano sauce is really good. You can't go wrong with the poblano enchiladas. My only negative was the chips and salsa was not very good. Otherwise it had great food and drinks and ownership!",

I went with my dad for his birthday because this is one of his favorite places to eat. I enjoyed the patio atmosphere also and hope the next time I'm in Arizona to eat here again.   The only problem I have with  the place is that the service was awful. Seriously, the worst. I would give the service 1 star or LESS .The waiter acted as though he was distracted the whole time. He never re-filled our chips. It took over 20 minutes to bring us our drink order (diet soda and ice tea) and we never got re-fills on our drinks either. He barely made contact with us to take our order. Thankfully I didn't have any questions for him because I'm not sure he would have stopped to answer them if I had. They were busy but only with a Sunday crowd. We didn't go on a weekend night when I expect delays and distracted waiters. This was at 5:00 on a Sunday. Thankfully their food is good and the atmosphere is nice because otherwise I wouldn't recommend this place based on service alone.  I just saw on some other yelper's review that chips and salsa are only free the first round. REALLY?  Maybe I won't be back.",

I was sitting out on the patio with my brothers and their family and we got our drink order then about 20 minutes later we got to order our food. The server then did not ever come back to us until about an hour later and he said I am sorry the kitchen lost your food order. This would have been ok, if he was attentive and came back periodically to check on us, but alas he did not. He comped the drinks because I asked. I understand being busy, but as a former server, check on all your tables ever 10 to 15 minutes. I chose to leave and get a meal at home delivered by Postmates as I figured that would be faster. I used to eat here all the time because I worked at the Howard Johnson right behind it. These things happen, but not being attentive to your tables is inexcusable from a former waiter. Please do try working on this. At least the chips were good. Hope it gets better for the people who stayed.",

The waiter never brought us water the whole time we were there, after we had finished drinking our margaritas and chips and salsa we had to flag someone down after 15 minutes of sitting there empty to order 2 more! (And we were paying full price for them, not happy hour.)  The service was probably the worst we have had here. Never came over once to check on us, we had to go get someone if we needed something. Food was alright, we ordered the fajita burrito and it was small and not super flavorful. It was nothing to rave about.  The drinks were really good, and that's why I'm giving the 2 stars.  We also wanted to get dessert and unfortunately... we had a nice long black hair baked into our sopapilla.  Overall it was just a really bad experience and we normally like coming here and getting green chili and margs. Don't know if we will be returning unfortunately.",

What I ordered did not look like a enchilada at all. And my waitress forgot the poblano sause and when I asked about it she was very rude and denied that I ever asked for it. Horrible customer service. There was berly any shaded beef on my so called enchilada. So skimpy. I also got sopapillas that were just plain old bread with nothing elts on them. I was told that I could not have sugar and cinnamon. I don't understand why if I'm paying for it.   For desert   I ordered flan. Worst presentation ever. They were small dinky prices. They were tastes so so dry and did not taste fresh. I have never had flan that bad in my whole life. El rancho and food city have more soft creamy flan then here.   I came with a party of 6 people answer none of use liked our food. Drove all the way from mesa just to try it out. Needles to.say say we will never come back with the bland food and the bitchh waitress.   One thing I will give them is that they have good salsa and chips. But that's about it.",

Six mini chimis, cream fresca, pick, and guacamole make up the plate. The chimis were meaty and tasty. We were to full for dinner. Yes, we would go again.",

It was not the servers fault but he was very rude and u apologetic and even hot I  a argument with the lady at the table. He kept saying he didn't feel bad because it wasn't his fault. He probably said that about 7 times and he kept escalating the situation. I understand it wasn't his fault but he works for the service industry and should of said sorry and let tit be instead of making a scene and not showing a ounce of emotion. He was very Rude an d it made the entire difference nervous uncomftorbale. A manager never came out to apologize to the ladies at the table or anything it was pathetic. There was a server who helped them at the end who was amazing g he was a tall skinny male he was amazing but he was the only friendly face that I saw in that place.   The food was OK...

This was by far the best Mexican food I've ever eaten (albeit were from the Midwest). The chips were so light and airy and the salsa tasted amazing with great consistency - not too spicy but it had a nice kick to it. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and loved it! The rice that came with it was delicious too! My wife ordered the (3) soft tacos and ate them all - she never does that. And my brother had a combo and he raved about the tamales. The service was average, and the meals were costly ($55 for 3 of us) but other than that we were very satisfied and would recommend checking out Frank and Lupe's to anyone visiting Scottsdale. AZ!",

    "text": "First time and definitely will N.O.T. return. Food was mediocre. Service was extremely poor. And price was nothing to brag about.   Two of my friends and I arrived around 4p today and sat out in the patio. They didn't seem very busy but maybe the bartender was working the bar and tables. Service was extremely slow. We ran out of chips and salsa before our order was taken. The bartender did not refill the chips until our food came out and we actually had to ask for it. So you know how long that took.  Our drinks were empty for 15 mins before we were able to get the bartender's attention to ask for a second round. We weren't even given any water.   I wasn't very hungry and ordered and mini tacos from the appetizers. There was no description under this item. When I put in the order, I asked for the mini tacos with beef. The bartender confirmed and said \"shredded beef\". I said \"yes\". They brought out mini chimichangas. When we told the bartender, he said they didn't have mini tacos with beef, only mini tacos with bean. So when I asked for \"beef\", he just took it upon himself to put in the chimichangas. Who does that? Apparently, I should have been familiar with the kitchen and the menu. It did not occur to him to tell me, at the time he took my order, that they did not have mini tacos with shredded beef? Or even explain what came with the mini tacos since there was no description? There was nothing else on the menu that seemed appealing so I told the bartender to bring the chimis back.   Now, it had only been 2 mins from the time they brought out the chimis, took it back into the kitchen, and brought it back out to me. Yet, the chimis were already room temperature. Which probably meant they had already been sitting around before they were brought out the first time. Some of them were soggy at the bottom. I could not finish the plate.   When the bartender gave us the check, he charged us for the chimis. This seemed a bit unreasonable since it was his mistake to begin with. When we asked him to remove the chimi from the bill, he said \"you ate it\". I told him I didn't order it and it was his mistake (that I had to eat it). He snapped the check presenter from my hand. When he returned with the corrected check, he threw it down in the table.    Perhaps Frank and Lupe aren't concerned with hiring smart servers. Even the bus boy seemed smarter and more polite than the bartender.",

It was also my friend's bday and I asked them to bring a dessert at a certain time and they literally brought it out 20 minutes after I had to remind them again. When it came to the check we had issues trying to pay separately and had to get up and give the waiter our cards which we suggested..since he wanted us to put the bill on one card and told us that the computer doesn't print checks separately. And when I told him to swipe the card a certain way and charge two meals one check it's as if he wasn't listening because he kept saying how the \"cards didn't work\".

The one thing that really does it for me at Frank & Lupe's Old Mexico is the patio!  That is why I keep coming back.  I should also mention I think 'Frank and Lupe's' is a cool name and fun to say.  If you are in a hurry don't come here, but if you want to lounge on the patio and have a leisurely lunch with a margarita in Old Town, well then, Frank and Lupe's is your place!",

The atmosphere is of a charming old style Catina...nothing fancy but very relaxed feel. The four top signs of a good Mexican restaurant are... Salsa Chips Beans Rice....they all were great!!!! The plates we ordered had good flavor.  Love to be able to taste fresh spices, onion, and cilantro.   Our server was Michael and he was always there at the right time. It is the kind of place you do not want to be in a big rush to eat.  Sit back and relax on the patio!!!!  I would recommend.",

Like some other reviewers, one of the guests in our party found a dead ROACH in their drink that ruined our entire dinner. Since this doesn't seem to be a rare occurrence, I feel obligated to warn others and post this review.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the worse part. After telling our server that this was completely unacceptable, we waited another 15 minutes before the manager on duty would speak with us. I explained that we had to cut our dinner short and that we didn't feel comfortable paying for the meal.  If this happened at any other establishment, the meal would be comp'd. But, at Frank and Lupe's, service isn't exactly their main concern. The manager continued to insist that he couldn't give any further discount than 30%. I re-iterated that this was a matter of cleanliness and that our entire dinner was cut short as the rest of my party was completely disgusted and had lost their appetite.   The manager wouldn't budge and claimed the owner would fire him if he gave any further discount (?). Since we didn't seem to be making any progress, we begrudgingly paid the bill and left. I sincerely wanted to walk out of there and not pay anything.  I understand that things can happen but, management should have done the right thing. Not to mention, someone could get sick from the way this kitchen is kept. I will never, ever go back to this restaurant again. Absolutely disgusted...",

    "text": "I remember coming here a few years ago and really liking it, so when Deal Chicken had an offer for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks, I grabbed one. I finally went to use it yesterday and was pretty underwhelmed.  Things started off great. My boyfriend and I got there at around noon on Sunday, and since the place wasn't very crowded, we were allowed to pick where we wanted to sit. Our waiter promptly took our drink orders and brought us out chips and salsa. The chips were amazing! Probably some of the best I've had at a Mexican restaurant.   Since we had $30 to spend and weren't drinking, we opted to get an order of mini chimis to start. The meat inside the chimis was pretty good, but the chimi itself was disappointing. It didn't have that typical crisp that fried things should have, and it was actually kind of soggy.  For our entrees, I got the stuffed sopaipilla with carne adovada and red sauce, and my boyfriend had the smothered bean and cheese burrito with green sauce. The red sauce was good and super spicy, but the meat was pretty dry. I was thinking a \"smothered\" burrito would be covered in sauce, enchilada style, but instead it just had a spoonful of diced green chiles thrown on top. The burrito was okay, but the rice on both of our plates was pretty bland and some of it was still crunchy and undercooked.  Right after we got our entrees, the place got pretty crowded and our waiter seemed to forget about us. We wanted to get dessert, but it took so long for him to just come by and clear our plates that we opted to just get the check and go.  If I was in the neighborhood and was really craving Mexican food, I might stop by. But I definitely would not drive out of my way to come here.",

Chicken tacos had bland chicken and came on crunchy shells, which was unexpected.  Rice and beans that came with both meals were disgusting. Things that come out of a can tastes better.  Chips & salsa only free the first round. The chips were good, but salsa was probably one of the worst I've had at an \"authentic\" mexican restaurant, so i'm really not sure why they are so stingy with it.  Service: the place was full, but in the 15 minutes that we stood inside when NOBODY acknowledged us, 3 tables were cleared. Only when a family of 8 walked in and crowded the whole place and they were FORCED to talk to us did we get seated.   The waitress at the end also tried to overcharge us. I left her an awful tip. Here's another tip: make your food better, and have better service, and stop trying to rip off your patrons!",

We asked about happy hour specials, and we were told that margs were half price. Hooray! The bartender didn't mention that there was no happy hour that day, so we paid $13 for one marg made from the bottled green stuff branded Chi-chi's, I think. The younger bartender wandered away to ignore us at the register. The older one came to take our order; we ordered the mole chicken to split. $16 for half a chicken didn't seem to be outrageous to split. She walked away, leaving a menu. She did not acknowledge our order or ask any questions, just meandered off. My daughter wanted to order another drink, but could not get the attention of anyone behind the bar who were literally 2 feet away from us. The food took a while, but it was good. If you enjoy being treated rudely, I recommend you go to Frank and Lupe's immediately to get your share of abuse.",

Poblano cream chicken enchiladas were amazing. Had this fantastic green sauce on it.  And the Cadillac margarita had a great mixture.  Good flavor with the tequila he recommended.  Only downfall it was a bit overpriced.  However a very cool little atmosphere.  Def recommendation for this place.",

Waiter was never around to inquire after our order, nor offer chips for the overly long wait. When we finally got it it was thrown together like an afterthought and tasted mediocre at best. I tried to tell the waiter it wasn't what I ordered and he just kept saying \"yes, it's good, it's fine\". I ordered an enchilada and got an open-faced shredded taco with a sunny up egg on top, no enchilada sauce and no cheese. Then he insisted he gave 20% off due to its late arrival but it was just $5.00 off of $52.00. In what world is that 20%?! When I told him we were very dissatisfied he, again, said \"no, it's good, it's fine\", like he was telling us how we should feel about the whole experience, very dismissive. When we asked to speak with a manager he finally reduced the bill further, but even free isn't worth such a frustrating experience for mediocre food. AVOID AT ALL COST.",

I went in and asked a lady in front to be seated - she made me seat on a side not close to window and since the whole restaurant was almost empty I asked can I get seat close to window since there were a lot of them! She rudely said you can get either this or bar! I felt rude but took the seat! She comes after 2min and asked so ok I can make you sit on the seat near the window! Very very rude she was!   Then someone came to take my order! He was in Rush as if he has to catch a train! He took my order, never checked for any more salsa, or if food is ok or I need more water or any other drink!   In food I ordered veggie burrito rice and bean! It was very ok taste wise! The only thing I loved was salsa and chip! If I ever go back to this place just because of that! I am sure though there are other places to try in Scottsdale!",

The homemade chips and salsa are delicious and addictive...beware!

    "text": "We made the mistake of coming here AND bringing future in laws fresh off a long flight with us. We saw reviews and thought hey this place is good, close to the hotel, let's go seems OK and we are in Arizona why not get Mexican food. BOY WE'RE WE WRONG. It just went downhill so fast. The chips and salsa were the highlight of the meal. First, we got seated eventually (maybe 15 min of confusion) and then our order was taken. We proceed to wait like you do at a restaurant. About 30 minutes later I asked for more chips and salsa the waitress took the basket and never came back with more. We watched another larger group table get seated and order. We watched them get their food. It had been an hour and we didn't have chips and salsa OR our orders! We got up to talk to someone only to have them tell us to sit down everyone is waiting it's a first in first out system. BS if this were True we would have had our food because our order was in before the others had even arrived to the restaurant! They proceeded to argue with us ending with it's \"Mexican style\" and to not expect service like anywhere else. Bull. So then they say fine your food is ready we'll give you a discount for this. So they took 50% off the bill. Our total was $30 and it wasn't even worth that. My shrimp fajitas came out on a cast iron skillet which was lukewarm (clearly just sitting out for a long time) and the rice with cheese ontop was so cold the rice was clumped and so was the cheese.  I've never been the type to be so upset to leave a review, but this is by far the worst dinning experience I've ever had. No exaggeration.  I hope no customer deals with these problems again.   TLDR: I would never go here again and would NEVER recommend it. Service horrible, waited 1+hr for food, and it was cold.",

It's a little more spacious than the inside seating.   I've eaten here a few times with family and friends. The staff is attentive and accommodating. They serve chips and salsa for the table, the chips are great. The salsa is a little more blended than I'd prefer and not quite hot enough, but it's still good!   I've had their Chile relleno and their taco salad. Both were excellent and very rich in flavor. The food is reasonably priced for the area and the quality/quantity. I also tried their \"beerita\" which paired nicely with the meal.",

Took drink orders, got drinks in a reasonable time, waiter came back in a decent amount of time to take orders.  Food arrived and the waiter walked away - they didn't come back to ask if we needed anything or whatnot, still, they weren't that busy.  Our drinks were empty and we really would have liked some water or another drink but no dice.  We ordered the chicken poblano enchiladas... there were maybe 5  chunks of chicken in mine and the chicken was super chewy/lumpy, like over cooked shrimp consistency, essentially we got cheese enchiladas covered in sauce.  Some random person brought water when we were finishing our food, the waiter grabbed our plates and brought the check.

Food: I love the chips and salsa. The mole here is incredible!! The shrimp fajitas are good too, but inconsistent. And, I had a bite of my friends poblano cream chicken enchiladas -- the sauce was delicious but the chicken was bland. If you are looking for a good taco plate or enchilada with rice and beans...move along because the rest of the menu is bland-to-mediocre at very best. The last time I was there the beans were undercooked and the rice was flavorless. MOLE OR BUST! It might be the only thing worth coming for.   Summary: The mole alone would get 5 stars but I realize it's not for everyone. Thumbs down for the service and the remainder of the menu (for the most part).",

It took about ten minutes for someone to take our drink (which included an apology). I ordered the patron mojito because the menu specified fresh ingredients (agave nectar, lime, seltzer water), but as I watched him make it, it was mixed with a pre-mixed mojito blend. It tasted like a watered down margarita, but after I asked for soda water to be added, it tasted a little better. I wouldn't have ordered the drink had I known it would have been prepared that way so that was a bummer. We ordered the carnitas platter and blue corn tortilla tacos. The food came out quickly and tasted pretty good. Although, the carnitas platter came with flour tortillas. It bugs me when a restaurant assumes my tortilla choice. I thought it came with corn considering most restaurants in the area serve corn unless specified. I would have asked for corn as a replacement, but the staff was hustling for the rest of the restaurant and not really paying great attention to bar customers. We got our check and then they took my credit card and didn't give it back. After about ten mins, I had to ask for it. It was sitting in an open book in a pile of other empty ticket books. We will probably go back because the food was awesome. However, we will likely get it to go because quality of drinks and service left something to be desired. At least they were polite during the limited interactions!",

They had one server for THE WHOLE PATIO. We even had to ask for menus, waters, and chips since we weren't talked to until 20 mins after getting there. Half of the group didn't get their food and mine came out cold. The only thing that they did right was give me a birthday shot and I can't resist their Mole sauce (reason for the extra star). We were stuck there for over 3 1/2 hours due to the lack of good service. Go here if you have nothing else to do during the night since the servers do not care about you or your time at all.",

For lunch, I ordered the chicken flautas lunch with rice and beans. It was very flavorful with a kick. I had no idea it was going to be spicy at all, but I like spice, so it was fine with me!   For dessert, we decided on the sopapillas which were served with honey. The sopapillas were light and fluffy and not at all greasy. Add some honey, and it was a perfect ending to a good Mexican lunch.",

Food was great, the three Mexican food enthusiasts ordered various enchilada, I orders beef fajitas. Wonderful wonderful. They had no food left on their plates, I ate almost all of mine too (size is really more than I could stuff in). We walked away happily full. And the three are already planning on the next trip's coming back to this place. And I was super happy this wonderful meal did not give me tummy aches at all. Yum!",

We grabbed a drink at the bar but were disappointed that they didn't have any Negra Modelo on hand. The staff was friendly, but didn't see very organized or informed. The host kept telling us that he just put people at tables. After a bit of a wait, we were given a table. After a few minutes, the host requested that we re-position our table to accommodate a group of 17. We then watched as they went through heroic efforts to move tables and change all the chairs. After awhile this plan was abandoned and the party was moved to another room. In the meantime, we read the menu and noticed they didn't have steaks. Steaks were clearly mentioned on their website. At this point we just gave up. We finally had a table and didn't want to go somewhere else and start over again. This was the only dinner we were having in Scottsdale. We ordered a chicken soup and steak fajitas. Both were delicious, especially the soup which came in a generous bowl and was large enough to consider it a meal. The fajitas were good, but no substitute for what we had been craving.",

The night was cool, but not cold, perfect for enjoying some food and spirits.  The bartender, Julie I think, was very attentive.  Chip and salsa appeared out of no where and were good.  A large margarita was a bit on the sweeter side, but still very tasty.  I ordered a chicken burrito, a la carte (like the previous night) and it was good....but I did need to ask for some sour cream and guacamole.    It was a quiet night, so I had some good bartender conversation and actually met the owners son who was very night as well.  I definitely recommend.",

    "text": "This was my first time coming to Frank and Lupe's.  We were a part of a big birthday party about 15 of us.  We sat on the patio, it was a beautiful night to do so.  The menu was huge. I had the chicken chimi (ever known me to turn down a chimi?) which was huge had to take the leftovers home.  I wish I had room left to get my favorite dessert, sopapillas!  Someone at our table ordered it, it looked great.  I thought the food was good, reasonably priced and thought the margaritas were great.  The parking is horrible for going on a Friday or Saturday, wish the parking lot was for F & L customers only. I had to drive around and found one parking space over by Herb Box, that's too far away. Fortunately, a friend called me and said there was one space open.  I would not recommend going to this place with a big party.  About 4 of the people in our party didn't get their food.  They got their drinks and I thought the server should have given them something to eat to soak up all the drinks they had.  Not sure if they had drinks before but they seemed like they had been over served.  I would go back but not with a big group.",

This is where I stop.  Open face cheese enchiladas came with eggs, and a variety of sides.  Have you ever heard a song that gave you the shivers? It was kind of like that. I took one bit of my concoction (I put the egg wrapped in the enchilada, beans, rice, salsa, sour cream?)  And my mind exploded. It was the MOST heavenly thing I have EVER tasted.  Ever. However, I have not gone back and ordered it again becuase.. I dont want to ruin the memory. Of this perfect moment in culinary heaven. I dont want to over-eat it. It was... so.. delicious. And I had their sopapillas which come with meals with some beans and cheese in it after, which was a fine closure to the worlds perfect meal.  Service is always slow here, just like in Mexico ;D but all of the food is fresh and worth the wait. Chips and salsa are 'alright'.",

Walked into this place and it was quite busy, was actually quite surprised on how busy it was for 7pm on a Weds night. Lots of College football fans in their gear due to the game between the ducks and Auburn the day before, so I am assuming most of them were tourist.  There was no hostess, and after looking around I decided to mosey up to an empty stool at the bar, took the bartender/waiter a minute to see me, but once he did he was on top of things.   Got a Corona and my chip and salsa on, not a big fan of the authentic chips, and the salsa was a bit watery, I got an extra side of sour cream and guacamole, the guacamole was good, large chunks of avocado in it. Sour cream was your run of the mill, after looking over the unimpressive and hard to read lettering on the menu...due to poor design.  I decided after the chips maybe just to stick with what I had, so I got the nacho supreme with chicken. To say the least I was not impresses with any part of this dish except for the fact that it was huge...and the chicken was good...but there was not enough of it.   Total tab came to almost $25.00 for one beer and nacho supreme and a little extra sour cream and guacamole...RIP OFF!!!  Could of got better nacho's at Filberto's in Phoenix for way cheaper.  I would be willing to give this place another shot but to say the least I was not very impressed with it on this visit due to the lackluster food and high prices!",

Frank and Lupe's has been serving up some of the best Mexican food in a town overflowing with Mexican restaurants for over 25 years now. Located on the corner of Marshall Way and Indian School, Frank and Lupe's features authentic Mexican dishes such as Carne Adobada, Shrimp Enchiladas or Chili Relleno.  But the real treat awaits out back.  For those of you who know about the back patio (or discovered it on accident while searching for the bathrooms) we don't need to say anything else. For the rest of you, skip the small restaurant up front and head in back for one of the best outdoor experiences around.  I love to grab the Chicken Mole Enchiladas (fabulous) with a ginormous  (yes it is in the Webster dictionary now) margarita on the rocks and enjoy the great weather Scottsdale has to offer. The back patio is hidden from the traffic and pedestrians of Marshall way and offers a south of the border feeling when you want a little retreat.  What better place to enjoy a time out!  Need a real treat? Skip the Sopaipillas and try a Xango. What is a Xango you ask? A deep fried cheesecake rolled in a flour tortilla!",

I had to ask for tortillas, that should come with fajitas, and they took another 10 minutes to arrive.  By the time the tortillas arrived, my food was cold.  Then getting my bill proved just as great of a challenge and after waiting another 30 minutes I had to go to the bar to pay my restaurant bill.  Total time at the restaurant?  Right around 3 hours.

My measure of a mex place is can they make a good Releno- and these guys get it done.  Have you ever noticed- everything is better sitting at the bar and conversing with the people cooking and waiting on you??  They tend to take better care with you.",

The food and ambience, a series of indoor and outdoor patio rooms, are quaint and very satisfying, with good size portions, and a very friendly staff. At least to me they are. I was last there in late November and had the days special, enchiladas in a poblano sauce which was quite good. The salsa is spiced just right.",

    "text": "Gorgeous day on Monday and nothing cures my hangover like Mexican beer. Husband and I headed over to Frank and Lupe's to sit on the patio and enjoy the sun. Their complimentary chips are delicious and they don't give too large a portion, so as to avoid not having room for the main dish. Little bit of a pet peeve is having chips down before the water, but drinks were quickly delivered following the drop. The waitress was terribly slow, but it was obvious she was busy and not neglectful. It did not affect service. Why? Sometime you realize the True hero of restaurants is the back server (aka the busboy). The back server took our drink orders and made sure we were o.k. whenever the waitress was not around (which was pretty often).  I ordered the fish tacos and husband ordered the chimichanga. He was a huge fan of the meat, believing it to be of a higher quality than others he had at Mexican food restaurants. My fish tacos were delicious and gone in about two minutes. It was good to be reminded that this gem is close to home and should be added to the dining out rotation.",

Unfortunately we had to wait 40 mnutes for our food to arrive, which was as a complete mystery since the place wasn't packed and during that time we barely had a visit from our waitress.  The chips and salsa were good, the sopaipillas with honey are absolutely delicious.  I had the chicken taquitos which were fine, a little dried out but fine.  My buddy had Lupe's Enchiladas and he says they were fine but he's had better.  The service is what really ruined it for us.  I imagine others could have a different experience, but when you see waitresses outside on their cell phones you can understand they may have other priorities than waiting on your table.",

I was literally on my way! The restaurant didn't care - they have a policy that refuses to seat incomplete parties. On a subsequent visit, I realized why (and I definitely don't hold a grudge about my first experience). This place is popular, and always seems to have a long waiting list. I'd be upset if they sat incomplete parties in front of me too. I can't be a hypocrite! Pitchers of margaritas, average chips/salsa, and impressive dinner combination platters. I've only sat on the patio, and I never intend to sit inside. One of the main reasons I enjoy F&L's is the atmosphere of that patio. It truly is secluded and you can easily forget you are in Scottsdale. If you are a fan of Mexican food/atmosphere, you'll love this spot. Skip the chains like Macayo's - and head straight to Frank & Lupe's... Just make sure you have a complete party!",

You have a busy restauarant, if you do not have the kitchen capacity, do something about it, when you have a family with a baby, I would have preferred you told me to leave rather than seating me and making us wait for an hour for our food. And when it arrives you mess up the order and tell us that we can either eat what you put in front of us or wait another 20 minutes for the food we ordered.  And to top it off the food was cold, meat overcooked...absolute garbage. Is there any management on staff?  I never saw one and if there are they don't give a crap about their customers.",

This visit I would've given 4 stars given the service, food and overall vibe of the place.  During my second visit, the service was absolutely awful. Our server was rude, hardly came to our table and it seemed like we were burdening him with our presence. It didn't help matters that our host put us at a table for 2 people when we had 3 people in our party, so our table was not adequately sized to have our entrees on it. This visit I chalked up as an anomaly.  My third visit, again with a party of 3, we sat on the patio. There were three servers on the patio and 2 parties totaling 5 people. Our server is candidate for one of the worst servers I've ever had. She was rude, again we felt like a burden to her and she spent more time flirting with her colleague than actually coming to our table. A meal that should've taken 35 minutes took 75 minutes. Getting our check was even painstaking.  Needless to say that based on 2 out of 3 of my visits to Frank & Lupe's I give up on it. The food is okay but not worth the price of admission and the lackluster service that seems to be commonplace.",

Walked around the back to the patio and the waitress seated us right away.   She took our drink orders quickly and asked if we were ready to order. I asked for the two taco plate, shredded beef. She told me they don't have shredded beef. I pointed it out on the menu that it says they do and she explained that they just didn't have any today. I understood and asked if she would come back so i could rethink my dish.  A few minutes later she returned, my husband ordered enchiladas with mole and I ordered the corn tamales and asked for a side of sour cream, she told me they don't have sour cream. That kind of ended it for me there, because I hate going out to eat where they don't have anything you ask for, but we stuck it out. It didn't take long for our food to arrive, rice and beans aren't anything special, but the corn tamales were delicious and i tried my husbands enchiladas and chicken mole and that was amazing.  I guess I can say we probably won't seek out this place to eat here again when we come back to Scottsdale, but I do know where I can get some good corn tamales and chicken mole.",

Rumor has it the original restaurant is located in Socorro, NM. It doesn't get any more authentic than this - including Hatch chilies and incredible salsa.  Yes, the cuisine is definitely \"warm to hot\" and spicy,  so if you can't take the heat, you can always fall back to \"gringo\" food.  I highly recommend the flat red enchiladas or the carne avocado.  Frank and Lupe's is an incredible gastronomic oasis in a vast desert of mediocre wanna-be Taco Bell look-a-like Mexican restaurant's.",

I ordered my typical combo plate and everything was greasy and didn't have that fresh, perfectly spiced taste I came to love.  I am not sure if it is under new ownership, but something has changed drastically to the quality of the food.  I will say the chips and salsa were very good.  So, if your going in for a margarita or beer, get the chips and salsa to go with!

The owner was quite personable on the way out, and the vibe of the place is quite cool.  The food was just meh. We had a taco platter and Guadalajara tacos...wasn't anything great. A good thing was that they were not greasy, and the rice and beans were very good. Otherwise, nothing to shout about. So many other amazing places in the area, go find them.",

    "text": "Let me start this review by saying I think this is one of the best mexican restaurants in Scottsdale, but my review is based on one particularly poor experience. I am hoping the owner/manager will read this and do something about it because I really love this place and want to come back!  So here it is - we went here last night as my roommates mom was in town and really wanted mexican food. We got there and were told it would be a 30 minute wait and to have a seat at the bar outside and we could get a drink while we waited. We proceeded to wait a full hour without hearing anything about our table, or being even given the slightest amount of attention at the bar to order a drink. Meanwhile the place is a mess. there was a table right up front that could have fit us all but hadn't been bussed in a long time, a waiter just spilled an entire plate of food on someone's lap - I'm not sure what was going on, but it seemed like the staff were falling apart, we considered leaving but since we've had such great experiences here before, we wanted to stick it out.  We finally got seated after our long wait and had to wait another full 10 minutes to be given waters. We ordered drinks (which she got our order wrong and forgot one drink) and waited another 15 minutes to get them. For one drink, the waitress didn't know the difference between anejo and respesado tequila, and ended up bringing the complete wrong thing. We again considered just having the drinks and leaving but stayed. At this point, someone at the table saw our waitress take a shot behind the bar while we were anxiously waiting on chips & salsa and for our order to be taken.  Fast forward to when our food came - the food has been amazing in the past and I was super excited. Unfortunately this too was a huge letdown. It was clear that all our orders have been sitting out for some time and were crusty on top. The melted cheese had solidified and was cold. My crunchy taco was now a soft taco (which I sent back). The food was poor quality and a huge letdown.  What I've loved about this place in the past is that if you sit on the patio outside, the atmosphere, food and drinks make you feel like you're transported to Mexico.... but during this visit, we could have felt more like were in Mexico if we went to Taco Bell (which we also considered as an alternative and should have gone instead).  Not sure what is going on, but this place seems to be going downhill fast. I really hope some changes are made.",

No we were hungry and figured we'd wait any restaurant had we left. Waited another 20 minutes for drink order... Over an hour later food arrives,cold small not very appetizing portions. Had to ask several times for items- drinks, silverware, check... You name it, we had to do their job. Plus my husband got sick a few days after eating. It appeared to be food poisoning to me. Just gross all together. I'd avoid this place at all costs!",

Nestled away off Scottsdale blvd so it may be hard to find and is not one of those restaurants you end up walking by as a snowbird tourist.  However, this restaurant, unlike many others in old town Scottsdale, has survived from being torn down, remodeled and renamed something else (like so many others).    The food is what you would expect from a traditional American style restaurant.  This time I had the 3 cheese enchiladas with red sauce that comes with rice and beans. Now, you know your at an old school Mexican restaurant when they offer 10 different varieties of this dish!  Personally, this is what I like.  If you would rather have different varieties of tacos and salads and think you are at a Mexican restaurant then there are others close by.  Just don't expect those other restaurants to be around the next time you come back.",

    "text": "I don't see how this place was so busy.  The seating arrangement is strange, the service is bad, and the food is terrible!  I came with my husband and 2 year old son.  There is seating in the front of the restaurant where it was hot and humid, and there was seating in the patio.  We decided to sit in the patio are where we were seated by a lady who looked like she hated her job. She seated us, and didn't bring a child's seat for my son.  So, I went to ask her for one.  She rudely told me to give her a minute.  Any time we needed anything, we had to come up to her.  Our visit was nearly 2 hours and she probably checked on us two maybe three times the entire time.  I understand she has a job to do, but being disgruntled with paying customers is inexcusable.   We ordered our food, which took quite a while to come out, and when it finally did, my food was wrong.  I sent it back.  By the time the right food came out, my son and husband had already almost finished their meal.  I didn't want them to wait on me to eat because who knew how long it was going to take for the food to come out again.  We ordered chile rellenos, mini tacos, and carnitas  enchiladas with green sauce.  This place claims to be like \"Old Mexico\", and the food was by far the furthest from authentic Mexican food. The mini tacos were some frozen store bought \"Jose Ole\" mini tacos that were fried and served with guac and salsa.  The chile rellenos were made with CHEDDAR cheese.  That is NOT the way we know them to be made.  And the enchiladas were salty beyond belief, and the just plopped the carnitas on top of a cheese enchilada with the weirdest tasting green sauce ever.  They're stingy with their chips while you wait, and super skimp with their sides.  My husband didn't even get nearly a quarter cup of sides.   This place is ridiculous, and is nothing like \"Old Mexico\", or authentic in anyway.  My husband is Mexican and I have had my fair share of authentic Mexican food, and this place definitely DOES NOT have it.",

It's unfortunate as it's a great looking funky place and would have been some place to return too.  Unfortunately that won't happen.  The waitress was pleasant and tried to be accommodating to my mother as all of the sauces were much to hot for her, but she needed something a bit more mild.  My husband ordered the mini taco's.  They must have sat under the heat too long as the beef inside  was a hard chunk of something? and the shells were dry and overdone.  They were a very deep golden color.  I ordered the Chimichunga (chicken),  it was 90 % pico inside with less than 3/4 c of bland white meat of chicken.   I opened it up and just ate the chicken. on a positive note...the chips were good.......",

We were told we had to purchase those separately. Yet if you sit down in the restaurant and order the exact same food at the exact same price chips are included. Why is that? I really don't get it.

I hosted a meal for over 30 people there and my guests had a blast.  The not so good (Worth 2 starts): * Yes, the service is pretty awful.   You almost always have to wait and wait for anything you need....whether its a refill on a drink, or more chips and salsa you are left wondering how no one seems to notice or care. * The patio is crowded and the bar is tiny (maybe 4 seats?)  If you do go, there is a limited window of time to enjoy.   Due to the heat, this is primarily an October through April opportunity for lunch....and maybe through May for dinner.

I don't want to disparage a local business but after the experience with the margarita and my time in the emergency room, I can say I will never go back.

    "text": "This place was just ok.  My boyfriend loves their chicken enchiladas.  We were with a party of five and were given our choice of seating when we walked in.  However, I should have known that I wasn't in store for a 5 star experience when the server who was \"seating\" us just walked away when we chose the table we wanted.  I was left standing there wondering if he was going to go get menus and then seat us or if we were supposed to just go sit down.  Kind of awkward.    Food was also just average.  The bf still enjoyed his chicken enchiladas.  I should also add that he initially ordered the wrong enchilada plate and when it came to the table the server was very accommodating about taking it back and getting the correct entree.  I had the carnitas taco special which was two tacos with rice and beans.  I specifically asked about what kind of tortillas the tacos were made with and the server said they were hard shell tacos.  When they arrived the tortillas were corn, greasy and soft.  Not so good.  My mom's soft tacos were strangely served upside down.  I was also the only at the table who was served refried rather than whole beans.  Not sure if that was part of the special, but thought it was kind of strange.    I loved that they served sopapillas with dinner.  Prices are reasonable and service was fair.  It was an ok experience but with other better places I don't know that I would choose to go back.",

    "text": "The only thing that must keep this place alive is a great outdoor patio and good location. The service is awful, as in it's painfully obvious the management has no commitment to serving the customer. Sat down on a less than busy Sunday evening, and waited 15 minutes before drink orders were taken. After emptying the first glass the food arrived, and the drinks were not refilled until 3/4 of the way through the meal. What server doesn't check in on drinks, especially when the food arrives? I also had to go to the bar to get my silverware. The food is at the lower end of the spectrum on quality, considering the multitude of options.    I was angry when I paid the bill, and wish I had picked someplace else. With a lot of options, this place is a no go. Take Filberto's to the park, and the squirrels will likely service you better. Win -win.   Plus, don't order an extra basket of chips, that will cost you. WTF.",

So, sit back and enjoy your drink and the chips and salsa.  2) Special orders are happily accommodated. I wanted the the rolled enchiladas but with veggies instead of the other options (beef, chicken or spinach). The waiter (actually the manager since our waiter was busy) happily accommodated my order as well as giving me the option to have either or both of the green and red sauce (the red is better).  3) Huge portions. Yes, I'm small but I have a big appetite. Lunch at F&L's held me over until 8 p.m.!  4) Warm sopapillas. Warm, deep-fried bready goodness with lots of honey. What more could you want?  5) Location. Nestled in the midst of galleries, boutiques and other retail stores. I'd suggest starting your day at F&Ls so you are ready to spend the rest of your day in the surrounding area, only to break for the 5 p.m. martini.",

On the other hand - there was today.  - No server for about 15 minutes  - No chips and salsa 'til we asked (then they took forever to bring the chips)   - Ordered drinks that never arrived  - Ordered guacamole that never arrived  - Waiter was retarded and sucky, possibly just a random man who walked in and pretended to be a waiter as we would ask him for stuff and he would never deliver  - Random waitress stops by to find out if we ordered yet. We tell her \"no.\" So she takes our order.  - While you are at it , sister: Where is our soda and chips and gauc??? She looks horrified and brings them promptly. Thank you waitress lady and no thank you to you sh*tty waiter #1  - Food takes billions of years. Possibly trillions.  - We ask where food is at, yo.   - They find our food.  - It's a little dry (like, no sauce on the enchilada's bro)  - But otherwise food is good  But wait... there's more...   - Where are our utensils???  - Waiter says we can have forks, but no knives. The knives are being washed right now.  ???  - With one bite left, waiter brings newly washed knives  - Ice cream please  - Fried ice cream good   So...today was notsogood for Frank & Lupe's. Normally this place is much better. I think this is a 4 star place that has a 1 star day. I'll be back soon hoping for a better day.",

I love the decor and the ambiance of this place! Everything from the lighting to the music to everything was wonderful! For the first time in awhile I felt like this was truly an authentic restaurant (rare in the concrete jungle!). I like the little quirks of having to go outside to the restroom, and the cool back patio.   This place came highly recommended by the other couple we went with and to be honest, we had such a damn good time with them that I hardly remember the food (which does not say much for the food since I just ate dinner there last night!). The chips and salsa were great but not amazing. The salsa was definitely fresh but a little too thin for me. To drink, I had a prickly pear Margarita which was wonderful! I was not all that impressed with my meal. No doubt it was authentic but I didn't really care for all the extra grease.   As everyone said, the service is SUPER slow but we didn't really mind since we had great drinks but based on the food/service, I doubt we will return....",

The room that extends off of the main entrance can get pretty hot so make sure you check where the sun is setting before you agree to your seating arrangement.  The back patio is wonderful, especially in the cooler times.  The bathrooms are in the back patio so if you are seated in the restaurant you have to find your way to the bathrooms in the back.

    "text": "Frank & Lupe's is like the melding of two worlds. Good ol' America and Mexico, you're thinking, huh? Not exactly. I'm talking about one world with good service and another world with not-so-good service. Which world you land in, and, thus, the type of service you receive depends solely on you.  I've been to Frank & Lupe's maybe four or five times. Once was a visit to the Santos Lounge portion of the property. You can read up on that venture on your own. All other times, except once, I've been drawn to the backyard patio. This is Scottsdale, after all, and great weather demands that we remain outdoors to celebrate it. The problem is that the patio is found in the world of not-so-good service.  Frank & Lupe's tends to draw large groups. Many times, those groups are made up of tourists. Being tourists, they usually want to sit outside because they are from far off places where \"outside\" is no farther away than the garage. That's okay. But be prepared for a bit of a wait while said tourists stretch out and make this place their own. You should also be prepared for the somewhat frenetic pace that comes when servers wait on large groups --- especially large groups of tourists. It can be dizzying. Or, maybe it was the hunger that was making me dizzy.  Servers will come and go. They'll go to other tables. They will eventually come to your table and take your order. It is done with a smile and friendly feel. But then they will go to other tables and leave you with an empty glass and a mouth dry from the basket of chips you gorged on. A possible solution might be to order one of those beer buckets. Another solution is to snag a table inside where the world of good service is to be found.  After always venturing to the patio and always receiving sub-par service, I figured it was time to try inside. What a difference it made. We were seated and waited on immediately and proceeded to get the greatest service I had ever had at Frank & Lupe's. I never got his name, but I think he works behind the bar sometimes. So efficient was the service that we were wiping our mouths and settling the tab before we even made a dent in the night. A stroll through the galleries during Art Walk helped take care of that, though.  The bottom line here is that the food is pretty good and the service is great ... or not so great, depending on your chosen world.",

This place fits in well. Cute look inside and out.  Server sat me right away. I hardly looked at the menu before deciding on the Special, shredded beef tacos and a Corona. Chips and salsa were so-so. The tacos were delicious. Came with some rice and lettuce. Very simple, and exactly what I wanted. The added bonus is the tacos had a good spice to them, and the tortillas were tasty.  Before I could ask for dessert they brought me the check. The real reason I was there was because I saw they had sopaipillas. I asked my server to add an order (2) of sopaipillas, which she gave to me gratis. I know better than to expect great sopaipillas outside of New Mexico, and these were just ok. Still a novelty to get them somewhere without having to travel to NM.",

    "text": "The not-so-cost-conscious bartender was pouring the Cadillac Margaritas tall and strong when I swaggered on to the patio at Frank & Lupe's the other night. It was over 100 degrees outside and the icy concoctions went down nicely. I'll claim it as a medicinal endeavor since I've been told by a Puerto Rican friend that alcohol helps to regulate internal body temperature. I'm no doctor, so I was happy to give it every chance to work its magic.   The patio was packed when we arrived, but as we polished off our first pitcher of Negro Modelo we were seated. The wait staff here are deft at flipping tables on busy nights, though you never feel rushed. Chips and salsa arrived quickly. Hot, fresh chips and the spicy, cilantro-y salsa that I've come to love about this place. Now, down to the business of ordering.   There were four of us, so ample opportunity to sample a good portion of the menu. Stacked enchiladas with red sauce and a fried egg on top; carne adovada plate with rice, beans and tortillas; chili relleno that melts in your mouth as well as the ever popular chicken mole (that's 'moe-lay', of course). Served quick and not unlike a mosh-pit on a plate. It's unfussy and a little bit messy. It's how my Mexican food ought to be.   For dessert (as if anyone needs to chase this kind of dinner with anything more), there were fresh-from-the-fryer sopapillas with honey. Tender and flaky at the same time. It's the reason I wanted a siesta before continuing out the door to our next destination.   Don't head to Frank & Lupe's for some pansy-ass health-conscious salad or a pretentiously perfect \"ameri-mex\" experience. You'll be doing yourself a disservice. Instead, prepare yourself for a full on, chili-laden assault to the senses. You won't be disappointed.",

Then 15 minutes to get us menus, water, and chips. Wanted to take our order about a minute after delivering our menus. Then, almost 40 minutes to get the food out. The bartender wasn't our waiter, but he was stuck delivering water, chips, and our food. Needless to say, we didn't get refills on much of anything during the 40 minute wait for our food. Would have complained to the manager, but couldn't figure out who to ask, or if it would have done any good.   Let me repeat, the food was spectacularly good. And, had I been with a group of drinking friends, the wait would have been tolerable. But, I was with my children on a school night.    The icing on the cake of craptastic service was the 15 minutes we had to wait to get our bill. I'm not sure they would have actually noticed if we had left without paying, they were that disorganized. As good as the food was, I'm hard pressed to find a reason to return anytime soon.

So anyway I wasn't super duper hungry but the veggie burrito cost almost as much as the enchiladas del mar, and i haven't had seafood in a while so i thought, \"well, okay $9.25 enchiladas here I come.\" supposedly the meal was 3 enchiladas with crab and shrimp, rice and beans...and it included 2 sopapillas for dessert, which i don't like and didn't want, but you don't pay less for not having them, and they brought them anyway.  I had scoped out two guys across the way with really huge plates full of food, and thought at least if i was getting all that food i could take some home. That's why i was surprised when my plate was set down in front of me. I had three tiny cheese enchiladas that were not stuffed with crab and shrimp, but were topped with a few of those freaky teeny tiny shrimp and FAKE CRAB. those horrible whitefish composite crab legs that taste equally of tuna, eggs and white bread. I was stunned. Frank and Lupe's should be ASHAMED of themselves for serving this to paying customers for nine dollars.   How about the rest of the dish? Well, there was about 1 tablespoon of crusty rice (how rice can get crusty i don't even want to know) and an equal amount of beans that had no taste. not even bean taste. To add insult to injury the whole meal was swimming. a 1/4 in lake of oil-speckled water coated the bottom of the plate and i really can't even imagine why.   None of the food was hot and only when the \"seafood\" was pushed off my enchiladas was i able to choke them down. I know i should have sent this back and walk out. I know it. but I was so embarrassed, i could not believe that this was a meal I would end up paying $12 dollars for (including tip) and I just wanted to cry, scream, but mostly, get the hell out of there.   What a travesty to the name of Mexican food.",

There's nothing like hanging out on a patio in 80 degree weather after a spring training game getting refreshed from one of the best margaritas in Scottsdale...nothing.    Everything aside, the margaritas were freaking awesome.  My buddy Chris R and I conducted a skateboard margarita tour of Scottsdale one Saturday, and I've gotta say that Frank and Lupe's were definitely near the top.  Their patio is to die for.  I would rather wait for an outdoor table for an hour than be immediately seated inside.    The food - as a previous reviewer said it's on par with similar \"gringo\" Mexican places; not bad but not what you target on a quest for authentic.  The service has been slow at times, but for the most part I've never had any issue.  I look forward to every opportunity to return to this refreshing break from the Scottsdale norm!!",

    "text": "If you're looking for an upscale, service-oriented place, don't bother.  This isn't it.  If you're looking for generic Sonoran style Mexican (think Valle Luna, Garcia's, etc.), don't bother.  This is not the place to get a chimichanga.  If you want a solid margita and rediculous flat enchilada finished off with simple sopapillas & honey, this may be the best place on earth.  I've been frequenting Frank & Lupe's for over 7 years now.  I can definitely tell that the place is a proverbial \"hole-in-the-wall\".  It's like a converted house with uncomfortable chairs and terrible accoustics that magnify everyone's voices.  The bar area is a nice outdoor setup, but is basically in an alley with wrought iron furniture that leaves grate marks on your legs.  The service is generally pleasant and efficient, but can be a bit variable.  The food, outside of the specialities, isn't anything to write home about.  So, why the high rating?  #5 and #6.  You can't go wrong with the #5 or #6 (variations on the New Mexican style flat enchilada) served with green or red chile (heat seems to vary with season), chicken/beef, and a fried egg on top (get it over easy).  Though not wonderfully hot like Los Dos Molinos, there's something about the enchiladas here.  I can't explain it.  They're just plain good... in a manner than appeals to something ancient in humans.  The post-#5 satisfaction is about as pleasing as it gets outside the bedroom.  To boot, the margaritas are pretty decent (and cheap) and the sopapillas are warm and just the right combination of soft and chewy.  They are just good wiping up the mix of chile, cheese, and beans on the plate as they are with a generous drip of honey.  Finally, there's a relaxed feeling (some might find it just plain lax) that is a wonderful contrast to it's surroundings (located right in the middle of Old Town Snottsdale).  Duck into Frank & Lupe's for an hour and escape the self-absorbed pretentiousness oozing from nearby Fashion Square and countless short-lived, trendy (but admittedly tasty) restaurants concepts all up and down Scottsdale Road.",

I had the combo platter, since I wasn't sure what to have.  The pork tamales was too thick and dried.  I make better tamales myself.  The cheese enchilada was a joke.  They were skimpy on the cheese both inside and outside the enchilda.  No taste/flavor at all.  The beef taco was a surprise.  I found myself savoring every bite of it.  The rice...so-so.  The waiters were attentive.  They did their best handing 20 of us.  Not an easy job but they made it!  So, they alone deserve a star.  Nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.",

    "text": "I am a native Arizonan who was raised suckling red chiles and gumming machaca beef. I dated a native New Mexican for four years who thought green chile was the be-all-end-all of seasonings, and considered it blasphemy that sopapillas were served as dessert instead of with the entree. Now I'm seeing Mr. Man, a real Mexican that just giggles at our silly bastardized food in comparison to his mother's authentic flavor. That said, I consider myself pretty well versed in the differences between these distinct styles of cuisine, and Frank and Lupe's was a straight up New Mexican diner.   Mr. Man and I met his mother at Frank & Lupe's for a Labor Day lunch after driving around and finding that all our other dining choices were either closed or packed. And it turned out to be some pretty respectable eats for a a cute little hole in the wall.  The service was kind of slow despite the fact that it wasn't very crowded, but the staff was friendly and very quick to recommend their personal favorites off the menu. With that combination met, I didn't really mind the wait. A meal out on the town is something to be savored and enjoyed in the company of others, and that's just what we did with the extra time. Well, that and nurse Patron margaritas that whooped the shit out of any and all in recent memory.   When it comes to the entrees, I second what Ken H. has to say. With New Mexican food you can never, ever go wrong with the green and red chile. Don't go there and get something Americanized, like a chimichanga or a steak. And if your eyes start to cross once you see just how many possibilities there are, go for the carne adovada. I was obliged to order it just so I could compare it to other establishments' offerings and measure it against my own version of succulent, melt-in-your-mouth, garlicky red chile pork. Not as good as my own (naturally I like mine best), but it was pretty tasty when wrapped in a pillow of sopapilla and brought a smile to my face.  Mr. Man got Lupe's Enchilada plate with shredded beef and it was probably the best thing ordered at our table. Three corn tortillas layered with cheese and beef and topped with an egg over medium may sound a bit weird, but the flavor will make you groan with delight. Try it. It'll rock your wildest expectations.   I only have one gripe and that has to do with the filler served at all Mexican food restaurants, chips and salsa. They were made from thick, substantial tortillas instead of those flimsy lil offerings at other joints, but all they managed to do was be a flavorless receptacle for an equally bland salsa. It was heavy on black pepper and completely blended, so aside from a couple of scallions floating around, it was texture free, runny blech. No me gusta nada.",

The staff very friendly and accommodating and attentive. Incredible little place. Do not miss out.",

The decor and ambiance are nice, the temperature was much too warm with what felt like no AC, just a small electric vertical fan.  The service was mediocre .  Took a long time for drink refills or needed to ask more than once.  Of our party they forgot to take the order for two people .    Chips tasted stale and like old oil, salsa was ok . The nachos were sent back due to flavor of oil and ordered something different .",

They offer us the smallest of the available tables my husband requests a table that is in a less crowded part of the room and is told by Juan(don't know if that's his name but I am guessing ...could also be Pablo or Jose)no, we can't be seated there because they might get busy. Keep in mind it's 8 pm on a Tuesday night. GREAT customer service buddy way to make your customers feel valued.  I could tell my husband was offended that they would deny us a table because of other customers that \"might\" come in.  I suggested we go somewhere else instead of sticking around to be served by people that managed to offend us before we even sat down... so we decided to leave. Because of the rude unprofessional manner this staff behaved we did not get to try this restaurants food nor will we be back to be treated like this again. To the Owners of Frank and Lupe's you  are losing money because your servers are rude. As I said before we will not be back but maybe you can stop your staff from chasing away future customers and lowering your revenue",

We initially to the back patio to grab a table because the inside is very small and there weren't a lot of open tables. Chips and salsa were very good. Waiter got us our drinks and then he never came over again. We even asked another server if we could order our food because we had been waiting so long but we didn't get assistance.  Not ready to give up just yet, we decided to go inside and see if we could get better service. It was less crowded now so we were able to grab the only clean table. (There was one waitress serving all the tables - on a Saturday during prime dinner time). I ordered the chicken fajita plate. There were no peppers! In fajitas! Chicken was chewy and didn't have much flavor.   I could get better fajitas at Chilis. How sad!   My boyfriend ordered the shrimp enchiladas, but our server let us know 10 minutes after ordering that they ran out of shrimp.  My boyfriend ordered the veggie burrito, which was supposed to come smothered in their home-made red sauce. It wasn't. My boyfriend said it was very bland, and we were overcharged for our food. His burrito was (supposed to be) $10 and my fajita plate was $13.  Overall I am very disappointed because this place had such potential, but the service and food just failed so miserably. I almost tried to convince myself that maybe they had an off day, but it was seriously a Saturday night during prime dinner time and there's really no excuse for this bad of an experience. Will not be going back.",

I thought I'd play it safe with the grilled chicken and vegetables but the chicken was dried out, chewy and bland, luckily the vegetables weren't bad. My husband ordered ground beef tacos and he found them to be inedible due to a funky taste. So he switched to a quesadilla which he managed to eat some of but said the cheese tasted odd on left a greasy film on the roof of his mouth. The service isn't great either.  My husband asked for a spicier salsa 4 times before they even brought it out and it was tasteless and watered down as was the regular salsa, even the chips were tasteless, bland. The guacamole tasted like the powdered instant kind.  My husband loves good tequila and checked out what they had and reported back that they only had bottom self alcohol. They do have a fun outdoor dining patio. It certainly isn't worth eating here considering the quality of food and cost. There are far too many better  Mexican restaurants in the area .",

    "text": "So, I struggled with how to handle my emotions and how to best communicate my experience.  Let's begin with the positives.  It was a Friday night (April 6th), Mom was in town for the weekend and wanted to take her to a good Mexican place I had been to many time in the past.  Waited 30 minutes, but no big deal as we started on a pitcher of margaritas.  An interesting note to begin with is the bar setup.  They have decided to save 1/4 of the total bar space as a server prep station.  When we started to drift over the tape line into this section on the bar we were shooed by one of the bus staff, pretty rude IMO, but made me wonder.  Why the hell would you steal precious bar space to have silver, napkins and pitchers of water a place to sit.  There are many other spots that could have been created for this purpose.  On to the meal, as always love the options presented and tried a new dish with an egg on top.  Love eggs with my meal.  My mom got fajitas and loved them as well. Finishing off the meal and the original pitcher was quite a challenge as the portions are very healthy.  The margarita was the house variety and not that flavorful, pretty much watered down.  That's when the rating hit the floor.  Upon finishing my margarita, I set my glass down and notice something in my glass. Whoa, that's a roach!  Not sure exactly how it got there, whether it  was in the pitcher of margarita or in my glass the whole time, but either way, completely disgusted.   At this point all the food was gone, and so was the roach margarita, so what to do.  Well since I really value yelp reviews and this is not something I caught at the beginning of the meal I decided to hold my thoughts for this review. No getting free meals, or making a scene, because honestly the food was good and I don't like getting stared at as I explain the circumstances.  So for everyone to see as proof, I'm going to attempt to upload the photo from that night.  If a roach got into my glass I wonder what else roaches have gotten into at this restaurant.  Let's just leave it at I won't be going back.",

Service was a bit inattentive and slow, we had to wait a while for drinks, order to be taken, etc.  We knew going into it that it wasn't going to be Tex-Mex like we're used to. Chips and salsa were delicious! Couldn't figure out why the \"queso dip\" was $11, we usually pay around $5-6 in TX. Well this isn't chile con queso, it's what we call queso flameado - a skillet of melty, gooey cheese. It was really delicious!!! The red chile was overly hot. Other than that the food was pretty good. Overpriced but maybe that's just Scottsdale? I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but wouldn't mind giving it another try.",

The place has been open for a long while, and it seems to attract the locals, so I am assuming something is done right. Not so much. First, the place is charming in an old fashioned sort of way. The patio is a lovely hideaway in the busy Old Town Scottsdale, the inside of the restaurant could use a little updating. I am mostly nervous about sitting in the room to the side of the entrance. The little room is packed with tables, the windows are barred and there does not appear to be an emergency exit. In case of fire in the main room I think you're screwed. Perhaps I'm paranoid but as a meeting planner I see these things.   Now to the food and service. The place looks like grandma is in the kitchen whipping up delicious family recipes you can't get enough of. Sadly, each meal I have had has been soggy or dry and crusty, and either too spicy or lacking flavor. Grandma's authentic touch is definitely missing from the kitchen.   The service is lacking too. The hostess or servers aren't welcoming and good luck getting a refill on anything.   Need a place to hang out on the patio with a margarita and chips, this is it. For a great Mexican meal, not so much.",

I sat inside and was seated quickly at a small table by the front door. Chips salsa and water were served quickly, and I ordered the fish tacos, The price was higher than I'm used to seeing for lunch plates at $14. It seemed to take awhile for the food to come out and I went through two baskets of chips and salsa in the mean time. 20 minutes later I was served, not an exorbitant wait. But longer than it should take for some tacos on a not so busy afternoon.    The food came out, three fish tacos and the standard Mexican rice and beans. I went at the tacos to pick up and the shells fell apart as they were thin and moist. I finished them off with a fork. The filling of fish, chopped lettuce and tomato was good, but bland. The rice and beans were nothing special. I wish I could say this place is great and I can't wait to go back, but it's just average, at an above average cost.",

Menu had some good looking stuff on it. A bit pricey if you ask me.   Chips and salsa brought out were a little basic and the salsa lacked flavor. I ordered something very simple...quesadilla and rice. My aunt and uncle ordered 4 tacos .   It was far from busy and there were empty seats outside. Our order took FOREVER! Something so simple took the longest (1 hour). We had to ask the waiter several times if our order was coming out yet.   When it finally arrived , all our food was not hot at all. A warm / room temp that felt like was cooked a while ago but just being brought out. The rice was not very good and the quesadilla was OK. My aunt and uncles tacos were the same.  When it came to paying , we noticed a meal we did not order was on the bill ...good thing we caught it. My aunt and uncle are locals and come often. They agreed today was one of the worse days.   I was highly disappointed. This could be such a hip place if they got some help.",

Probably so they can charge you ANOTHER $1.75 on top the $15 fajitas which weren't good. Didn't even ask for sour cream because I'm sure that would have been more money and it didn't come with cheese. Wouldn't recommend. I was with 6 other people and one 1 person liked their food.",

The service was abrupt and rude - the waiter seemed annoyed we were even there. While there was only one table occupied when we arrived, it quickly filled up with other guests. After nearly 10 minutes we received a small bowl of chips, which we're good, but mostly broken and crumbs. When our food arrived it was lukewarm and looked like something you'd get at a bad Azteca restaurant. My chili rellenos were soggy and had cheddar or American cheese in them. What? My husband's taquitos were nearly inedible. The server showed no interest in us until it was time to pay. Very disappointed and I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",

The waitress Gabriella D was pleasant and fairly attentive ( had to chase her down for more chips and salsa , of which we found were not complimentary and came with an up charge when the bill came - something that should be communicated I think, and when spending 80 on dinner and drink no chips ! Lol ) this was our first time here ( don't worry last too )and the apathetic attitudes of the staff really did reflect their disdain which will only hurt the restaurants future business. Having pride in your service and restaurant is great for repeat business and good reviews of which neither seem too important.",

I had a combo plate.  Hubby had a beef burrito.  Very basic.  When in doubt, don't stretch the kitchen.  Both our dinners were bad. Not even warm.  Tasteless, greasy. We had to ask for hot sauce.  The only condiment on the table was salt & pepper.  To top off the nite, hubby needed to use the restroom.  You have to walk outside to get to it? I heard the table next to us commenting on how dirty the restrooms were. All I can say is,save your money.  Go somewhere else.",

I advise avoiding the pico de gallo here as it does have a solid bite. I tried my friend's chicken chimichanga which was very good. The cook chicken with onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers. We got luck and did not have to wait for a table when we arrived at 6:30. However, people arrived after us and were told the wait was 15-20 minutes or you can go around the back and eat outside on the large patio. In Arizona in the summer not the best place you want to eat and enjoy your dinner especially if you work outside like me!",

    "text": "A group of us girls went here for dinner to start out a bachelorette party last weekend. Once we arrived, it didn't take long for them to set up our table in the outdoor patio. When the first four of us sat down, the server came by to take our drink order. We asked for water while we waited for the rest of the group and the server actually rolled his eyes at us and said, \"okay\" in that snooty voice. I asked him if there was a problem with our drink order and he laughed and said no. Maybe he thought he was being funny and joking with us but it did not come out that way. A few more girls joined and by that time the servers went ahead and brought water for everyone. 15-20 minutes after they brought our waters, our server still hadn't come back to see if we wanted to order bar drinks and/or food.  We had to go up to the bar, where he was standing, and tell him he were ready. About 5 minutes later, he came to take everyone's order. After that, we barely saw him. I ordered the ceviche and the guacamole appetizer. I thought the guacamole app would just be a bowl of guacamole but it came with refried beans and chips. That was a nice surprise because I was worried about having to order extra chips and be charged for them (per other Yelp reviews). The guacamole was pretty good and I can throw down on that stuff. I also thought the salsa they brought out was extremely good. My ceviche was...interesting. I love ceviche and ordered it with the intent of something light. It came out on two tostadas with the shrimp, avocado, and salsa layered on each tostada. I definitely did not expect that but I guess that it their twist on ceviche. I found the ceviche to be very saucy, as well, almost as if it had ketchup mixed with the tomatos. It was also pretty spicy. After eating the first tostado, I just ate the toppings off the others with a fork. I liked my ceviche at Frank & Lupe but not if I knew it was ceviche. I looked around at the girls' dishes and I will say they looked pretty good. We also ordered pitchers of their house margarita ($24 each) which I thought was pretty good. Overall, I thought the food was decent, drinks good, and service terrible. Would I go back? Hmmm, not sure but I think anyplace is worth a second chance.",

If I wasn't starving and there with small children I would not have eaten that mess! Hubby had veggie burrito.. He was also not impressed.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to Frank & Lupe's for more than a year when I met a potential client there for lunch today. I don't embarrass easily...just look at the fact that I post my actual picture on my Yelp profile. I come from stout Norwegian stock (you want to talk about an internal compass that is seldom right but never uncertain and always unconcerned, it's the good Norwegian wood - gratuitous Beatles reference - that I spring from). But, jeez, I was embarrassed today! I remember this place as being better than this! Do I have early onset \"old-timers\" disease? Is my fondness for happy hours just the beginnings of a craving for \"early bird specials\"? I don't know. I got there a few minutes early and was seated and got chips and salsa (both the regular and the hot..I like the hot, but you never know about other peoples taste). So far so good...decent chips and decent salsa, although I seem to remember the chips being warm the last time I was here. It went downhill from there. My lunch meeting arrived and we chatted as we waited for our server to come and take her drink order...and waited...and waited. He finally looked at us (could it have been my frantic waving?), and dropped by the table to find out what all the fuss was about. Took her drink order and asked what we wanted  for lunch. We hadn't decided and that earned us a sniff and spin, and off he went. Another server brought her drink and we looked at the menu's while we talked business and waited for our server to return...and waited...and waited. I just want to iterate that it just wasn't that busy today...maybe 12-15 total tables, in and out, with 3 servers, so not a heavy load. Our server finally returned after another stint of waving (I had my workout this morning, but I got in a little extra upper body at F&L).  He took our orders and we waited...and waited. My fish taco's came out, and we waited for my lunch companions Holy Mole'...and waited...and waited. 5 minutes and I motioned to him (less waving this time...he was looking anxiously between us and the kitchen by now). I asked him to take my order back to the kitchen and keep it warm until both orders could be brought out together...he didn't. Instead he said the mole was coming right out, which it did (if by \"right out\" he meant 4 minutes from now). This might have all been OK, if the food had been what I thought I remembered...it wasn't...it was worse...way worse. The fish in the taco's was not fresh...little tiny chunks of fish that clearly came out of a can. I tried all three tacos, and there was some variation in the flavors, but not from the fish. The mole may have been worse. I don't know, but for someone who was looking forward to the mole to give up after a half dozen bites was not a good sign. You know, it's never a good idea to have a prospective business relationship see you switch into full jerk mode over something as trivial as a crappy lunch (although I was sorely tempted), so I paid the bill, we continued our conversation and I will probably not get to pick the restaurant the next time we dine together.  But it was a successful lunch in the business sense. I try to \"vote local\" with my dining and entertainment dollars, and I don't expect perfection, but could some of these places at least try? Canned fish in the tacos...really?!?!?! I don't think my memory is faulty...I think it was better, and I know I was looking forward to having lunch there today. Jeez...this was embarrassing!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying it takes a lot for me to write a less than positive review.  I'd rather just not review at all... but this experience was just downright upleasant.  Our party of six arrived the other afternoon and loved the ambience.  The back patio is just great and we were seated pretty As other reviewers said the chips and salsa were very good.    We got a picher of 'ritas, ordered for everyone and the food starting arriving.  When the waiter brought out an entree that nobody ordered, he looked at his pad and announced that I had ordered this dish and he was certain I had becuase \"he wrote it down\".  Well, unfortunately what he wrote wasn't what I ordered.  And no two ways about it, he was right and I was wrong.  Not the best attitude for the hospitality industry.    As a side note, none of us - including one of our party who owns a restaurant in SF and our seven year old daughter - was impressed with the food.  The chicken in the dish I was served (again not what I ordered) was dry and quite overcooked, and another person in our party actually became ill during the meal.  Whatever.  Maybe it was that the staff was overworked - our waiter was doubling as the bartender and things were pretty busy.  Still, not up to the ratings or expectations.  Everyone has a bad day I guess  All of this might have been forgivable but for the final insult.  When the check arrived, the waiter had indicated we were a party of eight (we were six) and pre-added an 18% gratuity to the check.   Now we are regular restaurant patrons.  We behave well.  We tip well.  We don't complain all the time.  BUT  this might have been a case where I'd have only tipped 15% for the argument we received - perhaps this waiter was covering his back.  I don't know.  I do know that I'll never have the chance to find out if their average rating is deserved as we'll never return.",

The tamale was a bit spicier than I was expecting. The enchilada had enough cheese to mask any kind of spiciness.   The sopillidias (not sure if I spelled it right) was interesting.

They called up to make a reservation and were informed that they dont take reservations for parties of 15 or less but to call later when we are about 30 mins away from arriving and they will put our names down on the waiting list. We did this and were told they wouldn't put our names down until we arrived.  Once we arrived, the wait time was foreverrrrrrr. We had to keep checking in with the hostess and literally pointing at open tables and asking if we could get that table. I was really ready to just leave and go somewhere else.  Once we got our food, i was content. Upon reading the recommendations of other Yelpers, I ordered the #8 and found it very tasty and the exact right portion.  While it was nice dining outside, I wouldn't wait that long for a table ever again.",

I'm pretty sure it was just sauteed vegetables in a bland flour tortilla. The burrito was also surprisingly small, I've had burritos that were easily 3x this size. I asked for hot sauce and several minutes later the waiter/bartender came back with what appeared to be a house made hot sauce. The sauce did help add some kick and flavor to the burrito, but the sauce itself was equally disappointing. A good bit of heat but very little flavor.  And then there's the service. I came on what I would assume was a slow Sunday night. I sat by myself at the bar, there was also a couple seated there. I was not offered chips and salsa, but I figured I'd pass since I wasn't super hungry and was anticipating the burrito. This is probably the only time that I've left a Mexican restaurant feeling hungry!  I ordered the dark Mexican draft beer, which was served way too warm. So there you have it, even the beer was disappointing!",

Pretty good but didn't totally wow me. Salsa was nothing to write home about. Wasn't crowded at 8pm on a Thurs. Waiter was welcoming and quick. Despite the 3 stars I'll be back next time I'm in the area to try the sopapilla or the poblano and then go across the street for some groovy cocktails! Overall, I'd give it a thumbs up",

We had to repeat our orders several times, and even then, didn't bring my friend's beer till halfway through dinner.   We asked for a refill of the chips and salsa multiple times but didn't get it. The food came out pretty quickly but was only lukewarm. I ordered the enchiladas and they were okay - flavorful but just okay.",

We got our food in about 15 minutes which is great for a Friday night. However it was not warm. Our waitress checked with us within a few bites and I mentioned that it was not warm,  which is always a tough call because you are hungry and ready to settle. She grabbed our plates and said she'd be right back. Ten minutes later she was with the tastiest Mexican food to be found in Old Town. I had a #1 combo with a releno added. Everything was excellent.  As a local, Frank and Lupe's is gonna be our go to fix for awesome Mexican food in Scottsdale from no",

We actually ended up going twice in the same trip- it was that good! Some reviews mention long waits and poor service, and that was not our experience. We were seated right away and well attended throughout the meal. However, it wasn't very crowded either time. We went at 6:30 on a Wednesday and 5:00 on a Friday. I'd expect it to get crowded on weekends, especially since it's in a cute art district. If you have time, get there early and check out the shops and galleries.   The food was delicious, starting with the chips and salsa with just the right amount of spiciness. I ordered the #8 chicken enchiladas in Pablo's I cream sauce, and the waiter said that's the best thing on the menu. It was so good! I ordered it twice, and it was different both times. Definitely the same meal, but the presentation was different and the sauce was a bit different. It was good both times though. The tostada looked delicious too. I wouldn't expect a tostada to be very filling- maybe because the last time I had one, I was 8 and it was from Taco Bell- but it was huge and piling with ground beef and guacamole. My friends had the adovado plate and the chicken and vegetables. Both looked great, and they both loved their meals.",

The restaurant has a normal inside sit-down, but also a small outdoor cantina. We luckily found a table, because it got crowded fast.   The server took a really long time to even get our drink order. My husband got his beer, and I waited for my house marg for a long time. I thought that maybe she forgot about it. But they were busy. And the margarita was legit. A bit too legit (to quit), because I had a second one while waiting for my food, and I was LIT. Even with a water in between. I don't really imbibe, so.... The mole chicken enchiladas were great. Just spicy enough, with a nice chocolaty flavor. I skipped the rice (too many carbs!), but I enjoyed the beans. The salsa and chips were also good. Fresh, warm tortilla chips, and honestly salsa with a little bite. J had the fish tacos, which he really enjoyed. He raved about the rice as well. Though we did a whole lot of waiting, and I ended up toasted before my food got there (light weight), I enjoyed Frank & Lupe's, and will certainly be back.",

So my mom and I decided to try Frank & Lupe today for lunch. We walked in and were immediately sat a  table inside the restaurant with menus. I was not happy with how long it took someone to come over to take our drink order. I did not time it but It was long enough to where my mom was like should be leave. Our waiter took our drink order but forgot \"lemon\" for our waters. Fast forward to our food coming out, I ordered Fish tacos and my mom ordered cheese enchiladas both dishes came with rice and beans. Also note we were provided basket of chips with salsa. If you order another basket of chips with salsa it's $2.00(whew) most places it's free.   Fish Tacos - Three grilled white fish served in corn tortilla with pico and iceberg lettuce. I did not like the iceberg lettuce with warm fish... It does not make for good combination, I believe this should be left off fish tacos. The lettuce is soggy by the time it gets to plate. The rice/beans were okay.   Cheese enchiladas - Three cheese enchiladas rolled in corn tortillas with shredded cheese on top. My mom enjoyed the plate. I asked her would she order again.. She replied yes it was good!   Parking - Street parking around the restaurant available within block or two. Also there is plenty of shops to browse after your done eating.",

    "text": "We visited Frank & Lupe's on a road trip five years ago and enjoyed an authentic (American) Mexican dinner in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. So, when we ate dinner there tonight, we were really looking forward to that same dinner. Not so much. We arrived at 5:00 p.m. on a holiday weekend and there were plenty of seats. Not a good sign. We then ordered Margaritas, which were delicious but overpriced. My son ordered an Arnold Palmer but they could not make it because they ran out of lemonade. Chips and salsa were tasty and fresh. But, everything went downhill from there.   I ordered the combination plate with red sauce and the only thing I tasted was the burning sensation from too hot of sauce. As part of my dinner, I ordered a chichen taco but received a tasteless ground beef taco instead. The dinner also included a tamale and enchilada but I could not eat either them because they were too hot.   My son ordered the chili rellano plate but they were too greasy, the cheese had the consistency of cheese whiz, and they were mostly ineatable.   Finally, my wife had the chicken fajitas that smelled and looked delicious but the chicken was over cooked and dry.   Sad to say that this was my last trip to Frank & Lupe's.",

Unfortunately, there was one waitress serving about a half dozen tables  on the patio while tending the bar, so service was slow throughout our visit.  The salsa was a notch above taco sauce from a bottle, not a good start.  One of my favorite dishes is carne adovada, with it's rich, smoky, sometimes spicy flavor, so I went with the carne adovada plate.  Wow, was this one a disappointment!   The meat, usually moist and fall off the bone tender,  was dry and chewy.  The sauce was primarily tomato based, and lacked the kind of flavor that you find at Los Dos Molinos or Carlsbad Tavern.  And it was over salted.  The accompanying beans and rice were forgettable, the 2 sopapillas that came with the meal were OK.  For what it's worth, though, the table of visitors from Wisconsin next to ours seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Hasta la vista, Frank and Lupe.",

I had heard about Frank and Lupe's through Yelp so I had some high expectations, but unfortunately I was disappointed. We showed up for dinner around 9:15 and decided to sit outside on their heated patio; which was the highlight of the evening. We waited about 10 minutes for our server to come by and take our drink order, and eventually our food order. We had also ordered an order of guacamole as fellow Yelp users raved about the guacamole, but we didn't get it before our dinner arrived, rather in the middle of it, when we had already gone through 2 baskets of chips (which cost $2 after the first basket!). I do have to say that their margaritas are really tasty; I ordered a Cazadores margarita on the rocks with salt, yum!; for dinner, I ordered the #8 I believe, the spinach and cheese enchiladas with verde sauce. The sauce on the enchiladas was really zesty, and the spinach added a much needed freshness to the dish; rice and beans were also good. Our bill came, and eventually the server came back to run through the credit card. My family and I left with high expectations not being met, and saying, \"I probably wouldn't come back here again.\"",

    "text": "Best Mexican/New Mexican restaurant around.  My family and I have been eating here almost every week for years.  Their salsa is the absolute best; just the right amount of heat, chunks of onion, and large sprigs of cilantro....truly divine!  Frank and Lupes subscribes to the \"quality\" over \"quantity\" philosophy that is to the detriment of many other local mexican eateries.  My favorites are Taco's De Charro, Chicken Mole, Shredded Beef Burrito's (the meat is succulent and perfectly seasoned), and their Veggie Burrito which is hands down the best in town.  Some of the gripes from fellow yelpers about Frank and Lupes are down right comical to me.  Complaints about tables being close together and people being able to hear your conversations are issues at most restaurants that are busy by virtue of serving a great product.  Frank and Lupes is not the Melting Pot and shame on you for blaming an eatery for not living up to your baseless preconcieved notions.  As a service industry veteran, I know that some are very adept at the art of dis-satisfaction.  Thank goodness for those of you who \"will not be back\", My wait for a table every week just got a bit shorter.",

Unfortunately its the only Mexican place in Old Town that can handle a big group of people, and some of my friends seems to think its a good option, so we end up here again and again after the Coach House.  Its nothing but Sysco cans, barely reheated.  I ordered fajitas tonight, which turned out to be boiled chicken, on a sliver of iceburg lettuce, and some runny \"guacamole\" (some kind of green slime).  The tortillas were stale, cold, and awful.  There were some raw onions.  Nothing had been cooked, the rice was cold and congealed.  I've had just about everything on the menu, and its all terrible. The worst part is that the margaritas are from a high fructose corn syrup mix. This place makes its money on the tourists coming to spring training.  The location is great, and the old house is charming.  It has tons of potential, but I can not believe how bad the food is, and has been for years. The drive- through 'Bertos places are 50 times better. There are scores of good chips and salsa joints in this city, and its so unfortunate that we keep ending up at this hole in the earth. I wish I could give it negative stars.  I can't possibly see how it stays in business except for the tourist trade.",

Our party of 6 was served 2 tiny handfuls of chips in a basket, which we promptly decimated.  When our waiter finally ambled over to take our order, we asked for more chips.  Waited, waited...food was served, still no chips.  We requested more.  My order was supposed to come with sopapillas, I pointed out that they were missing.  Midway through the meal someone stopped by, we again mentioned we would like more chips, and the sopapillas that were part of the meal.  After 3 requests we finally got our chips.  Meal was finished, still no sopapillas.  Requested those 4 times!  Finally the waiter threw them on the table and left, no apology, nothing.  Food was lukewarm; we were starving and knew that if we commented about the temperature we would never have eaten that night.  Bill comes...not only do they charge $4 for the chips, but they tacked on 2 mystery people to the table, thus incurring an automatic 20% tip!  We requested to speak to the manager.  After waiting and waiting he finally came to the table.  We politely explained the whole situation (piss poor service, sneaking in a 20% tip to the bill).  All he says is \"we'll take it off\".  That's it!  He's was even more disinterested than the waiter!  Don't eat here unless you want to experience horrible service, be overcharged, and want to wait around twiddling your thumbs.",

It is charming, and looks authentic.  Much like the restaurants down in Tucson.  The chips and salsa came out quick, and the service was great.  Chips and salsa were very good.  However, I was disappointed that you only get one serving, and then you have to pay $3 for another....something that I have never seen before.  But sadly, this is was the only positive for the restaurant.  I had a #1 and the person I was eating with had flat enchiladas.  If this is the best Phoenix has to offer, I feel bad for anyone living here.  The food lacked flavor, the green chili sauce tasted like they opened a can and poured it on top.  Beans and rice were not good at all.  The sopapillas were good, but that is not hard to mess up.  Also way overpriced for what you get.   Do yourself a favor, and find another restaurant.  Not worth your time.",

I said I see your food is Mexican. It says that on the door but what region is it from? Oaxaca, Senora, Baja? One of the employees then said it is New Mexican. I asked so is it Americanized Mexican Food? I was then told there is a pepper that only grows in New Mexico that all the food is flavored with. I asked what are the vegetarian entrees. The employee told me she could not remember and left me to read through the menu until I found one. They also had some cookies called bruschettitos. I said to the employee, \"I know bruschetta are twice baked cookies. What kind of cookies are these? Mexican wedding cookies?\" She said she did not know but she said they are really good with milk or coffee. I ordered a vegetarian burrito which came with a side of beans and rice. I ordered this to go. The burrito is the worst burrito I have ever had. I ate one bite and could not eat any more. I could eat two bites of the rice. Only the pinto beans were good. The employees do not seem to know anything about the food they are serving. Apparently one employee thinks Mexico is a region of Mexico.",

The abodoba burrito had hunks of tender, savory beef, with cooked for hours flavor and the rolled enchiladas were wonderful too.

    "text": "There have to be some considerations made when attending Frank and Lupe's: First off, you have to understand that it's not GREAT Mexican food. That is to say, it's not real high quality, but more of what you would get at your buddies grandma's house. The second is that the service is somewhat spotty at times. You give your order to the \"waiter\", who then disappears as you are serviced throughout the nite by the \"bus boys\". Getting the check is the hardest thing there is.   Having said all that, this place is TAST-TEE! I can't get enough of their enchilada's. If you're lucky enough to be there when they are doing their Poblano Chile enchiladas, get them! They are amazing. The chicken mole enchilada plate is also incredibly delicious. And sopapilla's??? WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?! Drizzle some honey on these bad boys and enjoy throughout the meal.   Like I said, you have to understand what you're getting into with Frank and Lupe's and if you can look past a few of their shortcomings, the food, atmosphere, and prices here are some of the best in town!",

My husband is a doctor and he reported this to the health department but they said they have to wait until more people report a problem!  We called the restaurant and they didn't seem to care.  My two sons and daughter in law are all still sick.   They didn't eat anything but ice cream after the lunch and one son didn't even eat that.  So it had to be Frank & Lupe's.  I am so upset.  We drove home to CA with one son who was so sick in the car.  The sick ones are young healthy people.  Sure hope no children or old people eat there until they solve this problem!!!!!!",

    "text": "We went here because it was recommended by the locals and had good reviews in the tour guide book.  The patio was neat, with fun decorations. The mexican food was average. The salsa was too watery, just a little heat to it.  The  guacamole was good, it was creamy with small chunks of avocado in it. The pinto beans tasted like they came out of a can. One plus is they have pitchers of beer and margaritas.  The one star is for the staff/service.  They were slow moving and never came back to the table to check on us after we got our food. It felt like we were inconveniencing them. They didn't give us a refill on the chips until we asked two different servers. Mind you, it was a small plastic basket to begin with, we were not total pigs. I paid an extra 3.50 for the guacamole, the least they could do was bring me some chips with it!  I would pass on the food, hang out at the bar for a beer to get the atmosphere and move on. I would have been happier with the food and service at the Baja Grill across the street.",

You would think paying $3.00 for a soda you would at least be offered 1 refill.  Value - See above! 2 small baskets of chips and salsa for 6 people. If you want more they are $2.00 each!! Meal value was average.   Overall - we waited almost 1 hour to be seated for a party of 6. When we were seated, we got a table for 4 with 2 extra chairs. Not complaining about the table, just the wait. I would understand if they had to pair 2 tables but we all sat at a standard size table. Service was aweful. Probably would not return. There are a million other mexican joints within a 2 mile radius.If it wasn't for the great company we had, I probably would have been mad but we were with good friends and just rolled with it.",

    "text": "After reading some of the less than stellar reviews I feel obligated to review one of the best Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. Even if it isn't exactly an authentic representation of the traditional variety.   The staples here are excellent. The chips are fresh and a bit heartier than most. They are, indeed... delicious. The red salsa is of mild-to-medium heat and complements their companions well. The beans are also very tasty, not refried and smothered in cheese like some well-known offenders. The rice is tender and flavorful. Together with some fresh flour tortillas and you experience what is know as harmony.   The chicken mole enchiladas are easily my favorite dish here, with the mole being slightly sweet and mildly spiced. The hard tacos here can be a bit greasy, which I admittedly enjoy on occasion. The red enchilada sauce is pretty decent as well. I think I have also had the tamales here, but do not remember them standing out.  It's a pretty cool spot too with a patio and bar out back. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. Sure, you can get better elsewhere in the valley, but Frank and Lupe's is always a solid choice.",

    "text": "A very poor excuse for Mexican food.  We arrived at lunch to find the place packed and had a bit of a wait, which despite the run-down lackluster interior, we viewed the popularity as a positive sign that we were in for some great food.  We were finally seated and were provided with food-covered menus and a basket of chips and watery, flavorless salsa.  The waiter finally came over to take our order after a long wait at which time we also requested some silverware and napkins.  After another ten minutes, he finally brought us some water and some well used silverware rolled in a paper napkin.  One would have thought that with salsa so watery, they would have provided us with some plates to prevent dripping all over the table, but the overall lack of cleanliness of the place seemed to suggest otherwise.  The chips themselves were greasy and bland and we only consumed some of them because we were both famished.  After another lengthy wait, my veggie burrito finally arrived. I only managed to get through a few bites of this greasy, flavorless disaster before calling it quits and heading back to the office still hungry.  The burrito consisted of nothing more than soggy, overly greasy, limp, overcooked vegetables, of which spinach was the predominant variety.  There was no flavor to any of it or any spice, sauce, etc. that would give one the impression of eating Mexican food.  I have absolutely no idea why people would flock to this place.  The atmosphere is that of a dirty cafe with tables packed on top of each other and the food is beyond horrible.  While I avoid fast food at all costs, I can honestly say that I would eat at Taco Bell before ever coming back to Frank & Lupe's.",

The decor is colorful, with bright paintings on the wall and blue and white striped curtains hanging on the windows.  The chips and salsa are really good, and the efficient servers rarely have you waiting more than a few minutes for a refill (if you sit inside).  And the menu is filled with taco plates, enchilada plates, burritos, chalupas and much, much more.  Many of the dinners come with sopapillas and everything I've had there, including the smothered burrito, enchiladas, veggie burrito and chalupa are all delicious.    The red sauce is especially good- very flavorful and more than a little spicy for a wimp like me.  But that didn't stop me from enjoying it, I just needed four glasses of water to go along with it!  If you sit on the patio, you may not get as good of service, but the ambience is even better.

    "text": "This place is the main setting of one of the most miserable nights of my life that didn't involve someone dying or me throwing up on my date or something.  Anyway, I'll spare those details and just focus on what a terrible experience this restaurant was.  To begin let me state in the interest of full disclosure that I live in Dallas.  This affords me the opportunity to eat some damn fine Tex-Mex, but it does not make me a Mexican snob.  I'm every bit as comfortable eating at a chain in my native St. Louis as I am at some of the better places I have found in Dallas or anywhere else.  All I ask is that it is good.  Frank and Lupe's is not good.  The people in my party wanted Mexican and several people affiliated with our hotel recommended Frank and Lupe's as the \"BEST MEXICAN IN TOWN!!\"  I see that in some of the reviews here, too.  Either these people are getting kick backs or Scottsdale has a seriously terrible Mexican restaurant scene.  First off, upon our arrival we were quoted a wait time of 35 minutes inside and an hour on the patio.  Ok, guess we're eating inside, no problem.  Unfortunately, 35 minutes turned into nearly an hour to sit in the hot, cramped dining area.  We would have been much better off waiting for the patio and taking our chances.  There are few restaurant sins bigger than undershooting the wait time by almost half.  Off by 5 or 10 minutes?  Still crappy but it happens.  20+ minutes?  No excuse.  This highlights another problem with this place.  It is tiny.  There is no place to wait.  I guess we could have squeezed into the over-full patio and hoped for the best, but otherwise you're standing out on the street on a tiny crowded sidewalk with all the other unfortunate souls about to be subjected to the horrors that are apparently \"the best Mexican in town\".  As you can imagine, after waiting an hour for a table, our party was starving.  Luckily we were at a Mexican place, so we knew we were getting chips and salsa, so we waited...and waited...and waited and finally we hounded the hostess after 10 minutes of sitting there with nothing on the table.  Then we got the \"chips\" which were actually more like some thick bastard offspring of a chip and a taco bell chalupa shell.  Did I mention they were cold, too?  Warm chips can hide a magnitude of crimes, but not at Frank and Lupe's.  And the salsa was some watery, runny mess.  Yuck.  And what's that I see on the menu?  $2 for more chips?  Luckily the chips were terrible and they would have had to pay me $2 to take more of them, but seriously?  No one I have mentioned this to since has ever seen a charge for chips at a Mexican restaurant.  Was I reading this wrong?  Is this only if I don't order anything besides chips?  Surely it was, right?  Moving on...after another good 10 minutes our waiter finally came around for our orders.  I ordered a number 6. I was presented a choice of a green or red sauce.  Being from out of town I asked for the waiter's opinion.  He told me he would get the red but \"its a little spicy.\"  This is important because it was the exaggeration of the century.  Before the meal came out I had finished my first diet coke.  Of course I did because it was like 30 minutes between getting the diet coke and getting the food.  Anyway, I specifically waited for another diet coke before I started the \"little spicy\" meal.  Then I dig in and I eat...and I eat...and I eat.   In fact, I finished the entire entree before I even felt a hint of spice in my mouth, and even then it wasn't much more robust than Medium Pace picante sauce.  Huge disappointment.  To tell the truth, the whole meal was bland.  There was basically no flavor even under the \"little spicy\" (emphasis on little, I guess) sauce and the rice was  apparently just plain rice with a little shredded cheese melted onto it.  So, we finished our meal, all massively disappointed, and then it was another 10 minutes until we could get the check and then after that we had to flag down another hostess to actually pay the check because our waiter was MIA.  You might say it was because they were busy, but we didn't start eating until almost 8 and by the time we were done closer to 9, the restaurant was at least half empty.  The biggest disappointment for me is how many interesting sounding places I passed by walking to this place.  Unfortunately, my party wanted Mexican and the hotel suggested this dump.  I had one meal out on the town in Scottsdale, on an expense account to boot, and I wasted it on this utterly forgettable hole in the wall disaster.  In fact, I take that back.  I will never forget Frank and Lupe's.  It goes on the Wall of Shame.  Learn from my error, fellow Yelpers.",

I was so disappointed, but starving so I ate it.  The guacamole was really disappointing too.  I don't think we will go back again.",

Thought it was weird since it was Monday night at 8pm...but there is a wait. They have exactly- one server, one busser, and one bartender serving food to help out. We only waited about 15 minutes..not bad. We sit down, wait about 15 minutes to see a server...we decide what we want to eat by the time he actually gets there. He takes our drink order and as my friend starts to give her food order, he walks away. He comes back takes our order...we never see that guy again until the bill. When our food came, our entrees were supposed to have tortillas...but no tortillas. I got the Carne Adovada plate which was SUPER salty and had no flavor at all. It was as if they mixed masa with it to thicken it but didn't blend it well. My friend got the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were pretty good, nothing great and my other friend got seafood enchiladas which had hardly any filling to the enchiladas. I asked 3 times for the tortillas...that never came. Our waiter came after we were done with our food and asked if we wanted more drinks. We were done at that point.",

Great, efficient service both times.  Great food both times.  I forget the names of what I've ordered, but it's always fresh and mouth-watering.  The margaritas are big and decent.  They seemed stiffer on my first visit, a little more watered-down on my most recent visit.   Of course, my second visit was at happy hour, so maybe that had something to do with it.  Great chips and salsa.  Sopapillas were a novelty, but very good.  I plan to go back whenever I'm in the area if for no other reason that the patio- it's really an oasis in the middle of Old Town.",

Ok so where do I begin, the mole here is awesome, they also have an amazing poblano sauce that was featured on the food network. The food is a cross between traditional Mexican food and New Mexican food.   The enchiladas are not the traditional enchiladas you might expect, which is what makes them so delicious. They offer stacked New Mexican enchiladas that are topped with an egg, or rolled enchiladas that are a bit more traditional and topped with really flavorful grilled chicken.  The green chile soup will knock out any hangover or cold in minutes, and it's impossible to finish! I also love their cheese crisp topped with shredded beef. In addition they have excellent HAND MADE taquitos and flautas. Yes hand made! Not the frozen ones from the grocery store. In addition they also have an amazing shrimp Diablo dish.   The patio is really nice and quiet and the margaritas are awesome! I can't stand weak margaritas! You won't have that problem here. They are also very close to the SF Giants spring training park but, for the record I'm a diehard A's fan.   This place gets packed! The food is amazing, the drinks are amazing, and the pricing is very affordable. My hats off to Teddy and Eddie! Thanks for making sure the food and service are always consistent and excellent. The only issue I've ever had is deciding which amazing dish to order. Thank you!",

We walked in the door, were basically thrown menus, and waited 7 mins for anyone to acknowledge us (and this place is small and it was not busy!). When we finally were greeted, we asked for a margarita and a michelada. The drinks arrived - no joke- 10 minutes later, and my margarita was repulsive. It tasted like watered down sweet and sour with salt. After once again waiting for the man to return, my husband mentioned his michelada was gross and we asked for the check right away, again waiting for at least 5 mins. We had to get up and demand our check. If the food is good, we'll never know, because this is the worst service in old town Scottsdale. Oh- and there is no bathroom, so good luck if you need a restroom or need to wash your hands. I believe there's a bathroom outside behind the building that is shared like an outhouse.

SERVICE: Our waiter was very friendly and made some great recommendations to his favourite dish and drinks, the spicy level of dishes.  FOOD: I ordered a sangria $7 and fish tacos approx $12. I'm not very experienced in Mexican food but the fish tacos seemed quite authentic to me. There's 3 soft tacos. The fish, although fried, was not too oily for my taste, which I quite liked. It also comes with rice, beans, and pico de gallo (salsa).   I'd come back again for drinks with friends - the ambience is lovely!",

Maybe every third time it's not terrible, but mostly it is. Tonight we took a friend and I warned him about the service, and of course, it was worse than even I expected. More than an hour wait for food to be delivered. No refills or staff on hand. The location is great and if you have time, it is good food. But if you are in a hurry, skip this place. Go to TeePee on Indian School and 42nd street. The food there is great too but way way better service and you won't be stuck with an empty drink or salsa. If you do go, just go knowing you will have to wait.",

What Mexican restaurant runs out of tequila?   My party of 5 was seated within 15 minutes of our arrival and were told that 'this crew is kind of slow'.  KIND OF???  It took probably 20 minutes to get water and our drinks ordered (only a few of the beers on the menu were available and NO TEQUILLA).  Chips and salsa didn't arrive for another 20 minutes.   We ordered food but waited an hour before we finally cashed out and gave up.  Other tables around us were still waiting for their food though they had ordered before us.  The 'manager' was looking at FB or something on his phone as we walked out, enthusiastically asked us how everything was and was shocked to find out that we had not been served though he didn't seem to care to repair the damage.  I've visited before, the food is good but the service is NOT WORTH the frustration.  It's a wonder this place is still in business, they shouldn't be.",

    "text": "Yowza, if I could give this spot -5 stars, I would.  As mentioned in earlier reviews, service is truly non-existent.  It's quite remarkable at the level of 'who gives a crap' that is on display here.  I took a co-worker there for a holiday lunch, as she has a dish there she is crazy about. We arrive at one, and are seated right away. Drinks get to us eventually and we are able to order. My friend ordered a house special, and I ordered steak fajitas.  While waiting for lunch to arrive, our drinks ran dry, and we also ran out of chips. While the restaurant was slow, with only a handful of tables occupied- the service was still a complete disaster. The wait staff was five feet away behind the bar hanging out, not paying any attention to anything.  Eventually our food arrives, and they must have invented a new strain of white beef, because my steak fajitas are white and look like chicken nuggets, only drier. I asked our befuddled server if I was looking at chicken, and he smiled and replied that it was. I reminded him that I ordered steak, at which point he made a gas face. There was no attempt at service delivery, making it right, etc. To end the silent standoff, I told him I would just give the chicken a go.  I am really laid back, and I like chicken, so I thought it might taste okay. As it turned out, the chicken was SO dry, and it was shaped like chicken nuggets. I have never seen chicken shaped like that, that was not part of  a meal you order at a drive thru. Moving past the shape, they were dry and truly tasteless. To replicate this dish, you would need old chicken, no flavor, and a hatred for the people you were cooking for.  Wrapping up the cluster that was our lunch, my friend ordered some takeout to bring back to her co-worker. We waited for another 20 minutes and no one ever showed up at our table, so I went to the bar and asked about our bill and takeout. Finally I was able to pay and get the takeout bag, which I gave to my pal. I jokingly told her to check it and make sure it wasn't screwed up too, and she did. *** Spoiler alert, they messed up the takeout too. It was completely wrong. I brought the container to the server who replied with \"Wow, everything is messed up.\" Cheers to you, good sir- we agree!  While they went to fix it, I saw inside the kitchen, and it was pretty dirty. I can truly say that was my last and final trip to Frank and Lupe's. The food isn't terrible, but the service, price point, and utter lack of giving a shite make it a no go for me. There clearly is no one there to manage the business and ensure that people are being cared for, and that quality control is happening. Do yourself a favor and find another spot.  Hell, at this point Taco Bell on Thomas & Scottsdale is a better option. At least you know going into it that the food will be mediocre.",

    "text": "My friend was in town helping her sister get settled at ASU and they were in the mood for some close to authentic Mexican food. It's kind of a hidden gem, I've passed by this place tons of times while in the area and never even noticed it. I joined everyone on the patio and we immediately ordered a round of margaritas. They had the misters and the fans going so surprisingly it was bearable on the patio. I loved the ambiance of the patio, it's not super chic or anything but it's comfortable and makes you feel like you're on vacay somewhere near a beach :-)   The margaritas were tasty but this is where it started to go downhill for me...the service here is terrible, awful, slow, confusing, and a whole bunch of other words I'm not going to list. After we got our margs we sat with our menus in hand for a good 20 min! We didn't notice at first because we were chatting but after a while we were out of chips and salsa and noticed no one had come over to take our order. After we flagged down a server he took our orders, we asked for a refill on the chips and and salsa and water while we waited for our entrees and of course that never made it to our table. As we looked over to the bar area we noticed the servers and bartenders and servers chatting it up and watching the game, UNACCEPTABLE.   Our food came out surprisingly fast! I ordered the shrimp enchiladas with half red and half greens sauce, it came with the standard rice and black beans. It was pretty yummy the sauces had a kick to them and mixed well with the cheeses.   If I wasn't having such a great time with my friends I would have definitely asked to speak to a manger. I wanted to give this place at least 3 stars but the bad service completely overshadowed my experience at this restaurant.",

Their refried pinto beans have plenty of partial beans in the mix so it's not just liquid beans like most restaurants.  Hard tacos and soft are equally delicious!  The guacamole is fresh, hand made.  They recently started serving La Victoria beer-amazing and made by the same company as Pacifico!  The only negative I have is that they recently changed their rice!  It was a bright yellow, traditional Mexican style.  Now the rice is a bland, watery type (A friend told me it's now a Puerto Rican style).  The back outdoor patio is very clean and decorated well-a couple of TVs show sports.  I'm very surprised the Yelp ranking is overall just a 3.  I've been eating in Old Town for 14 years and this is the first place I tell my friends to go for great Mexican food!",

    "text": "I get to visit Scottsdale once every 5 years or so on average.   And that is plenty for me but that's another story.     Some of the locals were raving about this place.   They told us the food was top notch and you will never find anything better.   Throwing caution to the wind, we decided to try this place.   Boy were we surprised.     You have to understand, this is a hole in the wall joint.   I usually like those places because they try harder to keep their customers coming back and the food is not pre-made.     I should have known things were going to be bad when we got into the restaurant and met the hostess.   She is a dwarf, or midget or what ever the difference is, I don't know.   Let's just use the PC term and say \"Little Person\".    Well, we were not greeted by a smile, but just a look that said \"What the hell are you staring at?\"  Ok, I am not a jerk nor am I trying to be, I just made eye contact with her and told her to get us a table for 2.   This gal puts us in the enclosed patio which, while air conditioned, is where they seated two families with unruly kids between 3 and 8 years old.   (Watch for my upcoming review of Scottsdale later.)     Ok, so this hostess brings silverware, chips and menus at different times.  Each time she stopped by, we made eye contact, smiled and said thanks.   Still, we got the glare of death from this woman.   Ok, whatever, we tried to be nice.   So after that, any time she brought something over we barely even acknowledged her.  That seemed to work out the best.   The waitress was a little better, although she had a hard time talking over the little monsters in the room with us.   I found out if you want to drink your beer out of a glass rather than a can or bottle, you have to ASK for a glass.   Ok. Fine, I can adapt to that as well. By this time, I am thinking the food better be freakin' awesome.     Well, dear reader, you have seen the rating I gave it so you can figure it out for yourself.   My dining companion had a chicken mole dish and I had a beef chimichanga.    The mole sauce was way too smoky.   It didn't have any of the rich, smooth or savory flavors it's supposed to have.   It's almost like we were eating something that had been smoked over a hickory pit for a month.   Surprisingly, the chimmy wasn't bad at all.   The shredded beef was cooked and seasoned just right.   So, I have to give them high marks for that.   The standard rice and beans sides were very forgettable.   Hopefully you are not too hungry when you go there as the serving sizes are not that generous.     Will I go back?   No.   I will try most everywhere else in Scottsdale before returning there.",

Like most everyone, if agree that service was pretty slow. Not as bad as some people but considering the number of staff I saw and the small place, not the most efficient. I ordered Franks Enchilada plate. Basically like a Mexican lasagna. Tortilla layered with beans, meat, sauce and then repeated two more times topped by a sunny side egg. Hence the warning about eating undercooked food next to it.  On the menu I noticed meat was $2 extra so since it was already $10 I decided to go lite. When the waiter took my order, he asked if I wanted chicken or beef like it came with it and I just had to choose. Not \"did I want to add it to my meal\". Figuring I read the menu wrong I choose chicken. When the bill came, I saw that $2 charge. The waiter was nice enough but that left a bad taste in my mouth.  As for the entree it was good though. The sopapillas that it comes with I thought were pretty lacking. It's flat pieces of dough that are fried. Normally fried anything is good but this was meh. I agree with one yelper, it should come out after the meal, not during.  And it should come out hot. It was cold fried dough served with bottle of honey.  I would have normally rated this place with 2 stars bc of the not so honestness of the waiter but the 3rd star goes out to the bus woman who I think worked the hardest at customer service there. She was pleasant and helpful when we needed here. Since we didnt see our waiter that often, she made a difference. She's the one who took care of us better. Props to her!",

It's a cute little place, with charm, and old style architecture. The many times I have been here, service has been OK, and the food is nothing authentic but it is still decent.   Today, I decided to have a nice lunch with my boyfriend and we got seated right away. We waited around 7-10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. The waiter came over and asked what we liked to drink. We ordered 2 waters, a pepsi, and a margarita. When the server came back, he forgot our waters and had to remind him 10 minutes later. Previously we had ordered our food and came out incredibly fast which was awesome! After that, we were completely ignored. Pepsi wasn't refilled. He hadn't asked how everything was or if we needed anything else. Pretty much made our dining experience very unpleasant.   I work for Fox restaurants which has a great reputation for awesome food and excellent service. I more than anyone understand when things don't run smoothly or people make mistakes but my god, he was literally looking around the small room to see what needed to be done and his awareness level was at a 3. When we were all done, he finally asked if we were \"ok\" and he took our plates away. Did not ask us if we wanted dessert or anything. The bill was 42$ and left him a $4 tip which makes me feel terrible but I know he was definitely not working for it.  I am extremely disappointed this time and don't think I will be coming back for a while.",

    "text": "I've been to Frank & Lupes more times then I can count because of its close location and great food. Everything I've tried has been delicious especially the enchiladas and shredded beef tacos. Margaritas are nice and tasty too. Chips and Salsa are addictive but only the first bowl is free. Refills are $2. (Always get them on the come back...)   The service however is lacking. More then one occasion, I would have to flag down a waiter for water, refills and even the bill. Sitting in the dining room versus the covered patio makes no difference in service. I have never been to the patio area out back. But if you are in the mood for good Mexican food and you are not in a hurry, this is a good place. (I have to disclose that I have only been here on Friday nights where service is extremely slow. I recently stopped by early Saturday Night and the service was attentive! So maybe it's just the staff on weeknights.)",

We had a 20-30 minute wait last Saturday night - totally expected. Surprised it was not longer. Place was packed!   Server was quick, and the food was extremely good. I had the chicken mole enchiladas and they were delicious. Chips were very good - and I do not know what people are complaining about with the salsa. It was 'different than other Mexican restaurants'  but I think that too is one of the things that sets this restaurant apart - in a good way!  Service was attentive, yet unobtrusive. I will look forward to returning to Frank and Lupe's.",

Don't expect your water to have lemon even if you ask and the chlorine/chemical stuff that tastes worse than tap water will be given to you. Your waiter will never come back only someone with a \"bad attitude\" from the kitchen that if you don't answer their question fast enough your food will just be dropped in front of you. If you are stunned with the lack of anything related to \"fine dining\" but moreover a 100% \"Tourist Trap\" then you will run and never look back. Yes I live here and yes I have had some food prepared OK in the past but I always leave \"pissed off\" angry, hungry and wishing I had not donated my money to the \"jerks\" that run the place. The food is bland and is less than a \"Taco Bell\" in terms of any value. The cooks that wait on you have a totally \"bad attitude\" and they know what kind of crap they are serving so don't be surprised if you try to actually eat there expecting anything at all. Terrible food, terrible service and a depressing place to be.",

The service was indifferent, rude, and was clearly not interested in us just like the previous visit. We were seated right in the main dining room so no matter what our server had to do, he had to walk by us each and every time. He forgot drinks, food was served to us cold, didn't even bring the appetizer we ordered. If he tried any harder to ignore us, it would have been downright funny.   The biggest turn off was the glass of water he served to one of my dinner guests which was rimmed with ANTS. It was almost like they dipped the rim of the glass into a whole pile of the dead ants before serving it. How he missed it, I'll never know. It was disgusting. Not an apology. Not a discount offered. Nothing.   This was the most piss-poor service I have received in a restaurant in a long time and you can bet your last dime it's the last time Frank & Lupe's will ever see me or the 8 other guests I brought.",

I just flagged down the first person I saw and asked where I could sit.  There have been lots of reviews on what the restaurant looks like, so I'm going straight to the food.  We ordered the chimichangas and enchiladas.  The salsa that came with the chips was okay.  It could've used some cilantro to brighten it up.  The two entrees was nothing special.  Rice was a little dry, beans okay.  The chimi had a lot of beef in it, but the sauce was not that great.  The enchiladas were flimsy and drenched in this forgettable poblano cream sauce.  I thought the food was.. well like the rating says meh.  I wouldn't recommend anyone going there if they have a kick for Mexican food.  There are plenty of other places around that taste better.  For upscale, I'd try Spotted Donkey or Mission.  For something a little more relaxed, just take scottsdale south, and there'll be Los Sombreros on the right side.",

We have been for lunch and then around 7 pm and it's been moderately busy and service has been good. Staff is friendly and accommodating.

The best dishes are from the Santa Fe style of Mexican food and best of all there ain't no stinkin'  tomatoes in the enchilada sauce. I personally recommend to go no further on the menu than the Frank's platter with extra red sauce...It's a dish that's been around for centuries and for obvious reasons. Everything is freshly made...and in the past I've brought my own container and purchased the red sauce to take back to the east coast... Oh yeah, say hi to Teddy, the owner, if he's there, Frank's younger son, great guy...",

Lesson #1.....Never listen to an out-of-towner on Mexican restaurant recommendations.    Living in Scottsdale since 1980 I can see why my friends have always suggested other Mexican restaurants in town.  Weak drinks, very slow service, greasy chips and a fajita dinner on a dinner plate instead of a sizzling iron skillet.  I told my neighbor on Christmas Eve that we went to Frank & Lupes and his comment to me was \"WHY??\".   I would rather drive out to San Tan Village to Cantina Laredo than suffer through another Frank & Lupe's experience again.",

The patio was not busy either.  I ordered the Chile Relleno plate.  It didn't take too long to come out, because it was clearly microwaved.  I picked up a fork full of rice and they had spread a handful of shredded cheese on top, then microwaved it, (I could tell because the whole spread of shredded cheese came up with my fork on a little pull of rice).  The rice was old, not fresh at all.  The Chile Relleno was more than likely frozen, it was definitely not fresh, not authentic AT ALL.  I ordered an ice tea, and it was warm.  I had to ask the bartender on the patio for a slice of lemon.  The waitress was nice, *when I saw her, but the food was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  I could get better at Filiberto's.  Save your money, SO DISAPPOINTING.  I should have asked for a refund, but, you know, live and learn.  VISITORS TO SCOTTSDALE, DO NOT EAT HERE.  GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!  This restaurant gives Old Town Scottsdale a bad name.",

We arrived around 1130 and the patio was wide open but by noon all the tables were filled with locals and tourists alike.  Prices are very reasonable, around 8-10 bucks each and we enjoyed a couple of great margaritas in the warm Arizona sunshine.  The chicken tacos were good, but the standout was the soft chicken tacos covered in poblano cream sauce - unbelievably good.  We also liked their chips and salsa.  Service was a bit uneven but we didn't mind, it was great to escape the winter and just bathe in the warmth.",

It's nothing to write home about, but with all the food option in the area, this is the closest you will get to traditional Mexican food. However, the restaurant is usually busy including the patio cantina so expect to wait a bit. You can order beers and homemade margaritas at the bar while you wait though. Service is also a little slow due to how busy the place is but they manage to do their best and the free chips and salsa with refill make the wait bearable.",

Unfortunately, the service and food just aren't the same.   My mom and I popped in here for a late lunch last Saturday around 2:30 PM. It wasn't super busy and we just wanted to order something small. We ordered a cheese crisp w/guacamole to split and I ordered 1 beef taco. The cheese crisp was SUPER greasy {I know, I know, cheese crisps are normally greasy but this one seemed over the top}. The guac was super bland, literally just mashed avocado and nothing extra special. My taco was ok, but not incredible {greasy too!}. I do still love their chips and salsa. At least they're still the same as I remember!  The main reason for my 3 stars is the service. We were there during \"off\" hours, it wasn't super busy, and the room that everyone was seated in was super small but it seemed as though our waiter was ignoring us when we wanted to pay the bill. We were trying to stare him down and finally my mom starting waving her credit card at him and he STILL pretended he didn't see us! It was crazy. We waited at least 15 minutes with dirty dishes on the table and no one bringing the check.   Anywho, i'm not sure if we'll be back because there are so many fantastic Mexican restaurants in the Valley. Major bummer!",

Fast forward a few years & had some friends that swore this was the best New Mexican they'd had since moving from NM. So I gave it another shot going in not expecting Sonoran & was happy with everything I got which was a combo taco, enchilada with rice & beans. See I was still trying to hedge my bets after my first experience. The friends I was with knew to ask for the hotter salsa & I liked that too.  Next time I was visiting the area for a date night I was waiting for my room to be ready on a Friday afternoon & wandered in looking for a happy hour. They have good happy hour specials on drinks & appetizers. On this visit I had some apps & margaritas. I enjoyed the bean dip, chips & guacamole.  Went back again after these good visits & tried the happy hour again but on the outdoor patio & LOVED it. The patio was full very soon after arriving so arrive early if you want a seat on the patio. I had the happy hour house margarita, Modello Negra & Michelada all are good. If you're looking for a fancy margarita with only fresh ingredients aka not a mix skip the house margarita, They do have some other Cadillac margaritas on the menu they aren't on happy hour & those are head & shoulders above the happy hour & sooo good.  I'm looking forward to returning for another date night. One other suggestion is to know they close early on the weekends at 10 so start your night here.",

It takes at least 10 minutes to walk to the restroom if your seated in the front room and then you gotta get real lucky scoring one of one stall bathrooms to actually do what you gotta do. Moving onto the food, there are no lunch specials available, so you must select off the high priced dinner/lunch menu. Whoever is saying that this salsa is good is clearly off their rocker. It is a watery mess with nothing in the salsa. It is more like a bowl of Frank's red Hot Sauce than a True salsa experience. Chips though were tasty and seemed homemade, but doubt it now. Our lunch choices were the Chicken Mole and one of those tortilla shell salads from the 80's. Her dish was quite standard and I heard no complaints, but my mole had some issues. Smartass waiter said this wasn't a hot item and mole typically isn't, but 1/4 of the way through, this gringo started heavy sweating. Then we have the chicken which did not seem like real chicken. Plus the dish was chicken mole enchiladads, but all they did was give me two cheese enchiladas with some nasty chicken on top and then that horrible mole sauce at a price of almost 12 bucks.     Frank and Lupe's time has come and gone. How bout remodeling your cramped front room and modernizing your bathroom facilities while your at it. Scottsdale garbage.",

After knocking not one but three drinks on the ground, all three producing shards of broken Negro Modelo glass, one would think they'd send a goon squad over to whisk my Winter Beer Festival attending ass out the door, throwing me into the street like the town drunk in some old western movie.  Nope. What did they do? Instead, they bring me replacement drinks free of charge. Go figure. Like I needed any more beer, right?  I suggest ordering the #4 combination dinner. I managed to get a couple bites, (which was pretty damned tasty) but most of it wound up on my white polo shirt. Weird how white attracts large amounts of Mexican food. I looked like an art-deco work in progress.   Frank and Lupe, you have a really nice establishment.  Your food (what I can remember of it) is tasty, and your servers are super polite, but you really should have banned me for life, or at the very least, called the police on me or something.  Anyways, I'm going to do you guys a big favor and self-impose a \"Banned-for-life\" on me.  It's the least I can do to return the favor.   BTW, we were both lucky I found your receipt in my cargo shorts this morning, otherwise I'd never know the name of the place to ban myself from.",

I've had bad experiences here TWICE when using internet coupons or certificates.  The 1st time, I was told that the restaurant was no longer accepting that particular certificate.  I had just purchased those coupons about a month before.  Now, I PAID money for those certificates, but, it was a discounted amount, so I sucked it up and threw my two remaining certificates (and money) away.  Now, a week ago, I got a notice that a Deal Chicken I had purchased for F&L was expiring.  I buy a lot of online Coupons (Groupon type), and I don't remember what I bought where or if I used it or not.  I checked online, and the coupon site said my certificate was good.  So, we trotted down to Old Town for dinner and when I presented my certificate, they said it had already been used.  Apparently, they log their certificates on paper and DON'T update the websites issuing them.  We were the 3rd table that night trying to redeem a coupon that had been used before.  The manager came over and apologized, but it was really too late.  We had a bad experience for no reason, other than the owner's refusal to log coupons online as used.",

I was standing next to the concierge as they made the reservation and gave them the details. They told her it was no problem having a party that size. When we arrived, we were told there was no reservation and they \"don't even accept them\". But, they would make room. Other than our group there only about a dozen people in there anyway.  Every member of their staff was snotty and rude. When I asked to talk to the manager I was told they did not have one and there was no one in charge. (That was evident). Finally, I told them we would just leave and they told me to \"wait to talk to the manager\". After waiting ten minutes to speak with whoever was in charge, I was told by the snottiest bartender I have ever met, \"I need to go in the back\" if I wanted to speak with him. He told me they did know of the reservation and he would handle it.  So, obviously the other three people lied to me. We had 1 server and one busboy for a party of 35 and they knew the day before to add staff.  Isn't that the purpose of a reservation for a party of that size? It took almost 30 minutes to get water and drinks and place an order.  After tasting the food, I wish it had never come. Taco Bell would have been a better choice. The staff was so rude I am guessing it was intentional.  I would hope the owner reads Yelp because his restaurant is a disaster. I have this event every quarter here in Scottsdale and will never frequent this restaurant again. Plus, I will diligently alert anyone else via Social Media that Taco Bell is abetter choice for Mexican food in Scottsdale.  There are far too many choices of great restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  Frank & Lupe's is the worst restaurant experience I have had.",

Prices were reasonable especially for the higher end drinks.  The location near the art galleries makes for a perfect date night. It is also super charming inside and on the patio.  This will be my Scottsdale go to place.  Am so jealous of the locales that they get this place in their hood!",

    "text": "So, this place is just all right. My wife liked the atmosphere, but I found it to be a bit too bar-ish for my taste. The dining room is extremely small, so if you don't want to inadvertently eavesdrop on everybody in there you'd better go elsewhere. Also, the bathroom's \"outside and around the corner;\" kinda inconvenient.  The food's not too bad. The salsa served with the chips is tasty; more savory than most places. Food portions are good, and I was surprised to see my chimichanga overfilled with beef- so it's a reasonable value.  Service is \"eh.\" We were acknowledged and all our needs met, but just kinda felt like they could care less if we were there or not.  Not really sure why \"Old Mexico\" is in the title of the restaurant, though; like I said, it's a very bar-ish atmosphere playing mostly modern music and serving the general Mexican bill o' fare.  Still looking for the Mexican place that will knock my socks off in the Phoenix area.",

I was particularly impressed with the way he was supporting the staff, working side by side, in spite of being dressed in a suit.  He was clearing tables and at the same time acting as the host seating guests.  Clearly here's a guy who is proud of his restaurant and I can see why.  The kitchen did an outstanding job in spite of the pressure of a spring Saturday night crowd.  A local couple told us they eat there 3 times a week.  Great food and very reasonable prices.  Be sure to check out the patio in the back if the weather cooperates.",

    "text": "I give Frank and Lupes a solid A-OK. I go to Frank and Lupes when the patio is open which is during the peak season and before it gets too hot out. The patio is kind of like a patio in Mexico with the beach in the background. This patio might not have the beach, but it has everything else to the equation, including pitchers of margaritas and a great atmosphere for a weekend meal of decent Mexican food.  This isn't fine dining. This isn't even kind of fine dining. But this is a fun option for Mexican food and it's a couple levels nicer than a Mexican bar in town. So if you go into it with these expectations, you'll have fun.   I like Frank and Lupes for a casual night out that involves margaritas and guacamole, but especially for their soapapillas. Their soapapillas are really good. Their guac is decent but creamier rather than chunky. I prefer chunky guac but can handle this creamy one. For the entrees, everything is pretty generic Mexican food but the item that stands out most on the menu to me is the #8, the Poblano Creamy Chicken Enchiladas. It has this creamy green sauce to it and the meal definitely stands out from all the other normal Mexican food dishes.   So now I've shared my secret spot for a beach vacation to Mexico when I can't quite find myself to the beach itself.",

Rice & beans were standard and acceptable.  Margarita was good and reasonably priced for hh, though the server added salt when i asked for none.  Only negative in the experience was the heat in the enclosed patio.  They have fans and Ac but it either wasn't working or they didn't have it turned up enough.  Will be back for the food and drinks though!",

During the evening, our service was quite slow and erratic.  Our party was charged for small servings of chips and salsa, which they brought to our table before we ordered anything.  Some in our party were surprisingly charged for premium alcohol even though they ordered house/well quality.  Even worse, the salsa we were served was watery and of overall poor quality.  We had friends at another table, and they echoed the same sentiments.    I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again!!  All diners are forewarned!!",

I was not turned off by the dated decor; it's rather charming in its own funky way.  Besides, you get some of the best Mexican food at the no-frills places.  However, this food was sub par.  The salsa was watery and I could have made the enchiladas much better myself.  Also, I was less than impressed with my margaritas.  I tried two different varieties to be sure :) but that was a waste.  Absolutely nothing stood out about this place.    Where, oh where is the great Mexican food in Phoenix/Scottsdale?",

I was wanting basic tacos and/or light apps and good margaritas, like what you'd find on a happy hour menu, but the girlfriend wanted \"good mexican food\" and didn't want to try a new spot fearing she might be left disappointed. They (she and her man) advised me if I hadn't had the cheese crisp and F & L's, i hadn't yet lived. A cheese crisp was ordered and they were correct in that it is not the crappy thin tortilla with burnt cheese that i've seen in other establishments. Its almost a crust and there is a nice amount of cheese, with a lil pico, shredded lettuce and sour cream to accompany. It was fairly spicy and tasted like jalapenos had been rubbed all over it, but it was a good spicy.  Much to my dismay, there was no happy hour on the weekend.  =/  I ordered a large house margarita. It wasn't great. I looooove margaritas and this one leaves you wanting to go somewhere for a good house margarita (like Cien Agave?)  For food, i had the chicken chimichanga with both red and green sauces (no fancy taco creations here folks, just traditional mexican food.) Red is spicy! Green is almost flavorless in comparison. The rice was decent and the beans were really good. They were the one thing I finished on my plate! I should also give props to the server as he was prompt and attentive! F & L's is decent, but not my cup of tea. I'll stick to the taquerias from now on!",
