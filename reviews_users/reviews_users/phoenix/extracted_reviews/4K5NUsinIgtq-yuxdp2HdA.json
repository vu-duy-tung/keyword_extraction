The shrimp taco was fun to eat.  The black bean soup was not really a soup but a lot of black beans in a rich tasty sauce.  It was so much to eat.  I had expected more liquids and sipping on the broth but nope, not here.  There is no broth to be sipping on.  Seems to be a predominant college crowd here.  I've been here a few times.  Was unimpressed with the fish burritos the first couple of times I came.",

I went yesterday and there was a white hair in my taco, there was a huge line at the cashiers so I didn't have the time to ask for a refund , they offered to make another one 10 minutes later they had completely forgotten about it. I was sitting by the kitchen and the cooks dont even tie their hair , which most of them have long hair they completely lack hygiene, Never in my life will I set foot in this place. If you decide to disregard this review and still go. Watch closely what you will be putting in your mouth!",

    "text": "Fuzzy's just rocks. After the one in my local Albuquerque closed, we needed our fix on a recent road trip and stopped at the one in Tempe. Nom nom nom!  We went with the usual chicken tacos and the cashier recommended their special beef taco which was a good recommendation. Their chips and queso can't be beat. It's not spicy like I like it but it's full of flavor and the chips come with yummy Fuzzy's dust.   Although putting feta on tacos sounds totally weird to some people, after Fuzzy's I practically can't imagine it without. We didn't have the cashier's specialty frozen margarita which looked amazing but it was cheap and people were ordering them like crazy.   For cheap eats, good tacos and a super fun, casual atmosphere you can't beat Fuzzy's. I hope that they come back to Abq.  My faves on the menu- chicken soft tacos, chips & queso, and their fajita chicken salad. With any of those, you just can't go wrong.",

The meat wasn't anything unique.   The place is busy but it's on a college campus so I wasn't surprised. The place is nasty, though. The bathrooms are filthy, smelling like an outhouse. The stone floors aren't maintained. However it looks like I might be the only customer not drinking alcohol so that explains a lot.",

On 5/15/14 I placed an order for delivery for nachos, two chicken tacos, chips & salsa, and rice & black beans at 5:16 pm. An hour later and still no food. I called the manager and she told me the food was finished and waiting to be delivered. 45 minutes passed and finally the food arrives ( so my food was sitting for 30 minutes before being taken to be dropped off) yuck. The food arrives and the nachos are luke warm and extremely soggy. Immediately tossed in the garbage. The chips had not been seasoned like listed in the online description. The tortilla from our tacos fell apart from absorbing so much moisture and they were luke warm as well. I called back and the manager said \"sometime that happens with delivery\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? She offered no kind of apology or compensation. Just unbelievable. After tossing the rest of the food, my boyfriend and I both agreed Taco Bell would have been a tastier route instead of wasting 40 bucks on the half-assed soggy concoctions we received. Never ordering from here again. If your in the south Scottsdale/Tempe area \"El Molinos\" is a more reliable option for delivery Mexican.",

    "text": "All of these good reviews must be from employees or friends of the owner because Fuzzy's is absolutely horrible. Here is a recap of my three visits:  Visit #1: Counter staff was friendly but not very knowledgeable about the menu. I asked one person what kind of fish was in the fish taco and he said it was tempura. I told him that tempura was not a type of fish and the other person told me it was Alaskan Polack (I think she meant pollack). I then asked them if they had tried all of the tacos, looking for a recommendation. The first guy told me that he had tried all of the meat tacos, because he is a \"meat guy\". So I asked which was his favorite, to which he replied, \"definitely the shrimp\". I had one chicken taco and one pork taco and they were just o.k. The feta cheese was kind of weird on a taco, it just made it salty and the sauce tasted like sweetened Tabasco.  Visit #2:  Ordered the tempura fish taco and the grilled shrimp taco. The coating on the fish was not tempura but more like some kind of breading and it was over cooked to the point of being fish jerky. The shrimp tacos took them three attempts to make correctly; the first one was not prepared as ordered, the second one was dropped on the floor and the third one was finally prepared right but was extremely salty. That's the problem when you have college kids accustomed to eating ramen and Kraft macaroni and cheese cooking at a restaurant, they are so used to consuming large quantities of sodium that they tend to over salt everything.  Visit #3:  Since this is a new restaurant, I decided to give them one last chance to get it right.  I ordered two pork tacos and the filling in both was cold. Strike three. These people really need to get out of the restaurant business.",

The wait staff is always helpful and very friendly, especially at the bar. While you're there, get a beergarita and thank me later.   The food is incredible. I usually just stick with the tacos which are always a good choice. Simple, delicious street tacos that put some of the other, more \"high class\" Mexican food on Mill to shame. The guac is also really really good. Highly recommended.   The patio is also a great place to people watch, especially towards the later hours of the evening on a weekend night. The crowd on Mill is always a good time.   Location is also really great. Since it's on the Northern part of Mill you don't have to deal with the \"bros\" going into Cue Club or anything like that. Plenty of parking most of the time.   Definitely recommend this place for a first date or for going out with your friends. Not the best place to take a family, unless you go on a Saturday or Sunday during the day.   Yay Fuzzy's!",

I flagged down a server and asked for a glass of water in exchange so my throat would be cleared out from the beans!

The food is good and cheap, what else can a broke college student ask for?!  The hot sauce is the perfect amount of flavor and zing and the servers are always friendly.    And the cups are like souvenier cups.  It's like a goodie bag after going to a birthday party",

Not really worth any major hype or a far drive, it's a place to fill up before a night of drinking on mill. If you're going to have a first date on mill with some cute girl don't take her to fuzzy's, you'll be holding in bean farts and garlic breath all night. Not exactly a great first impression.  Food was fine, service at the cashier stand was fine, but the line cook guys at the window you pick up orders from are kind of touchy and moody, they're special snowflakes who think they're too good to help customers or answer questions...gee guys you do have it hard putting tacos into wrappers, I totally understand your stress...  attitude adjustment needed in the pickup section.",

TVs on every wall to watch whatever game is on. Tables are always wiped down, floors swept. Every few minutes they pick up the trays and drinks so the place never looks too full.

    "text": "I must have passed by this place about hundred times every time I hung out on Mill Ave; but it wasn't until Sunday two weeks ago that I finally got a chance to discover yet another eatery gem in Tempe. Since my \"great\" discovery two weeks ago, I have already been here 3 times total. That means something!   The cafeteria style fits in with the fiesta/Sun Devils theme decor of the place. You stay in line, order food, then pay. If you happen to order alcoholic beverages as well, the cash register will ID you then ask you to wait right at the counter for your beverages; before you walk away to sit down and wait for your food order no. to be called.   I came in for Taco Tuesday with an order of 3 crispy tacos: tempura fish, shredded pork and shredded beef. They are all good but my personal favorites are tempura fish and shredded pork - so flavorful and fresh with different spices and textures. The tacos are decent sized topped with queso fresco, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and ranch dressing!  Besides the delicious bites, their variety of magaritas paired with different beer is great hit, also. So far I have tried their Shocker and SunDevilrita and they are both refreshing with just enough amount of alcohol to get your buzz on. They also offer Corona on tap which I often don't see in other places.   Overall, great place to eat, drink, hang out with your pals, celebrate taco tuesdays, cinco de drinko, or any other random fiestas that your inner party-self wishes. Decent portion and value. The only reason why I gave this place a 4 instead of 5 is I feel that the place could have been a little bit cleaner and brighter.",

All the tacos had a garlic sauce, melted cheese and feta cheese +fresh lettuce and tomato. I know the feta cheese is kind of unexpected in a mex place, but it actually works perfectly- also I am a fan of saving calories!! *Lame I know...   I had the margarita and my boy had the beer. Both served in a cold glass, a BIG cold glass. The margarita had a fun taste and was not too strong, which I like. PS. I asked the bartender not to make it strong, because I was driving.   Also, everything was served with a smile and the cashier and bartender checked up on us a few times. The place looked very clean.   Happy hour margaritas are $1.00 off (around $4.50) and huge!!",

The cheerful young man working the register came over to ask how we enjoyed our meals as he was cleaning up tables (he knew we were first-timers, as he had helped us navigate the menu). When we told him the chicken enchilada was missing the chicken (lol), he realized the kitchen had made a mistake and had them box up the correct meal for us to go. Nice gesture. Not sure if I would return here again, but my college kid really enjoyed it!",

    "text": "If you are tired of the same, humdrum, Mexican food place (and let's face it, AZ has a LOT of them) I recommend trying Fuzzy's Taco Shop on Mill Avenue!  I read the previous reviews on here and couldn't be more dumbfounded with the response.    This place was: Friendly? Check. Helpful? Check. Tasty? Check.  This is a regular stop for me when I'm on Mill.  I love the food, the happy hour gives you huge cheap drinks (if you drink -- I do not, but I recognize the appeal for everyone else), the service is with a smile, and the comfortable seating  (inside and outside) really does it for me.  Their salads are amazing, tacos (soft tempura shrimp tacos are my fav) are out of this world, and their burritos are HUGE!  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients and the flavors blend well.  The one thing that I will say is that one time, I got a beef burrito that contained a lot of fatty meat.  Other than that, it's been pretty yummy.  So, please, do yourself a flavor and check this place out! :)  You won't regret it (coming from a girl who usually avoids tacos or burritos, I think that that says a lot!)  Yay! Fuzzy's! :)",

The salsa here has a very strange taste to it, unlike any other salsa I've had. They have this super hot almost tabasco style salsa as well, which is disgusting, but I'm talking about this main large bowl of traditional salsa they bring you. It is bearable, but that's it. The taste immediately always leaves me asking myself, \"Why did I come back here?\" Then I remember, the prices.  Everything is reasonably priced for a drunk college student who doesn't care about the cold food they're about to be served. Basically, everything on the plate will be cold except for the main entree, which happened to me multiple times.   The customer service given by the ladies there is always great, and the comedian / cook in the back can be pretty funny over the intercom system. Those aspects may have been five-star but overall, not enough to make up for the lousy tasting food.  Great service, good drinks, poor food.",

Nice atmosphere and everyone working is usually pretty friendly. The only compliant I would have is that the front counter girls are a bit too nice. There is no reason for the entire line to be held up so someone can call their friend (via cellphone) from the patio to bring her ID up so the other on can buy more than one beer. Send that mess to to back of the line, really.  As for the tacos: Steak, YES Fish, YES Shrimp, YES Pork, YES  That's all you need to know.",

The nachos are GIANT.  They will feed two people, and they are very generous with their toppings.  Lots of meat.  :)  ONE bad thing, why the heck are the beer glasses so damn HUGE and heavy!  Its hard to hold comfortably. I think they are the glasses for margaritas, and i get that its prolly easier/cheaper  to have a one size fits all glass, but damn.  Not a deal breaker though.

Great, easy enough. Their menu has all the basics, and the main reason to visit, SUPER CHEAP BEER!!!!   Our visit we had to wait 15 long minutes because the girl taking orders and pouring beer broke a glass into the rest of the glasses, having to cease all beer orders for what felt like forever.  I get it, shit happens, you drop stuff, but hello attitude. I even gave her a tip because I felt bad and tried to laugh it off with her, but to no avail. They never brought the beer over once it was all situated and had to hunt down someone to give us our much needed Friday fix. The food was \"eh\" - not a fan of the sauce on the shrimp tacos. Overall, I would go just to drink cheap beer - just don't make the girl behind the counter angry - then you'll never see your beer.  ***NOTE, the gal working behind the counter sent me an apology and what can I say, other than she is pretty awesome for doing that, I will come back to drown my sorrows in that pimp glass anyday!****",

    "text": "I discovered Fuzzy's in Texas (Arlington) summer '11 after graduating college. Realizing I hadn't yet hit the proverbial jackpot that everyone speaks of after you graduate, I found my way to Fuzzy'$ Taco $hop. Sooooo good and soooooo cheap!!   You'll find their slogan, \"Welcome to Your New Addiction\"  plastered over everything! Cups, t-shirts, walls, etc., and the slogan doesn't lie! My first time trying Fuzzy's I went back twice in the same week!  I was in Scottsdale visiting a friend in spring training and we LOVE Mexican food! We popped into the Tempe location which is situated near the university and the hot spots where students hang. This location is poppin' with a bar/club (Vintage) located directly above the restaurant. Very different from the family-friendly location in Agg-Town.  If I had to guess, Fuzzy's is the booty call you LOVE to have at the end of every crazy party night! I literally close my eyes and smile when biting into their tasty tacos! There's a bar inside for all my lushies, and reasonable prices to boot!! If you're looking for attentive service this isn't the place. Just order your food, pick it up when your number is called and enjoy! We ate Fuzzy's twice that weekend since I miss out on good Mexican food in DC. Solid. Delicious. Cheap.  For about $40 bucks we got 5 shrimp tempura tacos, queso, chips, and two margs! SCORE!!!     Traveling on a budget? This is your spot if there's one in your area!  LOVE the upbeat  Tempe location!",

I asked the guy to warm up the tacos and he said he couldn't take back food that's been prepared and he didn't have time to make warm ones.  I left the plate there. I went back to the register and was given a reorder which was cool.  The funny and maybe gross thing that happened later was after I had put my finger in the original taco order to see if they were warm and left it on the counter, the guy gives the order to some college kid. The nasty part is, I just had sex, before going there to eat, so this guy was eating what I had on my finger that's now in the food.  Careful what u take for free!!!",

This might be one of the better options on Mill Ave. My sis and I ordered 6 different tacos to sample, ranging from soft tortillas with shredded chicken to crunchy shells with shrimp. The tacos were tasty, although it would have been nice to add some salsa or spice to them to make the meal a tad bit more unique (salsa bar, anyone?!). We did have to wait a while for our meal but that could also be the beer talking.",

Considering the huge amount of people on Mill Ave, plus the huge amount of people at Fuzzy's, I was actually really impressed with being able to get a relatively clean table, and the service.  It wasn't perfect by any means, but their beers and drinks were green, delicious, the right price, and easy enough to get. I think inside there was table service, but we simply went up to the front or the bar when we needed our drinks; this kept things simple.  We did not eat, so I can't give an opinion on the food, but their pre-mixed margaritas and their green beers hit the spot! I'd definitely come back here to try it on a regular day.",

Like I was eating a cheeze it burrito.  The menus reads the burritos is stuffed with gauc, by stuffed they mean a small scoop that isn't noticeable and the gauc has no flavor. The food was very bland, the beer was the best part of the meal. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. This place probably gets business from the drunks students who's taste buds are layered with alcohol so they can't taste the lack of flavor.",

With that say, don't let this little shop trick you into thinking that they don't serve good food. They serve great good! I've tried nearly all their tacos and I haven't got a bad one yet. Love their chips and guac (no fuzzy dust, please). They give you a really large portion of guac and while I haven't seen them make it (or asked) I'd guess they make it fresh every day. I've yet to find better guac.  GF is a vegetarian and also loves this place.  Have ordered multiple of their frozen margaritas and they too are also delicious.  The only negative is that sometimes some downtrodden people come into the store. I personally don't care and actually kind of like it that Fuzzy's allows some of these folks to come in to get away from the heat, get a water, or eat some food. We could all have a little compassion.  The only thing that would probably stop me from going here is if I learned that they were putting drugs in their food to make me want to repeatedly come back. But then again, I guess if they did that then I'd be back there anyways, huh? LOL.",

    "text": "Fuzzys makes tacos tuesday worth it especially for all the deals. They have 5$ margaritas and 1.50 tacos. Doesn't matter if you want a veggie taco, fish taco or a pork taco they are all the same. If I had to choose my favorite it is definitely the fried fish taco.  My all time favorite dish is the bean and cheese nachos. It's super cheap and huge. Grab a few friends so you can finish it but it is absolutely delicious! Definitely worth it.  The atmosphere is usually very loud and always on the move. It can be hard to find a table especially around the evening rush. If you end up outside beware of the side by the misters. Many are broken and will just leak water all over you.   As for parking, they have abundant metered parking outside but it is often limited. So keep that in mind.  Overall, the best days for a deal are taco tuesday but be prepared for crowds and for it to be loud. Otherwise feel free to check it out whenever. It is a great staple to mill avenue.",

I'm not sure if it's because when my husband and I order, they're almost the same order and they assumed the two orders are exactly the same ? If they would double check I'm sure they would realize. Either way, good tacos and I will go back. Hopefully these little mistakes don't keep happening.",

I'm not a huge fan of their corn tortillas, but their flour tortillas and meats are quite good. Also, their infamous upside-down beer bottled margaritas are pretty satisfying. Another item on the menu that is often overlooked but worth getting, is the chips and queso - the chips are sprinkled with some sort of paprika powder... TASTY.",

    "text": "It's cheap, the margaritas are huge, they serve breakfast tacos all day (proper breakfast tacos, not Taco Bell's waffle nonsense), and you can sit on the patio with a giant drink and a plate of breakfast tacos, feeling vaguely like an expatriate who ought to be listening to Mexican radio. It's the next best thing to being in Tijuana eating barbecued iguana. (I can't swear there isn't an iguana taco -- have another 'rita and go take a look, 'kay?)  It's a \"scene\" restaurant, as most things on Mill Avenue are, so not the thing if you're feeling incapable of coping with sudden, loud noises, many of them made by inebriated undergraduates. If you go at a dead-ish time of day, it's not in-your-face loud. The staff are perky and patient while you figure out the menu for the first time, and they don't go nuts over trying to turn tables if there isn't a crowd. This is counter service -- order up front, pick up the food in the back when called -- so it's pretty low key.  The breakfast tacos are pleasant, more than life-changing. If you have a serious problem with fairly well-done scrambled eggs, ask up front to have them runnier or order something else, as these are quite well-done eggs. In the future, I would stick to variations where there's something greasy like chorizo to counter the stiffness of the eggs. These tacos are very generous -- I thought I was starving and couldn't finish a plate of two with the accompanying Latin potatoes (which are very nice) and refried beans (which are generic).  As far as Mexican restaurants of this sort -- silly name, self-conciously funky decor, waitresses in tight shirts, very large drinks, loud music, okay food -- go, this is a bargain with a nice view of the neighborhood.",

The workers are always so pleasant and funny, I feel like such a regular now. Their tacos, enchiladas, and tamales are great! Also their mex-mex rice and beans are delicious. It is a great location on Mill and when you're done eating you can walk upstairs to Vintage or across the street to the Vine, Rula Bula, or Moonshine. Parking is usually pretty easy to fine on the meters between Fuzzy's and Caffe Boa.  Also they have a reward system that gives you points every time you visit, it's the Fuzzy's app, check it out",

I walked in with my boys, the attendant was on the phone, after hanging up, he started taking our order.  He asked a question that I did not hear. He seemed to get very irritated with my question. As we kept trying to add to the order, he was more and more irritated.  I tried to end the order with a beer. He asked for my ID, which I was happy to show.  He took my ID and tried to swipe it through the machine, he must of had a problem because he tried it several times and got more forceful with the ID, to the extent he broke my driver's license.  At that point I did not want the order, nor did I want to stay in the restaurant any longer. I asked for my ID back, at which point he didn't want to give it back. I demanded my ID and walked out.   I would not recommend this place to anyone!  This place has very rude staff and obviously does not care about the customers.",

Your customers should get some kind of acknowledgement when they walk into your business. A greeting, a smile even... the cashier today seemed like he couldn't be bothered and we were put on hold for about 5 minutes when calling in our order only to walk in and see it wasn't busy. This seems to be a recent trend with their customer service in general.  I ordered 2 fajita beef burritos, one with no beans. I try to mention that this is because of a food allergy but the last few times I've ordered these they came with them anyway. If you've never eaten something you're allergic to, just know it can be very painful to digest. One of the burritos was just full of chunks of fat and what pieces of meat we did get didn't look or taste like it even touched a grill. Last time I ordered this and dined in, I asked for my burrito to be remade because of the beans and was given attitude.  Huge disappointment since this was once one of my favorite places to eat. You guys need better employees or to put them through more training.",

The tacos were pretty good, however, they ran out of shrimp so I wasn't able to try that. When we went outside, there were two open tables, but they both had dirty dishes on them.

I dare try not to test the habanero sauce.  The issue is not the food.  Service, presentation, and time to get my food is what makes this 3 stars.  Their cashiers are always slow.  And the time it takes to make 2 tacos seems like eternity.  To top it off, the portions of meat in the tacos have shrank and it seems they just through everything all over the place.

    "text": "Fuzzy's just has a special place in my heart. It was the first place I went to on Mill when I was a freshman at ASU, and I've been going back ever since!   Let's start with the food. I love their tacos more than I love some people. They put a garlic-y sauce on them, some pico, cheese, lettuce, and the tortilla's are always so fresh tasting. I usually just get the classic shredded chicken, but their breakfast tacos are amazing as usual. They also have some amazing refried beans and the guac is pretty delicious. I would recommend going on Taco Tuesday when all the tacos are just $1.50 - it gets busy, but it's worth the wait.   Now for my favorite part...the margaritas!! My favorite is the red, white, and blue beer-Rita. It's strawberry and lime marg mixed together with a blueberry beer face down in it. It's amazing. The classic sun devil one is great as well and honestly I don't think you could go wrong with any of their beer-Ritas. They're super fun!   The atmosphere is super causal and it's a great place to go before a game. It's loud and exciting and everyone always seems to be having a great time. The service is usually fast and friendly. Definitely check this place out!",

Their hot sauce definitely made them much better to me, a nice flavor and kick added.   Got a half pina colada half strawberry margarita and was very disappointed. It tasted like juice and had no buzz to it. It comes in a large glass too. You'd expect to get a bang for your buck and think you're getting a strong or somewhat strong drink but literally was like drinking a virgin strawberry pina colada and I have a fairly low tolerance so I thought about sharing it with someone to be safe but what a waste.   Not sure if I would be back. If I did come it would only be for taco Tuesday and definitely would not get a drink. Not worth the money.",

CONS: -The fish tacos were very good.  I can't say much about the chicken taco I had. -Crispy isn't what I thought it was--instead it's just a hard shell, and I'm not a fan of that. -The hot sauce is not hot enough.  FOUR STAR!!!",

I decided to go with a platter consisting of two chicken tacos, with the cilantro lime rice and the fried potatoes.  And I got the large souvenir cup (good for dollar refills on return visits).  The good:  The rice was fantastic and the potatoes were pretty good as well. The bad: The tacos were mediocre.  I liked the garlic sauce, but could have done without everything else (for the record, I'm a corn tortilla, onions and cilantro taco guy).  I would consider stopping back the next time I'm town so that I can get some more of that rice.",

The food is not great but not the worse either. More of a beach feel to the whole place. My only complaint, and it is a big one so listen up owners, is that the place was pretty dirty. I once read that you should never eat at a place that has a dirty bathroom. The bathroom was disgusting. Also the counters were very dirty. Even the creamers were left uniced and had stains on them. What's up with that? The restaurant was dead at the time we left so that did not make sense to me.",

Atmosphere was very College-esque, brightly colored and surprisingly quiet.  My food was ready moderately fast and of course the prices were excellent.    My one qualm, however, would have to be the hard seating.  It wasn't comfortable sitting for more than 10 minutes in that booth, and I constantly had to move around to keep my butt from complaining.

The employees seemed like they were having \"responsible fun\" with their positions. Enjoying their jobs while making sure they took care of their responsibilities.   If you go make sure you get one of their \"Frequent Muncher\" cards to get yourself a free shirt after 10 visits.  Overall... I have 5 punchs on my card, and I can tell you out of the 5 times I've been there, only once I was disappointed, and it was only because it was so busy.",

    "text": "Darned good tacos! I'd heard so much about Taco Tuesday at this place, I had to duck in when I found myself near there.  Holy Mackeral! 1.50 Tacos? Are you kidding me? ($1.99 normal days).  I like to honor what the place does on first trial.  I figured I'd try three tacos; one shredded beef, one shredded pork, and a fish. The souveneir cup seemed like a wise choice for 1.99, with endless refills from the fountain. I was working so no drinky drink, but the college kids seemed to be enjoying all sorts of margies with beers tipped into them and huge frosty schooners of God knows what. I'll have to go back for that.  The tacos were excellent. I probably liked the beef about the best, with the pork a close second, and there was certainly nothing wrong with the fish taco either. They are served \"Baja style\", so there's fresh tomato, lettuce, cilantro, and feta cheese, which imitates some of the hard mexican cheeses quite deliciously. I'll come back, often.  There's 8 or 12 beers on tap, including Corona which you never see. The decor is what you'd expect, multi colored swag in beer themes and school colors so you don't forget you're at ASU, should you have too many frosty margs.  I wouldn't bring the kids, though you certainly can. The music's loud, the vibe is college, and the beverages are flowing. I'm tickled to have found this place!",

This last visit, we decided on Fuzzy's, honestly because the name is so hilarious.  They were advertising a new queso jalapeno cheese covered burrito.  Best big ass chicken burrito I've ever had!  I am one that can't handle much spice, but this was perfect.  Just a tiny bit of heat from the cheese, the burrito actually had taste and was thick.  I felt I didn't have enough guacamole after I had already paid and sat down to eat.  I went to the front to pay for extra guacamole (only $1.25 compared to Amados nasty crap for over $2), but only had my debit card.  The girl that helped me said not to worry about it and used her OWN tip money to pay for it!!!  I was willing to order more sour cream or something, but she said it wasn't a problem.  I was so impressed!    Now because this is only the 2nd authentic burrito I've had since living in Phoenix, Fuzzy's is getting 5 stars.  Half way through my burrito I was full, but it tasted sooooo good, I ate the whole thing.  I felt like I needed to be rolled out of there.  There are Fuzzy's in the St. Louis area (to my St. Louis friends) so I recommend you visit, and try to tell me I'm wrong about the food!",

    "text": "I love this taco shop. You could even say I'm a little obsessed. It's cheap (tacos being about $1.99), has a relaxed atmosphere, and the tacos are bomb.  Let me clarify a few things though: Their Baja-style tacos are killer. Each one starts with a layer of Mexican blend cheese, meat (more than 2 tbsp.), lettuce, tomatoes, and feta cheese that goes all the way to the top. This is not your 1/3 full Taco Bell taco. However; their breakfast-style tacos aren't as full. They don't have the lettuce and extra cheese like the Baja ones.  Rice has good flavor but can be crunchy depending on the day. Black beans are seasoned well, but the refried ones could use a little TLC in the kitchen.  Drunken Pig soup is better than I thought it'd be- there's a lot of meat in one little bowl. Quesadillas are huge. As in cut the moon in half and there's your quesadilla. Rarely do I see people finish a whole one. But there are those who workout 24/7 and can eat a whole whale if that were legal, so they can probably down one all by themselves. For the rest of us however, you can share it and be fine.   Out of everything I've had there, the Baja-style grilled fish, chicken, and spicy pork tacos are my favorite. I like to order two tacos and a side of rice which usually keeps me full for the rest of the night. It's a definitely a place to go to if you're looking for good, cheap Mexican.",

It's honestly great for a cheap meal - the food isn't particularly outstanding, but it fills you up and it feels good going down. You can get a huge margarita or beer for about $5 (or less - I can't remember the exact price), and you have to try one of their signature beer-ritas at least once (they stick a mini bottle of Corona upside down into your margarita)! The Sun Devil beer-rita is my favorite - the mango flavor is awesome.   There's a little bit of inconsistency with how the tacos are made - I've gone some times when they've been very dry and light on toppings, other times when they've been so overflowing that I literally can't pick them up, and others when they've been just right. You can't complain too much for what you're paying. Taco Tuesday is discounted tacos - be ready to wait 10-15 minutes in line! Ample seating, though, so don't worry about getting a table.   Fuzzy's for the win!",

All of sudden all I hear.. \"I'm cravin a taco\", yeah me too, yeah me three... so here we are grabbing some tacos.   Menu is pretty straight fwd but you're thrown when you walk in knowing if it's a sit-down or order & sit. Place your order, find a spot and wait till the buzzer goes off... unless u order a drink (oh yeah, like a beer-rita or frozen margarita) then u get that from the counter next to where you ordered. Food orders are done at the opposite end of the entry and that's where you pick up.  We got a few different tacos (grilled & fried shrimp, a kids taco plate which included a side, churro and drink... not a bad price either for all that. Make sure u ask for items you want on a taco for a kid as they keep it basic... meat & cheese. Lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, etc...   The food was good and provided a variety for everyone but it didn't really knock your socks off like many other taco places in the valley. The one thing I did like was the Fuzzy seasoning added to chips. I needed a lot more of that on my food items as it had some good flavor for the chips.   The wait time can be a pain, but credit that to the menu and people being indecisive. Luckily we missed the rush, but I can see the hopes of people wanting their food quick.  I'll make my next trip during Taco Tues as they have specials that are cheap and I hear worth it.",

I understand being busy, but they had run out of both refried AND black beans, and seemed to be running out of lettuce, too. Our food took a long time to come out, and when it did, it was strewn on the plate, my friend's tortillas were literally refrigerated (just throw then on the grill, dudes!) and my other friend's taco had cheese on it, even though she asked for it without.   The saving grace of the place were the drink specials... there's absolutely nothing wrong with $2 draft beers, especially when you have a good selection. And the mangorita was delicious. So, in conclusion, you can come here to drink, but my god, that food was not good. As my friend says, \"this is what happens to taco joints when you run all your mexicans out of town.\"",

But not only is Fuzzy's one of my to go places for lunch, it is also one of my favorites after a night out on Mill Ave. Those juicy tacos really hit the spot and absorb anything in your system before heading back home. They have two registers to take the orders and the kitchen staff is pretty fast and efficient. With that crowed the occasional mix up is unavoidable, but all the great flavors you get to enjoy, really make up for it.",

My wife wasn't a fan of the Oreo dessert, however I was so don't let it stop you, and he insisted to make it right and get her set up with sopapillas instead. And today, the beer mug wasn't as cold as usual and he want again above and beyond and hand chilled one with ice and water for me and delivered it to me without me even asking. He just simply overheard me saying it was warmer than usual and showed up with a fix.  FUZZYS THIS IS YOUR MAN! Thanks Ryan!",

I got the Brisket burrito and lemme tell you the flavor was great! I just wish the brisket was a little more seasoned. I also love that this place has actual sweet tea!   The customer service was top notch and they're always speedy with taking the order and getting the food out (even when there's a rush). The owner of the restaurant was actually in when I was there and he was super accommodating plus personable!   I'll definitely be back and I can't wait for more locations to open up!",

    "text": "We had just moved into the area and after a long day of packing and moving, tacos and margaritas on a Taco Tuesday sounded great. Located right in the middle of bustling Mill Ave, Fuzzy's had a large menu and was quite full during dinner time. I tried a combination of pork and shrimp tacos along with a margarita.   Once you order your food at the counter, you'll get a buzzer to notify you when your food is ready. However, if you order a drink, that will be made and ready before you go and grab your seat. We chose to sit outside on the patio as it had cooled down from the daytime heat. The food was ready in no time and they were of ample size.   Fuzzy's is quick and easy for tasty tacos; expect a laid back yet vibrant atmosphere with a heavy college crowd.",

They serve giant MARGARITAS, delicious TACOS, and fresh CHIPS & GUAC. We always have a great time when we come in!  Fuzzy's is definitely NOT a standard restaurant. You order at the front where you pick up your drink. In the back is a second counter where you pick up your food. You can have your choice of sitting inside or outside (I suggest outside because of the ambiance from the lights).   The atmosphere is typically pretty noisy if you go in for dinner but still so much fun to hang out with friends! I got a chicken taco, my date got a chicken burrito, and we shared some chips & guac. All chips and taco shells are GLUTEN-FREE since they use corn flour! We got a frozen strawberry and a frozen screwdriver margarita to drink. They're are always SWEET but STRONG.  Fuzzy's is definitely a STAPLE on Mill that you have to check out!",

To me the food was a three but the prices for what you got and customer service were a four to me, which is why I would have liked to give it a 3 1/2.  The food here is not authentic Mexican but it is still pretty good, especially for the prices in my opinion. I came for lunch and got the two taco plate with rice and beans as the side. I enjoyed the tacos and got one brisket and one shredded chicken. My favorite was the brisket but both definitely had good flavor.  My least favorite part was the rice. Mostly because I was hoping that it would be more traditional Mexican rice. The rice I got instead was not traditional but it wasn't bad just not what I had expected. Overall they had really good customer service and even though we ordered at the counter someone came by and checked on us!  If I was looking for a decently priced meal I would definitely come again, especially to try the queso it looked yummy but I did not try it.",

Fuzzys was a huge part of my college and law school life, I ate so much Fuzzys at the University of Kansas (Rock Chalk!) that I was once their customer of the month (not my most notable accomplishment but I got some free tacos out of it so #winning, amirite?). I recently had a craving and went to the location on Mill Avenue. Confirmed: I still love Fuzzys.  Fuzzys is super affordable (hence why I ate there so much as a broke college/law student!) - so if you're looking for a quick lunchtime meal, this might be the place for you! It's Panera/Wildflower style ordering - you go to the front, place your order, choose a seat, and they buzz you when it's ready. They also have bomb (but potent) margaritas which they often have on special or happy hour. The frozen margaritas are definitely big enough to split.   It's definitely a college bar with a chill, low-key atmosphere. In my experience, it's packed on Friday and Saturday nights before (or after, depending on how late it is) students go out.   Highly recommend Fuzzys - its got a special place in my heart!",

We ordered breakfast food because it was pretty early and we weren't wanting lunch yet.   I got the chorizo and potato burrito. I was surprised to see that it came with eggs because the menu didn't say that. I have a strong suspicion that the chorizo was a pork mixture instead of beef, because the quality just was not good. They have a hot sauce on the table that is called butt burning sauce. This saved the meal for me because without it, there just was not much flavor. To their credit, we had out-of-towners with us who loved their chorizo burritos, but I'm not sure that they truly have had authentic Mexican food with where they are from.   We also ordered chips and guacamole, which ended up being my favorite part of the meal. The guacamole was nice and chunky and had great flavor to it. The chips come with some sort of salty seasoning on them that add to the taste which was a nice surprise.   Overall, it was affordable and easy. Would we come back? Probably not with all of the good places on Mill Ave.",

We had the brisket burrito and brisket nachos. The brisket was solid all around, the burrito was okay, but these nachos were fully loaded and delicious. We also had a couple of beer-ritas, which are their frozen margaritas with a beer in them. The strawberry blonde was the BEST. Everything was pretty cheap too, which is always a plus.

Whenever I go to Fuzzy's I'm always talking with friends over tacos. Personally I recommend the fahijta variants of the beef or chicken. However, the shrimp bowl and fish tacos look pretty tasty.   If your appetite is larger than usual then you can't go wrong with the nachos. A strawberry margarita balances the salty with sweet. A winning combination! Of course, everything I've ever had here has been hot and fresh. Cold tacos would be a sad time so I'm glad to get everything hot.   One of the nice things about Fuzzy's is how quick the service tends to be. Usually when a restaurant gives you a food buzzer there's reason to be scared, but I find that Fuzzy's doesn't waste time. That being said, if the place is really busy then you can expect to wait a few extra minutes but you'll still have a good time.",

The $5.25 house margarita (on the rocks) was so watered down you couldn't taste the tequila OR the margarita mix. They have tons of flavors of frozen margaritas, but we watched them pour a mango one into a large goblet glass, it sat on the bar for awhile and when no one claimed it, the girl opened up the margarita mixer and dumped the drink back in! Gross. It was busy, we waited about 20 minutes, and they were quick with the food and drinks. That's about the only good thing I can say. So many better places for tacos.",

    "text": "Fuzzy's is really nice. I think the prices are good for the amount of food you get. I did have a couple of problems with my last visit. The first was that when my shredded chicken nachos were done being made and I was paged to come get them, they were kinda cold. They're weren't sitting there long. A minute at most. And it wasn't like they were room temperature, they were cold. Like the were just taken out of a fridge. The friend I had gone with said that her rice wasn't even cooked all the way. My second and last problem was that there was a hair in my food. Normally I would excuse it as being my hair, but this time I couldn't do that. My hair is pretty much black as night and when I went, my hair was about an inch long. The hair that was in my food was obviously a brown, 2.5-3 inch long hair. I will give you guys the benefit of the doubt and continue to come but I really recommend that your cooks wear hairnets. I noticed your cooks wearing hats that they would take off periodically and wipe away their sweat, which is kinda gross. Please review what I have written and try to amend it. I am not looking for you guys to give me free food or a discount, I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.",

I'm a fan of great Mexican food and wasn't expecting top of the line fare being it is basically a taco shop, but this was horrible.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the place has a cool vibe, but it ends there.  I had a ground beef taco and a shredded beef taco.  Got both to go as I was walking home, but ate the ground beef taco there.  Yuck!  Almost went to get my money back, but they all seemed so happy about the opening I just didn't have the heart, and I figured maybe the shredded beef would be better.  WRONG.  I took a few bites as I walked down Mill and found the nearest trash can to dispose of the rest.  This is hands down the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted, and just may be one of the worst restaurants I have ever tried.  I feel bad for them, but there is no way they will last 6 months, obviously they don't care or just don't know good Mexican food.  I can't believe that this is a chain and there are more out there somewhere!   I would say to stay far away from this place, but it is so bad that it's almost worth a novelty to stop in and get ONE taco to share if you happen to be walking down Mill one evening.  You will see what I'm talking about, amazingly bad food, you will not believe they are charging money for it.",

I was seriously wanting slices but my friend Dani who I was walking with persuaded me to try out the place coz we were right next to it, and we were tipsy. So, walking in you really get that there's nothing local about this place, it's so commercial and chainish that it's disheartening with how Mill ave sold out. Anyways, saw the lackluster choices, and noticed that for breakfast burritos they were missing a basic item choice, a SAUSAGE burrito, heck that's common at every bertos drive thru, it's like a cheese quesadilla it's such a normal thing to order, WTF?! so ordered a bacon, cheese and egg burrito and waited for it to come out. Got the burrito and was dismayed with how non-hefty it was. for $4.50 i expect hefty, thick, with grease dripping, and it should be too thick to put in my mouth because it's so big BUT sadly this burrito was limp! LIMP! and it really wasn't satisfying, Del Taco's even better than this, and del taco tastes damn good when you're drunk, to the point you think it's so delicious that it's gourmet, sadly this was alright. My experience was eh, and the owner/manager dude asked how i liked it, and let's just say alcohol reveals the truth. Any chance of me coming back? never.",

There is a huge difference between tacos (or any dish really) you eat while drunk and those eaten while sober. The magic that makes a 2:30am meal taste amazing is mysteriously absent when you return with your wits about you. Herein lies the difference with Fuzzy's. I will not go into incredible detail but suffice to say that they have cured several of my usual taco pet peeves. The first thing they have done right is to put the grated cheese on the bottom so that it can melt into the meat and not just fall off. Many of the menu choices can also be had with feta cheese on top. Secondly they have gone away from the trap of \"super spicy for no reason\". Trust me that is a good sign. Ask the Creoles and they will tell you the relationship between camouflaging spicy and terrible tasting ingredients to make something edible. Instead they have chosen to used a garlic sauce that brings out the flavor of the meat rather than masking it. The final thing is that the shop owners have kept the prices very reasonable. If you go I recommend the huge iced chalice of beer.",

However, last night, while dealing with the 2am crowd, the \"manager\" Arianne almost got PHYSICAL with me and some of my friends. We were waiting on our food by the kitchen when she asked us to step back, which we did, however the five foot space was not to her liking and she began cursing and throwing f-bombs at us! No shrimp burrito is worth that. Ridiculously unprofessional. Some of the other staff came by to apologize for her behavior but maybe she should work in a non-customer service oriented field...just my opinion.",

    "text": "Finally made it down to this location and took my bf with after months of raving about this place only to be a bit disappointed. My first time trying fuzzys was at the Thomas location(which originally made me fall in love with their \"special\"-ground beef taco) which is unfortunately closed. We ordered the \"special\" ground beef tacos(nothing special), ground beef nachos, quesdilla, and brisket soft taco. The ground beef tacos were skimped on the garlic sauce which makes the taco great however the ones we had on this location were not, the nachos weren't bad as well as the quesdilla, the most horrible was the brisket taco not because the brisket itself but the presentation and assembly- the \"soft\" shell was served cold and hard and all the ingredients that go onto the taco seem as if they were just tossed from a left field. The cashier could use a crash course in how to casually dress as she was wearing daisy dukes and a smedium tank when she was clearly a large i mean i know that its college town in that particular area but at 12pm on a Saturday i went to eat not see a peep show. Overall im disappointed in this location and dont plan on visiting again anytime soon.",

    "text": "This is the first AZ location for this chain and it just opened a couple of days ago. Unfortunately, I'm left with mixed impressions about my first experience here.  It's a casual restaurant where you order at the front and then you can either eat inside or get it to-go. I went the to-go route and ordered their taco plate. Prices are pretty good, with the taco plate running around $7 for 2 tacos and your choice of 2 sides. I got the grilled fish taco and grilled shrimp taco, both in the soft option (which means you get a soft corn tortilla). For my sides I got their rice and black beans.  First off, the tacos were good. They're unique in that they use feta cheese which adds a nice saltiness. The shrimp taco was my favorite of the two -the shrimp were seasoned nicely and weren't overcooked.  Where they missed the mark though was on the sides. The rice was undercooked to the point where some of it was still hard, which completely distracted from any decent flavor it had. The beans were good flavor wise, just watery, which I don't love... but this would have still been ok except for the fact that I found a hair in my beans :(  Their hot sauce is good though and was a nice surprise. I would have loved it on my rice if the rice wasn't undercooked. The hot sauce has a tangy, almost-buffalo style quality to it, with just the right amount of heat.  Since this is only their first week being open though, I would be willing to go back and give it another try and hopefully some of the issues will have been worked out.",

Now I have been coming to Fuzzy's every Tuesday since I moved here from Ohio and use my military discount.  I'm familiar with the owner who is a Michigan fan!! He teases my son's for wearing OSU gear!!! Tyler was rude loud and obnoxious, refused to add my discount and shoved my receipt in my face and said \"Look lady I'm not giving you a discount, do you want me to get fired\" The manager was not there but Westin , I'm assuming was taking the managerial position for the day, stepped in.  He assisted us with a smile, was cordial and added my discount. Meanwhile, Tyler stomped away from the cashier station pouting! Terrible customer service...terrible example of empathy!! Tyler makes Fuzzy a place I never want to come back to!!!  Thank you Westin for all of your help and for keeping Fuzzy's onTuesday regular for us!!!",

If I go tacos, I like the grilled or tempura shrimp tacos.   The beergargaritas are my favorite part about this place, obviously. One is enough to get the job done. I've tried all of them at this point, including the one with an IPA and a shot of Jim Beam, but you can't go wrong. Boyfriend always gets the Red, White & Blue, which is a strawberry margarita with a delicious Wild Blue (8%!) blueberry beer.

Chicken, lettuce, tomato, feta, cilantro, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something. Just know 3 tacos were filling and I ordered 5. Also, their \"kick butt\" hot sauce was the just right amount of heat and flavor to compliment the taste of the chicken, loved it. The Sun Devil was delicious and refreshed my taste buds taking away the heat from the tacos with every sip. It gave me a nice slight tipsy, but then again I'm not a big drinker. Totally worth the $8. It's def a gem in Arizona and I would love to come here again. Only thing that's stopping it from 5 stars is it's not that big inside and for a restaurant I don't really get why give a buzzer to pick up your food and not just have someone serve you. I wasn't too happy with getting my drink right away, then having to leave it on the table surrounding a lot of college kids to pick up my food and return back to the table. Besides that, it was a great experience.",

I got three tacos for dinner and although they look small, in total they are a well sized meal, particularly alongside the chips and guac. I feel a lot of people probably shun this place because of how crazy it can get during happy hours, but if you can look past all the weird decorations and the rather odd name of the restaurant, you're in for a pretty good meal!",

    "text": "I come here just about every Tuesday for their amazing Taco Tuesday special. just $1.50 for all (except one) taco and it never disappoints. Lifehack: when the line is going out the doors (which is every Tuesday), go sit at the bar. You can order food from there and skip the long line.   I love their margaritas and beer-ritas which is a beer bottle upside down in a margarita. I feel like the Belle of the Ball carrying those from the counter to my table. I always get their fish tacos, both grilled and 'tempura,' and between the different cheeses, the spices in the fish, and the meaty juices it's fantastic. Don't forget about their awesome burritos too.  My one gripe is sometimes when I get tacos to go, they get messy and the tacos look like they got ran over, or a salsa/sour cream container is leaking in the bag. So I try to eat there if I can.",

First off, the staff who took our orders were so rude and you could just tell they did not want to be there.  I didn't even want to ask what the taco Tuesday special was. Then, my friend has a shellfish allergy, so he asked if they could let the cooks know.  The guy comes back and says that they cannot do that because it will take an hour to clean.  So he refunded my friend.  We waited for about 50 minutes for my order, when I go up and check, I see they made my friends order.  I told one of the cooks that they already refunded us, and he told me to just take it.   Kaylee comes over and I ask her if my order was missing.  She asks me for my ticket, but they gave a pager.  She asks about the other food on the table and then proceeded to yell at me saying that she was calling out that shellfish allergy order for awhile.  I tried to explain that we weren't listening because it was refunded and we didn't think they would make it.  She tells me that she told  the cashier guy they could accommodate the shellfish order. Okay? Well, I'm still waiting on my order, we aren't stealing $1.50 tacos.   She goes and checks with the people at the register to see if we were lying I guess?  Then to top that abuse off, she tells me they lost my ticket.  After she realises that we weren't lying she starts to be nice.  I just got my refund and left.  I didn't go out to eat to have the staff treat me like garbage.  I am sick to my stomach.",

Taco varieties are varied but you can get away with a decent meal for about $8 top to bottom, including drink and tip.   However, Fuzzy's offers deals on every angle. Come on Tuesdays and tacos are only $1.75 each. Buy a large drink and the reusable cup gets free refills forever. They occasionally have \"Dollar Taco Days\" which are as awesome as they sound.   The service is as fast as can be expected, but the place tends to get noisy at peak hours. You come to eat, not to chat. Thumbs up for Fuzzy's! See you on Tuesdays.",

I wish we had one in Arlington, VA. I might just have to become a franchisee! I loved the super casual/relaxed atmosphere. During the day family friendly and I can see it turning into a hot spot at night.   The menu has a great variety and the prices are cheap. We ordered a ton of food and it was $35. I had a grilled fish taco and a brisket taco, both on flour tortillas. I loved them both. My husband ordered chips with \"the drunk'n pig\". For our 6 year old daughter we selected nachos with cheese. My suggest is this... Put  he cheese sauce on the side. Kids love to dip and they hate soggy chips. Cut the portion in half and serve it with the carrot sticks and a churro. We also tried the Oreo churros. They came out hot and were interesting, but not something we would order again. Very sweet.   They have a full bar and several margarita and beer options. Great for the college crowd.",

That was the good part but when we got his food, one of the sides was missing. The oreo churro which was the other side, looked like two long poops on a plate and he didn't  even want to try it  2. The food looked incredibly delicious on the menu and in person but actually eating it, it tasted like it should have been made at a senior center. It was incredibly bland and I had to put a bunch of hot sauce on it just to add flavor.   3. The refried beans I honestly believe came from a can..   I'd probably come back in a year just to try it out again, hopefully it would be better next time",

The enchilada sauce that the chicken enchiladas were smothered in was alright but unfortunately, the rice was undercooked to the point of crunchy and the black beans were just plain tasteless. The taco tasted like the shell was stale and the borracho beans tasted like they were cooked pinto beans on which someone had poured beer and served. The fried potatoes were really mushy & oily and salty.  When we had walked in to get a table, all we saw were people drinking huge margaritas. Apparently they must've known what we didn't - don't bother ordering any food .. or order after having a few drinks. Each of our meals were $7.57. I could've gotten a better deal at Taco Bell.",

Waited over 25 minutes just to order!! Baja Tacos were definitely not good! The fish and shrimp tempura were overcooked and hard! Hardly no fish in the tempura batter!  And to make things worse they were cold!!'. Queso and chorizo with chips had NO taste!!  Men's bathroom needs serious cleaning and remodeling along with their AC!!! We were TOTALLY disappointed and unfortunately not the Fuzzy's we are familiar with! Most likely will not be coming back!",

I ordered the combo with shrimp enchiladas and need taco with sides of fried potatoes and borracho beans. The sauce was the enchilada was covered in was decent, but the filling was poor, particularly the shrimp. I understand you get what you pay for, but this shrimp had no flavor and a slimy texture and not even a slight outer crunch. Gross. Potatoes had good spices, but were lukewarm and not crispy. The beans tasted like beer, nothing else. Also, they were out silverware. Are you kidding me? How does a restaurant run out of silverware. The taco meat was decent, and the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, but the shell was stale. The only good thing I can say is most people were drinking margaritas, and they looked damn good. I don't recommend this place unless you're looking to get drunk or already are drunk",

Initially, we set out La Bocca for the great Yelp reviews--there were college girls handing out fliers for this place so we were sidetracked and decided to try it out.  First of all, really good vibe in there.  It's a walk up order so we placed:  fish taco plate with a side of rice and black beans, fish taco and shrimp enchilada plate and a kid's meal quesadilla.  Really bad food.  The parbroiled rice was undercooked, my pet peeve!  My hubby's soft tortilla was cold and crumbly...beyond the expired date, maybe?  The enchilada wasn't too bad.   My cutie pie's quesadilla was cold and the cheese was barely melted.  He took a couple of bites and decided he was done.  The imitation sour cream is one of the nastiest thing we've ever tasted...okay, one of.  We left with a weird film in our mouths.  They must cook their preservative laden food with  hydrogenated fats.  We're more sensitive to that since we eat organically at home.      Don't even tell me \"you get what you pay for.\"   Filiberto's has much better food and their prices are cheaper!    Eventhough they have great employees with upbeat service, it all comes down to...the food.  We'll pass on this place.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited when I saw that a new mexican food place had opened, especially one that advertises breakfast items.  I finally got a chance to try Fuzzy's today for lunch and I am sad to report, that I left disappointed and even a little horrified at how bad their food is.  Part of the reason I was initially excited about this place was the menu.  They have a pretty nice variety of food listed.  The staff at the registers is friendly and helpful enough, offering to answer any questions that we may have.  Prices are pretty decent, especially for a place located on Mill Avenue.     I ordered their taco plate with mexican rice and refried beans, while my friend ordered their enchilada plate with \"latin fried potatoes\" and borracho beans.  We topped it off with an order of chips and salsa.  We were then instructed to take our receipt to the back of the establishment, where there was a service counter.  Chips were to be picked up there, along with our order when ready.  There is quite a bit of available seating and the establishment as a whole seemed cleaned.  Between the register and the soda fountain is a display case with assorted \"Fuzzy's Taco Shop\" merchandise in it -- including a shirt that states \"If it looks like a taco and smells like fish, it must be a good meal.\"  That pretty much sets the tone for the remainder of the visit, as well as some insight into where they got their name from.  We picked up our chips, which are not freshly made, but decent enough.  They come served in a basked with some type of seasoning sprinkled over the top. Different, but not horrible.  The salsa is served warm.  Again, it tasted okay, but odd.   As we ate our chips and waited for our lunch, we were regaled with the individual running the mic at the food pick-up counter chumming it up loudly with co-workers, as well as occasionally chatting on the mic, announcing things like the current temperature.    Our food was finally ready; we picked it up and dove in.    The food is... bad.  Pre-processed, pre-packaged full-on crap.  The taco shells are no different than the type you'd buy at your local grocery store.  The \"special ground beef\" tasted chock-full of textured soy protein.  The borracho beans were analogous to cracking open a can of pinto beans, dumping them into a bowl and then mixing in some oil and thin slivers of bacon -- nasty.  The rice.  Well, it's worthy of it's own entry here.  Their rice is the kind of rice that would drive Gordon Ramsay crazy.  Best thing I can compare it to is par-boiled minute rice.  Terrible.  Spanish/mexican rice should be a keystone dish for any mexican themed food vendor. When they clearly don't even make their own rice, it's a sure sign of lazy, dis-interested ownership with no passion for food.    Ultimately, we ended up leaving a good portion of our food on the plates.  We will not be returning.  In a place like Arizona where good quality mexican food can be had for a good price all over the valley, I'll be quite surprised if this taco shop, which borrows it's name from slang for female genitalia, lasts more than six months.",

The service consistency is a crap shoot at best. I don't eat feta. It comes on all of their tacos and salads, so I always ask for \"no feta\". They get this simple request right about 60% of the time. Even though the order receipt clearly shows what I asked for. Kitchen staff clearly do not read each order as it comes through the system, instead focusing on the big picture, and missing the little details, like \"NO EFFING FETA\".  The other problem I frequently run into is the single cashier, which causes long lines. As long as things are moving forward, I'm fine with waiting a little longer. However, their demeanor is sometimes a little too friendly, encouraging conversations that slow the entire process down by 2-3 times. They have 2 registers at the front. I've seen them both used maybe once in my 12 or so visits.   If they could improve order accuracy, and speed at the register, I'd gladly  go 4 or 5 stars on this place. Yes, the tacos are that good (sans feta).",

High marks on the shredded beef burrito with black beans and cilantro lime rice...splurge and get it smothered in queso. It's on Mill ave, so stay away from Tues-Sat nights after 7 if you don't like the college crowd.",

( hey it's hard work going In and out of all those stores!) So we were walking by, and decided to check it out. First of all, the beer served In the huge margarita glasses is an awesome Idea, even though I couldn't finish it. I got the soft chicken tacos, and my parents both got the shredded beef.  They both really liked theirs, and mine were great as well. Loved the cilantro and feta! Bartender was funny and we all really liked this place! I'll be back with friends after hittin up Urban Outfitters!",

Not sure where to start with the disappointment...first off, there was not a speckle of fuzzy dust anywhere on the chips. Maybe thats just in KC but Im pretty sure the menu said they have this \"fuzzy dust.\" The queso reminded me of the nacho cheese out of the machine at a 7-Eleven gas station. No joke there was nothing in it. Just this weird nacho type cheese. The refried beans were strangely thick and oily looking/tasting. The chicken taco wasn't bad but the grilled fish taco seemed a bit odd in consistency. I don't know if the standards at this location are lower than others because its a college area or what the deal is...I will just leave it at that and probably wont go here even highly intoxicated. Taco bell would probably do the trick at that point. No go for me. I will add that the guy working there helping us was great! They have that going for them! Other than that pretty big disappointment.",

The staff are awesome, the tacos are amazing (I always get the grilled shrimp soft tacos, the sauce is absolutely tdelicious and they have some of the best shrimp tacos I have ever had), and they have an impressive selection of drinks to choose from. By far the most appealing aspect for me are the beeritas, which are basically blended margaritas with a bottle of beer mixed in for added flavor and kick. If you are looking for a new taco shop to check out, or a more laid back place to have a few drinks on Mill Ave, then this place is definitely worth checking out.",

But if you want real ingredients in your taco, this IS the place to get them. Shredded beef, ground beef, grilled fish or shrimp or tempura style fish or shrimp(my favorite!) As mentioned in the beginning, GO ON TACO TUESDAY!! Best deal for the best taco's around.   These other reviews don't know real mexican food unless they've been to Mexico City in Mexico and eaten there. It's not the same food from Mexico City to Arizona food or any where else for that matter. Don't be comparing food from different regions, just isn't the same, duh!  Sure they have food other than taco's, BUT YOU JUST WALKED INTO A TACO SHOP!!! Why are you ordering something other than a taco in a taco shop, just doesn't make sense 0.o Definitely recommended this place to everyone I know!!!",

Couple sides to choose from but i went with refried beans and mex rice. I asked for 2 flour tortillas on the side and believe it or not there was no additional charge, which i probably shouldnt mention because now they'll start charging because everyone will ask for them. The restaurant itself isn't exactly clean, the place has a high turn over as far as customers and very little staff to clean up the tables, plus its on Mill ave which is close to the college so that explains alot. The restaurant layout is you walk in order at a counter, sit and wait for your number to be called, go pickup at a window in the back.  Not confusing to me but saw several people walk back up front to the register for their food. The quality was good for the money, and food had plenty of flavor and spice and if your not a soda drinker you can get a combo w no drink for about $7+ tax. They also have breakfast tacos which sounded excellent. Beer is also available.",

We also ordered chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and the salsa came out hot - like heat hot.  I've never had salsa served this way and I thought it was good.  Both of my tacos were tasty and I liked the garlic sauce they added to the mix.  The only thing I would change is that the place could be a little more clean.  Also, I wish I would have ordered a Dos Equis because it came in a giant cold margarita type glass.  It made my beer seem sad.",

The menu and ingredients were the same, but the somehow the execution was just off.  I had my usual order with a shredded pork soft taco, shrimp tempura soft taco, and a corizo/egg/cheese breakfast taco.  The main ingredients, pork, shrimp, and chorizo and egg were as I remembered, cooked just right and very flavorful.  That's where the similarity ends, the fresh tortillas I remember were either leftovers or have been replaced with mass produced.  The toppings that should be a perfect mix of lettuce, feta, cilantro, sauce, etc. were reduced to 99% lettuce and added nothing to the tacos.  The second star is earned only for the fact that the hot sauce hasn't changed, (it's fantastic but I should have bought a bottle so I wouldn't have to go back there again) and it appeared they still serve beer in the frosted goblet (although it was lunchtime and I had to go back to work so I did not partake).  I hope this is just growing pains for the franchise and that they can bring this place up to the standards of the DFW locations.",
