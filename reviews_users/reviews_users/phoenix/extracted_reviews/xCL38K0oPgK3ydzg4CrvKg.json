I got it with the chorizo dog which was tasty - nothing like greasy Mexican chorizo. We also tried the chili dog with a beef hot dog and the hot dog/fry basket. The fries were another big hit. The only mutual complaint was that $6-7 for a hot dog plus fries and a drink is a $10 meal that may still leave you hungry. Nevertheless, it's something worth trying.",

We bought two different ones intending to share and get a taste of the menu, as this was our first time there. I thought the Columbian dog was okay, but the Paisita really had depth of flavor, was satisfying, and super tasty. My boyfriend said he liked the Columbian best, my recommendation is to read the ingredients and go with which one sounds the most tasty to you! Next time I'm here I'll probably just get the Paisita, though I want to try the Wunderhund, Sonoran cousin, and Mushroom dogs next time. We also split  vegan chili cheese fries which were yummy and a couple of their desert cookies, which were also good. They earn 4 stars from me because they are clean, offer very friendly service, and I like that the menu keeps you curiously wanting to try more.",

They had food that tasted good and was allergy friendly thanks to their vegan options.   I have been watching this place get all the love from the vegan community online and have been meaning to try it out again with all of the new vegan options they have since added and today was that day. Ordered the vegan chili cheese fries. Something I have obviously not had since being diagnosed several years ago with an extreme reaction to cheese as well as red beans and eggs.  After waiting only 1/2 hour thanks to door dash I received my order which was still crunchy, still creamy and holy mother of vegan food: still freaking delicious.  I did not know that chili cheese fries, after swearing off cheese and red beans, was possible but it is. It so is. Here at Simon's.  If you have not tasted the liquid gold and tasty vegan chili atop still crunchy delicious fries yet, what are you waiting for?   I had to restrain myself from licking the container they came in. No joke.",

It was phenomenal (thank goodness for spell check) and had a perfect balance of sweet, salty and texture. I got the beef hot dog but they have a vegan and pork sausage to choose from as well. Best actual hot dog flavor I ever experienced. Not overly seasoned or a weird tough casing...it was just pure hot dog paradise!  Next time I'll get some fries, they look great!

It sucks that it's pricier than in Miami but it's apples and oranges, there's just more Colombian joints in South Florida than here.

You would think a latin resto situated next to a nightclub that serves a night out drinking food (hot dogs) would stay open late on Fridays and Saturdays. Sadly they do not, and when I have a craving of Simon's hot dog, I have no alternative but Los Betos. Eh at least a burrito still stuffs me. ;P",

I met the owner Felipe who was gracious and kind, he explained the menu options that are available on the menu. This location is perfect because they have a parking lot so no worries about looking for a meter or space. They offer a unique twist to the hot dog and because of the plant based options available I will definitely be a repeat customer.",

    "text": "Very well done.    I wanted something different for lunch and I found it. Then I ordered something traditional. Simon's Hot Dogs has lived up to expectations. The restaurant was clean, nicely decorated without going over the top, and easy to find with parking right at the door behind the building. The owner was at the counter helping another couple when i walked in and greeted me right way. After paying with my credit card, he called me by name for the rest of my stay. That's personal service.    Even though Simon's is known for their Columbian Dog (with mozzarella, pineapple, crushed potato chips and sauce) I ordered the traditional bratwurst. This brat exceeded many I have had in midwestern German towns, including some in Wisconsin. It was well seasoned, had a delightful snap when bitten, and was fully cooked with nice caramelization but not charred. It had a generous stripe of brown mustard that complimented the flavor of the sausage without covering it up. Plenty of hot (steamed?) sauerkraut was heaped on top and it was served in a steamed roll.     Who steams their brat rolls? I have never had a brat on a steamed roll. I've had many hotdogs on steamed rolls but I can't recall having a brat that way. Now what I need to ask is why does no one else steam their brat rolls?    The french fries were simple, crispy, and served hot and fresh.     The price seems a little high for a hotdog (5.95) or a brat (6.95) but they have both vegetarian and vegan options. You do receive a 1/4 pound dog for the money with plenty of toppings. Add 2.99 for fries and a drink and you get a meal for under 10 bucks. You will walk out satisfied. If you are wanting to slam a bunch of chili dogs this isn't the place. If you want to enjoy a hotdog or brat that lives up to it's potential, stop in.  Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff) -Hotdogs and brats done in an unique way. -Clean and comfortable. (fantastic booth seats) -Surprisingly good value. -Owner takes pride in this business. -Great flavor and nicely sized portions.  Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff) -the medium fountain drink is the size of most smalls, but for dine in you can refill it. Canned soft drinks are way over priced.",

It has fried seaweed (I think fried) onions and wasabi mayo. Very unusually but delicious. The Vegas hotdog is Tofurky and grilled so it tastes so good.   If unsure what to order, ask the owner! Super nice and truly loves what he does!",

Everything from the bun, to the hot dog, to the toppings and the batter they use on the fries was delicious. Not only was the food incredible but the staff were so friendly and welcoming. They even came outside and asked if I was enjoying everything while I was still eating (which I wasn't expecting from a hot dog place). Prices are perfect. I will be returning very soon.",

Beyond that, I have been a hot dog lover for as long as I can remember, having had them in most US states and in several other countries, and I rank Simon's among the most unique and best. Period.   Their specialties are all beef hot dogs, pork bratwurst, and vegetarian/vegan hot dogs with some truly unique and delicious toppings. For example, I ordered the Columbian hot dog which comes with pineapple, mozzarella, Simon's sauce, and crushed potato chips. WOW! It was incredibly good.  Simon's has been open for less than two months, but I predict it will be like a beehive very soon. In my book it is among the very best hot dog establishments anywhere. The manager is Felipe Roldan, a gem of a guy. Just go and see for yourself!",

    "text": "I have had pinks in Los Angeles before and this place is KILLING it. It's located in a plaza next to the Hyatt place and is adjacent to that club Paris. When you walk in there are booths and a fridge filled with fruit drinks and pop. You can also get a beer there as well, this would be the PERFECT late night spot for after when the clubs and bars close in old town but I don't think they are open that late. The Colombian woman who is the cashier is extremely nice and from Medellin which is cool and authentic, and the service is amazing here; but the star of this place is the food and in particular the Colombian hot dog. It's a hot dog with some kind of sauce, pineapple and crushed chips on top, and even if it doesn't sound appetizing to you I would highly recommend it because the flavor mix is unlike anything I have ever had and I have been to Colombia!! I think the secret is the chips on top because it gives a perfect crunch to the bun and hot dog. I will make sure to stop by here next time I am in town to get another Colombian dog.",

    "text": "So happy Simon's has moved to Scottsdale! This was one of our favorite places to go in Sedona and now when we are craving a hot dog we can get one here in the valley.   I've only had the Columbian because once you try it, you will highly doubt any other dog can compete. The beef hot dog, with the sauce, and the pineapple (yes) and potato chips (yes!) somehow make the best flavor combination. I guess it's that salty/sweet magic happening. And it doesn't hurt that the bun is the freshest, softest bun ever. Seriously I want to use it as a pillow it's so fluffy soft.  We've already been twice since they opened. My waistline may hate me for visiting regularly, but my tastebuds overrule on this decision.",

The types of hot dogs they have here are insane but very good. My favorite is the cowboy. I definitely recommend this place if you are in the area and wanting to try something new.

The taste was what I expected and full of flavor. There wasn't as much spice as I would've thought with the jalepenos but that was fine. Large dining area in addition to the patio seating which was a plus.   The service was great and we had great recommendations from the associate working. If I ever am in the mood for good hot dogs I'll be sure to visit again.",

It's a cozy restaurant and I immediately noticed how chill it was.   There were only two people ordering ahead of us which gave us some time to peruse their menu. Though small, there is variety and vegan dogs, the sole reason I wanted to come here. The folks at the counter were super welcoming and friendly and even called us by name, which I felt was superb customer service. I ordered the traditional Colombian and added jalapenos for a kick. I had a choice of the California vegan dog or a tofurkey vegan dog and I chose the former. I made it into a combo for $3 more and got fries and a drink.  We forgot to tell them our order was to go, but they were great about changing how they packaged our orders so that we could take them with us. Once we got back to our destination and dived into our dogs, we all agreed that they were delicious and the fries were good as well. I loved their soft bun and the mix of sweet and savory with the hot dog, pineapples, Simon sauce, mozzarella cheese, jalapenos and crushed chips. Others tried the Hola Amigo and enjoyed that as well.  Love to support a small business, especially one run by such dedicated people. I will be back to try additional menu items like the Hola Amigo and the sides like chili cheese fries and salchipapas.",

The toppings on the dogs worked well together with the dog and soft roll. The salchipapas and patacones were very tasty with the sausage and sauce. The maicitos were OMG!

Texture and flavor are spot on. So many great styles to pick from. Love the crushed chips on them.  The best part are the little cookies. Pricey at 3 for 5.  But worth every cent.  I have to get 6 so that there is an even number to split between myself and my daughter.   Love this little local mom and pop shop. They are warm and friendly.

As a Colombian, I had been looking for Colombian fast food in the U.S. but couldn't find any restaurants serving it. The food was delicious! I got the Colombian Hot Dog with Salchipapas and a Colombian soda. As a huge fan of the fast food in my country, this food brought me so many memories about my life in Colombia. I got Colombiana, Popular, Manzana Postobon, Naranja Postobon, Uva Postobon, and Pina Postobon sodas. I also got Alfajores for dessert. The service was great and fast. The owners Felipe and Marcela were very friendly, helpful, and the only Colombians I had seen in a very long time, which made me very happy. You must try Simon's if you are Colombian and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for great fast food.",

The \"Colombian\" is a must try and it's easy to see why that's their best seller. Columbian soda is a nice bonus to the meal. Great hotdog place, probably my favorite in the valley.",

The location may have changed, but the hot dogs that we love remain delicious.   They still offer vegan and vegetarian hot dog options. Don't worry carnivores, they have hot dogs for you too. I got the Colombian, vegan style, which is a vegan hot dog topped with pineapples, crushed potato chips, Simon's sauce, and vegan shredded cheese (the latter of which I omitted). The combination may sound strange but once you've tried it you'll be a fan! The buns are different (I think they had to change hot dog bun vendors after the relocation), but they're still good, just not as soft as the original buns.   The menu has expanded too. Vegan ceviche and vegan salcipapas will be offered! (Note that some things may not be available during the soft opening.) They offer a combo; you can add crispy french fries and a drink for just $3 more.   Prices remain reasonable and the owners are complete sweethearts. You'll feel like family here.    The new location is nestled in Old Town Scottsdale, next door to the Hyatt Place hotel. As of Thursday, 03Dec, they are in a soft opening status from 11am-8pm, everyday except Sunday (although they will close at 5pm on Friday, 04Dec, for a special event), as they train their staff. The grand opening will be Saturday, 12Dec, starting at 11am.",

I tend to go for a bottled beverage here. Decor is functional and well kept.  If you're in town, it's a great place, come on in!",

Kinda hard to mess up a hot dog, but ever you ever been to wienerschnitzel, you know corporate America has done it. This place brings back the great tasty ol' hot dogs with some unique flavors to it, plus it's not expensive. I don't always give a five star, but when I do, it's because it's a bomb ass place and I enjoyed my food. I will try again and hope my experience was great as it was the first time.",

Meat hotdogs are so greasy, but the vegan hotdog was so yummy.  No greasiness, no cruelty, and absolutely delicious.  I tried the Colombian and the Wunderhund hotdog, both with the vegan California dog.  Both were excellent, however I think I favor the Colombian!  Overall, great food and reasonable pricing.  I'll be stopping here when I'm in Phoenix for work.  Wish we had Simon's up in Northern Arizona!",

My Colombian was delicious and I was glad I got it. I also ordered the chili cheese fries which they also have a vegetarian option but I stuck with the beef.   Both my friends liked their hotdogs too, making us happy we chose this place for lunch:-)  Simon the owner was also very nice and polite. Interior decor pretty neat with booth seating that look like it came from a car:-)",

First you choose what kind of hot dog you want, beef, pork or vegan. There's a variety of styles you can get.  I got the Cowboy which was basically a chili cheese dog.  It was really good, and exactly what I was looking for.  Not overly-filling but gave you enough of a base before weekend shenanigans.    The owner came by and talked to us as he was cleaning up a table and asked how we like the food.  He was very nice and talked about the business and their different hot dogs.  They were celebrating their two year anniversary at this location, but has been business for a lot longer.",

The chili was a little sweet cuz it's a Colombian chili. The cheese was good but I really like the fries. They had a nice season to them and they were nice and crunchy. They didn't get soggy cuz it took me a minute to eat them going back and forth between the hot dog and the french fries. I am definitely do to get a fix of those chili cheese fries and this time I must try the chili cheese hot dog. If you definitely in the hot dog this is a place for you",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I stumbled upon this little gem while doing my vegan restaurant hunting spree awhile back. I bookmarked it but put it on the back burner because hot dogs are not my all time favorite meal and I wanted to try others places first. Boy why did I wait so long to try this place out! First off it wasn't hard to find at all, it is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, but it is kind of hidden off on a back street (which I think is sad because so many people are missing out on it!) I unknowingly arrived less than 25 minutes before they closed, but it was a treacherous journey there so I decided to still go ahead and try it out.   To my surprise I was walking into a Colombian inspired hot dog place! I didn't really know what to expect because I've never tried Colombian food before (a hot dog at that) so my expectations were unsure at the moment. I walked in thinking that I would get the death stare by the employees because I arrived just before closing lol, but I saw a party of 4 already eating inside so I had a slight sigh of relief. As I approached the front to order I glanced at the menu and a gentleman greeted me with the nicest smile and hello and with the cutest accent, l believe he might've been the owner. At that moment it gave me a good feeling about the atmosphere of the place. He shattered my judgement of being an antsy employee who just wanted to rush all of the customers out before closing.   Fast forward, I already knew about the vegan options, so I ordered the Colombian style hot dog with vegan chili fries and added avocado (additional $0.75). The price is very reasonable and especially for the vegan option, you definitely get what you pay for! The size of the place is small, but cozy and has some cool car seat booths! In the background was Latino music playing (I'm assuming Colombian) so that kind of set the tone. It took about 10 minutes for my food to be ready, the same cashier delivered my food with once again, a smile on his face. To be honest I was kind of skeptical because of the toppings on the hot dog. It had pineapple, mozzarella cheese (vegan), crushed potato chips, and Simon sauce (some type of special sauce).   Once I tried it.......Oh.My.Goodness! The sweet and savory thing is something that I have always loved and this took it to the next level! The toppings are such an odd combination that I (or most people at that) would never think about but I loved every single thing about it! The vegan hot dog itself was so flavorful, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between it and a regular dog! It was slightly spicy to add more flavor, which I did not mind at all. The vegan chili fries were also to die for, I think adding the avocado gave it a bit better flavor too. I usually never finish a whole meal at a restaurant but I finished every single thing on my plate! Myself and the party or 4 were still there even past closing time but the employees never made us feel rushed. I love the concept of this place because you have the best of both worlds; non vegans AND vegans can enjoy this place equally! Will definitely be coming back for my next cheat meal lol.",

My boyfriend had The Columbian and it had beef and pineapples and potato chip crumbs and he was in love with it!!! I had the Wonder Dog with a California Dog and it was really hard to understand that the hotdog wasn't really meat. It tasted soooo good, the buns were so soft and perfect and both of our toppings, mine being dill pickles, onions, mustard, poblano peppers all in a homemade relish, were perfect. I didn't know how close this place was to my work so they definitely have a constant face to see, but i'm definitely writing this review for any Vegans/Vegetarians in the area, it's hard to find good food made with love especially if your friends want to eat meat as well, but I promise you this place is the place. pluuuuuuuuusssss it's cheap, you better be reading this review in the restaurant or else you're really missing out.",

The 2nd time I went to Simon's I was not super hungry and just ordered a plain hotdog with ketchup and mustard. The bun alone is just amazing. I am getting hungry thinking about it. The quality of the hotdog meat is very obviously good quality. I love this addition to old town scottsdale!",

I wish I could give it more than 5 stars for those two particular items. We also loved their fries. We tried their Mac n cheese wasn't a fan. The cheese had a slight hue of green.

The owner happened to be the one who helped me (or at least that's the impression I got) and he was incredibly friendly and helpful. I ordered the Hola Amigo, and every bite was True bliss!  My only suggestion would be either better buns or make a selection of buns. The ones they have are those fluffy wonder-bread style ones that you can squeeze into a marble-sized ball.  Nonetheless, the toppings were delightful, the dog was high quality and perfectly cooked, the fries were delicious, and the owner even chatted with me a bit during my meal and was very friendly. I'll definitely be back!",

(obviously it is not a chicago dog tho)   the flavor profile hits you from all angles. got that creaminess from the cheese, sweetness from the pineapple, salty crunch for the chips, meaty savoriness from the dog, and great buns to soak that whole taste mixture up.  also, you can tell these are good hot dogs from the bite the casing gives. dayum, i gotta go back today. writing this review is making me salivate.   also, they have some really cool colombian sodas that i was feeling. try it!  my one qualm is that this place closes at 8. after many nights out in old town, a hot dog would have been the perfect late night snack. so sad :(  i think you should stay open till at least 2am, simon  besides that you are perfect",

He single-handedly took them from a peanuts and popcorn industrial beer joint to a destination Brewery with his South American/USA combination of vegan/beef and pork hot dogs and sausages. At his peak in Sedona, he moved his operation to Scottsdale.  We live in Phoenix and have wanted to visit Felipe in his new venue. What we found...was a delight! Felipe continues to expand his list of culinary delights. You will never enjoy a better hot dog or sausage. I had the Chorizo Colombian: a Chorizo sausage on a fresh bun topped with a cheese sauce, pineapple and crushed potato chips. Capped with an ice cold Orange Ave Wit from the Coronado Brewery and I enjoyed a perfect meal. As did the rest of my family.  We will be back...again...and again...and again. Buon appetito!",

I liked that the hot dog bun actually stays together the whole way through which is not necessarily True with other places and the sauce that they put on there is just awesome.  The people working here are very friendly and came to ask me a few times how everything was. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a good hot dog in the area to come by here. The hot dogs are really great and the prices are reasonable. I'm not even sure what took me so long to try it, probably because I didn't think hot dogs would be that good!",

I have also tried the alfajores (butter cookies with dulce de leche in the middle) both vegan and regular, which I usually get the 3 for $5 because it is a good deal and I always want more than one cookie (it is hard to share, so get your own :P).  I have tried the Paisita hot dog, which is a meal in itself, and the Colombian.  I have never ever been disappointed with their food.  The service is great!  They are friendly an attentive.  The only thing, which is not a bad thing, is that you might need to wait for your meal, especially during busy times, but you know that good things take time, so be patient and you'll be handsomely rewarded with a delicious meal!

    "text": "Is it possible for a 5 star rated Yelp spot to be UNDERrated?  I mean, let me just say it right now.  This is easily the best hot dog spot in the valley.  American hot dog traditionalists will almost surely debate me on this and those who only dress their dog in one of three ingredients might not be open to something this bold.  But in my universe, owners Felipe and Marcela Roldan have created something that takes the humble hot dog to galactic new heights of flavor, complexity, and fun.  I've had Simon's on my radar for awhile.  On a Saturday at lunch, I made the drive.  On the west side of Drinkwater Blvd just north of 3rd Avenue in Scottsdale, you'll find a relatively small hot dog joint with seating for perhaps 30 or so inside and another dozen or so outside.  Simon's distinguishes itself as a decidedly Columbian themed hot dog spot as the owners themselves are Columbian (and thus why you'll hear Columbian tunes in the background).  Its a good idea to study up on the menu in advance to explore the different flavor combinations.  To be clear, you could get a traditional American hot dog here if you wanted to. But why on Earth would do such a thing?.  Not when there's so many other amazing sausage and toppings options.  The real challenge here is deciding which combos to settle on.  Fortunately Marcela herself was manning the register up front and happily offered me some tips.  I wanted to stick to the Columbian theme here and order Columbian specific items on the menu for my first go around.  Marcela recommended two options for this.  The Columbian Chorizo dog with Columbian toppings, or the Beef hot dog with Paisita toppings.  Columbian toppings include pineapple, cheese, crushed potato chips, and their house made sauce.  Paisita toppings include coleslaw, mustard, pineapple sauce, crushed potato chips and their house made sauce.  If you know me at all, you won't be surprised in the least that I chose both.  For my side, I elected their regular Patacones.  Four fried green plantains (also known as Tostones), served with Guacamole and Hogao (basically a mix of refried tomatoes and onions).  For my dessert finisher, an Alfajor (two butter cookies with dulce de leche in middle and powdered sugar on top).  And to wash all this goodness down?  A pineapple soda from Postobon (made in Medellin, Columbia).  Total cost for everything including tax?  A very reasonable $25.  The pineapple soda was a deliciously tart treat to wake up my taste buds while I waited for my food, which came out about 5 minutes later.  Once the food spread arrived, I was more than ready to get to work.  First, the Columbian Chorizo dog with Columbian toppings.  An absolute marvel.  The chorizo dog has a great snap with just the right amount of spice.  The fruity pineapple and crunch of the crushed chips add additional textures and the house sauce tastes like a slightly sweeter version of a thousand island.  It all works beautifully.  I could eat a hundred of these.  But let's move onto the Beef dog with Paisita toppings.  I was tempted to go with the chorizo dog with these toppings as well, but Marcela was right.  The beef works better with the mustard and coleslaw than the chorizo dog would have and you still get the crunch of the chips and that great house made sauce.  Two absolutely spectacular hot dogs.  The Patacones were perfectly fried with crunchy and chewy notes.  I recommend putting layers of both guac and the Hogao on these for the full experience.  Alone these two toppings are average.  Together, they're well above average.  Lastly, the Alfajor.  The cookies were crispy and buttery just as I'd expected, and that warm layer of dulce de leche in the middle gave it that mellow but savory sweetness.  As good as any alfajor I've had.  The final verdict?  A grand slam.  My mouth is still buzzing from all the incredible flavors I sampled today.  I seriously couldn't wait to write this review out of pure excitement.  Simon's actually offers catering as well and that's something I'm seriously considering for my office at some point.  And needless to say I'll be making Simon's a regular stop when I'm in the Scottsdale area (especially during Spring Training).  It wouldn't seem possible to feel or convey this much admiration and appreciation for a joint serving the humble hot dog.  Simon's location is certainly humble, but their menu is anything but.  Leave it to the Columbians to show us what many of us never thought possible in a hot dog.  Now that I know, my attitude about hot dogs will never the same.  Thanks Marcela!",

    "text": "UUUUUUUUMMMMMMM YES PLEASE!!!! This place was EVERYTHING! Okay as y'all know ya girl don't eat the meats... but when I did I LOVED hot dogs! So I say this as a suggestion a month or two ago and thought when I have some free time I'm stopping by! So glad I did... nothing to fancy about the outside, and the menu is short and sweet. I was kindly greeted when I walked in and handed a menu. I decided I didn't know what I wanted so I just took one for the yelp of if and ordered ALL the things I wanted! I got a Columbian burger, German Loka and mac n cheese!!! I have been trying to tell people when you replace the meat as long as you have good sides and condiments and you wont even miss it. this was a prime example!!!  when I tell you the coleslaw on this burger what on point I mean I could buy it in tubs and pass it off as my own! When I bit into the burger I was surprised because it was crispy but then a soft smooth in side well seasoned and well cooked like YUMTASTIC! There was a Simon's and pineapple sauce on it plus a little mustard.... like it was BOMB! the bun was fresh and held up well to the sauces with out getting soggy nothing worse then a soggy bun!! Being from the Midwest I'm not stranger to kraut (sauerkraut)  or spicy mustard so the German reminded me of home a place that frowns upon ketchup on dogs! The mac n cheese was a really good vegan alternative...I'm personally vegetarian so I'm down with milk, butter and REAL CHEESE this one has a good flavor but uses nutritional yeast which has a \"nutty cheese like flavor\" so they say!!!! I warmed it up the next day and the texture was a little grainy but it was still just as good! ALL IN ALL IT A YES FROM ME!",

Everyone should try the Tokyo Madness at least once: it really does taste like sushi and even though that might not be your thing mad respect to a kitchen that can make it work!  The Paisita just works.  The combination of the salty chips with sweet pineapple and savory cheese is fulfilling!  Thanks SImon's for expanding my food world!",

The wife and I went in on the night before they had there Grand Opening and met the owner Felipe who was extremely courteous and knowledgeable about his great product. They have several choices of hot dogs and Brats.....cooked on the grill & covered with a bounty of toppings of your choice. Now for your beef and veggie lovers they have hot dogs and brats for you to.....but since I am VEGAN this place is a GOD send for me.  I had the LOKA BRAT which comes with Spicy Mustard.....Mayo....Jalapenos.....and Sauerkraut. SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD.......WOHOOOOO!!!!! I can't wait to try the other dogs and brats on the menu and I know the customer service will be top notch. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!",

Well, the BEAUTIFUL and decadent Dulce de Leche filled cookies made it all the way to SFO without as much as a crack or crumble! Please try thus place!

I went with a beef Colombian which was topped with pineapple, mozzarella, their special sauce and finely crushed potato chips to give it some crunch.  It was pretty tasty and I wouldn't hesitate to have it again although some of the other styles of hot dogs looked interesting as well.  For an extra $2.99 you get fries and a soda with their combo deal.  I went with a beer instead and they offer a couple Oak Creek and Coronado Brewing beers which was a pleasant surprise.  The decor is pretty sterile and plain and when I was there it smelled strongly of cleaning solution which wasn't very appetizing.",

The country. Simon's Hot Dogs has the most awesome dog in the valley. You read it here first. How good is it? Well, when he used to be in Sedona. We would ALWAYS make a stop. I mean a mandatory stop, like rain, snow, or shine.. Now that he is the valley? Shoot... you guys have no excuse.   Service: We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner. They are a small family run joint and they are very hospitable. We've eaten at  Simons before and always have been treated warmly and like a regular (which we kinda were back when they were in Sedona).  Food: Ive eaten alot of hot dogs. This place might be the BEST place in AZ. It's different from  other hot dogs you have tried. Potato chips, pineapple on a hot dog? yup.  Thats that Columbia style. The pink Sauce is super yummy. He also has other yummy dogs (we like the Tokyo dog). Did I mention his dogs can be vegetarian and I believe are gluten free (you hipsters rejoice!).   Atmosphere: Small family spot. Local stuff on the walls. nothing too fancy.   I dont know why or how this combination of ingredients work together like some operatic symphony. Perhaps Simon stole this recipe from the Ancient Greek Titans and passed down to humanity ala Prometheus stealing fire (okay, maybe not stole. But goodness gracious. will you go get one already??) All I know this is ONE UNIQUE AWESOME HOT DOG.",

    "text": "5 stars hands down!!!  We got the Colombian dog and the Chili dog combos with a side of potato salad (EVERYTHING VEGAN) for dessert we finished with the vegan butter cookies filled with coconut milk dulce de leche.   THE HOT DOGS:  We loved that they had 2 different vegan dog options. One was the \"California tofurky\" which tasted as close to an original hot dog as possible. The second was the \"Italian tofurky\" which was a blend of spices and peppers. We opted for the CALIFORNIA on both and it was phenomenal.  The Colombian dog is the best seller so obviously we had to try it. The Simon's sauce was tangy but smooth, in addition, the potato chips crumbled on top added necessary crunch! Not to mention the freakin pineapple was juicy and sweet. Perfect blend of flavors.  Overall this dog gets a 8/10  The Chili dog was made with vegan chili and vegan mozzarella. The flavor of the chili was great, but I would have loved if there were beans to add more texture. Personally, I would have also melted the cheese onto the chili.  Overall this dog gets a 6/10  SIDES & DESSERT:  The vegan potato salad tasted amazing and the potatoes were the perfect firm/soft ratio.   If you're going to come here for a dog, you might as well get the butter cookies as well.  1 for $2 3 for $5  These were so so light, fluffy and fell apart in my mouth. I'm a big fan of the coconut milk dulce de leche. I love the creaminess and caramel flavors. Will definitely get this again. The owner also told us that the cookies go perfectly with a cup of coffee so we took a cookie home to try it out!  All of our food was $30 which is pretty fair. Next time we will opt out of the combo and just stick with the dogs and side of potato salad. That will be closer to ($15) and more affordable for us to consistently come back (lol)   OVERALL: we were very pleased by the cleanliness of the place and available options for EVERYONE made me feel welcome (I don't eat meat so this was a relief!) we will be going back very soon to try out hopefully all of the dogs on the menu!!",

Maicitos $5.95: This has sweet corn, but even with the cheeses it was still very, very sweet. Dipping chips added some salty contrast, but I do wish it was more savory.   *****  My Star Ratings:  1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.  2 Stars - Meh.

He is a picky eater, very picky. Autism and sensory sensitivity makes food options interesting for all of us. He gave this one two thumbs up! Great food, amazing staff, and a friendly environment make this local establishment one to remember.",

Girlfriend got a vegan burger, I got a real bratwurst done Brazilian style.   Interesting stuff.    Great friendly, happy service; delicious food.   We would come back.  I would rate this as 5 stars, but I advise you to do like me... Trust your gut, don't read the reviews, just look at the numbers and go with it.  Nearly 400 reviews and a 5/5 average.  That's rare.  And these hot dogs are good.    Enjoy!",

The cheese, sauces, everything can be made vegan! It is honestly delicious, especially since it is rare to find a sauce you can eat in a restaurant (anyone with dietary restrictions I know ya feel the pain on this one!).  I have heard so many good things about all the different meats and topping combinations, so you really can't go wrong with whatever you order. Their menu is huge with tons of options and modifications available - attaching a photo!  Highly highly recommend you stop in here. It is family owned and operated and honestly the nicest staff! Casual atmosphere and a patio for when the weather is nice. Thank you Simon's!",

My favorite that I've tried in the past is a coleslaw, peanut butter and sriracha dog....so needless to say I have wild taste and I was super excited to try Simon's. It does not disappoint.   If you're brand new like I was, they will likely suggest you try the Colombian Hot Dog - with pineapple, mozzarella cheese, simon's sauce and crushed potato chips. It's amazing how well pineapple goes with any cheese, and the crushed potato chips on top were the perfect complement. Just be warned, you'll likely be full after just this one dog.  Even after stuffing my face with the Colombian Hot Dog, I went for the second recommendation they gave -- the Tokyo Madness. Madness indeed, as this dog has teriyaki onions, wasabi mayo and nori. With a vegetarian dog, it kind of felt like I was eating a vegan ramen dish. Crazy I know, but you'll see what I mean when you try.  Side note: Really impressed that they offer both Torfurky Italian Vegan sausages as well as California Vegan dogs. Great for vegetarians/vegans, but don't worry omnivores -- I've been told the beef and pork options are also delish!",

I love me some kraut and mustard on one of their vegan dogs! I even got my boyfriend to join in on the vegan eats (he is totally not a veg head) and he thought they were quite tasty.   I got the German Traditional (brown mustard and kraut) with fries and my man ordered the Hola Amigo (avocado, cream cheese or tahini and either jalapenos or banana peppers) and a German Loka (brown mustard, wasabi mayo, kraut, and jalapenos or banana peppers). Everything was delicious!   The owner told us that he started adding veg-friendly items to his menu after many requests from staff from Oak Creek Brewery.

    "text": "Pretty much the only time I eat hot dogs is when I'm at a BBQ, and I'm starving, and I just want the meat that takes like, 2-3 minutes to grill while waiting for the good stuff that takes longer. It's not that I don't like hot dogs, I just don't prefer them.  Anyway, came here with a couple friends who wanted to try this place and I really liked it! The  thing that really impressed me was that the hot dogs (and buns) themselves were really good! With all the weird combinations of stuff they put on them I was expecting some sort of middle of the road boiled hot dog. They aren't. They're really good.   As far as \"weird stuff\" goes I got the Hola Amiga, which has creamy avocado, hummus (there was an option for cream cheese instead) and jalapeno. It was delicious. All of it. The toppings. The hot dog. The bun. The other two people I ate w/had the Colombian and they liked what they had as well.   We also split the macitas, which is basically a cheesy corn dip. Like the hot dogs, it sounds weird but it's yummy. Of course we had fries, and it almost felt strange to eat something so \"basic\" (and honestly they weren't anything special, but they tasted just fine).  Not sure if the guy working the counter was the owner, but he was very friendly and explained things on the menu. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at. There's no real decor & it's pretty sterile. Doesn't matter though. This place is all about the delicious, weird hot dogs.",

It has homemade coleslaw, mustard, Simons sauce with pineapple and crushed potato chips! Absolutely as good as it sounds. I got cheese fries as a side .

We were immediately greeted by the owner. The atmosphere was nice & modern. The menu had a good selection of hot dogs and other items that I recognized. We ordered the sweet plantains, patacones, and I went with the popular Colombian style hot dog. Everything was delicious!!! The sweet plantains were cooked to perfection, the patacones were served with this avacado sauce that was out of this world. I've had the sauce in the past and it was just like how I remembered it. And the Colombian hot dog & fries did not disappoint.  Loved the salty and sweet combo.  The pineapple & crushed chips on the hot dog definitely was a new twist but I enjoyed every bite. The bun gets 5 stars!!! I love supporting mom & pop restaurants & look forward to going back.",

From the outside it looked like it could be a dive, and I wasn't sure if I was in the mood to see if all the Yelp reviews were accurate, but I am so glad I did!  My husband and I both had the Colombian beef hot dog and my daughter had the plain Jane beef hot dog (she's 3). The Colombian hot dog was delicious! Perfect flavor blend, but not too strong. Also, you can tell it was crafted with care as each layer was perfectly and meticulously applied, and not just slopped on. The beef hot dogs themselves were tasty and good size.   After finishing our hotdogs, we on a whim decided to try the Alfajor cookies for dessert. They were amazing! I could see stopping by just to get a few to-go. You could tell they were freshly made today too. A perfect sandwich of 2 delicious butter/shortbread cookies with dulce de leche in the middle.   Service was amazing, and the restrooms were super clean!  Can't wait to come back to try more of their hot dogs! And of course get the cookies ;)",

Everywhere we go we try the food specific to that area and found Simon's. They call it the Sanoran cousin but it was delicious the only difference between the typical Sanoran and Simon's cousin is the substitution of refried beans instead of pinto. The creaminess of the refried was a pleasant and welcomed surprise. I would and do suggest this to anyone is the area or visiting. The staff as well were very patient and accommodating my group isn't always the easiest when it comes to ordering. And they still helped us with a smile. Irving was very attentive and helpful when needed. Definitely a winner in my book.",

With only the two of us there it took a long time to receive our food so prepare to wait a while on a busy night.  The food itself was yummy. The chili on the chili fries tasted like it was not restaurant made but rather tasted like it came from a can.  The restaurant itself looks a little rundown, out of date. A pick-me up would give this atmosphere a 360.  Overall, it was yummy. Might not return, but worth trying out.",

    "text": "Simon's was a pleasant surprise! Didn't know what to expect as we first walked in, but thought we'd trust fellow Yelpers on this one.    Why go there:  Sure enough, owner Felipe (from I gathered from the articles on the wall) greeted us, took our order and served us. He was great with all customers who were in the dining room, the place was fairly busy. The buns at this place is amazing, he mentioned it was locally baked just for them. We had a combo of hotdogs and the salchipapas, traditional Colombian street food. The fries were nothing short of amazing and very unique.  Don't miss: The salchipapas for the price are a good snack. A full Columbia style hot dog is also a good go to here, pair it up with a Columbia soda.  Overall: This place is affordable for being in Old Town. It's a small run operation, but delivers in flavor. A good place to swing by and get food to go if you'd like to walk around Old Town.",

We had the Sonaran Cousin and Cowboy, along with vegan Salchipapas that were delicious enough to be devoured by the meat eaters. The beef Frank's were high quality, along with the toppings and fried items that were cooked perfectly. We noticed that the owner decided to serve us because we were first timers, which was extremely sweet. They make some kickass passion fruit juice that reminded me of my childhood in Brazil, really the whole experience was fantastic. If you haven't treated yourself to a hot dog joint, this is definitely a great place to start. Oh and I forgot, the prices are extremely reasonable, and allow you to try every delicious thing you want off the menu. Bring it home to friends!",

My first dog was the Tokyo Madness - complete with wasabi mayo and seeweed with a beef dog; it was definitely my favorite; the flavors meshed together and I love that they were on a hot dog- who knew?!  I then tried their signature dog, the Colombian, which has pineapples and crushed potato chips. I was a little skeptical but complete with the pork dog, it worked surprising well in combination.  Finally I ordered a California dog with mushrooms and cheese. After having the more decadent dogs, this one didn't shine as brightly as the others, but was still a great mix of flavors and approach to a vegan dog. I've never tried a vegan hot dog before, the consistency was closer to something like a garden burger? (I have no benchmark for this one!)  I actually did have a bite of my vegan friend's vegan burger and that was one of the best non-meat burgers I've had. It reminded me of a Big Mac! I'd go back and reorder it with a few of the hot dogs as well.   The coolest thing about Simon's? The owner/chef is not even vegan but she creates vegan options for the vegan community. That deserves so much respect in itself but she also does it with such gusto that I tap my hat off to her. Now I see why Simon's is so awesome!",

The beef hot dog inside was just as good but the star was the mix of sauce, pineapples, chips, cheese and jalapenos. A great combo of sweet and spicy and the potato chips add great crunch. For 5.95 a pretty great deal too for the size and heft of the dog.  Everyone was super friendly inside from the staff to the customers.  Glad I stopped by and this hit the spot perfectly. Thanks Simon!",

Now that they are local I will visiting them more often!  The only complaint I have is the location, it is kind of hidden so they didn't have a lot of business during lunch.  I hope their dinner crowd is better so they can possibly expand to a bigger location or come to Tempe.   I recommend the Columbian beef hot dog, it is very tasty!  The sauces, crushed potato chips, pineapple, and hotdog make for a flavor explosion on your taste buds!  I haven't tried any of the other hot dogs yet but my co workers all got something different and they were very happy with their choice.  I think next time I will try the Sonoran Cousin or Wunderhund",

Braut's are cooked perfectly, buns are steam puffed but not soggy, and the toppings are new combinations for me but I love the way they work together.",

It was so tasty and I could tell that it was all fresh. I had the Columbian vegan dog (The dog is vegan, mozzarella comes on it though). It was ahhhhmazing! Hubby got the one with Cole slaw on it, and then we had to try the vegan chili cheese fries. Soooooooo good! It's a MUST! Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Yea, I know five stars for a hot dog joint but Simon's does it so well. Awesome All Beef hot dogs or Veggie, Vegan dogs if that's your thing. Which is so for my wife who is a vegetarian. Casual decorated hot dog stand. With outdoor seating available. I got the Colombian zig and the Tokyo Madness. Like I said terrific sized all beef hot dogs. Excellent toppings that allows you to get out of your comfort zone of yellow mustard and relish. What sets these apart are the bakery made buns that hold the delicious dogs and wonderful toppings. My wife had the Hola Amigo veggie dog. Large sized and nicely spice veggie dog. She loved it! We met the owners and they were super nice. Explained how they had the restaurant in Sedona but have moved it now to Scottsdale. Boy, are we happy about that! He brought us out some samples of the veggie chili, veggie ceviche and wunderhund sauce. So nice of him. We wish it was tomorrow already so we could go back!!!",

I was so excited to see they were moving to the valley. Unfortunately, the new location does not have the same personality that the old location did.  Just another strip mall restaurant. The good news is that the food did not change a bit!  The hot dog with mozzarella, pineapple and crushed chips is till fantastic.",
