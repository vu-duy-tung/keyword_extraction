The website made it look awesome so I really wanted to try it -- This was the BEST decision!    The look and feel of the place was great, very friendly staff who was happy to answer all of our questions.  We started with some salads and sorrentina.. Both tasted great. The star of it all was obviously the Pizza!!  It was the best pizza (and I live in Chicago, so I know :-P hahaha! only joking) But seriously! we ordered a margherita, Toto Sapore, and Peppino!  All were delicious!    The cherry on top of our time there was when Matteo, the chef, came out personally and gave us all a shot of his homemade Limoncello! He was very nice and talked with us for a bit and even let us take a picture with him. (we were complete tourist on this trip!)  :-)    Great place, if you are in the Phoenix area and haven't made a stop by this place.. What are you waiting for?!",

This time.. there was no limoncello. I was utterly disappointed, but you cant be upset at not getting something that was complimentary. Right?  Pizza wise, we got a red and a white. The red sauce is amazing. We ate the Carbonara which was just spectacular if you are a veggie fan. And a white pizza with egg (ill look up the name and update this) I really liked it, but it is very egg-y, the other people in my party did not enjoy it.  Now on for dessert. We got the creme brule and it was just spectacular. crispy but fluffy, refreshing.. great fresh fruit. Yum.",

I lived in Italy for awhile and have to say this was the closest I've had since my return. When compared to True Italian pizza, this was far closer and better than even Pizzeria Bianco. The service was good too. I will most definitely be back...very soon!!",

I realize that the pizza is VPN certified and that it has such fawning reviews but I thought it was just OK.  I liked Cibo better.  Honestly, I liked Grimaldi's of Scottsdale better.  However, their service, their atmosphere, and their deserts were fantastic.  I'm not saying don't go, just don't expect the Mona Lisa to eye you enviously as you chomp down on a slice.",

The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was the atmosphere of workers not quite sure what to do. Party of 7, no seating... Where do we sit them? At the bar. Where did walk carry out customer go.. I don't know. Who fills the ice? Apprehensive about asking who gets bill. It just seemed like they were brand new.. Maybe they were. Overall good place to eat!",

I was amazed how quickly the ladies got the tables ready for the next customers and the owner was very much involved. We had the Roma Salad and the Margherita Pizza and my wife had the Vespa cocktail which she thought was very refreshing. Before we left we were treated with a complimentary shot of is very own limoncello. It was simply a fantastic experience and our taste buds loved it! You have to ex price this place!

Only second to Juliana's Pizzeria in NY (The Original Grimaldi's). But lately the service there has been less than satisfactory. I used to go there every week and the Manager Maurizio took great care of us as did Selene and Desiree. But since Maurizio and Selene left and if Desiree isn't waiting on us the service is not very good.  I took some out of town friends there the other day and they ordered the meatball appetizers and they came out cold. The manager apologized and sent us out another order on the house and they were cold as well.  As much as I like the pizza I might have to find another lunch spot if something doesn't change.",

Great ambiance, with the owner hovering around, making sure everyone was having a good time. Nice!  We started off with some bruschetta and plate of Carpaccio. Both were delicious. We shared a Regina Margarita and it just took us back to their old location. Wonderful.   They say you cannot go back, well this Pomo's is pretty darn close to the original. Four and a half Stars rounded up to Five. Expect to pay $45 for two, including taxes but not gratuities.   Enjoy!!",

This really is one of the great pizza places in Phoenix.  Great Neopolitan-style pizza on par with almost anything you can get in Italy.    In our multiple trips here, we've had about half of the pizzas on the menu.  We always get a Margherita.  Any other variation of topping is just a variation on a theme of excellent base pizza.  The crust has good flavor, is well-blistered, and has really great chew.  The pizza is not over-sauced and the sauce is excellent in its simplicity - great tomato flavor, slight acidity, slight sweetness.  Their parmesan adds necessary tangyness, their mozzarella is very good, good cheese drag.  At this particular location - at the end of your meal, you will get a small plate of fried pizza dough covered in confectioner's sugar, and a shot of limoncello or crema di limoncello.  It's a nice touch that finishes the meal on a high note.  The staff is friendly and engaging, and the pizza, truly, one of the best in the nation.",

My boyfriend and I basically got the same dish but I got mine pizza style and he got his calzone style. We got the Calzone Napoletano and the Peppino. The calzone style had a lot more liquid. Both were equally delicious.   My boyfriend tried a German tap beer and I tried one of their signature drinks the Mulo- figazia vodka, pomegranate juice, lime juice, ginger beer. I really like the cooper mule drinks. This particular one tasted like fruit punch.  Overall we enjoyed the atmosphere, food and drinks. Very touristy.   Would liked to have had bread and oils provided but you can purchase for $2.   Overall we spent $75 for 2 entrees an appetizer not worth mentioning, 2 draft beers and a Mulo.",

On to food - I went with the Principe pizza on David the bartender's suggestion.  Great choice.  The pizza is absolutely fantastic and I am a tough judge since we have excellent pizza in NY.  They use fresh, imported ingredients.  The oven and most of the ingredients are straight from Italy.  I also got the Mista salad which is huge and very fresh.

When I order pizza that supposed to contain basil, I expect more than one leaf on the entire Pizza. Mushroom soup was excellent, and I wish I would have just had two bowls of that and not bothered with the pizza.  Someone else that my table had the panna cotta, and that wasn't very flavorful either, Although the strawberry topping was delicious. Would not eat here again. Try Cibo or Pane Bianco instead.",

The people are nice, the restaurant is clean.    The Regina Margherita is one of the best I tried.  They provide a bottle of olive oil on the table which I did use to drizzle on each slice.  It made my pizza extra juicy.  The pizza is fantastic on its own though.  I ordered the panna cotta, something I always wanted to try.  It came out plated beautifully with fruits and fried bread with powdered sugar.  Amazing!!  I would give Pomo 10 stars if I could.",

Downtown Pomo gives you high quality pizza made with love in each bite and ingredient. They provide a comfortable & intimate family vibe at their flagship location, and dont miss out on the owner capping off your evening with a serving of his famous not-for-sale limoncello.   Their wine list offers some of the best italian wine available by the glass in the valley, along with a selection of very reasonably priced delicious italian DOCG bottles.   Sit at the bar, grab a table inside, enjoy an evening on their romantically lit patio, it'll be a nice evening at Pomo.",

Wow, was this disappointing! First of all, the hostess said it was a 20 min wait & said she would call my cell when the table was ready. After about 25 mins we noticed several empty tables which sat empty for about another 10 mins-which is when we decided to ask about our table. She replied with an \"airhead\" response, \"I'm sorry, would you like to sit now?\"......uuuuuuhhh, no actually we want to keep waiting idiot!!!  Service was HORRIBLE!! Had the worst waiter, not friendly at all, worst attitude!! Don't waste your time or money here, seriously!!! Food was mediocre, at best.",

When you typically order pizza with prosciutto at a restaurant, you get 1 (maybe 2) measly chopped up pieces. At Pomo, they are so generous, which makes the pizza even better. The cocktails were great and super cute themed (Ferrari, Vespa, Maserati, etc).  Our waiter and the owner were the best, so accommodating and personable. I will definitely be going back.",

The restaurant is much better than deserving of nit picking, and since she'll be better with a little time, my rating cuts some slack & overlooks some problems with 1 person's lack of experience (for the record: unopened beers without an opener, bread and olive oil coming out after appetizers, and having to take food to go because of an organizational error on her part-we asked for antipasti & pizzas at the same time, but didn't happen). We did have two rambunctious boys getting fussy, this waitress and everyone there were very understanding and friendly with them. In honesty, this is a very nice restaurant that we probably shouldn't be bringing kids to anyway, so some of the blame is ours. Besides her, everyone else seemed extremely competent.  However, the food was excellent, fresh with great ingredients. We started with the bruschetta, and although we had to split 2 pieces between 3 people, it was fresh throughout with quality mozzarella and buttery rich olive oil. The other appetizer, veggie plate with olive oil, was good-not-great, felt like I could make the exact same thing pretty easily at home. Bread on the table was standard warm Italian bread, and the olive oil provided was lacking or they forgot to bring out the good EVOO, but didn't eat much of the fillers so wasn't an issue.  Bonus points for chef and staff speaking to each other in Italian, also for Duvel on tap. Great cute date place, intimate setting, cool atmosphere and decorations. I'd rather come here than most other higher end places we've found in Phoenix.  Pizzas were fantastico! I've spent cumulative years in Italy, and this could be something you'd find there. Not sure if they import Neopolitan water like at some places, but whatever they're doing it seems very close to what you'd find in Campania. I got the Pizza Principe off the \"classic pizzas\" menu, crust was perfect thickness and salt level, sauce was fresh and tasty, prosciutto and arugula added salt and savor to it all, Parmesean rounded the edges of flavors off nicely. We got a pizza margarita for the kids, and I couldn't stop eating that either, again great crust and sauce, and not too much cheese. My wife couldn't stop raving about the \"cheese-less pizza.\" Overall a very authentic and satisfying experience. Will be back, and even if it's a new waiter/waitress again, it'll still be worth it. Small place though, so might be a wait during weekend evening hours. Wish I had more time to try the home made Limoncello.",

    "text": "God do I love pizza done well, and this place knocks it out of the park. The atmosphere is your typical upscale hipster pie place (woods floors and tables, spare wire seating, hanging lights, pizza oven prominently displayed). The pizza is mindblowing. We had the porcini, bufala verace, and the chef. Thing crust, perfect char, amazing ingredients. The red sauce is light and bright, complimenting the richness of the cheese/toppings. The porcini are plump and earthy. On the white pizza, the prosciutto is draped over the cooked pizza to add just a hint of extra salt/umami/funkiness to the indulgently creamy base. This is everything pizza should be, with a great wine list to boot (I recommend their Montepulciano by the glass -- it's an excellent pizza wine).",

Also would recommend trying the Blood orange drink.  Really enjoyed it!  Great place for a date and also a celebration, i.e. birthday or anniversary.  Highly recommend this restaurant and hope to return soon.",

Finally we shared one of the best panna cotta we've ever had. But wait!  Just as we thought we were done, out comes the owner with  a creamy limoncello.  We will definitely be back.

Don't get me wrong, I like a good night out of boozing but not when I'm having dinner with my woman. My gf and I shared 2 pizzas, the margarita & another one with shaved parm & sliced prosciutto. Afterward the main pizza guy gave us a plate of some kinda fried dough dessert with powdered sugar. It was nice. Then he came by later and poured us a homemade shot of limoncello in little glasses. Immediately & pretty much automatically I raised this thing, acknowledged my gf & tipped it back to the heavens & slammed the glass down on the bar. After wiping my mouth & looking around the room I realized it was supposed to be enjoyed by something called sipping. It was a nice way to end the meal. Oh & the service was good, I recommend this place.",

It is thin, Neapolitan style pizza - so although a whole pizza to yourself may seem like a ton of food, it is actually not heavy or overly filling. Or, a nice lunch would be to split a salad and a pizza between a few people. The ingredients are authentic and Italian, and I love that the menu describes the items using italian words. It just ups the authenticity and makes it fun to try new things. I went there with my family of 6 and our food came out very quickly. Our server was great at answering our questions and was very good at prebussing (clearing the table of unnecessary plates, cups, flatware). She also made a point of just giving us time hang out and enjoy our company while not rushing to hand us the bill. The owner?/manager? came over and gave us free sangrias during the meal, and dessert/after dinner drinks on the house!  The hospitality here was truly amazing. I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 8 years now, and it is very obvious that the staff here is trained well and enjoys their work. Put that together with the amazing food and Pomo is the place to go!!",

The pizza came out first which was fine because I told him it was fine for them both to come out together but he did not bring me any olive oil.   The wine bottle came to my table already opened.  The waiter did not even pour my first glass for me or any  after.  I asked for it to be corked when I was finished with my meal, he pulled  a cork from his apron and put it on the table.  Since it was plastic I could not cork it my self, another waitress brought it inside to the bartender to cork.  My waiter brought my bottle out with a broken cork that was not the origin to my wine.  To make things worse I never got my limoncello!  I know I sound bratty but I am a teacher on a Friday night just expecting good service",

The food is so great which is why it is so sad for me to write this review right here :(  We had to remind our waitress that we were still waiting on our food, as she asked us if we would like any dessert even though we had not received our pizza. Once we got our pizza she brought out a salad, which we had already received previously. It was obvious she had no idea what was going on, as we were helped by two other employees.   I understand if they were short staffed, but it was difficult to be understanding when the staff were having conversations with other customers. Our water cups were never replenished and it began to seem like our waitress was actively ignoring us after the confusion. Food was good as always, but unfortunately will not be back as the entire time I felt uncomfortable and like an unwanted customer.",

    "text": "First and Foremost.... The food at Pomo is EXCELLENT!!! I have eaten here 6-7 different times and I consider Pomo to have my favorite Neapolitan Pizza in the country!!! I have talking up Pomo to my wife and kids for a few years. We live in SoCal and we're visiting Phoenix to go to the Fiesta Bowl. This was my chance to take them after the game and they could finally experience what I've been telling them.   We arrived late afternoon and were sat by a young lady. We were given water and then she came back a few minutes later and we ordered our food. My daughter asked for a lemonade.  After 10 minutes she finally brought us a glass for my daughter and then walked away. My daughter looked at it and said, \"Daddy. I asked for Lemonade. This is Sprite.\" The waitress was at the table behind us and I got her attention and told her she brought us the wrong drink. She said, \"OK!\" And then walked behind the bar.  We waited (and I'm not exaggerating) another 10 minutes. She was making mixed drinks and chatting with patrons that were sitting at the bar. I walked up and asked again, \"Can I please have my daughter's lemonade.\" She poured the drink and brought it to our table.   Our food was then ready and another server brought it to us. The meal was exceptional! Our waitress never once checked on us. She never once refilled our water glasses which were all empty. She never once refilled my daughter's lemonade.  We flagged her down once again and asked for a take out box for my wife's dinner and the check. Another 10 minutes go by and she is nowhere to be found. There were two other servers working that day. A waiter who was all over the place taking care of his tables. He was also the gentleman who brought us out food. He was great! There was also a lovely lady behind the bar. She was great, as well.  I waved at her and asked her, \"Do you know where our server is? We asked for a box 10 minutes ago and the check.\" She responded,\"I'm so sorry. I'll get you that box and your bill. I honestly don't know where she is.\"  Pomo is such a great restaurant. I'm happy that I've been there before and have had 5 star meal along with 5 star service. If this last trip was my first time there, it would have been my last.  That is how disappointing my family felt with the service.  Even a 5 star restaurant can have their reputation destroyed by a bad employee and she was really bad!",

We live in the desert. Water refills are a must. And yes, I would've liked another beer, but you never asked. Food was good, but service was lacking. It's especially frustrating when I watched you refill the wine glass of the guy beside me twice and conveniently only charge him for one.",

    "text": "These days, my girlfriend and I rarely venture to Pomo Downtown - previously opting to dine at their Glendale location that's closer to home. However, since the Glendale restaurant has recently been bought out and rebranded, it looks like we've come full circle and are back to dining in Downtown again.  Make no mistake about it - Pomo makes a great pie. We've always known this. From their use of quality ingredients to the slightly charred and flavorful crust, it's easily one of the better Neapolitan pizza options you can find in Phoenix.  As always, we typically start with bread and olive oil. It's nothing spectacular, but it's fine for what it is, I guess. During our most recent visit, they gave us a dribble of balsamic in a dish (and I do mean a dribble). We had to request the olive oil for some odd reason.   For pizzas, their bufala verace is easily their best, which is basically the proper form of mozzarella that is sourced from buffalo milk as opposed to a cow. Being the purist that I am, I can definitely say that this is the way it should be done.  I won't go into too much detail with the menu. There's your usual white and red pizzas. Everything is traditional and dare I say, playing it \"safe\" for the sake of authenticity. You won't find any of that barbeque sauce, ranch dressing, or chicken toppings here. When your pizza is good, there's absolutely no need to cater to corporate flavor - which is something that I wish the majority of the pizza makers in Phoenix would learn. The only thing that's odd about Pomo's menu is that many of their pizzas all seem exactly the same, with the exception of either adding or eliminating a single ingredient and changing the name.   House made desserts are also traditional - and while none of them really blow my mind, they're all respectable options. I like their Torta Nutella and Semifreddo. However, there's just something about their desserts that seems \"sterile\" to me. It's almost as if they're so safe that they come off as dull.  In the past, this Downtown location was particularly special due to the complimentary limoncello shots and fried dough that were served to you after you finished your meal. None of the other Pomo locations do this (at least to my knowledge) and I feel that it's an awesome touch that plays a significant role in people returning.  Please don't let old Yelp pictures deceive you. They don't do that anymore, as the man responsible for those little touches has since moved on.  Despite these complaints, I still feel that they serve up a pretty spectacular pizza that will always be a forever favorite of ours.  Highly recommended for the pizza!",

Good sauce and solid crust, but I personally could have used some more vegetables with more even distribution across the pie. Spicy salame is high quality and delicious - they also give you some spicy oil if you want to give it a little extra kick   Pastas are also all freshly made in house. We had the house lasagna and strozapretti. Both were delicious and devoured instantly. Highly recommend the pastas here too  For dessert, we went with the torta. Flavorwise, it was nice and chocolate-y but the cake could have been more moist. A little dry and felt a little stale vs what I was expecting.   Friendly service and great casual atmosphere! Would return for the food and maybe skip dessert or try the tiramisu next time!",

    "text": "I love this place. There, I said it. Right at the very start of my review! I love Pomo Pizzeria for its DELICIOUS food. I love it for its location right there on 1st St in downtown Phoenix (although other locations are available for those of you in Glendale, Scottsdale, or Gilbert!). And I love it for its consistently outstanding service.  I've been to Pomo Pizzeria many times, but will never forget my first visit ever. It was as if the owner could sniff out a newbie! Honestly, the quality personal engagement of the total team there was (and has continued to be) truly outstanding.  I was introduced to Pomo by one of my very closest friends, who \"dragged\" me along because she was THAT excited to have me experience the high level of service and delicious food she had come to expect from this location. I was not disappointed. The owner even treated us to a special little dessert drink of his own making after our meal completely free of charge!  I will admit that I am a bit of a pizza snob. Having grown up in New Jersey, I have that special brand of condescension found only in east coasters whereby we refer to New York pizza as the \"only real pizza\" to be found on this earth.  Pomo hasn't COMPLETELY cured me from this admittedly arrogant folly; however, I will say that I have tasted pizza at every pizzeria I can find in the Valley and Pomo Pizzeria continues to remain the easy #1 Top Choice for Best Pizza in or around Phoenix.  Pomo - you should know that I'm still searching for that one little out-of-the-way pizza shop to topple your reign, so you'd better keep up the amazing work!  If you haven't yet experienced the Pomo difference, you need to. Go do that sooner rather than later. You won't be disappointed! And Pomo - thank you, thank you, thank you for being so wonderful and delicious. I love you, and I'll see you again soon!  ;)",

This place is fantastically tasty and has the best service I have encountered in a very long time.  My hubby and I were hungry after Yelp's Downtown Revival Event and we had seen Pomo at the event.  They obviously support Yelp, which means Yelpers must support them.    We walked in around 9pm, so it was only about half full.  We took a seat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine.  The wine is all reasonably priced.  We ordered the Margherita pizza and added mushrooms (which might be a crime against humanity in Italy but that's how we like it).  We also spilt a salad to share.  The pizza was perfectly cooked.  Unlike some other Neapolitan pizza joints, this pizza had an even char across the entire pie.  It was an amazing pizza and you could tell that all the ingredients were the absolute best quality.  The bartender and our server for the evening, David, was making a delicious looking martini with hibiscus and peach schnapps so I went ahead and ordered one for myself as well.  I don't remember what it was called (the first glass of wine had already gone to my head) but it was one heck of a great martini.  For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee which came with strawberries and raspberries on top.  It had amazing vanilla bean flavor and you could see the flecks of vanilla bean in the custard.    I have to say that the service from David definitely put this place over the top in terms of quality for us.  Give that man a raise!",

The sauce is simple, the dough is fresh, soft, and really delicious.   Although Pomo has more ingredients on the pizza, such as arugula or sausage if you want, the dough is perfect. It really brought me back to the pizza I had in Naples. There seems to be a lot of pizza places in Phoenix and Scottsdale, and even a Grimaldi's opened in Scottsdale.   We had just had Pizza Bianco the day before, and Pomo is wayyyyyyy better. It's probably the best pizza place I've had in the states so far that serves napoletana pizza.   This was my most memorable meal next to Nobuo's in Phoenix. And for that, THANK YOU, Arizona!!",

After other plans fell apart, my girlfriend and I wandered in and were greeted with very nice service, which continued for the whole evening.  We started with drinks and crostini/I-don't-remember-what-they-called-it. The beer selection was strong but not too extensive. I prefer having an absurd number of choices, but this place isn't a beer garden and I found something I liked. If the entire meal had been as good as the crostini I might have given this review \"only\" 4 stars.  The pizza was outstanding. We got a white pizza, and it was easily one of the best pizzas either of us had ever been lucky enough to taste. It was probably the best I've ever had. I was blown away.  It was almost closing time when we finished. First, our waitress brought us a free plate of sugar-dusted fried desert \"chips\" (see the photo), and then the head chef came around with complimentary shots of limoncello. It was a fantastic end to the meal.  Do yourself (and maybe your significant other) a favor and check out this amazing restaurant.",

I never made it to that pizzeria but Pomo deserves a spot or at least high accolades.  They have an oven that was shipped from Naples, a section on their menu that's reserved for E.U. certified ingredients.  We tried 2 different pizzas, the Principe and the Toto Sopore and wow, when it comes out of the oven it's just heaven in my mouth!  Excellent crust, light sauce and not at all greasy.  When we finished, we had to try the cannoli after hearing so much about it on yelp but found it the almond/cream filling a bit bland.  We felt like we were visiting a friend's house by eating here.  Just as we were done.  The owner sent more desserts over!  Shots of Limoncello, Panettone, and thinly fried pizza dough spindled with powered sugar.  Very nice ends to our meal.

Hubs usually doesn't like thin crust, but he really liked the crust, and all the ingredients were balanced.  One star taken away: really should be 5 stars, but perhaps our waiter was new? Maybe it was his first job? We still had 3 pieces left of our pizza to finish and he asked \"so are we thinking of getting dessert?\" It was premature to ask and hubs and I looked at each other quizzically. We said \"no thank you.\" I added \"we're still working on the pieces we have.\"   Then there was 1 more piece of pizza left and he asked \"anything else I can get you?\" It was kind of him to ask. We said no thanks and he gave us the check right away. Felt like he was rushing to get us out...however there were about 5 tables occupied inside at the time and lots of other empty tables. By the time the pizza got to our table, and by the time we got up to leave, it was 20-25 mins.   Net-net, I felt rushed. I didn't take offense and maybe he was new to his job. But please don't rush customers about dessert when they aren't done with their main meal.   Extras: they provided a lightly peppered olive oil, parmesan, chili flakes and Italian seasoning on the side. This was definitely the piece that stood out!",

    "text": "This is the best pizza in phoenix. I had the shrimp and arugula pizza. The shrimp was tender the sauce was simple but perfect and the arugula set it off. What really makes this the best pizza is the crust and the sauce. The sauce is wet but the crust on the bottom manages to stay crispy. There is just a right amount of char on the crust so you can still taste the dough. I had to eat the entire thing and am now recovering with a long nap.   The service was great when I was finished the little Italian guy working kitchen (not sure if owner) gave me a shot of his home made lemoncielo and some fried dough with sugar. The lemoncielo reminded me of a cream pastry but with alcohol. Delicious!   Anytime I want perfect pizza I am coming here. Ps if you are a small group like 2 or 3 people sit at the bar facing the kitchen. It's quite entertaining watching them make pizza right in front of you.",

The decor is cute and modern and clean, although I can see this place getting packed because it is a small restaurant and I think it will get very popular soon.  I ordered the postafino (?) panini for lunch.  I love that it came with a small side salad with balsalmic dressing and big parmesan shavings.  Simple, lightly-dressed salads are my favorite! The panini itself was HUGE -- honestly, it's SO big.  Inside the panini was the perfect amount of melted cheese, arugula, and prosciutto.  For only $10, that panini is a great deal.  The other half of mine will be my dinner tonight.  Another plus is the olive oil and herbs/spices they bring out to dip your bread into.  They also have a spicy olive oil which is amazing.  I sprinkled some inside my panini and it gave it just the slightest kick.  I will most definitely be back, this place rocks!",

Anywho, the pizza here is amazing Neapolitan style pizza.  I think they've even been certified by some Italian Neapolitan association (along with only a couple other places in the Valley) that relates to the methods of cooking the pizza - so that's pretty cool I guess?  Does it make the pizza taste any better than the Italian style Pizza down the street? Who knows, but it clearly isn't hurting!    If I had ever been to Italy this would also be the section of the review where I ramble on about how it reminds me of that little Pizza joint just outside of Naples I went to and yadda yadda.  Check it out for yourself - I don't care if you are a deep dish person it is worth it.",

My friend and I went at 645 and it was busy but we barely had to wait 10 minutes and they suggested that we stop in at the turf for a drunk first(the bar next door). It was nice in there but a lot of green lighting, which doesn't really make anyone look good. We got our table and sat outside. The service was quick but not very careful. At first when our pizza came out, there were no plates, napkins or the toppings they are supposed to bring  with it. We asked for those things and the napkins didn't show up until we were almost finished.  The pizza was delicious, we got the one that starts with an a, I don't recall the exact name. I would defiantly eat here again.   One other thing was we both ordered a glass of the White House wine and it tasted like what I imagine pee tastes like. It was pretty gross, I'd suggest you splurge a little and go for a more expensive wine, you will probably have better luck.",

I was so impressed that we came back together for Sunday lunch before we flew home. Both times it was amazing; my wife was as impressed as I was. It took maybe four minutes for my pizza to arrive after I ordered it. They bake very quickly in the wood-fired oven. I tried the Toto Sapore and the Diavolo. Both were delicious, but the Diavolo (essentially a fancy pepperoni pizza) especially so. My server (the same both visits) was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. Nice atmosphere inside. There's a patio out front, as well, with a great few of the Westward Ho building.",

Seats were limited and had no choice to eat at corner of the bar. The place had a good vibe. And the food was great. At the end of finishing my meal i was cashing out to pay my bill, the dude with the long hair who works at Pomo knocked my drink over and my drink spilled on the counter top and all over my shorts and t-shift. Of course I kept my cool and behaved well and took it easy. The guy got a little annoying when he kept apologizing to me. A great way to make good impression to a place you'll never will come back to.  Felt embarrassed with my clothes wet was not something I had in mind.",

The grape tomatoes were a different thing for me and I loved it.   The pizza we enjoyed was the POMO: Italian Sausage, Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Sauteed Onions, Sauteed Mushrooms. It was fantastic! Thin crust, yet the flavor of the bread was present and complimented the tasty toppings.  If you can, get a seat at the bar by the oven. Not hot at all and you get to see the process. It's like dinner and a show!  To end the meal, have a generous slice of tiramisu. Perfect amount of ooz, if ya know what I mean.  I don't want to forget, the owner/mgr I believe, comes out with an unexpected bonus shot of homemade limoncello and honey drizzled pastry bits. My God it was heavenly.

We made reservation online because we happen to see the option. Got there...no reservations. They weren't busy so no big deal. We sit down among other families and within a few minutes the music changes to hard core hand banger hard rock. Then another song...same thing. We look at the surrounding of old Hollywood photos and say to each other...are we missing something? We tell the waitress...who then sends a manger (I'm assuming because he didn't identify himself). Both not opting to change the obviously obnoxious music but ask us if we like it? Really???? He wasn't getting it and we had to give him the analogy of \"outside of a tattoo shop, where is this music ever appropriate???  Of course he doesn't answer that and hardly looks at me anymore trying to convince us this is appropriate...but he wants to make us happy (at this point coming across patronizing). It gets changed with the statement they are catering to a young downtown crowd. Food comes. Tastes great but pizza is the soggiest thin crust pizza I've ever had. Was surrounded by fruit flies while we ate (no bug light anywhere of course). If you've seen any of the bar rescue shows you know if there are fruit flies flying around customers...they are also flying around and most likely floating at the bottom of the alcohol bottles. We don't know for sure and I certainly wasn't about to ask the long haired bartender to check. To add to our amazing experience we are sitting along a full length padded bench...of which our section is the only one not all torn up. Chairs are all nicked and worn. To a young downtown crowd these may not be a concern...clearly. But to the rest of us we expect a bit more.",

Our last visit we got the mango salad.  The portion size is generous and enough for two, but it tasted like there wasn't enough dressing, the lettuce was chopped so small you almost needed a spoon to scoop it up, and it tasted like it had cabbage in it (it was supposed to be arugula and baby lettuce).  The pizza was okay, but needed seasonings and I think $16 for a 12-inch pizza is just too expensive.  Service is a little lagging and with the exception of the manager on duty, no one seemed particularly happy for my business.",

    "text": "We visited downtown Phoenix for the Home Show and needed a place to eat. Opted for Pomo because Matt's Big Breakfast was too busy (probably why we've never been there). We had been to Pomo's Scottsdale location when they first opened and never returned because we just weren't wowed. We still weren't wowed.  I guess I'm very particular about my pizza because of my strong Italian roots. The crust was good, nice amount of char but overall just tasteless pizza. We had the Margarita Pizza and the Pizza Chef. Both good size pizzas but no distinct flavors, the tomato sauce was bland, very light in color; definitely not a hearty sauce even for pizza. If it wasn't for the prosciutto on the Chef  it would have been completely tasteless. I've been to much better pizza places in the Phoenix area.",

I have been to this location as well as the Gilbert location and both have been great experiences. My favorite pizza is the Toto Sapore and I also love the Peppino. I have also tried the lasagna and another pasta dish and both of them were incredibly fresh and tasty. One of the best parts about this restaurant is the ambiance and the owner. The shot of homemade limoncello at the end is seriously the best way to end the meal. I don't think I will ever be able to find a better pizzeria than Pomo.",

The taste combination is actually delicious when you can actually taste chunks of the two together.  I wish there were more chunks of Brie cheese and prosciutto. Otherwise my second pick would've been a meaty pizza.  It went nicely with a glass of Syrah. Then at the end they also gave us fried dough and limoncello! :)",

Each time things seem a bit more polished and hey, some of the downtown patio seating you can find. I also noticed that they have a number of local brews on tap in their bar area. I like their outside seating so much that I've literally never gone inside the restaurant, though in the summer I have a feeling that will change.   I've never had anything bad here - the pizzas are wonderful and a friend of mine tried the meat lasagna today and it looked delicious. I also like their appetizers. For those counting calories the roasted veggie app is delicious and the pizza's - I have to say, I'm a crust aficionado and the crust on the pies is wonderfully crispy and the pies, literally as good or better than any I had when I was in Naples a few years ago.   Wait staff is also friendly and efficient and the owner always seems to be around, providing fried dough crisps with powdered sugar and if you are lucky, a shot of his homemade limoncello.  There are a lot of good eating options in the area but this place, this seems to b e the best.",

We stopped in for lunch and it wasn't busy at all but for some reason the service was very slow. We ordered arancini and 2 pizzas - the arancini were very underwhelming. I think they breaded the rice balls in cornstarch before deep frying them because the outside had a hard shell texture. The pizza crust was very good but the sauce and cheese were both pretty bland. We also had one Bellini and one beer and our total bill was $60 which I thought was pricey for what we were given. There are definitely better pizza spots in the area so I doubt we'll be back.",

We were SO HAPPY to find that after the remodel things were back to their previous standards! We had pizza and pasta and both were great (pizza once again cooked just right and pasta cooked perfectly). The staff were once again exceptionally courteous and helpful. And, best of all to us, the Peroni was served in proper glasses, and was the cleanest tasting, most effervescent beer we've had so far in Phoenix. Kudos to the management and staff for listening. We live very close by and are very pleased we have our favorite spot back.   My husband and I were super fans of this place. We live around the corner and came here at least once a week. Great pizza and salads, but most of all it was the personal, neighborly service we got there from Dave who ran the bar. Unfortunately we recently went again and Dave was gone and the vibe and atmosphere had died without him. On the first visit I was made to order my takeout at the hostess stand and when I asked if I could have a drink at the bar while I waited they seemed put out and told me I would have to open another tab. On our second visit with my daughter who is gluten free, we were told they were out of gluten free crust that day. No one seemed to care. It's such a shame that a great neighborhood establishment changed so dramatically for the worse overnight.",

Great appetizers and desserts as well. If you're vegan, they can make a vegan pizza for you! They always have a handful of gelato flavors on offer. The last time we were there, I had the Ferrero Rocher flavor and it was unbelievable....best gelato I've ever had....and I've had a lot! The server also brought me a sample of another kind of gelato she thought I'd like, which was super nice of her. They didn't do this the last time we were there, but in the past they've given us a complimentary limoncello shot after dinner. It made us feel like we were in Italy. They have some pasta dishes which I'm sure are good, but I just love their pizza so much that I never get anything else.

    "text": "I went to Pomo Pizzeria on a very slow weekend afternoon. I checked in with the host and said I had a reservation which she didn't even look; she asked if I wanted to sit at the bar. IM CLEARLY in a wheelchair I thought is this lady was insensitive. She directed me to a table and gave me a menu. I waited 15 mins to get ice water then the waitress came over again and took my order. I had a pizza which was not tasty at all and the ice tea was blah. I'm so surprised with all the hype I gotten to try  this restaurant and all the Tv promos and billboards I've seen that the food was not tasty at all. It took 15 mins to get my pizza. The service was less desirable as she was too busy helping the outside tables then to refill my drink and ask me if I needed anything else. I waited 30 mins to get my check awful.  The likelihood of my spending my hard earned money to go back or recommend this restaurant is NOT AT All. I have been all over the world as a foodie and I think that CIBO is still the greatest restaurant for Pizza in Central Phoenix.",

    "text": "Pomo Pizza! Cute little place that seems to be relaxing and perfect for a night out. Its small inside so coming around a time that they arent crazy busy would be a good idea.  They had a very simple menu of pizzas, pastas, salads and appetizers. I had a hard time picking a pizza seems how Im satisfied  with just a pepperoni and bacon pizza. These were no ordinary pizzas. Very sophisticated and created with a lot of thought. Unfortunately, my palate is not that sophisticated with something of this nature so I was trying hard to love it.   Our waiter recommended the Don Alfonso Pizza. It was good but I didnt love it like I thought I would, I guess im just so used to greasy pizza!  We also ordered the lasagna al Forno. Now this is the best pasta I have EVER had the pleasure and honor of eating. The sauce was absolutely amazingly rich and tasty. I literally could not stop eating it I didn't even need the pizza anymore. All I wanted to do was savor the sauce and the taste. I highly recommend anyone who likes lasagna to please try this I don't think you'll be disappointed! I would come back just for this everyday if I could.  The service was spectacular and the waiter seemed to be very attentive even though he had many other tables to worry about. After dinner they also give you lemoncello shots which were a bit different for me but if you're into that thing you will like it. (I wasnt into it) Definitely worth a try if you're in the area!",

We had the good fortune of stumbling across this place on an exploratory walk (although I was aware of the good reviews...) before closing time for the afternoon (2:00 PM) and we ordered the Marghareta - which is our favorite - and this was decidedly one of the two best we have had the pleasure of enjoying here in Phoenix.  The other is just a few blocks from here and from where we are staying and it is going to be a difficult choice to decide which one to come back to first!   The service was great - friendly, quick and informative - and the location is fabulous.  We had the pleasure of sitting outside on the porch.   I have to admit I have no idea how the Pizza Hut across the street stays in business!   The prices were quite fair for what we received.  The pizza was at tasty as any I have ever had...and I just decided that Pomo will be the next place we go...again!",

I believe the majority of great reviews for this place are being posted by people who have not experienced classic Neapolitan style pizza in any other setting. If you are used to the pizza hut across the street then you will find this place fun and exciting with a new take on pizza flavors. However in my opinion the flavors were all wrong, the crust was very good, the sauce and topping combinations were where this pizza fell short in my opinion. The lasagna was very good but it is the only \"pasta\" on the menu, if you want bread with your lasagna be prepared to pay for it. Our service was horrible although I do not think this reflects on the restaurant as much as the individual who was serving us. Our drinks came out with no ice, when we questioned this we were told the ice machine was broke and they were down to there last bag. I understand things happen but it would have been nice to have been informed of this situation before they were brought to us. Overall I feel this place is trying to hard to be an upscale pizzeria and falling very short.",

    "text": "A cute little bistro with a delightful European feel, Pomo seems like a good place for a drink and/or pizza. I stopped in for a glass of wine and a late-night snack with my husband. We spit the sorrentina appetizer which is grape tomato bruschetta with a base layer of melted mozzarella. The two large pieces were enough to split. The Syrah I had was wonderful, and my husband enjoyed a glass of chianti reserva. Both of us reminisced on our trip to Italy last year and enjoyed the beautiful patio on a surprisingly cool September evening in Phoenix. We didn't have a chance to try the pizza, but the orders for other tables made us want to come back to try them. The menu has lots of options for pizza and dessert as well as a lunch menu with a selection of panini. The service was a little slow getting the check but this may have been because we were taking a while to enjoy our wines. It's a little on the pricey end with wine by the glass averaging $8-$9 but the pizzas seemed worth the price at $12-$16 with several couples nearby splitting just one pizza. Overall, a great find for what we wanted, and we will be back again to try the pizza.",

Fifteen minutes after being seated, we still hadn't been served. We never really had a waiter: a man (who I think was the manager?) ended up taking our order and, although he was really nice, he was busy with his other work so we never really saw him again until the end of our meal. By contrast, the table across from us had two servers: a server who did his normal duties and another server who they seemed to know and who came to the table to chat, no exaggeration, about every five minutes. I actually thought she was just part of their party at first since she sat down with them a few times. It was odd, since there seemed to be so many servers on duty to be completely ignored. I loved the food, but I just felt like I overpaid for such an irritating experience. I'd suggest takeout, since eating in is an exercise in frustration (unless you know one of the waiters personally)",

Even since I got back from living in Italy for 3.5 years I've been searching for authentic Italian pizza that I grew to love during my long stay there. Then sommelier at school told me about Pomo. I decided to give it a try. The first time I looked at the menu I knew this place was legit. I saw my favorite pizza from Italy the capricciosa. Of course I ordered it and wow I finally found what I had been searching for all that time.  All though it can seem pricey to some people but people have to realize the ingredients that have to be imported from Italy to make these bad boys. Hell real San Marazano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella are not cheap imports. This is one of my favorite places to take family and friends when they come in town. The staff and the owners are so friendly and make you feel like family. If you haven't tried this place you owe it to yourself to go.",

We started with a caprese salad which was nice and fresh. Our main course was a shared CAPRICCIOSA Pizza with Artichoke Hearts, Gaeta Olives, Prosciutto Cotto, Sauteed Mushrooms all on a perfectly crisp paper-thin crust. YUM. Watching the chef/owner make a staggering number of pizzas in very little time works up an appetite, at least for us, so, even though everyone was given a complimentary dessert of thin crispy strips of pastry with powdered sugar, which we loved, we ordered dessert. We shared a semi-fredo that was cool and a perfect ending to our meal, or so we thought.... We were delighted to receive two complimentary shots of creamy limoncello that the chef poured for us himself. TO. DIE. FOR. We'll be back and I'm going to order some more of that drink. It was like lemon pie in a glass with a kick.",

    "text": "Inconsistent: I've been to Pomo twice. The first time had excellent service; however my pizza was a bit burnt and the dessert was just absolutely awful. I also ordered a mixed salad, which was nothing special but at $10 I would have expected something a little more.   My second experience at Pomo: the service was horrible. I sat for almost 10 min without someone stopping by to take my order. No one came by for a good 10+ min after I was finished with the pizza and I was in such a hurry I just gave them my credit card to run the bill. When I got the check back (after an unacceptably long wait) I noticed they ran through the wrong pizza and then charged me an additional $6 for mushrooms. I was in too much of a hurry to tell them and they wouldn't have returned for 15 min anyways. In total, 1 pizza cost me $27 not including tip. The pizza was good but absolutely not worth $27.   Overall, I'm conflicted on whether or not I will return. I don't want to go back there due to my bad experience but since I stay downtown during the week and it's within walking distance from my hotel, I may return.   One thing I definitely want to eat again is their tomato sauce. I would buy it in jars if they sold it. It is some of the best I've ever had. Also.. the mushrooms they charged me an additional $6 for (when I ordered their mushroom pizza, which comes with mushrooms).. anyways, they were delicious.",

Then I tasted it and I immediately noticed a difference. The bread was soft yet perfectly cris and the toppings was absolutely delicious and high quality.   The staff was great and we got to meet the manager because of a minor hiccup and he made sure we were more than satisfied at the end.

However, seeing the other 2 places right next to it completely empty intrigued me.  Our pizza, the Toto Sapore, took a while to get...but...one bite...that's all it took.  All was forgiven.  All was right with the world.  Salami on pizza really is proof that God loves us.  Shockingly good pizza.  Our bruschetta (the one with avocado) was also fantastic as was the quite unique limoncello.  All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this place.  Can't wait to go back and try another pizza (and some grappa)!!!!",

However, the reviews of Pomo Pizzeria caught her attention and I have to say I wished I would have found the pizzeria first. I would have received a few \"get out of the dog house\" credits. Unfortunately now she gets them.   When we arrived, the immediate available seats were at the counter where they prepare the pizza. It was awesome sitting there watching them prepare the pizza. Because the pizzas were not deep-dish, we decided to order a pizza each. I ordered the Pomo and my wife ordered the Toto Sapore. Needless to say I devoured my pizza in record time.   After we were done, we were given these thin strips of bread(?) that were deep fried and coated in powdered sugar. Delicious! To finish it off, were were given a shot of  creamy limoncello. Again, delicious!   Aside from the food, the restaurant has a modern-style look to it with a great atmosphere. And the wait staff was incredible. Bottom line, if you want to eat an incredible pizza at an incredible place, I'd highly recommend Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana.",

My family gets different pizzas, and they always love it, so I'm probably wrong, but I still don't want to take the chance. I've since moved to Seattle and have developed cravings for this pizza.

There are so many great spots downtown including the notorious pizzaria bianco but Pomo is also pretty good if you don't want to wait hours for your pizza.

I have no idea where people park, though. It's tucked away on a side street. We walked from cityscape.",

I came here for lunch so next will be out on the town for dinner and boy I can't wait. The pizza, oh the pizza, is just delectable. The mixed trio bruschetta appetizer is also just splendid! Ending the meal with a cappuccino felt like I was in a small town in Italy. Way to go Pomo!  I have nothing but great things to say about this place and cannot wait to return! Whose in?! Ciao!",

Hopefully, they will revamp those parts of the menu or just take those sections off and make the pizzas cheaper ;) Other than that, this is my favorite pizza place by far!",

The greens were fresh, the grape tomatoes flavorful and the shaved parmesan was very good. The chef brings out a small bottle of aged balsamic for the dressing. Next came the pizza, which was piping hot, and topped with melting bufala mozzarella. It was delicious, just as I remembered. I will definitely be back!",

We repeated that we had made a reservation and politely asked to see the manager. While we were waiting, the hostess that had been talking to us seated a couple of parties that walked in with no reservation at all, including one larger party of 6. Then when the manager finally came over, all he wanted to do was argue with us about whether we had called the right location to make our reservation. We ended up leaving and taking our business to the restaurant next door. I don't care how good your food is, if you cannot care for your customers properly, you will not get my business.

The Caprese came out first and the tomatoes and mozzarella were really poor quality. It's not like I don't realize tomatoes are out of season but they could really do better than that. The mozzarella was just bad over all, the texture and taste. Seeing as how bad the mozzarella was, I had our waiter change the cheese on our pizza to the buffalo mozzarella which was like 3$ more just to hope it would turn out better. Our pizza arrived, I expected the buffalo mozzarella to be a bit more watery, but our pizza was literally flooded with the water from the buffalo mozzarella and was a nightmare.  I don't drive all the way out to Phoenix often, and I usually just do it to go to nice restaurants I find on Yelp. Such as Bianco, Matts, and Atoyac; and I always seem to have a good time and experiance at all of these but this place let me down.",

This is an LA (my new home) Zagat 22.    The food is good but not amazing.  The bruschetta was tasty but bland; my wife and I had to dump salt all over it to bring it to life.  The burrata salad was also good.  It too lacked a bit of salt but was tasty.  The burrata was nice and fresh.  The pizza is the real winner on the food front.  We had the Pomo (sausage, peppers, mushrooms) and it was amazing, not to mention fast -- the pizza was ready in 90 seconds.  The sauce had just the right amount of acidity and the dough was perfect--decliciously crispy with just the right amount of salt.    The service also deserves a special mention.  The bartender (a short fellow with a pony tail) was awesome.   He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.  The waitresses -- meh, the opposite -- they were just ok.  Also, the owner/manager offered us Limoncello (albeit in an EVERCLEAR bottle) which we passed on.  My days of drinking grain alcohol (or whatever it was) are long gone.  Nice touch nonetheless.  Three issues:  I encountered not one but two hairs during my meal.  One long one on my glass of ice water, and a short one in my salad.  Nasty but it happens and I didn't make anything of it.  The third:  the bathroom was in shambles.  No soap, no towels.  I expect better from any restaurant, let alone one a Zagat 26 (hah).  Probably a result of it being Super Bowl eve.  I told one of the waitresses about the issue and when I returned later the soap issue was fixed, the towels, not so much.  Training issue.  All in all, not a bad spot if you're in Phoenix.",

Living downtown, that was always a bit of a hike, but it was worth it. Now that they're downtown I feel like my life is complete.   We are very fortunate to have some world class pizzerias downtown and around Central Phoenix. With one exception, I've tried them all numerous times. Obviously any review is opinion-based, but I would whole-heartedly say that Pomo is the superior of them all. I've never had anything that was not absolutely delicious here. I've yet to try their panini and pasta, but the pizza, salads, calzone, and desserts are all out of this world. Dessert-wise, the semifreddo is the one we come back to most often. The Romana salad is always a great way to start. Pizza-wise, the carbonara is a rich little treasure that deserves your attention. The diavola is spicy, but well-balanced, and is another \"must.\" Really, you could probably close your eyes and pick randomly and be so far from disappointed you'd find yourself in a foreign land.   At the end of every meal the owner brings out powdered sugar covered fried pieces of dough that are almost paper thin. At dinner these are also accompanied by homemade limoncello that is syrupy thick and delicious. There's even a cinnamon version that you will thank your lucky stars you were fortunate enough to try should it be available.   So Pomo, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for doing what you're doing. I can't wait to spend more time enjoying your fare, and I wish you unlimited success!",

The cannolis, tiramisu and crem brulee. Mmm. Perfect desserts. My roommate swears by the tiramisu.   The atmosphere was fantastic. The waitress was so great! She actually convinced us to come back just to try their sandwiches. They let us stay past closing as we finished our bottle of wine and were very accommodating!",

    "text": "Hands down, best pizza in Phoenix.  We've tried several of the eateries around town, becoming regulars at Federal and Parlor. But it's not even in the same league.  It's been a long time since I had a high quality piece of Italian pie. Throw in the fact that cannolis are on the dessert menu and my craving for pizza Saturday night was sky high. Not far from our house, we figured we better try it now before we move.  We arrive on a decent weather night around 6:30. The place is packed. 45 minute wait for a table, or sit now at the bar. We opt for the bar as it's just the two of us and we are hungry.  Start with caprese (so delicious and the mozz is amazing). Yum. Two pizzas. Husband demolishes his. I finish half because, ahem, I want cannoli. Both amazing. Well, mine was great (Margherita), I never got a chance to try husbands.  OMG, the cannoli. I haven't had cannoli since Sicily in 2009. I was SO FREAKING HAPPY. I want them now. I want them all the time. Knowing that I can get cannoli like that here in Phoenix is dangerous knowledge.  We've got about 3 weeks before we leave Phoenix. We'll be back.",

Every dish I've tried (from the grilled veggies, to the soup, to the many pizzas) has been wonderful. It's also not absurdly pricey and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The owner also comes around after each pizza is put out and brings the cheese and this delicious spicy olive oil. He's very friendly and loves to give you a shot of limoncelo if you're lucky!  1 pizza is great for 2 people to share. It's more fun in a bigger group where you can get a few to try all the yummies. Ingredients are top notch, the dough is fabulous, and give me all the mozzarella please! I always suggest Pomo when we're wondering what to do for dinner and can't wait to try all their pies.",

In addition to the dining room there is a dedicated outdoor seating area right off the sidewalk, which are both clean and well arranged.  This being my first visit i wanted to try something different, so I ordered a Capri Panini.  The panini was large and was similar to a folded pizza. The \"bread\" is made from the same dough as the pizza, and cooked in the same ovens so it is fresh and crisp.  The roasted vegetables and mozzarella were ample and flavorful.  Although this sandwich was very good, it did have one issue...The protein.   The sausage could not hold it's own with the other flavors in the sandwich.  At one point I even questioned whether they had forgotten to put it in at all and opened half of the sandwich to find only a few small \"coins\" of sausage.  In my estimate, there was less than a half of sausage in the entire sandwich.  I understand that the secret of preparing food is to balance flavors, however, if the diner is left searching for the \"star of the show\" then in the end it is a failure.  My guest had the Contadina pizza which looked great and he was very happy with it.   I will return to try the pizza.",

The staff is friendly and helpful and as soon as you walk in the door, the amazing smell that takes you over lets you know you are in for something really good.  Ambiance is nice, casual, warm and inviting.    We ordered their version of the meat lovers pizza to split and it was ridiculously good.  Impressive stone pizza oven in the corner produces thin, crispy pizza that is just the way i like it.  Looked like a lot of the ingredients were imported, which added to the authentic taste.  Free powdered sugar dusted fry bread at the end of the meal that was the perfect ending to a really satisfying meal.  Will keep this in mind for future trips to Phoenix and definitely recommend you check it out.",

They just don't make pizza as good out here and no joke, walmart bests dominos and the rest of the average . I have been throwing parties for 20 yrs and make my own pizzas. I enjoy others who make excellent pizzas. Drove an hour to get here wasted my time gas and money. One day I heated up a walmart pizza. I thought Walmart was a joke. Wrong!",

I've been a server for 10 years so it pains me to leave one of these reviews but this was honestly some of the worst service I've experienced in a long time.   Pizza was good. Service was absolutely awful. The people around us were experiencing the same. We were a party of 8 and sat without menus for a good 30 minutes until we had to go up to the greeter and ask. Had to flag down our waiter every time we wanted to order a drink or food. Just seemed like a very amateur wait staff.   Hope they figure it out.",

The remodel renders the place soulless and confusing.  The waitress was shocked by Arugula and said manager is coming.  He never stopped by to check in or talk to us.

How about dimming the bright lights a little and playing softer music so you don't feel rushed or want to chair dance while you eat.

I loved that I could see the wood burning pizza over from my table! Everyone who was over 21 got a super yummy shot of lemoncello- ON THE HOUSE after dinner. The ambiance was cozy. I would recommend making reservation since there were not that many tables. Salute!",

The pizza sauce tasted like it came from a can and the crust was also really bland. On top of the food not being great, we received bad service. Our server barely checked on us and didn't make sure our food came out okay. Something else that i felt was strange was how quickly the pizza came out. We ordered it and less than 10 minutes later the pizza came out. It seemed a little too fast for the pizza to have been made fresh. We definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "Vegan review: Pomo's downtown location is small but pleasant. They offer several vegan (or can be made vegan) options (pizza, pasta, bruschetta, anti-pasta and of course salads) and use what I assume is Daiya vegan cheese. The vegan pizza has a nice thin crust and excellent tomato sauce. They put the cheese on a little heavily though, so it can get a bit overwhelming. I usually ask them to cook it well done so the vegan cheese melts completely. It's not the very best vegan pie in town, but it is tasty! I've had the bruschetta before as well, and it's a meal itself. I believe the minestrone is vegan (it's marked as vegetarian) and tried it once, but wasn't that impressed. It was a bit bland. The bread served with it is excellent though!  What I really appreciate is how clearly they've marked the menu to indicate what is vegetarian and/or vegan. It makes ordering so much easier! The service is always great, and the location has a nice covered patio for the days and nights when the heat isn't too overwhelming. Most of the parking nearby is metered, and it can get very full during school days because it's so close to ASU's downtown campus. There's usually not a problem finding a spot in the late afternoon or evening though.",

Then, Stan complained because we needed 4 separate checks for 14 people. Lastly, he called out drink-types 1 by 1 and told everyone to \"raise your hand\" instead of addressing each diner individually. I asked him if perhaps another waiter, more accustomed  to dealing with large groups would be better.  Of course he is still severing us, so the end result will remain to be seen.  So far, 10mins later and we are just now getting drinks, which he can not remember who-ordered-what & we are missing one drink. Stan has apologized for the \"misunderstanding,\" which we have accepted. I believe you can do better Stan & Pomo.  Part2 to come........Spoke w/manager (Fransisco?) who was very understanding and open to constructive criticism. Admitted to Stan being a new employee and needing more staff.

Not because he's my boss, but because part of his job description is \"to entertain and take employees and clients out to eat\" so duh, he eats alot!  We get seated outside on the patio. The weather was gorgeous and we ordered the Toto Sapore and the Crostini. The crostini was ok - it was similar to a brushcetta board: one with ricotta, one with mushrooms, and one with salmon.  It was ok and I probably would not order it again.  The Toto Sapore: Italian Sausage, Pancetta (Bacon), Salame Piccante, Prosciutto Cotto (Ham) was amazingly good! The crust was thin and crunchy, and the sauce was not too thick.  I loved it!  After our entrees, we were given complimentary fried wonton chips (not sure if they are called any other name) and powdered sugar.  It was a sweet gesture, but it didn't taste that great so we opted to order the Hazelnut chocolate cake - it was incredible! It was so rich so we took half of it home and that thing was gone before bed that night.

The menus were covered with stains and the tables were not clean, but had crusted sauce all over them. The cheese and pepper shakers looked like they had never been wash before. The options for food was very limited. The prices were outrageous for a personal size pizza. The pizza we got was okay. The thin crust was excellent! However, the cheese and toppings slid off the crust when we picked up a slice because of the grease on it. The sausage and spicy salami were good though. You are better off going across the street to Pizza Hut for pizza.",

    "text": "\"Prego!\" Little did I know this word would become so near and dear to me. Here, say it with me. It's not fair to ask unless an Italian has blessed your ears with the sound.  Use your imagination and listen to the Colombian from New York describe the Italian. Roll your lips inwards gently, breathe in through your nose and roll those \"R's\".   \"PRRrrreee-G-o!\" To be clear, added emphasis on the \"G\".   Maurizio greeted us with \"Prego!\" as soon as we were seated. Or at least that's what my myopic memory will always hear. From deep within his belly, a short percussion, out came \"Prego!\" Waters were seamlessly on the table when I inquired about the sign outside.  \"Wine for $5?\" \"Yes. We have a Sangiovese for five dollars.\" \"Prego. Pronto!\"  Out came the biggest goblet of wine in my history of life. Still shocked at the enormity of my vino I peeked at the menu. I looked at my friend. We agreed we wanted pizza. Mensa candidates the two of us. There were three columns and we sought assistance. Starved and envious of our neighbor's plates we desperately wanted to place an order.   Maurizio efficiently highlighted the differences. All pizzas are thin crust and twelve inches. \"Classica\" = imported tomato sauce. \"Tradizonale\" = respects Napoletana style standards. \"Focaccia\" = No tomato! A pizza and a salad was Hoovere'd down. I had no idea. But now YOU do. I wanted to eat more of the pizza. I haven't stopped talking about the pizza. I was perfectly satiated by the amount of food shared. However, I could have scarfed another slice or two down!   Toto Sapore was the perfect pizza that night. The meat wasn't too salty (italian sausage, pancetta, salame and prosciutto), the sauce was introduced but not overwhelming, the crust was crispy but not wafer thin like paper and passed the fold test. Because really, pizza is meant to be eaten held in your hands.   The Insalate Pollo offered a generous share of pine nuts, avocados, grilled chicken (not dry at all!), grape tomatoes on spring greens with a lemon vinaigrette. I was surprised the lemon vinaigrette wasn't too strong. I've got my mind on trying the mango salad next time. Goals, we all have to have goals.  \"Dessert?\" I still have a half filled goblet of wine. In my haste to consume pizza it had been left unattended. (Unheard of!) We begged off on sweets. Suddenly two little shot glasses appeared at our table.  \"Prego!\" And then a plate of thinly cut, fried dough, sprinkled with powdered sugar. \"Limoncello! On the house!\" As Maurizio's friend, (because everyone is friends at this restaurant), filled our teeny tiny glasses with a bottle that read, \"EVERCLEAR\", we were armed with instructions.   \"Sip the Limoncello.\" Gingerly I approached the Limoncello. Despite my concerns about consuming a grain alcohol it was *delicious*. Alas, I drove, so I had to pass over my dessert drink to my dining companion.  Thinking the night couldn't possibly end on a sweeter note, Maurizio brought out two chocolates. When unwrapped they held special messages.   \"A man enjoys the happiness he feels. A woman the happiness she gives.\" \"You will always be beautiful to me and I will always be True to you.\"  The Italians love romance. Bring a date ;)  By the way, \"Prego!\" has multiple uses. (After being thanked) You're welcome, don't mention it etc. (In response to a request) Yes, of course  Have you tried saying it out loud? Hmmm? \"Prego!\" It's fun. Alright fine. Go have some amazing pizza!",

But first I needed to cure my grumps with a bit of caffeine, so I ordered a cappuccino.  Oh. Yes.  I was in cappuccino heaven. Best cappuccino I have had in my life. At that point I was in for a penny, in for a pound.  My friend and I shared the sorrentina (toasted bread with mozzarella, tomatoes, garlic, basil, olive oil), a light start to hold us over while we decided which pizza to try. Once decided, the pizzas come out super-fast. My amatriciana was a little salty, but I chalk that up to the ample amounts of pancetta. The crust was light and chewy and slightly charred, just how I like it! I couldn't eat it all in one sitting though, because there was still dessert to think about.  And another cappuccino to go with it, of course! Happily provided by our lovely and knowledgeable waitress.  A slice of warm chocolate torte and a shot of limoncello to end the evening, and leftover pizza for the morning. Perfect.",

    "text": "Ate here last weekend with my boyfriend and another couple, and we were all very impressed with the quality of food. My boyfriend and I split the margherita pizza and a shrimp and arugula pizza, while our friends split a salad and a pizza with a lot of meat toppings.   The pizza at Pomo is made in the Neapolitan tradition (one of only two pizzerias in Arizona that are certified to do so), so it's crispy on the crust, and soft on the inside. This was especially True of the margherita, which had dough so soft in the middle that paired nicely with the creaminess of the mozarella.   The shrimp and arugula pizza might have been my favorite, however. The dough wasn't quite as soft as the margherita, and the shrimp's flavor was brought out by the arugula.   I had a glass of pinot grigio, which was a little sweeter than my liking, and the rest of the table had beer that was on special -- $2 for watermelon beer! I definitely would recommend ordering some if they still have it, as it was a nice summery treat.   Before we left, one of the owners came by with a shot of this creamy, cinnamon-flavored Everclear, and a plate of fried dough topped with powdered sugar and Nutella. Although this seems to be his schtick with all the diners, it was a sweet and appreciated gesture, not to mention tasty! We had to hang out at the restaurant after drinking the shots because they were a little on the strong side, but so delicious.  The only reason I've docked a star was due to our service. Our server was too attentive -- every couple of minutes she was over to ask how food was/to see if we needed anything, and then when we would tell her we were fine, she would just stand there. Staring at us. For like a minute. So totally bizarre.",

Timing was perfect and both pizza's will make us all come back for more.   Then, the owner came out to the table with a light desert, on the house!

Prices were fair and we really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. I will continue to go back.",

The only reason its 3 stars is that for $18, the pizza was super not filling. It was 12inch, but so thin that i had to go back out and get a second dinner. Dont plan on sharing a pizza from here.",

It had chicken, avocado, pine nuts and a lemon dressing. It was my favorite out of the two. We then had a couple pizzas. I must say that all the ingredients were so fresh. It was really good food. The reason for the four stars was our service. While the food came out timely, the server seemed like she disliked her job. She wasn't very friendly and she was often MIA. Took a while to get our check too. Lastly we got desserts and they were great too! I would definitely go back. Hopefully we have a better waitress next time.",

Its good for casual lunches with out of town guests or romantic date nights.  We have been here several times and have never once had a negative experience.  The only problem is you need to go with a friend who enjoys your taste in pizza so you can split a pizza and salad! (Which is not a bad problem to have!)  Our favorite pizza is the pineapple prosciutto but its only a special and they don't always have it.   I would recommend the PRINCIPE pizza and Romona salad.  As far as pizza goes this is one of the best! (However, as a small side note to out of town guests, if you only have time for one night of pizza in the Phoenix area I would recommend Bianco, Sorry Pomo I still love you! )",

As far as pizza in downtown Phoenix goes, I know everyone loves Pizzeria Bianco.  However,  please try Pomo when you just can't fathom waiting 2 hours to eat.  You will not be disappointed!  The pizza is delicious and the owner is absolutely the nicest guy I have encountered in the restaurant industry.  Like many other reviews here, we received the complimentary Iimoncello and fried bread for dessert. Yum!   The owner overheard me saying to my group that I really wanted a different dessert than what we were going to order.  He came out and surprised me with it for free!   We were all so grateful and impressed- please enjoy this awesome downtown restaurant!  The food is wonderful, and the service is beyond excellent.",

There is a great selection of craft and common beers.  The wine list is impressive too and won't break the bank.  Try the grilled peppers as an appetizer.  May sound simple but very tasty.

The employees here always welcome me and the owner always makes a point to shake my hand and say hi. It does get busy here at times but the service has always been good.

(Don't tell my doctor lol)   I get the cheese pizza and it is simple but soooo gooooooddddd! They closed down the location at the Borgota because the owner of Borgota is moving all the businesses out, tearing it down and building condos. I feel so bad for all of those business owners. But anyways, I went to the location in Phoenix even though it was further because I couldn't resist not having it!  Can't wait until the new one in Scottsdale is open!!!",

They have this cool-looking stove that is kept at such a hot temp, that the pizza cooks in 90 seconds... mind blown.  The pizza - uh! :) Perfect combo of crusty/soft dough, incredible flavor - legitimately different than any pizza I've tasted before.  Then- the complimentary pieces of fried dough (think wonton meets fry bread) dusted with powdered sugar.  So very yum.  I was falling all over myself to the waitstaff about how great everything was & out comes this wonderful man (manager?) with a bottle of homemade Limoncello (liqueur) & hands out shots to my table! Just ridiculous! We floated out of there, yammering on about all the people we were going to convince to go (and take us with them) to this place!  Take your friends, family, go solo - just get there. It's worth the couple bucks more than a chain-pizza place. So very worth it.",

Service was a major let down. Worst part is when a server can't just say sorry about lousy service and timing of food as we watched table after table who say after us get bread, appetizer and then their main dishes.  Pizza earned the seal of approval this place has, thin crust but soft and yet crispy. Will not be back though.",

The pizza was awesome and the salad was a generous size. For the three of us the pizza and salad were enough. The owner then came over and sneakily left a dessert that tasted like a funnel cake in chip form! THEN he brought over a bottle of homemade lemoncello (sp?). It was so good (and strong). Free booze and great pizza makes for a 5 star review.",

We tried the mango salad and a Don Alfonso pizza. Both were great. The pizza's sausage was the star as well as the pizza sauce. The crust was soft with just the right amount of crunch. We followed this up with panna cotta which as a non-dessert person was also great. The crunchy pie crust with powder was exceptional and they gave us extra.  Lastly,  The owner/manager greeted us with a shot each of limonchello and it was terrific.  Couldn't ask for more. Great night. Great dinner.",

    "text": "Brought my dad here for Father's Day lunch. Such an amazing experience!  We started off with a Caprese salad with some of the best mozzarella I've ever had. It came with a few pieces of bread and they bring you a few bottles of different olive oils and balsamic vinegar - all great. I also got an imported blood orange soda that came with the bottle.  We decided to go with the 'meat lovers' style pizza - ham, salami and Italian sausage. It's on a thinner crust cooked in a wood fire brick oven. I love the smokey flavour that adds to it. The sauce was perfect and not too thick and again, amazing quality cheese.  We turned down dessert because we were pretty full but the owner came over to introduce himself and poured us two shots of house-made limoncello and gave us a plate of fried dough with powdered sugar. Both were amazing and it was just so kind! I would definitely order limoncello for myself there again. It was pretty strong but not overwhelming, and I just love lemon and creme. But then when we're just about to leave, he comes over again with two beautiful cherry and chocolate cannoli, saying, \"I can't let you leave without trying my famous cannoli!\" The cannoli filling was perfect and it was such a generous gesture, it made me feel really welcome. I've never had that happen in a restaurant before and you can tell the owner takes pride in what he does.  The pizza, salad, and soda (more than enough food for two) with a generous tip was under $40. Add in the free desert and it's a hell of a great deal.  The background music was also perfect - Sinatra followed by Mumford & Sons followed by Dean Martin? Yes.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I'm so glad it's in downtown Phoenix instead of Scottsdale because I would never have gone!",

    "text": "My search is OVER.......this is by far the BEST, BEST, BEST pizza you can get west of the Mississippi.  Possibly better than my beloved east coast pizza.  The crust is made with love - well taken care of to ensure a consistent thickness all the way around.  No giant burnt bubbles and thick on one slice and paper thin on the other......not good eats.  The texture - OMG - ridiculously light and soft on the inside and ever so slightly crunchy on the outside. Crazy Good!  The sauce is what pizza sauce is supposed to be - light but tastes like actual tomatoes - not ketchup.  Oh the cheese.......we had the classic Regina Margherita and the Peppino which has ricotta (rigawt as we say on the east coast) and salami (pepperoni).  The cheese sat on the pizza like a favorite flashy accessory and the taste was fresh and phenomenal.  The chef brought out their hot pepper oil and grated parmesan and oregano which yes I used that oil for crust dipping! Aside from the food - service was fantastic.  The server and the hostess were very pleasant and attentive but not buggy.  After inhaling our pizzas, the chef came out and gave us a plate of fried thin pizza dough covered with powdered and two chilled shot glasses of some very proudly house made limoncello creme.  I would buy a gallon of this drink if it was available.  After all that pleasant food worshiping, I HAD to have their cannolis.  I am very critical of cannolis and their filling.  The filling was firm but soft and full of flavor.  Presentation was lovely as well.  I can only say if you have a hankering for REAL pizza, come to Pomo and support a local business that brings pizza happiness to Phoenix and to all who visit.  You will NOT be disappointed.",

    "text": "Came here on a random Friday night after bookmarking it awhile ago after seeing the glowing reviews. When we pulled up via pedicab, we realized this was the place they had been working on the last time we ventured into SquashBlossom. The patio area looked nice but it was way too hot that night to sit outside so we opted for the dinning room.  When we walked in, the place was nearly full but we were greeted and sat near the back wall at a small table. Our waitress was friendly and we both ordered cocktails that were really good. We opted to get the Focaccia bread as an appetizer and then share the Mango Salad and Peppino pizza. I requested that the Mango salad be made with other greens besides arugula. As I mentioned in the Zpizza review, since when has this crappy, peppery green become so fashionable?!?! If I want my salad to taste like an herb, I'll add it, thank you very much. When I asked for a substitution with one of the other greens listed on the menu, our waitress said they couldn't really do it, that the salads were pre-made. I probably should have opted for a different salad but she said it was a blend so I thought I could probably overlook it if there wasn't a lot of it.  We received a basket of bread that was just okay in flavor. It was nice and soft though and at first I thought it was the Focaccia appetizer but then it arrived, nearly taking up our whole table! It wasn't quite what I had expected though. It was definitely flatbread that had been baked but the waitress advertised it as being able to be dipped in their homemade vinegar and oil. That's what sold me on it so I had expected some bread that actually soaked up the oil. If you've ever had a salad at Gelato spot, it was a lot like their bread under their salads. Picture a really big, baked tortilla. There's not a lot there to soak up anything.   Our salad came out next. Sadly, 10% was baby lettuce and the rest arugula. Everything else on this salad was really good but the arugula overpowered every other flavor. I wouldn't get it again and it would be nice if restaurants stopped serving this crap but I digress...  By the time we were done with our salads, our table was overflowing with dishes, drinks, bread, appetizers, water glasses, oils. It was almost claustrophobic. We ended up setting several things on the floor so we didn't dump anything. The place is tiny so they can't have massive tables but it would be helpful if the staff paid a bit more attention to how much they put on our table and keeping it clear.   Now for the reason for the 4 stars. The PIZZA. It was sooooo good. Everything was super fresh. The cheese, the ricotta, the sauce, the sausage! This was probably the best tasting sausage I've ever had on a pizza. We devoured the entire thing like it was going to be snatched from us at any moment. It blows Pizzeria Bianco out of the water and eases out over Cibo with the crust and sauce and toppings just slightly.  Once we sufficiently stuffed ourselves with pizza, the head chef came by our table and gave us each a shot of Limoncello that was super strong and really good and some odd fried dough of some sort with powdered sugar. All compliments of the house. The dough was tasteless though so maybe they were just trying to give it away? I do appreciate the effort though. The chef was nice enough to bring it over but definitely wasn't overly friendly, smile or even thanked us for our business.   Even after all the other faults of this place, I'm still thinking about that pizza and its been a few weeks since we visited. I'll have no problem going back. Hopefully very soon!",

    "text": "I can't in good faith give this place more than 3 stars. I'm actually pretty surprised there are so many 5 star reviews. Nevertheless here is my opinion and experience here.   We arrived right when they opened at 11 and put enough money in the meter for an hour and fifteen minutes. All the while my boyfriend laughed at me for wasting my change on being over zealous. We were the only guests thus far and were seated right away. Everything was clean and nice as far as tables, chairs and decor.   We got 2 waitresses as one was training. Having never been here we decided to try the meat, cheese, and olive platter. I was excited for it to bring back memories of my grand parents from Sicily. We waited, and waited, and another table was seated next to us. We waited some more and our waitresses returned to take our main course order. We were told to try the margarita pizza and regaled with tales of being certified all the way from Italy itself, which I can only assume, is the justification for the pricing. The sauce is even out of a jar shipped all the way from Italy itself. However, our pizza would supposedly be cooked in sixty to ninety seconds (yes, that's what she said) so at least we wouldn't be waiting?   Finally our appetizer arrived with paper thin (warm) bread. The bread was inviting and the olives were great. That's about all the praise I can dish out for the meat tray. Even my boyfriend who, being a typical American male, lives for meat and cheese trays, was disappointed. Granted it was a lot of food. There wasn't enough bread for the whole tray. So if you're a party you might want to ask for extra bread if you decide on this lack luster adventure.   By this time the restaurant had filled and tables around us were chattering away and eating. Yet we sat, and sat. About 45 minutes after we arrived our pizza came to the table, while everyone around us was finishing their lunch.   I will be honest. It looked sad. Sauce everywhere, barely any cheese, and small pieces of basil that adorned 2.5 slices of the 6. I stared at it for a few minutes before taking a slice and trying a bite. My fears were substantiated tasting sauce out of a can or jar that had traveled half way around the world on a barge, probably next to a container of leather flip flops, and crates of Nutella.   I learned to make a five hour sauce from my grandmother. I'm quite frankly appalled that a self proclaimed Italian pizzeria is not making their own sauce.   Five minutes after our pizza arrived a man came and put a container of cheese an oregano on the table. My boyfriend dumped some cheese on his slice and said \"try some, it'll help.\" I tried and decided it was no use.   For dessert we tried the Nutella cake. While it didn't taste much like Nutella (more chocolate), the strawberries and whipped cream were phenomenal.   I can't say that I'd make the trek again for strawberries and whipped cream. If we return it'll be for sauce less pizza only.",

This place offered up a great dinner experience a deux for hubby and I.  The Margherita pizza was simple...and simply delicious. We shared one pie and a salad, and then a slice of the Hazelnut Torte cake. Yummmm. The waitress was knowledgeable about the wine list and suggested two reds that we also really liked.  After our meal, the chef brought us a special (and unexpected) treat...homemade limoncello shots and powdered sugar-coated crispy dessert bites.  After a meal like this, the only thing I was left craving was a spin on a Vespa!",

We went back the next weekend.   Food: Best Neapolitan pizza in the valley. The real deal tomatoes. We used to drive all the way to downtown Glendale to go to another famous pizza place (the only other one in the valley area with certified tomatoes besides this one) and this place blows them out of the water.

Erica was a great server - friendly, attentive, and helpful throughout the entire meal. The best part - after finishing my 12\" Pomo pizza (delicious, and more than enough for one person) and Peroni, Chef Matteo brought a plate of Italian fried dough and a shot of his homemade limoncello - on the house.  I was in and out in less than an hour (because I had to get back to a seminar), but would have gladly ordered another drink and enjoyed the friendly atmosphere if I had more time.

I had the Don Alfonso, with sausage, red peppers, and salame piccante ferrarini. It was fantastic. Every element was extremely high quality. The pizza was flawless and delicious.  I had come in after 1:30, so the place was quiet and I got to interact with the owner. He was extremely friendly. At the end of the meal, he brought some free dessert -- they were flaky, crispy frybread-like things, dusted with powdered sugar. Excellent. (Sorry I don't remember the name of the pastry.)  For me, it helps to place them on a scale compared to other gourmet pizza restaurants. Here's the breakdown: Pomo is better than The Parlor, Il Bosco (in Scottsdale), and Hungry Pie (Scottsdale).  The only places that could compete with Pomo are Bianco and Piazza al Forno in Glendale. It's been so long since I've been to Bianco that I just don't know - I'd need to go there again. Piazza al Forno is the only place where I remember feeling the way I did when I was Pomo - where I was hit by a train, where my life was interrupted by this sense of \"Holy shit, this is not a normal Phoenix upscale hipster pizza place (which are, admittedly, pretty good). This is a whole different ride.\"",

I had called earlier in the day to get directions and parking information. The woman on the phone was just so wonderful and friendly. I was happy that my first impression was starting out just great. From the moment we walked in we were made to feel like family.  As an Italian restaurant should and is usually so good at. (Hint, hint to other vendors in town) The pizza here is totally, radically delish and I am very picky about Pizza. Pomo's is one of only two places in town to be certified in the making of authentic Italian style Napoletana pizza. Even with the burnt crust, which I am never a fan of, the pizza was still wonderful.      We also ordered the Flatbread App ( Loaded with garlic and the size of a pizza, so heads up) and the Caprese Salad ( Delish). For dessert we ordered The Tiramisu, and the Creme Puffs with Mousse. The Creme Puffs were light and airy and yummy.  The Tiramisu was one of the best two I have ever had. I have eaten a lot in my life since it is my favorite dessert.      Now the impressive part to make me homesick.  As we were sitting and digesting our carb load and contemplating a roll out to my car one of the owners came to our table to say hi. Besides being an extremely handsome Italian, friendly, and chatty he had a bottle of Limoncello in his hands. My version of the perfect man. Hello, but I digress. He served us complimentary shots of their version of Limoncello.  It has an Icee creamy texture to it. It took me a minute and a few tries but in the end I decided I liked it very much despite the unusual texture for this drink. It was very inventive and I love food inventions/experimentation. I believe he said he adds heavy cream and some other ingredient to it to make it thicker. He also gave us a sample of deep friend dough strips with powered sugar. it was kind of like a Zeppole but flatter and harder. The owner walked the floor chatting with his guests making them feel at home. Now that is the type of Italian restaurant I remember from the old neighborhood.",

    "text": "While I think it really bites that their original spot had to relocate because a famous place is being torn down for yet another set of luxury apartments, I am SUPER glad that downtown Phoenix gained another fantastic locally owned spot to nosh at!    This is only one of 2 places that is certified (not sure what the term is) as a genuine and authentic Napoletena-style pizza restaurant.  Apparently, it even comes down to the type of marble they use to make their dough on.  Seriously cool!    The owners are from Naples and have definitely brought a taste of Italy to Phoenix.  While we were there, one of the co-owners was in working and walking around. In fact, he brought some of his homemade blend of a creamy Limoncello to us to try and some friend dough.  Talk about a great dining experience!    My friend had the caprese to start with and she loooooved it!  We ordered the margherita pizza which is one of about 3 or 4 genuine Neopolitan pizzas they serve.  Sweet jesus!  The sauce was perfect, the crust was the right consistency (could have done without the overcooked spots in the crust though), and the mozarella was mmmm mmmm good! I ordered what I thought was an appetizer flat bread, but it turned out to be the same size as the pizza (it was super rich...a little too much garlic, but delicious nonetheless).  There was plenty to go around and enough for leftovers to take home too.  For dessert we had their Tiramisu, which my friend boasted as being the best she has had in the valley (and she has tried it every where).  I had their cream puffs that are covered in chocolate mousse.  Wipe the drool off your chin.  Both were fantastic, but I wish I'd have gone with my first instinct and had their Nutella cake after spotting their GIGANTIC jar of Nutella in the kitchen.    I'll definitely be back and bringing other friends with me to try it out AND so I can have that cake!!",

The place is tiny. dark and was empty that night.

Decor is nice and outdoor space is perfect for lovely weather. Service was quick and pleasant, even with a personal run through of the menu. My Margherita pizza came out in under 5 minutes and was bigger than the plate it was served on. I was told since the dough is thin it's not all that scary to eat but decided to eat half and save room for dessert. Before dessert came out, the chef brought out a mini dessert of fried dough and powered sugar. Simple yet waited for my cake. Sooo glad I did, the nutella torta was AMAZING!

The grand ah factor is there massive handmade charcoal brick oven they cook their pizza in.

Very fresh toppings and tons of variety in the menu to choose from. Only con was that my mushrooms were slightly overcooked/soggy. The crispy but soft and slightly charred crust was heaven and you could tell the cheese was high quality because it was not over oily like most cheap quality pizza. I was very pleased.  The cherry on top was the homemade tiramisu. 2 Best I ever hads in one place...wow! The owner also tends to come around the tables and offer homemade limoncello shots and thank you for coming to his restaurant.

I keep finding excellent pizza joints and am loving every minute of it!  I decided to head down this way today and try out Pomo.  The reviews looked great, and it was one that I had bookmarked too.  Win, win.  I drove down, parked in the lot next to it ($2.00 an hour) and walked over.  I was the first person in the joint at about 11:30am.  I was greeted by the hostess and asked where I wanted to sit.  It was nice out, so I decided to sit out on the patio.  I had a water to drink and then I placed my order for a Regina Margherita.  The first time at a new pizza spot,  I always go with a plain cheese pizza.  If their plain cheese pizza is good, you know the rest of their stuff is going to be good!  Here is how it was..............  Regina Margherita Pizza ($11.95)-  This pizza looked great!  I'm becoming a huge fan of the Napoletana style pizza.  Wood fired oven, cooked quick (less than 2 minutes usually) and it makes one hell of a tasty pizza.  This pizza was simple and delicious.   Right away I noticed that it had plenty of cheese.  My first bite in, I tasted one of the creamiest cheeses I have ever had.  It was great!  The sauce was nice and mellow, the basil was fragrant and delicious and the crust was fantastic!  The bottom of the crust was nice and charred and blistered.  The crust around the edges was charred nicely yet still soft and chewy.  The middle was just a tad soggy (it's normal with these type of pizzas) but I could still pick it up, fold a slice and eat it.  No knife and fork needed.  I devoured that pizza in record time.  It was absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to try out some of their other offerings.    When I was done with my meal, the pizza cook? brought out a plate of complimentary fried dough with powdered sugar.  It was a fitting ending to the meal.  The little strips of dough reminded me of fried won tons.  They were light and delicate and just sweet enough from the powdered sugar.  Nice gesture and it was appreciated!  I only have two things bad to say about this place....both of them were based on the fact that I sat outside.  There were quite a few flies.  Understandable because I am outside, but there were more than normal.  Maybe get some fly traps or supersonic bug zappers or something.  The only other slight gripe is that if you sit outside, there is a bar next door.  People were smoking out there and the smoke blew downwind over towards my way.  No fault of Pomos, just a heads up.  If you don't appreciate smoke, I would sit inside just in case.  Service was great and every employee I encountered had a smile on their face!  If I am downtown, I know where to come for some great pizza!   It was fantastic and I left very full and very impressed!  I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Pomo is hands down the ONE pizza that I crave with a vengeance. About a year ago I set out to try other up and coming pizzerias in the valley and try my own sort of self proving standard against what I thought was the ultimate high bar that Pomo had unknowingly set.. a complete ten on the pizza level in my world of taste buds. I have yet to find it here. There are some truly great pizzerias here in Phoenix and Scottsdale, don't get me wrong! BUT none of them compare to Pomo. The crust is what makes the pizza here so delightfully perfect in ones mouth! The crust on every pizza I've had here has an authenticity hard to find outside of Italy. Oh wait!  They have that special authentic Naples seal, after all!:  The APN, Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani and the VPN , Verace Pizza Napoletana. Do the research on those earned and coveted culinary seals and you will see that they are True Naples, Italy certifications for amazing! My very favorite pizza is the Pizza Chef. A white pie of prosciutto, basil, mushrooms, parma cheese and crema all topped on that amazing crust that is perfect and crisp to the bite. AND, I can't resist always starting with the Affettati Misti, Pomo's charcuterie and Italian cheese board that comes olives and their amazing house made bread. Don't be taken aback if you find yourself having to wait for a table. You likely will. While you wait, Pomo has a great, yet small, bar and an amazing bartender too. David will figure out your wants for libations and make sure you are happy ! The wine list is awesome here. The Italian cocktails are unique and fresh. Who doesn't like an Italian mojito because it has prosecco added?! The patio here is fun and dog friendly; there are sometimes Italian Vespas parked out front to look at .. or jazz up your Instagram feed! Sometimes after perusing the PHX Public Market, I have found myself on the Pomo patio for an afternoon cocktail and lunch! I have always been too full to partake in any of the desserts here at Pomo.. I keep promising myself to box up some of the pizza and order a Panna Cotta! Know that you will be treated very well by Pomo staff and the management, as well. If you are here in the evening, it is not out of the ordinary to get a gratis Limoncello to top off your amazing meal. It is house made and served in a shot glass. Not to be taken like a shot because it is to be savored like the delight it is: lemony and creamy. The fried pieces of dough doused in sweet sugar are pretty good to finish off the meal too. The vibe here is friendly, fun and trendy. Worth the wait for amazing pizza! My very favorite pizza quite possibly.. outside of Italy! Whats better .. they are legit Italians here!",

The staff was very friendly and provided great service and recommendations.  Everything about this place oozes authenticity, from all of the italian the staff was speakign to the little scooters out front to the compliementary powdered dough with sugar and limoncellos after the meal.

Pomo pizzeria is the real deal with lots of authentic Italian ingredients & flavors. Any place that serves oregano in a shaker on the table is authentic Italian.   We were disappointed that the Sicilian arancini is not served at the downtown location, but settled for the Mista salad, which is a perfect, light starter. The owner dropped off a thick balsamic vinegar to add to it... divine.   For the main course, we ordered our standard - the Bufala Verace (basically Margherita with Bufula mozzarella). And it was fantastic, must order this! We also ordered the Cappiccosa - also delicious, but one slice was enough for me, and I was back to the Bufula.  Sauce is generous, but not excessive. Crust is thin & light, but thick enough to hold the slice & eat without knife & fork.   The native Italian staff was friendly and the Southern Italian owner delivering the complimentary crisps & limoncello (best we've ever had, by the way) really put a nice finishing touch on our meal.",

First, we asked for water because we were super thirsty, but my boyfriend pointed out all the crap that was in it, little black peices that looked like dead bugs to me.

The advantage of coming late is free parking and no need to circle endlessly to locate a parking space. It can be such a nightmare finding parking spaces in downtown Phoenix.     I think the restaurant is smaller than the Scottsdale location. There were a few of large parties that night.  Luckily, we found a table near the door.  It wasn't the most ideal table since you can feel the heat from outside.    Service wasn't too attentive that night.  We had a hard time finding our Waitress after placing our orders. A friend actually asked if the owner worked here, lol.  The Bartender was awesome tho!          We had ordered a few POMO classic pizzas, Capricciosa, Pomo, and Regina margherita. I have been craving for more slices since they were at the Yelp's Downtown Revival. Kids had their cheese pizza. They wanted pepperoni but wasn't listed on the menu.  If you ask, they will customize it for you.  It came as the same as the Regina Margherita but just with pepperoni thrown on top.  Who needs to wait forever at Pizzeria Bianco when you can still have fresh wood-fired oven pizza at POMO.  I'm glad they opened another location in dt Phoenix.   My sister and a friend ordered the mojito.  I got a sip of the drink.  It was on the sweeter side but still refreshing and delicious.  I would order it next time. Caution if you are lightweight drinker, consider sharing the mojito.",

My mother is from Switzerland, and desserts I grew up with are not sugary sweet.

Now keep in mind this is a smaller restaurant, and is a very popping downtown spot; so you may want make a reservation.  If your having a cocktail at a bar, and decide you don't want to cook, or wait for seating....well fret not my friends, and use the door-dash app to place a pickup order on your way home.  Then go home, enjoy that food, indulge in that desert in pajamas while binge watching Sabrina on Netflix.  YOU deserve it after a hard working week.",

Other than that it was an overall nice experience.",

There was nothing like it. When ever my girlfriend and I had a soup craving we came down for this.   Next was porcine mushrooms. The finest mushroom IMO, and a topping that took their pizza to the next level.   I pray this isn't a sign of cost cutting and the beginning of a downward slide. But honestly without this items we probably won't be coming by anytime soon.",

    "text": "We came into Pomo Pizzeria with the highest expectations - it's a popular pizza destination in Phoenix and I have had numerous people tell me that it is their favorite pizza place in the valley. On the Sunday we came in, they were having their soft opening. The service was particularly slow but we figured they were just very short staffed.  For appetizers, we had the polpette-meatballs. They were good, but I've definitely had better. For my main dish, I ordered the carbonara and unfortunately did not like it at all. There was something off about the taste. Everyone tasted this dish and agreed with me. I ended up eating my boyfriend's spaghetti which he absolutely hated. I thought it was okay - way better than my carbonara. He ended up ordering another dish (lasagna al forno) and to our extreme disappointment, it was terrible. It was very overcooked and looked like mush. I had a slice of the Pomo Pizza and thought it was delicious.   Our server was very busy - I saw that he was also making the cocktails himself. Like I said, the service was very slow but they did seem like they were very understaffed. This is also what I blame the mediocre food on. I've had Pomo's pasta before through Uber eats (including their strozzapreti) and I have always loved it each time. Our server was wonderful enough to take the pasta out of our bill. I'm hoping this was a fluke because I would love to come back and try this place out again.",

We opened the box when we got back to our AirBnb 5 minutes later to discover the pizza was barely lukewarm. When I picked up my first slice, it completely flopped. The crust tasted great, but the rest of the pie was terribly soggy. Even trying to fold it in half didn't help. The flavors seemed like they would be tasty, if warm.  I called and talked to the manager. She offered to remake the pizza, but I declined. (Long, long day of travel, and I didn't feel like going out again.) She then immediately offered me a credit, which I accepted.  I might give them a try next time I'm in Phoenix, but I will definitely eat in rather than carry out.",

(Although I didn't eat my whole pie in one sitting, the bf scarfed down his Margherita pizza very quickly!)  As we were paying the check, the owner(?), who has a fantastic Italian accent, surprised us by bringing over a small plate of powdered sugar covered pieces of fried dough (I have no idea what they're called) and a shot of homemade limoncello for each of us.  Fantastic!  The limoncello was the perfect way to top off a great experience!  We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Great pizza. Good service! Got the del duca and the quatro stagioni. The waitress said we could eat a pizza each but 2 people could share one. We both had lots of leftovers. I guess it depends how hungry you are but an entire pizza each seems a bit much.   Nice touch on the free limoncello and pastries mentioned in other reviews at dessert. We didn't have room for any of the other desserts!   Pay parking although I think it is free on Sunday...we paid anyway since we were not sure but it was only 5 dollars expiring at 10pm so was good. We sat on the patio which was hot until the sun went down but not much of a view. There was no room inside at the time...  Worth the trip!",

    "text": "Had a tough day and I wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner. I drove to the downtown location, rather than the Glendale location, based on the reviews I read here. Big mistake. First, you have to pay for parking downtown. Even on the weekends and evenings. Second, even though the restaurant was mostly empty, they had no less than 6 employees on staff, each given a specific task. The person that greets you, seats you and gives you menu's. The busboy brings you water. The waitress takes your drink order and comes back with the drinks and then left us far too long before coming back to take our dinner order. The folks behind the counter seem to pour the drinks and make the food.  Our food was delivered to our table by the folks behind the counter. The waitress seems to have it pretty easy here compared to the typical duties of a waitress at just about any other restaurant, which is why it's hard for me to understand why we were never visited again by our waitress during our meal. She was too busy chatting it up with a couple seated at the bar. I glanced her way and stared several times, hoping to get her attention because my drink was empty and I'm basically choking down dry bread. My meal has to stop until I can get something to wash my food down with. I give up, I get up with my empty drink and I take it to the counter. The man behind the counter knows what I was drinking and offers to refill it and bring it back out to me.  Suddenly, lo-and-behold, our waitress appears. Why our waitress was so inattentive and couldn't take a 2 minute break from her conversation to check on her table (and then she could go back to her conversation) is beyond mind boggling to me.  Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered the Romana salad, which was way over-priced for what you get at $9.95. It's basically some lettuce, crutons and salad dressing. Not much to making it, not much to it at all.  I also ordered the Regina Margherita pizza ($12.95) and my drink, a Coke, at $2.50. These are not cheap prices and the level of service should be equal.  There were flies buzzing all around our table, so I wish I would have sat outside.   The pizza was good, but the tomato sauce was a bit too 'sharp' for my taste.   There is another, similar restaurant called La Piazza Al Forno. They also have locations in downtown Phoenix and Glendale. They are also VPN certified, and I think the menu has more variety, cheaper prices, and, in my experience, much better service.  The excuse offered to me regarding my waitresses inattentiveness was that she was quitting her job in a couple of days and was saying goodbye to some regular customers. Again, she didn't have to stop talking to them, she just needed to excuse herself for two minutes to check on other customers. Its unlikely I'll become a regular customer, in part, because the waitress left me feeling alienated, or less important.  The total was $25.40 with $2.11 tax for a grand total of $27.51. A 10% tip on the pretax total would have been $2.54. If I was taken care of, I would have left $6, but since I got irritated for being ignored, I left her $3.00, which considering the circumstances, I thought was generous of me.  Everyone has a limited job to do. The cooks did a good job. The greeter did a good job. The busboy did a good job. I'd go so far to say this restaurant doesn't need waitresses. She was the only one who screwed up, and all she had to do was check in on us from time to time. I think the folks behind the bar could have easily done her job and she would be free to talk to her friends all day, every day. The customer would be taken care of and everyone would be happy. its a win-win-win situation. I cannot emphasize enough how easy the wait-staff has it at this location.  As for any after dinner treats delivered to your table after the meal (again, based on reviews I read here), I didn't get that. I got a bill. The waitress was fast to deliver the bill and to check back to collect the bill and deliver the receipt. Noted.  I found the food here to be good but over-priced and La Piazza Al Forno to offer similar food, that I think tastes better, at a cheaper price and with much better service.",

They don't take reservations but we were able to be seated right away. Peroni on tap was a plus. :) We started with the caprese and split the peppino pizza. I highly recommend the peppino!! A little sausage ricotta perfection! :) Most of the other guest ordered one pizza per person but one was enough for us. My hubby could have ordered more so if your hungry you might want you own pie. After dinner the offered some complimentary limoncello. It tasted like sweet lemon candy! Sooo good! Try this place out! It's great!",

The food is as close to some of the traditional Italian places I've been as anywhere I've discovered in Arizona. The staff is helpful. (And by helpful I mean helpful. The male bartender with long ponytailed hair was super patient while two customers flipped through their phones to show him pictures of pizzas they liked from other restaurants. Like, really guys?) plus anywhere that gives you a complimentary shot and sweets after your meal is a instant thumbs up.",

We were amazed at the freshness and authenticity of food. To finish it off, the owner (presumably) offered us grain alcohol to go with crispy powered sugared wafers. These were complementary.

I've never been, but I would bet that the experience here is 99% close. We came in with a 30-40 min wait around 8pm on a Friday night  (justifying their popularity) but opted for the bar to be seated right away. And so glad we did because our bartender, David was fantastic. He made us feel right at home. We started with the bruschetta and it seemed to come out as soon as we ordered it! Per our bartender's recommendation, we tried the Principa pizza (prosciutto, arugula wonderful tomato and cheese blend) and it was perfection from toppings to crust. We had already had a small meal at a food truck beforehand and didn't expect to finish but we killed it. After paying, we were surprised by the complimentary fried dough/powdered sugar dessert. It was a simple yet satisfying ending to a wonderful meal. I cannot wait to go here again!! Congrats to Glendale & Gilbert for soon getting their own Pomo!",

They present it nicely on a large plate and then bring out everything an Italian or non-Italian could want to add to their pizza -- red pepper, oregano, parm, and I think a spicy olive oil.  The pizza was extremely tasty without any of that, but because I always know better than everyone else (even the chef), I went and made it even better :)  My dinner companion (my mommy) had the Pomo.  It was the typical supreme- type ingredients (S, M, O, G)... and while I didnt taste her pizza, I did hear one of the most negative people I know only say good things about it... so it musta beena gooda!  And sorry about that last comment, mom!  As for the canoli, well, not as great as the pizza by any means... but who am I to knock off a star because the dessert couldn't measure up to the wonderfulness of the main entree.  I wouldn't get the canoli (actually three little canolis) again, but they had a bunch of other desserts worth trying.",

This mid range pizzeria looks OK from the outside. The place was half full on a Sunday evening and we were seated immediately.   The menu is short and dominated by Pizza. You could choose a salad or a swordfish steak but the oven in the corner of the main dining area gives you a big hint on what you should be ordering. The drinks menu is dominated by Italian wine. There is also the pleasant addition of six draft beers.  We all stuck with pizza - a 12\" thin crust individual serving. Bellissimo! The base was almost as good as you would find in Naples, itself; the tomato sauce was natually sweet and the salami picante. We had made the most of Pheonix's dining options and had expected to be taking home doggy bags but, blink and the last slice was long gone.  The service is as you would expect from a place that is $25 a head. Our waitress kept an eye on us without being overbearing. The manager came out after the meal and gave us two rounds of home made shots.  Is it the best restaurant in Phoenix? Not sure about it, but Pomo is correctly highly rated. It gives you relaxed dining and great Pizza in Downtown Phoenix.",

Well, yes it could, if the Suns were in the playoff, it definitely would be better (there's always next year).  I've wanted to check out this place for awhile, as it was recommended by a few fellow yelpers and since I had it bookmarked, was in the area, and I joyfully discovered their Happy Hour was still going on until 7pm...Score, as it was just 6pm, and most HH were over! So, I strolled in, and was promptly greeted, but all the bar seating was occupied, and since I was flying solo, they were going to toss me outside, but David, my capable host offered the outdoor bar seating, where he would be more than happy to open up the overhead, and allow me to enjoy the outdoors, and still feel a part of the indoor scene and catch the game. I accepted his offer as he promptly brought me menus galore...hey I just need pizza, \"what's popular\"?, I asked.  The \"meat lovers\" David identified as his go-to, and also a house favorite, so it's what I went with. The standard fare of silverware, a napkin, plate and acumens were brought out while I waited, and a wonderful tall glass of water was delivered without me having to even ask. The Toto Sapore had a load of flavor, not too cheesy, crunchy, not too thin, flavorful crust, and it came out quick, too! I also ordered a pint of the Devil's Ale, and I'm usually half way done with a brew before my pizza arrives, but not here, Wow!! Only a few swigs and I was being served...this, my first visit I just hope they're not spoiling this pizza/beer lover, but I think not.  I tend to equalize my beer consumption with beer intake, and usually polish off two pints, but because my pie came out so quickly, I almost finished it off before the first ale was consumed. Good thing, too, for I didn't want to stay for a second round, but was really enjoying the atmosphere and late spring weather. By the time I finished over two-thirds of my Toto Sapore, my glass was empty, my belly full, and I was a happy guy, and very satisfied customer. I will be back for more very soon.",

    "text": "Racism in America!!!  Went to try out their pizza as I read an article about this restaurant and it seemed to be pretty busy, so I was thinking good sign right? If it's busy it has to be great food. Well we walked in and approached the hostess and I said \"table for two please\". She and I seemed to browse the selection of seating at the same time and I saw a table for two open in the back and thought, \"awesome an open table!\" Nope, to my surprise the hostess turns to us and states, \"it's going to be 35-45 min wait unless you would like to sit at the bar or outside.\" Well it's 100 degrees outside, so that's not an option and the bar was pretty crowded as it was so, I looked at my husband and he nodded no, so I said, \"that's okay thank you.\" There were two other restaurants in the plaza so we went to check them out and there was no waiting but that also means the food may not be very good. I said to my husband, maybe we should go and just wait our time out for the pizza cause it's got to be good if there's a wait versus a the two restaurants that are virtual ghost towns. So we wander back into the Pizzeria and by now there is a couple that had walked in right before us. It's literally been 2-3 minutes that has passed. I thought great the wait may be longer now but our loss, our fault. We walk inside to stand behind the couple to place our names back on the list and was very surprised when the hostess grabbed two menus and proceeds to lead them to the very same table I saw was open merely minutes before. So by this time I am completely confused as to why we would have not been seated at the table. So the hostess turns to us as she walks back to the hostess podium and has a look as though she had just been caught doing something naughty but I dismiss the weird look and I said, \"we are back.\" She said, \"oh okay it won't be long probably 20 minutes.\" I said okay we will wait and there was a table that needed to be cleared so I thought, surely we will be seated momentarily. My husband and I go to wait outside as there is little space in the entrance and a woman pushing a wheelchair and an older gentlemen walk up to the entrance and I go to open the door for them and pleasantries are exchanged. I turn back to my husband as he tells me, \"I cannot believe that just happened, can we just go?\" I said, \"let's wait a moment there's a table opening up and I would like to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt as this type of racism can't still blatantly litter our community. I would like to see if we get seated before the party that just arrived.\" My husband just nods his head and we watch in wonder as the hostess picks up 3 menus and led them to the table that opened up. So it's probably not hard to guess at this point that either my husband or I are minorities. My husband is black and I am Amerasian. The couple was Caucasian, as were the party of three. Needless to say my husband and I left and will not grace our presence at this establishment's doorstep again!!!! Shame on you for allowing such a practice at your place if business!! At one time your ancestors were the minority, but you must have forgotten that part of Americas's noble history!!!!!",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice now, both with a small group. Both visits food, service, and atmosphere were solid. It's a small restaurant so I would definitely recommend reservations for a group of 6 or more.   Both visits I ordered the vegetarian pizza. Which is amazing! The crust is thin and flakey with the perfect amount of cheese and veggies. Even the non-vegetarians at my table thought it was better than the meat pizza! Someone at the table ordered the eggplant parmesan, thankfully they were willing to share because it was probably one of the best I've had. It wasn't too stringy or firm but cooked just right.   Our server was excellent, attentive but never bothersome. The restaurant was even so kind as to pour our table shots of their homemade limencello at the end of our meal. It was a welcome surprise. It tasted creamy, tangy and delicious!   After telling a friend how amazing the restaurant was we looked up their additional locations and was so excited to see they are expanding around the Phoenix area and have another location closer to home. We will definitely be back!",

The crispy crust made the perfect balance of a saucy masterpiece. Flowing cheese grazed my chin as I embrace this rich experience! I'm still infatuated as I eat the last bite. Sadly-(sigh). I might also mention the fabulous soup and enthusiasm of the service of Selenae, our server. Her intuitive manner satisfied our every desire and whim. Wow!

    "text": "*NOTE TO WARY FOODIES : GREAT PIZZA COMES WITH  A PRICE* Sometimes you just need a good slice (...or eight).   Slowrise sourdough crust cooked in a wood burning oven (\"This gives the pizza a soft and digestible crust\", says the menu...thank goodness, it's digestible!).  We decided to order one \"Classica\" (thin crust) and one Focaccia (yummy puffy focaccia crust!): Classica Contadina (Red Bell Pepper * Onions * Gaeta Olive * Artichoke * Mushroom $14) Focaccia Carbonara (Fior di Latte * Eggs * Pancetta (Bacon) * Onion * Panna * Pecorino Romano $15).  Trying to stick to my Veg-kick, I requested that the chef remove the Pancetta from half of 'za.  The waitress confirmed that this request was fine, but the Pancetta + onion were mixed together...leaving me with a pretty bare pizza.  \"Could I have sliced tomato +olives instead of the onion+Pancetta?\" - \"Sure!\" - \"Excellent!\"  When the 12-inchers arrived - piping hot and smelling like discs of heaven - We dug RIGHT in.  Let me tell you - - - some of the BEST pizza I've had; that Carbonara was right up my crooked alley.  Eggs on a pizza, sprinkled with freshly grated Peccorino, prepare for flavor explosion.  SO good, in fact, thaaaaattttt maybe (just perhaps) I umm....are one square foot of the stuff. *belch*  NOTE: *one* of the olives had a pit which I almost cracked my tooth on...  As the evening waned on, we sat back and relaxed and just enjoyed the conversation.  After about 20 minutes, the owner delivered crispy dough pieces dusted with powdered sugar (then slipped away without a word).  These were delicious, and I cannot believe that I could consume more food!  More time, more conversation, and the owner returned again, this time delivering two chilled shot glasses which he topped off with Crema di Limoncello!!  He bowed slightly, and whispered \"Salute\" (then slipped away).   We were left to enjoy our crisps and 'cello under the evening protection of heat lamps - - - it was pretty great!  *IF YOU ENJOY DRIFTING IN THE REALM OF THE BLISSFULLY UNINFORMED FOODIE, YOU MAY WANT TO STOP READING NOW....*  Because this is here's where it got hairy...  The check stated \"1/2 Roma Tomatoes $3\" and \"Open FOOD $3\" (I've added an image of this).  When our waitress returned for payment.  I asked her, \"What is this charge for 'Open FOOD $3'?\" - she shook her head, took the check, and returned back to her manager to ask.  Moments later, we were visited by the GM.  \"I'm so sorry, but my hands are tied!\"  He was charming, and kind, and seemed like the kind of person whom  would be really fun to grab a drink with! ....but he essentially said that he wouldn't void the charge, because then *he'd* be in hot water (not really a \"good\" reason to deny this request).  This meant that our $15 12\" pizza was really a **$21** 12\" pizza...just because I'm a vegetarian who didn't want Pancetta and was not informed that the addition of sliced tomato & olives would result in a RIDICULOUS markup...  INSANELY good pizza.....but, sheesh...what a womper.",

We were there last week with some friends, I love Italian food and my husband keeps raving about this place so we gave it a go.    I ordered carbonara.  You know, the pasta.  It's on the \"pasta\" section and I didn't see any \"carbonara style pizza\".  Fifteen minutes later, the server gives me \"carbonara pizza\", so I said, \"Oh I wanted the pasta\".  The server goes, \"Oh we don't have that, we ran out of eggs\".  BUT, the funny thing was the carbonara pizza was covered in eggs! Scrambled eggs.  It literally tasted like scrambled egg pizza. Also, I've never heard of carbonara pizza.  That's equivalent to me asking for spaghetti, and getting spaghetti pizza instead because they're out of spaghetti sauce.  I am very disappointed. The pizza was gross.  If they didn't have the pasta, she should've given me a heads up when I ordered, that way I could've picked a different item instead. There was no \"carbonara pizza\" on the menu, so I don't know where she got the idea to turn carbonara into pizza.  It tasted like scrambled eggs on pizza dough.  Terrible! Will not come back, that's for sure.",

We were seated in the only remaining table on the patio, our waitress was friendly, upbeat and didn't reflect the busy that she was.  We started with the calamari and it was fantastic, light and crunchy with just a hint of heat.  I enjoyed the Quattro Frommagio (4 cheese) pizza. The crust was perfectly cooked and both chewy and crunchy. My husband had a sausage and mushroom pizza. Both of us ate until we were stuffed because it was just outstanding. We reluctantly left some because we were in a hotel with a fridge.  When we finished the outstanding waitress was there to give us the check but made sure we didn't feel rushed in spite of the volume. I wish every restaurant understood how important the wait staff is to the dining experience.  Bravo for getting this exactly right. Next time we are in Phoenix, we will be back!!",

    "text": "Gonna edit my review but not yet update my review.  GM or someone from Pomo called and wants to send us a refund of our money. I find that to actually be sensible and a good follow-up. Again we aren't looking for free food but refunding us for a bad experience is compliment-able. I'll raise the review to 3 stars and we will in the future try again one more time.  Fingers crossed.   I find myself days later still irritated.  Slept on it a couple days before writing this and still unhappy.   Here is the T.   We liked our waiter.  We liked the bartender.  We liked the manager.   But... We came to Pomo because of the high reviews.  We came about an hour and 10 mins before closing.  Their was a couple ahead of us not yet sat because of some reason. (Which is the staff were on a one mind track to clean and tighten up the restaurant to be out at closing)  The manager or hostess was too busy to clarify which of the two parties waiting to be sat was to follow her to be sat.  Awkward but easily forgiven/no one is perfect.  We were then sat at an awkward table in the middle of other tables ready to leave. The waiter couldn't even get to us or he just wasn't taking the time to actually stop and give us time(?) again we made do. No harm. No foul.  We waited about 20 mins before we actually received our drinks. The staff was busy and we assumed they were just trying to close our tables and get guests on their way which is reasonable except that it isn't the reason of the lack of service. (Again, reason is the staff were on a one mind track to clean and tighten up the restaurant to be out at closing)   We told the manager/host it was our first time and for suggestions.  She rapid fired off suggestions while keeping tight to her cleaning duties.  Beautiful accent, beautiful lady but if your head is turned away from us when your speaking.  It makes it hard to hear. Waiter gave us suggestions but no one ever stopped to give us direct attention. It was on the way to doing something.  Since there was maybe only two other tables it wasn't being attentive to other customers. (the staff were on a one mind track to clean and tighten up the restaurant to be out at closing)  We get the meatballs in this amazing marinara sauce. No one bothers to ask if we may want bread to dip in the sauce or to enhance our experience with the handcrafted food in front of us (because the staff were on a one mind track to clean and tighten up the restaurant to be out at closing)  Eggplant Parmigiana comes with our pizza. I'm able to request for some house bread to dip in the eggplant parmigiana before the waiter jets back to what is most important (Which is the staff were on a one mind track to clean and tighten up the restaurant to be out at closing)  We were able to order drink another round of drinks. We opt to stay with what we had because we had no other choice.  Finally we feel out of place with all their staff walking around us like ants and we ask for to go boxes to get out of the way. Manager and waiter say \"you're good. Stay and finish\"  stay and finish for what reason. The experiments already out the window. So many outstanding restaurants around this pizza joint and our first time at this place was a wast in our time and our valuable resource \"money\".   Yes the food was great.  Yes the staff was friendly  But I can go almost anywhere in central Phoenix for good food and friendly hipster staff.  Definitely know where We should go that nets us a great experience and keeps us coming back.  Not Pomo.   Sorry that our work schedules doesn't coincide with the best time for Pomo to have its customers eat and visit.   You missed the mark on what should've been a great experience Pomo.  I hope you all made it home as close to closing tim as you were hoping.   Pomo does not have my recommendation and I don't want a petty free meal.  We just wanted a great experience at what is supposed to be a high rated restaurant.",

I had the meatballs, which were room temperature and the sauce tasted like it came from a jar of Ragu. The bruschetta was basically a hamburger bun with some under ripe cut up tomatoes on it.  The service was fine, although the waitress chose not to write down the orders of our six person group and then had to come back a few minutes later to ask every single one of us what we had ordered again.",

This was around $15.  Then for dessert I had their signature flavor of gelato, \"Luna\" which has pistachio, caramel, and dark chocolate - tasted divine. The 1 scoop of gelato is $4. I actually enjoyed the gelato more than the pasta so I'll be back for that. They also have other gelato flavors, as well as sorbets, and a pleasantly large dessert and coffee menu!  Service was great! Kelly was my server and she was wonderful and checked on me from time to time.   I was informed by the manager that for parking, there is the \"705 N 1st\" lot for Pomo (SE corner, inside ASU lot). After 5pm, Pomo customers can use the AFMA parking lot, next to the ASU lot. Both of these parking lots are behind the Pomo building, at 2nd street and Pierce.",

This place is VERA certified and this means a lot. They have been given certification based on their pizza making process. That certified process qualifies them as legitimate Neapolitan style pizza and it was apparent when tasting the pizza. I ordered their Arugula and Parma Ham pizza and it was possibly one of the best pizza's I've had in the anywhere in the US (I have not yet visited the east coast). Something they get right is the consistency of crust. It's soft, but it's crispy and those two elements compliment each other greatly.  This is legit pizza and if you're not eating here when you're in Phoenix, you're doing it wrong.",

Just as we were finishing the calamari one of the entrees arrived.  The entrees did not come to the table together, 5-7 minutes between delivery of each entree.  Two of them were not hot.  The food was good, mine for sure I think would have been much better had it been served hot.  We all liked our entrees, albeit the gap in the service.  Deserts were ordered, after placing our order one was served, the server then advised they were out of the other two.  We ordered two alternate choices and waited 7-8 minutes for them to be served.  The place was busy, seems they were short handed.  I would like to go back.  Will give Pomo another try, just hope the service and timing issues are resolved before I return.",

It took 10 minutes to have my server ask what I would like to drink. Another 10 minutes to get asked what I wanted to eat... then he never once asked me if I wanted another drink. As my cup sits with the ice melting. Did he ask if I liked my drink, no. Our main entree came out and again, it tasted amazing. Yet our waiter did not ask if either of us wanted another drink.  I love their food. Seriously so good. I am so dissatisfied with their service. It's very disappointing.",

    "text": "This is an update to my 12.7.18 two-star review. First, I was impressed that Cricket Pearson, their regional manager, personally responded and apologized for the disappointing experience we had at Pomo's. She sent me a gift card, asking me to return, to give them another go & so glad we did.   Right off the bat, Alec (or Alex?!), our server was a delight: kind, attentive and gracious. The music on the outdoor patio was so loud, my friend and I couldn't hear each other talk. We came to Pomo's to celebrate her relocating from Phoenix to the East Coast. When we asked Alec if the music could be lowered, he went in and did just that. No problem.   We ordered a few different dishes: I ate the eggplant parm appetizer, a balanced ratio of eggplant, cheese and sauce, seasoned with basil. I liked that the eggplant was \"pure,\" not coated in bread crumbs. We both had chopped salad: a fresh blend of cherry tomatoes, red onion, lettuces, almonds, avocado, generously peppered with feta cheese and tossed with a lemon vinaigrette. I ordered a side of bread with dipping olive oil for a mere $1.50. I asked for butter of course.    All of their pastas are homemade so we were both excited to see gnocchi on the menu. Gnocchi is one of my go-to dishes when I dine at Italian restaurants. My friend ordered this but their version was a joyless jumble of large-cut overcooked gnocchi, melted cheese, in a bland tomato sauce. The gnocchi themselves were dense, like heavy pieces of boiled dough. IMO, the best gnocchi are smaller and fluffier. Since this was my friend's dish and her special occasion, we ordered another one. Alec graciously brought a second plate that was, unfortunately, not better. I think it would have been wiser to order a completely different dish. I did have that second dish of gnocchi boxed to take home, so my Italian neighbor could sample it & he was a \"no\" on the gnocchi as well so...  We shared an Amerena Cherry gelato, savoring the divine rich flavor, a sweet vein of cherry running through it. When I reviewed our bill, we weren't charged for it, so I ran in & told our server about the mistake. He told me it was comped b/c of the gnocchi. Wow that wasn't necessary but appreciate the gesture, Alec :)  Moving on! The restaurant IS called Pomo's Pizzeria & sad to say, I still haven't tried their pizza. We will definitely return and try one of their many unusual pizza combos as well as their other homemade pastas - perhaps the strozzapreti or tagliatelle + they have pizza with gluten-free crust.  Downtown Phoenix Pomo's is super appealing: city location & atmosphere, outdoor patio dining options, exceptional service, and some delicious dishes. Again I appreciate the conscientiousness of management to give us an opportunity to sample Pomo's again. That kind of responsiveness is rare. Grazie!",

Wait time on busy weekends can take a bit, but the bar with outdoor seating is a great place to wait.  Everyone I've encountered is always friendly and helpful.  I like the nice touch of the fried dough sticks with powder sugar at the end of the meal.  Once in a while, you get offered a complimentary shot which is an added bonus if you drink.",

    "text": "The pizza here is phenomenal.  The best margherita pizza in Phoenix.  I came in on a lunch break during the week and sat at the bar.  I'm not exaggerating when I say I sat there for over 10 minutes before anyone approached me.  I was quite disconsolate when I walked in and didn't feel like talking to anyone so I felt content to just sit there and watch the female (only) staff of servers walk back and forth in front of me- trying not to make eye contact because then they'd have to take my order.  As I watched them interact together, I realized that none of them liked each other.  In fact, it was like watching a commercial for the Bad Girls reality TV show but this was more entertaining.  Finally, a chef approached the bar to make himself a drink of water, feeling rather thirsty I said \"hey, do you mind if I get one of those, too?\"  He was more than happy to make me one and asked me what I would like to eat and I told him I wanted a margherita pizza.  Within literally minutes my hot and fresh pizza was out.  The Chefs name was Mateo and he was freaking awesome. The owner also came by and made sure I had everything I needed including a nice tall Peroni to go with my delicious pie.  I can't wait to come back in and get served by the guys while I watch the waitresses claw each others eyes out.  Dinner and a show.",

Felt like I was in Italy with the chef explaining to me what makes Pomo so different. All imported ingredients. The oven is at like 900 degrees so the pie is done in 2 minutes. Crust is perfect, sauce is traditional and to die for, and the cheese taste like Italian heritage. Not every pizza is on this level but the majority are. Lasagna was fire. Salads are bangin. Service is always amazing, and Mauricio the manager will seduce you with his Italian accent and heartwarming hospitality. Makes me feel like a young Italian boy talking to his great uncle. They love my kids and make sure they have a great time. The complimentary lemoncello changed my life. Best I've ever had in life. Ever. David behind the bar is great, all the staff and chefs are smiling and they love what they do. Pomo is a True experience.",

Hated to waste a great bottle of Seghesio Zin on that pizza, but maybe it saved the evening from a complete disaster. It didn't appear that one could really custom order your pie from a variety of ingredients. If you choose to ignore my warning at least check the menu first. Expensive (gotta pay for hip, right?)",

    "text": "Our first visit was so terrific, we couldn't wait to come back. We love the patio, but it's still a little too hot to sit outside. So, for this trip, we sat inside. Again, service was prompt and friendly. We had water on the table and a drink order taken within minutes of sitting. Our server was helpful with suggestions, and stopped by just the right amount to check on us. When she didn't stop at the table, I still observed her eyeballing our table to see how full our beers were, or how far we were into our Mista salad--which is the best salad on the menu. It's also the only one we've tried so far ... The pizza, Quattro Stagioni, was so good. Thin crust, and just enough sausage and olives to make it a nice-sized main course. We still had room to try some desserts this time. On our previous visit, we had a salad and two pizzas. While all were fantastic, we screwed ourselves out of really great desserts--which is knowledge we gained on this visit. Peter had the Semifreddo, and I had the Tiramisu. The Semifreddo tasted of cherries, though it's made of fig. Peter loved it. My Tiramisu was the best I've ever had--and I've had a few. It was so light and flavorful. Somehow, though I was stuffed half-way through it, I managed to finish the whole thing. I'll pay for that later. Just for balance, I should probably mention some \"opportunities'--as we call them where I work. Really, I mention them only for balance, because we both really love this place, and plan to return often. The toppings on the pizza was very unevenly distributed. Most of the sausage was on one half, and most of the olives on the other. (See, hardly worth mentioning, but ...) Also, ... the Tiramisu could have been cut in half (or maybe two thirds). It was just too big. (First World problems.) I took a pic of the Tiramisu, but my phone ate it before I realized it was gone, and I couldn't share it here. Again, Matteo, the owner, brought over his bottle of creamy Limoncello just as we finished everything. He's such a nice guy, though, I suspect, not so good with the English--which is all the better. He just smiles and nods, and we assure him everything was \"so damn good.\" We thank him too much for how great everything is. Because ... we're just so grateful for this great pizza restaurant, right in the neighborhood. So, two Perronis (beer), a Mista salad, a pizza, and two desserts came to just about $50. Money well spent, if you ask me.",

Every pizza is superlative and the charming atmosphere - created by the sincerity of owner, host, and server alike - cause you to feel like you've come home. Start with the prosciutto-adorned cantaloupe and be sure finish with the complimentary house limoncello. Made from a fourth-generation family recipe, this delectable milky, citrusy goodness is the perfect way to end a fantastic meal.",

    "text": "My friends and I love pizza and we decided to try this place that we have heard so much about.  We arrived at 7:00P to an already full restaurant and put our name on the list.  They said it was about a half hour wait so we went to the bar and ordered drinks and waited for our table.  The bartender was friendly, efficient and engaging.  In almost exactly 30 minutes our table was ready and we went outside to the patio to be seated.  Our charming young waitress was Celine (as in Dion) and was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make some choices.  We ordered two kinds of bruschetta as appetizer while we continued to enjoy the downtown scene and our cocktails and conversations.  The bruschetta arrived and was covered in contents!  Delicious!!  We quickly devoured then ordered our pizzas from friendly Celine.  The pizza here is Neopolitan style (very thin crust).  They arrived in no time and each one looked and tasted amazing.  I can't pronounce the names but we had three different ones plus the Mista salad and each was done perfectly!    After dinner while we were enjoying ourselves and finishing up, the owner of the restaurant came by with a tiny after dinner desert plate consisting of what seemed like pastry of some kind with powdered sugar on it.  Nothing fancy, but a nice complimentary gesture they do for every guest after dining.  On top of that he brought out four little shot glasses and began to pour a yellowish mixture from a bottle.  He said it was his own blend of lemoncello and cream and he thanked us for coming in and said he hoped we would be back.  What a nice finishing touch to an already wonderful meal.  The shot glass size lemoncello/cream was delicious and something I had never thought about combining.  Celine came back again to thank us for coming in and urged us to come back again.  This will definitely be added to our regular pizza dining experience in the future!",

The food is truly heaven to the taste buds with their fresh ingredients and traditional Italian recipes. They are inventive with their menu and there is no need to have anything more than what is on it...because everything is delicious...simply perfect! The owner takes pride in ensuring his customers are happy by greeting every single person that walks through his door and offering special goodies to enhance your taste buds and experience (I will leave that one in suspense for you to find out on your own).  We ordered the tiramisu and my family put candles in it to sing to me. As if this delectable dessert was not wonderful enough, as soon as the owner saw me blow out my candles, he rushed to make me a special birthday treat of his own. A birthday sprinkled plate with a canoli (absolutely delicious) for everyone at the table and a rose dollop of dessert cream with a candle in it. Then he shared a shot of cinnamon crema from Italy with everyone at the table to salute my birthday. I FELT LIKE A QUEEN!  Additionally, you must try their chamomile grappa. Must!  I cannot express enough how the beautiful atmosphere, amazing food and kind service made my entire night so very special. I will never forget it and I will be back as often as time will allow me to be.  THANK YOU POMO for making this birthday girl very happy!",

They use truly authentic ingredients and they have have a wood stove that was  brought from Naples, Italy.   The pizza crust is full of flavor and the toppings are so amazing. Fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, spicy salmi and many other tasty toppings.  In addition, their appetizers are also amazing. Fresh buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes and some field greens make a perfect start to your meal.   After you eat your delightful pizza, then try their simply tasty desserts.  We tried their deep fried dough sprinkled with powdered sugar. Simple but yet a great way top off your meal.   In addition, we also tried the homemade limoncello. It was pure delight! Just like the limoncello my mother makes.  A perfect way to cap off the dining experience.    Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the owner and chef, Matteo, was extremely hospitable  as was the wait staff.  If you are looking for a way eat like you are in Italy without spending all the time and money to get there, eat at Pomo's and you will at least et a very authentic meal and you can wash it down with a nice glass of Perroni.    I can't wait to head back to Phoenix so I can get another taste of Italy.  I only wish they would deliver to Cincinnati!",

The server was very sweet and friendly, decor was pleasing, bathrooms were clean on our Saturday evening visit.  Loved the little fried dough powder sugar things our server referred to as \"crack\", indeed, addictive, nothing left on plate.  For that matter, my husband and I shared a salad and a pizza and were very full and content!  Going back with our daughter tonight, gonna try the lasagne.",

So those people who are looking for perfection from a very affordable restaurant are \"smoking\" stuff!   My girl had the pizza which was really good, and I had the lasagna which was above average. I did love the complementary lemoncello shot, and the dessert.  The only negative was that the young waitress (very good-looking so I will overlook) brought out our plates one at a time and said some lame excuse that she didn't know we wanted them together. What? So we are going to eat separately? Obviously, there was a mixup but I'm prone to those so I'm not going to hold it over her because she was young and easy on the eyes. :)",

The flavor in the crust itself is solid, and it serves as a well textured base to the pizza. The thinness of the crust is perfect for Neapolitan pizza. My only dislike here is the lack of oven spring on the ring of the crust, as the crust seems to have lost some gas somewhere along the way.   The sauce at Pomo is the centerpiece of the pizza. Pomo delivers a bright and simple tomato sauce with well-balanced acidity which blends itself into slices of fresh mozzarella. There's a great ration of cheese-to-sauce, as Pomo avoids a tendency of some Neapolitan places to undercheese the pie. The cheese avoids any unwanted browning and mixes really well into the overall flavor profile.   Pomo's Principe introduced me to the magic of prosciutto and arugula and I've yet to find a place that does it better. If you're not loving the slightly steeper prices on some of the pizzas, you can't go wrong with their margherita either.   Pomo matches the quality of their pizza with attentive service and a friendly and generous owner. One negative however- the \"house bread\" looked and tasted like it came out of a sandwich bread bag. Not the level of effort I expected after tasting their pizza. However, even that's not enough to prevent me from giving it a 5-star rating.  If you're looking for some of the best pizza in Phoenix and would like to avoid the line at Bianco's, Pomo is nearby and serving their own Neapolitan pizza on par with almost anything else you'll find.",

    "text": "Move over Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco, you now have a new follower!  Thought Cibo was the best pizza in the valley until I discovered Pomo a few days ago.  Only regret I have is not finding this place earlier!  What started off as a shaky start (not being acknowledged for 10 minutes after sitting down) turned out to be an excellent meal and even better service.    Compared to it's competitors, Pomo has a lot more on their menu to order from.  I got the classic Bruchetta and Margarita Pizza.  I was absolutely blown away by the flavors in the bruchetta, but the pizza was the star of the night.  Perfect dough, san marzano tomato sauce, ovalini mozzarella, basil.  slightly chared on the bottom.  perfection.  Towards the end of the meal, the owner came to my table and provided me a desert.  I said thank you, but I didn't order this.  He said, I know, but this is something we would like to give you for free.  A few minutes later, he comes back with a shot glass and some sort of alcoholic beverage.  I said thank you, but I don't drink.  They acknowledged that they messed up by having me wait in the beginning, but made up for it with this genuine offer.  I will definitely be a frequent visitor of Pomo as they also have locations in Chandler, Scottsdale, and Glendale.  Looking forward to my next pizza...seriously, this stuff is good.",

Great decoration, wonderful staff, knowledgeable and kind waitresses (Kiera was super kind) and really good food.  The caprese salad was superb, hands down.  I also had the Pomo pizza which was very good.  The chef (I believe he's the owner) is super kind and he stopped by our table to greet and invite my friend and I a shot of a liquor that was pretty tasty and also shared some kind of desert which was also pretty good.  A funny fact is that all the floor staff were women (beautiful and super kind women).  BTW the bar looks pretty cool as well, could be a good place for a happy hour for two.  I'll be back soon.

    "text": "We were so impressed by this place!   The space is small. My boyfriend and I didn't have reservations, and no tables were available when we arrived around 6pm, but there were seats available by the \"pizza bar\" so we sat there. The pizza bar is right in front of the kitchen and oven, and you can see all the pizzas being made.  The waitress was very friendly and explained the menu to us, as there are three different types of pizza listed: I believe they are classic (red sauce), traditional napoletana style, and white. The prices are reasonable for what you get. The pizzas were some of the best I've ever had. The white pizza we chose had parmesan and prosciutto. They don't skimp on the prosciutto-- the entire pizza was covered in a layer! The red pizza had cooked onions and pancetta. The sauce is unique and delicious; one of the kitchen staff told us that the sauce is made specifically for this type of pizza. The thin crust has a nice crispy finish on the outside.   We watched them make the pizzas; the employees are clearly experts at it. The food comes out quickly, as the oven takes only about four minutes to cook each pizza. The time from oven to table was literally under a minute-- one employee would take the pizza out of the oven, another would be waiting to slice it, and a runner would be waiting to take the pizza to the table. I loved that the owner was pitching in in the kitchen and taking food out to the tables. When one of the pizza-makers had downtime, he went to wash some dishes. Everything runs efficiently.   When we were done eating, we were looking at the dessert menu when the owner brought us a free dessert. I'm not sure what it's called, but it's kind of like elephant ears or a funnel cake but more crispy dough, sprinkled with powdered sugar. Then the owner surprised us again with free shots of limoncello! The waitress told us that the owner makes the limoncello himself. It was amazingly sweet and smooth. Drink it slowly; one of the kitchen staff said people tend to knock back the shot quickly, but you're supposed to drink it slowly and savor it. I agree.  When we told the owner how happy we were with the meal, he seemed genuinely happy and thankful. The staff clearly care a lot about their customers and creating a good experience. I only wish they had a location in DC, where I live!  Parking is the only downside, as it's not free. There are limited 3-hour meters out front; the rest are 1-hour, so you would have to go out to feed the meter halfway through your meal. We parked next door in the university parking lot, which was $5.",

We requested to speak with the manager. She refused to call the manager over. Saying one was no one on duty. Wow! Then she ignored us at the reception podium for another 5 mins to wait us out.

This comes with Prosciutto Cotto, Gaeta Olives, Artichoke, and  Mushroom. I loved it! Everything was amazing except I wasn't a big fan of the olives. I washed it down with the Pinot Noir wine which was delicious.   Not only was the pizza delicious but what makes the place is the customer service. Maurizio did such a great job. He always made sure that we got everything we needed and was so friendly and funny! Ask for him when you come here!   So you got good food, good drinks and good customer service right? What else can top that? How about the owner coming around with free shots that he made! Um what!? What restaurant do you know that comes around your table giving you free shots!!?? Not to mention we also got free desert! This place was such a cute little spot for a date or even with friends for a great night of pizza and wine. =)",

I didn't get the name of the gentleman at the bar who served us the second night but he was a great guy. Complimentary shots of lemoncello. Even though we came in just before close he made sure to let us know there was no rush and to enjoy ourselves.   In my opinion this is a must visit for anyone visiting Phoenix.",

My go to faves are the mushroom soup, the meatballs (of course), the pepino pizza, and the strozzapreti salsiccia is to die for! Every time I go back I want to venture out and try new things, but these are just too good to stray from.  We always end the evening with their tasty lemoncello which is insanely good.  I have to say, I have quite a few favorite restaurants in town that I would recommend even after being a little off their \"A\" game at one point or another (hey it happens, I don't hold that against them).  I will say, I've been going to Pomo (downtown location) for years and it is probably one of THE most consistent places I've ever been to.  Food is always tasty and the service is always top notch.  Thank you for always taking care of us! Definitely a top recommendation from me when you are in the Phoenix area!",

    "text": "Whaddup fam. I walked into this place in an Uptown Funk type of mood. A few coworkers and I had one of those Secret Santa shindigs and we had to come to a quorum on a place that could satisfy and satiate a diverse set of palates. So we settled on Pomo, and since it was a Friday night, we called ahead of time and had a table prepared for us. We entered that joint like Bruno Mars and his crew at the beginning of Uptown Funk - we were fly.  I look back on it now, and I now realize in hindsight that I was unwittingly having my Last Supper moment with them. I ain't Jesus, nor were any of them endowed with otherworldly powers, but it was the last time we all broke bread together; and I am happy to say it was a delightfully memorable experience.   Phoenix has Fired Pie, Dominoes, Little Caesar's, hell it has Digiorno if those commercials really hit a nerve and you actually wanna pass that off as delivery (Tombstone better IMO.) Pomo towers above those brands. I am a pretty simple guy so I always get pepperoni, but my bros and gals got dishes that completed the entire spectrum of colors that the human eye can comprehend.  My pizza was stellar. So stellar that I was thinking about eating half there and saving the rest for the weekend. Note I went there on a Friday. That pizza is so good you wanna divvy up the rest of it for a fun weekend. It could be a \"hey I've known you for three years and just asked you on a date food,\" or it's 3am and my head feels like Alan's after he got hit by Tyson in the Hangover. As far as I know, my crew shared similar sentiments.  Now on to cost. When you are getting high-end stuff, you pay a bit more. So make sure you are ready to take hammer to your poor piggy bank. Also, topic switch, the general mood. The place is chill. It's the Jason Bourne of restaurants. From the staff to the chairs it's calm, collected, and cordial. This all coalesces in a way to ensure you're able to have a good time with the right people. It's also quite close to De Soto and the rest of downtown, so it's in good walking distance if this is the first stop before many.  There was one drawback. One drawback which took away that 5 star spot. The bread. Fam, I've been to Red Lobster and have had 3 servings of those cheddar biscuits and have tried to get out of paying the bill. I mean damn, I've been to a Chinese restaurant that was once an Opera theatre that served baller bread. Oddly though, the bread here doesn't cause one to salivate. I don't know all the facts behind this bread. Maybe an investigation by the F.B.I. needs to be launched to deduce why the bread here doesn't compare to lesser establishments.   But everything considered, Pomo is dope AF. I got to have one last hoorah with a group of people that I have ended up cherishing like Jesus cherished his disciples. Pomo is only 4 stars for me because I am really picky about bread - I own that pickiness. But for most it will likely be 5 stars. Don't waste your time with pizza that shames the name. Get down to Pomo and chow down.",

    "text": "So I got food delivered from here and the pizza was mediocre but the pasta was pretty good. That could have been enough for a three star review but then I opened the tiramisu, omfg!!!! The mascarpone was rotten like sour and miserable tasting. It even looked off when I opened the box. I have pretty low standards on just life in general and don't expect much outside of maybe ordering food that isn't old and nasty. Seriously I just got out of freaking prison and when your tiramisu makes me long for prison grade desserts your restaurant has a fundamental flaw if that will even leave your kitchen. I called and talked to the manager and he seemed to know about the issue like this has happened before and on numerous occasions. I don't want gift cards or a free meal, I just want to have faith in a restaurant that when I am ordering I can get edible food, plus i was on a date at someone else's freaking house!!! How do you recover from that?? The manager was pretty funny though when I talked to him, his thick accent made me remember all the good Italian food restaurants that used to exist in Phoenix. So in closing I give up!  Edit: they did reach out and seem legitimately apologetic and hopefully this issue won't happen again. The restaurant industry is hard and nothing will ever be perfect but it is nice that when mistakes are made they want to rectify it.",

    "text": "Pomo is possibly one of the best pizza spots in Phoenix, and there are a few. Napoli would be proud of what is being served up at this quaint little place. It's a winner.  Why go there: Central Ave is full of good places to eat downtown. This place stands out because of the quality and consistency of their pizzas. They had pizzas that took me back to my childhood where this Italian man from Napoli, in Paris (no less), would crank out about 80 pies on select nights in our neighborhood, from his wood fired oven built in his obscure van.. The Pomo fam is for real.  Their pies are tossed into this stone oven, wood burning oven, possibly holding a 900 degree heat, and come out lighting fast. Their Neapolitan pizzas are truly a reminder of what Italian food tastes like in Italy. Sauces are not thick and heavy, everything is balanced and fresh. The apps and dessert card are solid with plenty to choose from but not too diverse. Service is always solid and they know their stuff.  Don't miss: Two pizzas stand out, the Diavola if you enjoy a little kick from a spicy salami. And a white pizzas with four cheeses, the Quattro Fromaggi.  They also have a killer house made gnocchi that will surely please, that's a good main dish to share actually as an appetizer actually. Hope you are humble enough to ask for a good wine pairing, because what you get here will surely elevate their offerings. Their desserts... really, almost any of them will do. We've tried them all (don't judge). Our soft spot is for the panna cotta... we'll have two please.  Tip: If you can and don't mind, try to sit at the bar where they make the pizzas, it's fascinating, the guys craft those pies with love and precision. It's refreshing, get a good front row seat if you're not looking to gaze into each other's eyes over dinner. This is gonna be equally as fun. The GM will come by after your meal for a round of limoncello on the house for the table. Not a bad way to see you off, so hang tight and save a bit of room for that last little goodie... Salute!",

    "text": "Pomo is currently sitting atop the Phoenix Yelp Homepage as the #1 restaurant in the area. I originally had this place bookmarked because it's a VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana [True Neapolitan Pizza]) location, but the fact that it's currently ranked #1 solidified it as a \"must-go\" for me on my visit. For your edification: the VPN is a Naples-based non-profit group that certifies your pizzeria in that the pizza is being made a certain way (i.e, ingredients, cooking method, preparation, etc.)--however, as my Yelp friend Glenn G reminds me (over and over): \"I've unfortunately learned this does NOT guarantee the quality of the pizza.\" So with that in mind, let's begin our journey.  Antipasti:  Piatto Di Bufala- This is basically a salad comprised of Arugula, Grape Tomatoes, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Buffalo Milk Mozzarella. I loved the mozzarella and the rest was pretty standard; not sure I'd order it again as it's a bit much to pay ($14) for mostly greens. 3*  Tradizionale:  Regina Margherita- This really is one of the most simple (and original!) pizza types out there; it's just San Marzano Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Fresh Basil. I think when made well it might be my hands down favorite pizzas of all-time, and Pomo does a fantastic job with it. From the crispy and chewy crust; to the gooey mozzarella; and the freshness of the tomatoes and basil it was a sheer delight. This is a must try. 5*  Classica:  Capricciosa- For our second pie we got something a little more \"fancy\" and ordered the Capricciosa, which consists of Prosciutto, Gaeta Olives, Artichoke, and Mushrooms. We did the 'chokes on only half of the pie because my Bro-in-law is not a fan. The pizza was pretty good, but I think in comparison to the Margherita there was no competition. Unfortunately, I should've eaten a slice of this first, before having the Margherita--but I didn't and it couldn't hold a candle to it. 3.5*  Bambini  Pizza Ciro- I was a bit surprised to see that they have a kid's menu so we ordered the Ciro -which is just San Marzano and Mozzarella- and added Sausage. They have another kid's pie that had Salami, but for some reason they couldn't substitute the Salami for the Sausage. We agreed, but upon inspecting the bill I noticed that they charged an extra $3 for the kid's pie just for the sausage; so, a $6 pie went to a $9 pie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not being cheap, but something about that just irked me the wrong way. For $2 more I could've ordered another Margherita! Regardless, the boy loved it and the sausage was very high quality. 4*-pie/ 2*-for the pricing   Dessert:  Torta Nutella- As soon as I saw this I had to have it. It's a flourless chocolate cake; filled with an Italian Nutella Cream and Hazelnuts; and topped with a Chocolate Ganache and more Hazelnuts. Sounds good right? Well, it was good, but not good as expected. I guess I was hoping it'd be sweeter but it was more of a dark chocolate mix which is good, but not what I wanted. It's also very rich and decadent so it can easily be shared by two people. 3.75*  Service & Ambiance- Great service from our waitress, Amanda. She was very nice, helpful and answered any questions we had. Pomo is located in a pretty small building in Downtown Phoenix in a quaint section of town that doesn't make you feel like you're in a large city. The building seats about 30 (inside and out) and is very cozy. I think the best part of the building is how you can watch the boys prepare your pizzas and being able to stare at the awesome VPN-approved oven. Perfect spot for a date night. 4.5*-service/5*-Ambiance  Value- Other than the \"Sausage Incident\" mentioned above, their pizza prices are fantastic. I think they could stand to lower their dessert and antipasti prices a bit, but with that being said we still only paid $15/head for a party of 3 adults and one child. 3.75*  Usually after visiting a place that's much ballyhooed there's usually always a bit of disappointment, but Pomo was pretty terrific--especially the Margherita! I think I would agree with the current Yelp average of 4.5-stars, but I think I'll round it down to 4 because I just don't see myself wanting to come back the next day--which is usually one of my criteria for a 5-star rating. Plus, the Sausage pricing left kind of a bad taste in my mouth, but nevertheless, Pomo gets a huge thumbs up and is highly recommended.",

In the battle of phoenix pizzerias, Pomo takes top billing for me these days, delicious, fresh, oh man, it's soo good. When you're finished with your meal, don't forget to ask them about their limoncello; the best anywhere and best yet, this is a complimentary after dinner drink. Tell them your friends say they serve the best limoncello in all the land and they'll promptly and proudly serve one up in a flash.  Happy yelping Phoenix, if you're going for Pomo later, don't forget to invite me along ;-)",

    "text": "Solid three stars.  It seems to me that Phoenix has a good thing going with Pizza. The last time I visited, I had a fantastic experience at Grimaldi's. I think this place comes pretty close. It's all better than Isola in San Diego, but that's just my opinion.  I shared their Romana salad which is easily in my top five favorite salads. I can probably drink the dressing they put over it. The perfect lemon/olive oil ratio. Their Margherita is also so fresh and delicious. Generous portion of sauce and mozz. Yum! They also provide a decent complimentary desert. Fried dough I assume with powdered sugar.  Why three stars? The service is horrible. We wanted to sit inside since it was so hot out and we were promised to be seated inside next. Then all of a sudden came this list of other people who got inside before us because of an imaginary list. We also had to waive down our waitress a few times when needing service. Lastly, she wasn't up to date on their beer selection so she came back and forth about three different times with different answers about the beer they had to offer.",

Tonight we could have had a table but chose to be seated at the bar.  Our server, Amber, was attentive and gave us excellent recommendations. My wife had an Aperol Spritz (a drink she had in Italy this summer), and I stuck to red wine.   We started out with the bruschetta, she had the capriossa pizza and I had the diavola pizza. Each pizza was superb. Instead of red pepper flakes, they have this red pepper flake oil that is divine. The owner came by the drop off freshly grated Parmesan that was to die for along with Italian dried herbs that we did not use.   Following our meal, we were treated to some complimentary pizza crusts topped with cinnamon and sugar.   Will absolutely return to this gem in downtown.  Ciao!",

Pizza preferences are very subjective, so about all I can say is that I ordered four different pizzas, and while I thought they were all quite good, nothing stood out as \"the best\" of what you can get in the area. (Specifically, I thought they lacked a bit in flavor and were heavy on the olive oil.) If Pizzaria Bianco and Cibo weren't nearby, this would be a good choice, but I'd recommend those other two places over this one.",

We opted to eat outside even in winter as it was a nice night and the space heaters provided plenty of heat. We loved the feel of the place.  We ordered the bruschetta to start, and it was delicious. It was especially divine with the spicy olive oil drizzled on top.  We ordered two pizzas: the Principe with prosciutto crudo, fresh arugula, and shaved parmigiano and the Toto Sapore with Italian sausage, pancetta, salame piccante and prosciutto cotto.  Between the four of us, there was enough food to share. We loved being able to try two different pizzas. The Principe was delightful - especially the thinly sliced prosciutto. I had it with some of the spicy olive oil, which made it perfect. We all also enjoyed the Toto Sapore. The meats were delicious. All the ingredients on both pizzas were of great quality.  To end the night we ordered a tiramisu to split. The slice was large and perfect for each of us to have a good sized piece. We also enjoyed the little pieces of heaven they bring to everyone at the end of the meal - thin and crispy fried dough pieces covered in powdered sugar. The owner also brought out another dessert even after all of that - some sort of yummy cake with mascarpone. We were happy!  Price is decent too. For the four of us, included tip, we each paid $15.  Will definitely be back again for the good pizza, dessert, service, and atmosphere.",

    "text": "To me eating pizza, or really Italian food in general, is a social experience. You surround yourself with family and friends, and even sample each other's orders.    So that being said it really is about ambiance, as much as it is the food. But where I see Pomo miss is the ambiance. It is overly sterile, and cold. The staff there is great and that will help bring up the warmth level. But when they get busy, everyone in the place knows it and can feel it which is distracting.   Many will enjoy the high quality ingredients they use, as I do. I enjoy the simple nature of the food, it isn't overly complicated in construction but after the four+ times I've been there I haven't found a favorite on the menu yet.",

    "text": "After a date to the Phoenix Symphony, we walked a bit to find this small and well reviewed pizza place. We had never been until tonight.   This may be my new favorite restaurant. It's so phenomenal that even writing this review creates a division in me because I want to keep it a secret BUT more than that I want it to thrive.   Wow. Literally the best service I've had possibly in my life, the freshest caprese salad of my life, easily one of the top 3 pizzas of my life (we ordered the pomo which is mushrooms, red bell peppers, onions, and sausage... It's much better than it sounds) and some very good ambiance.   We ate outside and the weather happened to be ideal. (March nights are great) The bar next door had enjoyable live music too. I am shocked that this place is all around as great as it is.  If you can, stop by with an open mind and an empty stomach. You will not be disappointed. Possibly best of all, the bill for both of us to eat very well: 26 bucks.  Wow.   *standing ovation* Bravo! Encore!",

They close between 2-5pm on weekdays but stayed open after lunch to cook for us.  We were given the best service and the pizza was incredible.  The calzone was just as good.  There were zero left overs as we demolished everything on the table.  We were very appreciative of Myra, our server, and the cook, Fernando.  You won't be disappointed here!",

Pomo also has a cute bar,  and equally cute \" al fresco\" dining area . They use really select fresh imported ingredients,  and cook the pizza in one helluva oven (950 degrees). The meat and cheese plate paired with some great olives was delicious as was my mushroom soup.  Our table ordered 2 pies (sausage,mushroom,onion,peppers)(zucchini,peppers,egplant)  The pizza was simply outstanding, i allowed myself a slice ..and it was a slice of heaven Grilled zucchini,roasted red peppers ,eggplant. The presentation, aroma,  and taste was wonderful, the crust perfect !....This is PIZZA ..Italian pizza ! We all really enjoyed this pizza and cannot wait to try more from the menu.  A nod to the pastry chef ..for the fabu chocolate molten cake ( with gelato) Cannoli, and fig custard ..oh and the amaretto cookies .  Service was terrific! solid menu!  pure authentic ingredients,  and certified napoletana pizza = 5 solid stars!",

For whatever reason, this spot seems to be unpopular but I like it because it keeps me warm AND I can see what's going on with my food!  My friend and I shared the Mista salad and the Pomo pizza. I was much more pleased this time with the food we ordered! The sausage on the Pomo pizza was delicious and the Mista salad was larger and more filling than we expected. It's also fun to get all of the little freebies. They brought out bread and oil, the fried strips of dough with powdered sugar (again), limoncello (again), and then this sweet cake. It felt like the longer we sat there, the more food they put in front of us! Service is very attentive and I never felt that we had to wait long for anything. Also, I'm assuming the man who gives out the limoncello shots is the owner and it's fun to see him around.   The pizza is still not my favorite in the valley (hence the 4 stars) but I can definitely say that it's a solid place to go and it's a nice option in the pizza rotation.",

Bianco = paper thin, irregular shaped pies with crunchy (no doughy) crust that's a little burned in a spot with or two with big bubbles and fantastically fresh ingredients  Cibo = crust about as thick as two nickles with the outside wonderfully flavored and small \"bubbles\" and chewy and fantastically fresh ingredients  Pomo = nickle thick bottom with outside crust right smack in the middle between the above two. Medium bubbles here. Again.. fantastically fresh ingredients. Their slices of pepperoni are thicker but smaller around than the other two  Really just depends on your mood that day. Reasonably priced like the rest and awesome pie.",

The crust of the bread and pizza were delightfully charred, but still chewy on the inside. All the ingredients were top-notch and the salad was perfectly dressed.   The complimentary fried dough and creamy limoncello were just the cherry on top of an awesome night of dining al fresco.",

The bread served with it was also dry and didn't taste good.  Margarita pizza-the sauce had no flavor. The basil was cooked-this is a big no no to me.  Principe pizza-too much olive oil and too much Parmesan cheese. Too salty. I've had this pizza before at another restaurant and the salt should be balanced.   Our server never came back to ask how any of our food was. I had to flag him down for drink refills. Keep in mind that there were only 5 tables seated while we were there and there was plenty of staff in the restaurant. At the end of the meal when he noticed there were only two pieces of the Principe pizza eaten and we declined a box he ask is something was wrong. At this time I told him the problems we had with the pizza that I've described here, he removed the pizza and boxed it up-I'm assuming to save for himself, which I don't have a problem with-but still charged me for it.   I wouldn't say the food is bad, but it is not worth the price. Go to Fired Pie and save some money, or if you want a pizza that is truly worth $17 then go to Pizzeria Bianco.",

The sauce was on point and the crust was crispy.  I also had some brushetta which I loved.  The only small deduction would be the person who put the toppings on the pizza. It was thrown on haphazardly with 1/2 the pizza having all the meat and the other half having veggies. Some slices seemed to be vegetarian and others triple meat. Didn't make for a great presentation. Still good food though.",

How can an establishment that have hundreds of reviews and border 5 stars get away with such a below average food?   Taken into account that I have been to a countless amount of top Italian restaurants, I do not feel guilty at all to give them two stars. The only reason why it has got an extra one war sure to staff hospitality and good service. Otherwise they would surely have got only one star.   Presentation was ok, but taste was way below average. Caprese salad cheese did not taste as fresh as it should. Pizzas tasted way below average. Borders weren't crunchy, but really doughy. Desserts were way too sweet. None of the Desserts were finished, and that's never a good sign.   I end this review stating that restaurant owners should revisit the formula of the restaurants one in a while. Maybe this pizza place was once a decent Italian restaurant. It is definitely not the case anymore.",

Someone had mentioned this below, but I do agree that this seems to be one of those places that gets a lot of hype so people may convince themselves that it's better than it actually is. The pizza was just 'good' in my opinion. I ordered a cappuccino too and when it came out I was like what the heck is this? Haha. There was no foam whatsoever. It just looked like chocolate milk. Still tasted decent, but was really weird. An Italian thing? Maybe? Who knows... I also ordered a salad. Nothing too special about it either. Though the mangoes on the salad were so ripe and delicious!!  While we are there they started to clean the brick oven and man it was a super powerful smell. Whatever chemicals they were using. Luckily we were done eating, but some people were getting nauseous. Something I could easily overlook if the food was amaze-balls but unfortunately it was just average. I did go there with some people who have been there before and said they really liked it the first time, but agreed that it wasn't as good this time. So maybe an off day for them? I have to admit that might make me come back and try it one more time.  Hard to pass up some great (and MUCH better) pizza at Cibo, North, and Bianco in order to come back though. But maybe if I am desperate, I'll give it another shot.",

    "text": "Ate at the restaurant today to compare pizza with other restaurants in Phoenix.  Ordered the Contadina pizza, Donna Rosa pizza, Caesar salad, and the antipasto meat tray. The service was good. The pizza was okay. Having lived in Italy for 3 years we know what authentic Italian pizza taste like. What is somewhat ironic is that the word Pomo is the name brand of an Italian tomato puree that is used on most of the pizza in northern Italy. The restaurant didn't seem to use as much of that authentic puree than might be indicated by its name. The middle of the crust was a bit soggy, but it did have slightly scorched crust that you would expect on real Italian pizza.  The meat cheese and olive antipasto platter was a bit disappointing. It may be that I am spoiled by the butcher's block at  il Postino restaurant.  Variety of meat was good but only one type of cheese and one type of olive were part of the platter.  The pizza at Pizza a Metro is much more authentic to northern Italy then Pomo and is far less expensive.",

    "text": "Mio Dio, this review is LONG overdue. I am so lucky that these guys are so close. This is one of the places I like to go when I am missing Europe. These charming little spot oozes Neapolitan charm from the atmosphere to the mouthwatering pizza, salads and pasta.  These guys are definite top contenders for best pizza joint in The Valley in my opinion. Don't get me wrong: I LOVE Bianco, The Parlor and my beloved Bocce up in Cottonwood, but there is something about this place that really stands out for me and I think it is the European atmosphere.  Lisa E. dragged me in here one weekend and I am eternally indebted to her for that. The first thing I noticed it that I heard a LOT of Italian being spoken-ALWAYS a good sign!  I had the Pomo, what can I say, I'm simple and predictable. It was like having fresh meat and veggies, fresh cheese and savory sauce on a fresh baked crust sent from heaven. I'm not a pizza guy, I will NEVER suggest going out for pizza but these guys are an exception. Their pizza is not too heavy which is how a lot of pizza places utterly fail and the freshness and quality of ingredients is what really sets Pomo apart.   I've also had the lasagne bolognese. Again, I'm not a huge fan of lasagne again because it is often so damned rich and heavy. Pomo pulls it off brilliantly AND they give you so much that you have lunch for tomorrow!  They have amazing salads which are huge and full of lush, fresh veggies and their bruschetta is to die for.  Lastly, their coffee kicks ass. This is what really takes me back to Europe: amazing, AUTHENTIC Italian Espresso. I WISH these guys were open in the morning because I would come here for coffee EVERY DAY!  The space is great: they have an awesome little bar and a patio for the months when it's nice outdoors and some counter seating where you can watch your meal being prepared.  If you haven't been here, put Pomo on your 2015 list to check out. If you're from out of town, these guys are not to be missed!",

All of the pizzas are super thin crust Neapolitan style, made in their wood fired oven using oak, and mostly using imported Italian ingredients.  We shared the Peppino pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, spicy salame, basil, evoo) and it was so deeply flavorful.  Highly recommended!",

The first cut corner was the bread, in previous visits it was a great, fresh inhosue bread. This time the bread was stale, and looked like stanrd slices from a bag, which we were also charged an extra $1.50 for since we were nnot told one came with our salad.  The next cut corner was the mango salad, the mangoes had that freezer taste and were a bit mushy. I understand some ingredients are seasonal so maybe the menu should adjust.  The pizza, is the shining star as it should be. The margarita pizza, with the amazing sauce that is not sweet, thin and crisp crust and melted but not overpowering mozzarella was great.

    "text": "I have given this place 2/5 because I think it has potential to do better and be something good but here is what I got from my experience...  I ordered take out from here using Uber eats and was super underwhelmed. After looking over pictures of their food posted on yelp, I ordered what would be potentially a new pizza spot as I had just moved in not too far away. I ordered the bruschetta trio and the peppino pizza.  The bruschetta trio, which is suppose to be 3 distinct different types of bruschetta came as a two piece duo. Not only was there one of the three missing, but the two that were present were the exact same type. The two identical bruschetta in this duo was comprised of what was on its way to being two lonely pieces of old bread that had a mountain of tomato dumped onto them and had a few pieces of soggy cilantro within the tomato clump. The next item was the peppino pizza. That was actually decent, their dough and spicy salami made the pizza but the absence of cheese that was replaced with grease was disappointing especially after seeing the photogenic photos posted on previous yelp reviews. Even when considering what was good about the pizza, the price point of that pizza was definitely above the quality of what was delivered. Definitely upset that the first place I tried after moving into the neighborhood was a huge let down. With so much food competition in downtown Phoenix, they completely dropped the ball to gain a customer.  Since yelp has encouraged me to write more, I present what I hope the company's manager and web designer will find.   Somewhere down the line this restaurant has lost its recipe of what is \"AUTHENTIC NEAPOLITAN PIZZA HANDCRAFTED IN THE TRADITION OF OLD ITALY.\" The signature style of Pomo Pizzeria definitely did not create an unparalleled pizza experience. In fact it very well blended into the mediocre pizza that is available on every other corner. The absence of their advertised authentic flavors is clear, but it also hurts their proclaimed techniques handed down over generations which after eating that can't be more than a child attempting to work in the kitchen for the first time. Their ingredients and pizza making process will not take you on a journey to discover Neapolitan pizzas unless it's through the steps of screwing up how to make pizza and decided \"whatever, let's give it to paying customers anyway.\" What ever \"True tradition\" that goes back hundreds of years and thousands of miles to Napoli, Italy is not present at this location and I wouldn't be surprised if it was absent from their pizza chain.  The Pomo family recipe has taken a hit in quality if this is what is to be expected. I hope whoever certified you by the Verace Pizza Napoletana and Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani, you find a way back to your authentic Italian dining experience outside of Italy itself.",

    "text": "New to the state, last week I decided to try some of the popular restaurants in the downtown area. I had one of the worst experiences, let me share a bit of my night .  There were some art shows and presentations down Roosevelt Street, I believe it is called \"First Friday\". Walked past a cute little building and saw it was Pomo and remembered that was on my list for places to try out. We get there and it is relatively busy as I would expect on a Friday night, the hostess was nice and very kindly cleaned a table for us to sit in. It took about 10 minutes plus for someone to bring us water. Then she finally came back and seemed extremely stressed (not to mention this was the first time I have ever seen a waitress wear a mini jean skirt and an apron) I was very shocked they allowed her to wear that as everyone else was wearing black jeans or work pants. We had been sitting there for over 20 minutes and were very ready for some food. I ordered a glass of wine and a pizza Margherita. The pizza came out within 5 min yet my glass still never arrived. A tall man who seemed to be the manager walked by us looked at the table, didn't greet us nor notice we had no extra plates or silverware on the table. I had to wave down the hostess and she kindly brought us the silverware and some oils and pepper flakes.  I was nearly done with my meal when the waitress finally returned to checked back up on us. I told her my wine never arriving and she just gave me a strange look, I believe she just never put it in. After reminding her about my glass she still didn't offer to get me the drink. I was very annoyed but trying to keep my calm, it was noticeable english wasn't her first language but I don't think I was too difficult to understand my order.  After that she started coming to check on us a bit more often since she noticed I wasn't in a very good mood. A big table beside us had just left and I noticed she did not help pick up a single cup both times she went out there. The hostess cleared the whole table, seemed like that young girl and the kitchen were the only ones working.  This isn't even the worst part yet. I went into the ladies room and there is a horrible oder, seem like someone couldn't hold it and pooped on the ground. The worst part is that it looked like someone tried to just clean it with paper towels instead of giving it a proper clean. I could not finish my business, I quickly left and told my husband to pay in cash so we could just get out of this place as quickly as possible. I hate not leaving a proper tip but I do not believe she even earned any of what we did leave her.   I was extremely disappointed with my experience, the food was very good, saddly I can't actually leave a rating based on just that.",

    "text": "This was a great experience for me.  My co-worker and I were in the area for training, and got in pretty late.  Luckily, Pomo Pizzeria was close to my co-worker's hotel, so we were able to walk on over at around 8 pm on a Sunday night to get some food.  Service was excellent; all smiles and they were able to seat us pretty quickly.    We quickly ordered two of the pizzas suggested by the server; excellent!  The pizza with the charcuterie had awesomely fresh ingredients, and it was just a unique menu item.  Definitely didn't make me feel fat!  We then had the pizza with different cheeses on the white crust.  VERY tasty.  Once again, fresh ingredients, and it just tasted wholesome.    We also got canolis!  One order comes with 3 mini canolis, all of different flavors.  I think one was pistacchio for sure, and another vanilla (?).  I completely forgot the last flavor.  All 3 flavors weren't too sweet, but it hit my co-worker's canoli craving (say that 3 times fast) straight on.    I think the owner or the manager of the venue also came by and gave us shots of a wonderful vanilla liqueur.  I was expecting it to be bitter like most alcohols, but it was actually very sweet and smooth.  Perfect way to end the night.  Props to the clean restaurant, beautiful decor, excellent service and management, and of course, delicious food.  Will try and come back here whenever I'm back down in Phoenix.  Loved it!",

We enjoyed our server who spoke with a heavy Italian accent. She made some suggestion and we chose the Pomo pizza, lasagna and a starter of eggplant parmigiana. The eggplant was so tasty, wished I had more! The lasagna was good, not the best we've ever had, BUT the pizza crust was so yummy!! Would definitely go back for pizza when in the area. Only bad part is you have to pay to park.",

It was my first time visiting the restaurant itself, I had made a reservation for two a day prior. Upon arriving I noticed they had all the doors and windows open even tho it was in the 90's outside. Flies kept buzzing around our food and drinks the entire time. Unfortunately at one point we had to leave a slice of pizza due to a fly sitting on it. It was hot, the A/C inside was working but it didn't mask the heat. Also, maybe the waitress was having a bad day but she was very short with us. At one point she just stared at us as we looked over the menu not saying a word until she said \"Are you ready yet?\". She just walked up, waited, staring as if we were wasting her time. My friend then said please and she went off to talk with the rest of the staff and came much later to take our order. Again, food is great, service not so much.",

The Diavola, a 12 inch amalgamation of dough, tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, and spicy salame. Let me say the spicy salame makes this dish spectacular! Personally I think you could put this salame on anything for an amazing result. Achieving this perfection only takes 90 seconds of cook time in their 900 degree brick oven. It's easy to see why Italians choose this place as their Arizona location to remind them of pizza back home. Definitely ask for extra salame because you will love this pizza!",

Having tried the pizza at many of the valley's \"top spots\", Pomo is my favorite.   I would rank it above any other pizza I've had the pleasure of enjoying in Arizona, maybe even anywhere, and that includes the few pizzas I tried in Italy.   It's also worth mentioning that if you're a valley pizza snob like me, you've probably tried that certain place in downtown PHX that's received a lot of publicity and high praise from the press.  You know the one I'm talking about.  Well, my taste buds tell me that Pomo is the hands down winner in that race.    With a great big pizza oven right out in the open, a nice selection of apps, salads and pastas,  incredible selection of both red & white pizzas (or build-your-own), a great wine, cocktail and beer list, a great location and of course great service, Pomo checks ALL the boxes.    If you're lucky enough to dine there when the owner is in, you're likely to get a delicious special treat at the end of your meal as well, so cross your fingers and hope that's when you find yourself there.  Also, they can get quite busy during dinner hours so I've found that getting there between 5pm-5:30pm will typically get you sat right away.    Bon Appetit!!!",

So it wasn't until this time that I actually ventured inside.  The food itself warrants 5-stars. It is authentic and delicious. There will be endless debates the world over about what is the best pizza, what is the best style, what is the best crust. We all have our own opinions, but for me Neapolitan wins every time. The crisp, slightly chewy crust is amazing. The toppings are always fresh and plentiful. Now, it's not the cheapest pizza you will ever get, but, trust me, it is worth every penny. I'm sure it's not cheap to build an oven made from bricks and volcanic sand from Southern Italy.  Everyone here is so nice! From the greeters to the servers to the bartender. Even the cooks look happy in their work. My order wasn't quite ready when I arrived, but the greeter was quick, efficient and welcoming. When I sat at the bar and had a Peroni while waiting, the bartender was engaging and friendly.  I heard they have opened another two locations, so wherever you live, you are probably close to a Pomo Pizzeria. Do yourself a favor and go visit!",

My boyfriend is currently working in downtown Phoenix and I am getting a mini-vacation so my only job is finding places close by for dinner.  I often turn to yelpers for suggestions and thank you!  After reviewing the menu, our super sweet waitress, Ciara, was our go to decider.  Gotta love when the wait staff is honest and can help you with more than just making sure your drinks don't run out.  We started with Romana salad.  It was very close to a Caesar salad which when done right is one of boyfriend's favs.  The lettuce was crisp and no browning so very fresh.  The dressing coated every piece and yet  it was not heavy at all.    My bf is a major carnivore.  So when it comes to pizza, the greater the portion of meat equals greater happiness in his world.  That being said, we ordered the Toto Sapore pizza.  I typically have some kind of veggie on my pizza but I couldn't fault this choice one bit.  That pizza could probably make a vegetarian cry in their pillow at night!  Even though the crust may be said to be charred by some, the fact that I was eating a crust as thin as that and yet able to retain that softness you get from a \"regular\" one was like a miracle. The sauce was beautiful and not over seasoned.  It tasted like tomato!  We were tempted to order another but since we had salad and wanted dessert, we nixed that idea.  That had to one of the best decisions that we made.  I can't spell it for the life of me but that dessert melted my heart and worth every calorie it had.  It was these beautiful cream puffs covered in a rich chocolate mousse surrounded by clouds of another sweetened cream.   Overall, living in south Chandler, I would easily make the trek to return to this place.  Though next time, I am gonna skip lunch so I can have the room for more pizza!!",

    "text": "There is no words that can describe just how delicious the pizza was! I was blown away by the abundance of flavors, my tummy was content and my taste buds loved me!   We started off with a bruschetta. Simple bruschetta, nothing fancy, still tasty. My boyfriend ordered the Toto Sapore. Packed with lots of different meats, sausage, prosciutto, pancetta, and salame! Perfect choice for meat lovers. I opted for the Peppino which included ricotta cheese and salame. The crust was perfect! The tomato sauce really made the whole pizza to be honest. Not too thick and a good amount to still enjoy the rest of the ingredients. You MUST, MUST, MUST try your pizza with the chili infused olive oil. It's amazing! I wanted to take it home and use it for every meal.   Lastly, the desserts. My, oh my...those desserts. The owner was kind enough to bring us a dessert on the house which was fried pieces of dough sprinkled with confectioners sugar. He also poured us a shot of something with cinnamon, sooooo tasty! Very strong, but the flavor was delicious. We went ahead and each ordered a dessert. My boyfriend got the Tiramisu and I got the Semifredo Alle Mandorle. My dessert was a traditional Italian dessert light mousse filled with figs and topped with amaretto cookies. That description alone just sounds mouth watering, no detail on the amazingness of that dessert needed!   I'm excited to have found my new favorite pizza spot! I will return soon for the sandwiches! :)",

The space is bigger than it looks from the street, with a beautiful brick oven. It gives off a fun, hip, yet romantic ambiance. We ordered 2 pizzas from their traditional pizza menu and we both loved them. We had a delicious grapefruit italian soda in a cool, vintage-y bottle. And the kicker? They brought us a FREE dessert because we casually mentioned to our server that it was our first time here. And the owner brought out the dessert himself. Now that is impressive. Oh, and he brought out free shots of some limoncello vodka drink! It makes you feel special to get that much attention! I will be back again and again!",

I think they skimped on basil for one pizza but did good with arugula on another. Two friends ordered tomato soup, and they both really liked it. One picked up the bowl and slurped it clean. Owner? comes around and offered some treats at the end of our meal which was a nice touch.   The restaurant is not large and I can imagine there'd be a wait during peak hours.   Not a 5-star experience because: parmesan and oregano were brought out after a whole pizza was already eaten, staff looked really tired/disgruntled when they walked around, and the bathroom was pretty dirty with towels all over the floor. Not big deals but things for the restaurant to work on.",

This type of pizza is not my personal favorite, but what I do know is that it was cooked perfectly, and the ingredients used made it feel like I was sitting in a small village, eating cured meats and chesse from someone who had made it all themselves.  The fact that the owner was in the store cooking my pizza created that feeling of authenticity, that when paired with my italian wine (great choices from all over Italy on the menu), made it feel for just a moment like I was not in sizzling Phoenix.    To be transported away, if but only for a moment by the experience of eating food, is one of the greatest pleasures of dining, and Pomo Pizzeria gave me that experience.    A happy 4 stars.",

I had never had brie on a pizza before, and this rendition of it was delicious. The size of the pizza was pretty large as well as I could barely finish mine. I am usually not a fan of thinner crust pizza but this has got to be one of my favorite non-deep dish places I've ever eaten at.

They use imported San Marzano tomatoes and imported moz and they blend together in this perfect way that packs far more flavor into a three topping pizza than you would ever guess.   Our server was fantastic, the meat plate we started with was top notch, and the pizzas take barely 90 seconds in the 900 oven, so they come out crisp but not scalding hot, which was just fine for us.  We had a lot of fun, and for $14 for a pizza with enough to share for two (especially with a light appetizer), we'll definitely be back. A lot.",

    "text": "When I first was pulling up to Pomo's, I was a little mislead. It was fairly close to Arizona State University and was close to the center of downtown Phoenix so I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. The restaurant was not as big as I thought it was going to be, however, that did not change the fact that the food was amazing. The only negative part about going to this Pomo's is you have to be prepared to pay $5 for parking unless you want to park far away. Nonetheless, the parking is right outside of the restaurant so it is not a far walk at all.   As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was immediately seated. There was a fantastic Italian smell there that really gives you the full experience of the food. The menu was quite confusing if I'm being completely honest. It took my friend and I only a few minutes to decide what we wanted to eat but the waitress checked up on us a few times to make sure we were still doing alright. When it came to ordering, I had to ask the waitress to help me understand the menu but she was very nice and helpful.  The food was delivered within 10 minutes of ordering it and when it came out, it looked fantastic. I ordered pizza and if definitely looked professionally made. They did not have ranch which was kind of disappointing but I guess with a place as good as Pomo's you don't need the ranch. When I needed a refill, the waitress literally came over as soon as I set my cup down to come refill my drink. All in all, the service was great, the food was great, and the overall environment was great.",

My daughter and I ordered a salad and pizza to split and while we were eating our salad I noticed about 5 employees staring at us.  Like consistently staring to the point I was uncomfortable.   I realized then that we were the only table left and they were closed.  I asked the waitress and she confirmed they closed at 2pm but not to worry because she has nowhere to be and we could take our time.   After we finished our salad we had two people immediately clear everything from our table.  Thought it was odd but figured they would re-set it before the pizza comes.  A few mins later a lady came back and was very rude and said that she thought we were leaving and re-set the table.    Our pizza came and everyone was still staring and made us feel so uncomfortable that we shoveled the pizza down and got the check.  Again, our table was cleared so quickly and it was very obvious they were rushing us out.  It was 2:15pm when I paid and we left, not that far past closing.    I don't know how to rate the food, we ate it so quickly that we barely tasted it.  I think the pizza might have been fabulous but it really sucks I couldn't enjoy it.  I paid $30 for lunch (including tip) and I couldn't enjoy it and am now stuck with horrible indigestion from eating so quickly.    Lesson learned, don't go right before closing!  If I go back,  I will re-review this place and hopefully give it more stars!",

It really gives Phoenix a city feel - something Phoenix tends to lack. I recommend the Pizza Chef and Romana salad. Another ++  portions are big enough that you can potentially share and not walk out stuffed.  The only recommendation I have is mounting the dining room tables, it is almost like a maze walking through the dining area and the tables move easily.   I can't wait for Pomo to open in Glendale!",

The sauce also tasted canned, which is fine, but at least spice it up a bit with some Italian herbs, right? I also wish the basil had been added fresh and not cooked on top. The crust was good though and the owner was very friendly.",

    "text": "Talk about AMAZING, this place knocked my socks off!   The Phoenix location is not a very big restaurant but it has HUGE character. I sat outside because it was a lovely evening and a little quieter too. The service was excellent, our glasses did not go dry and our plates promptly cleared when finished. The waitress was on the ball and did not leave us for to long but let us alone enough to enjoy our evening.    I started the meal with the Romana Insalate which was romaine lettuce with Pomo's home dressing and shaved parmigiano cheese. The salad was fresh, the dressing superb and the shaved cheese topped it off nicely. The portion is large enough to share with another.   For the main dish I had the Bufala Verace which was a step up from the normal margherita style pizza. It had the freshest sauce and imported bufala mozzarella that was so creamy it just melted in my mouth. Topped with fresh basil too, seriously this pizza was something to write home about. WoW does not even come close to the awesomeness that danced on my tongue!  Dessert was molto perfetto!! The tiramisu is worth getting, the portion is gigantic and is definitely a share with your friends dessert. It was light and sweet and the berries on the side added to the perfect mix with the coffee and chocolate flavors.  The owner is such a sweet man, at the end of our meal he offered some of his homemade limoncello. It was a sweet, creamy lemon mixture with a hint of vanilla (i think.) He should really put this amazing stuff over vanilla bean ice-cream and berries, it would make a great dessert.     This evenings meal could not have been any better. I wholeheartedly recommend trying this place, you will not be disappointed!",

I was handed a dirty, torn menu right off the bat (it even had summer specials even though it was fall). That is enough indication of the amount of care put into a restaurant. We then had to ask for a waitress when no one attended us in a reasonable amount of time. When she came by, she was not in the least bit welcoming. We ordered drinks hoping it was just a fluke. Nope...the poor attitude continued when our orders arrive and we were asked what we wanted to order. We decided against eating here, paid for our drinks and headed to the Chamber's next door - where we had an amazing time. Pomo's was such a waste of time.",

I'm really picky when it comes to pizza or italian food as most places tend to put way too much sugar in their marinara.    A friend and I wanted to try some place neither of us had been and I'd heard good things about this place from some friends so I decided to give it a try.  We ordered a salad, pizza and a couple drinks.  We were both blown away with not only the service but the food as well.    There are a couple of artisan pizza places not that far from Pomo that get a lot of attention but I'm honestly not a fan.  Pomo is hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ.",

    "text": "Remember when Pomo used to occupy that touristy faux-Mediterranean space in the most upscale part of Scottsdale?  They served one of the best Napoletana pizzas I have ever had in one of the most pretentious, snooty atmospheres imaginable.  I am thrilled to report that my experience with the downtown Pomo was not at all the same.  Having just walked from Cibo, where we enjoyed a decent pie (I'm still not convinced that Cibo comes anywhere close to its level of hype), we stepped into Pomo, expecting to be lambasted with stucco, fake accents, and photos of Florence.  Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be... trendy?  That's right, it was modern decor, and the waitstaff was of the hipster variety.  Wow, that was unexpected!  My biggest problem with the original store had been taken care of.  This was turning out to be an excellent dining experience.  We then ordered our pie, expecting the same quality we had enjoyed from the old Scottsdale oven.  Nope.  What happened?  The pizza was not adequately soupy.  It lacked the amazing flavor and attention to detail that made it somewhat worthwhile to brave Scottsdale's most self-absorbed patrons.  In short, it was underwhelming.   After we left here, we proceeded to walk right down the street to La Piazza Locale (also VPN certified), for our third and best pie of the evening.  I suggest you do the same.  They have the same modern vibe with a much better Napoletana pie.",

I came in here determined to eat a nice salad to go right along with my diet, ahem, \"lifestyle change.\"  Well, of course, that went out the window the second I stepped into this delicious establishment and caught a peek of the pizza on the table next to us.  I did end up ordering the mango salad and the Capricciosa pizza. The crust was thin, crunchy, yet soft. It had all the ingredients that lead up to perfection. More than anything, it was the great service that I was excited about. The owner came and greeted us and brought us water right away. He answered all of our questions. The server was awesome as well.   The place was very cute with a Vespa theme. I'd like to come back in the evening for dinner and see how different the ambiance is at night. I will definitely be going back to try a different pizza.",

    "text": "This is an \"official-authentic\" Italien restaurant, and I frequent it regularly. But it is not just basic - it is gourmet.  My favorite waitress is Marie, and she waited on me today. She should probably be given some sort of award or something as the best waitress I have ever had.   There is LIVE basil hanging on the wall. For real. Just walk up and see for yourself.   The olive oil is unbelievable.   I giant copper covered Pizza oven adds to the environment.   If you care, the salads are all organic. And the optional chicken on the salads is organic raised.   They have both gluten free and regular food.   I have never had anything that was less than \"unbelievably good\" at this restaurant.   On the other side of the restaurant is a small cafe that opens in the morning before the main restaurant. (Cafe is closed Sunday) It is the best expresso machine in Scottsdale, with the owner of the restaurant (sometimes) who actually knows how to make a real expresso or cappuccino. You should understand how rare this is. Note: The express or coffee you get in the main restaurant comes from the same expresso machine.   The pasteries remind me of being back in Italy.   You are not going to find an Italien place like this very often.   *Please take it easy on the wait staff, and please give them positive feedback when you write a review. These folks work hard, and are subject to a lot of reviews online, because this restaurant is growing in popularity.  One night I took my entire staff to eat here, and we were treated like royalty, even though the place was super busy.   Warning:  The one negative thing I would say is that Pomo's destroys the Pizza-eating experience for me when I go to other pizza restaurants. When I try eating what passes for pizza elsewhere, I just think to myself \"this is definitely not Pomo's. ; - )   - Russell Wright",

The dressing for the salad was better balanced than most places which I definitely noticed (my tongue is very sensitive to acidic and salty food).  The pizza was tasty, though it had a bit too much ash and burn on it for my taste.  The pizza also had a tough time holding together for bites, smaller pieces of prosciutto should help.    The free limoncello shots and powder sugar dusted fried dough were a nice touch to make this place stand out.    I think I like Cibo better, but this place is a solid second for this type of pizza.",

    "text": "Not sure what was up with their bar service; maybe only one person was 21 or over but our party on a Friday late afternoon/evening had a nearly impossible time getting drink orders as well as getting them correct!  We were a large party but they knew we were coming days in advance.  They had us out on the patio but the patio bar was not open (???) and all orders had to be taken inside to the main bar.  Some in our group had the pizzas and were apparently satisfied because I didn't see any of it go back but they have got to do something about the service or at least explain to folks what's going on (we humans can be very understanding)",

    "text": "I was told that this was the best pizza in Phoenix. The Yelp reviews make it seem like a winner. This is hands down the WORST pizza I've ever had. It was dripping more than an ice cube in the desert. I have no idea why the pizza was so moist, with the brick oven I expected a crispy and delicate pizza. But what landed on our table needed a shop vac to suck up whatever random liquid was coming from this undercooked pie. I've come to the conclusion that Arizona and its people have no idea what good food is. Enjoy your crap.",

The Pizza is amazing, authentic ingredients, and authentic tastes. The atmosphere is also good as it is easy to be comfortable and relaxed here especially with guests. The decor is Italian, the waiters speak Italian, and the alcohol is Italian. Try the tiramisu it will blow your mind.",
