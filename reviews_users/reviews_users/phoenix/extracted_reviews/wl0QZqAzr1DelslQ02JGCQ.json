They had good music playing too.  Waitress was very nice, Started off with some car bombs, $3 anytime, great deal.  Ordered some food and got some beers and about 5 or 10 minutes after than the waitress informed us that she forgot to put in our order.  So she gave us 2 free car bombs.  Nice, the food came out quickly after that so I was pretty happy she forgot about the order.    Food was very good, i liked the spicy asiago chicken, could have been spicier.  My girlfriend said she enjoyed the italian.  Overall, great place for relatively cheap priced food and drinks.",

    "text": "Cornwall native Dean Thomas had a major hit when he deciced to open The Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe, AZ. A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties (say \"Pass-Tee\"), unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond.  Lunch or dinner will cost you less than $10.00 (without the beer) and the variety is a bit staggering. From the traditional Oggie with beef, onions, potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy, to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice, potatoes, lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying.  We have been visiting this hidden wonder for a couple of years now and have tried most of the items on the menu. (Except for the vegetarian pasties which we just have not gotten to yet.) It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!  If you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you. Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch! Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guiness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.  The current location is quite small however and it's proximity to ASU guarantees a packed house on Friday and Saturday nights. Happily, Dean is opening a second location in Mesa on Doson Rd. and Guadalupe Rd. that will not only be larger but has a more open environment as well. Opening has been announced for Saturday, January 17th 2009 and you can bet we'll be there.  Take the time to find The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again!",

They have a well-developed vegetarian menu, and for those who eat meat there are even more choices.  I also love that there are a few dessert versions of the pasty as well, the bonoffee pie is mouth euphoria.  Quite a hipster place though, and seating is mostly only for parties of 2 or 3.  And also, don't expect to get top notch attentive service, because a lot of the servers will be busy just hanging out.  But the food basically makes up for all the bad.",

Don't get me wrong, the pasties are great, but there are a few reasons why this place isn't a four star restaurant:  1) It's overpriced.  You're paying almost 15 bucks for a lunch originally meant for miners. 2) It's cramped.  Good luck going there with more than one other person. 3) It's a little dingy.  Someone said the atmosphere is great.... Huh?  Not sure why a dark dining room that is six feet wide and crowded can be considered a nice atmosphere, unless maybe you grew up in a sewer.  Also, make sure you get there early if you want a table or food in a reasonable amount of time.",

There is very limited seating so we usually go before 11:45 or after 1pm if it's a lunch rendezvous.  The food is amazing and unless you're from the UP, chances are you haven't had anything like it.  There are a ton of different pasty options.  Every time I look over the menu, it's like Christmas all over again.    Service can be a tad slow, but I realize that perfection isn't pre-made.  The beer selection is outstanding as well.  The staff is solid, very polite, and usually showcase a nice selection of body ink.  Don't be scared to try some apps or lighter fare.  EVERYTHING there is great.  Also, they offer half cooked Pastys.  So you can swoop in grab them and finish cooking at your leisure.  Although I usually like posting up a the bar and taking in the great crowd and atmosphere.    It's a weekly stop for me and I don't see that slowing anytime soon.  I also frequent the location in Mesa (corner of Dobson and Guad).  It's a much larger location with a slighty more upscale feel.  Same great food and service.",

I mean, it's just a hot pocket...right? WRONG. First off, their menu does not just consist of pasties. They have a handful of salads that looked delicious and sides. I started with a cup of their potato leek soup. The flavors were so intense and rich. I enjoyed every spoonful. I also tried the mushroom walnut spinach and that was also beyond delicious. Finally it came time to select our pasty. This time I split the asiago chicken. Trust me, splitting was a good choice. I don't think I could finish one on my own. The asiago chicken was full of flavor. It was spicier than I expected, but the sour cream dulled the heat. Nevertheless, it was delicious.   We ran out of time so we didn't get to try dessert, but that is just another reason to come back.",

Since I ate them I had read up on them a bit and understand that they are a traditional British favorite, made of uncooked meats and vegetables baked into a pie shell. But, I still had my doubts...  I hesitantly ordered the Oggie -- my server told me it was the most traditional -- and my Significant Other chose the Lamb and Mint (?). The restaurant had an upscale \"vibe\" --- entertaining cooks, nice servers, smiling diners, and interesting music on the satellite radio. The prices were very reasonable and the portions HUGE.

These glorified hot pockets (crispy, tender, flaky crust!) are filled with such nu-American classics as Pesto Chicken and mushrooms, steak and potatoes, and even the good ole' fashioned PB&J. Beer list is good and the wines and liquors are decent. This place gets pretty hoppin', but there isn't that long of a wait on busy nights. I love getting their roast potatoes on the side, and they are incredibly vegan/vegetarian friendly. However, no substitutions can be made as those are pre-made and frozen, which is part of why they only get 3 stars. The food is more of a 3.5, but their Tempe ASU clientele can be a little on the annoying/loud side, so I took off .5 stars for lack of atmosphere. This location is also quite small, but they do take-out and are open late.",

So when I got out of the car and looked at the place my friend had taken me, I know that the question \"what the heck is a pasty and why is there a company for them?\" went through my head.  I looked at the menu (I even read the little history blurb) and still had no clue.  So, when a wee calzone-like pasty comes out, filled with the making of a Reuben sandwich, I was very intrigued.  Compared to my hunger, this thing looked puny.  But the smell, the steam, and crispiness of the pastry itself were just too good to be disappointed.  I was not at all displeased.  There is a HUGE menu of these things too!  There is a page of classic ones, signature ones, and even vegetarian ones.  The place itself is dark and cozy with a unique diner/bar charm.  Don't pass this place up.",

This is a dark restaurant, one that puts you in the kitchen. Literally. If you find yourself disturbed by seeing real kitchen professionals running around, then avoid this place.   Walking in, I felt like I was going into a dive bar. All of the kitchen staff is motley, and I loved it. We took two seats at the bar, and were greeted by an awesome server. She got us Guinness (poured perfectly, that gets a star), and we got to check out the menu.  Vast, is a good phrase for this menu. If you haven't had a Pasty before, I like to think of it as a Hot Pocket that doesn't make you want to die.  I got the Cottage Pie Pasty, and my friend got the Italian Pasty.   Our pasties were served on very distinct metal plates, with a sauce side. I had a red wine gravy, which was incredible. Tart and not thick at all. It was excellent. My friend had a marinara, he replied that it had a nice spice to it.  The food was excellent. My Pasty was filled with ground beef, potatoes, peas ,carrots, and cheese.  Warm, gooey, and it felt good being in there.  That is what I would say is the key to this place. You have to love it. You have to love feeling of the warmth every time the oven is opened, along with the following scent of roasted herbs and spices. The staff, rushing around, looking more like roadies than cooking professionals.  This place is real. It's alive. And it's good. Check out the menu, and go there. I will be going as much as possible.",

My friend got the original pasty, and this was also good-- perfect for people who have a mellower palate.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, people seem to love to work here, and they also love their facial hair-- our server was rockin a great hipster moustache.

I even ordered one to go for family at home so they could try. Will definitely be back!",

The interior is like a dive bar with little to no lighting, not what you'd expect from a pasty place, and it looks closed from the outside. Don't let that put you off - the pasties are fantastic which is why it gets 5 starts from me! Extensive selection of vegetarian and even a few vegan choices, plus creative flavor combos. I've eaten many a Cornish pasty in my time, having frequented Cornwall quite a few times while growing up. These are really really good! The pastry is excellent and the fillings generous. My favorites are the Veggie \"Chicken' Tikka Masala, Veggie Asiago \"Chicken\", and Veggie Mexican. They even ship...hmm, tempting!",

    "text": "The food is amazing! The ambience is unique. The service is...friendly.  Literally for a year or two, I had a friend telling me to come to Cornish Pasty Company. He made it a point to visit this place every time he came into town, and he felt strongly that I should do the same. Now that I'm actually living in town, I made this happen. And I must say, I'm sad it took me this long to get there, because I've been missing out!  First off, a pasty is a wonderful, flaky pocket of deliciousness. It's like the best pot pie crust wrapped completely around a variety of different combinations. The crust alone is fantastic, and when you put those fillings in it, I couldn't get enough.  When I walked into this place, I kind of wondered where I had gotten myself. The Tempe location is nearly pitch black inside. On a positive note, it's a nice place to go in the middle of the hot summer here, because it was nice and cool inside. There's also a nice porch to eat outside if the weather permits. Seating is on a \"help yourself\" basis, and I think this may lend itself towards the servers not necessarily noticing you immediately. That's what happened to us, both at the beginning and the end of our meal.  I had the Pilgrim pasty, which is essentially a Thanksgiving meal all wrapped inside a pastyl. It has turkey, grilled onions, sweet potatoes, chicken, and stuffing, and is served with a red wine gravy and cranberry sauce. I'm a sucker for cranberry sauce and for Thanksgiving in general, and this totally hit the spot! Normally I'd have been in a bit of a spot trying to decide among the various delicious-sounding options, but when I saw this one, I knew I had to have it. One of my friends had the Meat and Cheese pasty, and it was solid as well.  I just looked at the menu again as I was writing this, and my mouth is watering now. There are so many other great selections, and I'm eager to get back and try more.  In summary, great food and unique atmosphere, but don't be in a rush, because the service isn't all that speedy.",

    "text": "When I first started researching some food options for my trip to Arizona, Cornish Pasty Company kept popping up. At first I tried to ignore it, but eventually curiosity got the best of me. So many rave reviews about this  'glorified hot pocket'. I'm thinking, yes I like hot pockets, but I don't know if I could take that affinity to the restaurant level.   Cornish Pasty Company happened to be literally less than a mile from our hotel so we had to check it out. We got there right before the dinner rush and barely waited for a seat at the bar. I decided on the chicken tikka masala and the bf got the peppered steak. He was intrigued by the bleu cheese. We were both happy with our orders. There is a decent wait from the time you order, but just think of every minute going towards a perfectly baked pasty. Now I understand how people can compare it to a hot pocket. This is the epitome of hot pockets and I can't find the words to a description that justifies how good it is.   Our waitress and the kitchen guy we chatted up were both suuuper nice. The waitress was very attentive and quick. The place itself is pretty dark (literally, dim lighting) and has that euro dive bar feel to it. I enjoyed sitting at the bar, feeling like a local and watching the kitchen staff work those ovens.   The food alone would have gotten me to love them. To top it off, they have THREE DOLLAR irish car bombs!!! Their receipt even says \"IRISH CAR BOMB... F... YEAH\" haha, they definitely know what's up.   No doubt I'll be back for more the next time I'm in the area.",

When we got there it was really dark inside, almost like a throw back 70s lounge feel, especially with the music they played. We were told to sit anywhere. Our server was Sarah who was absolutely wonderful. She was really on the ball, a great server, and anticipated our needs in advance. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad, my friend got the Porky pasty. Our food came in a rather timely fashion despite it being a very busy Friday dinner rush. I enjoyed the salad, the portion was huge. The chicken was tasty and there was plenty of tomatoes, cukes and dressing (on the side). My friend really enjoyed the Porky and even took some home, as it was quite a lot. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of this place when we first walked in. The darkness really didn't convey fun and friendly but the service was great and so was the food so it more than made up for the initial shock I felt upon arriving. Sarah, keep being awesome, all servers could take a lesson from this gal.",

My girlfriend being an Ish is well familiar with this type of food, for me it was a first.  I have to say I really liked it. They did a great job serving it up. It was hot and very filling for sure. They had several choices for the Pasties. I chose the Steak and the Shepard Pie, both were very tasty. Teresa got the curry one which is was over the moon with. They also served a really good Salad ,the dressing was just right on it. As well and a Broc,cheese type vegtable side. Not bad at all.

The atmosphere in there is really interesting; walls and windows are painted black, good music with all different types playing.  The staff are very friendly, professional, and fun. I like that instead of wearing uniforms or name tags like most places, they are encouraged to wear normal street clothes which I think gives the place a moreto comfortable relaxed atmosphere.  Great selection of draft beers on hand behind the bar. I gave the meat and cheese a try, and was not disappointed! Really good combination of sausage and cheddar cheese inside a pastry. I will be visiting that place more often now for sure!",

Waited 5 minutes for a server to say hi and offer me a drink, another 15 to get some water and get my order taken. The server didn't know which Vegan Pasties were available that night so she checked, it was only the Vegan Greek Pasty (the menu stated at least two available on any given night). As a vegan, that was my option, so that I got (with a side of chips).   A good twenty minutes later everything comes out. The pasty was ok at first, full of sun-dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. About halfway through I bite into a huge chunk of Mozarella (not vegan) and put the rest down. The only vegan option available that night was in fact not vegan. Really guys? At least the chips were ok.  Waited a good twenty minutes after I was clearly done eating before my server offered a check and to-go box. Overall the service was extremely slow and inconsiderate (I didn't really feel welcome), the vegan food wasn't vegan, and I still paid $15.00 for what amounted to a sandwich and fries. Maybe it was an off night, and I know a lone customer isn't a top priority, but I wouldn't come back again.",

    "text": "On the recommendation of a co-worker, my husband and I decided to try this out.  We had checked out the website and menu, so knew what we wanted to try.   First thing, in a lot of pictures, the place looks really cramped and small...wrong!   When you first walk in, there's a narrow hallway with a bar on one side and small 2-seat tables on the other.  But, if you walk around the corner, it opens up into a pretty large dining room (there's also a bar in here), as well as a nice sized patio. We seated ourselves, and were immediately met by Hannah, our server.  She was friendly and made us feel welcome.  We perused the menu, but we both pretty much knew what we wanted.   I ordered \"The Pilgrim\" and my hubby ordered \"The Reuben\".  While we waited for our pasty's, we were able to enjoy the music playing.  Lots of our favorites, so the wait didn't seem like too long.   \"The Reuben\" is basically exactly what it sounds like...a reuben sandwich in a flaky wrap.  It was served with a side of 1000 island dressing.  My husband loved it, before I had a chance to ask for a bite...it was gone!! \"The Pilgrim\" is like a Thanksgiving dinner in a pasty.  It had roast chicken (during the holidays they serve it with roast turkey, but honestly, I couldn't tell the difference), sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions.  It was served with a side of cranberry sauce.  OMG!!!  It was delicious and moist.  The chicken was so juicy.   Each bite reminded me of the day after Thanksgiving sandwiches...only this wasn't leftovers.  I devoured it!  My husband, who doesn't like stuffing, kept saying that when we go back, he's gonna order it.  Delicious!!! The flakiness and flavor of the dough is wonderful.  Honestly, it's so moist and flavorful, you don't even need a sauce or condiment.  Most of the meals come with a red wine gravy on the side (and so did mine), but it definitely wasn't needed.  If I had ordered something with beef, it might have been a nice sauce to dunk a bite into, but like I said, it may not even be needed. We're definitely going to make our way back to Tempe for another taste of a pasty, and there are a lot of very interesting ones on the menu.  We can't wait to try more!",

The menu has so many choices that it is hard to decide what to get. I ordered The Pilgrim. My incorrect assumption was that the pasties would be heavy, doughy concoctions. In fact, the pastry itself is very light and flaky. The filling consisted of turkey, stuffing, and sweet potato. Imagine the best day-after-Thanksgiving sandwich you have ever tasted and you would have The Pilgrim. It came with a side of whole cranberry sauce and light gravy to smother all over the yumminess. Most importantly, it was obvious that the ingredients were fresh. No canned potatoes and gravy here.   The ONLY reason I do not rate this establishment with \"5-stars\" is because I want to try more items on the menu but if the rest of the food tastes like what I consumed today, I will raise it up.",

    "text": "Awesome location, both in Chandler/Mesa border and also the Tempe Location...   1st experience in about 2008 in tempe.. Lil crowded for lunch, but well worth it went a few times, then in 2010 experience Chandler/Mesa Newly opened, great look and roomy even though still packs the place, but what do you expect for the great food. Finally made it back out to the tempe location and WOW, they renovated and definitely more room, and guess what ? yes Crowded still..   I have tried almost every Non-Vegetarian Pasty, and loved them ALL.   Favorites are, Cheese Steak, Steak and cheese, Pepper Steak and the Adovada..   1 That i didn't like was a misplaced order on a very busy day and ended up somehow with shepherds pie pasty,, thinking that all the pasty's are great,, cant go wrong,, but should have known as i don't like any shepherds pie that it may be a bad call to keep it... lesson learned.   Working in area and hitting this place about once a week.  Keep up the great work !!!  OHHHH and the BEER..... great selection,, i suggest the RAJ IPA",

Piping hot and very flavorful. I liked the crunch from the walnuts and the bread was really fresh.    Lovely Bit of Salmon and the Reuben. Both very good. And still our favorites. Our server also brought out dessert very fast, as requested. Very great meal.   Non-smoking patio was a plus. There was a lot of out door heaters ready for colder nights too.",

I love coming here with friends for a great beer and a pasty! The decor is a mix of traditional pub fittings and industrial touches, and there's a pretty hip soundtrack on to match. The atmosphere and the servers are casual, but I can't say that I've had bad service here before. The pasties are fresh and flaky (note: they can take time to bake up!); the bread pudding took me to heaven: warm, chocolatey and oh so rich! I also recommend the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake.",

If you cannot appreciate Cornish Pasty Co you have some sort of problem dealing with restaurants.   They will not molly coddle and treat you like you are some sort of special patron. They are just too busy providing some of the best pasties ever created. Service is not what you come here for, pasties are!  Be sure to ask them what the Vegan selections are, they are usually pretty amazing. Especially if you put gravy on them! (The gravy is totally not vegan, neither am I...having evolved as an omnivore).   Now they have a patio, as well as more seating and a nice bike rack! Classing it up CP! Just kidding, this place is not classy, which is why it is so beautiful and amazing.",

    "text": "Ive been here multiple times and love their food. Living in california i come here at least once a month. Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked.   I sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.  Areas for improvement  The waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips.   They need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal!   Drinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 mins  Notification on food times (depends on who is working)   Challenge your servers to turn tables faster   Servers need to be smiling and social",

    "text": "I am writing this with both respect and frustration for this restaurant. Having spent time in the UK, I was familiar with the famous \"meal in a pastry\" that originates from the mining town of Cornwall.   Few restaurants compare when it comes to simplicity and variety. I have become addicted to the cajun with it's spicy chicken, ham, and cheesy goodness. My girlfriend always seems to order the veggie tikka masala. I have tried much of the menu, and as long as you stay with the pasties, you are fine. The potato dishes are sort of hit and miss. The cheesy one is sort of bland  and the curried potato lacks the crunchiness that would otherwise put it on a great tapas menu. Finally, I would add that the beer selection is quite good and offers several sizes of great draft beers from the British Isles.  So yeah, food is great, and for dine in the prices are decent. My big frustration, and the reason I am writing this has to do with my experience tonight. I have taken to ordering pasties to go because the wait staff is often slow or inattentive. This is normally fine because I can stay at home and watch a movie while I eat. Indeed, I have been trying to save money by ordering half-baked pasties, and in the past they have knocked a dollar off of each of the pasties I've ordered regardless of type. Tonight I ordered two half-baked pasties to take home and the woman operating the cash register refused to give me the usual dollar off. Very, very annoying and this is the sort of inconsistency in the staff that keeps me from awarding five stars. Food=great, service=less than stellar.",

    "text": "You know when you have those days where you think \"diet? what diet?\" Yeah, those are the days that I go to the Cornish Pasty Company. Because what is a pasty if not a bread pocket stuffed with all the world's delights and 1,000 calories? Well, maybe not 1,000 calories, but it's close- it's also worth it!   Prior to abandoning meat, my favorite was the royale with cheese (minus the shrooms please). My favorite food in the entire world used to be a round patty of ground beef, sandwiched between two sesame seed buns until I discovered this little treasure. A pocket stuffed with ground beef, cheese,  grilled onions (and get this) french fries!! It honestly doesn't get any better than this. That is of course, until I became a vegetarian.  Now my favorite guilty pleasure has become the cheese and onion pasty. Packed with potatoes, rutabega, cheese and onions, and lots of ketchup on the size. Even though I know all the sodium will cause me to bloat up like a blimp later, I just can't resist eating it all in one sitting. There's a robust vegetarian menu, featuring Quorn brand mock-meat which has been delicious each time I've tried it.   And every now and then, when you're determined to stay on the old diet wagon, but everyone in your lunch meeting wants pasties, fear not, they do have a salad menu! The pasta salad is super yummy, and comes with the option of adding meat if you're looking for some additional protein.  Bottom line, there really is something for everyone at the Cornish Pasty Co. If you haven't tried it yet, do it!",

I kid you not their tandoori wings and cheese broccoli were also surprisingly delicious!  Food-wise, great. I tried their shepherd's pie pasty and it was just so savory and flavorful. We completely devoured the perfectly seasoned and grilled tandoori chicken wings. The cheese broccoli was just another way to ramp up our fat and calorie intake without any regrets.  Love the vibe there. People were all chilling and staff were friendly. It was kind of confusing at first. It was not easy to find, being tucked in the corner at the back with no bright signs or large entrance. We managed to locate this restaurant. When we walked in, we didn't know who the host/ess was, so we had to wait at the entrance to see if anyone would come and greet us. Finally a waitress walked to us and seat us at a picnic table outside. There were at least two large community tables out there, and people, probably mostly students, were just hanging out, drinking, eating and having fun. It's just a very relaxing way to spend the night.  Great place to eat and hang out! Prices were pretty reasonable too.",

The furniture is nice but not super comfy, and the tables are decorated in a very interesting way. The food is innovative, and their pasties definitely stand out. I've tried a number of them, and two of my favorites are the lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka masala. Service can be a little slow, especially during the busy hours of lunch and dinner, but it's worth it. Their soups and salads are great too, and highly recommended. I've even had their pasties to go sometimes, since they are one of the very few places that are open till midnight everyday. Great work guys!",

I would recommend asking for 2 of the salsa rather than one Salsa and one sour cream.  I am not a drinker so can not tell you about the beer and wine selection.   The food is highly recommended for a change in burgers and pizza.   Will be back soon",

The Cornish Pasty Company is offers over 50 different Pasties! I came in on a late Thursday night near closing time and there were still a good amount of people inside. They didn't seem irritated that we came near closing time either, but instead, they were very welcoming and accommodating.   My recommendations: Do yourself a favor and get the bashers and mash and shepherds pie! The crust of the pasties were so PERFECT. Beautifully flacky and not soggy even though inside of the pasty was filled with steaming potatoes and meat.   DON'T skimp out on the desserts either!! Their caramel apple crumble pasty was AMAZING. Just like the pasties for the shepherds pie or the bashers and mash, the apple crumb was encased in the lovely pasty crust. It not overly sweet like many other desserts even though it was drenched with warm caramel on top. I don't typically get desserts but I was just feeling it on this day. This dessert did not let me down was the best way to end the meal.",

Some of my favorites are: The Mexican, Carne Adovada, and Chicken Tikki Marsala.  It's definitely worth a trip! I have gone to all 3 locations, and I have never had a bad experience. The vibe at the one is Mesa and this one in Tempe is more college-y and grungy-like, but the one in Scottsdale is the opposite with lots of great outdoor seating and an outdoor bar.",

I could say I haven't been in the neighborhood as much, or that their lights are a little too dim for my liking, but those are nothing but excuses and as I write this review on an empty stomach, my mouth is watering at the thought of these pasties.  I think I know what we're having for dinner.  The menu and dining area have grown since the last time I had dined here.  It's no longer small and cozy, but a lot roomier but still holds the cozy vibe that I love.  Unfortunately, that involves the dimly lit room, but I always order more or less the same thing anyway and there's always the light from my phone if I needed to read the menu.  The pasties, needless to say, are delicious.  Think of something along the lines of a chicken pot pie, but shaped like a calzone.  And tastes way better.  You'll have to try them for yourself - they do not disappoint.  They do have a variety of beers on tap too, and I would highly recommend pairing one with your pasty!",

It was excellent.  I tried both the house gravy and ketchup (both traditional sauces) on it.  The Cornish style Cole slaw was excellent too.  I returned the next night and tried the Carne Adovada pasty.  A non-traditional pasty, but excellent in its own right.  I spent both nights at The Beast, a dive bar attached to the main dining room.  It was a pleasure to sit at the bat and enjoy the wide range of music - from Johnny Cash to the Butt hole Surfers and everything between.",

Their wide selection, incredibly tender and flavorful options along with an absolutely terrific beer menu makes this place a smash hit. The only problem is all their pies are premade so there are no substitutions or even removals. You just have to eat them as is.",

The staff came pretty quickly to clean off the table and gave us menus.  I ordered the chicken pot pie pasty and a side of roasted potatoes.   The chicken pot pie was very good, but the potatoes were slight under cooked.  The service was pretty good.",

    "text": "It has been a LONG TIME since I have been to this place, but I would love to put my 10 cents in.  First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.  So there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.  Second, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!",

    "text": "This place was a winner.  I don't eat around Tempe too often and when I do I'd like that experience to be unique.  I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.  To me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.  Inside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)  Their draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.  Most importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.  We unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, \"Knowing about good food - FAIL!\"",

I had the lamb vindaloo and I finished the whole thing!! It's 90 degrees out and freezing in here... the vindaloo was so hot (spicy) it totally warmed me up. The mint yogurt balances the heat very well I just wish there is more... the pastry was over cooked and hard (maybe that's why I waited so long?) I would've liked it flaky.

I goes and eats where i please. I just throw a few butterfly sticker-tattoos on various parts of my body and blend right in.  I like places with a character and this place has it in spades.  The cooks/waiters/waitresses are friendly and the pastys are good eats!  I must warn that they are more filling that you would think.   Good beer good food! Ridiculously cheap (knock back a few Rogues for me) The dark lighting also makes your friends look sooo much better.  win win.  and win.",

    "text": "We went to The Cornish Pasty Co. yesterday (Sunday) around 1:00pm and it was packed. Granted, the place is tiny, so it doesn't take many people to fill the restaurant. We waited a few minutes and were able to get two chairs at the bar. If you're sitting at the bar, you're essentially in the open kitchen as well. Like I said, it's very small! We had an awkward few minutes at the bar (sitting in front of people's empty plates), but someone finally gave us menus.   We ordered draft beer - Rogue Hazelnut Brown, which happens to be one of our favorites. I've never seen it on tap before, so we were pretty excited to try it. It did not disappoint! We ordered our pasties; I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the chicken tikka masala. I think we'd agree that they were both good, but nothing mind-blowing.  My husband is from England and thought the sausages didn't taste authentic. They were extremely sage-y and a bit tough. I was a bit disappointed that the \"mash\" was really just chunks of potatoes. The red wine gravy served on the side was good.   I think it was a bit pricey for what we got - two pasties and two beers for $28. I wouldn't make a special trip to Tempe to have it again.",

Once I finally decided that the front door was, in fact, the front door (it's a bit dark and seems like you're entering the back of the kitchen or something) I had a seat at a small table along the wall. Once my eyes adjusted, I fell in love with the place. The atmosphere is great. The menu is amazing. The beer list is generous. I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the pesto chicken pastry. We shared a coleslaw. First off, the coleslaw was the best we have ever eaten. Secondly, I wish I lived in Tempe because I want to go back and try everything else on the menu. It was killer! Totally delicious. Soft flaky crusts, amazing dipping sauces, ice-cold beer and great service. They really have a good thing going here. I want to open one in Austin.",

Ok, so while the Pasties are basically hot pockets, they are really quite a full meal.  I've been more than once, and each time the food and service (people have talked about lax service, which I haven't ever seen) have been amazing.

It does have a pub feel and can get a little loud with how busy it gets, so I wouldn't recommend going here if you're looking for a quiet dinner. The pasties are very nicely priced with how much food you get. Honestly, I usually take half of it home to eat later (if you do take it home, I'd recommend heating it up in the toaster oven). If you need pasty recommendations, I'd recommend the cajun, portobello mushroom, and cheese steak. The desserts are also delicious. So, in conclusion, come into Cornish Pasty and enjoy the world of classy hot pockets.",

That is neither good nor bad, just my observation.  Staff is young and friendly, tho not what I would call professional.  Typical college attitude.  Again, neither good nor bad, just a fact.  Menu is amazing.  I love pasties and couldn't decide which to order.  There are also 4 soups and each one sounded better than the next.  The bread is homemade and to die for, served warm with a soft inside and crispy crust, as it should be.   There are 4 or 5 homemade potato dishes that I will attempt next time as well.  None of the frozen or instant variety here.  Can't wait to try the mushy peas.  Last time I had those were the real deal in London, but I am confident these will compare, if not exceed.  Service is fairly slow, but everything is being made as you order, so good quality, fresh food takes time.  Everything and I mean everything is made from scratch.  Very impressive considering the narrow, tight small kitchen, which is open by the way for all to see.  I have no idea how they work in there, but they do and they do it well.  Prices are great too. $6-$8 a pasty and should be enough for most appetites.   $2.95 a cup of soup with bread and butter.  I will definitely be back until I taste every pasty on the menu.",

It's hot pockets for foodies. Great food, prepared with fresh ingredients. Everything is made from scratch, from the delicate crust to the savory fillings. They have a huge selection of different fillings (about 35), including a big selection of vegetarian selections. One of my favorites is the Veggie Rosemary Chicken (or non veggie version too). The sides (oven roasted potatoes) and salads are great too. They're open late, so I often stop here after a band gig when I'm starving and sit at the long bar. Service is usually very good.",

But the staff are fast and efficient and they take care of you. They explain pasties for the ones who are new to the place. I tried both mock chicken pasties(Asiago mock chicken) and the real chicken (chicken Tikka masala) pasties. Both were good with the real  chicken being much better with the side of yogurt. Pasties as such are like a bigger versions of samosa for Indians. But they are different. And this is a must try place atleast one time just for the uniqueness of the dish. Have not tried the desert pasties yet...!!!",

Anyway, this meal was a delightful taste and cultural experience, in the otherwise megacorporate sprawl wasteland of Arizona (what I saw of it anyway, I'm a Seattleite). Although I entered very reluctantly (it was phenomenally gorgeous out and this place is basically a cave), I was quickly pacified by the familiar surroundings... booze and dingy booths, my native habitat.   I'm a True pasty fancier, and the ones here are top-notch. If I ever mistakenly return to your city, I will gladly hide out at the CPC.",

In addition to the previous area with the long narrow counter there is now a much larger dining room.  There is still a bit of construction going on and when driving by at night the blackout on the windows makes it appear closed which was a bit confusing.  The food takes a bit of time to get at both locations, but it's very much worth it.  They have a pretty expansive and varied menu ( all contained in pastry ) with lots of options for vegetarians.  Our waiter was very nice and checked on us to make sure our beers were full and we got everything we needed.  This is a very unique and awesome restaurant.  Try:  - Egg Plant Parm - Veggie Cottage Pie - Oggie",

Some friends and I wandered in this little hidden gem late on a Thursday night. The expanded back room is lined with old church pews and community style tables. Walls are decorated with large canvas photographs of old miners digging deep, naturally. I order a Strongbow and my brother ordered a fancy beer that came in a mug so big it had a lip to drink out of. Very cool. It feels very much like an Irish pub or a gastropub because it is so tucked away and no where close to a bar scene.  We order The Royal with Cheese pasty, the Rueben pasty, the Mint and Lamb pasty and an Asiago Chicken pasty. To say that everyone was 100% satisfied at the end of their meal would be an understatement. I would HIGHLY reccommend this place to anyone and I will be going back.",

Yup, Cornish Pasty Co!  After promising myself that I would try this place for way too long, I decided to go with a co-worker for my first visit. For my first trip to CPC, I chose the Tikka Masala pasty. It was pretty good! I guess I was hoping for a serving of spicy, somewhat creamy, and savory tikka masala served in a hot pocket. What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.  On my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good! The meat was juicy and a little grease was dripping out of the pocket, which meant that it was nice and juicy!   Whenever I am tempted by a hot pocket, I make sure that I head to CPC for a well made, tasty, more sophisticated version!",

Be warned these pasties are fri kin huge, filling, and you probably won't finish one on its own. The shepherds pie was also delicious, but really it all looks so good. The crust on these pies are flaky, tasty delicious. The fillings are delicious, and they definitely don't skimp on the filling. The sauces that come with the pasty are also delicious too.  Also, they have a royale with cheese. Pulp fiction anyone?",

The place is lit by candles and soft lightings, with metal music playing in the background. Occasional rock and metal music plays in the back ground which goes well with the easy ambience. The place despite its unconventional getup offers intimacy for groups and also welcomes loners. They have a huge collection of beer, both domestic and imported, all reasonably priced. On to the main course - pasties. Comparing pasty with hot-pockets oversimplifies this delicacy. Alright, its roasted bread stuffed with cheese and your choice of meat, but there is so much more to it. Depending on what you get, you'll get to enjoy vibrant flavors that go well with your choice of alcohol (personal recommendation - get Buddingtons). Pasty recommendation: Peppered Lamb",

I had looked online at the website ahead of time at the menu and was impressed with the beer list, as well as the selection of pasties. I was expecting it to be all chicken-pot-pie and shepards pie but it was not the case. It's a very skinny joint with a small amount of seating. I did notice towards the back a booth, which would be great for a big group but parties of 2-4 is probably best. We started off with some beers, which was nice because the pasties take about 20 minutes to cook. Just enough time to quench your thurst and may I just say any place that can make a black velvet (not too many) from there draft is directly put on to my favs. I  appreciate it! I had the Chicken Takki Masala pasty. It was delicious! Perfectly spicy and flavorful, the colors were also fantastic! I did however wish there was more chicken it it, which was cooked and spiced to perfection (the potatoes were as well but the chicken was just wonderful).  Steph had the Greek Chicken pasty which was also delicious. I think next time I'll get one of those for myself. I will definitely be heading back here! Not only was the food good, but they had great tunes on, great service, and good-looking cooks!",

    "text": "I had eaten here a few years ago when they first opened, but didn't remember too much about it other than cheap Irish Car Bombs.  It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.    I'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.    I could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.  As for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank.",

Great beer selection, and they have hard cider on draft which I appreciate with this type of cuisine. I had the chicken pot pie pasty and I will never have another pot pie again, it was that good. My friend had the Mexican Pasty and was in love with it. This place is definitely worth trying at least once, if not a hundred times over.",

    "text": "I need to confirm that the Cornish Pasty Company is a pocket of heavenly yum yum. My husband got himself a peppered steak, I grabbed a salmon asparagus pocket and my daughter snagged a meats and cheese version. Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale.  Right away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier. I was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated. I could bring my veggie friends/family here too. I knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go! Update: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy.",

To boot, they have Strongbow cider on tap, happy hour daily from  3 to 6, and the most unbelievable pasties we've had outside of Truro, Cornwall.  And that's not even mentioning the Shirley Temple pudding.....The food is rib-sticking and makes you feel like you are lying down on a soft couch and blanket when you eat it.  There is a type of pasty for everyone here, so don't read any more.  Just go.  In the entire valley, this is our 2nd favorite place (the first being a local pizza joint, Palermo's.)  The kids working at the place might be a bit young, brash, and stoner-looking, but the owners and recipes are faultless.  We have been here avout 20 times in the last 2 years, and every time the experience is the same.  Go.  Now.",

Some favorites are the Cajun, the Spicy Asiago, the Philly, though the list could go on about as long as their menu. Beers good. Car bombs are great for those crazier nights.

Last weekend was my first time there since the remodeling really like the extra space now and a great looking new bar, they keep the same feel dark feeling which I think is great.

Keep in mind, I dont drink alcohol so I am not eating this stuff just to accompany a Guinness or Strong Bow. I really like it. All of it.

I first went to this restaurant in 2014 and there's no stopping since then. The place is very hipster, dark and packed. It definitely seems like a Sherlock holmes, batman night out.   There are days when I crave for their Mushroom soup. Its one of the best soup i have had. They have creamy, walnut filled mushroom soup, served with house made bread and heaps of butter. You will never get tired of their bread. Cream of tomato with croutons is good too. We generally order Tandoori wings for our appetizer, which is cooked to perfection, not spicy and served with celery and ranch. When it comes to pasty, they are the boss. Their Lamb vidaloo, Chicken tikka masala brings out the complete flavor in a pasty form. The filling is delicious and their pasty, so soft made of complete butter just melts in the mouth, baked till crisp golden from the outside . One can eat just the plain pasty and crave for more. Spicy Asiago chicken and chicken pot pie are our next options. Please save room for desert, each ones unique but Apple caramel pasty you will not be disappointed.  They have a wide range of options and this place is definitely heaven for vegans too. The service is really good and you will find a lot of young hip crowd. The price is definitely reasonable and a great place to hangout with groups. I will keep visiting this place.",

Service was okay, however, our waitress seemingly forgot about us when a group of her friends came in and sat at the table next to us.  On this occasion, My bf and I shared the meatball, while I got the chicken tikka masala and he got the carne adovara (spelling?).  I had a bite of the carne and it tasted good but wouldn't have been my pick.  It tasted kinda like a flaky, crunchy burrito.  We also got the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.

You then choose from their several selections of fillings and after not too long this wonderful breaded masterpiece arrives at your table. Pair the breaded deliciousness with a pretty good beer selection and a pseudo hipster vibe to get yourself a real unique winner for lunch/dinner.

We ordered the phoughman's plate to share and added the sausage salad (which we could have done with out... so much food for two).  I highly recommend the \"Scotch Egg\" that is wrapped with homemade sage sausage and rolled in bread crumbs and then baked..... I know.... sounds odd and weird, but it is delicious!!! Then the blue cheese, we were told is imported from england...so creamy and flavorful!!  The sausage salad was crazy good, homemade pork and sage sausage cooked in a flat cookie like sheet and then cut to look like croutons ....huge salad and we split it!!!

The joy of eating such delicious and American adapted English cuisine makes me very emotional. Satisfying me mentally, physically and culturally.  In a world where people actually rate gross, breaded, stale fish patty's from Pete's fish & chips as legit British food I had given up on life. How could such basic and easy British cuisine be so poorly executed? Maybe it's the desert heat? Even Brit owned restaurants here are poor... until now.  There is no wonder they are spreading across the valley so quick. The parts here are incredible and they have approx 1 billion options. There is only one style of Cornish pasty in England but the owner has adapted a bunch different styles and flavours in order to keep hold the average Americans attention (this can be difficult).  Overall a great experience, even though this place feels a bit like a dungeon I'm really ok with this as the teriyaki pasty gives me life.",

    "text": "I hoped for more from Cornish Pasty Co.  I ordered the Rosemary Chicken (pictured) and while the chicken was pleasantly moist, there was absolutely NO hint of rosemary.  The peppers were fine, but the entire pasty was overpowered by the taste of vinegar the peppers were soaked in.  :(  I also ordered a half-baked Oggie (pictured) to go for a friend and am told it largely tasted like a pot pie.  I guess that's fine if that's what you're looking for, but the only flavor stand out seemed to be the wine-flavored gravy.  The dining room near the entrance was rather small, but it seems they're expanding into the space next door to create a second, larger dining room and second bar (pictured.)  It's unclear if they intend to continue remodeling or if it's complete, but it currently has a combination of very dated details as well as newer, more modern ones.  The second dining room is filled with old church pews for seating which I have mixed feelings about.  I'm happy to see they've been re-purposed, but can't help but wonder how many funerals they've \"seen.\"  It's slightly creepy while trying to eat.  The server was nice enough, but I have a pet peeve about restaurant cleanliness.  It was rather slow and the server amused himself between visits to the table by playing darts with another patron.  I could care less how he spends his down time, but would have appreciated seeing him wash his hands after touching the same darts other people have used.  Who knows where THEIR hands have been???  If I ever pay CPC another visit, I think I'll skip the entree and try dessert, instead.  Or better yet, skip the dessert and plunk down $3 for a Happy Hour Car Bomb and hope they offer free WiFi by then.  Hopefully, the bartender's hands will be clean.",

He was pleasantly surprised to find they were comparable to the pasties back home. My daughter and I also enjoyed our meal. We ordered the shepherds pie pasty, Oggie pasty, sausage, scotch eggs, and sticky toffee pudding. Everything was tasty .    We recently tried their new location in Flagstaff and it was exceptional!  Give this establishment a try, you won't be disappointed.",

College students are perfectly fine eating crap and having a place the served booze. This place was awful to say the least. I ordered a stew pasty and got a large \"empanada\" filled with meat and cheese. NEVER had a stew with cheese. Ordered the scotch egg as an appetizer and when one of the guys different from our server brought the Pasty's, I inquired about the scotch egg and the guy was like \"I don't know\" and walked off. When the waiter taking care of us made it to the table I asked about the scotch egg and his answer was \"oh sorry forget to mention they are out\" I think Yelp needs to have a zero rating available for Yelp followers to leave a genuine review. Thank god this place is in AZ. It would be out of business in Chicago.",

    "text": "Whenever a group of us is planning on getting together for dinner in the Tempe area, it's only a matter of time before Cornish Pasty comes up. It's kind of shocking that we have been there so many times and can honestly say that we have never gotten anything that has left us disappointed!  A few of my go-to pasty choices are the Chicken Pot Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Portobello Chicken. All though the fillings are great, my favorite part of the pasty is the soft, doughy, yet flaky outside. They seem to bake each one to the perfect golden brown! One pasty is pretty large, so depending on how hungry I am, I sometimes finish the whole thing but most times have some leftover.  They have a pretty extensive menu and the choices are so unique there's literally something for everyone. If you're vegetarian then you'll definitely be in luck because they have a whole list of vegetarian and vegan options too!  Unfortunately, the only dessert I've tried at Cornish Pasty has been the Shirley Temple's Pudding. It was so delicious (with both the creme anglaise and ice-cream) that I can only imagine how the rest of the desserts are! I definitely recommend saving room to get something.  Overall, the service is also good but it's a popular spot so they get pretty busy. The patio is large, great for groups to enjoy the Arizona weather during the cooler months, and also it's dog friendly! We'll definitely keep coming back.",

I've been to Cornwall 3 times and I wasn't that keen on all the Cornish pasties I have tried. I was like, I much rather have empanadas than pasties because they generally taste better. Although I was a bit skeptical at first, all the pasties I've tried here were all delicious and each of them had a great flavor! If you like artichokes, then you must try pesto chicken pasty! So good! And I highly recommend chicken tikka salad, cheap, healthy and delish!! The ambiance is cool and trendy, and I love the music that they play... Lots of good 80's British indie rock!! If you want to try pasties, don't go to Cornwall.... Just come here and you'll love it!",

The cook with the purple bandana was loudly singing for our entire experience. It was like watching tv with a bad jazz station on just as loud in the back round. Please stop him.   The food: I would give this place zero stars based on food alone. It took almost 20 minutes and the pasty tasted like someone tried to smoke me out of my house with a Rosemary bush. And the coleslaw description should read \"cabbage mixed with mayo, shredded and scooped with the cup it's served in\" It was inedible and when we told the bartender she did take actually it off the check which was good. The fries were good, but not good enough to come back for.   On top of everything else, I feel like they keep the lights low for a reason. Everything did have a certain dinge to it.  Won't be back.",

I sat down at the bar waiting for my call in order, and decided to order a beer. Got my beer, and then bartender proceeded to tell me that I should check out this \"dive bar\" and was saying people like me would like a place like that...? (The way he said it was as if he intended to offend me but I didn't get the reference because I have never been there).Then we got our food and he walks over and says \"you want some shots before you head over there (the bar he referenced), you know we're a bar we got plenty of whisky shots for you\".. Dude had a red beard over a foot and a half long with no tie, no nothing.  I've just been in this industry for over 8 years now and honestly haven't seen someone do something so offensive to a customer in all my time. The whole time the dude had his friends sitting at the bar next to us.. Thanks for putting us down just for a laugh!",

My husband and I usually share one cornish pasty and a side and I'm stuffed. They really have delicious flavors and they are super affordable.  They can get pretty crowded but I haven't ever had a problem eating at the bar. My only complaint is that the stools/counter are clearly meant for average/tall people and I'm so short it isn't very comfortable. Other than that, A+!",

Little did I know what a cool scene I was walking into or I would have probably changed out of my pajamas. In reality, NO ONE CARED about my attire, the lighting was dark and the seating was said to be from an old mine however it reminded me more of a church.  The people that work here are super chill, they were playing AC/DC's, \"Let there be Rock\" and the pasty's reminded me of an Australian pie.   The soup was fabulous and they give you tons of bread which is delicious to dip or butter! They've got pasties on pasties on pasties to pick from as well. I decided on the vegan eggplant parmesan and although I was under the impression I specifically asked for no cheese, vegan or not, I received it. Hey, mistakes happen it was what it was and I wouldn't order that again but even if I wasn't going to eat, its a low key hipster bar scene for sure, and i'm all about that.",

I have not had another vegan pasty, decided that they do the others so good that I will indulge in the heavier tastier options instead! I pretty much always get the Lamb and Mint one but the last two times I got the Original which is similar to the lamb and mint (same sauce option) and less expensive (I can be kinda... thrifty I'll call it) We have have their cocktails a few times with no disappointment and they always have the Union Jack IPA which is one of my favorites! We always leave soo full and need a nap usually right when we get home but we always feel so satisfied. It's turned into the spot my friends and I go to together and we have even done the take-home ones at some small get-togethers we've had! This and Welcome Diner have been my all time favorite spots here in Phoenix and everyone needs to experience it! Been wanting to take my parents here forever, was hoping to get to enjoy the DTPHX one but may just have to bite the bullet and take that long 12 minute drive to Tempe! Thanks for always being consistently awesome!",

The crust is pheonomenal. The filling is tasty. I will definitely return. The pasties are a hearty size and enough to totally satisfy. We ordered the Banofee for dessert at the recommendation of fellow Yelper's. We each took a bite and had to pack it up to go. We had no room for it but it was ooey, gooey, whip cream, banana, caramel deliciousness. Our server was attentive and checked in with us often. I shall return in the very near future.

If you don't know what that is then think about as...[moan]...a Hot Pocket.  As far as the pasties go, the Lamb Vindaloo is my favorite. I've also tried The Chicken Greek (least favorite), Chicken Tikka Masala, Lovely Bit a Salmon, and the Peppered Steak. They also have a good selection of vegetarian pasties even though I have yet to try them.  This place has expanded and added a lot more space on the other side, but, in my opinion, lost a bit of charm. Something about being uncomfortably hot near the ovens on a summer day in a somewhat cramped setting equals pure character, and I do miss it. Unless I'm hungry.  The staff is laid-back and pretty cool reminding me of dives in Austin, Charlotte, and Philly.  If you want, you can get the pasties half-baked so you can take them home and pop them in a 425-degree oven for 15-20 minutes. But why deprive yourself the experience of enjoying it here?",

    "text": "The first time I tried Cornish Pasty was about two years ago, and it rocked. I just went again last week with the boyfriend, and it impressed me so much again the second time again I felt compelled to yelp about it!  We arrived there at around 6pm on a Friday night. Luckily, we grabbed the last table of two without having to wait at all! As many previous reviewers have mentioned, this place is not good for large parties. There are four 2-seater tables along the right side of their narrow dining room, a full service bar along the left side, and a couple slightly larger tables that seat 4 along the back, and that's it.   The atmosphere is offbeat and funky. It's pretty dark in there, so it feels like a cave, but in a good way. Like you stumbled into the lair of a friendly Giant who happens to bake the best damn pasties you've ever had on the reg, and wants to share.   Service was quick and friendly. We started off with a large house salad to split with their house lemon pesto vinaigrette dressing. Yum!  It was more than enough for two people to share for a first course - we could barely even finish it.   I ordered the Shepherd's Pie pasty with the minted lamb, and OMG. This thing was fantastic. It took my experience to the next level. Oozing cheese, garlicky mashed potatoes, crispy buttery pastry crust, and this amazing seasoned lamb. I had the Pilgrim pasty the first time I ate here a few years ago, and it was very good, but this Shepherd's pie pasty blew it out of the water. Not to mention the red wine gravy served with it. NOM NOM NOM.   I was so stuffed after eating half our salad and half of my huge pasty that I absolutely HAD to say no to dessert (note: this is very unlike me :)). The next time I go (and there WILL be a next time, and soon) I plan to try either the banoffee pie or the cinnamon apple pasty!  Bottom line: This place is excellent. Reasonable prices for very generous portions, there are plenty of options and definitely something for everyone. If you have yet to try it, check it out the next time you are in the Tempe area!   Bonus: you'll probably even have leftovers to take home and enjoy later!",

The Porky consists of pork, potatoes, apples, onion, and sage, with a side of red wine gravy.  The Bangers and Mash pasty consists of pork and sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, and comes with a side of gravy.   The Chicken Pot Pie Pasty has chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery, with a thyme and chicken gravy.  They also have one of the best and most unique beer menus available with an awesome mix of domestic micro brews and great European options.

Not sure why people are saying it's in a sketchy neighborhood -- I think the worst thing that will happen to you is you might get asked for spare change in the parking lot, but trust me, you are perfectly safe coming here. Can't speak to the \"authenticity\" of these pasties, but they sure are good, and I love that there's such a variety of flavors/textures to try.  I'm sad I discovered this place right before I moved out of state.",

Until a few weeks before i went to the Cornish pasty i didnt even know what a pasty was....until my Michigan roommates told me. So i gave it a try, what hooked me was the spicy chicken asiago pasty, its out of this world....i think their crust is their main key ingridient, its tasty, light and flaky. My second time there i tried the chicken masala and it was great for my spicy taste but it may be too spicy for most people. I also had the cajun pasty and it was equally great, the ham inside have it an unexpected pleasant flavor. If you havent been there, you are not making yourself any favors, this hole in the wall is every bit as good as its 5-star rating and prob more!",

Fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly, though I have trouble bringing myself to get anything but The Pilgrim (served with turkey, cubed sweet potatoes, onions, and deliciousness). Cornish Pasty is great, though you'll likely want to consider takeout: it's TINY and finding a table can be a real pain.  The staff is fun and helpful, even though they're quite harried, and the oven-roasted potatoes are fantastic, as are nearly all of the pasty options, all priced damn well, to boot. If you've never been, they'll almost certainly have something you like. My only problem is that nothing is customizable: they're all served as is, which I understand from a production standpoint, but which frustrates for the number of menu items with just one dealbreaking ingredient for me.  Overall, it's exceedingly easy to be a regular, and to feel VERY full, careful not to eat the crimped part of the pasty, just like the tin miners of yore so as to avoid the traces of arsenic from their dirty hands.",

Their british pub concept could be so cool, but instead it was really dark (blackout curtains on every window), way too loud (blaring music), and just overall way too hipster grunge for me (hello, Seattle). Dining experience aside, the menu is giant and the food is really good. I had: -  Greek Pasty: Vegetarian and I absolutely loved all the flavors in it. It was full of cheese, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives all wrapped up in a warm buttery crust.  - House Salad: Really fresh (amazing tomatoes) and good-sized.  - Sticky Toffee Pudding: Having read about the dessert in English books, I've always wanted to try it. It was pretty good but probably not something I'd order again. After this dish and watching enough Downtown Abbey, I finally get that the English call their cakes \"pudding\". So it's not pudding at all, but a cake. There really wasn't enough of a toffee flavor, and instead most of the cake had a mild molasses flavor. Parts of the cake were really dry, so the vanilla ice cream its served with made it a lot better. This is certainly a fun dessert to try, but not totally my favorite.  I only ate half of my pasty at dinner, then ate the other half a few hours later in the comfort of my own home, and definitely enjoyed the leftover half in my home a whole lot more. So overall, I really recommend the food, just in a to-go form :)",

They carried out both orders very well and without the confusion many places seem to have when they receive such an order.  Good place for an occasional visit but regular visits might incur a larger waistline as it is a very carb heavy meal.

I ordered my Manger's Cider at the bar overlooking the kitchen and chatted with the kitchen staff: friendly young guys who were enjoying life. I am a fan of enjoying life while you are working, and I am always sure to have a good meal when the staff is doing so. Got a chicken pot pie pasty, chips with malt vinegar. Good stick to your ribs lunch fare. Red wine gravy was two thumbs up caliber.  Expensive, came to 21 bucks with tip, more than my usual lunch budget allows, but ok for a splurge.

    "text": "Love it, love it, love it!!!! Just.... not the space. SO small and always packed results in either a long wait or us leaving to find a different place to eat. However, the food and service is always excellent. If you've never had a pasty before, you need to go and try one. They are very filling and every different kind I've tried, has been excellent. If you don't know what it is, think of it as like a larger, tastier & fresher hot pocket. I normally stick with \"The Oggie\", \"Bangers & Mash\" or \"Cottage Pie\". All 3 are excellent. I also request an extra side of their red wine gravy. Its amazing!  Don't be scared off when you walk in to find dark walls, dim light and rock music playing. Nor the servers & chef's with tattoos and piercings... because you could easily miss out on one hell of a meal.  (I'd like to add that if you want to avoid the small, dark space with limited seating, you can always try out their other location off Dobson & Guadalupe).",

I couldn't pick a favorite because both were delicious. I also ordered a side of the broccoli and cauliflower bake since the entrees were not served with a side. It was good, but not really meant for take out, so I can't hold that against them. They did their best to package it up. All food was served hot out of the oven and was prepared quickly. So yummy! Beats late night fast food any day! I can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "What a great find. I was with my friend over the Christmas holiday and we decided to check this place out. Upon entering this BAR/restaurant I was immediately turned off by the blasting of music so loud my heart was pounding. After ordering and waiting on our drinks I had decided to just leave because of the music but was presently surprised that after asking the waitresses to turn the music down, she did with a smile. I guess they prefer a total BAR atmosphere ! After surveying the menu for 15 minutes I decided on the Philly Cheese Steak Pastie and my friend went traditional with the Shepherds Pie. Let me say we were NOT disappointed, the Pasties were fresh and yummy delicious, mine came with a mustard cream sauce as well as their red wine gravy that I had asked for. I prefer the gravy ! My friends Shepherds Pie with Lamb and the wine gravy was also yummy. After a short walk around I was surprised to see all of these wonderful pie's were being made FRESH behind a short order/bar environment. Yes just like we used to see in the drug stores, a griddle and gas fired 4 burner stove and a tiny convection oven If you've never had a pastie, its basically like a calzone but uses a pastry crust. There were over 25 different variations with several great looking desserts, we decided on the homemade bread pudding, more chocolate brownie tasting then traditional bread pudding, but tasty all the same. There prices were fair for the Tempe area, $9.50 and $9.75 respectively and the bread pudding was $7.50. I am looking forward to dining there again when they are not out of their homemade sausage. If you don't care for a Bar atmosphere, loud music, dark and dingy then you should steer clear or set outside. I should add that I found it extremely odd that they used old church pews for a large part of their seating.",

The dimly lit room was filled with booths and it was dark enought that all of our 50+ year old eyes needed a candle or flashlight to read the menu. One guy even tripped over a hidden step that was sticking out from a sofa. Yes we laughed and made fun of him. The place has a bit of a dive bar feel. Just what I like. The music selection was excellent, deep cuts both modern and old. Loud enough to listen too but still hold a conversation. In this back room it was bar service only meaning we had no waitstaff. The people behind the bar were talkative, friendly, entertaining and very efficient. The menu is filled with a number of exotic pasty fillings, unlike the ground burger ketchup and potato mixture mom used to make. Nope, this is the real deal and ranges from chicken pot pie to salmon. The food was excellent, the beers were big, local and cold.  My only complaint is that the back room temperature was hotter than hell. Overall a very good experience.",

    "text": "I had no idea what a \"pasty\" was before coming here, and I was actually a little wary of trying something that sounded like nipple coverings.  Thankfully, Cornish Pasty is lacking tassels and the like, simply serving up deliciously magical pockets filled with wonderful themed concoctions.    My personal favorite is the reuben, where the pastrami and corned beef is tender, juicy and chewy at the same time, the buttery crust is perfectly flaky, and the 1000 Island dressing is something I enjoy smothering everything in.  I don't know that I've had a reuben in the valley that's comparable to how amazing this pasty is.  And the oven chips?  Forget about it!  Not that you need a side with the size of the pasties...Oh, the Apple Caramel Pasty is also pretty top notch for dessert - warm and gooey.  Their craft beer selection is also admirable, with a few local drafts (including Four Peaks and Oak Creek) and plenty of English-themed brews and English IPAs.  Full disclosure: as a beer geek, I only wish they didn't serve the beer in a frosted glass...it kinda affects the flavor.  Besides that, there is nothing I can complain about, especially since they recently expanded into the building next door, thus gaining about 5X the seating and space.  Much more comfortable, less claustrophobic, and easier to get around.",

DD got a peanut butter and jelly pasty, which had bananas inside.  She was smitten.  SD got the Oggie and DH got the Cottage Pie.  Both loved their choices, which came with Red Wine Gravy for dipping sauce.  DM got the Carne Adovada and said she liked it but the pork was a little tough.  4 stars for the location.   The parking was a nightmare (it took DM and SD 15 minutes to find a space) and the restaurant really has an ASU clientele.  The place was dark, cold (we were near the exterior door which they left open because the kitchen was so hot) and small.  I do not think this is a good place to bring kids, at all.  I will definitely come back for a visit... though next time it will be sans 4 year old!",

We arrived about 5 mins early and they informed us that there wasn't room on the patio or the dining area. We were told to pick out a spot in the bar area (with 4 children). No one helped us put chairs or tables together and we still had to cram into a spot that didn't fit us. That was a frustrating experience. We were a family coming to enjoy a birthday dinner together, the music was so loud and we couldn't hold conversation.  Casey was our bartender/server and she was awesome. She was on top of drink refills and was very patient/pleasant, I know that large parties are not always the easiest.  As for the food, it was delicious as always which is why I am still providing a 4 star rating.  I will definitely come back but without children and the rest of the family.",

I had the Oggie (cause I couldn't decide). It was very good! Only ate half cause I ordered the mushroom soup with walnuts etc. you get two pieces of fluffy bread and butter with. Omg took half of pasty home.. brrrrp! BF had Lamb n mint. He thought it was bland. Oh well hard to please everybody. He DID enjoy the Greek salad tho so it wasn't a total loss.  My Bro had the peppers one and he was quite excited how good it tasted. He ate half and was debating to take it home and ruin the re-heating or just eat it... he ate it!!! Being full of course we all shared one chocolate bread n butter pudding with ice cream. So now we are all happy and overfull but satisfied to an extreme ! It was so delicate but had that crunch on the outside like fresh out of the oven. And the creamy vanilla ice cream was a perfect wash for it all. Ok now I'm done..",

They also have a nice beer selection featuring many local brews. Started off with fresh chips and added melted cheese. They were fresh cut fries and really worth the calories!!   We ordered the cheese and onion and the Greek chicken pasty. The crust was so delicious, amaze balls really! The cheese and onion pasty was filled with potato, turnip, onion and cheese. Very tasty and satisfying (a tad salty though). Washed it down with Koffee Kolsch ale from Huss brewing company (local to Tempe AZ). This was a spectacular golden beer with a coffee and vanilla finish.   This is a great casual place with a unique food offering that I haven't seen stateside in all my travels. Small indoor bar with about 5 tables plus additional outdoor bar and seating.",

    "text": "Came here on a recommendation from a friend after a volunteer project and I was not impressed. First off, the entrance to the restaurant is not on University Dr but rather on S. Hardy Dr.   Upon entering, my eyes had to adjust to the extremely dark lighting and interior. There are several entrances to the place so you might have to walk around a bit to get to the main dining area. We walked through the bar area (which smelled like a college pub) to arrive at the main dining area which was fairly empty. There was only one other table occupied besides ours and a couple patrons at the bar. After, we were at a loss of what to do as no one directed us towards a table or told us to seat ourselves. Finally, we asked the chef and he said you can grab any table you want. My friend went up to get menus herself and we perused for several minutes before our waitress arrived. She was helpful in taking our order but she certainly took her time in attending to us and serving our food. Which was confusing to me as there was only one other table she had to attend to.   When I asked her what the red wine gravy was made of, she was confused by my question and did not answer correctly. She did state that the alcohol evaporates however I could clearly taste it when I ate it with my pasty.   This place's only saving grace was its food. I ordered the Oggie pasty which was wonderful except the meat tasted slightly undercooked. My friends all loved their pasties and the flavors came together beautifully.   They did split the check between four credit cards.  Overall, I would not come back, nor would I recommend this place to others. At post, take your food togo because the atmosphere of the restaurant definitely downgrades the experience.",

I specifically love going to this location and sitting on the bar side of the building, I find it very unique. The food is consistently amazing, trust me I've had it so many times. I always order several drinks too and they have all been made well. For food I switch between the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Greek, and my current favorite Shepard's Pie. The garlic chips are a great side for the pasties. The best part is that I can never finish the whole thing, so I eat half there and take the other half home. The pasties reheat in the oven SO WELL the next day it's just as delicious! I have nothing but good things to say and I highly recommend visiting because you will be a fan for life!",

When you first get in, you'll notice the lack of lighting. The inside looks dark and dingy. My coworker had to use the flashlight on his phone so he can read the menu. They have ample sitting inside and their benches remind me of church pews. The ambience and the decor is very interesting.   They have a very extensive selection of pastys. They also have soups and salads on the menu. I ordered the chicken portobello pasty and I was very happy with it. The portion size is huge and I had enough leftovers for dinner. The crust was flaky and buttery. The marinara sauce that came with my dish tasted fresh with a hint of sweetness from the tomatoes. I also  had a taste of the lamb vindaloo pasty. It's too spicy for my taste and the lamb and it tasted a bit gamy. Overall, the food was great! Will be back to try more.",

They really need to do something about that because of a few months earlier we drove up and decided it was closed so we drove away. This time I tested the doors because reviews are still being written. I am glad I did.  The place is weird though and dark inside.  We decided to eat outside and enjoy the nice weather. Unfortunately for us, the cooks go out to smoke within the distance of the seating area, and we actually had people smoking across from us. I assume no one follows the no-smoking law? Onto the food....that was our biggest surprise! It was wonderful. I tried the shepherd pie one with ground beef and loved it. And the chocolate bread and butter pudding for dessert were fabulous.  Now that I know it's open I would visit more! But please take note of fixing this place up to correct some issues both inside and outside.",

    "text": "A modern take on a British staple, Cornish Pasty Company has about 50 different pasties to choose from including at least 10 vegetarian pasties and even some dessert pasties too!   The restaurant has a Brit pub feel to it, with a bar bar on one side and a dining area and counter seating on the other.   Cornish Pasties were a working class food for miners. They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large.   Mushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.  Lamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended.   Peppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sauteed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it.   If I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous.   The only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it.   Unexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to.   Now if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

Since the restaurant upgrade (from just a tiny hallway) there is much more space available and the patio is quite brilliant for groups! The atmosphere is moody so when British New/Dark Wave from the 80s plays it feels rather fitting. Service here can be a tad rubbish at times. My last visit I was a bit gutted because it seemed like they were out of a lot of items. Oh, bollocks! I suppose that's what I get for waiting until midnight to grab nosh and a pint.

    "text": "I read the reviews and cruised through that beautiful menu several times, \"eye-buying\" about $60 worth of food for ONE person.  I made the 26 mile, 40 minutes drive from N. Phoenix to Tempe.  My GPS took me first to an Arco station for much-needed gas. But the pump was unable to process a credit card asking for a debit card instead. It tried to charge me 35 cents for the privilege of paying Arco for $75 gas. Negatory! So I went down the street to a Circle K, gassed up and told Siri to take me to the Cornish Pasty Co. I ended up in a strip mall right next to that horrid Arco station.  In front of a hole-in-the-wall looking place with vagrants hanging around. Not a great beginning.  But I decided to carry on. After all, I'd come a long way. So I opened the door into a very dark room with a bar on the left. The place was devoid of customers. Or waiters. I stood in the dark for a while watching 2 line cooks dancing, singing and preparing dishes. Finally I asked them if I could get a to-go order. I sure wasn't about to eat in this gothic atmosphere. I was directed to the back of the room where I collided with a waitress carrying empty dishes who almost ran into a busboy with trays of glasses. It's dark. It's foreboding. It's uninviting. The waitress acted like she hadn't seen me. No \"Please be seated. I'll be right with you.\" Nothing. So I continue into another dark room with empty tables and a bar on the right with a grill and two more line cooks. No one greets me or . So I slide slowly down the long length of the dimly lit room, with my eyes on the exit. Again no one said a thing. I had encountered 6 employees but not one offered me a table or acknowledged my presence. I finally just left.  Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location as I've heard from my son that the FOOD is excellent.",

Tasted just like the real dish at an Indian restaurant, just popped inside a warm pastrie. My husband said his was a little dry, but the flavor was dead on. Our only complaint was the service was a bit slow. It took over 40mins for our meat pies to arrive at the table. We were trying to get something quick on our way back to Tucson, and this stop certainly wasn't quick. But that was our only complaint, our server was nice, food was great (and filling), and I love the vibe of this place. We will probably return again on a night when we have a bit more time to really enjoy it.",

I have eaten every Pasty on the menu, and I honestly don't think i have been disappointed once (maybe a thing or two forgotten when we do take out but they always make up for it)   It is a super original spot to take your family if you are in town. There is a nice dining room with a bar and an outdoor patio on the north side, and then on the south end there is a whole other local bar spot called \"The Beast\". A lot of people don't even know it's there. Its a super hip dark lit bar with comfy couches and a stage area that has some old church pews as tables setup. There is a couple pool tables and dart boards. They have live music sometimes and serve the whole Cornish menu. Its pretty much just another part of the same restaurant, but for us locals. A part of the kitchen is behind the bar and you can see how much preparation and fresh ingredients go into these pasties.   Check out their spot on Mill Ave. also for a shot and a late night snack. They usually have the whole menu available as well. Love this restaurant like I love New York pizza. And thats a lot!!",

The place was described as divey but I'd say that none of the negative connotations of that term apply, and only the positive ones. We sat at the bar and enjoyed scotch egg, wings, and two pasties. The chicken parm and the chicken tikka masala were so good I ate until I was in pain..   This place makes the must-go list for whenever I return to AZ.",

The restaurant is small and narrow, but packs in a good crowd.  If it wasn't lunch and I didn't have a long way to drive, I would have tried a beer, since they are a pub too. The waitress did a good job keeping my tall glass of tea filled. The food doesn't come out quickly, but thats fine since the pasty was delicious. My friend who I met there for lunch mentioned how it would be nice if they had a sampler platter of select pasties to try, as there is a plethora of choices on the menu, including a list of vegetarian pasties. If I am in Tempe in the near future, I'll make sure to remember this place. Not easy to find at first, but a darn good discovery to make.",

The staff is extremely friendly and the food is incomparable!  I got the Pesto Chicken and it was so scrumptious!  The pocket was the right temperature and tenderness, and the filling was juicy.  My husband tried the Salmon with all the rave reviews on yelp, and it was so tasty!  The salad was fresh-loved the olives and cherry tomatoes.

    "text": "At the center of this operation is a fabulous crust. I had envisoned sort of a gigantic, doughy calzone filled with equal parts air and filling, but it's much better than that. The crust is a thin shell, like a pie crust, which gives the sandwich a firm, easy to handle structure while maximizing the filling cavity.   The chicken tikka masala was aromatic, beautifully seasoned and downright glorious. Just a wonderful sandwich, even without the complementary and complimentary yoghurt. Shepards pie and a traditional \"Oggie\" received raves as well.   Service was friendly and professional. My only quibble is that certain aspects of the decor scream Tempe dive bar more than outstanding niche restaurant - even at lunchtime. It's rather dark and small, the ceiling's painted black with what looks like auto body paint, furniture is beaten up, the back door glass is cracked and there's tacky boxes of supplies blocking what is already a narrow floor aisle.   Do I think they should invest in brass and wood paneling and pretend to be Houstons? No. I just think their food concept and execution is so unique and terrific that deferred maintenance and sloppiness around the edges kinda detracts from their hard earned, fundamental excellence.   It doesnt detract a lot. CPC honors and indeed transcends \"British Cuisine\" and is definitely worth a visit. The food is marvelous.  Service is good. Everyone seems to be having a good time.  But if you're older or fussy, like me, just dont expect Buckingham Palace.",

Atmosphere is truly unique; the staff mostly plays the music that they want to hear, which can be a bit random but usually interesting.  The building is very narrow and often crowded, which somehow adds to the sense of fun rather than being annoying.  Just one thing: if you absolutely cannot stand hipsters you might want to stay away: the skinny jeans/fixed gear crowd is pretty well-represented.

It's tucked away in an average strip mall and hidden behind an AM/PM. Inside it feels like some Brits renovated an abandoned submarine, it is a tight squeeze in this place but nice a cozy, the lighting is just right and the rustic wood tables and the decor of old mining photos really give this place a distinct mellow feel. The pasty I had the first time was the Bangers and Mash, homemade sausage, some veggies including mash potatoes all inside a delicous pastry or pasty as it is apparently called across the pond. It came with an amazing red wine gravy that just put an already amazing concoction over the top. This place is cheap too! Less than 8 bucks for most the pasties and it is plenty to fill you up. They have alot of British beers on tap too. Overall I would give this place a \"If all British food was like this we would still be under colonial rule!\"",

I was introduced to pasties on my trip to Michigan last November and had them a few times there and I will tell  you the one I had here was way better than any I had there!  Perfect crust, perfect mixture inside--I just wish I lived near, or that they would open a branch in San Diego area!  I got the lamb and mint pastie and it had a mild but distinct lamb flavor (sometimes I order lamb dishes that just taste like beef so I appreciated this) mixed with the veggies and mint.  Very Delicious.  I would have loved to try a dessert but I was too full and had no frig in my motel to take leftovers back to. The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly, too.  I will definitely add this to my list of must-go places for the next visit!",

Enjoyed it much more the other times when sitting at the bar, so definitely suggest doing that if it's available. Also, disappointed in the music choices - it was like swing jukebox music and did not fit the restaurant at all. While the food is super delicious, for the price (~$8.50) the pasties should come with a side of mash or something.  Definitely do not pass up on dessert either.",

I had the chicken tikka masala, which I expected to have more curry sauce but it was dry. The yogurt sauce complemented the pasty since it gave a cool taste to the dish. This pasty is worth a try if you are looking for something interesting.  My fiancee had the Oogie, which tasted dry and had scarce amount of steak chunks. If anything there were more potato chunks than steak chunks. The sauce that came with the Oogie did not taste good and made me want to throw up because it was a wine gravy sauce that tasted like expired sauce. I definitely do not recommend the Oogie.  Warning: The pasty takes about 15 minutes to order, so do not come here hungry and expect to get your pasty right away.   Overall, I do want to come back and give this place another try if I am ever in town.",

I am an Englishman who has eaten a huge number of these delicious pastries, I think the key was the pastry, in England they tend to have too much and not enough filling, this was not the case at the Cornish Pasty Company. Can't wait to eat the second one tonight. I can only review the food, but I will be visiting this location very soon. We need a location in the West Valley!!",

The food was outstanding, got the Parliament Wings to start - they rock. I love when wings are crispy, and these were perfect.   My husband and I got the lamb vindaloo, our aussie got the cottage pie, and my other friend got the Reuben. We all shared pieces with one another and were not disappointed by the flavors.   My aussie friend was in his glory with the Pavlova dessert. He said it isn't 100% pure Australia but if you can get something 99% there, it's super worth it. Waitress brought over 4 spoons for us all to share and my friend had us all tuck in. It was pretty splendid.  Waitstaff was attentive, friendly, and super.   I have two minor criticisms: First, it's freaking dark in there. I have never been into a darker cave in my life to eat food. Second, only one local craft brew on tap was disappointing. I love sampling the local beers when I travel, so I would have loved a choice of three or four.   I'd totally come back here, even just for takeout. ASU students - I hope you know how good you got it.   Cheers, mate.",

Don't let the appearance stop you from eating here though, the food is quite good.  If you don't know, a pasty is a bit like a cross between a pot-pie and calzone.  They have amazing combinations of meats, veggies, and spices so that everyone will enjoy something (if like pot-pie type foods in the first place).  One time, we called ahead and ordered food while driving to the restaurant.  When we got there, we were seated and food was on the table in under 2 minutes.  It was amazing.",

Also, note that it's pretty dark inside, so if you're with people who like a lot of light to read the menu this is not the place.

I love this place and have yet to visit the new location in Mesa, which is now more convenient for me. This location will always be a classic. The staff is \"ALWAYS\" cool. It's kind of a weird set up. The suite is a very narrow rectangle that spans from end-to-end of the building so the space is limited but they made the best of it. You can tell the crew is a unique one and you can see they all understand each other and their duties as they would have to, being that they are constantly on top and all over each other (NOT LIKE THAT! GET YOUR MIND OUTTA THE GUTTER!). It's actually quite entertaining though! They also have great music playing most of the time and serve beer! You really have to go and check it out for yourself; there's no place like it. My goal is to one day try all the different pasty's.   ***Da Bafroom: Mr. Pasty, may I call you Cornish? You got lucky this time! Of all the times I've been to this Establishment, I've not ONCE EVER been to the restroom.

The food is more than filling, the price is very reasonable for what you get, and the staff is friendlier than most places I've been. They serve good beer, and serve $3 car bombs all the time - if you don't like the food, it's easy to drink until you do. It's not very spacious, but that adds to the charm - you may spend up to 15 minutes waiting for a 2-top, but I've never really minded the wait. The soundtrack is better than any you're going to find - I recently ate my Bangers and Mash while listening to Clarence Carter - Strokin'. This quickly devolved into a singalong for several of us, something I would be surprised to find out happens quite often here. I've heard some people say that their pasties aren's as good as other places, but I doubt that these others have the variety and consistent quality that the Cornish has. The salads served here are of exceptional quality as well.  The only problem I've come across here is that the pasties are pre-made, meaning that special requests (no mushrooms, extra meat, etc) cannot be honored. Usually this does not present a problem, but it is something to be aware of.",

    "text": "I've been eating at the Cornish Pasty Company since shortly after they opened, and I've been consistently impressed.  Their menu is constantly expanding, and every single pasty I've tried has been amazing.  ALL of them.  There are only a few of the veggie pasties I haven't tried.  Outside of the original and traditional ones, though, the Rosemary Chicken and the Pilgrim have to be my favorites.  There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything, since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven.  It's exactly the right amount of food.  The owner is an extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and cool fella, and he's always looking at ways to make his business better.  He's chosen a great crew to meet the increasing demands of this growing hot spot, since everyone who works there is nice and down-to-earth.  I've never seen a single employee lounging or wasting time there.  What they do really, really well:  (1) All of the FOOD, including the salads and desserts.  (2) The beer selection is incredible, full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles.  (3) The prices are excellent.  (4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.  What they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.  Plus, you can't cut through tables to sit on the bench side of the booth anymore.  You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.  (A very small fault, considering that everything else about the place is incredible!)  Overall, this is one of Tempe's best little restaurants.  Whenever I'm not craving food from a particular location, pasties have become the default food for my whole household.  They're always tasty and we just never get tired of them.  I have to move out of state soon, and of all the places we've eaten in our 10 years here, I will miss the Cornish Pasty Company the most!!!",

The beer selection is great - including the brews on tap. Plus, $3 car bombs, always. $9-15 bucks later you're feeling like a champion, depending on your alcohol tolerance.

Each of our dishes was more than we could eat in one sitting. I had the Cajun Chicken Pasty and it was perfect! Not too spicy, full of bacon and the side of chipotle was amazing! Totally worth more than the $8 for size and deliciousness!  The staff was super friendly and once we sat down, they were right there to take our order. The wait time was pretty short. However, we got there at around 11:30am, and by noon there were no more seats available. Obviously the rest of Tempe knows just how great this place is. So if you want a seat, be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait. If you do wait though, it's totally worth it.",

I was skeptical because from the outside it look like the lights are out and walking in it's about the size of a hallway with a small room on the end.  I'm glad I persevered.  The beer on tap  english and cold.  The pasty menu is impressive -25-30 types.  I chose the Veggie chicken tikka masala.  Nice spice and served with yogurt.  I'm not sure ti's worth the money without a side of some sort but it was damn good and filled me up especially when paired with a couple 20ouncers.  The staff is cool and the music choices rock.  i know I heard some Nick Cave and some Tom Waits.  Left with an order of oven baked fries.  Cooked beautifully.  only complaint is that the jalapenos shold have been some kind of covering instead of served next to them BUT that said the peppers were fresh and hot and minced so fell nicely into the ketchup.

So far I've tried The Rosemary Chicken, The Pepper Steak, The Pesto Chicken, and The Mexican, I'd say The Rosemary Chicken was my favorite, but it really depends on what kind of mood you're in, there's really no way you can go wrong with any order...hey anything with that much butter in the crust could never be bad!!! ;)  The only thing I would change about this place is the happy hour.  A dollar off drinks doesn't really blow my skirt up.  Maybe some food specials???

My boyfriend and I just gave Cornish Pasty Co. another try, and were very happy.  The service was very good--our waitress, Katherine (sp?), was excellent, and did a great job of describing beer selections and making menu suggestions.  I ordered my usual pasty, but we also tried a few other menu items (some of the soups/side dishes), and they were excellent.

Basically, I'm trying to work my way through the menu! :) And for the love of god don't miss out on the dessert.  I love the food and atmosphere. Service is sometimes sub par but hey it's more of a pub atmosphere so it doesn't seem to bother me half as much.   Eat, drink and be merry with a pasty!",

It was like night and day from the first time. The server was so sweet, so attentive and she really couldn't have been any better!   I got the chicken tikka masala pasty and it was delicious, but a little too spicy for my taste buds. My bf and I each got a shepherd's pie to go and had them for lunch the next day. They give them to you partially baked, recommending you cook them the rest of the way right before eating. As we both ate them at work we cooked them that night and just re-heated them in the microwave the next day. Even reheated in a microwave they were so good!   Special props go out to the amazing server that bumped my rating up to 4 stars. :)",

Cornish has a separate menu for vegetarians. But make no mistake - this menu is not your usual disappointing veggie substitute stuff. It lists a variety of items that are delicious so I never feel like I have to settle. We've been to the Mesa location and love the ambience there. It has great service and is relatively easy on the pocket.   I highly recommend it.",

We were there about 15 minutes to 6 and apparently there isn't a hostess until 6. So along with the other people we fended for ourselves and my hubby and I found a table for 2. Usually dark and small places make me claustrophobic but I actually liked the atmosphere. It was like a comfy cave. And I loved the fact that I smelled curry in a pub.   It took about 10 minutes to get any service. Which slightly annoyed me because if we would have gotten served earlier we would have gotten happy hour prices on our beers. But luckily the server was great. Really sweet, funny, and informative.   The pasties do take awhile to be made, but that's okay because we had 32 oz beers to enjoy! They have a good, but not huge beer selection.  My husband ordered the oggie which he really enjoyed. He loved the sauce it came with. I ordered the pesto veggie pasty. It was very tasty. The pasty itself it so buttery and flaky. And the filling had Quorn brand veggie chicken which is my favorite brand of vegetarian chicken. So yummy. Next time I definitely want to order a spicier one. Italian style was good but I can imagine a Mexican or Indian one being even better!  Overall, worth the 20 minute trek to Tempe!",

I visited for the first time a few days ago, and let's just say it's not a good thing for my BMI that my office is less than a mile from here.  Plenty of vegetarian and vegan (!) options.  As a insanely and annoying picky quasi-vegetarian, I'd like to see more vegetarian options withOUT faux meats.  But, perhaps as I make my way down to that section of the veg options, I'll change my mind.  The place seems a bit more cozy (aka cramped) than I usually care for, but I'll be back for take-out and eat-in for the food and service alone.  Tip: there are two entrances. I came in the west side door and couldn't really figure out where I was supposed to order.  Make your way to near the end of the bar and you'll be at the register for take-out.",

    "text": "I went to visit the location in Mesa, AZ.  It was my first time visiting Cornish Patsy. I don't even know what a patsy is but I wanted to do a phone order. So I called in at noon on a Sunday for a phone order. I ordered the Oggie since it seems like the popular item on the menu. I also wanted to try the oven baked chips, so I ordered that with garlic and jalapenos.   When I arrived there, it had a fun, vibrant bar atmosphere. I like the decor, I noticed the whiskey bottles had this icicles on it. I went to the cashier/front to pick up my phone order. The cashier was very nice and responsive to my needs. Since my order wasn't ready, he kept asking me if I would like a drink. The wait staff also seems responsive and quick to others.  In terms of the food, the oggie was delicious. It was my first time trying an oggie. The outside was baked nicely and crispy. It wasn't soggy. It had a nice crisp but soft texture. The inside filling was soft and the flavors went well together. The red wine gravy also added great flavors to the oggie. Gravy was slightly sweet but also savory, so it brought out the flavors of the onions, potatoes and the beef of the inside of the oggie. The oven baked chips tasted like typical oven fries. The added garlic was delicious but the garlic aroma/flavor wasn't as strong as I would like. The jalapenos definitely added a kick to it, I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy. I ate the fries with the jalapeno and found it to be very spicy. Whenever I had garlic with the fries, it was delicious but I wanted more garlic to it.   Oggie reminds me of San Francisco's version of a peasant pie but slightly bigger and the outside has more flavor to it. It seems buttery, flakely. The SF one reminds me of a pot pie without a crispy crust.",

As for taste, I definitely give the edge to the salmon.    For dessert, I tried the Strawberry Palova.  It was good, but very rich so I could only a eat half of it.  The best thing about this place is that its very affordable for those who eat on a budget.  We had two pasties, dessert, 3 glasses of wine and a Sprite for less than $50.

There's either a long, dark strip of bar seats or a regular table area, cut off by the bar. They had quite a selection of pasties, but I went with the English Breakfast. It was quite the sweet and savory combo. The dough itself held everything well and it had a nice, flaky texture. The ingredients were OK, but it lacked any robust flavor. I dont know if this is staying True to the British cuisine or what, but everything was a bit mild in flavor. I was also taken back by how big these things were. They truly are the size of a calzone rather than an empanada. Service sucks here, but at the same time, it kinda fits the vibe. Lots of college kids, overworked and understaffed. I think what this place offers is worth trying, but unless they have something special that  Im unaware about, dont expect these pasties to rock your world.",

If you're craving for English pub food, come here! they do have other variations of pasties like Mexican fillings, but don't get that, stick with the typical English.  Stay away from the Curry fries, it's sooo salty for some reason!  The inside was designed very narrow which means seating is limited.  So you walk in and it's just a narrow path with 2-4 person tables and back area with bench seating to fill a dozen people.",

Also, if you like beer they have a lot of it and you can get steins if quantity is your thing.",

I've had the pleasure of trying about four of their pasties so far, and they have all been up to par in the taste department.  Although I usually go with Guiness, they do have a pretty nice beer selection, and they're priced not too badly!  I've only been to the one in Tempe, so I can't speak for the other location, but I would avoid going with a large crowd unless you want to wait for enough seats to open up to form something resembling a group setting.  Like others have said, there isn't a lot of seating inside and it is incredibly narrow, but I kind of find that to be part of its charm!",

My husband tripped over a black wooden box set against the wall while seating ourselves.  This was a Sunday afternoon setting in the Tempe location that we visited the restaurant.  If you want good, home cooked pasties, and don't mind the dark atmosphere & loud alternative music, this is a place to enjoy a great meal at a good price.  Bring your flashlight so you won't trip.",

What better restaurant to start with then my absolute fav, The Cornish Pasty. I live in San Diego and every time I come to Tempe it's always an absolute stop! Their menu is large and diverse and can please anyone! My favorite part is the vegetarian options that are amazing, even if you are not vegetarian. I have gone probably 5-10 times and every time try something new and love it. I have looked for places that sell Cornish Pasties in other locations over the U.S. although have not been successful. I wish I could wrap this place up, put it in my pocket, and take it with me on all my travels!   P.S- the PBJ dessert is AMAZING!",

Cornish is usually my default drink stop or eatery when I can't figure out what to eat. Menu is very robust and offers quite a few vegetarian offerings, which is very different and they are actually really good (this coming from a non-veggie).  My favorite is the non-traditional royale with cheese, but I haven't found one I don't like and I've had almost every single one.  They added some side dishes recently to accompany the pasty options and provides a bit more food than I can handle. There are quite a few beer options on tap with some really decent tastes of the UK and others.  I love being able to find Boddington's on draft and they have it here in 32 oz. mugs!  Again, DANGER!",

Visit #1: I bellied up to the counter so I could eat while watching the kitchen staff put together some of the dessert pasties. I ended up also sitting next to the manager or owner who was cracking away on his laptop. I didn't mind though, the building was small and he might not have an office to work in. My main issue with the ambiance is just how dark it is in there, it is almost like a seedy bar with really low hanging lights over the tables that emit very little light.  On this run, I tried the Rosemary Chicken pasty and it was awesome. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, the peppers tasted great and the potatoes were spot on. It was like eating a handheld rosemary chicken pot pie, but better. i wasn't a big fan of the mustard sauce, but the pasty was perfectly good on its own.  Visit #2: My coworker and I sat at a table that eventually got half-occupied by another large work group. It was a little distracting and the table situation should really be worked on, but I didn't see it as a big problem nor did my coworker.  This time around I tried the Oggie, a traditional pasty with steak, potatoes, onions, and swede with the red wine gravy. I've had some pasties in my time, but this was spot on and very tasty.  I will definitely be visiting again, though I will probably stick to eating at the bar...",

    "text": "Started patronizing this Cornish Pasty location when they were just a hallway and a kitchen.   The place was awesome, with food you couldn't get anywhere else in town, and a great selection of craft beers.  It was fun to sit at the counter and watch them make the pastys.   I wish that I'd reviewed the place previously, as I would have given them 4 stars over probably a dozen previous visits but I wasn't really a Yelper then.      Now the place has expanded significantly, and it appears business volume has kept up with this expansion, which means they are almost certainly profitable.   And that's what makes my last visit so hard to understand.    First, our table in the back corner of the dining room -- the glass surface was broken from what was likely a few too many full plates and empty pints being forcefully put down on it, and it appeared as if many a beer had been spilled on that section of the table because the metal latticework under the cracked section of glass was a mysterious dull brown moldy/mildwey color for a good 2\"-3\" to each side of the glass.  But the lights were dim and it didn't smell so we decided to ignore it.    Second, the men's room -- I stepped in here after we ordered but before our food was delivered.  This was one of the most disgusting restaurant men's rooms I've ever been in.  There was a lot of urine on the floor, broken tilework and molding everywhere. There were several paper towel dispensers, all of which were empty and appeared broken anyway, so I was forced to go find toilet paper to dry with after washing my hands.   All of the toilet paper rolls were sitting out on the back of the toilet or on top of what at one point had been a functioning tp dispenser.   To acquire some toilet paper meant picking the roll up off of a surface that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days or maybe weeks.  I wish I hadn't glanced at the toilet.  There are dive bars that don't even serve food with bathrooms that are 100x as clean as this one was.   Third, our food -- When I came out of the horribly filthy men's room, I should have immediately cancelled the food order and taken my family somewhere else for dinner.    That men's room was a sign.    My beer was not hot, but not cold, just cool.  It should have been a lot colder.  The three of us all ordered different pastys, mine was the Royale with Cheese, and we all felt sick late that night and into the next day.  If just one of us had felt sick, chalk it up to something else, but Cornish Pasty was the common denominator.    Finally, our service -- Our server was actually great.   She was prompt, checked up on us frequently, and got our orders exactly right.  She did a fine job, and the other stuff we experienced was not her fault.  I tipped her out well.  What I noticed though, was that while the place was slammed, other employees were, at times, inexplicably wandering around the restaurant with their phones held out in front of them, distracted, not paying attention to what was going on around them.   Not sorry to be an ass here - you're at work.   Snapchat your friends and Pokemon Go ANY OTHER TIME except for right now.      I don't care how slammed you are, how unique your food is, how close you are to the largest university in the nation or how many times I've been there in the past and been happy.  You can't manage a restaurant this way, there's absolutely no excuse for it.   If this place were to have received a health code inspection the night I took my wife and 17 yr old daughter there for dinner, I have no doubt they would have failed.   This is management's responsibility and ownership should hold them accountable.",

Cool, laid back atmosphere.  We were here at lunchtime and there was a pretty good crowd in there but we were seated with no wait. My husband, father and I each had a beer and then checked out the large menu. Excellent selections and even had a vegan/vegetarian menu for those that get into that sort of thing.  I had the Guinness stew pasty, which was perfectly cooked and reminded me of amazing winter comfort food. It came with a side of sour cream and chives sauce which was good, but I highly recommend asking for a side of the red wine gravy. It's awesome! My husband had the Cajun chicken pasty which was just a bit spicy and delicious. My dad ordered the porky pasty and he was impressed as well. Also had a side of the fries which were hand cut and just a bit over cooked on the sides and perfectly done in the middle. Just the way fries should be.  It's a bit of a drive for us since we are in North Peoria and we ventured to the Tempe location off of University, but worth the drive. We will definitely be back and also hit up their other locations when in the area.",

The baked fries are great but be careful, their jalapenos are no joke-incredibly spicy.   I thought the balsamic mushroom pasty was my favorite one and would def get it again.  Their immigration chicken is s little rubbery and needs some more seasoning.   The ambience is so unique, you walk in and everything is dark with black out curtains. Your eyes adjust though!  The study behind the pasties is on the menu and should Def be read! It's an interesting tale.   I wish they had a place like this where I live because it was like no place I've ever been before!",

I'd say its one places to visit if you are in Phoenix if you're interested in meat pies!  Parking: You can find parking in the back, and enter from the back although it does not look like an entrance. Someone will notice you and seat you.   Environment/ Service: The ambiance is casual and dark inside. They were attentive and had our order out in an orderly fashion.   Food: I don't know if I can recommend any filling because there is a good list of different kinds of pasties I still have not tried yet, and so far the ones I have tried are all delicious in its own way. I have tried the chicken pot pie, the peppered steak, and oggie. I like their filling to crust ratio. I hate to not get enough filling, but here,  get full off of the filling because the outer crust is thin, crisp, and not soggy.",

I've actually gone to the Mesa version quite a few times... and while this place is good it's not as good as the Mesa version.  Parking was a little rough as the lot was pretty full for lunch... I can't imagine this place on a Friday or Saturday night.  Pasty's in general are really good... and this time I got the Carne Adovada which was highly recommended by the server and some patrons next to us... it wasn't that great for me though for whatever reason.  The english pub vibe is great and the beer selection is awesome as well... I'd come back... but if I have a choice, I'd head to the Mesa location over the Tempe one.",

Being that it's been a while, I decided to try it again with a friend who loves it. It is a loud, dark restaurant with the window shades down and minimal lighting, so we opted to sit outside since it was a nice day. Plenty of seating available and our server came out within a few minutes with some menus and our drink orders. I got the veggie chicken tikka masala pasty from their wonderful vegetarian section and my friend ordered the chicken Greek, her favorite. I was pleasantly surprised with my pasty, I loved the Indian spices and the flavors worked together well. The portion size was just enough that I was able to finish it and be full. They use Quorn for their veggie chicken and it's got a weird texture but mixed with other ingredients in a pasty, it works.   Lots to choose from here, veggie and meat lovers alike. There's locations in Mesa and Scottsdale as well, with one set to open in Downtown Phoenix sometime. Check them out! You're bound to find something you like.",

We got the Oggie, Bangers and Mash, Lamb Vindaloo, and the Lovely Bit a Salmon. None of it really stood out and it was just too much breading and potatoes... On the flip side, all of their sauces were really good. Moreover, I usually love any kind of dessert but we got their Strawberry Pavola and it was weird and interesting.. but interesting in a bad way. The dessert looked pleasant but it was basically a mountain of whipped cream with strawberries, kiwi, grapes and syrup on it... uhm no thanks.  At least the service and the beer was good!

Had I not seen a soon-to-be-opened Scottsdale location, I never would've tried this place. You know, British food and all (keep in mind my British husband who loves these things called mushy peas,  \"Bubble and Squeak\" and some sort of kidney pie). Ewwww...nuff said.  Well, out of curiosity, I looked up the menu, and off we were to the Tempe location.   It's VERY dark in here, and I imagine that on some cold, winter day, I'd like to spend a few hours in here drinking beer, listening to the awesome music they play and fiddling around with some of the menu items I haven't tried. And I know that when it's hot here, we all like to hide from the sun a little. But seriously, it's a little difficult to see the menu. And the food.   On my first visit, I had \"The Porky\" which has pork, potatoes, apples, onion and sage. It's served with this delicious red wine gravy. I should've stopped after I asked the waitress for a to-go box, but I couldn't stop eating. It was wonderful. As in AWESOME.  Today, I had the Lamb and Mint. It had lamb, rutabaga, onion and mint. Also, that wonderful red wine gravy. Killer good.   And by now, you're probably aware that all of these delights are contained in this \"pocket\" of dough, baked and neatly sliced in two when they serve it.  If you sit at the right-hand part of the bar, you can see the cooks prepare all of the food, and it's really quite an art.   The best thing is this: they have all different pasties for all different tastes...italian, mexican, vegetarian, greek and even an American Thanksgiving pasty with turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, stuffing and cranberry sauce.   Check out the menu and try this place. ! They have fabulous food, good music and lots of fun beers.   God save the Queen. And Cornish Pasties....",

I ordered the lamb vindaloo pasty, a cup of leek and potato soup, and the Shirley Temple pudding. The person taking my order said the order would be ready in 20 minutes so 21 minutes later I was parking my car and heading in to pick up my food.   Getting into the restaurant was a little confusing. I chose the door that had the restaurant name on it, but once I entered, it appeared that I came through a back entrance behind the bar area. I made my way around to what I'd consider the front of the restaurant and was guided to the pick up area. The guys were friendly and my food was ready however they had my food on a plate and not prepared for take out. I had a seat while they got it together.  I'd say my pasty was very rich, spicy and flavorful.  I'm used to pepper so I'm guessing it may be too spicy for some. The pasty was full of meat and I didn't feel slighted in the least. The soup was great, would order it again, however, they put it in a styrofoam drinking cup covered with foil, not very travel friendly.",

Although the gravy and dripping sauce were superb, we hardly touched them.  The restaurant is dark and unimpressive but don't let that deter you.   Our server was super nice and responsive.  The order took a few extra minutes but it came out piping hot and fresh.  The entire experience made us want to visit the UK.",

The assortment of meat pies is phenomenal. Although you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu, my personal favorite is the Cajun. Between the flakey, moist, buttery crust and the spicy chicken, it is definitely a fine creation. Come check it out. You won't be disappointed",

The Oggie is obviously the easy OG, but I've tried the Pilgrim, the Cottage Pie, the Peppered Steak and the Bangers & Mash -- they're all yummy and a great delivery method for the delicious red wine sauce. I also really like the Pasta Salad w/ Sausage (not to be mistaken for the sausage salad which I haven't tried yet). Definitely one of my favorite AZ eateries.",

Still piping hot by the time we opened them up to devour them.    Definitely a fan and can't wait to come and dine in sometime soon.  There are quite a few pasties I'm eyeballing on their menu...I love all the choices!!",

    "text": "When we come to Tempe/Phoenix we are always excited to come check out Cornish Pasty. The place is usually dark & loud, which is definitely the atmosphere of this place (modeled to sorta feel like an old mine, without the coal dust). If you're looking for a brighter quieter place go to the library. Their pastys are freaking amazing. I think we've tried about 10 of them on the menu so far & our favorites are the Pilgrim & Roast dinner. The Pilgrim comes with a cranberry sauce that is super delicious with a red wine gravy style sauce that is also super delicious! The Roast Dinner comes with a creamy white sauce (still not sure what it is) and a red wine gravy sauce. We also like to get the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, if they have any available. If you like sweet super moist, rich, sorta carry desserts definitely try this. They some times serve it with ice cream, sometimes just cream, sometime both. The most recent time we were there we had both and it was so delicious (I think I like sticky toffee pudding with ice cream the best because it helps to cool it down & makes it even more sweet, but not sickly or overwhelmingly sweet). The only downside is the last two times we've come in they are out of hot tea. This time they were out of lemonade, but were able to 'find a tea bag in the back'. A British style restaurant out of tea? If this was London they would riot. This food is always delicious, atmosphere is unique, service can be a bit slow sometimes (that's because they're always busy in the evenings when we come), and bring a bag of tea just in case.",

There was one night that I came in with my boyfriend and they lost the tickets on both of our food. As an employee at another restaurant in Tempe, I totally understand that this happens and we were completely understanding. Not only did we get our food on the house, but the waitress was super friendly and apologetic for the mistake and brought us bread as well (which is REALLY good). I made sure to get a receipt at the end of the night in hopes that her name was on there- I think her name is Aurora.   In short, this place has the best service and food ever. xoxo",

This is a dimly lit hipster bar that plays loud(ish) music. I personally like those things, but I did see a few retirees come in that looked very sad indeed upon realizing this wasn't a cute little bakery.",

Pepper steak pasty was very filling but not large in terms of portion (it must have been all that starch from the baked bread). The various ingredients were fresh and right out of the oven hot. There were some nice mushrooms, peppers, and onions that complimented the pasties very well. The pasty may have been a little too salty for me but it was still delicious.   Another notable item was the oven chips. They were very delicious with its combination of flavor with the garlic and jalapenos. The ketchup that came along with the oven chips seems to be very fresh rather than using a bottle of Heinz.   Overall, a good impression from eating here after a long day on the road to Tempe.",

And I'm so glad we came! They were pretty busy at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Walked in, sat ourselves, and a server showed up a couple minutes later to take our drink orders. I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!  Our group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly.   The broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish.   Overall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!",

Jill, our server, gave some awesome recommendations on which pasty's to try. We got the Masala, and the Lamb Shepherds pie. Both were excellent. Full of flavor. I can't wait to come try the others. I just moved to the area and this is definitely a repeat spot. Service was on point. Price was too low for the quality. I would've paid more. Give it a shot if you want some old fashioned English pasty's.",

I'm a HUGE fan of the Cajun, it is absolute perfection with an amazing chipotle sauce that is the perfect compliment. Since I started going here, I've also come to enjoy starting off my meal with their garlic roasted potatoes (great to share with a friend). I've also tried the meat & cheese, which was great even though despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of sausage unless it's in a patty and comes next to some eggs and pancakes. Had a bite of the Italian as well, quite tasty in it's own right, although I picked out the big chunkier tomato, just a personal preference.  If the Tempe location is a bit cramped for you, and it DOES get pretty hectic in there sometimes, there's always their Mesa location which stays True to the formula but offers more seating room if you choose to dine in.   Don't make the mistake of not trying CPC at least once, I've introduced many friends (and even my parents) to this spot, and I've never gotten a single complaint. There is enough diversity on this menu that you can find someething for just about any range of tastes...hands down one of the most obvious 5 star reviews I've given.",

I Loved my  second try pasty !! I got the chicken pot pie and only slightly regretted it after trying a bit of my husbands which for the life of me I can't remember the name of .. . the  filling is hot and not soupy   (which was a pleasant surprise)  the pasty   crust is flaky thick and made to perfection-and i'm picky about pastry  pie type crusts . the apple  caramel pasty was like heaven and after a whole pasty each then the apple caramel  my husband and I had a hard time polishing it off  each of our halves  of it but it was delicious ! being skinny very hungry big eaters is quite a feat !  when we lived literally next door I wanted to see what the hype was about cause every night it was super busy ,so my husband tried to surprise me with a pasty the first time I wasn't a big fan it was the lamb with min combo and i just didn't like it at all .I'm not a crazy fan of the dark cave like decor or the loud music either .. just not my scene .  But if I want good comfort food I'll once in a while I'll order to go . the price is a bit too high( for  people on a budget to eat here often )   but the food was so good i found it  makes it worth the price .we spent around $24+ for just two people ...  .",

He then proceeded to move in and out, making eye contact with me numerous times, without greeting our table. After 10 more minutes of waiting, a female server asked if we had been helped. We said no, and she said that she would send someone out. 15 minutes later, and we still hadn't been approached. We ended up leaving and eating somewhere else.

This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.     That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.     The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...     Eat here. It's really that simple.      Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it.",

We thought the place would be larger, its a little small, but that's ok. It felt like we were in a British pub, and I've been dying to go to London. No, but seriously, the atmosphere is really cool and very original. Service as well as the staff here are very friendly and really cool.  I don't drink, but the prospect of getting to choose from tons of locally brewed and imported beer is appealing. We ended up ordering a cheese steak pasty and a chicken tikka masala pasty. I was extremely skeptical and thought I was going to be in for a big disappointment. What business did this British pub even have THINKING about chicken tikka masala? To my surprise, I think I just tasted the BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA IN PHOENIX. Hold up, Cornish Pasty Company, a BRITISH type PUB HAS THE BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA in PHOENIX. I know, you must think I'm nuts, but I'm Indian and I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing interpretation of a stereotypical Indian dish. The tikka masala overshadowed the cheesesteak which I thought was rather bland. I think the issue here was that the chicken tikka was so overwhelmingly awesome. I can't wait to go back and have the tikka masala again and perhaps try something else.  Everything here is super fresh, you can see them making the pasties and dough and everything. The pasties have a perfect texture and are golden brown on the outside. If you're unsure of what a pasty is, it is basically a chicken bake or calzone, but with different fillings. Really awesome.  It'd be awesome if the owner of this place decided to get a few TVs, then it'd be even more pub like. Also,  it'd be super duper awesome if he decided to pick up some English Premier League games on the weekends. I would most definitely come down for some breakfast pasties and watch a few games.",

I have also tried their Mesa location, much larger and could easily handle a big group. Customer service is great. If you are looking for fast food this is not it. Whenever I visit the area I like to pick up a cold pasty wrap it with ice packs and put it in my luggage to share with those back home; ten minutes in the oven and it's a beautiful meal.",

There was 10 of us and two menus to go around asked a few times for more menus they never came. Also asked probably six times for a child booster before we got it. She also forgot one of our dinners and it took 15min to come out after everyone was done. I'm pretty sure she is completely stoned out of her mind!!!",

    "text": "I live pretty close to this location and haven't done a new review in a couple of year so, to start the new year, let me just say that the Cornish Pasty Company is still a great place to go have a delicious pasty and some suds. They have a nice collection on tap and even more beers, I believe, in the bottle. I like that you can watch the food prep opera at the bar as they are continually putting together new pasties to keep up the supplies or, one of my new favorites, when the weather is nice, sit at the outside patio to enjoy the cool weather and the piped out music, which is audible but not overpowering.  My favorite pasties, which are a welsh savory pastry, are:  The Peppered Steak The Greek (vegetarian)  I'm also a big fan of their incredibly fresh house salads with pesto dressing - a regular is good enough for two people or half works for a single serving. I understand there are now locations in Mesa and Old Town Scottsdale but this was the original location and dare I say it, still my favorite. Worth checking out if you are looking for a place with good food and good beer, and people watching is always fun due to the location close to the University, it has a significant bohemian vibe and though I'm not a hipster (too old and too fat), it is fun to mingle with the more visible members of the creative class that Richard Florida writes about.",

Then after reading Preston's ROTD the fabulous Monica J sent me an invite for lunch to our closest location. The restaurant is a bit dark but inviting and our waitress Jenny got us served up in no time.(greatly appreciated on a worktime lunch hour) I ordered the Bangers and Mash Pasty, homemade pork with sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions and potatoes and more wine gravy on the side, not enough to make you tipsy but it does leave you feeling warm and fuzzy like good comfort food should. If you're looking to satisfy your appetite with warm comfort food, this is the place! Top notch pasties everytime!",

Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite places to bring friends because not only is their food delicious and their service excellent, but their cozy atmosphere really helps make your dining experience feel so much more intimate! Plus, with all the different pasty fillings on their menu, there is literally something for everyone. Even my vegan friends! I love the fact that they always offer at least two vegan options every single day. Their pretty diverse beer/cider menu also make it a great spot to meet for just some drinks, although I can never stop by without getting a pasty! The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because you cannot alter the contents of a pasty filling unless you give them a call 24 hours in advance. Although it is nice that you have the option of calling ahead and customizing your meal, most of the time I go there on a whim and do not have this opportunity. Being unable to remove certain ingredients is a bit of a bummer, and although I understand why this is not possible (I believe they are all pre-stuffed in the morning?), it still makes me sad.",

Once your eyes adjusts to the darkness its not bad at all. The food arrived quickly and was nice and fresh.   I ordered the \"Bangers and Mash\" and my wife ordered the \"Shepherds Pie\". We ended up splitting them so we could both try half of the other. I have to say it was really really good. The crust in which the \"pies\" are baked in are flaky and tasty.   I slightly preferred the \"Bangers and Mash\" (Homemade pork with sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, & an extra side of gravy.) over the \"Shepherd's Pie\" (Ground minted lamb or seasoned ground beef, with peas & carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, and cheddar. With a side of red wine gravy) But she got it with the ground beef instead of the minted lamb so that might have made a difference.   All in all my only regret was I did not save room for dessert, well next time, and yes there will definitely be a next time!",

There are tons of options here and it is perfect for vegetarians too! I go out to eat with my mother frequently and we are always in pursuit for great vegetarian options in the valley. This is the perfect place to take your vegetarian friend even if you love meat because their are so many options for both.   The only thing I can compare this to for those who haven't tried it is a more delicate calzone without the excess cheese, if you like calzones you will love Cornish Pasty.

    "text": "A Californian approved British pub dive with a decent array of beers on tap, a lot of which I actually wanted to try --  but, since I'm on a business trip, I figured I'd save that pairing for my next spring training visit to this cactus town.  Atmospherically speaking, it is dark.  The windows are blacked out with drapes, the ground is dark, the furnishing is dark, and with a tinge of yellow lighting throughout the place, you truly feel like you're in a medevil pub.   The menu is filled with a decent variety of classic, vegetarian, and modern/fusion pasties.  As a newcomer from out of town, it was quite hard for me to decide which pasty to get.  Although I really wanted to try one of the 2 portobello mushroom varieties, I ended up getting a classic, the cottage pie.  To fulfill my fungi craving, I paired it with a very garlicky, and very flavorful mushroom spinach soup.  The cottage pie was decent, but after the blast of flavor concentrated soup, my mouth was just not amazed by their spot on authentication, of the bland British classic.  If you want the classic, you'll probably love the nostalgia of the pie.  If you want flavor and the experience you get from lots of aromatic compounds, the Cajun chicken and Mexican pasty smelled wonderful.    I for one will be coming back for the balsamic portobello pasty next, which probably means tomorrow night since my trip here shall end the following day.  And I shall keep coming back with every subsequent Phx trip till I've satisfied my tastebud's curiosity.  I guess I'm a bit OCD when it comes to joints with a rainbow of the same type of dish.",

If you peek in you may think its just a bar, and indeed, they have a great selection of beer for such a small restaurant. However, it's much better than that. The Pastys--large hot pastries stuffed with meat and/or veggies--are fantastic and come in dozens of traditional and not so traditional varieties, including many vegetarian-friendly versions. Some of these utilize fake meat so something of the taste of some of the traditional meat pastys can be enjoyed by all. Some of the more eclectic pastys have Greek and Indian flavors. They all come fresh baked (you can watch the crew make 'em) too!   For $7, I was nicely filled, and got to people watch the varied crowd and crew of Cornish Pasty, all of whom seemed to enjoy making these unique hot pastries. In fact, they were so busy it was a little hard to get some attention. For example, I waited comically long for my bill to be picked up and charged.   No worries though. I can read my paper or talk to my friend while I enjoy the warm memories of my pasty.",

Dean, the founder, head chef and all-around professor of pasties, will be happy to add even more, being the good Cornish lad he is.   Now, there are a bunch of things I like about CoPaCo. First, the pasties range from the traditional to the totally off-the-wall. The recipes are so varied, from the Royal with Cheese to the Lamb Vindaloo and the Lovely Bit of Salmon, that I can't even pick a favorite. If I go there 10 different times, I'll eat ten different pasties. They're hand-made each day, including the dough. The kitchen crew at this place proves humans built the pyramids - these guys work their tales off keeping the pasties coming, and they make Amish barn raisers look lazy.  Second, it's just a fun place. There's usually good, hard rock 'n' roll playing over the sound system. It's a place where you can have some ribald antics and loud laughter and nobody cares. It's laid-back and unpretentious. The staff is courteous, though they can get a bit harried during the busy hours. But they'll always try their hardest and be friendly.  Third, there are some great desserts. The bonofee pie (graham cracker crust, whipped cream, bananas, caramel!) is my favorite.  What could be better? Eh, I'd ditch the taps that disgorge Kronenburg 1664 and Hoegaarden and drop in a fewer higher-octane brews. In the meantime, the cooler is full of bottled selections. The Skull Splitter is awesome!  Keep in mind that even though I gave it five stars, this is not a fancy, high-falutin' sort of place. It's absolutely perfect for what it is: a fun place to gather with your hooligan sidekicks, eat creative twists on the Cornish pasty and listen to some rock music. Brilliant!",

When I bite into an Oggie, I imagine all the \"Cousin Jacks\" in the mines from Bisbee to Jerome eating their pasty and leaving the arsenic tainted crumbs to pacify the \"knockers.\"  Dean, a native Cornishman, has blessed Tempe with the perfect belly filling fare for students, workmen, and tourist. His gourmet twist on the classics with curry and vindaloo will satiate the most hard-pleased epicure.   Have a pint and a pasty soon, and see what you have been missing.",

He is a great guy and he really took the time to learn his mothers way of making the pasty dough. Good for him for bringing a great piece of England to America.   The size of the place makes it just that much more or a neighborhood joint. The beer selection is great, Boningtons on tap! If you have never tried a Boningtons, try one, now!  The Pastys are awesome, the lamb and rosemary is my favorite. The meatball is by room mates. Irish Car Bombs for $3, I've gotten pissed in there ,more then once.   I know that it is a little hot,but we are in the middle of the desert, deal with it.   Thank you dean for bringing a little British to America.",

Wish they offered a plain meat, chicken and pork gravy as the reductions and sauces just aren't complimentary to all flavors of pasties and pies. Husband got a chix pot pie, gravy tasted like there was vinegar in it although it was supposed to be \"thyme chix gravy\". He has an ulcer and it made him feel ill. In all fairness, I would eat there again as I feel they deserve another try. Service is excellent. Friendly, helpful and fast. For this alone, give them a try.",

    "text": "Is it damning with faint praise to  say it's the best restaurant of its type when there's no analog within the city?      Until now  most of my experience with the pasties, or bridies as we called a  very similar dish In Scotland, has been uniformly  bad in the USA.  E.g  every  British theme pub has one on the menu  and seem to share the  same supplier.  This was so much better than I had hoped.  That they had draft cider too was  even better , a rarity in AZ, but perfect sense given the origin of the pasty in the English  West Country. Should have been Scrumpy ,a man can dream can't he?   The complaints about them not being traditional fillings is , well, odd. There wasn't a lot of variety in the UK diet,  less so on the working class end. So   On to the food.   Everything about the decor,  waiting time and suitability for groups is True.  Staff are friendly and  frankly it's nice to be left alone   rather than constant hovering.   Onto the food. Pastry  rocks,  they've nailed it.   It supports the  contents right to the last.     Fillings I had the Lamb Vindaloo which was close, but, but missing a sharpness/ e.g  vinegar, that I usually look for but it was still really good.  Dipping sauce complements it nicely.  My wife had the banger's and mash  version with  a red wine sauce.  Again  pretty good.   So why  four stars?    Many comments here have mentioned a lack of sensitivity  with regards to the flavors/ herbs and the thyme was   way overused on the bangers/mash gravy and it's  a shame as you could taste what they were trying to get at. Additionally the price may seem like a little on the high side ( would be  daily)  but  think about what you have paid for every processed , gray meat  excuse, of a pasty  and just smile.    Worth  working your way through the menu.",

The place is always pack and has a very diverse crowd. I normally sit at the bar to see how the pasties were being made but then again they seem to be the only available seats when I go. The beer selections were great. I either get a strongbow or hoegaarden (both of which are my favorites). I've only had the oggie and lamb mint pasty. Lamb mint was by far my favorite and I'd always get that one. The lamb was cook just right, tender and still juicy. To top it off the red wine gravy was amazing! Now that I don't live in Az anymore I'm craving for it! Out searching here in NorCal and the bay area for a good place that serves pasty! I would definitely recommend this place.",

Their tzatziki sauce is out of this world--and I don't usually like yogurt-based sauces. In fact, I can't think of a yogurt sauce I do like! Other tzatzikis fall flat in comparison.

If you park in the lot in front of CheBa Hut, walk past the first door that says Cornish Pasty Company and go through the second one. They have a back entrance also, but it is virtually impossible for me to describe how to get in. When you step in, you see the kitchen from both doors and might freak out because you'd think that you walked into the kitchen, but you are in the right place. When you walk in further, you will see the chairs. It is self-seating. Find a booth, table or sit at the bar. Your server will come to you.  Watch out for the banister when you sit in the upper level. The banister is not really for support but a part of the decor. It was not secure and popped up when I leaned on it.  The food was consistently good like the Cornish Pasty Company we tried in Las Vegas. The broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake was to die for. Slightly more al dente than the bake we had in Vegas, but it was still good. We loved scraping and eating the crusty cheese.   I enjoyed the Guiness Stew filled with a rich, robust, boozy filling (steak, mushroom, onion and carrots). My friend enjoyed her Cottage Pie (ground beef filling). We had the Shepherd's Pie (ground lamb filling) in Vegas. The pastry was beautifully golden brown. We had no room for dessert.  Watch out! The food is served piping hot here as well.  Lucky Tempe, you have a Cornish Pasty Company in your neighborhood. I am super jealous.",

The reviews were really good so we came by to check it out.  Food wise, the pasties were pretty good but smaller than what I was used to in the UP. We tried a few different ones and some we liked better than others.   They do have a decent beer list here.  As for the place itself, it was really dark inside and did not seem very clean. Black ceiling, black shades, low lighting. Also, the service was slow. I had ordered a beer and watched it sit up on the bar counter for a while before the server eventually brought it over. Same thing for the 2nd beer, there it sat and a different person eventually brought it over.  I liked the food Ok, but probably wouldn't come back if in the area again. Too bad the place isn't a bit nicer inside.",

The word \"pasty\" (in the context of Cornish pasty) rhymes with the U.S. pronunciation of the word \"nasty\" (how perverse is that!).   Traditional or non-traditional, authentic or otherwise, I have enjoyed every one of the pasties I've tried here. My favorite among the savory pasties is the cottage pie pasty. Well, is it even possible to go wrong with seasoned ground beef, mashed potatoes, cheddar cheese, carrots and peas all stuffed into a buttery, flaky pie? I think not.  The chicken tikka masala pasty contains diced potatoes and green peppers (not what you'd expect in chicken tikka masala) along with curried chicken.   The sweet pasties are great, but they are a rather large portion for dessert. The sticky toffee pudding is some of the best I've ever had.   The interior of the restaurant is very dark. Not sure what kind of effect the owners were going for, but whatever it was, it was completely lost on me.   The Cornish Pasty Company started in the Phoenix area, and has expanded into cities like Las Vegas and Boston. I'm just waiting for them to come to New York City!",

    "text": "While visiting the Tempe area for a conference as ASU, a member of our group of four was adamant that Cornish Pasty was \"the\" place to eat in Tempe. The rest of us had never even heard of the place, so we were excited to give it a try.   I would give our waitress 5 stars.   But I must take a few stars away for other issues. To begin, the place itself is really dark (kind of divey) which I'm not a huge fan of. Others would probably like it, but at 1pm, I want there to be a little bit of light in a building so I can see what I'm eating, others at the table, etc.   The pasty was \"ok\" in my opinion. The pastry itself is flaky and was pretty good. It seemed though that the filling varied at the table --depending on what you order, you may get something dry. I ended up getting a pasty that was supposed to be filled with spicy chicken and green chile but the chicken wasn't that spicy. The chile was just \"ok\" considering that we're in the southwest.   Drinks seemed expensive (and I'm talking about sodas here) and they charge for refills? I ended up getting a water.   Overall, I wasn't as impressed as others clearly are. Maybe we came at a bad day/time for the pasty. But I don't see myself stopping by the next time I'm in the area to find out.",

An entire restaurant that serves pasties. F*** yeah.  Came in--must have been a side door or something, by accident--to a dimly lit, long skinny room with tiny tiny booths along the wall.  Almost seemed to have a punk rock vibe going on.  Sat down, checked out the menu, found two pages of different pasties to choose from, almost all of them tempting choices.  Ordered the lamb and mint, and on a whim, poked my head into a doorway off what I thought was the main room.  This place is HUGE, and it looked like what I thought was the main room was actually just a little alcove.  There was a full bar, and LOADS of seats.  The food came, and it was delicious.  Filling, hearty, tasty--everything a good pasty should be.  Wish I lived here so I could try out more of the selection!  UPDATE: Returned and got the English breakfast and lamb vindaloo pasties. Keep the English breakfast, ditch the vindaloo!",

    "text": "This is an awesome place that is also open late (thank heavens, because my girlfriend and I often don't eat dinner until past 9 PM). They also have the best shepherd's pie pasty that we've eaten too. If you need a drink, look no further than their hard cider. The cream of leek, potato and Stilton soup is also a must-try. We ate here two nights in a row when we were down here in the Phoenix area a couple years ago and would almost eat here every day if we could.  If you're traveling through town and want to take some pasties for yourself and friends back home, give them about 20 minutes notice for a mass order and they'll get them nice and hot for you.   Back home in SoCal, we have the Olde Ship. We tried the mushy peas here as well as the sticky toffee pudding. Our consensus was that the Cornish Pasty Co. has better mushy peas (the Olde Ship puts mint in theirs, which we found to be kind of weird), but the Olde Ship does sticky toffee pudding better. But we'll definitely come here again if we're in the Phoenix area.  The staff is also very nice and are a fun bunch to talk to (they seem like a bunch of laid-back, easy-going college students).",

Busy or not, if you didn't call your order in, you'll wait 20-30 minutes for your food.  This place is both meat-eater and vegetarian friendly, so it's a safe place to bring your group of hipster friends who disagree about diets.  Pricing is more than fair at about $10 per pasty.",

And as a vegetarian, it blew my mind to see a food I would normally consider not veggie-friendly to come in so many vegan or vegetarian options. I am not huge on mock meat so I tend to stick with the Cheese & Potato pasty. However, what I have had of the mock meat is pretty crazy good. The dipping sauces are delicious and the breading of the pasty is phenomenal.   Great place to fill up on drinks and grub at a fairly reasonable price (and if you think it's expensive - it's worth every last penny).",

    "text": "To get this out of the way up front, the storefront picture here appears not to be the Tempe location. Maybe it's the Mesa place?  The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a \"kitchen\" with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.  The employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.  At $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.  The place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).  Bottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.  As the rating states, it's A-OK.",

That's how I felt when we (8 obnoxious, out-of-place, mob of hungry/alcohol feening Asian girls from So Cal) stormed in this low-key restaurant.  Yup, exactly like that, just totally different.  Cliffs notes:  Food:  4 STARS Dessert: 4 STARS Service:  3 STARS Price:  $8-9  The key here is the pastry.  The filling is really just the vehicle to the warm, puff pastry.  I personally ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, which IMO  probably was one of the few that didn't belong in a pastry.  The potato inside a pastry just doesn't go too well with me.  Luckily, I had 7 other girlfriends to free-load...err sample from.  The Mexican one was probably my favorite.    Also worth noting is the Apple Pastry topped with Ice Cream.  Warm yummy pastry and ice cream combined?  Simple, but yummie nonetheless.  Finally...come here during HH if you could.  $3.00 Irish Car Bombs.  Done.",

(pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine   we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves....   all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place...   i cannot wait to come back!",

Over the last 200 years, the sandwich has had its day, the hamburger did its best to satisfy, and fringe cultists have clung to the wrap, shawarma, burrito, or gyro for solace, but now you can have the real deal in all its glory! Soft, flaky, golden crust that makes every Marie Calendar's pie, Hotpocket, and Toaster STruedel hang it's head in shame! Variegated, creative, symphonious fillings that arch like piping hot rainbows over your fortunate tongue.

It was hard for me to find, it's located BEHIND the AM/PM more on Hardy than University in my opinion. We walked in what felt like the BACK door and immediately were struck by the cramped style of the restaraunt. I wanted to run back out and go to the bar next door, but \"D\" really wanted a pasty. So I gave in. We walked to the front and sat at the long table with the long bench. That didn't feel as cramped as the two-seater tables.  we both had pomogranate ice tea, which was delicious after I added sugar to it. I ordered the Chicken Greek Salad Pasty and he ordered the Peppered Steak pasty.  When the food came out about 10 minutes later and I dug in, I finally knew what heaven on a plate tasted like. Both Pasty's were cut in half so he and i switched half of each others food. OH! MY! My chicken greek salad pasty was delicious, the artichokes and sun dried tomatoes were so scrumptious. I loved the dressing as well. It was all so good. The peppered steak was also delicious, although I'm personally not a fan of mushrooms and it had many in it. But besides that really great food. I loved it.   They were deceptively filling, so I want to go back and try just the dessert. Was too full to try it this time.",

Pros: the waitress was good, kept my water filled repeatedly without being asked and checked on me regularly...reflected in her tip.   Cons: I really like curry so I ordered the \"curried potato\" side dish with my pasty. I wanted to like them, I really did but they were so salty as to make them inedible. The waitress apologized and took them off the bill.   The \"bangers & mash\" pasty was great but again the small cup of gravy was too salty to be edible..and I'm a guy who eats salty foods.OK, I didn't need the gravy.   My desert pasty arrived without the accompanying ice cream or cream sauce. The explanation was that the fridge unit with the ice cream apparently went down ....the ice cream was all melted....sorry here's your pasty without the rest of the desert.   Brandon (manager) stopped by my table;  he started out by saying he understood there was a problem with my ice cream...I had to explain that the ice cream wasn't served at all...he seemed surprised. He acknowledged that I clearly should be disappointed if the full desert described on the menu hadn't been served .... Got me my check...the full price of the desert was included on the bill.   I paid up and left. I know if I had asked him to reduce the price of the desert he would have done so...but frankly after visiting my table and learning that half of the desert dish hadn't been served, I shouldn't have had to ask.",

They have a wide variety for both sides and I believe they always offer a couple vegan options as well.   My favorite is the Veggie Mexican (Quorn brand \"ground beef\", egg, jalapeno, potato & cheese) and he loves the Royale with Cheese which is pretty much a cheeseburger and fries wrapped up in a delicious crust! We each usually have half a pasty leftover for lunch the next day if I can keep myself from overstuffing myself because it's so good. You also definitely have to try the Banoffee Pie(graham cracker crust with banana, homemade caramel & whipped cream). My mouth is watering just thinking about it! They also have a pretty big selection of beers I've never heard of if that's your thing!   The space is pretty small but I feel it kind of adds to the ambiance. My only complaint is that it's so far away. We need one in North Phoenix!  GO EAT AT CORNISH PASTY NOW!!!! (and bring me your leftovers!)",

As a small literal hole in the wall in a strip mall, you would never notice it if you didnt already know it was there.  We found this great place thanks to yelp, and decided to give it a shot.  The ambiance is fantastic; small, intimate, and classic with the painted cement floors and dark walls, it reminds me of New York back alley taverns.   The first night we went was absolutely PACKED full, but we still only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table crouched cutely in the back.  Our server was personable, and after going there a few more times I can say the whole staff is spot on.    Now to the menu.  Great beer selection at great prices always adds a star for me.  But that is simply the prequel to the awesomeness that awaits you with the food.  I have had other food but the pasties here - the pasta salad is delicious, good strong greek salad too - but its useless to try to compare it to the pasties.  They have every combination imaginable, from the hearty shepards pie and the oogie to culture fusions like the cajun, the mexican, and one of my favorites, the lamb vindaloo.  You would never think that these ingredients could be packed into a puff pastry and come out incredibly delicious, but it seems to be more of a delightful delectable experience every time I go.    Their desserts are so good too, last time getting the Banoffee pie to go, which was sinful it was so good.  One of the best perks about this place though, is that you can bring any 1/2 cooked pasty home with you - it just takes 10 minutes in the oven - and tada you have awesomeness on hand at home anytime you want.... something i definitely recommend!  Yet again, thank you yelp for a favorite of Phoenix, and if you havent been here yet, believe the hype and do yourself a favor!",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty Company is one of those rare places that makes you feel like you're somewhere special. A unique concept - at least I've never seen any other pasty restaurants around - makes this place truly one of a kind.  I have two favorites when I'm there. 1. the Royale with cheese with a side of ranch. 2. the pilgrim with a side of red wine gravy. The Royale with cheese is what you think it is - burger related. It's hamburger, cheese, onion, mushrooms bacon, and the best part - fries all snuggled into a flaky pasty crust. I like to dip mine into ranch for that classic burger tastiness. The Pilgrim is thanksgiving dinner. It's turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and onions. Served with a side of cranberries and gravy.  I always have a hard time choosing between the two because they are both so delicious.   The place itself has a cool, laid back vibe and the staff is always friendly.  The pasties do take a while to make though so expect to wait a while. These are not fast food in any sense of the term. If you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Especially at lunch.  Also, their seating is really best set up for groups of two.  This is not a \"take the whole family out for dinner\" kinda place. They have a couple tables in the back that can seat four but the majority of tables are two-tops and then there is space at the bar.  No question, Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite places in the valley.",

My man had the lamb vidaloo, and that was equally spicy and soooo tasty.  I got the banana carmel graham dessert thing too.  OMG!!!  So freakin' great.  Awesome.  Unbelievable.  Not sure I did the crampdness of the place, we ordered our stuff to-go and will probably go this route in the future.  Yum.Yum.Yum.",

One of the best things to get when you are hungover is an Australian meat pie or sausage roll...same concept.  My favorite has the be the Oggie because it's exactly like other ones I've had.  Love it and a must do!  Plus they serve bottles of Chimay...LOVE Chimay.  AND they have Pavlova, another Aussie favorite.  Hmmm, the Aussies are just British criminals, aren't they....it's close enough.   You have to check this place out!",

Specifically, both times I visited, I didn't like the dirty countertop (sticky, yuck!) or the dirty wine glasses hanging in front of me. And I didn't like having to either speak up or wait an extra ten minutes every time I wanted to order, get my check, or get my change on each visit. I even see people acknowledge the shitty service in their 5-star reviews and I don't quite get it.  It was damn tasty though.",

I am currently on my 10th different pasty (Just tried the Pilgrim) and I haven't been disappointed in one yet.    There is a great vegetarian menu as well.  I haven't ventured into this area of the menu yet, but all of those choices look just as delicious.    Every time I try a different pasty, it becomes my new favorite.  I'm sure you will feel the same way.  Dont pass up the $3 Irish Car Bombs!  Its so good when it hits your lips.",

It's fairly small with the bar on one side and booths on the other but it's full of big, loud, and alternative personalities. The music they play is awesome and the workers are all really cool.  The food is awesomely comforting and filling. The amount of vegetarian pasties they offer is incredible. The veggie pesto chicken is extremely flavorful, the eggplant parmesan is chocked full of various delicious veggies like zucchinis, broccoli, spinach, etc., and the veggie mexican is an awesome take on a typical breakfast burrito. The portions are always huge and I always leave extremely happy on my overall experience.",

My husband and I frequented often during the cooler months (Pasties are definitely a winter meal!).   I'm a big fan of \"The Pilgrim\" and \"Shepard's Pie\". The crowd is low-key and casual and the staff are friendly and accommodating. The only gripe I have is that sometimes the wait can be extremely long. I'm sure a part of it is prep and cook time, but sometimes I feel as though I've been forgotten about. Ordering out takes care of this and it also keeps you from having to wait for a seat during the lunch rush.  So glad to see local businesses like this introduce new food and culture to the mix.",

Don't get me wrong, the service is always good, and my beer never stays empty for more than a minute or two, if that.  It's got real character, a dark little hole in the wall place. Most of the time I sit at the bar, and the cooks make up for what the servers may lack in conversation or banter. I like that the cooks have a tip box too, that way I can hook it up if the food or cooks go above and beyond which is most every time. I'm scared to go to the other Cornish pasty because I'm afraid it won't compare... It looks a little too clean and contemporary and in my experience the original is always the best. Not a ton of people know about it, so it's great to take first timers there. The menu is vast, unique, and offers plenty for every taste. Every time I've taken a newbie there they have always, always, always been a big fan. Keep it up fellas, your doing great.",

We ordered waters and sodas while munching on a side of chips. My mom got the chicken pot pie and loved the crust and the moist chicken. I got the Meat and Cheese. Although I wish the cheese was a bit more melty the sage pork sausage was great. The dipping gravy tasted of beer. Great addition. The music was fun and the bartender dancing to the music was fun. Great lunch! Will go again when I'm in Tempe. Another plus: enough for left overs!",

We had so much fun with beer and music also last time that i hope the expansion didn't get rid of the hole in the wall feeling.  Anyway my coworkers are placing orders for me to bring back pasties for them.  I don't know how i'm gonna fly with those, but we'll see.   It's probably gonna be  110 plus or minus, but the fact that with of all the great places in phoenix im still drooling about this one means i gotta give it a 5.",

The ambiance was the first thing I noticed when I walked it. It's a very long, dimly lit restaurant with limited seating if you're not into sitting at a bar (which, I don't mind). One of the servers was quick to notice our group right away, and provided us with drinks as we waited for a place to sit. The beer was very diverse and exciting, which made me extra happy. The grub was great... I got the pork with mashed potatoes pasty with a red wine dipping sauce. I have to agree with past reviews and say that the dipping sauce was delicious! Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll be making my way back to this place.",

The food is absolutely killer here; I've tried four of the pasty's (pronounced liked nasty with a \"p\" not like tasty with a \"p\"-well at least that's what I've gathered from listening to the staff) and they've all been amazing. The best part is it isn't only the traditional meat cheese and potatoes. The options are all over the place and you can even bring your vegan friends. You can get a beer from the other side of the pond and the ambiance definitely feels like a good pub from across the Atlantic.  The only reason they aren't getting five stars is because my most recent visit; the bartender eating his dinner at the bar was clearly more important than my dinner. It's ok; it's not like with a hot meal I'd like to chase it down with a beverage of sort. The kitchen guys have always been extremely helpful and I appreciate them. The food is amazing enough and diverse enough to where I'll be back frequently, just hopefully not during my bartender's dinner time.",

This is the place I take my family or other visitors when they come to see me in Tempe. The pasties are absolutely one of a kind, with a taste you can't get anywhere else. I'd recommend the more traditional English types, by the way. Some of the weirder pastry flavors taste like merely their constituent parts: eg the lamb vindaloo just tastes like lamb vindaloo in a pastry. However the 'Oggie' or the pork with apples, they transcend their own ingredients like King Arthur riding a spectral dragon of flavor, reminding you of foggy London streets and rolling green hills of sheep!",

I went to Cornish pasty at around 4:30 PM with my service dog, and someone approached us and told me I would have to sit on the patio; I politely told this man that my dog is a service dog (he was wearing his working vest and everything) and he proceeded to point out that my dog was a pug (which he is indeed) and that we must sit outside because only service dogs are allowed inside. I very nicely repeated that he IS a fully certified SERVICE dog and he once again pointed out towards the patio.   Since my boyfriend's sister was in town from Louisiana and she really wanted to try pasties, I decided to be the bigger person and walked myself and my service dog to the patio.  I am honestly really disappointed because my dog should be allowed to go anywhere with me, and I feel like just because he isn't a lab or a German Shepard or a more commonly seen service dog he is not taken seriously, but he is fully certified to assist me, so what happened was extremely unfair and maybe illegal?   I most likely will not be visiting any Cornish Pasty in the future, but would like to let others know that this establishment does not respect individuals with disabilities.",

    "text": "Holy moly, why have I never heard of the pasty for the so many years I've been alive!?  Simply put, the pasty is the premium version of an empanada....and a super deluxe version of a hot pocket.    The boy and I drove here Saturday night around 8:30. The place was packed, and we waited about 15 minutes for a place to sit.  We were, as many others have mentioned, confused about where to go to get seated. A guy beyond the counter told us to just find an empty table to sit. I tried his technique and was stopped by another guy who told us to wait, and he'll get us a table.    I asked our server to see what's the most popular pasty, and he said there is one single pasty that sells more than the other.  So I would just suggest go with what you're feeling for the day.  I ended up with The Royales with Cheese, and my boy got the Bangers and Mash.  The Royales is basically a cheeseburger stuck inside the delicious, warm, buttery crust.  It had a weird garlic taste to it, which I didn't care for. The thousand island that came with on the side didn't go well with my pasty.  I still garbled that thing up regardless though.  I tried a piece of the Bangers and Mash, and I'm not a fan of it. I don't normally like eating pork, so I wouldn't have ordered this.  The boy really enjoyed it though.    Now, unto the BEST part of the meal...this is none other than their Banoffe Pie.  I HAD to get this even though I was already stuffed.  I have never had anything like this. Thick, crispy graham with creamy, homemade caramel, topped with whipped cream and slices of banana.  I've got a sweet tooth, and that banoffe was definitely one of the best desserts I have ever had!  I would definitely come back to this place again and again the next time I'm back in Arizona.",

    "text": "I recently hosted a rehearsal dinner for my son's wedding, and thought that Cornish Pasty would be a hit because the bride's side of the family originally came from the U.K., and they had out of town guests from England.  We had a group of over thirty, and I was a bit concerned about how it would go.  It was wonderful.  We sat in the patio, and each guest placed individual orders for both food and drink.  The staff was wonderful, and the service was quick, congenial and faultless.  Not only were they not intimidated in the least by our somewhat rowdy group, they seemed to genuinely enjoy working with us to make a memorable night.  The food was wonderful, and stood the test of the British relatives.  I had never been to Cornish Pasty before, and was looking forward to it as I had recently traveled to London, and thoroughly enjoyed the food.  I had the Bangers and Mash, and it did bring back wonderful memories.   My review would not be complete, however, without mentioning Shirley Temple's Pudding.... PERFECT!",

Please do not take a 1st date here.  All I have heard is about the expansion..and thank goodness!!   This place is dark, the staff look like they are all on tour of some skating boarding ESPN tour  in town.  BUT!!!!  The staff  (who look like skateboarders) were great!  Each one of them so friendly, polite and very attentive.  Beer selection-par none...excellent selection on tab.   The expansion section is inviting for large groups...which was perfect for our work HH. MENU- as my friend would say......UNBELIEVABLE! I took home a Carne Asada concoction and it was sooooo good.  The calzone idea is great! When you can come up with creative stuffing you can't go wrong.    Ambiance 3 ..too dark for me  Staff  5+ -very friendly, attentive & polite Food 5+- the calzone spin -UNBELIEVABLE...so good.  even take home.

    "text": "Great concept who would have ever thought that a restaurant that makes a 100 different types of British Pies could be successful.  But here you are with this place that blows away anything you would find in Britain that's for sure.  This place has a very eclectic atmosphere that's about the only was to describe it.  IT's got this very long bar area that goes along two rooms and the center of the bar area is actually the kitchen where there a handful of people making these pies all into the night.  I think I was there close to 12pm once and they were still making and baking these pies.  It's actually fun to watch.  The place is dark and loud so if that's not your thing than you might not be a fan but I love it.  All the pies I've had are really good and they do make a least 2 vegan options but they do run out sometimes so just be prepared.  There are also a very large amount of vegetarian pies with fake chicken and meats.  I had an Indian Vindaloo one that was really good and had a nice spicy kick.  All of the pies will come with a side of sauce for dipping and it really ads flavor to every bite.  The service here is top notch considering all the people and commotion of people making pies around them.  The people who come here are all pretty social especially in the bar area.  I've had people buy me drinks here because they are being friendly. Speaking of drinks they have a great beer and wine menu and it's reasonably priced.  Overall this is a place is a must try if you are in the area.",

It wasn't overwhelmingly busy, and we sat down at a table. It took 20 minutes to even grab the attention of a server to order drinks. Our server came back with the wrong beers (really?) and then a different server greeted us (45 min. after sitting down) and we told her we were being helped by someone else. So the original server comes back with our beers and takes our food order - by the way, they do not have anything gluten free here, despite what other reviews say. The server said they don't ever have gluten free dough or anything. So that was a huge bummer, because my boyfriend literally couldn't get anything on the menu other than a salad. We finally got our food and it was fantastic (I got the chicken pot pie pasty).  Service was \"meh\" at best, food was great. 3 stars. I don't think we'll be going back to this location, though.",

    "text": "Cornish is great and one of my top go-tos!  It is such a great concept and culture for a restaurant.  There are several locations in the valley and they all have a slightly different vibe with a laid back foundation. It's definitely a hipster crowd but not in a way that will make you sick to your stomach if you're not so hipster.  The tables are mostly long picnic table style which makes the scene effortlessly chill.  The menu concept is simple yet eclectic.  It's a menu full of pasties with so many variations for every taste bud out there.  There's the classic British ones and also some fun twists on Italian, Greek and Mexican flavors.  My favorite part of the menu is that they have a whole selection of pasties that are meatless and vegan.  They use meat substitute that tastes delicious!  It's a really nice treat for any vegetarians or vegans out there who are sick of eating salads at every restaurant.    I recommend visiting Cornish often and with all of your favorite people in life!  It won't let you down as long as your embrace it for what it is - inexpensive and chill",

I was trying to be healthy so I ordered the chicken tikka salad. The dressing for the salad is a yogurt sauce. I thought the sauce wasn't that flavorful in the salad. I think it was because the salad was more wet so the yogurt dressing was pretty diluted when mixed in. The chicken in the salad was pretty good and moist. I guess this place wasn't known for salads so I think next time I would get what they are known for. My friend got the bangers and mash. It was so good. The mixture of sausage and mashed potatoes made it taste really good. The sausage was well spiced and marinated. They included a sauce/gravy on the side but it was not necessary. The whole thing was super flavorful and good. I would highly recommend it!",

I'm sitting at a small table for 2 with dim red lighting and heavy metal playing across from the kitchen. first thing I noticed was the heavy smell of curry! interesting since this is clearly not an Indian restaurant.  got the banofee pie - it's kinda like a banana cream pie with graham crust.",

    "text": "We were in Phoenix unexpectedly for one night and needed a place close to our hotel to catch up with friends.  Based on Yelp recommendations tried Cornish Pasty.  Thankfully, we were able to sit outside where the noise level was much less than inside.  If you want to visit, don't come here on Friday night and sit inside!  Restaurant hard to find as there are no signs and windows covered in black curtains.  Pasties were excellent!  Didn't love the red gravy, but it was ok.  Had appetizers and salad and dessert, all very good and vegan or vegetarian friendly.  The chips (french fries) were delicious, although a smallish portion.  Four of us easily shared a full size garden salad.  I have not had a pavlova since visiting New Zealand 20 years ago and would come here just for that, it was fantastic.  All the desserts are huge too!  We will be back.",

I have never had bad service but I have had mediocre service; long waits for easy things like refills, and forgotten order items, but all that can just be a fluke. I am in love with the food and even the people there. Everyone is cool to be around and no one is rude.   There aren't substitutions or \"create your own\" options, but as an extremely picky eater, if you can't find a pasty you like, you should probably go to burger king and have it your way.  Also the beer menu is great for Beer snobs, and welcoming enough for average beer drinkers alike. I don't drink wine, but it looked like a long list of options.   All in all this is a near perfect establishment. If you are looking for a unique place to take someone and fill up on home cooked flavors, this is the place in Tempe. I happen to prefer the N Scottsdale Rd. location, but to each their own.",

My wife was a big Cornish Pasty food fan prior to us finding this place, and I have to say that she made me a believer when she brought me here.  The food is tasty and bona-fide as far as I can tell.  Did not know that they made the Tempe location dark on purpose to mimic a mine--thought it was to go along with the emo/Goth/lots of tattoos and face piercings crowd that appears to be in attendance--which is great if you're into that sort of thing (we're not).  The Mesa/Chandler location is a bit more open, lighted, and civilized (in terms of face piercings).  Very pleasant and helpful service coupled with tasty victuals, minus the face piercings = 4 stars.  Hate to have my personal bias short them a star, but it is just a bit off-putting if you're not expecting it (and if you show up wearing your Sunday best).",

I discovered it back in 2005, shortly after it opened, when a friend told me about it; it's gotten pretty well known now, but with its location, it's not the kind of place you'd just stumble upon.  I've tried many different pasties, and I keep coming back to the Oggie (the \"Original Pasty\") with the red wine gravy. Paired with a Hoegarden, it's the best meal for the money in Tempe.",

We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.  My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey.   I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.",

    "text": "You know how when something has been talked up and talked up for what seems like an eternity, it's often a let-down when you finally try it for yourself?  Well, Cornish Pasty is nothing like that.  It did not disappoint.  Great atmosphere, service, prices, and of course amazing food.  We started with cups of homemade soup.  The split pea was fantastic.  Definitely worth navigating around the little bits of ham, which, as the waitress had assured me, were not too terribly prevalent in the soup.  Sorry, ham - I don't like you.  My friend's cream of tomato soup was delicious as well.    We then shared the rosemary chicken pasty.  I'll be honest: this was not among my top 5 pasty choices on the menu, but my desire to share rather than order my own and eat myself sick prevailed and I decided to be flexible.  It's always nice to be flexible anyway, right?    In speaking with our server, we found out that the pastys are made ahead of time so they can't really be customized.  Normally I might be appalled by that, but there's so much crap in there that maybe it would take an hour to prepare them on the spot, and with so many menu options you should be able find one that you wouldn't want to modify.  So I'm okay with the pre-made factor.  My sixth choice pasty actually managed to wow me.  The bread and all the ingredients complimented each other perfectly and tasted great with the accompanying sauce.  I can see why Cornish Pasty has such a loyal following.  Can't wait to bring some more friends there for the oohs and aahs and exclamations of 'how did you find this great place?!'  The credit goes to Yelp.",

    "text": "Reasons Why I Love CPC:  GREAT FOOD GREAT PRICES GREAT ATMOSPHERE NICE STAFF DELIVERY!!   I had never tasted the glory that is a pasty until I went there by recommendation of a friend a few years ago. Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.    The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency.    Another time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch.     I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus.    My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.     To be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner.    Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING!   Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well.    They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!   Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.",

    "text": "I'd probably give this place 5 stars, except that no place deserves 5 stars until I've had at least three stellar experiences there. Give me a few weeks, I bet I can make that happen.  I stopped in here on Sunday for lunch about 1pm. We walked in to this small, narrow... PACKED bar. Misconception #1, it never occurred to me that we might not be able to get a table!! There was one very large rectangular table near the back, and thankfully the trio seated on just one side of the huge table, graciously allowed my party of two to take the other side. Whew.  I ordered a beer (The waitress even recommended one that wasn't on the menu yet, nice touch) and my sister, who is much better behaved than I am, ordered a water. I ordered the chicken tikka masala pasty (I'm sure it's not really traditional but I have a thing for indian food at the moment) and my  sister got the Chicken Greek.   And we waited... and waited. OK, Misconception #2  :) I mistakenly thought this would be sort of a fast-food place.  It wasn't! It was about a 40 minute wait for the food. And I am NOT complaining... I'm just saying... I had a misconception! It was SO GOOD I'd have waited double the time (although I'd be drunk by that time, considering what a good beer selection they  have, no good would come from that!). Incidentally, the service was quite good and responsive, especially considering how busy they were.   My chicken tikka masala was very flavorful, but only slightly spicy (The waitress told me they make their curry in-house, I assume they make it only mildly spicy to accommodate all diners), I was impressed. My only complaint is that the potatoes inside my tikka masala pasty were still quite firm... but that's probably a matter of personal preference. I like potatoes well done, not still firm. My sister was very happy with her Chicken Greek and she's such a picky eater (I love you Julie!) that it's a damn miracle she liked it that much.   Oh, and our bill was like $22.00. Awesome, I can afford to come here all the time!! We will certainly be back, I look forward to being able to upgrade this place to 5 stars.",

If you care about things like: customer service and appropriate wait times (at the University location, not the other one), I would suggest not vising this restaurant.  I've had many experiences with Cornish Pasty. My friends love it, and when it comes to the food, I love it too. (Especially the pork pasty.)  I've only had one good one though--and that was when I sat directly at the bar and told the woman standing there what I wanted.   The a few of the other times happened something like this:  1. Went in alone, waited fifteen minutes for anyone to come over and even wipe down my table, let alone ask for a drink or dinner order.  2. Went there with 4 other friends, waited 2 hours for a table, and the gentleman acting the 'host' was especially rude when we would ask him about how long he thought it would be (roughly ever 30 minutes) and he always said \"Looks like 15 more minutes.\" Then when we were finally seated our drinks came back half empty and my pasty was cold in the center.  The truth is, is that while the food is great the company needs to retrain it's workers. Customer service should be at the top of their list, and from what I can tell it's at the bottom.",

    "text": "In terms of \"pubs\" in Tempe, the Cornish Pasty is by far and away the best of the best. With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down.   To start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun.   Next, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno.   For the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery).   Finish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP.   5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend.",

    "text": "Dude, I am like Lil' Jon guest backin up Usher with this place \"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!\"  Friends have been telling me this place is fantastic for months, but I think my imagination of this place hindered me...I imagined a dirty beige dining room with blue checkered table cloths, rickety wooden chairs, like, MOM art on the wall, and cutesy crap with bad beer and hot pocket like \"treats\". Some late times at Time Out led me talking to a lady who works there, who told me of the Vegan Pasty one calls 45 minutes ahead of time. At 2am, with some amber bock, oh man, I was STOKED. I woke up the next morning, counting DOWN THE HOURS till I could dial that number for the vegan goodie. She recognized my voice, and I didnt have internet, so she was sweet enough to list the ingredients-I ended up getting eggplant and a bunch of other veggies.   My companion picked me up, and its on the HARDY side of the University and Hardy, fyi. We walked into a long, kind of dark hallway with small two seaters on the right and a bar on the left. Dude...were we in the right place? This place was SLEEK-black and white decor, clean, hip, I mean, like URBAN chic man, but not pretentious. Since it wasn't too buzy, we did the two-seater and she took our beer order (yummy beer selection-we did miss the happy hour at 5pm, but the prices were still fine), and ran into some friends.   The real star of this story is really the Pasty-I learned I could add some Quorn (the best meat substitute EVA), but that was ok. My food with some sauce was amazingly comforting. Not overly spiced, not overly cooked, loved the taters in it, I mean, there was nothing wrong with it-NOTHING. Like a shephards pie, or a pot pie, or a calzone, who doesn't love a warm fold...? Yeah? Yeah? This is the bomb. AND even though I was starving, I could barely finish it, but I felt perfectly content aftewards and not overstuffed at all.   I even have their sticker on my CELL PHONE to advertise my love for this place-yeah, you heard right. I fucking BLINGED my cellie with Cornish Pasty!",

    "text": "Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative.   If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality.   Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean.   I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is difficult to save room for my old favorites.   Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.  If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.    After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.  Edit (4/30/2014):  Food's still good... but...    The service has gone down hill. What was once a staff of edgy, unique, and skilled individuals. They are now mostly pretentious hipsters, with a bad attitude and below standard skills at basic service.",

    "text": "Eek!  This was a second time in just a few weeks I've had a \"Meh, I've had much better experience!\"  What has happened to Cornish Pasty???  So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something....   Service~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....  Food~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....  So for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!",

This place is a pure dive bar... if locals scare you...don't go around here because that is all you are going to get.

Yesterday I finally did and my tummy has never been happier.  I love the ambiance of the place. It's very small, though they are working on an extension. The employees are all tattooed and rugged, which made me feel right at home. Motorhead, System of the Down, and other older rock and roll and metal music pumped through the speakers, making my ears nearly as happy as my stomach.  They have an extensive beer collection with different options from all over the world.  I had the portobello chicken pasty, and it was wonderful. The insides were so delicious and the crust was decadent. It was a lot of food, but I was determined to finish it.  I've heard this place gets super busy at peak hours and I'm not surprised. I am already looking forward to going back and trying another one of their delicious concoctions.  You can also buy their pasties uncooked so you can make them at home!",

Let's face it, we all LOVE finding an out of the way place with really good, reasonably priced food, don't we?  It just tastes better!  CPC delivers on all counts.  It's kinda loud (but I liked the music, so that's OK :) and kinda dark, but that's OK too.  Pasties are English pies miners would take to work for their lunch.  The Missus had the Shepherds Pie pasty (she had the ground beef, but lamb is an option, as it should be) and I had the Indian curry pasty - two big hits!  The pie is crusty, golden brown and delicious outside, nice and delicate inside.  Fillings are yummy, service was great!  The House Special pasty has rutabagas in it, which I despise, and the friendly server was most apologetic that they couldn't take them out, but said if I called ahead they would be glad to remove the offending root veggies with some advance notice - nice of them to offer to accommodate my distaste for root vegetables in general (and rutabagas in particular).  In summary: great, interesting food, friendly service, reasonable priced - we'll be back and I recommend you stop by as well, and see what this whole pasty thing is all about!",

I generally stick to the vegetarian menu; last night I tried the eggplant parmesan, which was incredibly satisfying. And they do have some rather decent beer on tap.

    "text": "So my friends from ASU had mentioned this Irish pub place that served what was called a \"Pasty\". From the sound of things, it was a hot pocket/pie sandwich type deal. They mentioned an array of options from pepperoni to peppered steak etc. All that being said, decided we should go there for dinner the night before I left Arizona. Especially after I saw 860 reviews with 4.5 stars up here on yelp. That's virtually unreal. Never had seen such ratings with as many reviews. Any who, drove up to what looked like a dead shopping strip with a bunch of stores/restaurants that looked closed due to the dark tint of the windows. When we opened the door though, it was actually pretty mind blowing. Walked around from what I guess was the front door to the bar side. Honestly, first thing I thought coming around that corner was that this place looked like something off the set of man vs food. Can't really explain it but if you're familiar with the show and happen to make a stop, you'll understand what I'm saying. So we sat at the bar and got our orders. I wanted something spicy so I looked out for something that I thought would match my liking on the menu. Found the Cajun chicken pasty which was spicy marinated chicken, ham, bacon, with chipotle sauce. My girlfriend ordered the bangers mash which was mashed potatoes, meatloaf and gravy. My Cajun chicken was amazing. Spiced to perfection as was hoping. My girlfriends bangers mash was ok. Not as much flavor as my Cajun chicken but still pretty good. All in all, I would highly recommend this place. It definitely lives up to the 860 reviews and 4.5 stars, a rare occurrence. Only mishap, which really isn't a mishap, is that if you decide you want to add any custom pieces together in your pasty, we were told you would have to make such request 24hrs in advance. These guys make the sandwiches hours in advance so that it's just put into the oven upon order. So if you're the type to want to customize your order, I suggest you call in advance but you likely won't make the a wrong decision with any of the available options.",

It's almost like a long hallway.  To the left, theres bar seating, with some really high chairs-thats where I sat.  To the right, against the wall, theres some tables for two lined down the side.  In the back, there seems to be a set of larger tables for bigger parties.  The place is kind of drab and dark.  Not what I had expected.  Dark tile, dimly lit.  The kitchen area is immediately behind the bar, and you can watch the people work as they make your food.   The staff here seems to be a younger crowd, early 20's.  Kind of hippie-ish, but in a good way.  They all seem to work really well together.  I kind of got a student feel when I was in there.  When I sat at the bar, I was greeted immediately by a really nice guy, who offered me a menu and asked if I needed any help.  The menu is really large, with a nice variety of pasties to choose from.  I got the Philly steak pastie, and it was really good!  I think they make it fresh when you order, which I loved.  The servings here are large, and I was unable to finish my entire pastie, so please remember that when ordering.  Aside from a minimal wait, I had a decent experience.  I didn't care for the dark n drab decor, but overall, it was a good experience.",

    "text": "The CPC is about a block from my condo.  Since I moved to Tempe, I've gained about 15lbs.  I'm fairly certain a large portion of this has to do with this restaurant.  When I cut myself shaving, I bleed red wine gravy.  I frequent CPC more than I should.  Guilty as charged.  The food is just...so damn good.  I'm also a fan of their dfraft beer selection.  32oz mugs of Hoegaarden or Dead Guy ale?  Yes, please.  I've turned many people on to the wonders of this place.  Out of all of my friends that tried it, the only one that didn't fully appreciate it was the one that had a lap band.  I don't recommend this place if your stomach is the size of a walnut because there will be some damage.  I've tried nearly all of the pasties (with the exception of the vegetarian ones) and it's difficult to pick a favorite.  I guess if I had to narrow it down to three, I'd choose (in no particular order), the Oggie, the chicken greek and the pilgrim.  Damn delectable!  I've also had their pasta salad.  It's huge.  I probably wouldn't get it again, though.  Why would I get that when I could have a pasty?  I thought I knew what comfort food was until I had my first pasty.  OK, so what about the interior?  There isn't much of it!  It's a hole in the wall.  The Mesa location is quite bigger, so if you're dead set on trying the food on a Friday or Saturday, you may want to check out the Mesa setting.  I've only had to wait for a table once, and it wasn't for very long, but I tend to visit during the off hours (late afternoon or later in the evening).  If you're flying solo, don't be ashamed to hop on a bar stool and watch the 20 something hipster dudes cook up gravy and other vittles.     Speaking of the employees, they're a motley bunch.  Service is usually pretty decent.  If you're a fan of tattoos, nearly all of the employees are inked.  It definitely lends a sense of style to the place.    There's a single unisex bathroom in the back.  If you gotta go, you gotta go.  I suggest forming a line if it's in use because I've seen people treat it like an airplane bathroom: they'll keep looking over their shoulder to see if the person inside has left and then get up, only to be cut off at the pass by someone seated closer doing the same bit.  I've only had one bad pasty experience.  My pasty was slightly over-baked.  I think the guy that baked it was over-baked, too.  Look at the eyes of some of the cooks.  They're redder than the gravy!  At any rate, that one pasty doesn't warrant the loss of a star compared to the dozens of other perfect pasties that I've had.  I recommend this place to everyone.  Leave your diet in your car and enjoy yourself.",

Some other recommendations are the Shepard's Pie or Chicken Pot Pie. They even have vegetarian pasties. One important fact- you can't modify the ingredients. They come as they are and they are delicious!!",

The spicy pepper or chili seasoning overwhelms the goodness of the meat, potato, and (presumably) rutabaga.

While many pub classics exist on their menu, I've yet to see a pasty on anyone else's menu, let alone one as good as the ones at Cornish. My personal favorite is the chicken rosemary, with a side of HP sauce. Oven chips are a good appetizer, since it'll be about 30-40 minutes before you get your food. Awesome selection of import beers. Service is good, even when busy. Only downside is that they feel a bit overpriced, considering how much side dishes cost and no combos are available. For two people ordering pasties, 2 beers, and two sides, expect to pay around forty or fifty after a tip and tax. That said, you'll leave full!",

When they were still serving your pasty in a basket, cheap tables and chairs, no liquor license, you always saw the owner there working and the menu was so short.   Oh, how its grown, and I love it even more now. The new expansion is awesome! The beer they have on tap is fantastic, the staff is always welcoming and friendly! They've done such a great job. I recommend this place to everyone and I try to visit at least every couple months or so. Every time someone visits from out of town, I make sure to bring them there. If someone has never heard of it before, I tell them all about it. Many people have been pleased by going after I tell them about it! I've never heard any complaints. I only have 1 of my own, and its never stopped me from returning. I had one bad pasty, too much garlic. I can't say how many times I've visited, but its always been a very enjoyable experience. I will keep returning, keep talking them up and still bring in new visitors with me!!   I love the Royale with Cheese, Cajun Chicken, Chicken Alfredo is my favorite, Pesto Chicken and Rosemary Chicken. I always want to try new ones, but I love getting the ones I know I already love! Oh, and you must try the banoffee pie! I'm not a sweets or dessert person, but oh my, it is to die for!",

If you don't mind sitting on an unknown someone's lap then lunch rush is probably not a problem for you. Elbow room is the only thing that is lacking here.

Their side dishes and soups are also delishious, and they have an excellent beer selection.    From the outside, you would not expect this place to be so unique.  They're tucked off University in a strip mall, and half the time they forget to turn their sign on.  Don't let that fool you, they hold pretty late hours.  And, they're always busy so if there's more than two of you, be prepared to wait for a table.  The atmosphere is very casual and unpretentious.  The waitstaff is very friendly, and I think there's a mustache requirement for the guys.  From a seat at the counter, you can watch the kitchen prepare your meal.  It's pretty impressive how they operate in such tight quarters without burning or stabbing eachother.    Bottom line, this place rocks.",

When it comes out you might not think it's that much - but portions are deceiving because the food's pretty heavy. My main tip to you is only eat half and then pause to let it sink in - take a break to drink your beer or something. I always force myself to save the second half and it makes me much less sleepy when I head back to work after lunch :) Plus it makes great leftovers.",

    "text": "To review or not to review, that's the question I've been struggling with. With 50 reviews already, what more could little ol' me possibly add? Absolutely nothing, I knew.  But then, today turned out to be a special day... I was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?  It was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.  So, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).",

The beer selection while I didn't partake this trip is A+.The food....yes!  I met the lovely Sarah G. here and loudly remarked on her review point of a pasty being \"a glorified hot pocket\" just as our waitress came by. Oops.  English accent? Check.  As stated a brazilian times the chicken tiki masala is tops. They come split in half so Sarah and I traded halves and I also got to try the pilgrim. Definitely amped my excitement for turkey day. both selections were tops.  I want to go here and drink and eat like a king one night.   Sarah changed her tune and decided it was definitely better than her last trip and even grabbed a few uncooked to feed the family that night. How cool is that?",

    "text": "Things to know about the pasty:  #1. It's pronounced \"PAST-ee\", not \"PASTE-ee\". One you eat; the other taunts you. #2. It's meant to be filling because the damn thing was invented for miners and as such, was never intended to be served with gravy.  Things to know about the establishment itself:  #1. It's dark inside for a reason - to mimic a mine, where the pasty was standard fare back in Britain, not because they're trying to be hipsters. The clientele does that. #2. The patio is smoker and pet friendly. Inside, the long tables and bench seats aren't particularly convenient for anyone with long legs or a rubenesque shape.  Review:  Tried the Oggie for myself and a Porky for the little lady. She got a cup of the potato and leek soup and loved it. But with the full slice of bread it is served with, she couldn't eat the entire pasty herself. Both were quite delish, however.  I was disappointed that the ONE beer (Hefeweizen) I was longing for out of the many fine selections on tap was \"out\". But, our waitress recommended I try a Hoegaarden instead. I requested a slice of orange added for good measure and found it to be an acceptable balance to the Oggie's heaviness.  Honestly, I come from Wisconsin near the U.P. of Michigan and am partial to their style of pasty up in the Yoop. Not that what I had wasn't tasty, but the red wine gravy was a -- shall I say, unusual? -- flavor accompaniment. It's just a personal bias of mine.  Anyone who has never had a pasty before will enjoy any selection on the menu.",

Boy was I wrong; I fit right in with my ripped jeans, straight bangs and tattoos!! The people at this place rawk. (yes, I actually typed the word \"rawk\")  Anywho, this place is absolutely amazing. They have a whole entire page of veggie creations that make me salivate just thinking about them! I have had the Veggie Mexican (by far the best IMO), the potato and onion and the cottage somethingorother... and oh brother, I loved them all.  I think that the small dining space, worn seats at the bar and the fact that you can see your food being prepared adds to the experience.  My only complaint is that it takes a bit to get your food, but they fill your drinks while you are waiting, so I can deal with it.   They also have Irish Car Bombs. Very cool. Very, very cool.",

Okay Yelp, I can't be mad at you because your little mobile application showed me what was close to me for lunch when I was down in Tempe at the Japanese market buying some Echigo beer which I discovered while at Yasu.  Amazing, simply amazing, I saw the outside of this place and was like, \"well here we go, another smokey pub filled with old timers\"  But as I passed through the front door I felt as if I had been magically transported to somewhere back east, a hustling bar with employees shouting orders and pressing fine pasterys and a decor that would make even Gordon Ramsay proud.  I had the traditional being that I've never had a \"patsy\" before and it was simply amazing, beef, potatoes and a red wine gravy that made my mouth go, um what the hell just happened?   They have a huge variety and it was really cool to see one of the kitchen members sitting next to me trying out one of the new recipes and critiquing on it.....huge brownie points in my book..   Best part, 10 bucks for lunch including a 3 dollar tip. SCREW YOU ECONOMY! I'll be back for sure!!!",

It's a very young college crowd and the place definitely has a trendy vibe to it. The waitress was very nice and that was probably the highlight.

Service here was great, the staff seemed to genuinely want to make it great.

    "text": "You have a lot of choices when it comes to food in Tempe but Cornish Pasty has been a staple of the area for years. There's a reason why they're one of the best reviewed restaurants in Tempe.   You might also notice their success has them expanding to multiple locations. It takes awhile for these new locations to find their legs, but Tempe is the original Pasty that started it all. An excellent staff and unique atmosphere compliment some of the best food you're likely to find in the area.  Oh, and they have an extensive assortment of beers on tap, many imported. They treat the beer with respect here, ensuring every pint is served up fresh. It sounds gross, but many restaurants don't properly take care of the hoses that connect the beer to the tap -- you end up with half your beer sitting outside of the refrigeration and going stale. Pasty's staff make sure everything is fresh like any proper bar -- something unique for a restaurant to do.  My personal favorites include the Cajun Chicken, Tikka, Meat and Cheese and the Royale. Honestly, order anything off the menu and you really can't go wrong.  Make sure if you order chips to ask the server for the 'wild' style, which includes baked garlic and fresh jalapenos. Adds an amazing kick.",

    "text": "First off, the food here is so god damn delicious it should be a crime. The pasties, chips, soup, broccoli bake - all of it is good.   The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because of the service and seating setup. Most of my friends understand that eating here is kind of hellish and is usually to be avoided. The seating is very limited - if you're claustrophobic forget it. If you come with more than 1 (2 at the absolute most) people, forget it. There are two booth-table hybrids, way in the back, but be warned that your server will inform you that at any time, no matter how awkward, complete strangers are allowed to just plop down next to you at the same table and join your party. If you are a Larry David type individual with a need for personal space, you're gonna have a bad time. If it fits, they sits.   As far as the service goes, the soup de jour is \"I don't give a shit.\"   One time we asked for straws and our server just chucked them at us. I've asked \"do you have any seats available?\" and been told \"I don't know, go look.\" We've had employees actually ask us to move, along with all of our stuff, to a different table (yes, really) to accommodate another group. I've been given dirty looks for asking for a slice of lemon in my water. All kinds of heartwarming interactions.  I haven't been to the other locations, but if you're a masochist that loves gourmet hot pockets this location is for you. Otherwise either get really drunk before you eat here, or just get it to-go.",

The meal was a good size and left me satisfied - although I kept thinking about Sweeny Todd while eating the lunch.  The one downside I found with the restaurant is that we arrived near opening and even though we were the only two in the restaurant, the music was so loud that we could barely hear each other talk. Otherwise, it was a pleasant accidental finding.",

The seating could be a bit more comfortable but the lighting and the hipster feel of the place is strangely calming. The menu is massive and surprisingly includes an entirely vegetarian section as well. I usually order the Mexican which comes with choice of vegetarian beef or regular. I decided to give vegetarian a try. I was certainly surprised. We ordered an appetizer of curried potatoes and baked beans and they were amazing. Finally we finished the meal with some beers and a desert of bread pudding. My one complaint is that they still don't have mushy peas. However, this is one of the few places that I insist on taking people new to the east valley.",

    "text": "All my life I thought the Irish were responsible for rainbows. Fantasies of red-bearded drunks dancing in shamrock fields with pots of gold had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childhood imagination. Then, I assumed the gays stole it. I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:   I became stranded in the Arizona desert when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.  My heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT (The Valley's original smooth jazz station). I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry canal? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board (i.e. I took my time). But, it was True. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.  All hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but, instead, found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the fries out of my Pinto. I used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirt-crusted windshield and began my trek across the arid valley.   As far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going.   After four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented for my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again.   Then, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I looked up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat pigeon deux. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace.   There was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert, and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into the abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood.   My next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, yellows, and blues! I had no idea where I was. I got so scared, I pooped a Skittle. Then, it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty.   I entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I expected leprechauns but encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this place was packed tighter than a carton of cigarettes. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up, and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back.   I sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The troll returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal dish before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.  It was gold, my friends.",

I remember when this place opened, being British I was on my way over there as fast as I could drive to get a fill of a much-missed pasty. Back then there was only one location, and it was tiny tiny tiny. It's so exciting to see this place grow and expand like it has.  I've tried their entire vegetarian menu and it is awesome, with so many options. Their veggie tikka masala is my favorite. Freakin' good sides, too. I love their garlic red potatoes. Great beer list, I love their recent addition of a rotating sour beer.  Usually get good service.  It's dark and a bit dingy, sometimes a bit loud, a atmosphere that I think works well for the establishment. There's plenty of outside seating with heat lamps, too.",

Uhh the hell do I want to cover up my nipples for I asked.  But noooo, these are like other reviewers have said, fancy hot pockets or giant dumpling...! I feel like everything at night in AZ is dark cause your windows are blacked out.  It gives a strange sensation at night...maybe it's just me.  But this place was pretty dark outside.   Greeted immediately upon entering...always a great first impression.  The interior was dark but decently lit.  Seating was primarily either the bar or long communal tables w/ benches. They play some cool metal/alt music that must be local or unsigned cause shazam wouldn't even pick that up. I went straight for the \"Premium\" section and got a Tandoori Chicken Pasty.  So the pasty itself is cut in half but it's a little difficult to eat like a hot pocket since it does fall apart, so you're better off with utensils.  But I'm a savage so I eat with my hands...take that pasty. Don't forget the fries!  Garlic!  With Jalapenos!  Fresh cut, some skin, and nice and crispy!",

    "text": "Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.  With restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.  If you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.  As soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.  The first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.  The Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.  Never able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.  The Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.  Cornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.",

    "text": "Most people measure their lives in important milestones - your first kiss, marriage, buying a home, the birth of a child, a big promotion. My own timeline merely has two distinct halves - the time before I ate at Cornish Pasty and the time after. Every memory, every experience, every relationship before I put that first savory bite of pasty in my mouth is merely a shade of everything afterwards.  What had I been doing with my life? Had I really tasted - really, truly tasted - food before? With the fervor of a religious convert I questioned everything I once thought I knew about the gastronomical experience. Some people might accuse me of hyperbole, but rest assured, they're either idiots or they've never actually eaten at Cornish Pasty.  I favor the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty. Think of an ideal Salmon dinner - complete with asparagus and rosemary potatoes - rolled up into a perfectly baked calzone-like dough crust and that's about what you're eating. Served with a mustard cream sauce, it's about the tastiest thing on which you'll ever put your filthy mouth.  If that weren't enough, there're about 100 other pasties that will make your taste buds weep for joy and then ask for more. But wait there's more, they have beer. More specifically, they have Guinness, which happens to be the perfect drinkable compliment to the pasty. Funny how that works, huh?  Enough talk, go get yourself to Cornish and have a life-changing experience. You can thank me later when I see you at the next Pasty Lovers Anonymous meeting.",

Sometimes it gets very busy, and the service can be slow, but the food is great.  If you do takeout, I would suggest getting the pasty once-baked (IE not cooked through).  They seem to batch prep, then finish cooking to order.. if you order once-baked, you can finish it off in your oven at your discretion, which can be better.  They tend to have British punk music about 3-4 days a week, never really payed attention to which days are which for music.  The atmosphere is okay, but I prefer the feel of the Scottsdale and Mesa locations, this one is just the closest to me.  Some of my favorites include the Potato Leak Soup (best I've had anywhere), and the following pasties... The Mexican (vegetarian version is good too), Lamb Vindaloo (it's a little spicy), and the Carne Adovada.... I've haven't had anything that was outright bad, but the Royal had way more onion than I care for, and I also didn't care for The Italian either which was way too close to a calzone, but the difference in a pasty crust wasn't my taste.  All said, pretty much everyone can find something to like here... fair warning, it is definitely not a carb friendly menu.. there are a few salads which are good, but it's not their mainstay.",

    "text": "We came in around 10pm on a Friday night for some food after a long 7 hr drive from New Mexico. The atmosphere is like a laid back pub. Their specialty are pasties which is kind of like a calzone + meat pie mixed into one. The menu explains the origin was from a place called Cornwell in the UK where the mothers/wives of miners would make these calzone meat pies for their men as their lunch when they're in the mining fields. There's a bar in the middle of the place and long community style tables where you can seat yourself in. Lots of young people here but it wasn't very crowded at all. Plenty of empty seats (which is a little strange for a Friday night for such a popular place with over 1000 yelp reviews).  We ordered the CHICKEN GREEK SALAD and the COTTAGE PIE PASTY. Both dishes were super delicious. The chicken in the salad was so moist and tender. The pasty was freshly made and deliciously cheesy. My fiance ordered the MONK SOUR BEER and he said it was really good as well. Not a bad meal after a long drive. The servers were attentive and have great sense of music (I think I found my playlist twin there - Mariah Carey Fantasy album, Beyonce check on it, Salt n Pepper)   If we are ever in the area again we would def stop by.",

    "text": "Been to this location about 10-12 time, also been to the Mesa one 15-20 times.   Came to this location to tonight for the first time in probably a year or two and the service was so awful I felt the need to share.  I hate to do it, because the food really is good and they have a solid beer selection and decent prices, but this was the worst service I can remember in 15+ years of eating out.  Service here has never been great, but this was the worst I have seen it and compared to most other places around Tempe that have excellent service it was pretty abysmal.  It was only slightly busy when we got there, most tables were taken but usually only 1-2 people at a 4-8 person table.  We had a mediums sized group, 7 or 8, and were able to find a table outside.  Took probably 15-20 minutes before anyone came by.  The table hadn't been cleared from the people before us so fortunately there was already a beer menu there. Server did not clear or wipe down the table at all, just asked for our order. The menu has like 5-6 rotating beers, asked our server what they were. Rather than just tell us what the 5-6 were, he made us ask individually (they are categorized, seasonal,IPA, etc.).  He ended up having to list off almost all of them anyway (we ordered 3-4 of them), and this was the first indication that things would be difficult.    Drinks and food came out relatively quick.  No real issues here but only half of us were eating.  Server was not terrible friendly or helpful.  Acted annoyed when answering questions or having to wait at all.  Everything was bare minimum effort and it wasn't because it was busy.  The big problem came when the check came.  First, they pretty much ran us off.  No one asked for the check, it was 9:30 at a place that closes at 12, and the place was basically empty, but he just dumped the check without saying anything.  Put everything on one check, when the group was clearly individuals, and then pretty much refused to split it (3 different people asked).   Told us we could tell him amounts and he would charge them.   He had charged us for one item we ordered but they didn't have, I let him know and he said he would remove.  We do the math, give him cards and checks, and he brings it back.  Tells us pretty rudely we are $6-$7 short.  5 of that was his failure to remove the $5 item he billed us for and had just said he would remove.  I let him know that I am not happy that a) he billed us for an item we didn't get in the first place and b) had to ask him twice to remove.  Rather than just apologize, he gives me grief \"Whoa Buddy, nothing to get mad about\".  At this point it had probably taken 15 minutes just to take care of the check and everyone at my table was pretty annoyed.  No one had ever had this much difficulty with a check and he honestly would have saved himself a lot of work and hassle had he just split it from the beginning and not fought us about it every step of the way.  Would generally recommend the Pasty, but will avoid this location like plague from now on.  Been coming here since the location was essentially a hallway, but will not anymore.  Head to the Mesa location instead.",

The meats and vegetables are fresh. Everything is made there. Perfect balance of ingredients and a great dough. The prep area behind the bar was great to watch. They have this down to a science. Everyone there was extremely nice. I saw the great reviews and decided to give it a shot. we were not disappointed. I love this place and I wish I lived here but I must fly home. If I get to visit Arizona again, I am defintely coming back here. As mentioned by others (thanks for the heads up) the gps will take you to the front of the block but you must drive down the side of the shopping center to find it on the cross street side (behind gas station).",

Yes, it's loud, sometimes it's dirty and sometimes the service is slow -- but I'll gladly put up with that for a taste of their pasties.

    "text": "I have lived down the street from this place for almost 5 years and have driven by hundreds of times and not given it a second thought.  I would have never considered this place (because of its location and I had never heard about it before) if it weren't for my fiance who had read a review and decided that we should give it a try.  To my amazement, this place is actually very cool!  I can't think of another place like it anywhere.  I have tried about 4 or 5 of their pasties and they have all been excellent.  I can only describe them as \"calzones filled with awesomeness\".  There has to be at least 15 different ones to choose from and they are all probably very tasty.  I cannot vouch for how healthy the things are, but they are very good.  At about 7ish dollars for a pasty they are a good value because they fill you up quite nicely.  With my meal, I usually get a salad (their dressing is amazing), the mashed peas and the roasted potatoes.  Sometimes I can't help but have one (or more) of their $3 Irish car bombs.  The salad, peas and potatoes are enough to share with 2-3 people, but keep the car bombs for yourself!  My only complaint about this place is the seating.  If you have a party of 3 or more you just shouldn't go there.  Not only is the place tiny, the tables are only for 2 people.  I think they only have 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate more.  There is a bar area and that is where I dine because the tables are usually filled.  Our new thing is to pre-order a few pasties.  They have them ready in just a few minutes, you pick them up, then pop them in your own oven.  This way we don't have to worry about seating.    Also, the service there is always friendly and fast, but always a bit frenzied because the place is always so busy.",

The soups were fantastic and a great value - honestly.   Our son had a pasty and curried potatoes.  A little on the salty side for my taste but the flavors were definitely there.   My husband and I shared a sausage salad and it was filled with veggies, cheeses and meat and very satisfying.  Loved the choices of beers and fresh iced teas as well.  We will be back.!",

    "text": "I first went to the Mesa location but had to try the original one.  I was surprised to see that both places are very slim and long.  This location is very small.  How small you ask?  Small enough that the staff constantly has to stop what they are doing to step aside and let other coworkers pass.  They were good at it though.  I love trying different types of food, and if it's a small local I am definitely in.  After checking out the rave reviews I gave them a shot.  I loved my pasty (Pass-tee) at both locations but I was denied the shepards pie one in Mesa because they were out.  I lucked out and finally got it at this location.  Boy was that good.  Ground lamb just has a better flavor note to it that beef doesn't bring to the table.  We also had a little half salad and some roasted potatoes.  Both were tasty and the roasted potatoes have a coat of fresh thyme on them and didn't have the fat and grease factor of fries.  In a place this small it is impossible to have bad service.  You can literally reach out and tap the staff if you feel neglected, that is how close they are.  Why do they get minus a star?  Because I am 6'5\" and had to assume a yoga pose that I am neither familiar with, nor comfortable performing due to the closeness of the stool to the bar.  I could have chosen a table, but I live to drink in the experience.    They have several beers to choose from, bonus points for not having American piss water on tap and having a little variety.  The place is very casual with some personality too.    A little tip for those like me who broke the record for most U-turns within a 100 yards.  The place faces west on the NE side of the intersection between University and Hardy.  A little tricky at night because the sign may not be on and the little shopping center address isn't lit up either.    Great food, friendly and social staff.  Unique little place.  What more do you want?",

I've been there several times in the past year, and I must profess that peering into the place for the very first time, I was quite skeptical.  Restaurant has a an interesting design, reminiscent of a large hall way.  Once you walk in there's a bar to the left and booths to the right and the place had a friendly neighborhood vibe to it.  The menu is decent with a variety old old world and new pasties.  The staff was friendly and order taking was prompt.  Although it did take longer than anticipated to actually get food, but I imagine that's because they don't have things pre-made.  The food was quite flavorful and the proportions were adequate.  The stuffing was moist and the outside crust was just the right amount of crispiness.  I usually try out the pasty's with lamb and none have disappointed me so far.  Overall, a great place to have beer and pasties, I will visit again to try out their more curious concoctions.",

It was a drive, but BOY was it worth it!   Love, love, love the unique vibe of this place. It reminded me of Bison Witches (near U of A in Tucson), but WAY better. The inside was small, but we made it before the lunch crowd so it's all good. We ordered the bangers n' mash and chicken tikka masala pasty. First of all, the pastry is awesome.. I'm pretty sure anything stuffed into that would blow your mind, but given they have a huge selection of great inserts that only increases the loveliness of the pastry. I'm not sure anything is better than a cold beer and one of these bad boys. They are so unique and extremely well done.   This place is a keeper for sure... I can't wait to go back and give some other varieties a whirl. Based on the reviews, I've got to sample some dessert as well... yay!",

And though I felt as if I were in love at the beginning, the relationship seemed to spiral downhill in the end.   -Oggie, the original pasty, with meat, potatoes, and gravy... was excellent, and set the stage for my obsession.  -Italian was pretty decent as well, something like a more homemade type of pizza hot-pocket: with pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, and stewed tomatoes, then served with a side of marinara sauce.  -Lovely Bit Salmon was excellent!  Salmon, potatoes, asparagus... delicious! -Lamb Vindaloo, Lamb in red curry and potatoes... was decent, though I probably wouldn't get it again.   -Peppered Steak = GROSS, disgusting, worst thing I've ever received in any food making establishment.  I actually think mine was bad or rotten, and would've complained, but I'd taken it to go and so I was stuck with it.  I took one bite, gagged, spit it out, and threw it away.  If it weren't for the rotten peppered steak I received, I was going to give a 5-star review, but after it I think I'm being very forgiving with giving 4-stars.  Everything else was pretty excellent, so I'll try to forgive the one absolutely disgusting pasty.",

    "text": "Words cannot begin to describe the glory that is this fine establishment. Never had bad service or a bad meal. These puff pastry stuffed bundles of heaven erupt with surgically precise flavor combinations that leave me speechless every single time.   My new favorite is the Lamb & Mint, a delicious combination of succulent and juicy lamb, perfectly sliced potatoes, rutabaga, and of course, the fresh mint sprigs make for a truly transcendental dining experience.   After tasting more than 3/4 of their menu, I have yet to taste a single thing that wasn't perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced, or perfectly paired with their exquisite red wine gravy. I could drink that delicious concoction by the gallon.   The vegetarian pasties are undeniably good as well, the Eggplant Parmesan is a worldly experience that I could eat any time, any day. It stuffs the best bits of the garden into a mozzarella, marinara and Parmesan wrapped envelope of goodness that has to be tasted to be appreciated.  The Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Cheese soup is out of this world, the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Mashed Potatoes with Cheese make all other mashed potato dishes taste like dehydrated flake garbage, and the desserts (if you can find any more room in your belly for awesome) are the food of gods. The PB&J Pasty or the Banoffee Pie make me want to live in this restaurant until the day I die.  The location is being renovated currently to expand into the adjacent building, which is a welcomed change as the intimate dining area admittedly cramped on busy days. Though it is a wondrous experience to watch the staff prepare their pasties mere feet from your seat, it will really do well to have a few more tables. Sit at the bar if at all possible for the best dining experience.  I wish I could give CPC 6 stars simply because the other places I've deemed worthy of 5 stars simply cannot compare. On top of all this, the unparalleled drinking specials, 32 oz steins, and $3 car bombs every day make this not only a wonderful place to eat, but a perfect spot to pickle the liver as well.",

My husband very much enjoyed his pasty as he loves cheese and bready foods, but I could've used some more freshness. The mustard sauce I ordered with my pasty was creamy but not right with my pasty so I switched with my husbands sweeter marinara to accompany my eggplant pasty. We sat outside and even though it was May they had the heaters on because it was chilly. Very considerate for us True Arizonans.

And, oh yeah, us, the regular \"normal\" folks.  We got seated at a long bench, and the first thing we were told is that they were out of multiple items. Argh! that's always disappointing.  Two of us got soft drinks (soda + root beer), and they were FLAT. As in nary a bubble to be seen flat.  We told the waitress, and it was about 10 minutes later with some fresh bubbly sodas.  Did I mention they were out of a ton of things? We eventually ended up with potato wedges (out of the fries), lamb pasty, thanksgiving pasty, leak + potato soup, and english toffee pudding. Why do establishments think it's cute to rename products which already have a perfectly acceptable name (I'm looking at you, starbucks)?   Before the food could come out, they seated a party of 7 LARGE individuals at our communal bench. We are a party of 4 normal to slender individuals, but the amount of human flesh pushed up to us was ridiculous.  There's personal space, and then there's hello, you are practically in my lap! Seriously, their party should have gotten a whole communal table to themselves because it was absurd.  Food came - it was hot, and everyone seemed happy. I had the toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. Really enjoyable, but it's hard to eat when your arms are squished by your side due to overflowing human flesh that's not yours, or your friend's. Sometimes I don't want to make new friends!  Noise level: loud. Hipsters: present.",

First thing I did was ask for a gallon of water. Our server was very obliging and made sure my cup did not go dry. He said, \"you either ran here or you're hungover.\" Well in fact sir, despite it being nearly 7 pm, I was extremely hungover. (thanks to Devil's Advocate)   I wasn't sure I could hold food down, but once I was delivered my portabella pasty it was no longer a question. It was going in my mouth. Whether or not it would last in stomach, I would wait to find out.  It turns out, a pasty is just what it takes to help out a hangover. Whatever that magical pocket it made of is just what I needed. No doubt the bucket of water helped, too.  Bonus, they have some pretty hearty options for when you're hungry/hungover/etc. and some healthy vegan and vegetarian options for when you're in the mood for something lighter. Oh, and $3 carbombs that I politely declined as I grimaced and grabbed my stomach.",

The pasty's are also amazing, I suggest that you share one unless you are feeding a college kid that loves leftovers, the portions are huge. Go NOW. I prefer the decor at the Tempe location, but the vibe at the Scottsdale location is rocking on a weekend night. Great food and great casual fun.",

These are HUGE so come hungry! Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal.  The place is pretty divey but in a really great way. I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon. Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.  They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it.   I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.  Highly recommend it if you are in the area.",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty serves up a British classic in a pub-like environment in a weird part of Tempe. The tables are long, the lighting is dim, and the pasties are heavy. And look, I'm not advocating you slap a constantly illuminating \"Open\" sign on the front of this restaurant, but its position on the side of a strip mall made it hard to find!   Cornish Pasty had a ton of vegetarian options. Most of them had Quorn fake meat. If you've ever looked hard enough, you'll find Quorn at your local Kroger, or definitely at a Whole Foods. Just substituting meat with Quorn works quite well.  If you're up for eating a $10 Hot-Pocket-on-steroids, go to Cornish Pasty Company.   The veggie BBQ Spicy Chicken pasty was fun to eat. The homemade BBQ sauce was tangy, and the jalapeno and red onion stood out. I also ended up ordering a cheese plate and bowl of broccoli soup. I ate the soup too quickly and burned my tongue. What a disaster. The cheese plate was fine. The flavors were strong - sharp and or stinky was the name of the game. The plate came with pieces of toast, which was a lot of bread. But hey, in this pub-like environment, bread can be a good thing.   If I end my health kick, I'll definitely swing back by and try a different pasty.",

If you haven't tried a True Cornish pasty, that alone is reason to visit this spot; I've never seen a wider selection. The pasty is TASTY, that's for damn sure. Be prepared to wait.

This is the 2nd time I've ordered the food to go during my lunch and my order has been completely wrong when I get it back to work.   Today I ordered a chicken ceasar salad. I was asked if I wanted it \"mixed\" together and I said, sure. So I get my order, get it back to my office and it's a salad in one box, dressing on the side...and a full, un-sliced chicken breast in another box. Okaaay....maybe \"mixed\" didn't mean what I thought it meant..oh well. So I pour the dressing on the salad and it's ranch, not ceasar. Not a huge deal..just not what I ordered. So then I go to cut up the chicken breast and it is definitely slathered in spaghetti sauce. So now I have a ranch salad and a spaghetti sauce covered chicken breast. Awkward.  Because my lunch hour was almost over and I was starving, I decided, fine..I'll just eat them separately and call it a meal. Both were awful. The chicken tasted like it had been reheated and the salad was wilted. This is a bummer because their food is good every time I eat there so it may just be a takeout issue. So for that reason, I recommend eating there - no takeout!",

I love anything pie crust and these pasties definitely hit the spot.  The minced lamb from the Shepard's pie was  cooked perfectly and not too gamey. The Oggie was a classic and a comfort food. Oven chips were like french fries cooked with minced garlic and jalepenos that weren't spicy at all.

It's like the best breakfast burrito you've every had because that buttery flaky pasty crust can't be beat. The Pilgrim on the other hand is like that delicious meal you make the day after Thanksgiving with all the leftovers. It has turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes. It's delicious by itself but with the wine gravy and cranberry sauce it's become out of this world! It's like what a chicken pot pie wishes it could be and you'll be thinking about that wine gravy sauce at Thanksgiving wishing you had some.   Lastly, for dessert, and no meal at Cornish Pasty Co. can be complete without it, the chocolate bread pudding. Now you may be saying \"But Connor, I've had bread pudding and I don't like it.\" That's fine. It's literally like no other bread pudding. For starters I'm fairly certain the \"bread\" they use is cake. Secondly it's not cooked into a complete mush or gel. The layers of delicious sweet cake are clearly evident when you get it. About four layers on each one typed with creme anglaise and ice cream. Each bite is incredible.",

    "text": "I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(  But nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.)   Soups: They offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.    Sides:  The garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.    The mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.    The broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had.   All their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.    What differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.  Overall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

It was impossible to pick a favorite and this will definitely be on my go-to list when in Tempe.

    "text": "FOOD: I don't know why Cornish Pasty is listed as British food. Most of the choices of pasties are not British at all. For those of you who don't know what a pasty is, it's basically a baked pastry case filled with your choice of ingredients. Very much resembles a pie. Pasties are the only item on the menu but there are a wide variety of flavors. I had the Oggy, and it was enjoyable mostly because it was different than most foods I eat for lunch or have even tried before (and it seemed the most British). The ingredients are not amazing, but overall it was a good lunch. Dip your pasty in ketchup so it isn't so dry.   PRICE: The pasties are kinda expensive for what you get. A pasty will run for about $8-9 without any sides. The pasties aren't very large, but will be enough for a lunch.   SERVICE: We were served by a nice girl, and the lunch went very smoothly.   ATMOSPHERE: Very thin dining area. Only one table can sit 3 people, the rest are bar stools and 2 person tables. Didn't really seem British with the metal rock playing in the kitchen either. Maybe if it was the Sex Pistols...  SKINNY: Cornish Pasty is great lunch spot at best, but doesn't offer anything that will blow your socks off. Interesting food with decent taste. I'll probably be going back.",

I had heard coworkers raving about this place, none of which live anywhere close to it so I figured it must be worth the drive, and I must say they were right!   The food itself was very good, there are tons of  pasties to choose from (it took me a while to remember it is pronounced \"pass-tee\" and not \"pace-tee\".......I'm sure a \"pace-tee\" can be found at a very different establishment nearby).  Anywhere from Sheppard's Pie, to Mexican, to BBQ, you name it.  I plan on trying a variety of them in the future!  The only downfall is it is VERY small.  Walking in I thought I was going down a hallway to the main seating area, but no.  That was it.  With the bar staring literally directly into the kitchen I didn't see anything gross or something that shouldn't be there, so that was good.  You also feel the heat of the kitchen, with only a few fans here and there to relieve you.  All in all a good \"something different\", and the prices are reasonable (about $6-$9, $9 being their \"premium\" selections).",

Each of these pasties is rightly proportioned for me for two meals. I have a Guinness or sometimes a Stella and I am as full as can be! The other half makes a great surprise for a good friend or lunch tomorrow, and they only cost about ten bucks.  My favorite thing on this menu is the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and this is coming from someone who always hated Shepherd's Pie as a kid! Inside of this delicious golden crust there is seasoned ground beef, browned onions, garlic mashed potatoes and what tastes like tilamook medium cheddar. These guys serve it up with a side of what they call \"red wine gravy\", but it tastes like a borderlaise to me -deep and beefy with plenty of thyme.   If I could eat anything everyday without ever getting fat, this place makes the short list!  *mwah* belissima!  Oh and I really liked the Carne Adovada Pasty with the sour cream on the side too!",

A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.  What is a pasty?  A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the \"handles\" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.  At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.  Pros * Good food * Originality * Portions * Customer service * Coat hooks at the bar  Cons * Small interior",

    "text": "I want to give the Cornish Pasty Company another star, but I can't quite do it...  The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.  I tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the \"premium\" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me.   Even that, I can write off to personal preference.  What really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself.   It's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back.   On the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made.   I don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses).   My worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the \"kitchen\" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...  I've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.  Maybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden...",

    "text": "Another night, another food adventure with my culinary partner in crime Julia. To preface this, I have been to the Cornish Pasty Co. Location on Mill ave. But the two have vastly different vibes and menus.   This location's menu is larger to match the larger space. The whole vibe of this restaurant is really relaxing and casual. The mood lighting really helps secure this. I was a little nervous at first since I didn't see any lights on outside but was instantly reassured after entering.   The staff here are quite friendly! Evident by the crowd they attract in addition to the recommendations they offer.  One funny observation was how the people sitting in the slightly elevated area all seemed to be on dates. How fitting.   Ambience is small potatoes in comparison to the food though. The pasties here are BRIMMING with flavor. As the cross sections of the food show, there is no room for air pockets. Each pasty is absolutely stuffed with your selected filling. As a bonus, they look gorgeous. The cross sections are super colorful and the part where the pasty is folded and pressed looks like it's been woven like a basket. One other thing I like about this place is how you're given a small cup of sauce or gravy to dip your pasty in. While my chicken pot pie pasty was no where near being dry, I loved having this extra gravy at my disposal. (You can never have too much gravy)   Overrall, I'm really excited about this place. I'll be sure to return with ample hunger. It can be very difficult to perfectly describe a flavor in its entirety so definitely try this place out for yourself.",

It was a very chill darkish vibe inside. I was dining solo so I picked a corner booth so I could check the place out while I dined. There were so many yummy options to pick from, it was hard to decide. I kind of wished I was with somebody, so we could have picked 2 different pasties and shared. I started off with a tasty beverage called Cornish 69. I might have had another if I wasn't driving. I ordered a Scotch Egg - Hardboiled egg wrapped in house pork with sage sausage and breadcrumb with a side of honey mustard, (tasty item #2) I then ordered The Royale with Cheese, it was one of their signature pasties. It was so hard deciding, but this one sounded interesting - Hamburger, french fries, grilled onion, bacon, button mushroom, and cheddar-Swiss blend. with 1000 island on the side. (Super tasty #3.) I only ate half of it.   The service was great, my waitress was really friendly. I recommended it to my friend that lives in Mesa, she has never been there!. She will probably be hooked!",

    "text": "A quick tip from another reviewer that I found helpful: PASTY rhymes with BLASTY. If you say \"PASTE-EE\", that's something else completely.   VEGAN REVIEW:  Wandering into Cornish Pasty from the bright AZ sun is a shock for the senses. I was momentarily blinded, because of how dark and dimly lit the restaurant was. After taking a minute for my eyes to adjust, I saw a couple empty tables and two waitstaff. I did not know this was a seat yourself kind of deal so my brother and I just stood at the doorway and waited for instruction. After about 5 minutes or so, a waitress told us to seat ourselves.   We came around 2pm, so many of the vegan pasties had been sold out and I was left with the choice between the vindaloo and the greek flavored ones. Upon the waitress' recommendation, I went with the vindaloo. My brother and I also ordered the Oven-baked Chips to share.   The Vindaloo Pasty was spicy and filling, but probably not something I would order again. The vindaloo filling did not offer much excitement in the flavor department, and eating THAT much vindaloo filling was kind of monotonous. I really wish I came earlier so I could have more vegan options to chose from but my mistake is your benefit!   The pastry part of the pasty was delicious! It was crunchy and had a wonderful pastry flavor that is hard to describe. If they sold a pasty full of the pastry, I would buy that in a heartbeat! When comparing  my pasty to my brother's, I could tell they didn't glaze mine, which is a comforting to see because they probably used an egg wash.   The oven-baked chips were 10/10.They were crunchy, crispy, and satisfying. You can't go wrong with fresh baked fries/chips!  Overall, I would visit again (but earlier) to try more vegan pasties.",

    "text": "So I first heard about this place when I moved out to Tempe in 2005 and I have to say that it has gotten better and better over the years.   Customer service has always been fantastic. The servers are usually younger, meaning they have always been between the ages of 18 to 40 years old from what I can tell.   I would actually say that they're right around the 20 to 30 year old range as this is a college town and they seem to be students. Now you would think that the younger people are immature but that's not the case.  The servers here check up on you at least once every 10 minutes which if you're used to dining out is pretty darn good.  I cannot remember a time where I had a bad meal, everything has always been delicious whether it's been an appetizer, a dessert or a main entree.  The food doesn't come out super fast but I've never waited more than 20 minutes for my food. That's why they have appetizers, they whipped those out within 5 to 10 minutes till you've got something to munch on before your main meal comes out.  Temperature wise, everything has been perfect, hot food comes out hot, cold dips come out cold, and everything stays nice and warm while you're eating.  Portion size is fantastic, I never feel like I am not getting my money's worth and even sometimes think I'm getting more than my money's worth.  So if you've never been there, I'd recommend going with a few people but save yourself some time, check out the menu in advance online so you guys can pick something to share. Maybe get two different pasties to share, cut them in half and split them with your friend.  That one that has chicken tikka masala and the other one that has chicken pot pie are really good. I never had any of the ones with pork but I hear they're good too.",

He helped us with out drink choices and was quick to put our orders in, which was great because we were really hungry.  Never had a pasty before and after having their's, I really don't know why! It was soooo good. Chunks of flavored beef accompanied by other ingredients and cheese all folded into a flaky pastry. So good! Talking about it is making me crave it even more. Too bad it's not closer to home, but I would make the drive for that pasty!  BTW, my boyfriend and I shared one pasty plate and added an extra side. The portion was more than enough for us both.

We tried three different kinds (the Oggie, the cottage pie, and the roast dinner), all of them seasoned to perfection and wrapped in the flakiest, most tender crust you can imagine. Our server shared the history of the joint with us, and service was fun, friendly and fast. Ambience is very pub-like, with lots of beer on offer and a nice, cozy, dark light.

    "text": "Quite frankly, my little sister doesn't understand why I write reviews on Yelp and it annoys her when I take pictures of food, but she has demanded that I give this place 5 stars and exclaimed, \"Look at the craftsmanship (of the pastry)...this is actually worth a photo!\" Sooo, yeah Cornish Pastry Co is a 4.5 in my book, easily rounded up to a 5.  While I would probably never find and/or try this restaurant on my own, I was highly intrigued by the excellent ratings and sheer number of reviews, so my sister and I dropped in just after 11:00 for lunch. I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!  The staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was \"effing delicious\" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy.   Literally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the \"Pilgrim\" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.  Definitely put this on your \"must see\" list of places to eat (for lunch)!",

Service wasn't anything to rave about, the facility was a bit dank, the seating outside was very uncomfortable, and the pasty I had was definitely nothing to run home and tell mom about. I'd understand the ratings if the prices per pasty weren't 9+ dollars, it'd be a cool place for college kids to get an ok sized hot pocket for a decent price, if they were more like 4 dollars.     I ordered the bangers and mash, steak/sausage and mashed potatoes wrapped in a crust. Not sure what expect from that, but it tasted just as it sounds. Again, I'll reiterate, not worth the price per pasty and definitely not a 4.5 star establishment nor a 4.5 star product.",

I switch between the vegetarian and the meaty versions fo their pasties and they are both delicious. So vegetarians, have no fear.   The drink specials are very nice as well. I like to get the enormous mug/pitcher of hard cider with my meal. SO GOOD!  I was very happy when they expanded. Sometimes it could be hard to get a table.

    "text": "This was my second time in Phoenix and since we were staying around the Tempe area I could not let the opportunity pass us by of not trying the most Yelped place in all of Phoenix! I've never had a pasty before so I didn't know what to expect but judging from the pictures I had a general idea of what it would taste it. We came in fairly late around 10pm and since I was going to run the Arizona 1/2 marathon the following morning I opted for one of the lighter dishes. They truly have a wide variety of what would go in your pasty from burger, to Alfredo to even Indian chicken tikka masala. I ordered the salmon one, which I did enjoy. The crust went perfectly with the well cooked salmon. There was also spinach with dill sauce and other things that I can't remember. If I was feeling adventurous and didn't have to worry about eating light I would of ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala since our server said that was one of her favorites. Although we had no room for dessert we ordered a banoffee pie to go. This was really tasty as well great combination of bananas, gram cracker, whipped cream and caramel. From that Yelp picture the caption says it's Banana Cream pie, don't make the mistake of asking for it because our server corrected us and told us it was Banofee pie, haha! The inside of this place is a hybrid between a dive and a pub because it was dark and had community style tables. Our server was pretty good I guess but nothing memorable in terms of outstanding customer service. I can see why this is a popular spot among ASU students. Most if not all the pasty selections are less than $10. Even half a pasty is filling so you could even share one. Pasty places aren't too popular so I would definitely recommend trying them out. I don't know when I'll be in Phoenix again, but if I'm in the Tempe area I will definitely stop by.",

I have a friend who loves this place, and I FINALLY made it in......so glad I did, I really didn't quite understand her description of what a pasty is, but, now I do! It's like the English version of an empanada, or like a gourmet hot pocket, haha! (ok, it really doesn't compare to a hot pocket, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to think of a good word picture!)  So, they have a million different filling options...it seems what is available on the menu might vary depending on what is fresh (LOVE food made to order that's FRESH!) The best part about this place is that they have VEGAN OPTIONS! woo hoo!!! I'm adding this place to my dairy-safe zone!   I had the vegan philly cheese steak pasty, it was very good! They really do make it fresh, mine was piping hot....for the \"steak\" they used mushrooms, and whatever kind of sauce they used for the \"cheese\" was quite savory. When you order your pasty, they give you some different sauce-on-the-side options (apparently you eat pasty with sauce?) Anyways, the marinara was really good and really complemented my pasty. (a beer would have worked really well with it too.... oh well, next time!)  My husband had the oggie and thoroughly enjoyed it was well. These things are big, by the way! If you have trouble filling up, you'll be really happy with this place! And if you don't, you'll have two meals for the day for only around 10 bucks! Not bad, right?!  Can't wait to come back here! Btw, this location is designed to look like inside a mine (read the menu for the background story on pasties) If you are claustrophobic, just sit towards the back, there is a nice big window back there. Otherwise, it is a bit dark and narrow in there, but still comfortable.",

A small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables, dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part, pretty good music.   My man and I ordered the Mexican Pasty and the Rosemary Chicken Pasty. They were unbelievable! SO GOOD. The Mexican Pasty was definitely the better of the two but I'd order both of them again any day. A little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy.

I was glad to see that the restaurant is doing well and remodeled their two locations with more locations coming soon.   The food at Cornish Pasty is impeccable. I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet.   The atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place. It's good for dates as well. $5 mid shelf and always $3 Irish Car bombs with lots of microbrews on draft? YES PLEASE.   The one thing I hate about Cornish Pasty, and the reason why I give it 2/5 is the SERVICE SUCKS. It must be a requirement to be a hipster with 5+ visible tattoos/piercings with a poor work effort. You even get a raise for having poor personal hygiene! I've been eating at Cornish Pasty for 5 years and have never received good service. Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.  If you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch.",

My friends that I've come here with agreed. The people who work here are so nice though, service was great. The pasties are very filling, you will leave stuffed (I couldn't finish a full pasty in one sitting).  I'll probably go back sometime to try one more pasty, maybe I was just expecting too much?",

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying that I love Cornish Pasty. So why the three star review? Well, their food is great, but the service is lousy. But let me back up a bit.  The very first time someone told me about \"The Pasty,\" as I refer to it, they described a pasty as \"a gourmet hot pocket.\" Let me tell you, that did not sound appealing. Despite how great they tried to make it sound, I could not get over the idea of a gourmet hot pocket. So I never checked it out until maybe a year ago when I was recommended by another friend, and figured I'd just give it a shot. It was delightful!  I've since been to The Pasty multiple times. It's the food that keeps me coming back. \"The Pilgrim\" is like Thanksgiving! I get it almost every time. It's a combination of turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and other wonderful flavors inside. Served with a side of cranberry sauce and a red wine gravy. I'm not too crazy about the gravy, but the cranberry sauce is awesome. I've also tried their Greek salad and black bean soup, which are just as wonderful. I love the bread that comes with the soup, and the dressing on the salad.  Although this location is closer to my house, I prefer going to the one on Guadalupe and Dobson because the service is slightly better (although both locations have poor service). And this location on University is way too dark and full of hipsters. But, I guess people dig that nowadays.  The main reason I'm writing this review is because of a trip I made to this location yesterday. I went with my boyfriend and we split all three items mentioned above. The Greek salad, black bean soup, and The Pilgrim. I was starving and was hoping our server would bring the soup and salad out first. I was thrilled when she came back after a couple minutes with the soup and was hoping the salad would come out shortly after. I love bread and when we ran out of bread (meaning after I scarfed all the bread down), I patiently waited for our server to come back around so I could ask for more bread, as well as the status on our salad. Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave. I'm used to the service being not so great, but this was just awful.  I thought maybe if I wrote a review about my last experience, they'd change the service up or hire better servers. Serving itself isn't very hard, I know, I've done it. And it doesn't take much effort to check up on a table. But the people who work at The Pasty just don't seem to care about anything. I guess that's just a hipster thing. (I would love to see their interview process, if there even is one. \"Do you know how to carry food?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, you're hired.\")  Anyway, I think I will be driving out of the way to go to the other Pasty instead. Since their servers are a little more attentive and I can actually see who I'm eating with, and what I'm eating for that matter. Hah, I can only imagine what that place looks like in the light. Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.  It's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on. If you're the type that doesn't like their server to stop by a lot, or you don't need any refills, then this place would be perfect for you.",

    "text": "What the...? A Cornish pasty place in Tempe, AZ? I've had a hankering for a pasty for quite some time and thought I'd have to wait until my next trip to the upper Midwest.   For starters, I like the menu here. Places that do one thing and do it well rate highly with me, and this place does pasties. There are about a dozen different kinds of pasties on the menu ranging from traditional (beef & potatoes or chicken pot pie) to unusual (salmon or Mexican), for example. The pasties are pre-made and warmed up to order and come with sauces. The red wine gravy I tried was very good. There are a few side dishes like chips, slaw, and beans, and some good looking desserts. (I can't say how they tasted; I had a second Strongbow for dessert.) They have several beers on draft and some bottles, too.   I thought the portion size was decent, but certainly not huge, and the prices fair, especially considering the next nearest pasty place is probably hundreds or thousands of miles away (aside from the CPC's other location, obviously). The pasty seemed authentic and pretty consistent with what I grew up with, but it was a bit salty and a bit dry, though the gravy helped. The flavors were good, though, and I enjoyed my Oggie (their main beef pasty).   The place is small, dark, and divey. There's a single row of tables mostly two-tops along one wall and about a dozen seats at the bar. Dark clothes, visible body piercings, and tattoos seem to be a prerequisite for employment at this place. I got the sense that this place turned into a heavy-metal bar in the evenings, though I could be wrong. I certainly enjoyed the Queen playing when I got there, and the two guys that waited on me at the bar were friendly, cool guys, and the service was efficient.   This is a place I'll visit whenever I'm in town. There's just nothing like it outside of England and the upper Midwest.",

    "text": "Had a British friend give us a couple of these to try a couple of months ago (via take out) and even heated up at home they had us with that delicious crust. The \"Oggie\" and the Italian were loaded with lots of meats and each had it's own sauce to go with. Decided to try the place for lunch on Friday and the wait was a bit long, especially considering we were the first ones in the door at 11am. It got crowded really fast and ended up waiting over 20 minutes for our Bannoffee Pie dessert (which was SO, SO sweet but very tasty, taken in small bitefuls). Either way, the Rueben Pasty was very good but I wouldn't order the chicken pesto one again. Too heavy on the mushrooms and artichokes, not enough meat. And something about these pasties beckons for MEAT! My husband and I are both Cornish Pasty Fans.",

The waitress too a bit too long to greet us, or even take our drink orders. Our food took even longer.   I split the Cottage Pasty with my friend, and my half was chilly in the middle. That aside, pasty is NOT my cup of tea.   I ordered the PB&J pasty for desert thinking maybe that would be more up my ally, but it was an odd mix of flavor, and still not my thing.   I didn't drink,  but I may consider coming back to check out their tap because it seemed impressive, but I will eat BEFORE I come.",

But with two separate doors and a very unique layout you must know it's a confusing restaurant. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, however that should be a focus for your employees, realizing that every guest should be greeted and either told where to sit or to seat themselves. I awkwardly walked into BOTH entries and neither time did a single employee say hello or even look my way.   Forgot to mention that prior to arriving I called in to check that there wasn't a cover for the fight (most bars were charging if they had the fight on) and the girl that answered was extremely rude (customer service is SO SIMPLE... it pains me when employees are so bad at basic people skills)! It was hard to convince my boyfriend to even give it a shot after speaking to her.   So after this and the lack of acknowledgment when I walked in I couldn't do it. I left, and very disappointed because I truly wanted to give this place a shot. Maybe I'll attempt another location one day.",

I'm partial to the \"Oggie\" and have it every time b/c it's so delicious! I ask for extra sauce too, love it   You can also buy pasties (as in 'past' not 'paste') to cook at home and they come out really well: just follow the instructions on the package they wrap for you. If you like beer there's a very comprehensive menu to satisfy all tastes. Vegetarians and vegans are also catered to, with special pasties full of veggies and other good things - I haven't tried those so can't judge, but from the standard of the ones I have had, I'd say those must be very good too. Have room for dessert?? okay then, I highly recommend the chocolate bread and butter pudding: yummy yum yum! of course the other desserts are great too, they even have a peanut butter and jelly pasty ....so bon appetit everyone and try not to get too addicted to these delicious concoctions....& if you don't already know why, read about the origins of the pasty while you wait for yours",

The dark, pub-meets-art-museum (complete with church pews for seats) look of the inside is kind of neat. The servers, completely stereotypical hipster in appearance, all seem nice enough. The menu and food are very different than anything I've seen before.  We ended up ordering the Meat and Cheese pasty and the Mexican. Both were good, and came with the appropriate sauces.  If I have one complaint, it's that pasties are pre-made. So if you don't like a certain ingredient or are allergic to something, there's no ordering the pasty of choice without it; you'll just have to find something without it in it. It also makes me wonder how long some of the less popular pasties have to sit and wait to be ordered.",

Music was on point and so was the service. Only complaint is that you would expect your pasty to come out much quicker than it had, thinking they just bake it for you but Im just being picky.  Would 100% recommend checking out this hole in the wall spot, not to mention im pretty sure I had an arabian goddess as a server who made the experience that much more fun. Great staff.

A group from my office was looking for better food options, rather than the usual burgers, subs or tacos; and we decided to come here.   I hold Cornish Pasty in a special place in my heart, if only for their Bangers & Mash pasty and Scottish Eggs. These are two items that take me back to my trips to the UK and Ireland. For a while, they even had Fuller's London Pride, a great bitter.   Today, we kept it light and ordered Scottish Eggs, Garlic Fries, Meatballs wrapped in Bacon and two different kinds of Pasties. I've included photos, as usual of our tasty lunch. All were delicious and within $10 or so each.   Expect to spend in the $15 - $25 range depending on ...       okay, wait for it...              ... how hungry and thirsty you are.   If you cannot make fun of yourself, who can you make fun of?

Many options for Cornish pasty's that it was difficult to decide but the waitress was friendly and helped lead me to the Cubano. The dough was a good consistency being thick but flaky and the flavors were all very good. The choice of the mustard cream sauce with it tick it up a notch. Also got some garlic fries that seemed a tad undercooked and not as crunchy as you would hope, but garlic flavor was good. Their ranch that was given to the table per request you could tell was homemade and was tasty!",

It was a weekday when my husband and I decided to go here- we got there around an hour before closing time (11pm) and there were a few people around , we weren't alone!  Upon reading reviews I was confused between the veggie rosemary chicken & veggie Asiago chicken pasty - the server recommended the latter.  The veggie Asiago spicy chicken pasty took pretty long to be served - wasn't spicy at all (not even mild) although it mentioned that it contains some chilies. Pretty bland for my taste buds with no flavor nor spice. The salsa served along was pretty good but I came in for the pasty and I was pretty disappointed. Hubby ordered beer and tandoori chicken wings and he loved it.  The server seemed to be having a rough day - asked for a straw for my glass of water and she decided to just dunk it in my glass in a rough way. While taking our plates and silverware after we were done she didn't hold the plate up straight and so the knife fell on my wrist hurting me (no apologies as such whatsoever). I didn't say anything but was definitely in no mood to tip for this service -sorry!",

The setting of the restaurant is my favorite it's very intimate but spacious and dim inside but if you choose to eat out side the patio in the back is perfect (if it isn't hot outside, I prefer it night time it's pretty romantic!) they have vegan and vegetarian options and they're pretty tasty as well. The customer service isn't the worst or the best. I think the waiters strategy is not let you enjoy your meal with you cane with or if you came alone. Rather than coming back every 5 mins and bothering you. However it can also be a negative if you need a refill. Anyway, this will always be one of the best spots in AZ!!!",

Sadly, I forgot about this place. We were in the area and I immediately thought of Cornish Pasty as my husband never been.  I definitely have great memory because I knew exactly where it was and I even went to the original main door, which is not the main door anymore! They expanded and not just expanded in just this restaurant but in different locations! Good for you, CP.   We took a seat and I ordered the Royale w/ cheese and hubby ordered the Spicy Asiago. The winner of the two was the Royale w/ Cheese. We also ordered two cocktails: hubby ordered the Moscow mule and I ordered the Cornish 69. Both were delicious and strong!!! One thing I highly appreciated is that it didn't take forever to bake our pasty. I remember it used to take at least 30-45 minutes but times have changed. It took about 15-20 min to get our order on our table.   We also decided to order the chocolate banana bread pudding and that was amazing!!! We didn't leave a bite on our plate. Total of our bill was around $56 and definitely worth it!!!",

I have been her emanh times with many different people and I have never heard anyone say the didn't like what they ordered.  I myself have had the Pesto chicken, Tikka masala, carne adovada, pilgrim, the Italian and all of them have been so tasty.

If you are interested in a relaxed, couch darker bar and a billiards or music experience, simply enter the side if Cornish known to the locals as The Beast. Certain Saturdays they have DJ's spinning it up and dancing. If you prefer less of a crowd and enjoy the old school diner experience, enter the center of the establishment where you can watch all the neat cooking of the kitchen. If you wish to meet up with several family and friends, you may enjoy the restaurant side where there is a bar and many tables. The tables are actually old church pews and create a unique ambiance. You may also enjoy the great AZ weather on the huge dog friendly patio.  The food will certainly not disappoint as they have pasty's of all types. The Pasty derived from the old mining days where a quick handy meal was easy to pick up and eat on the go. They also have tasty scotch eggs, baked wings, and a supper yummy mushroom walnut soup like no other.   If you have not been, feel free to check out the main location as it's a local gem or the also have a smaller location on Milk Avenue a mile away, a location in Chandler and a location in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I have a small history with pasties.  Having close friends that have been eating pasties since before Christ was born + hanging around said friends for 20 years = a small history with pasties.  I recently heard about this place on Yelp and every time I saw the name, I managed to over and over mis-read it as pastry.  My only defense is that I keep getting those forwards from folks that say it doesn't matter the order of the letters or even if all of them are there, you're brain will figure it out anyway.  i guess this time my brain figured wrong.  I digress...  It never occurred to me that this little known dish would have it's own establishment run in its honor.  Of course, once I finally clued in that it was pasty and not pastry and stopped acting like someone hopped up on pills, I naturally invited my pasty-lovin' friends to share in the experience.  They too were elated at the variety of pasty options and the fact this was the restaurant's purpose and specialty.  An added bonus is how f'n cheap it is.  Talk about a steal!  This place was packed!  Someone said to get there before 8 or 830, but it was 7 and overflowin'.  We managed to fit 5 of us in the awkward geometrical booth built for 3.  My two pasty veterans ordered the Oggie with ketchup since that's what they grew up on (minus the rutabaga).  They both liked it, but thought it was a little spicy due to the rutabaga and the fact they are both ridiculously sensitive to spice induced heat.  One of their sig others ordered a chicken pasty of some sort which he thought was just okay.  The other +1 and I had the shepherd's pie and there wasn't a crumb to be found on either plate.    Our waitress seemed completely unfriendly and a little standoff-ish.    She warmed up as the meal progressed, chatted with us, and she ended up being a great waitress.  One of the guys drinks diet coke like he's in some sort of contest.  After he downed the first one in record time and the waitress gave him a curious \"you need a refill already\" look, he warned her that he drinks a lot of diet coke and will be gettin' a lot of refills.  About two minutes later she came back with a pitcher so he could refill till his thirst is content.  Rock star move on her part.  We all left full, happy, and ready for the next phase of the evening.  I'll definitely be back again - maybe even for lunch since I work relatively close.  Just remember pasty, not pastry.  Yum!",

    "text": "These pasties are huge.  I mean they're bigger than Janet Jackson's breasts, and they are a steal at $7 or so.   So for value, quality and portions this is probably among your best bets in Tempe.  Punk rock and British pub grub are predictable and go together like PB&J, but Cornish Pasty is probably one of the more distinctive restaurants in the Valley for its niche of pasties in a quick service restaurant/diner setting.  My buddy was in town visiting and staying in Tempe wanted something unique for the area.  Given that he's used to Mexican, I opted for Cornish Pasty since it was nearby.  My friend couldn't finish his Oggie, with steak, potato, onion & rutabaga, but I couldn't resist polishing off the Cajun, blackened chicken breast, bacon, ham and swiss, served with an addictive side of chipotle sauce.  Spicy, but not overwhelming, but a bit on the greasy side as a warning.   The beer selection here is admirable, and had we not had to go back to work for the man that day, we would have certainly indulged.  Kronenbourg, Boddington's and Strongbow on tap, plus your expected hipster brews available by the bottle: Chimay and Rogue among them. The setting looks diner-ish with its long narrow strip mall set-up and open kitchen.  The atmosphere here is dark and weathered, but not dumpy.    The difficulty here is deciding on a pasty.  I could have easily gone for a meat and cheese, a Mexican pasty, or chicken tikka masala. Luckily, our server was very knowledgeable about the different pasties as we couldn't make up our mind, so his recommendations were well taken.",

My husband, who is a vegetarian always gets the vegetarian Shepard's Pie, which he loves.  The only two things that I think could be improved on is the inside of the restaurant is hot hot hot in the summer (better air conditioning). And, there could be more space (it's pretty cramped) for seating. Especially if there is more than 2 people in your party.",

    "text": "So before I moved to manage the new Sack's location on the west side, I had put in my time at the University & Hardy locale-- putting the Cornish Pasty Co. in ridiculously close proximity to myself and the other happy hour enthusiasts I happened to work with.  I still call over to that location to see if anyone there wants to give me an excuse to make the drive across town to meet for a Black Velvet. Hello, my name is Kara... and I'm an unabashed alcoholic.    So if you're following along, when we meet at Pasty Co, I'll already be full from a Sack's sandwich-- but as soon as I smell the baking dough & simmering spices, I'll be perusing the amply stocked vegetarian section of the menu and trying to decide between my three favorites-- The Mexican, The Rosemary Chicken, and the Tikka Masala.  And man alive, you can't drink at a place that's got such a great pub-style atmosphere and not have a great pub-style ale of which they have many.  That's my only complaint about this place-- I am compelled to eat hearty, drink hearty, and be merry until I about burst at the seams.    Managing a kitchen myself, I'm continuously amazed at what they can do with what little space they have!  Their seating area is only a bit longer and wider than their kitchen/prep area which is open to ogle and runs parallel to the grubbing area.  I enjoy sitting at the bar to spy on the process and trying to catch the staff eavesdropping on our loud bar banter.  I love when someone mashing potatoes chuckles at our drunken philosophy sessions.    Parting Tip: As mentioned in other reviews, and their claim to fame (rightly so)-- $3 Irish Car Bombs! (I've seen places charge $6!!!). Oh, and don't forget the Banoffee Pie for dessert.  They make their own whip cream!",

    "text": "This place is great! I took my mom before a play and we didn't experience any of the slow service that others mentioned. The food was unique and tasty. We each picked a pasty of our choice and then split the mushy peas and roasted potatoes. Top it off with tapped hard cider and I was in oral heaven.  There was far too much food for two people to eat in one sitting. These little sandwiches are deceptively filling. And the incredible number of options from which to select from is a little mind boggling. My suggestion would be just to settle on one and then figure on a few return visits to round out the list.  Tables are tight, so this is definitely not a place to take the whole posse, but that's not a huge down-grade. The music is fairly loud and as I mentioned, I was there early, so I can only imagine that it must get really loud when the place is full. Amazingly, mom commented that she liked the music (who knew she was a Green Day fan) and thought the atmosphere was charming (not how I would have described it, but clearly its a place that is even parent friendly). She already has picked out her next two choices for return visits...  A couple of things that really stood out to me: 1) You can get the Oggie (the basic pasty) partially cooked for a buck less than the menu price - then take it home and finish off the baking for that fresh out of the oven taste - very cool. 2) If you want desert, you have to order it first or share food, because there is no way to finish everything - sammie and side - and still want for more. 3) I've spent a lot of time in the mother land and don't remember the food every being this flavorful... but who really cares, this is good eats and did I mention the tapped hard cider?? (takes me to my happy place)!  This is a great unique food alternative for the down town Tempe area.",

I used to drive by the place all the time and my so at the time used to joke about Cornish Pastys being what Cornish strippers wore in non nude establishments.  All I can say is yum!  So one day, we took the plunge and stopped by after work.  It's dark but not dank.  Narrow but not crowded.  Tasty but not super fast.  Pasty may not be a good every day staple.  But it sure is tasty!  I have tried at least a half dozen menu items and none have steered me wrong but for the real \"flava\" I'm gonna recommend you stick with the more traditional stuff.  Otherwise you could just end up eating a calzone in disguise and seriously... who wants to eat a Cornish calzone?  The staff is nice, and friendly.  The vibe is decent and if you like meat (or veggies)  and potatoes (which may technically be a veggie but is class by itself you know) stuffed into delicous bread.  You will feel as if you have died and gone to heaven.  Do not be fooled by cheap imitations! This is not some gussied up hot pocket or some savory pop tart! This is the real deal!  After eating this you'll be ready to go into a coal mine and work for .. well no. That may be stretching the truth.  But the food is really good.  One time, I preordered from this place and got a bunch of parbaked Pasties for a Christmas Eve celebration.  They were a big hit.",

I had friends in town from San Fransisco and they surfed Yelp to find a good place to eat in Phoenix...Cornish Pasty Co sounded awesome...and totally lived up to our expectations.  So much so that after eating there one night, we returned the night after for another round!  We sampled quite a few things from their menu...the Royale with Cheese was badass, the Chicken Alfredo pleasant, the Cajun wickedly delicious and spicy...and don't forget the Pilgrim, which is like having Thanksgiving bundled up and delivered to you in a wonderfully delicious pasty package.  AND the portions are big enough that you can eat half and be full, so the goodness can be enjoyed as a heated up lunch the next day!  BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!  We couldn't resist dessert...  Night One:  Banoffee Pie.  Thick layer of graham cracker, wickedly thick layer of RICH caramel, a spattering of banana slices and then fresh whipped cream.  FREAKIN AWESOME.  AND IT GETS EVEN BETTER!!!!  Night Two:  Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty.  Imagine amazing pastry smothered in chunky peanut butter, drizzled with raspberry jelly and encasing bananas...now top that with some more pastry, more jelly and whipped cream...not the sickening sweet shit that comes in cans...fresh, cool awesomeness disguised as a white blob.  THIS is the amazing Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty...God's gift to man.    My advice...SEEK OUT CORNISH PASTY CO, ALL YE FOOD LOVERS!!!  You will NOT be disappointed.",

For the first time, I went to a Yelp-recommended place and was very disappointed.   First of all, the place is a dump. It's run down and kind of dirty...or at least gives off a dirty feel.I have seen the new Pasty that is over on Guadalupe in Mesa and the decor is very nice and it's clean.  This location is not wheelchair friendly at all and don't bother bringing more than 4 people unless you plan to stand at the bar.   I'm not sure if they were employees or just friends of the employees who were working there but there was a group of college age guys hanging around both behind the counter pouring their own drinks and lounging in front of the counter who were just filthy. They had dirty beards, dirty hair, dirty ripped up clothes....I had no idea that the new look in college guys was homeless-chic.    The food was....eh. My son had the meat and cheese pasty and I had the rueben. We shared our pasties and I was no more impressed with the meat and cheese than I was with the rueben. They weren't bad...they were just eh at best. You get the pasty...no side dish, no salad, no nothing. It's not really a value.   Our server was pleasant but nothing special. She served our food and kept our cokes filled. It was clear that the focus was on the bar. There were about 9 people just hanging out at the bar, which is fine, but the place isn't advertised as a bar. I had brought my 8 year old son and this place is really not kid friendly given the amount of attention given to the bar and the dirty patrons/employees who were hanging around.   If I do go back to Cornish Pasty it will likely be at the newer location which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1 because as a chain, it might be worth the 2nd visit. This one is just not worth the drive from the West Valley.",

My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.  Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.  We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait.",

Served to us piping hot! I ordered the Shepherds Pie and my husband ordered the A bit of Salmon. Dang good food. You owe it to yourself to eat here.",

    "text": "I'm a little late posting this but figured it was better late than never: the following happened a few months ago at the Tempe location.  Let me start off by saying I really, really like the food and they have a great selection of beer. The problem was with a waitress (she's blonde and thin) and how she treated me during our last and final visit to this restaurant. During our meal, I asked for a recommendation for a beer and gave her characteristics of beer I like as well as a recommendation for a pasty (I am really not picky but I cannot handle a lot of spice). I ordered both things she recommended and both turned out to be really not what I wanted at all. She recommended a beer that was really hoppy (when I had told her I like pilsners) and a spicy indian pasty that had a lot of curry (I'm sure it would be great for people who can handle spicy food--just a reminder that my issue with this restaurant is not with the food). During our meal she was really inattentive and it took around 30 minutes to get our check after we had asked for it. Because my boyfriend owed me money from earlier that day, I tipped lower (around 12%) and he tipped higher (around 30%) so our average tip on our meal was OVER 20%. We decided to leave a good tip because, despite the poor service, he really enjoyed his meal and we have had good experiences there before.   This is where things get really, really bad.   After leaving, I realized I left something on our table and approached our waitress and she gave it to me. After I thanked her, she said \"thanks for the (expletive) bad tip.\" I could not believe that she cursed at me for a tip that was over 20% and I was completely dumbfounded. I tried to find the manager but was unable to. It's a real shame that she ruined my experience with Cornish Pasty. All of my friends I was with as well as others have vowed to not go back there.",

They also have a LOT of non-traditional versions - like a chicken tikka.  And if you have no clue what a pasty is, but you like things like pot pies or even hot pockets, then give this place a go.  Good selection of beers, too.  Only thing to be aware of is that the place sort of looks closed (or even out of business) from the side entrance. Don't let that fool or deter you.",

I couldn't tell you because I've never been to Cornwall, but the pasties are good! If you've never had a pasty before, think empanadas, but with gravy, potatoes, lamb and peas and carrots inside.  They also have non-traditional pasties as well, with stuffings to make them resemble calzones and other foods.   I also really like the feel of the place, and how they've re-purposed several random items for decorations.   I'd really like to go back for drinks, as I feel like this would be a very laid-back, chill drinking atmosphere. And hipster heaven.  ...sometimes I wonder if I'm secretly a hipster, but then I think, what hipsters spend time wondering what kind of societal label they fit into? I think not. =)   Anywho - come here and try a pasty!",

Once inside seen the tattoo'ed waitresses, cooks, and bar tenders and knew this place was way above my expectations. Once I looked over the menu, which is extensive, had to decide on a meal. Went with the Shepard's Pie, made with minted ground lamb, veggies, and mashed potatoes, inside a pastry. Crazy I know, but absolutely fantastic. Staff was attentive and wanted to make sure my experience was great. Definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix.",

If anyone ventures to order the lamb and mint cornish pasty, please let me know if you find any meat in it!  Cos I couldn't find any in mine, just layers and layers of potatoes.  When I later told another ethnic dining buddy that I wasn't going back to Cornish Pasty, he (not eating with me, but went another time) said he ordered same and could not find the lamb in it, either.  He even told the manager, who said the \"cook musta made a mistake and forgot the lamb\".  See if they \"make a mistake\" on yours, too.  If you order another lamb pasty, LMK if you find the lamb in that one, too.  Eating these pasties is like \"mining\".  You don't see what you are getting till you get there with your mouth and fork, cos it visually hidden inside the pastry shell, so you keep digging and digging for the lamb.  Cost me $12 + for a \"potato pasty\" incl tax and tip.  BaaaahhhhhhD.",

I would highly recommend The Royal with Cheese. It's sort of their twist of a hamburger and fries stuffed in a calzone. The servers are very friendly and welcoming. Give this place a try, you are in for a pleasant surprise :)  The only issue I have is how long it take to make one once you have ordered. I would suggest to call ahead and order before eating there. I can understand the high price for just one pasty (around $9 per pastey not including a side) because they make each one by hand with fresh ingredients. The restaurant can work on the interior design as its a bit confusing, a mix between modern and old style English pub. Not a big fan of the church pews for seats because its hard to sit upright while eating. Its just awkward. If you can look past the odd decor, this place in not at all that bad.",

    "text": "The Excellent:  * They're open late!  * The pasties reheat really well @50% power, which was my primary goal. I bought 4 of them for a couple days of food in my hotel room while in town for work.   The Good * The Pasties: Lamb and Mint, Shepherds pie, italian, and Bangers and Mash. (Bangers and mash and italian were my favorite). I tried all 4 the night I bought them, when they were hot and fresh.  * They were a little dry (particularly the lamb ones), and it would have been nice to have some sauce INSIDE the pasty (maybe that makes them soggy though?) * The red wine sauce was really good, but was a little salty when I added enough to help with the dryness.   The Bad:  * None! Maybe the price is a little high? almost $10 seems a little high... but overall, I was happy.   I will happily go back when stocking up on a few days worth of food.",

Their oven chips and meatballs for appetizers are great as well! The pastys and made and baked fresh, so it can take a little time to get your food, but it is so worth the wait! Great prices on alcohol! And their desserts are SO good!! My fave is the chocolate bread pudding! A MUST everytime we good!      The only con is the staff/service ! Sometimes we get great servers that are very attentive and keep our drinks filled.. Other times it takes forever to see our server and to get the bill to pay!",

The bread crust is flaky and is stuffed with the pasty of your choosing (get the Asiago chicken!!). It comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. They have plenty of vegetarian options too if you're into that. My boyfriend enjoys the Pilgrim usually. The interior is dark and it was kinda difficult to find the entrance LOL. Pretty hipster joint and the food is top notch. I don't think you can possibly be disappointed.",

He mentioned pastys and all I could think of was pasties that women wear, anyways, I figured that if Yelpers gave it a great review it must be good. As you walk in it is kind of small, yet intimate. Are SUPER tiny waitress came over to take our order (She was super cute and small). My man ordered Cajun Chicken and I ordered the porky pasty with a Boddingtons. MMMM the food came out nice and warm.  I have to be honest that I liked the mans more than mine, his dish was a little spicy and it came with this chipotle style spread that pulled all the flavors together. The porky was good, it reminded me of pub food I have had in Edinburg, Scotland. It was gravy filled with lots of potatoes and meat.  Needless to say, I felt like I needed a nap afterwards; however, we decided to share the PB&J desert and it was GREAT!  Hands down the warmest best PB&J I have ever had.  We ended up paying around $30.00 for 2 bears dinner and desert, not bad.",

For those that don't know, a pasty is essentially a gourmet hot pocket.  They've got everything from standard meat and potatoes to a thanksgiving pasty with all the fixings, and plenty more.  The only pasty I didn't like was one with an ingredient I don't like, so I can't blame them.  I'm not even sure if they have other food, because I always get a pasty or two.  The beer selection is good, and the staff are great and very friendly.  The only downside is that this place is cramped and it can be hard to find a seat at times; there's only one table that can accommodate a crowd (+ the bar).  I hear the new location is better in this regard.",

(Then again, I'm a VERY picky eater) I had the mashers and bangers (mashed potato and pork stuffed into a greasy shell like that on a chicken pot pie except richer in fat). It was so and so. Kind of bland.  Second time around, I had the Italian style one with Salami and other yummy stuff in it. It was much better than the bland mashers and bangers.

There are only a handful of two seater tables and one long bar for seating. The restaurant fills up fast at dinner time and is a very tight fit to try to find an open seat among patrons and servers.   I ordered the Royale with Cheese. I would have liked to have it without mushrooms but the pasties are pre-made so no changes or substitutions can be made. Luckily the mushrooms were pretty big and easy to pick out. The pasty was delicious overall but the meat was a bit salty. The menu says it has french fries but they are really just potatoes cut like fries and not actually deep fried. I liked that. I was afraid the french fries would make it too greasy but they were a great addition.   My friend had a Cottage Pie Pasty. He said it was delicious and had no complaints. The red wine sauce complimented it well.  As I noted above, this place can get pretty busy and the servers run around like crazy serving and bussing tables. Service isn't superb but the food really makes up for it. Go here and you won't be disappointed.",

Red wine gravy.  I've never tasted a red wine gravy like it.  Compelling.  3.  Excellent beer and cider selection.  4.  Small place, great environment.",

I was pleasantly surprised that I had an entire page of unique and delicious options to choose from, and I know I will be returning soon to try more.  On another note, for any of you other vegetarians out there, I sat at the bar and could see the prep area where they cut the scrumptious pasties and prep them up to go out to customers, and to my satisfaction and delight, they were thoughtful enough to use a separate knife to cut my veggie pasty.

Great food, great beers amazing, personal service and I never wanted to go anywhere else for my afternoon beers and food. Recently, however, they have formed a new policy where there is no smoking on the patio area, fully outside, ventialted patio. I do not smoke, never have never will, but that idea is ridiculous. If you want to go to a non smoking family style restaurant, and there is an applebees in every town in america period. If you want a fun, hip atmosphere with the product and staff to back it up, you come to the Cornish pasty and if smoke bothers you, you stay indoors and thats that. Dear pasty: dont give in to these high horse, internet terrorists. Your fan base loves you and will stay True. Go corporate like.everyone else, fine, someone else will be more than willing to stay local and real.",

    "text": "Wow!  What a great little gem this place proved to be!  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided I had to give this place a try myself.  I admit, I was skeptical, I'm not a huge 'bread' or 'carb' fan, and I really don't like thick bread coated anything.  The pasties I've had in the past were similar to calzones in breadiness.  The pasties here, were something amazing and not at all what I've had in the past or imagined.  There menu was quite complete with heavier choices such as the meat and cheese to lighter chicken options and even some dessert pasties.  I opted for a chicken tikka masala pasty.  I was impressed by the presentation, a simple metal plate with the well portioned pasty cut in half and a side of tsaziki sauce.  The pasty crust was thin and delicate.  It was reminiscent of a hand worked Christmas pie dough that your Grandmother slaved over.  It wasn't too flaky or thick, and was the perfect match for the tasty filling.  The filling was delicious chunks of white meat chicken, little nibbles of potatoes and some peas in a deliciously balanced flavorful masala sauce.  The taste was quite authentic and the spice right on par with what I'd expect from an Indian food restaurant.  The tsaziki side sauce was cool and tangy, it was a good flavor contrast to the spicy meat pocket.  Since the  portion was rather large, I had more than half of my pasty left and took it to go.  I couldn't resist trying the PB&J pasty though.  I had one warmed and packaged to go.  I am SO glad I got the PB&J pasty as well.  It was so incredibly delicious!  Served with a side of fresh whipped cream, the PB&J was like an old childhood friend.  The warm crunchy peanut butter with the perfect banana slice and sweet strawberry jelly melted harmoniously in my mouth and still gave that satisfying 'coat your mouth' feeling that peanut butter does.  I will definitely return.",

    "text": "Now this here was a good recommendation and a pleasant surprise.  This location is literally a hole in the wall (or a small hallway through a wall).  You have a tiny path to walk between tables squished up against the wall and the bar.  Behind the bar is where the employees are cramped between the ovens and the cooking area/bar making stuff up for the customers and tripping over one another trying to maneuver around in that tiny space.  Now...don't be distressed.  It was actually a good experience.  I stopped in after work by myself, pulled up a seat at the bar.  A nice young lady from behind the bar came up to take my order.  I had never been here before, so had some questions.  Also, not being a huge onion fan (at least if they are really strong) I asked about the Porky, which aside from onion in the ingredient list, looked quite good.  She assured me the taste was mild and I would not notice.  I took her at her word and she was correct.  I did not notice and enjoyed my porky.  I got it along with a hard cider and garlic roasted \"chips\" (fries).    All in all...I was impressed by the good service, very knowledgeable staff, and in general, good food.  I think I might enjoy some of the other pasties(sp?) a bit more...but the Porky was good and quite flavorful.  The fries...the garlic they baked them with didn't really stick...so it was hit and miss...but overall...still good.  My only complaint really was by the time I got a beer, meal, and fries, it was nearly $20.  $7+ for the entree, $5 for the cider, and ~$3 for the fries.  Somewhat pricey.  But otherwise, good.  Top-notch service.",

I've heard about the meat pies of the CPC and finally made my way here.  I ordered The Oggie - The Traditional Pasty.  Not bad and very good to say, but I do recommend having it during the winter months.  It's pretty hot during the summer here in PHX if you haven't notice.  I would say the CPC is a seasonal restaurant and perfect during the cooler months.  Unless you need your meat pie fix!  Service was good overall and quick.

I started off with an Old Speckled Hen draft (great beer selection by the way) and a Greek salad. After much deliberation on what pastry to order, I finally settled on the Peppered Steak. The flavors of the pastry were rich and the side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce was extra tasty. It was a slam dunk meal!   The service was good and the atmosphere was very friendly. It's a great place to go with a group or take a date.   *Just a note - I went to the location on University that is tucked away in the back of a small strip mall.

I walked in to what looks like a blues club, very dark lit but unique with huge tables. I ordered the Original Pasty with the \"chips\" and it was so good. The service was awesome, and I'm going back with my family as soon as possible.",

The serving is enough for two meals, I'd highly advise asking for an extra sauce and a to-go box from the get go. The nitro-infused Guinness was an excellent pair with the pasty. Very laid-back atmosphere, with a dark red glow throughout the bar. Excellent choice for late night grub, I was not disappointed with this place whatsoever.",

On each of my last 3 visits it has taken over an hour to get my food. I am patient (especially when the food is so delicious) but the lack of concern from the servers is a bit much.   Last time I came in I ordered the tikka masala salad, now I know they may be busy, but over an hour for a salad is pretty poor service. The time before that I was served a cold pasty and you could tell it had sat for quite a while before making it to my table. Each time I pointed these things out and was met with blank stares or a passive \"we're working on it.\"  I think I will wait a couple of months before returning so they work out the kinks in their service. I still love the food, but I don't usually have 2 hours for lunch.",

The meat tasted like it was slow cooked for hours, the potatoes were soft but not soggy, and very well seasoned. The serving is also huge so if you have a big appetite, this will fill it. No sharing!! So far I've only gotten the pasty down, but I can't wait to try more off the menu.",

Let me tell you this place was jammed packed with all the tables filled and the noise level was loud, but you can still carry on a conversation. Okay enough about my time here lets get to the food. WOW is all I can say.  I felt like I was in a English pub.  Huge beer and wine list.  There are so many combination of pasties that's the hardest part was making a decision on which one I wanted.  My husband got the Greek chicken which he gobbled up and I got the Oggie.  The Oggie is fulled with steak, potatoes and other veggies, it was so delicious! I could only eat half.  the pasty crust was light and just melted in you mouth. Okay so here is the deal  My husband had 2 beers I had a cocktail, together we had two pasties and a side order of home made chips and our bill was $35.00 without  tip.  I have been to restaurants in the valley where $35.00 is just for the entree.  Yes Yes Yes we are going to go back.  I want to buy some $7.50 each to cook at home.",

The pasties are essentially gourmet hot pockets- a variety of different boiling hot meat/cheese/veg/sauce combinations presented to you in a warm flaky pastry. There are so many combinations that you will DEFINITELY find something you like, whether you're a meat-and-potatoes person, an anything-with-extra-cheese person, or a vegetarian.  The place itself is pretty small. It has a very unique character. It's pretty dark, and the staff is a friendly gang of textbook alternative, slightly goth hipsters.

I decided my friend and I would meet up here for drinks. On this particular night the resturant was packed, like usual. My friend and I saw two open seats at the bar and sat down. About 10 minutes later the waitress told us she would be with us shortly.   When we hit the 30 minute mark, I was nothing but enraged at the terrible customer service. I told my friend that I wanted to go somewhere else. As I was getting up and gathering my purse, the waitress comes over and had the balls to tell us she was just about to take our order. I informed her that we were leaving because she took 30 minutes to get to us. She should have just let us leave and not say anything. The fact she even acknowledged she was a crappy waitress enraged me more.  So why the three stars? When you're not waiting FOREVER for service and you actually get the opportunity to eat their pasties, your mind will be blown! The food is delicious! The only downside is you don't want to show up at ANY Cornish starving because it takes them a little while to cook them bad boys. I assure you that you won't regret the wait though!",

They have definitely grown since I first started coming in, the food stayed awesome and the venue just became much nicer!  Definitely a great place for lunch, afternoon drinks, dinner or a late night snack..  Great for pregame on the way to mill!",

Bring some friends and try this place out!",

It's a little place, not really good for groups or kiddos, but when you enter you truly fee the atmosphere shift, and guess what? Now you're part of the cool crowd. The food is so good! I love their mushy peas for a starter (although half of the time they are out) and then the Pilgrim to seal the deal. It's like a Thanksgiving party in your mouth any time of the year! All of their food is great, and this place is always busy it seems. Don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you like being in small spaces with a million loud drunks. Mid-afternoon is the best. The servers are usually pleasant, but some have a better-than-you hipster attitude. But hey, if you haven't been here yet, you're missing out on Tempe's best kept secret!",

What: Chicken Alfredo Pasty (Me) - Quite yummy, just a tad salty; Greek Chicken Pasty (Friend) - Pleasant, needed a bit more chicken; 2 Newcastle pints (tap) and 1 iced tea.  When: Friday night - early enough to grab the last table in the joint. Come 8:30, it was getting crowded. Good vibe.  Where: In a yucky strip mall. Like nearly everything else in this state.  Why: Because we're tired of the same old crappy take-out options. Because we wanted something fresh. Because it got good reviews on this site. Because it's an independent food joint with a bit of authentic culture to boot. (They've got Pavlova and Banoffee Pie! Holy effin-A!)  How: awesome was it? Quite. Nice atmosphere, see all positives noted in other reviews. Little things detracted from a five-star giving. However, I will be back. And not for a meaty pasty next time. For one of their delish-sounding desserts. Check out the menu at their website. Yuh-hum!",

I would imagine you would really have to like your co-workers here...working so closely in a small walkway of a kitchen.  The Pasty's are simply amazing, and there is one for everyone. I had the cheese steak..and it was spectacular!  This is a must go if you are in tempe!! The staff is amazing as well! Best service award for sure!  And with 6 people and 4 alcoholic beverages our bill was 83 dollars.... Almost unheard of!!  And finally ontop of all that.....they deliver to my house....yes they do...whatever Pasty I am in the mood for will be delivered right to my doorstep.  I think I am in love...",

(Call ahead if you're vegan so they can make your pasty up fresh w/out the butter.)  The taste...well, to die for.  I've had both the meat and the veg pasties and I haven't found a bad one yet.  Usually I can only eat one pasty...but if you starve up for a bit beforehand and have enough room, the desserts are awesome too.    The ambiance of this place rocks!  Black and silver, British-pub nostalgia is the theme, and you'll find that the waiters are cool, hip people and the staff, busy busy busy right in front of you cooking up the next batch of pasties. So, if you come alone, no worries...prepare to be entertained by the huge staff working in the kitchen (which is right across the bar from you).  Alone, with friends or even w/the kids, there's something for everyone here...there's even a yummy peanut butter and jelly pasty for those picky kids (or discerning adults ready for dessert)!!",

Don't bring your date for an intimate meal, especially if s/he's a bit on the hard of hearing side.   Thus far, I have tried both the Chicken Pot Pie pasty and the Cottage Pie pasty (the ground beef version of Shepherd's Pie). The Chicken Pot Pie pasty was just alright, but the Cottage Pie version was pretty darned awesome... Frankly, I was a little afraid of the \"ground minted lamb\" in the Shepherd's Pie, but maybe I'll try it next time, after drinking a cider to start out with. Did I mention the Strongbow Cider is worth a sip, or two, or three? (I like the fact that they have 3 sizes of Draft Beers, so that I don't have to special request a small glass...)",

Sorry if I grossed anyone out with that! Then to top it off, it was almost impossible to find, because it was so dark!   The place is long and skinny, and when you sit at the bar you get to watch people make the calzones (for lack of a better word) which is fun! It was kind of weird at first to have a conversation, but you get comfortable!  We decided to order 2 and share, so we could try more variety. We got a meat and cheese, which was served with a red wine sauce. Maybe because I am not a fan of red wine I didn't like the sauce!?!? But the pastry was so tasty! The meat was very flavorful and the cheese was gooey and yummy!   We also ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, wow was this spicy! Don't get me wrong I can handle spice! And I would say any more and it would be too much. The Sauce that came with it was necessary to cool off your mouth, and it helped that it was very tasty and refreshing!   I am looking forward to going back and trying the many different pastries they have.  But please don't let me forget to mention dessert aka creamy heavenly goodness, that is the peanut butter and jelly pastry. Fresh hot out of the oven with jelly sauce....oh my! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! When you go, and you should, don't forget dessert!",

Almost all of my friends give me the \"Duh\" face when I recommend we go eat at the Cornish Pasty.  \"What's a cornish pasty?\"  If I had a nickel for each time I heard that question asked, I'd have enough money to... I dunno, I'd at least have enough money to buy a 40 of Mickey's.  Or a can of Sparks.  There are so many different pasties you can choose.  Everything from Mexican to Greek to traditional American fare to the classic bangers and mash British faves.  And they're all good.  A lot of their better ingredients are homemade.  Each pasty has love baked right into its flaky crust.  I don't each there as much as I used to, mostly because I sort of exhausted myself, but I love bringing friends so I can relive my experience of the first time I went there.  Everyone else has pretty much already said it, but this is absolutely one of the best places to go eat.  If you've never been, you should really go.  The food is great, the beer is great and the whole atmosphere is so damn jolly you can't help but, at the very least, enjoy yourself with friends for the night.  Quite legitimately, this is about as good as it gets.",

And, once I ate their if I found out they went without me (after I had gone back to Cali) I would get so upset!  The location and exterior is very unassuming, actually you might miss it if you didn't know what you were looking for. It's tucked between a discount bread store and an Italian place in a slightly run down little strip mall. Initially, when you walk in it doesn't get much better... Its a hallway basically with about 8 tables that seat 2, 2 tables that seat four and a table all the way in the back that will seat 6-8. They also have about 14 seats at the bar. It's dark and in the summer it's WaRm too.   But, once you grab a table (it can take time on a Fri or Sat night) you are in for some good eats.   I love The Porky, Bangers & Mash & Carne Adovada. BF loves the Lamb & Mint. Friends of ours typically go for The Cottage Pie, Royale with Cheese or the Greek Chicken. Typically we stay with the \"traditional pasties\", but I recently tried the Carne Adovada (considered a premium pasty) and it rocks. So, BASICALLY we've never been disappointed.   And the red wine gravy that they serve on the side... Yeah, I could drink it (you will want to too).   And while there are a TON of pastys to choose from... at least once you have to order their pasta salad (order it w/ chicken). Spinach, bow tie pasta, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, onions, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and chicken tossed in a yummy pesto vinaigrette.  This is a spot that we always hit early on a Sat or Sun... rarely are we interested in braving the Fri night crowd... And, don't go with more than 4 people unless you want to sit at the bar.  Hard Cider and a pasty... my perfect Sunday afternoon.  *I was torn on giving the CPC 4 or 5 stars because of their ti-ny seating capacity... but it adds to the character of the place.",

I had never tasted pasties before until meeting my girlfriend and had doubts as to the potential quality of \"British\" food but I was truly blown away and have always left happy and never dissatisfied with my meal. It's hard to not stick to your favorites (the pesto chicken) I've personally also enjoyed the Shepherd's pie and chicken Alfredo as well. They also have a decent list of import beers which caps off the experience.  Meal aside though, in terms of the complete experience, meal, atmosphere, waiters,etc, that is were it loses it's one star. First off the location isn't very big...and they only have one location (this is a positive...but at the same time, just like Pita Jungle, with it's many locations and consistent quality, I would love to see another one arrive and I know this is the case soon). Secondly, and it's nearly impossible to avoid due to the size of the restaurant and the proximity to the kitchen, the place can get a bit hot and stuffy. But otherwise, whether a resident or a visitor wanting to try a \"recommended\" place, I would put my money on Cornish Pasty for a very delicious and filling meal.",

I really liked the dill sauce in the salmon, and the cranberry on the Pilgrim. I had the leek/potato/stilton soup as well, which was creamy and delicious as well.

I had the Shepard's Pie which was filled with meat, peas, carrots, and potatoes all covered in cheese and then stuffed in a flaky crust. They have many different kinds (about 25) so I guess I need to go back 24 more times or so.  They also have really a really good beer selection but I would rather drink all day at a place like Casey's Moore's and then stumble down here for the food.  Minus one star for not being around when I went to ASU and lived just down the street from this place, I could have biked home from the bars with a pasty in my hand.",

My personal favorite pasties are the Lamb and Mint, and the vegetarian Balsamic Portabello. The desserts I've tried(caramel apple pasty and strawberry pavlova) are also good.  The service at this place is always good and friendly. Yes, the location is small, but they have a larger location out in Mesa.",

    "text": "This place is one of my favorite restaurants.  Local restaurant  with delicious food.  For those who don't know, a pasty is basically a gourmet Hot Pocket.  The vegetarian friendly menu consists of a lot of pasties and a few salads, all under $10 and very filling.  They even have dessert pasties.  I've been here many times, and the only dud I've ever had was a very dry Chicken Alfredo.  The Cajun Chicken has trumped the Balsamic Portabello as my favorite.  My main gripe with this place is that it is very small.  There are only 2 or 3 tables that seat more than 2, not counting the bar counter.  There is usually a wait for dinners on Friday and Saturday.  I'm just glad I live close enough to do take out on those nights since they don't deliver.  My friends love the 32oz Guiness served in mini-pitchers for less than $9.",

My friend told me how good the food was here.  I being a foodie deiced to come and check it out. I ordered a beer, chips, shepherds pie, the greek and the apple desert. Everything I ate was amazing. It was well priced. I thought it was going to be more expensive but I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came out. Everything was $35 and I still have plenty of leftovers for another meal. The manager on site walked around to every table asking was everything ok? Did you enjoy the food? I find it to be a great quality when the management and staff truly care about you experience. Such great customer service here, I highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't done so already. I am positive you will have the same experience as I did, if not better.",

First off, the people who work there are really friendly and helpful. I think the guys name was Justin. Anyway, since I never had a pasty before, I required some direction and the menu has just about every kind of great filling you can think of to put in your pasty. I settled on the cheesesteak pasty. Since I didn't know what kind of sauce to order with it, Justin brought me three different ones. Red wine gravy, peppercorn sauce and some mustard cream sauce.  As it turned out, they were all great but the peppercorn was my favorite. I gotta tell you, the pasty was great. though I have no previous pasty experience, I can say that this pasty was terrific, the service was great and I will be going back.",

I typically call in my order and by the time I arrive (10-15 mins.) it is all ready for me to take home. Oddly, I usually do this on days when I'm hurting from a terrible hangover. Their menu, which is available online, has so many options and they all seem freaking incredible. However, when I'm hungover I usually want something very filling and comforting. So the very first pasty I called in was a shepherd's pie, then I'm asked if I want lamb (a True shepherd's pie) or beef (a cottage pie). Lamb, of course! It was so delicious it's the only one I've ever gotten. I just can't seem to bring myself to deviate and that's not really like me, especially when everyone raves about all the others. Someday. I'll surely be going back, maybe one day I'll actually eat there and enjoy the ambiance and maybe, just maybe I'll try something new. This place rocks! The service is great and they're all so friendly!",

I have since been back many times and the food is good and the service is very warm and welcoming. The idea of the Cornish Pasty lends itself to a diverse palate and the desserts, the beer selection, even the coffee here is very good. There are few cafes where you can go by yourself and feel comfortable sitting alone even when you are surrounded by couples on date night and rowdy college students and this is one of those places. There are many pasties to chose from and my favorite is The Cajun with my second choice being A Bit of Salmon. I have yet to try them all but The Mexican is next on the list. My favorite dessert is the Carmel Apple Pasty with Vanilla Ice Cream which is very good. I can be alone with my thoughts here or talk movies with the staff while they prepare, clean, and socialize with each other behind the long narrow bar. It is small and there is often a line but the solo diner can easily find a spot at the bar and I have never had a long wait.",

Anyway, the only complaint I have isn't really a complaint at all - it's more like. Nice surprise.   So, they actually have quite bit more of a food offering outside of the menu that's displayed on Yelp.  Not sure if that's a \"Yelp\" issue or maybe a technical upload mishap from the establishment but...and again, this is MOT and issue, but they have a whole slew of additional appetizer options as well - like this sick delicious curry bean dip - amazing.  Sort of like beans meet curry meet humus - yum!    I went with the Oggie, since in a Michigan native.  And, having eaten my fill of pasties (trust me, I've eaten a LOT of pasties), I consider myself an expert. These pasties in my humble opinion are as good as my sisters' - just don't tell her I said that.   Like many others on here, they're correct. The atmosphere is great - service is more than excellent and he food just rocks.  If you don't like this place - I really don't know what else to tell you.  Even their \"vegan\" pasties are good.  Although I'm bett'en there's still lard in the pie crust... :D. So there you Vegans!!!  Na na na. Just kidding.   Enjoy - it's a 5 plus-plus fo-Shizzel.",

The food was rib-sticking food - like a coal miner would eat! (That is their theme - coal mining). Our server, Brandon, made some terrific recommendations and was efficient.

They have some amazing appetizers: the bacon wrapped meatballs are fantastic. They were the hit of our entire family.  The pasties were incredible we have multiple but the Mexican and the Chicken Pot Pie were the favs. We also tried the salads with Tikka chicken that was solid.   The place is casual and open late. Good music and plenty of room for bigger parties. We'll definitely be back here again next time we're in town.  I only wish they had one of these in San Diego! ;-)",

The soup was so flavorful and loaded with the veggies and the lovely soft bread and butter accompanying it would have certainly been enough for my dinner.....but no, I had to order a spicy chicken pasty also, too much for one gal to eat!  My authentic English colonial boyfriend enjoyed the lamb vindaloo pasty.  Nice and spicy!  We will be back the next time in Phoenix.",

    "text": "A great way to hit 300 reviews!   We had heard only good things about this place, both on Yelp and from friends and co-workers that have been. We headed in and the black out curtains immediately made it feel like nighttime inside. After picking a seat at the bar we took a look at the menu and debated on the options.   I opted for the Shepherd's Pie (Cottage Pie) Pasty and he went for the The Oggie. We then decided to share a side of \"chips\" (i.e. fries). The best part of sitting at any restaurant bar, is getting to see the workers do what they do. This place was even better for that idea since you could not only watch bartenders mixing up drinks, but the kitchen was front and center, so we were able to watch our food be made from start to finish!  The food took a bit to come out, but each order is made fresh and the fries are baked, not fried, so it's worth waiting for. Both our Pasties were delicious and very filling! The fries were cooked perfectly, and it was nice to step away from the fried food world and still enjoy a great stuffed pasty and fries.  The staff was very friendly and checked in on us regularly. We were so stuffed we didn't get dessert this go-round, however, it isn't out of the cards for the next visit!  Overall: A A quirky \"hole-in-the-wall\" bar with amazing food, fun staff, and great ambiance. Go!",

    "text": "Never thought I would be walking into a place with the word \"pasty\" as part of the name! Because one of the times I've been, we discussed/showed a nonnative English speaker the differences between pah-sty and pay-sty. Quite the conversation that evening, and I will never think of them again the same way.  I never knew that this place was a Must-Do until looking it up afterwards! The only thing the guys in my volleyball group said we were \"going to a place nearby [to Mitchell Park] for beer and food\". I love beer. And I love food after a few hours of sand volleyball. Score points for them getting me to Cornish Pasty Co!  We walk in and I'm definitely taken back to some hipster dives and British pubs I've been to in my time. While it was a little too dark for my liking, I get the hipster feel they're going for since that's the majority of people I've seen there. The service has been wonderful - cheerful gals who consistently ask if they can help in any way and know their stuff.   The beer list is small, and I like it! Within two weeks of my two visits, the beer menu had changed. There were a few breweries that hadn't changed, but the styles had. ALL THAT is what I call quality. Even better, the two servers were knowledgeable about the entire beer menu each time. They must do extreme taste-testing before the beer menu goes out [which I'd be totally jealous of!]. The food is even better - my fellow volleyballers love the soups, and we all agree on the pasty's. I love love the Bangers & Mash Pasty, and the Oggie looks delicious too. You just can't go wrong with them... unless they are sold out for the day. My next goal is to try their desserts which sound very appealing!",

So, I finally made my way to Cornish Pasty Company today after months and months of seeing the reviews roll in, and now I know why there are so many CP fans.  This place is great!  It's kind of a British pub atmosphere inside. Really laid back and comfortable - and mostly men dining... my party balanced it out as the three of us brought some estrogen inside!  The menu consists of a diverse variety of pasties, which are like calzones or English hot pockets.  They are all homemade with fresh ingredients, and many of them sound super yummy; i had a hard time deciding what to order...   I went with the chicken greek pasty while my dining companions went with the carne adovada and the spicy asiago chicken.  I think we were all pretty happy with our respective orders.  I noticed they have large salads on the menu also.  I'm thinking perhaps next visit I'll try a salad - maybe even go with someone who has similar tastes to me and split a pasty and a salad?  Any takers?  Either way, I'll be back - it may have been my first Cornish Pasty experience but it will not be my last!",

In fact, just the mere thought has me drooling and thinking of making a trip there.    I have been to both locations - this one and the one out in Mesa.  Although the one is Mesa is closer to my house and the food the same quality, I prefer the ambiance of this one better so my husband and I always try to stop by when in the area.    I'l admit I'm not very adventurous when eating new things at times.  I find a favorite and stick to it.  I have tried about 5 different pasties but my favorites I always come back to are the Oggie and Chicken Pot Pie.  Their soups are also wonderful.  The potato leek is very hearty and filling but the Mushroom, Walnut and Spinach was a wonderful surprise.  I would never have tried it because it seemed and odd mix of flavors but I saw an episode of \"Check Please AZ\" where this soup was raved about so I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  The complexity of flavors was out of this world.  A huge beer and a warm pasty, the casual atmosphere and aroma of the mouth watering red wine gravy all blend into a wonderful dining experience.  For the value and the quality this is a \"must try\" for everyone.",

UPDATE: After coming in nearly every week for months, I've made a couple new observations. I really wish they would work on their customer service. There is only a couple of waitresses that actually do their job. The rest seem to disappear indefinitely. Food is still amazing and well drinks have good amount of liquor.",

I usually get a pasty, some oven chips, and a Strongbow (which they almost always have on tap). This has been a favorite place for my group of friends to meet and catch up at for years now.

    "text": "If you ever had 3 days of meetings in different cities each day, spending more time at the airports than the hotels, you will discover that you can end up eating non stop because food is available everywhere...at the meetings, at the hotel, in your luggage.... and you  eat sometimes just to pass the time.   At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows  Dinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:  \"How about pastys for dinner?\"  He went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....  \"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"  \"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"  Still thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.  \"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.  We arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.     It is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.    Sitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.  I wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is Atlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes.   WHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.  My buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.  If ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.  After dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...",

    "text": "As a Brit a long way from home, I couldn't believe it when my friend took me to this little gem hidden away in a random Tempe stripmall. The dark grungy decor and Hipster clientele seemed straight out of Capitol Hill in Seattle!   I had the original Cornish pasty, like what pasties are in the UK. Though the pasty menu is extensive and creative with lots of veggie options too.  It was fantastic!  Succulent steak chunks and vegetables wrapped up in the delicious pastry crust. Very authentic!  Also had the mushy peas, True British chippy style.   For dessert I had to have the sticky toffee pudding as that's my all time favourite 'afters' from home. It arrived in its own black cauldron with a side of creme anglaise. Absolutely amazing! The sweet gooey toffee inside was perfectly warm and runny. My friend and I quickly inhaled the whole thing in a few spoonfuls.  Overall it was a great dining experience here. Lots of beer choices too. I shall be back!",

Of course I didn't get that, but my coworker did and it made me jealous!  I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken and although it was really good, it was nothing like the taste I had of the salmon pasty.  I will have to get that salmony creamy goodness next time.   These things will fill you up.  I felt like I needed a nap after my pasty lunch!",

I returned the very next night and sat in the very same chair at the bar and didn't just get bad service, I got no service.  I sat there for 20 minutes (yes 20 minutes at the bar AND they weren't busy!) without as much as a \"how d'ya do\" from the server despite him seeing me.  At that point I decided to cut my losses and leave with an empty stomach.  I'm just glad I could justify giving these guys at least 2 stars because of the stellar service I received the first night.",

    "text": "OK OK, so I gave it another try and you know what, I'm convinced that it is actually pretty damn good!   The key is....order your pasty well done or extra hot or whatever you want to say. I even heard another guest sitting behind me ask for theirs cooked extra hot!   So this time I ordered the Pilgrim....Turkey, Stuffing,Sweet Potatoes and grilled onions served with a side of their Bomb-Diggety Red Wine Gravy and cranberry sauce. (see pics) LOVED IT!!!!  I'm craving it!  I ended up splitting with Nathan S. and also got to try his Chicken Tikka Masala (see pics) which tasted very much like real authentic CTM.....although I did feel it was a bit spicy for my taste I liked it and the yogurt sauce helped cut the spice.   So that being said I ordered 2 Pasty's to go to bake at home and let me tell you that is the ticket! The hotter they are the better they taste!!  The Fam agreed they were a hit and once again Super Mom saves the day!   P.S.  Strangely enough there was no mention of our dessert???? NATHAN? I'll let you take care of that. I guess you didn't like it?",

We waited 10 minutes at our table before someone came to get our drink order. Once we got our drinks, we told her we needed just a few more minutes before ordering our food, but she didn't come back to take our order for almost another 15-20 minutes. Perhaps it was just out server, so I don't want to assume they are all like that. HOWEVER,  their pastys don't even compare to the other location first and foremost. Their vegan pastys are not as well made either and fall apart every time I have had them from this location. They were also out of mushy peas, didn't offer us more water or beer when we were all clearly out of drinks. Just little things that made it less of an experience than the other location. Like I said, I LOVE cornish pasty and will always continue to go and refer friends, etc. but do yourself the favor and drive the extra 10 minutes to the one on Guadalupe. It is BOMB.",

The waitress never came to our table after 20 minutes passed - not even to take a drink order.  So two seats popped open at the bar & we bee lined for them.

Back in the days when the pasties came in just butcher paper, the cramped seating, and seeing, hearing, and smelling the cooking going on behind the bar gave it a sort of life and a lot of character. It definitely gave you a sense that you were one of those miners with their pasties. Well, with a lot less arsenic and grime.  My favorite of the flaky goodness are the Meat n Cheese with HP sauce, Bangers and Mash with the wine sauce, the Cajun, Rosemary Steak. I should list the pasties I don't like.  ...  Okay moving on to the new decor. It's dark, the chairs are church pews, the new bar is huge, and the atmosphere is a bit like a movie theatre before the previews show up. It still gets packed and people are hustling everywhere.  The service is good but there was a time where we couldn't find our server. Anywhere. The good part about the old place was that someone was always within reach if you needed anything. A few times it was even the owner!  Bottom line is that all of the pieces and parts in these pasties come together in an awesome sauce kind of way. The ingredients are definitely not cheap.",

For those who don't know, a pasty is your choice of filling baked into a delicious flaky crust, wrapped all the way around. Then it is cut in half to eat. Kind of like a hot pocket, but way way better. :)   My favorite pasty is the Carne Adovada. Perfect amount of spicy and cooled off with the cheese and sour cream. The Italian is also very good. They offer a wide variety of choices, something for everyone, along with a vegetarian menu. I am also told the deserts are superb, but I am always too full when I get to that point. Usually there are a few people assembling the next batch of pasties behind the counter, so that is kind of neat to see. Pasties are premade, so there is no customizing the filling.   They have expanded so there is A LOT more seating room. In the past I would not have gone with a group, however now they could easily accommodate. Good beer list also. I can't wait to go back!",

It's a black background with White text.  Pretty much all of their food is available for take-out, except for the alcohol.  *TIP* Make sure to look at their PDF Menu.  It has TONS of more choices than what is listed on their Website.  I wasn't even aware of this fact until I had ordered my food.  At this point, they do not have online ordering set up, so you call and place your order that way.  Cornish Pasty's (pronounced Pastie, not Pastey) are amazingly delicious.  They take whatever filling you choose (from the Chicken Alfredo to the Bangers and Mash), and they place it in a thin, crisp dough that surrounds it.  Think of a Calzone, except the Irish version.  Now, these are very, very filling.  They are modestly priced (all of them are less than $10), and they are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS.  Make sure you give them a try.  I will sure be eating here again!",

You cant go wrong with anything on the menu, and by now I've had almost everything!  My favorite of all time is the Chicken Greek and it amazes me with every bite!  What is a pasty you ask?  This is a common question, and I've never experienced them before I found this place or have really ever seen them anywhere else.  They are kind of like a calzone, but instead of the ingredients being encased in a pizza dough crust, it is more like a pie crust.  Super yummy!  And these are no ordinary pasties, they are gourmet pasties.  A close second to the Chicken Greek is the Spicy Asiago Chicken for me.  With around 38 different types of pasties, everyone can find something they will want to try, as well as an impressive vegetarian selection.  The ambiance is excellent too.  You really feel like you're in a European Pub and not tucked away in a random strip mall in Tempe.  The beer selection is very nice and the wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  This is a True pub atmosphere and is pretty dark inside and does get quite busy during peak hours.  Most of the inside seating are old church pews on each side of very long tables.  Several parties can comfortably sit at each of these tables, but there really isn't anything separating these long tables and pews, and there is potential for your small group to be \"invaded\" by a larger group moving in on that table.  I love the look of the church pews and dimly lit candle light that adds to the Gothic feel to the place though, and have only once felt a little \"taken over\" by a bigger group (was a Fri night) in all my years of coming here.  They have a very nice outside patio with more separated tables, which is an excellent option during the cooler times of the year here.  I remember when this was a teeny tiny little place serving amazing food and am very happy for the owner's success and their incredible expansion, not only to the neighboring suites at this location, but through out the valley and beyond!  I am a life long customer and will continue to spread the word of my favorite restaurant in the valley!",

    "text": "I can't say I've ever had British food before but if pasties are a good representation of British food, I'm a huge fan!  My boyfriend and I came here day after our half marathon run right.  We were looking for something tasty and different to try in Arizona before we headed back to San Fran.  Based on the reviews, we picked this place and didn't regret it one bit.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala which was perfectly cooked.  Don't know how they do it but everything was perfectly seasoned, the chicken was very tender, and the potatoes perfectly cooked.  Great meal in a pocket, my favorite kind of easy to eat fair.   My boyfriend was disappointed that they ran out of the peppered steak.  His frown was turned upside down soon enough after he had first few bites of his back-up order, Rosemary steak.  I had a bite and it was definitely was really well seasoned, beef was tender, and the flavor combination was great!  Thank goodness I planned ahead for dessert.  I only finished half of mine so I could have room for their chocolate bread and butter pudding which did not disappoint.  We had it with creme anglaise and it was a delicious decadent chocolate goodness.  Be warned, the chocolate brandy is very strong in this one.  On the service side, it wasn't a busy day and our waiter was super nice, attentive, and the food came at a reasonable time for it to be freshly made to order.   Overall a great experience, and I'll definitely come back to try a few other pasties.",

I tasted a friend's pasty and wasn't very good. A slightly better hotpocket really.  After telling a friend about how bad the service was, she told me she also got horrible service and got food poisoning after eating there a few weeks earlier.

My favorite pasty is the Lovely Bit of Salmon, and it sure is ... well ... lovely. I don't know how they manage to get so much delicious into a little pastry pocket. I was afraid the whole thing would taste fishy, but it was perfectly balanced with seasonings, asparagus and a little bit of potatoes. My husband's tried four or five different pasties and loved them all.   We've even gotten them to go, and they're still great. We like bringing out-of-town friends here since it's a unique little place with great food and lots of character. I'd love to try one of the desserts, but I usually only finish half my dinner pasty and have no room!",

Once you arrive you will notice two entrances the one to your right is the original restaurant with bar stools. And the entrance to your left is the new addition that has a bar and table seating.   Since all of the pasties are made from scratch be patient you will wait 30 minutes for your order but they are so worth it. All of the pasties come with a side sauce or dressing ranging from red wine gravy, mint yogurt, tzatziki, tahini, to peppercorn brandy cream sauce.  Since I love spicy food I normally get the Carne Adovada or the Cajun Chicken.   Carne Adovada $9.50 Simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar. With a side of sour cream and salsa.  Cajun Chicken $9.00 Spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss. With a side of chipotle sauce.",

Then one day someone eaves dropped on our convo, and corrected me. So now I say it right most of the time..  Anyway, this place is great.  Its cheap and its good.  The last time I came I had the Oggie.  Its one of their traditional pasties.  It has steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy.   I am always attempting different pasties everytime I come. And every single one has been great so far.  Hubby had the Cajun Chicken and that was good.  Their pasties run from $8-9.50.  You get a nice portion size and if you really feel like sharing you can do with one.  But I recommend getting your own and doing a nice switch with one half of your pasty.  Much more fun that way and worth the calories!  It has expanded since the last time I was there.  So if you walk in and see that cramped area where they do all the cooking; keep walking and you will see that it opens up to a nice spacious area.  We learned the hard way.  After sitting for awhile, we were watching the cooks take out pasty after pasty.  We kept looking around, wondering what the hell?!  We thought we were the only ones.  But I finally decided to see what was up, lo and behold!  A whole new section.  Overall a wonderful place",

Some of them are delicious (um, the lamb one...!) and some are just okay (the reuben..eh). Drinks are normal, they ran out of the beer I actually liked so I had to settle.

I've been to the ones in Tempe and Scottsdale and the service is a little slow but the waiters/waitresses are super nice.",

Not unless we all sat shoulder-to-shoulder with our arms squeezed under the table. Oh well, all 20 people weren't there at the same time, and a few people stood, so the 14ish people that were sitting, were comfortable. But, being a looooooong bench at a table, it was kind of a pain when the person in the middle wanted to get out of their seat.  The pasty I had (some southwesternish thing, I think) was okay. I've never had a pasty before and if I ever return (which I have no objection to), I will order something different. The drink menu listed cider on tap. They didn't have any. I don't know if it was just that night, or permanently, but I was sad. Our server was great, though. For a busy night, he was pretty attentive.",

I love this original location and its gotten even better with the expansion. For the money you really can not go anywhere as good in Phx. My wife usually can share one pasty and be plenty full.   As for which ones to pick my favorite is the Cajun chicken and the Meat and Cheese. I've also tried the pilgrim, Italian and original all which are really good. I'm just a meat and potato type of guy so I like the more basic pasty.   Overall a great place to come. It's dark, walls painted black, and usually good music playing. I've only come here for lunch so I can't speak for the night time scene but I'm sure it's chill and fun.",

But this is the best I've ever had, I mean that and I've spent lots of time in Cornwall.  I had the traditional pasty as the benchmark and it was fantastic. The filling was spot on, as was the pastry. The menu was very diverse, with things that should never be in a bit of pastry - Hamburger & fries for example but other things that will be lovely to try the next time I'm there.  As for the atmosphere, I really liked it. There were four of us, with two little saucepan lids. Good music playing, skater feel, bench seats, all in all a good vibe. Please don't think of this is as an English themed place, if only we had things like this there. Just go and enjoy!",

    "text": "Okay, before I get into praising this place as a go-to spot for anyone within a 30 minute driving radius, a couple peculiarities about this place: 1.  The ambiance is dark and pub-like. No getting around that. If that works for you, cool; most parents with little kids, however, will feel out of place, and not because of anything wrong.  I came here with my newborn and 3-year-old after the zoo, it felt awkward but was worth it for the food and beer.  If you come when it's comfortable outside, then you can sit outside and not be in the dark. 2.  It's easier to see this place from Hardy Drive than from University Drive.  Ok now that's out of the way. The British pub ambiance here perfectly matches the food and beer. Great curated beer list, and the pasties are awesome. The bean dip starter had an interesting vinegar flavor, and came with great crackers (they were softer than normal crackers and I'm pretty sure house-made). The bread that came alongside the soup was definitely house-made and had gravitas. It was great! When I ordered my Rosemary chicken pasty, my server recommended a brown ale. It went great with my meal!   The crust was perfectly dense and flaky, and the insides breathed Rosemary while all the chicken and other vegetable flavors supported each other while sitting in a delicious sauce.  My mother in law is a vegetarian, so she ordered the onion and cheese, which I tasted and was FANTASTIC.  Service was really good and friendly throughout, and the food and beer support the time-travel and country-transporting effect that the ambiance offers. Definitely a go-to dining experience, even if you don't drink beer.",

I've ordered the Cajun Pasty and the Pesto Pasty.  Both are very good options if you like chicken.  I usually eat half and save the other half for the next day.  It's still good heated up the next day.  What I like the most about this place is the food comes out remarkably quick.  I've gone for lunch on various occasions, arriving around 11:45 each time.  I've gone with one person or with 4 or 5 other people and the food always came out in a reasonable amount of time - even with the restaurant packed to the hilt with hungry folks.  I give them an A+ for their speed given their popularity.  This establishment is fairly odd in a quirky way that makes you want to return.  The decor has \"character\".  I suppose the intention is to replicate a English Pub.  I'm not sure.  They expanded the dinging room in recent years and the new dining room is full of these very long tables where the seating looks like what used to be a church bench.  A little awkward whilst you try to chump down on your pasty.  Nonetheless and church bench aside, however you have to sit, its definitely worth your time to visit this establishment.",

    "text": "The leek soup is delicious. It's on the salty and flavorful side, and always spot on for me. The bread that comes with the soup is also amazing!  The pasties are hit or miss. I've tried several and have only found a few (Bangers and Mash and Cajun Chicken, maybe some others) that are really good. I mostly come here for the soup.  The ambiance is perfect for a dark english restaurant/pub.  I haven't been impressed by the service, but for the most part it's ok. My worst experience was needing to wait several minutes before a waiter came to me, but once she started it was good. Typically the wait staff seems to be minimally attentive... just enough to take care of you acceptably.  Overall I like it.",

Both of our pasties were somewhat oversalted, so 4 stars for that. However, don't let that deter you. Most food in AZ tastes oversalted so maybe its just me.  I'd say 'not good for groups\" (meaning larger than 4) cause the place is kinda small.",

This week I'm here for two days and decided to go out to lunch with a local friend of mine, and consulted Yelp for some advice.  The Cornish Pasty Company was shown as about a mile from my hotel, very good ratings, with a good beer selection... sounded like a great place!  We drove back and forth on University Avenue about five times before we found it!  Since the sign isn't visible from University it wasn't immediately obvious  where it was.  In fact, when we finally found the strip mall that the restaurant was in by matching the address, we STILL were scratching our heads as to where the restaurant was.  Finally I suggested we check around the corner and voila, we found it.  MAN OH MAN was the food delicous!  And Strongbow Cider on tap -- one of my favorites!  I wish I had discovered this place a couple of years ago when I had a long term assignment in Phoenix.  Now I'll only get to eat here a couple of times a year.  Boo!  I wonder how many meals at the Cornish Pasty Company I can fit into a 2-day visit??",

    "text": "Kristen and I are practically regulars here. I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome.      The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be.  The food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews.      If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks. You having nothing to lose.",

Rate 4.5 stars as I'm a big fan of pub grub and atmosphere that goes with it. Would have been awesome if had a more brit/euro style feel by adding sports tele/bar music but that's being awfully picky, especially for such a small venue. Food was great, huge selection but could have been a tad warmer (my choice). Beer choices good, unfortunately out of my first pick but can't knock 'em too bad for that, and a bit warmer as well (again, my choice). Wait staff very friendly and efficient. Didn't have any unusual wait for service considering crowd. Prices I thought were reasonable, and we left full and satisfied. Definitely will be back again.",

First off, the place has an hole-in-the-wall feel to it, definitely a cool Blue Collar working Pub atmosphere that seemed unique and not kitschy.  The menu has so many delicious options too...plenty of meat filled pockets for me and Veggie options for her and each meal is definitely filling.  I had never had a Cornish Pastry before and the little bit of British history on the menu added to the experience.  The Pastries are pretty much like giant Hot Pockets...but giant hot pockets like your grandma would make if she made giant hot pockets..IE: delicious, filling, natural, and did I say delicious? stuffed with all kinds of meat, veggies, mashed potatoes, spices, etc.  Definitely try it!",

With his awesome mind reading skills he figured I meant a place that had soup, hot sandwiches, and a relaxed atmosphere.  Cornish Pasty Co. was just the place!  Great food and they have something for everyone.",

I've been here around 5 times and I always try to get something different than my last visit. If it's your first time at this place I suggest you go with the original Oggie. So far I've tried the Oggie, the Italian, the Meat and Cheese, Bangers and Mash, the Reuben, I can't even remember them all.  But you won't be disappointed with this place, the food is consistently good every visit. The only drawback about this place is that it's pretty small.",

They seem to only hire aspiring models and bearded biker types, but I heard this is cool now-a-days. Food can be pricey and heavily buttered, but it tastes great and is made right in front of you so you can see no one is messing with your food in the back. Go to the Mesa location to avoid 'sceney' type people. They keep the place dimly lit and there is a smokers patio. Don't be surprised if someone there offers you drugs. This is a notorious spot for cocaine transactions, hence the 'sceney' aspect. I don't judge, but if this business started drug testing it's employees, it would not have a staff, so don't fix what's not broken. Keep on truckin'",

Not gonna lie, they straight up feel like they're about to collapse, and they make it damned near impossible to get out of if you're not sitting on the end. Hope you don't have to get up to pee! Eek.

I had the bangers and mash, the wife had the chicken tikka masala. We loved each of them, and believe me that one pasty is enough to satisfy a big appetite.  We were not as huge fans of the fries/chips. Also, the waitress really had no idea about any of the beers on the menu. Since I am not knowledgable about British beer, this led me to order something I didn't really care for. Next time (oh yes, there will be a next time) I'll stick with the Lagunitas IPA.",

We ended up just picking what kind of appeared to be an entry.  We found out later that we went in through the side which used to be the main entrance, but was too small.  Within a few steps we noticed a very bad smell, but it went away after we kept walking.  We found out later that the smell is from a special kind of cave cheese they keep back there.  The smell was gross and made me think \"turn around and leave,\" but just then we were greeted by a friendly waitress who told us to sit where ever we wanted.  I was surprised at how dark it was in there.  I started with the potato cheese soup.  It was wonderful, but the fresh baked bread really added a nice compliment to it.  I had the shepherd's pie pasty with red wine sauce.  It was super delicious!  The crust was perfectly flaky, the lamb was tender and tasty, and that sauce was so flavorful!    I almost didn't order a desert for two reasons: #1 my husband isn't much of a desert person (and by this time I was so full I didn't think I could finish one by myself.)  And # 2 I was slightly concerned about my waistline.  I went ahead and did it anyway because I wasn't sure when I would get to go back.  I AM SO GLAD I ORDERED the toffee pudding!  It comes fresh baked so it takes a little while...wait dang it, you will not regret it.    It was not the kind of pudding I expected at all.  It appeared to be a little chocolate cake in a cast iron mini cauldron and to its side was a nice pour of creme anglaise.  I first tried just the cake and it was yummy, but then I began to slowly drizzle the creme over the cake watching it soak into it like a sponge.  The next bite was unbelievable!  It was so warm and soft and moist and sweet I thought I'd explode!  Overall, the whole experience was an A.  The wait staff was casual, but nice, patient, and informative and the food was very good.  I look forward to my next venture at this place!",

That said, the food is freaking amazing. I had the Mushroom, Spinach, Walnut Soup, while my co-diners enjoyed the Leek soup - both were lick the bowl clean, as was the bread served with the soup. I appreciated at barrage of vegetarian Pasty options, both more with veggies (like the delicious balsamic portobello I had) as well as with faux meat, Quorn brand (yum!). My friends had the bangers and mash and the chicken greek pasties, and both were beyond satisfied. One took an order of Shirley Temple Pudding home -- if I wasn't visiting from out of town, I would have too - it smelled godly.  Would suggest visiting during an off hour, as there are no seats for waiting, and it is ridiculously hot. Plus, make sure you have lots of time for freshly made food, and medium speed service.

Its a baked pastry with some sort of combo of ingredients inside. The outer crust reminded me of a chicken pot pie.  The seating is different. The tables are so long and the benches are pew-like, you could potentially share a table with some strangers.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of at this place is that the pasties are pre-made and you cannot customize your order. For instance, I ordered the Vegetarian Greek and I HATE olives but I could not get mine without them.  So I ended up just picking them out as I ate.  I also got the potato-leek soup, which I love and many places don't serve.  It was pretty good.",

    "text": "The first time I ever had a pasty was in Michigan when I was 10 years old. My grandparents bought them at the grocery store premade - all we had to do was warm them up in the oven. When Cornish Pasty Co. announced they were going to open in Tempe back in 2005, I was ecstatic and for good reasons - it was love at first bite.   Since 2005, I've tried many different pasties and still can't decide which my favorite is. The Oggie is a good standard- it's what my memory from Michigan tastes like only better. The Pilgrim is amazing - but only when made with Turkey. Honestly, my favorite part is the crust that holds the goodies. I don't care what is inside, as long as that crust is flakey and warm. Mmm... One time I ordered a small Greek Salad and now I have to order it every time I'm there. The dressing they use is this lemony pesto and it is so, so good... the only down side is that I'm still tasting it hours later. It's that strong! To finish up, you have got to order the chocolate bread pudding with creme angelias AND ice cream. The bread is deliciously chocolately but it is also soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, which I love. The husband isn't too crazy about it (\"bread pudding shouldn't be crunchy!\"), but that means more for me!  They have happy hour starting at 3pm, which includes drink specials. I've only ordered a Gin and Tonic here and as far as I'm concerned, it's pretty damn good. One time they were out of tonic and they made a special trip to go out and buy some, just so I could have my drink. I felt pretty special that night.  We have been to the location in Mesa and the patio is really nice, but the original restaurant has rustic charm. Whether you are sitting at the bar top or in a corner booth, you can feel the energy of the restaurant and be intimate with your dining partner. It's nice they expanded the restaurant and were still able to keep the same ambiance.   Anytime we are in Tempe, this is always one of our stops and a place we frequently take friends. If you are ever in the area, definitely stop in!!",

    "text": "Finally, after months of hearing people rave about this place and it constantly popping up on Yelp with fantastic reviews, I went to the Cornish Pasty for lunch with a coworker.   The whole time I felt so confused by the good reviews.  The service was terrible- they acted like we should have known to seat ourselves and weren't friendly or helpful, but doing the bare minimum assuming we'd been there before.  I'd never had a pasty before, and I was not impressed.  I got the philly cheesesteak which the waiter informed was nothing like an actual philly cheesesteak.  As far as my experience goes, they include steak, cheese, mushrooms, peppers- all of which were also in the pasty.  The difference was, this steak was chewy and flavorless, I didn't taste any cheese, and there were more green peppers than any other ingredient.  The pastry part was good,  but undercooked.    I was excited that they had specific sauces to pair with each pasty.  The server allowed me to try both- a mustard one and a red wine one.  I found both to be gross and a terrible combination with the pasty.   I just want to emphasize that I am not a picky eater and enjoy most food.  I was extremely disappointed that I spent money there.  Neither me nor my coworker finished our food and the waiter looked at us oddly when we didn't want to take the rest to go. No thanks. We were both totally confused by why people rave about this place.  Perhaps it is the good beer they serve...",

It is so good I want to try everything on the menu! All the ingredients are so fresh and the meat is so tender and beautifully seasoned! But the Dough is to die for. Baked to a perfect golden brown crispy melt-in-your- mouth goodness. Today I was craving another pasty but was too far from Mill Ave to go back but discovered the other location on University and got a roast beef for lunch and 2half baked pasties to go so I can enjoy them at home. Don't miss this place. The two locations in Tempe look like great places for craft beer but can't attest to that as I was going to work and could not imbibe, but both locations have seating and have a very laid back feel. I am telling all who will listen to try this place. I will be in Vegas in two weeks and will seek out their location there!",

The door is tinted black so you can't see inside, but once you open it, you'll enter into a dimly lit, but lively set up accompanied by friendly waiters.   So what'd I eat? I got the Bangers and Mash pasty coupled with red wine gravy. It's packed with pork and sausage meat cubes (it tastes better than it looks) and mashed potatoes. It's reminiscent of the microwavable pot pies my mom used to feed me when I was little, except this one's much, much better (thank goodness).   I also sampled my friends' selections. The Mexican is fajitas-filled, and the Pesto Chicken stands on its own league, but broke apart after the first few bites. I personally liked my pick the most, but I have a more traditional pallette. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the pasties.",

The bar tender is happy to make recommendations. For beer I had a 14 oz Bitburger, and then a 14 oz Kronenburg 1664. Both were cold and refreshing.   My appetizer was the crispy and flavorful scotch egg. It's a hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage with a fried outer crust.   My meal was the bangers & mash pasty. This must be what they serve up in heaven. It's a golden pastry filled with pork, sage sausage, grilled onions, and mashed potatoes. It comes with a side of red wine gravy. Un effing believable!  Finished my meal with a nice neat 12 year scotch. And I'm in love.",

The beers (good selection of craft beer) are priced very reasonably and you can upgrade from 14 to 20oz for $1 or from 20 to 32oz for another $1.  Crazy!

This location is definitely set up with the college kids in mind. Inside is very dark with black painted ceiling tiles and walls. Looks like the basement of a really old bar or maybe even a coal mine. Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.  Their west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.  Started with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sauteed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.  Everything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?  Don't forget some Dessert if you still have room. Can't wait to explore more of their delicious menu. Would probably go to the new Scottsdale location or the Mesa one on my next visit. Same great food with more lighting and better suited for a blind old fogey like me. PARTY ON TEMPE!  3.75 STARS",

    "text": "The food at Cornish Pasty is unique, freshly made, and delicious! For the vegetarians, I highly recommend The Greek ($8.50) and the Balsalmic Portobello ($9) - both are flaky, delicious and oh so flavorful! My mates enjoy the more traditional meat and gravy pasties and rave about The Oggie (steak + potatoes) and The Royale with Cheese so there's something for everyone and you really can't go wrong!  Service Very attentive and friendly. Relaxed yet polite servers. The waiter kept a close eye on our beverages and offered refills on our water. I'm always concerned going with a large group to dinner about the check because rarely do I carry extra cash and some restaurants make a fuss about splitting checks. Thankfully, splitting checks isn't an issue at Cornish Pasty. Our server happily complied with our request without batting an eye. The service was excellent so we were fine leaving a little extra gratuity since it made splitting the bill easier. Our waiter was jubilant over the slightly more than 20% gratuity, which just underscores that this is not one of those fancy, pretentious restaurants that expects a generous tip.   Physical space Beware: The restaurant is NOT visible from street when driving down University. When I finally found the restaurant around the corner and walked up, the windows were black and it appeared as if it was closed. Fret not - it IS in fact open! Apparently the restaurant also recently expanded and friends who had visited the restaurant previously were impressed with the remodel. The bathroom was the one place that suggested more of a pub and college feel. On the bathroom walls I found strange graffiti art. Some inscriptions may have been written by Lady Gaga during her carnivorous costume days or a confused co-ed (e.g., \"I am meat\"). In any event, once you find the hidden restaurant delicious pasties and friendly service are just a few steps away!",

    "text": "I had been bugging my husband about coming to this place for months, when he finally agreed to the idea.  We had eaten pasties in England before and he was not a fan, so he didn't know what to expect.  This place totally changed his opinions about pasties.  The beer selection was pretty good, but my husband ordered beer in a bottle that the menu stated cost $6.50.  When the check came, it cost $10.  The menu should probably be updated to reflect current pricing.    We ordered an Italian and a BBQ chicken pasty.  The expeditor brought out our pasties and we just started eating.  We realized that one of the pasties he brought out was not what we ordered.  It turns out he gave us the wrong order.  They all look the same on the outside, so how were we to know?  He apologized and they gave us the one we actually ordered to -go for free, which I thought was a really nice gesture.   It was also really cool to be able to watch them make the pasties right in front of us while sitting at one of the bars.",

Great drink menu, dark ambiance (as many Irish pubs are), great, friendly service and amazing food. We let our waitress pick our appetizer (Scotch eggs) and our meals. She brought 2 pasty's cut  in half so we could share. Mine had turkey and sweet potatoes and my husband had beef with blue cheese (many other things inside too but these are the identifying characteristics). Scrumptious is the best word for all of it.  Everything on the menu sounded like.something we would want. We couldn't decide and that's why we let the waitress pick. She couldn't go wrong. And... Everything was so reasonably priced.   This has inspired us to look for a good similar pub at home. This is a must visit place.",

    "text": "Who doesn't like pastries??? And savory pastries, much less. An 'Oggie', is the classic pasty that is still savored in Cornwall and all over the UK today. After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.  The broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order.   The pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.  With so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

It's similar to an empanadas and you can choose your choice of filling and it's baked inside! When we first came to this location we were a bit confused on the location, it's actually off to the side of this plaza and it's pretty dark inside, so you always have this pub/bar feel to this place. Service was a bit slow due to only having one server working but who really eats at 2pm, right? Well I guess we do!   I got the chicken pesto pasty and let me just say I was amazed by how good it was. I was able to taste the pesto, the chicken was moist and it was incredibly cheesy inside! What a great combo right!? I loved every morsel of this, I was actually kind of sad when I finished because I wanted another one but was too full to eat another.  My bf got the roast beef pasty and he loved it as well, it had a nice peppery flavor to the beef and the cheese went so well with it. Meat and cheese are two awesome combos!   In the future, when I'm back in Phoenix I'll definitely be back here for more tasty pasty!   Total for 2: $35",

I'm a fan of tattoos and this style, even though I don't appear to be, so I was digging it. One side is a bar scene with pool and other games (briefly walked through); the other side was the restaurant. They have booths, tables and 'breakfast nooks'; host told us to sit wherever.   Service: A few different people approached us throughout our dining experience and all were nice. Two were very attentive, but one first forgot the lemon for our waters and didn't ask if I wanted more water each time she approached (so I asked since my cup was empty and sitting at the edge of the table - I thought this was the unspoken universal signal for 'please refill me' but perhaps she's new to serving lol).   Menu: Very clear and not busy. I like that cuz some menus need to be revamped. So many choices, but I narrowed it down to four pastries quickly based on what I prefer. The Porky, Italian, All Day English Breakfast and the Lamb & Mint. I opted for the latter and overall was happy with my selection (one of my friends also went for this one and she liked it).   Food: Came out warm and smelling delicious (of course I had to snap it first). I wanted to try it without the sauce and it was good, but not tasty. Adding the Red Wine Gravy made it very tasty so it makes sense there's not too much flavor before adding it (ate 1/2 with this gravy). My other friend was having one of the steak ones and his came with Peppercorn Brandy Cream Sauce so I asked for a side for my second half. Sooooo good! I did try a bite of the blue cheese steak pastry he had and very tasty to me, but you must love blue cheese if ordering that one FYI otherwise they said it's too overbearing (perfect for me and blue cheese lovers tho).   Restroom:  Not very pretty in there, but I wouldn't expect it to be in a hipster dive type bar. The stalls were not painted by an artist, lol, but the bright color choice was a good try. I hope all the graffiti was written when there wasn't a line since there's only two stalls. I'm thinking AZ doesn't have the law enforcing toilet seat covers. They had toilet paper, soap, working toilets (oh wait one out of the two was out of order), and running water...so that's really all that matters I suppose. The owner had a sweet long note pulled from Facebook on the wall (it was thanking the community/customers for their continued support) and I would have taken a pic, but left my phone back at the booth.   Overall it was a good experience so I tipped well and didn't have leftovers.",

Pasties here are thin flaky pastries filled with many savory options from american to indian influenced   one pasty is perfect as a meal & the crust is what makes them so good ---oggie: the beef wasn't the best but the potatoes were flavorful! i liked the red wine gravy that comes as a dipping sauce!  i can't wait to come back & try other options  NOTE: in terms of atmosphere don't expect to walk into grandmas house because they serve up pasties, think dark dive bar (which was perfect as a low key lunch after our crazy night)",

    "text": "Ambiance: This is a VERY narrow shop in a strip mall that faces Hardy NOT Broadway. There are tables for 2 on one side and a bar on the other with a couple tables for 4 in the back. It is very close quartes. It is painted balck to represent a coal mine. You can watch the guys cooking behind the bar. Cleanliness: It was pretty clean and believe me I am always looking. There is 1 unisex bathroom, my hubby used it and said it was ok. Food: We ordered the Oogie (beef, potato, onion and rutabaga with red wine sauce) and the Pilgrim (turkey/chicken, stuffing, sweet potato with cranberry sauce on the side).  We split them. While good size they do not come with any other vegie, salad or garnish. These were priced at $6.50 and $8 respectively. I would never order the Oggie again because the beef was NOT tender! It was quite tough and the potato and rutabaga were undercooked. The Pilgrim said on the menu turkey/chicken but when I asked the waitress she said it was chicken. When I got it I saw that they use white and dark meat. The sweet potato was cut in small cubes and they seemed dry. It had a good flavor but just was not exciting enough to get me to go back. Staff: The waitress was friendly and didn't mind answering questions because it was our first time. My hubby had a soda and it never got refilled..she finally asked when left the bill. Drinks: Well, this is the best thing about the place! They have an excellent selection of beers and I got a 14 oz Kiltlifter for $3.50 a 20 oz wa only $1 more!! You can't beat that! Conclusion: I probably would not go back unless it was just for a beer, but hey I can get beer a lot of places.",

    "text": "What a find! Especially for a New Yorker, with no dining spot like this back home (but see below). Luckily, it's near the Airport, so it makes a great place to have your first and/or last meal on a trip to Phoenix.  Pasties are tasty meat or vegetable pies meant to be lowered to hungry miners in Cornwall. Fortunately for us, someone thought of  bringing them to the US, and particularly to the Phoenix area. I had the Lamb Vindaloo (probably not an import from Cornwall), and my brother had the Balsamic Portabello. Both were delicious; the Vindaloo was spicy, but not too spicy. Go ahead and order it - you won't be sorry.  Since this was sort of dinner, we then shared the Pilgrim, which incorporated turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and a side of cranberry sauce. This was OK, but could have used more turkey, and less stuffing. Pies ranged from $6.50-9.00.  Excellent selection of European draft beers in 14, 20, and 34 ounce mugs, the largest being a mere $8-9 bucks. Also many imported premium bottles, plus Tempe's own Four Peaks Kilt Lifter (6%) for only $3.50. What a deal.  For other New Yorkers reading this, I understand Myers of Keswick, a shop on Hudson Street, has Cornish Pasties and other meat pies. They're generally less than $4.00, so probably smaller and for takeout only. I'll give you an update on this next time I'm down in the Village.",

Everything was great served promptly and with a smile.  It's not Scottsdale fancy and that's what I like about it.  Best part is you can get a hearty meal with a soda for under $10.

My wife is a pasty expert since her mother (who has made pasty's all her life) comes from Ontonagon, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is knows as pasty country. We both tried the \"original\" pasty which we both agreed it was True to the original. It was hot, and full of the expected ingredients. In addition to the original the have many other types of pasty's, from Greek, to Mexican, vegetarian, chicken, salmon, to name a few. We would have liked to try some other styles of pasty, and will do so on our next visit to the Tempe area.  In addition to the pasty I did try a cup of one of the soups. The Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup was to die for. A bowl of this soup could have been a meal in itself. Beer choices were very good, and they do have a happy hour 3-6 and all day Sunday with $1 off all beers.",

Variety is always good and I was happy to get something completely different than what is offered elsewhere for lunch in the Tempe area.

Really, you can never go wrong with mash potatoes.  The sitting area is very small, but the bar can be an interesting option since you get to see the cooks at work.  I usually go for lunch, so I cannot speak to their beer selection.  That would certainly go well with a pasty though...  Keep your eyes peeled when going there for the first time.

My boyfriend introduced me to this place and at first I was thinking of a fancy hot pocket (not something im particularly a fan of). As I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere from the dim lights to the dingy checkerboard floor tiles, it reminded me of one of those hidden treasures I used to find burrowed around NYC. I ordered a hibiscus tea which if you are like me and enjoy unsweetened tea you will absolutely adore it. I poked through the menu and nothing really caught my eye until I came across the lamb vindaloo and I had made my decision. The food took a while to get there but considering the very chill setting and laid back personality surrounding this place it shouldn't bother you at all. It tasted great the only improvement they could have made was maybe putting a little rice in the pasty as well but to each his own. What really made this pasty delish was the cream sauce that accompanied it. I brought the heat down while complimenting the flavor. When all was said and done I was stuffed and had leftovers. We also go the garlic mashed potatoes which are equally as amazing but I would advise against getting them for take-out because they only taste good fresh. Me and my boyfriend love this place so much that we started a project where we get Cornish pasty once a week. He is starting at the top of the menu and im starting at the bottom and working our way down and up and trying every single pasty on the menu. Oh yes....its happening.",

All of the chicken and veggies are wrapped up in a pie type crust with the gravy on the side for dipping.  I have never enjoyed a pot pie as much as this one.  The only thing that was slightly off, was the lighting is very dark and the portions are small.  With that said, the portions being small left us room for dessert.  The dessert was out of this world!  You cannot go wrong with any of their items on the menu! I will be back for lunch for sure, and will bring visitors to this location too!",

The friendliness of the wait staff and comfy and casual atmosphere of this place won me over pretty quickly though. After reading reviews here I decided to order the chicken tikka masala and that did not disappoint. My brother got their original with steak and potatoes and he loved that as well. Those little things are really filling. I came in ravenously hungry thinking I would have room in my stomach after finishing the whole thing, but after half I was already satiated.",

After having read the reviews, I decided to give it a shot once I realized that they actually do have a fairly extensive veggie-friendly menu.  Despite not being a fan of fake meat products, I decided to try the veggie asiago chicken pasty and was pleasantly surprised.  The brand of \"wheat meat\" that they use actually had good flavor and an unusually normal texture.  The pasty also contained corn, black beans, hatch chiles, stewed tomatoes, and was not overwhelmingly heaped with asiago cheese.  The salsa that was served on the side was flavorful and a nice accompaniment to the already spicy pasty.  The crust was flavorful and flaky, just like the pasties that I remember getting growing up.  The only drawback is that the place is incredibly small and between the loud music and the conversations of other customers, my ears were ringing by the time I left.  The food is certainly worthwhile, though, and I think this may become one of my regular take out spots for lunch.",

For the basics, this is a British Pub that serves Pasty's. A pasty is the British version of a hot pocket or their take on the calzone, kinda. It is more crunchy and flaky, in a good way and they seemed to have figured out how to make them repeatably good.  After a full day of hiking and walking around in the sun and sand of the Arizona desert we decided to stop by here for some much needed good food. My friends swore by this food, but I was a little skeptical as I am not the biggest fan of flaky things as main course. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty and it was awesome. I completely loved it. They did such a good job with the flavors and the pasty also complemented it very well. I might end up ordering this exact same thing if I go there again. My friends had mentioned that the Pesto Chicken Pasty is also very good and might be on the list of things to try next.  We tried some deserts also. We had the Strawberry Pavlova and the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding. Both were very good and worth having again, but I have a bias towards chocolate so will say that I loved the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding a little more. The warm, moist and flavorful inside with the crunchy and yet flavorful outside made for a killer combination. It tasted very good just by itself and also with the pudding/ice cream.  I look forward to going to this place again.",

I thought we were going to bar to drink some irish beers and I was about to turn around and go back out to see if this was the right place but, the chef immediately greeted us as if he knew \"Hi, come in - have a seat anywhere!\" The restaurant looks like a bar you could have fun during Happy Hour with friends after work - needed cold beers - YES! But, because it was during the work week and mid-day, we really wanted to try their cornish pastry dish. I'm so boring I stuck with the original \"Shepard's pie\" and my husband/I shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Absolutely, delicious. The Pastis (Pastry) was just so warm, flaky, buttery tasting, and just melts in your mouth after each bite. I probably could just eat the pastry all by itself - it's so good. The meal entree, I think it was a huge size for one person to eat but, as the history goes it was for feeding the miners, Lol! I didn't think I would be able to finish my entree but, surprisingly I did. I was super stuffed though but, my kane (husband) wanted dessert - so crazy! So we shared the toffee pudding - ohhh so glad we did. The toffee cake came in a  cute little cast iron bowl with melted toffee all over and nice vanilla ice cream on the side - we both ate it so fast, we didn't even blink and puff - was gone!  Our waitress was so nice and kept coming back to check in on us, filling up our waters, seeing how we were doing, and being amazing! Can't wait to go back again...Yummmy, I'm hungry already just writing about it! LoL",

The waitress told us that all are \"partially baked\".  - My son asked if the Mexican was spicy and he was told only mildly.  Well that's all relative and even for a kid that knocks off chorizo and hot wings without an issue; found it on the spicy side.  - Wife's came with an option for sauce; she said BBQ and got 1000 island.  - \"Chips\" came out soggy  Overall the food was decent and the portions on the large side.

They do have outdoor seating though.  Happy Hour: $1 off drafts  Service: The bartender greets you when you sit down and checks in on you at the right time. He's good at knowing when to stop by.  Food: I've been here multiple times, but my favorite has to be the Lovely Bit of Salmon that I recently ordered. I think the dill sauce and salmon combo makes this pasty special. They don't skimp on the salmon. Lately, I've been looking for options somewhat on the healthier side and I would recommend this. You get your omega 3 and a flavorful meal. The Oggie - plenty of meat for the meat lover, very delicious, recommend to dip in the red wine gravy sauce that comes out with the meal  If you live in Phoenix, you should try this place at least once. But that'll be enough because you'll be back for more!",

The glass light over our table was broken and dusty. it wasn't one of the newer fixtures but one of the old ones that hangs just above eye level. all this accentuated with some very deep hard 70s and 80s rock music with some pretty amazing guitar riffs but very odd for a restaurant. The restrooms during our visit were completely ignored by the staff as they were dirty, and unattended for probably hours in a busy restaurant. They are also ignored by the owners and managers because of broken fixtures like paper towel and TP dispensers bad paint and lighting and a lot of graffiti.  Service was ok, took orders brought food, that's it. there were 11 empty glasses on the table when our party of 4 left. Maybe managers can find a better way to get a side of lemon slices to the table as mine arrived on a plastic drink lid.  The bacon wrapped meatballs arrived hot and greasy, they tasted fine, but I had to re think my salad order when I notice only 3 poorly chopped pieces of browning romaine lettuce that was used to garnish under the caldron that held the meatballs.  All of the pasties looked smaller then I remember and so was my Greek salad, Maybe I am just spoiled by the \"Scottsdale\" location but the salad bowl was tiny and deep and chipped. It was also the first time in many orders that I thought I never want to order that again. We almost always start with one, but this time I ordered my own.  This growing chain has garnered kudos, admiration and recommendations from me plenty of times, so I am aware that it can be great, but in this case the older child has been neglected and run amuck.",

    "text": "We were finishing up our Arizona trip and staying near the Phoenix airport for our last night. We found the Cornish Pasty Company on Yelp and glad to see they were nearby (and had all day Happy Hour on Sundays!)  The interior was surprising dark, but the outdoor patio was inviting - especially as we were heading back to the chilly midwest the next day. We grabbed a table on the patio and were greeted by our server shortly after.  We opted for a couple of beers as we reviewed the menu - lots of great options and hard to make a decision.  I went with the Greek Chicken Pasty and my husband decided on the Guiness Stew Pasty and a side of baked chips to share. The food was great, but unfortunately, the entire experience was overshadowed by the fact that staff refuses to enforce the \"No Smoking on the Patio\" rule. There was a patron at the table next to us smoking despite sitting right in front of a sign - staff obviously didn't care as nothing was said. I finally let one of the servers passing by know that someone was smoking and the response was pretty nonchalant; however, they did ask that person to step outside the patio. The group sharing our table was very appreciate especially considering there were several small children nearby.  Not even five minutes later, someone else was openly smoking right next to the patio door leading to the interior - multiple servers walked by and did nothing.  This probably would have been a four-star experience without the smoking!",

We arrived around 7ish and the place was packed, guess that's good sign right?  Only seating available was up by the bar, so off we went.  After checking out the menu I knew I wanted to give the Peppered Steak a try, it had sirloin steak sauteed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini & stilton cheese with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce and for a side I ordered some British Chips. The pasty was delish, the flavors blended well together, and the crust was perfectly cooked I was pretty happy with my pasty,,,,,,,  Until I tried a bite of my friends, who ordered the Carne Adovada which was simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies & cheddar and came with a side of sour cream & salsa, Oh My Lawd, that's just a perfect pocket of food! Instantly I had plate envy and no longer wanted mine, which was delish on its own.   Service was great and friendly, sitting at the bar was cool, and where we sat we were able to watch them prepare some more pastys to be cooked",

My friend ordered the Lovely Bit a Salmon [$11], which had some kind weird herb to it and made it taste unpleasant. I don't think the accompanying sauce helped much. The pasty is also very filling. I ate half and I was pretty much set.  The interior is dark as all hell. I walked in and I nearly bumped into someone. It's probably the darkest restaurant I've ever seen. Each table gets this tiny light that comes down from the ceiling. I can't imagine eating inside.  So we ate outside on the awkwardly too big wooden tables and sat on the immobile seats that are placed too far from the table.  The waiter was very chill. Too chill? Like skater boy chill.   I read that the other locations are better, so I would probably eat at one of those places rather than the tempe location.",

Several companions and I visited the Tempe location for dinner. The food was very similar to the food prepped at the Mesa location, but that is where the similarities end.  Compared to the Mesa location, the Tempe one is both a lot smaller and darker. I felt like I was going into a dungeon since our table was in a dark corner all the way in the back.  Our food was good, but the lack of sanitation was very apparent. Our utensils were dirty and had to be replaced, and then the replacements were found to be dirty and had to be replaced. This was not a good sign.   Floors could use a good vacuuming, as the area around us was littered with all sorts of items from pieces of food to pieces of paper and even a cigarette butt! I'm not sure how a cigarette butt got on the floor, since no restaurants allow smoking anymore, but there it was, saying hello to us.  Service was much slower than the Mesa location, and our server had a laissez-faire attitude that did not speak well for them. They were more interested in chatting with other servers than waiting on our table.  I've given the three stars only because the food is the same tasty dishes that are served in Mesa, but as far as I am concerned, this place needs a visit from the owner and from the health department.",

    "text": "Ok, I was at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards across the street for their grand opening and someone said you have to try the Cornish Pasty Company across the street. Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.    The main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1  The second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.    The crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo.   Give it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

Conveniently located here on University Street, has a great selection of vegetarian dishes which piqued my curiosity.  Low-key dimly lit pub atmosphere and all the staff wearing whatever they want, even if it had a huge hole in the pit of their sleeve.  Very bohemian,  dare i say hipsteresque. Coming from the bay area California i felt at home with all the avante garde styles, beards,  thick glasses and tattoos.  Started off with the Walnut mushrooms spinach soup, which was great to be dipped with the bread and butter.  Then I had the cheese & onion pastry which required no ketchup nor HP sauce, it was delicious enough as is and greatly paired with an IPA. Loved the rutabaga in it. Got too full before i could enjoy a third course.  Can't wait to come back soon and try their desserts and other savory selections with my friends.",

    "text": "This place is a bit obscure. It is kind of hidden from the main street as it is facing the residential road. I almost missed it on my way here! Once you go past the black door, you enter a dark, dimly lighted bar. There are large booths for large parties and tables for small groups. The bar extends throughout the entire place so there is plenty of seating. The restroom cleanliness is typical for a pub and is well maintained. There are plenty of TVs if you looking to watch a game there.  Since this place is known for their pasties, I decided to try one out. I ordered The Chicken Greek Pasty to go along with my Hoegarden beer. The portion size is just about right, wasn't too big nor too small. The pasty was hot and fresh. What made it really good was the sauce that was provided with the pasty. I almost didn't have enough for the entire pasty! My one gripe about the pasty is that I wish it had a bit more chicken. Other than that, it was superb.  This place has a good happy hour menu and a pretty extensive selection of beers on tap and on bottle. The service was good for the most part. Other than forgetting one of the sauces for the people of my party it was pretty good throughout. They delivered our food and drinks in a timely manner and was helpful with the first timers with what to order. I wish I can give this place 4.5 stars, but since I can't, I'll have to give it four.",

Imagine the contents of an amazing burrito inside a flaky pastry crust, and there ya go! Needless to say that I will be back here.

I was actually very scared but since everyone else was onboard I thought I would try them out. I tried out the Portable Chicken pasties and was very happy with my selection.   It turns out they are somewhat like a gourmet hot pocket or calzone. The listed ingredients are baked inside and the outside is a bread crust. All the pasties come with a dipping sauce that just adds to the yumminess. I have eaten at the restaurant (Tempe location) and also placed a large order for work and both were a great experience with excellent customer service.  This place is so good I will continue to order month end lunches from here.   Food- Excellent Service- Excellent, owner very nice and friendly Establishment- good parking but get's very busy. The only off thing is that it is very dark inside the restaurant for some reason they have dark curtains covering every window.",

We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen and the guys doing the cooking were very cool as a matter of fact everybody working there was very cool and willing to go the extra step for example are waiter was telling us about the beer they had on tap and we were trying to decide so he brought us a couple of samples without us asking-nice. As I said the guys doing the cooking and prep were more than willing to talk to us telling us about the different dishes even though they were very busy.   I ordered the 'bangers and mash' while my wife had the salmon both were very very good and for dessert we had the chocolate baked bread {that might not be the exact name but its close} good god it was soo damn good! Next time I'm getting one to take home.  We're going back with our neighbours this week and I can't wait!  If I could give 6 stars I would! Really great food and excellent people!

Now that I know better, I try to grab a seat at the bar for a little more elbow room; there are a few larger booths in the back too.   My boyfriend took me here on our first \"real\" date, and I'll have to admit that I was pretty impressed in spite of myself. I ordered the Pesto Chicken (decent) and he got the Lovely Bit a Salmon (much better). In subsequent visits I would discover the Royale with Cheese which is my favorite pasty so far. Also, the Mexican and the Carne Adovada are fantastic menu options.   Outside of the pasty realm, almost everything else on the menu is worth trying. The Greek Salad has to be my favorite of the salad choices; the dressing really makes this dish. Comprised of homemade caramel sauce, bananas, thick graham cracker crust, and whipped cream--the Banoffee Pie is to die for.   And now for drinks...they offer a pretty good beer selection. And Car Bombs are always $3.00 (yes, please!). The happy hour is alright, but Wednesday Wino Day is the best drink special ($3).   We can't wait to try the PB&J pasty for dessert next time we go back!",

    "text": "Yesterday I decided it was time to introduce another friend to one of my favorite restaurants in the East valley.  We went to the Tempe location which is a lot farther away from home than the Mesa location.   But that doesn't matter because the drive is always worth it.  I like this location because it is the original.   This time I decided to skip the appetizer to save room for dessert.  I still had the usual very large Hoegaarden to start and ordered the very new and not on the menu \"Spicy BBQ Chicken Pasty\". Anything with spicy and BBQ deserves a shot and it was delicious.   The chicken was tender and juicy, the BBQ sauce had some kick to it, the jalapeno and grilled onions were a great touch.  I am not sure yet if this may be a new favorite but if it weren't, it would be a close second.  Only one thing could make this night more perfect....well....maybe two things but I will settle for the Banoffee pie. It has been a while since I had the Banoffee pie and I don't know why.  Who doesn't love graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, bananas and fresh whipped cream?  With every spoon full you get everything, the crust is incredible, the caramel is sweet, the whipped cream is delicious and the bananas are perfect.  I was only able to eat half of it so I brought the other half home with me. Another perfect meal from a great place to eat, drink and be satisfied....anywho.  I know it's 7 am but I am heading to the refrigerator for the other half of my Banoffee pie.",

The (I believe) manager said sit where ever you would like. I asked are there more tables? He motions around the bend of the bar. We walk around and into a restaurant with HUGE tables with church pews for seats. Obviously not from a Catholic church as they were comfortable.   We grabbed a table and spread out. The waiter was great, showed up right away with menus, made beer suggestions and brought them quickly. We perused to the menus, a lot to choose from! I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, husband ordered the vegan pasty selection, kid 1 ordered Chicken Alfredo (it had bacon) pasty and kid 2 ordered Potato Leek soup with fresh bread. My husband and kid 1 devoured every bit and loved it. I could only eat half and enjoyed it. Kid 2 loved the bread and ate some of the soup, it was delish but not for him (blue cheese).   I think I need to go back and get something different. It was good but I just think it had potential to be great. I might try something more traditional or go for the carne adovada pasty.  Overall it was a great experience. The decor and atmosphere was great (great hangover bar as very dark), service was perfect and food very, very good.",

We tried this place on a Saturday night and left because it was loud with dark walls and lighting felt like a night club/bar (University location). We went back at lunch with my co-workers and I still didn't care for the dark bar ambiance but wanted to try the food because I heard it was good. I had the chicken portobello pasty and it was delicious. As for service, it was average. No refills or check-ins.",

Once you start walking into the pub you feel like you have suddenly traveled over the pond and back to America's roots BRITISH FOOD! I have always heard horrible  things about how British food consisted of mainly fish and chips and other bland entree's - to my pleasant surprise  the Food was Delicious! - huge beers  -Pasty for all food types  - the service is outstanding  Give yourself the gift of time travel and head on over  to Cornish Pasty Company  where you can leave the southwest once you step in the dark hall of the restaurant EXPERIENCE LIFE ABROAD!",

    "text": "I asked my daughter where she wanted to go and have dinner. She texted me back, \"Cornish Pasty\". I thought that she had dropped the \"r\" in Pasty. I, not being of supreme intelligence, thought it was \"Pastry\". So, I Googled, \"Cornish Pastry\". The search result returned \"Cornish Pasty\". Still, in my supreme intellect, I thought, oh they dropped the \"r\" in Pasty. I clicked on the link to their site and then I realized that I, again, had been fooled by my supreme intelligence and in fact, the correct spelling was \"Pasty\".  Now, on to the hard part. I still hadn't had my V8 moment because I didn't know that a \"Pasty\" was a culinary item. As I began to search the menu online, I thought to myself ( I would have thought to someone else, but no one was around) \"Hey, wait a second......Pasties are a dish!!!\". But, now having seen the fare (albeit electronically), I knew I would love this food.  As with previous reviews the place is narrow and small. But, what they lack in structure, they make up for in ambiance, knowledge and service. I ordered the Bangers & Mash and my daughter ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. All I can say is WOW. The pasties were excellent. And, for dessert we ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter pudding with creme anglaise. One of the best desserts I have ever had. I have truly expanded my culinary palette.",

I love love their broccoli cauliflower bake as an appetizer. Fresh broccoli and cauliflower topped with a creamy cheese mixture and baked HOT. Their NEW soup...OMG...its a, shit cant remember its name, like a jalapeno red pepper corn something spicy hot soup. Its awesome! Only get a cup though, cuz you need to save room for their pasty.   I actually have a take out menu in my car, i am slowly crossing off everything i try. They have a large variety, so any mixture you may enjoy, they have. Take some time with the menu.

And it was super filling. When ordering, the waitress told us it didn't come with any sides - we thought it was kind of weird, so two of our group ordered some fries for the side. As it turned out, the pasty was deceptively small looking and was actually incredibly hearty. I could barely finish it and I had hardly any of the fries. Sides really aren't necessary!  The major downside, and the reason for 4 stars, is the rather uncomfortable interior. I don't really mind that it's dark or grungy, but my main complaint was how loud it was. The music was so loud, my dinner mates and I could barely carry on a conversation since we had to basically shout to be heard. I suppose if you're drinking and being loud anyway it's not too bad, but otherwise it's not the best place to actually eat there. In the future I'll stick to take out.",

However, we only saw the expanded side because we were told to walk all the way around to look for the hostess which seems like a bit of a role reversal. After a short wait we were sat which meant the hostess told us she saw two empty seats at the bar...back on the other side. So, getting sat was a bit of an experiment. They are obviously still adjusting to the new expansion but it didn't affect the service too much. I got a 20 oz. Murphey's Red Ale which was fantastic. Perfect amount of foam on the beer, didn't let off any of the carbonation with a shitty pour. I had time to finish my beer before my pasty came out which was a bit long but permissible since it was rather busy. The pasty itself ( Balsamic Portabello) was very slightly under cooked but forgivable again. We were still in and out of the place in a little over an hour and had a great time with good service. The only reason I won't give them a 5 is because they could stand to create a better system for seating people now that they are a much larger establishment. Overall still great",

The red wine gravy that accompanied my dish was AMAZING. The pasties themsevles look a little on the small side, but they filled us right up. Good people, good atmosphere, happy tummies.",

These are ALMOST as good as hers and easily the best I have eaten away from home. The owner is a for real cornish man. Never had a bad meal. Never brought someone here to eat who did not rave about it. Lots of variety, but I always come back to the traditional Oggie.  Don't forget to read the history of the pasty. My great and great great grandfathers were hard rock miners and the work they did was hard and dangerous. They deserved good food and they got it. Now you can too - without having to enter a mine!",

Basically a cheeseburger with caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, and potatoes. But it's so much more than the description. For some reason, everything just comes together perfectly in every bite. And add a little barbecue sauce...bliss.  I've never had a bad pastie. The oggie and shepherd's pie are classic. The italian ones are good. The apple one for dessert...better than apple pie. Banoffee pie is great too.  Portions are big. 1/2 is a good meal. Eat the whole thing and you'll be stuffed.   Don't take impatient friends here. These things can take a while to bake!",

    "text": "I seem to be attracted to restaurants that sell fancy versions of my favorite cheap eats.. (hello Republic Ramen Noodles!).   Anywho, I decided to check out Cornish Pasty Co based on the fact that my friends seemed to go there a lot, and I had heard nothing but good things about this restaurant. Last night we went, around dinner rush. The place was packed and I didnt know it was a \"seat yourself\" establishment. Our server directed us all the way to the back where we shared a table with some other people. This place has a really cozy feel, its definitely not a restaurant fit for large groups of people. I went with my boyfriend and his brother. I got the Lovely Bit o' Salmon pasty, boyfriend got the Meat & Cheese, and his brother got the Cajun Chicken. We also ordered the oven chips. It took a bit to get our food, but I didn't really mind. When we finally got our order, it was well worth the wait. The Salmon pasty (filled with salmon, asparagus, red potatoes, tomatoes and spinach) was delicious.. especially that dill sauce it came with. The oven chips were amazing as well! My boyfriend and his brother absolutely loved their pasties as well. I even got to try the meat & cheese.. WOW. So good. I'm a sucker for anything cheesy!   Atmosphere wise, the place is really laid back, I liked how a lot of the people there had tattoos and I didnt feel like myself or any of the people I was with were being judged..sometimes we get treated differently just based off the fact that we have tattoos at places which is a big bummer! I did notice this place must be a hipster hangout since I saw a gaggle of them going out the back door, hahaha.   I will definitely be back, as long as I'm good on my diet the rest of the week.. hahah.",

Once I started getting ones that were a little icky, I just assumed they were having an off day.  I stopped going after my boyfriend and I got sick.  I really want to like this place, and I do like some things about it.  The crust on the pasties is always fab, but the fillings are hit or miss.  I always got either the Oggie or the Pilgrim, and the Oggie was more consitently good.  Once I tried the Pilgrim, it became my instant favorite since is had turkey and stuffing inside, and came with cranberry sauce for dipping.  But like I said, their lack of consistency, as well as the fact that I got sick last time I went, has made me not want to give them any more chances.",

Other than the lighting the inside is pretty cool. Large bar as well.   Their vegetarian menu was almost just as long as their meat containing pasty list. They even had two vegan options! I had never had a pasty before and I probably shouldn't have another again unless it's from here (we don't have much food like this is San Jose). Came out hot and pretty fast. I was impressed. Really flaky on the outside and hearty on the inside. Like a hot pocket on crack x1000. Delicious.  The service was the cherry on top. The staff are incredibly friendly and genuine.

You walk in and it is like someone forgot to turn on the lights.  I have no idea why it needs to be so dark but it is hard to enjoy your meal.  I am all about a dive or a little hole in the wall but the decor and tables in this place are just too much to get over.  I mentioned to a friend that they must keep the lights out so you don't notice how bad everything is.  The waitress we had was just horrible.  She took forever to come by and when she did she was put off by our questions. She was able to offer a few recommendations as this was my fiends first time there.  When it comes to the food I loved it both times.  The three stars is based on the quality and taste of the food. Maybe next time we come by we will sit on the patio",

I recommend the shepherd's pie or lamb vindaloo especially, but I've never had a bad pasty. The soup is amazing and often overlooked, too! Comes with bread that tastes and feels like angels singing on a cloud in your mouth. And the dessert pasties are amazing--I have actually cried real tears upon the arrival of my apple pasty.  Service can be a bit slow on busy nights, but a 32 oz Raj IPA never fails to make the wait an enjoyable one for me. If you like a quiet spot to sit, you'd probably be best off on the patio.",

Knowing from my last visit that the pasties would all be excellent - and they were - what truly wowed during this visit to Cornish Pasty Co was actually the soup, a recommendation from our server as \"her favorite thing on the menu\" - a dense, creamless potage with a hefty mushroom nose and a subtle vegetal note on the tongue while the walnut base added a lingering smoothness that went well with the hearty housemade soda bread and cultured butter.  Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)",

This place is a dark, dimly lit british pub-style restaurant.  It was completely slammed, with loads of mostly college aged people.  Everyone seemed to be laughing, talking, and having a genuinely good time.  We sat at the best seats in the house, the bar, and got to watch the staff work their magic. From there, you could see most of the kitchen work as well as the bar work.  Always fun, and the staff were plenty entertaining, ha ha.  My wife and I each tried a pasty to share, me the Oggie, and Stacy had the shepherds pie.  The Oggie is their traditional pasty, with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. So good!  I also tried some of my wife's, which was very good as well.  In addition, we split an order of the chips (fries).  The food took a while, but it's all made fresh and baked, and very much worth the wait.  It was cooked to perfection!  We had a GREAT experience here, and can't wait to go back.  Do yourself a favor and go check them out!",

Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding - homemade bread, baked in chocolate brandy sauce until crispy on the outside, served warm with vanilla ice cream. Who looks and that and doesn't think, \"I want that inside of me\" immediately? Nobody.  When I ordered it, the waiter replied with, \"You know what makes this even better? If you ordered a shot of Rumple Minze (peppermint liqueur) and dipped your spoon in it before every bite.\" As if it needed to be better.  Now I might never get a pasty from Cornish Pasty Co., but gaddamnit, rules were made to be broken. And warm chocolate bread and butter pudding, alongside melting vanilla ice cream soaked in booze, was meant to be inside me.",

Depending on the pasty I get, I sometimes feel ripped off, but the last time I came, my family shared six different pasties and tried a little of each. There are some awesome ones, some not so great, but good.   The first time I got the Greek/Mediterranean one, I loved it. Last time I tried it, it was so/so and no one else liked it. Some of the ones I liked were the curry chicken, the cheese steak, and the hummus bean dip is really good too!   Last time I came, the server was very slow and we had to flag him for refills and such, but sometimes the service is great. Also, I love the concept of sharing tables (European style), the atmosphere, and the concept of pasties. It's not something you find everywhere.   I think I'll need to try it another time to determine whether it's 4 star worth; right now I'm feeling a solid 3.5.",

With that last statement I don't mean that the service is bad, it is enough i.e. not circling you, but checks in with you now and then. I like that. I also like their laid back style, and they're attitude that goes along with a unconformative beard. I like this brand service.  Since I barely knew what a pasty was, I ordered the Oggie, the most basic of pasties. It was good, but I can now see how more elaborate filling is better. Next time I will throw some more spice in there, and yes there will be another time. I really enjoyed it, the whole experience. I liked the atmosphere, and the food... and the fact that they have some cool English beers is also a crowd pleaser, if you are my kind of crowd. So food and drinks goes without complaint.  After a pasty and a couple of beers I was full. Completely full. Sense dictates that I shouldn't have been this full, but I was. Totally worth the visit, and as well as I might not become a regular - I sure will become the occasional returning visitor. I guess I'll end with - come here, support this establishment, not that they need your business - but you need to try a pasty and a beer experience.",

When we were seated, our waitress looked incredibly bored and plain disappointed to be serving us. The only person that seemed remotely interested in making sure we had what we needed was the guy that filled our water glasses and took our plates. He was awesome.

Those 3 words, squiggly symbol and numeral made me squeal and giggle with glee. The music they were playing was also very appeasing.  Monday night, Hubzilla and I were looking for ADVENTURE!, completely exhausted with the usual suspects that we pick up for take out, we headed down to the college town affectionately known as \"Tempe\" and whipped out the handy dandy Yelp App.  Up jumps \"Cornish Pasty Company\" at the top of the list.  Eventually we found it tucked into the back of a strip mall (weirdly unexpected location...but sooooo glad we didn't turn away).    Down to brass tacks:  The menu has a bunch of stuff on it, yummy-sounding stuff, inexpensive stuff...After a brief conference with our server (and a couple of car bombs to lubricate our speaking skills) we decided to split The Oggie and The Peppered Steak.    The Oggie was the favorite because once you added that red wine gravy to it, the flavors just kinda...pop.   The Peppered Steak, by default, was the 2nd favorite, but was also very yummy. I just wish that the peppercorn brandy cream sauce that came with it wasn't cold. Some people really like that, I guess, but I'm a warm-to-room-temperature-or-hotter saucy kinda chick.   Next time, I look forward to tackling their delicious sounding dessert menu (they have creme anglaise!!!). I REALLY look forward to going back (soon) to try more pasties!",

It is also very, very difficult to find.  The entrance is actually on the opposite part of the building from the street it is \"on.\"  The place is more college bar than British pub as far as atmosphere.  The staff are indistinguishable from the customers but once discovered, generally helpful.  I had the Royale with Cheese and it was very good.  The pastry was crispy and tasty, the filling was well balanced and seasoned.  I'm not sure I would recommend it as a place for dinner or just to grab a meal, but it is absolutely a place I would go to hang out with  friends over drinks and food.    I would definitely come back on another trip into town, but maybe call in and order take away.  I'm not sure I could deal with that atmosphere at the end of a long day of travel again when all I want is to relax and enjoy a little peace.",

    "text": "Cornish pasty = upscale hot pocket  I had the shepherd's pie pasty and Cole slaw. Both were fairly tasty. The Cole slaw had great crunch but was too oniony. The pasty was perfectly cooked unlike a hot pocket which is either frozen in the middle or scorching hot. The pasty had a lot of different flavors going for it and a good gravy accompanying it. Also the restaurant has a good vibe to it. All in all, the pasty was good but not good enough to come back.  HOT POCKET",

They are delicious! And the variety that Cornish Pasty Company provides is incredible.  I enjoyed the Rosemary Chicken (I had ordered the Salmon, however it was unavailable, sad... next time), and everything else my coworkers ordered looked and smelled delicious as well. The salads were huge, which is a plus.",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place after hearing alot of amazing things about it! And it didn`t disappoint!! There are so many pasties to choose from, I`m gonna have to keep coming back! And they do feature other British pub food, bangers and mash, shepard`s pie, etc. Noticed their burger is called Royale w/ cheese( Pulp Fiction anyone?). But back to the pasties!          After much deliberation and asking for recommendations, I chose the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. (I mentioned I have a love of Indian food). And it was delicious!! Flavorful, served w/ a side of yogurt dressing, I was very satisfied!  These are pretty generous in size too and they also feature vegetarian pasties as well but I`m a meat girl!  Great atmosphere and great people! Looking forward to my next stop here!",

    "text": "This was a tough review to write because I've been here twice. Once at the recommendation of a friend and we had great service and great food. Last night was my second visit and my hope is that it was an off night because we had pretty lousy service and the food was not up to the par set at my previous visit.   We walked in and were told to take a table anywhere. We picked a spot that had been covered in crumbs and there was dried food on one of the menus sitting there. Several minutes passed and we were finally able to flag someone down to wipe down the table. At least another 10 minutes pass before I am able to flag a server to place a drink and food order - I asked if we could get our server and the woman told me it was her we were looking for. We asked to start with some oven fries and were informed \"it will take a long as the pasties to make.' Ok, this is fine. My brother had a chicken pot pie pasty and I had the chicken tikka masala pasty which I remembered as being so great from my last visit. And then...the wait.....was looong. Much longer than anticipated. I hope this was just an off night...in the meantime, it will be a while before I'd consider returning.",

Their food also contains Tikka Masala variants (this taste is still debated whether it originated in England or Indian subcontinent). My overall experience was great.

However, if you're sensitive to salt for your blood pressure like I am then you might want to think twice before ordering.  I'm not sure if it's in the fillings, the gravy, or the pastry itself but the salt content in a pasty from here can be really high.  That doesn't stop me from coming back, but still...",
