    "text": "Great Wall is the only place to have dim sum in Phoenix now. We've been coming to Great Wall for dim sum since I was a wee lil girl. Back then, there was another place to go to which I favored more, but is now closed. The food here is decent, but definitely not the best. I'm not sure if its because I've been spoiled by Vegas' dim sum, but everything just didn't have flavor. I think the best way to go is to order take out, that way you don't have to wait for a cart to pass you by just to find out that they don't have the turnip cake you were looking for or the sesame balls. We ordered to go this time since it was easier for everyone to just eat at my Grandma's. It was ready by the time we got there. Overall, the food is ok, but I guess for the only dim sum joint in Phoenix, it's pretty dang great.",

    "text": "Just as many other locals have said, this is one of the best if not the best in the valley for Dim Sum. Having had Dim Sum in many major cities, I don't want to compare them with this place since it simply isn't fair.  This is as authentic as you can get in Phoenix. Judging by how packed this place gets, I would say many people agree. Basic rule of thumb is that if there is a crowd of Asian people waiting outside in the heat to get a table, chances are the place is good and pretty darn authentic. Fyi, be prepared to wait and listen carefully for your ticket number.  I can't begin to describe the dishes as I don't know how to translate them exactly. Dim sum is as much as an experience as it is the food, especially for people new to it. If you're adventurous, just pick whatever looks good to you. If you're more risk-averse, hopefully you know a dim sum chaperon to serve as your culinary sherpa. In case that you don't have a guide, then just stick to anything that looks like a dumpling or bun for starters. Eventually, the deliciousness will drive out the fear of the unknown and you'll be more willing to try other dishes.  Whenever I'm jonesin' for some dim sum in Phoenix, this is the place.",

Some standouts: the sesame pastries with the red bean paste and the coconut filling; the pork shui mai, the calamari, and the broccoli.  My most adventurous try? The jellyfish salad.

You want to go about 10:30 or 11. The line usually hasn't started forming outside quite yet, but the food carts are really starting to gain their rhythm.  Most everything is great, but do make sure to save a smidge of room for the sweet sesame mochi balls. Not sure what the Chinese name is, but they're the perfect ending to a perfect Sunday tradition",

It's the spot to go to when I feel like having some dim sum and chinese food, also since the place is 5 minutes from my home ^_^. The waiters there are also very nice and funny.  I have been to other dim sum places in AZ, and I still feel this is the best in AZ. They have the best chicken feet, which is very soft.  Must also try their ba'nh uot w/shrimp. There are weekend where dim sum can be very busy, so gotta come early and take a number if you don't want to wait long.  As for the chinese dishes, I recommend the pepper steak, the meat is very tender and chewy. Their shrimps with cashew are also very good.",

    "text": "I came here for dim sum on a Thursday at around 1 pm just recently.  Thursdays are not typical days for dim sum and 1 pm is pretty late to start dim sum, so I figured it would not be too busy.  However, I was wrong.  There were a good amount of people either finishing up their meals or coming into have a late lunch.  A good sign, I thought, given the location of this place.  It is located in a small run down strip mall in Phoenix, somewhat \"out of the way.\"  I didn't see much else around besides the strip mall and a Fresh and Easy.   The dim sum was comprable to China King's.   But I think I have a slight preference for China King's dim sum and China King is slightly less expensive in comparison.  Definitely better in quality and freshness compared to Golden Buddha.  I cannot say anything about any of their non dim sum dishes, but they seem to be quite popular for a particular clam dish in a dark brown (perhaps oyster) sauce.  Looking around, many of the diners had ordered this dish and were thoroughly enjoying it.  Maybe an option for my next visit.    All in all, I will say this is one of the best places for dim sum in AZ that I have visited so far, along with China King.",

Walked out with a stale taste in my mouth and couldn't wait to find desert or something sweet to clear my palate. The menus are labeled \"15% gratuity added\" but the server could not seem to clarify if our bill included the gratuity or not. We left a 20% cash tip and paid the bill at the front counter. The proprietor took my bill and cash payment, slipped it into the drawer, and started serving other customers. I had to ask for my change ... and added 'tip left at the table' in case there was some confusion. That was awkward at best and cheating at worst. Will not return.",

To my surprise once i walked in, the place was pretty nice. It was clean, and the bathroom was exceptionally clean as well. The guy who took my order was a little bit grumpy but he wasn't THAT rude for me to walk out. Once the food was ready, he came outside to get me to let me know, which i thought was pretty kind of him. Now let me begin on the food....... AMAZING I ordered the kung-po chicken and i have to say it has been the best kung po chicken i have ever had.. filled with flavor, seasonings, and taste My mother got the fried tofu and the sauce that came with that was delicious. I am not a fan of tufu, but this one was really good and the sauce made a good combination.  She also ordered an eggplant, i forgot which one it was but it was eggplants in a semi sweet sauce, she had no complains on this either.  I was very pleased with the food, the portion size, and the price.  I will be going back to try their dim sum. overall this place was really good, I don't care too much about the attitudes of the employees, i mean as long as they were'nt obnoxiously rude I think i'd be okay with that.",

It wasn't very busy, and we actually didn't even see the restaurant at first. We were finally able to spot it, so we parked and went in. On our way up to the front door, my stepdad noticed that there were no windows, just a great wall ;)  Now, it doesn't exactly look like much, but we had excellent service and the food was very good. We all had iced tea, and I think they were over giving us refills before we could even realize we needed any more. It also looked like they did some fun stuff during busier times, and seemed like it could be more than just a restaurant. I'm sure the regular customers have a great time if anything special and fun happens :)  Also, while the main area of the restaurant looked pretty standard, I was pleasantly surprised when I went to the restroom. I wasn't expecting such a nice restroom there! They must have recently remodeled at least the men's restroom, as I cannot speak about what the women's restroom looks like. :P  Overall, we had a nice lunch and a great experience there. The price was also very good!",

    "text": "Due to geographical limitation there are not many Chinese restaurants in Phoenix AZ; other than limited options to choose from finding a good one is not easy to come by either. The restaurant name \"Great Wall\" sounds old school; even the ambience reflects the age which comes a long way.  The restaurant prepares traditional Cantonese style cuisine with live seafood. Lunch serves dim sum; small dishes similar to tapas. The dim sum is reasonably priced; the food serves in a cart and circulating around the restaurant exhibits to customers to pick of their liking. Even though the food at Great Wall isn't supper good I would say the food is still pretty good. I enjoy their dim dim for lunch and live seafood in the evening. Example the stir fry razor clams in XO sauce, deep fry oysters, lobster salad, steam garlic king crab and coral shrimps in soy sauce, etc. Great Wall Cuisine is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Phoenix even though the decor is kind of outdated. I favor the traditional Southern China cuisine. The down side is lunch time is busy and the wait is long; especially during weekends and holidays. The trick is to arrive right after they open for business to avoid a crowd. I like showing up at 10:00 am. Is it too early for lunch? Never... you can enjoy brunch every day not limiting to Sunday only. Rather than having eggs, pancakes and bacons there are different type of selections to experience. This is also a great place to explore culture where you can find tables and tables of families and friends gatherings, which they don't just meet once or twice a year during Thanksgiving or Christmas but happening on daily basis. Enjoy the food and experience; I do recommend this restaurant; bon appetit......!",

Very pleased with the recommendation. We waited about 25 minutes for a table. As soon as we were seated, the carts started arriving. Everything piping hot and very tasty. Crispy duck, shrimp stuffed eggplant, har gow, baked BBQ buns,   Chinese broccoli, Singapore noodles, chow fun, clams, fried ribs and sticky rice all very good We will be back",

Good sized portions, average taste.  As we ate, we looked at the tanks of fresh fish awaiting their demise.  The tanks was so full of live tilapia, they couldn't  move.  The chicken dish was good.  The beef dish was a bit disappointing.  Black bean sauce typically makes a dish savory but this one lacked flavor.  I am guessing from previous visits that they excel more in the Seafood department.  Their clams, shrimp and fish dishes have been spot on.    It sure there will be another visit.  We have another place we like better in the Mesa area.",

I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was  kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born!   It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.  From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food.  As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day.  They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner.  If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD!  Chinese people are loud.  We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices.  I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant.  ;)  Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of  majestic China.  *wistful sigh*  Anyways, Great Wall will always hold a soft spot in my heart.  From sweet karaoke-infused memories to visions of old people dancing to terrible Chinese music.  Cheers!",

I'll just have to look else where because it's not the first time that we've been treated like we were bothering them when asked a question. Completely over this place.",

I was not impressed due to the lack of different flavors of the dim sum. Everything taste basically the same and there was not very much variety to the dishes. I felt like I was Forrest Gump because I had shrimp eggrolls, shrimp spring rolls, shrimp wontons, some kind of shrimp and tofu Square, some kind of flat noodle that was wrapped around shrimp, fried shrimp on a sugar cane stick, and then a few other dishes. Boiled spare ribs, a hot bun with BBQ spare rib in it, stir fried noodles with onion, sprouts and Bok Choy? My favorite was the dessert bread that was a little flakey with some sort of sweet gelatin-ish filling and orange colored sugary topping.  The food was all hot and fresh however it was a little weird that every time we wanted something including water, we would have to flag down a waiter almost in an unprofessional way. This meal ran us $18 per person.",

The wait was about 20 mins for a smaller group but it was 40 when I went with a group of 9 people. Something I dislike about place is that the service isn't that great. My friends and I had trouble ordering what we wanted before and half of the time they would forget our order. This time, no one served us water so my friend had to get up and asked a waitress and he picked up spicy sauce himself while he was it since he probably knew we would have trouble getting it. Even after that, no one refilled our waters or asked if we needed anything else. Besides that, I like the dim sum they serve here.",

It wasn't for any old dinner but for a Chinese New Year Banquet. This was a celebration with a 10 course meal. So it was supposed to be special.   We started out with the Assorted Cold Appetizer Platter which included jelly fish, long thin strips of tofu, thinly cut slices of beef and seaweed salad. It was very different but good. You really never get this dish but at banquets.   After this, we had Hangzhou's West Lake Minced Beef soup. It had tiny pieces of grounded beef, tofu, and egg (I think). Very good soup. Then we had Shrimp with Glazed Walnuts that had some shredded carrots on the side. What can I say. Very good. Shrimp, walnuts, and carrots were great. What I really enjoyed was the Fish Fillet with Sugar Peas. The fish was so tender and seasoned perfectly. Wow.   We also had Cantonese-style Deep Fried Crispy Chicken, Cantonese-style Roasted Duck, \"Lohan\" (monk-style) Sauteed Assorted Vegetables, Baby Bok Choy with Mushrooms (huge mushrooms), Yangzhou-style Fried Rice. The chicken and duck were amazing. It was a whole chicken and duck. Very tasty and very moist. The Lohan had all sort of Chinese vegetables I've never heard of but really good. Really different. The Bok Choy and mushrooms were really good.   To top our meal off, we had Sesame Seed Sweet Rice Balls. You can usually get this at dim sum places. It's a small tiny ball with sesame seeds on it with some black beans inside. Sweet and chewy. Really good.   So this was a banquet with lots of tables which meant the servers were just bringing out dish after dish. You eat a little of each dish and then boom your really full with some really good Chinese food. So if you ever have a chance to go to a Chinese New Years Banquet give it a try cause the food is always outstanding.",

Literally everything we tried from the Dim Sum carts was so incredibly tasty. We also ordered from the menu and got Sweet and Sour Chicken and Chicken with Broccoli. The sweet and sour chicken had a perfect crispy texture and the sauce was not too sweet, it was a great balance. And the sauce of the Chicken and Broccoli had such a rich depth of flavor that very few Chinese restaurants are able to achieve. I will be a frequent customer here from now on. Ohh and by the way, don't expect much in the dining room, this is literally a hole in the wall and the dining room could use a makeover. BUT every table gets a fresh table cloth upon cleaning it. Run down doesn't bother me in the least as long as the food is fresh and delicious and they keep the place clean",

The place was very busy and I was seated promptly.  I was given a menu to look at and then these carts started coming around with different types of dishes on them.  Many of the staff manning the carts didn't speak great English, so I wasn't sure what some of the items were.  I tried several different dishes, each had good flavor and I enjoyed them.  Overall this was a good experience, but certainly not the usual Chinese food dining atmosphere.  One thing to note is that the sweet rolls are out of this world.",

    "text": "Honestly, I've been going here my entire life, most always for family functions.  My family loves their food, and I think it's the best Chinese restaurant in Arizona--its dim sum even stands it own against CA Chinatowns, IMHO.    Oh, the dim sum! Har gaos are usually awesome, ham sui goks (sorry, don't know the English phrase) are perfectly crispy with good balance of salty and sweet.  Only in the past few years have I discovered the wonders of the lao sa bao (\"leaky sand bun??\")--which is like the bolo bao's more decadent cousin (lao sa bao is the one with the more whitish crust, with a runnier custard).  Dim sum is pretty pricey, though.  I can run up a $40 tab by myself.  For non-dim sum, this place is still pretty good.  Highlights are definitely the walnut shrimp, peking duck (though some vendors elsewhere are marginally better), and the beef stew (this is probably the wrong name again, but it's the beef dish with the tripe/tendons and turnips).    Great Wall was a family hotspot long before the post-fire remodel, so even though the current bathrooms and general cleanliness may not be on par with other (read: Westernized) places, the new bathrooms are waaayyyyy better than they used to be.  I think it's just a general fact that authenticity sometimes comes at the expense of hygiene. (it's still worlds better than some places in Chinatown).    Bottom line: don't let the sketchy neighborhood and exterior dissuade you, it's worth it!  Also, get there early for dim sum, otherwise they'll sell out of the popular items.",

The seafood platter includes, Jelly Fish (YUM), Seaweed Salad, Squid and a few other items. It looks a little weird, but it's very tasteful. The soup was GREAT, it had great taste to it. For entrees we had, stir fried crabs (LOVE LOVE LOVE!), a whole roasted chicken, whole roasted duck, stir fry beef and Chinese broccoli, a whole steamed catfish, pork fried rice, and fried quail. Everything was delicious. I never really liked quail, it just looks unappetizing. My husband insisted I try just a little piece cause he said it taste just like chicken so I thought why not try just a small piece. I must admit it did taste like chicken but it was a little too salty for me.   I highly recommend this place if you're looking for some real authentic Chinese food. Dim sum is great as well!",

    "text": "One of my all time favorite Chinese restaurants, and once which I used to frequent with great regularity when I worked in the area. Now that I've moved further North in the valley, I miss it dearly but still sporadically get the chance to stop in, and not one single disappointment in all the time I've been going there!   The ambiance is something unique, as it looks like a big banquet hall, not so much like a restaurant, and certainly not what you expect for a typical Chinese place. It's pretty cool that they have the back wall covered in aquariums where you can see the live fish, that much is probably worth the trip if you've never been. There is a feeling that you're somehow stuck in a 1990s hotel ball room, but in some strange way, it almost feels nostalgic more than it turns you off to the place. Maybe that's just me, but it's kind of cool.  I've only ever really sampled from the dim sum, but as stated, I've never been disappointed. The food quality is always top notch and the selection is usually quite good. The lotus wrapped rice is one of my favorites, and it's not a real dim sum lunch at Great Wall unless you try this stuff. While not a fan personally, my Asian companions have always raved about the chicken feet. They taste great, it's just not my thing. The bean curd and pork dishes have always been fantastic, and their several varying dim sum offerings with shrimp are consistently fresh and absolutely delicious. It should go along way to say that as many times as I've been here, I  have never once had a bad food experience, either during or after my visits, nor has anyone I've gone with.   Another thing the do very well here is the tea, it is always a perfect match for the dim sum and works great to clear the pallet and balance out the flavor in the food. My friends and I could spend over an hour just nibbling at our dim sum, sipping tea and enjoying the time away from the office, which is exactly what work week lunch at a good dim sum place is all about!   If you haven't had the experience, I highly recommend checking this place out. Just be aware that they sometimes get packed, especially on the weekend and for late lunch during the week, so go early and avoid the weekends if possible. Dim sum is highly recommended, and don't forget to try the hot tea!",

The atmosphere is nondescript but then again not too many dim sum places are known for their ambience.  My dings on the place are very minor: their selection is limited in the first hour of opening, and i would like to see lazy susans setup on the bigger tables.  But other than that, they will continue to see me as a customer as long as they maintain the quality of food, affordability, and level of service.",

I'm only talking a out the Dim Sum as I haven't tried any of their other offerings. We were 10 at the table so quite a few, but the food carts passed by often enough to keep us all well fed. I have a passion for the Siu Mai and the shrimp, the chicken in banana leaves and the new to me horseradish squares, These are really tasty and not at all 'horseradish-y' so even though I don't like spicy foods these are now a fave of mine. What I also liked is that after finishing our meal we were satiated but not feeling 'heavy', and I did eat quite a lot: you know how it is when you pick from a lot of different plates.....you eat way more than planned !! There are several dim sum plates and baskets we didn't try, so that means we will just 'have' ! to come back again and then again.......",

I have been coming here forever, usually I bring my family, its like a family gathering places, thats just the kind of tradition we have, 'lets meet up for dim sum.'  If I can get it from somewhere else, I would, but all the other dim sum places are on the east side of town, meaning at least a 30 minute drive.    Food:  its ok, looks good, but way too salty and a bit pricey for the quality and quantity Service:  unless you know the boss, you will get cheap rude service most the time, that goes for us too, and we speak their language and are regulars  Prices:   A bit high since they are like 'no competition around, so we charge what we want.'  Be sure to check your pink tickets because they like to over charge, I used my phone to add up all the items first and they somehow got an amount $5 more that what I sum up, they won't give you an explanation either, say its taxes, or thats how much it came out too.  Found hair twice in my food, they did change it for another item of equal.  Don't order their soups, its loaded with MSG.  Kitchen is very dirty too because my aunt and my husband always get a bad stomach follow by multiple runs to the bathroom that day, so drink some milk before going to protect yourself.  That sums it up....if you have no other choice, then take the risk.  Personally I would prefer to eat else where, or even instant noodle at home!",

We order 5 dishes but they brought out only four. When we finished and checked out, one of them told me we still have shrimp ball is making, and that was 45' after we ordered it. I didnt want it anymore. When i paid i didnt put the tip in my card and he came to our table to check if we put the tip on the table. What the heck? Should i leave the tip for the service we had?",

The only thing I enjoyed was their egg tart. Service is at Chinese restaurant's standard, which you would know if you have been to \"authentic\" chinese restaurants before.  I think it's  weird when the lady pushed the cart to us and asked what we wanted without showing what she had in those containers. It's not like we don't know what we want, but sometimes it's a skeptical for us if they don't look good, and we would like to try other special  items that they may have.

As a Cantonese, I grew up eating dim sum so I know how dishes are supposed to taste like. This place is good enough if you're itching for some dim sum.  The dishes were fresh when we arrived on a Saturday morning. It does get busier around lunch time. The selection is small but it had most of the popular dishes you might be looking for. The shrimp had a nice texture (very springy and not mushy) and the rice flour dishes (wrapper for dumplings and noodle roll sheets, etc) was fresh too but the texture is bit too thick. Most dishes are lacking a bit of flavor (I'm talking about more than just salt and soy sauce). The only thing I did find disappointing was the pork dumpling (siu mai). They were misshapen and did not have enough mushroom. My favorite item must have been the stuffed eggplants.   Even though I am picky with the dim sum, I will return as this is the most convenient location we've got around Phoenix. Another benefit is it's close to an Asian supermarket so after you dim sum, you can just go next door to pick up your Asian goods.",

Service is good too. Not like some other Chinese restaurant that waiters may be too pushy to give you food, waiters/waitresses in this restaurant are really nice and friendly.   You don't really have any menus to pick from. You can only take dishes and plants from the carts. So you have to really familiar with dim sum to go there (or go with a friend who knows dim sum).  They have the most common dim sums and dishes in dim sum places. They also have some other stuff that I think Americans will like. For example, fried chicken wings. Some items may not be very healthy for you, but I guess it's fine to eat it once in a while.   Overall, I really like this restaurant. Tasty food, fast service, nice experience. Five Stars.

I arrived 15 before it opened and even waited 20 min for my party to arrive and we still got sat right away.  The food was good but there wasn't much of a variety of dumplings available.  The service was above average the restaurant seemed clean enough.  The only problem I had was that there wasn't really a variety of food to eat.  As we were leaving (about an hour after it initially opened) I saw more and more different dumplings come out.  My suggestion, come a little later (around noon) and endure the wait for a wider variety of dumplings.",

What brought this place down is that the dim sum arrives cold.  The selection is limited to the usual stuff.  They run out of sweets such as Orange Balls.   The 1 hour wait is NOT worth it at all.  Go to Phoenix Palace.  Walk right in.    The staff is very nice and the facility is clean.",

When we got home it was so frustrating that the chicken pieces were as small as the rice and there were no taste at all. This restaurant makes a lot of money with the good food but to get cheap with ingredients is sad. A good chef should always taste their food before sending it out to the public.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I'm really glad I came here with people who knew what they were doing and could communicate effectively with the staff. Had I come here alone, I think I would have been lost. Anyway, I came with a meetup group of about 10 people. We packed in around the table and ordered tons of different food items. The best items, in my opinion, were the fresh wide noodles with the meat inside, the bok choy, the shu mai, the pork bao and the custard dessert. The bok choy was especially delicious, sauteed in some savory sauce, yet still a little crunchy. The rest of the food was highly fishy and not so awesome. I tried to be adventurous and eat all of the food on the table, so maybe that was my problem. Anyway, I would like to give it another shot, as there were some tasty looking items on others' tables that I would like to try, but it isn't quite at the 4 star level yet in my mind.   PS because of the big group, we had a lot of food for only 8$ each, not bad. I think if you came here with 2 people your bill would be significantly higher.",

And mark my words, my family will never stop coming here. Ever. We've spent birthdays and holidays dim summing here. The sometimes long waits and groups of people gathered outside waiting anxiously to be called is a testament to the quality and authenticity of the restaurant. The weekday dim sum options aren't as vast and great as the weekend but dim sum is really a good idea any day of the week for lunch before it ends at 2 pm. I can't speak for their regular menu because I've never had it but I wouldn't hesitate to try anything family style. Everything is so good. Please don't ever close down!",

Although, the ambiance is not as transcendent to Golden Buddha, the food was in my opinion..better.   Very authentic, and lots of  carts to choose from. The best pork buns, sticky rice wrapped in traditional banana leaves, crispy shrimp egg rolls, congee with thousand years egg...I didn't care for the egg too much as it was very over powering, however if you like that sort of egg richness then give it a try. Even though I didn't care for that part of the soup, I still finished my bowl! The tarrot root cake was my favorite part. Try the shu mai with the vinegar sauce...and oh my goodness the ROASTED PORK WAS TO DIE FOR!!  They even let you take home the leftovers.   Our table was not ready when we got to it, a couple of spoons were not cleaned well and we never got any water with our meal. The service is probably my only complaint.    It was a good half hour or so wait, which to me is a good sign. Full sized families were entering and exiting and to me, once again a good sign.",

Everything came out quickly but the food was nothing to write home about.  The chicken was so plain and extremely dry.  The house fried rice was tasty but also pretty dry.  Seafood soup - where was the seafood???  The peking pork was my favorite - flavorful.  The fish was also tasteless.  Did they just pull the fish from the tank and bake it and add no seasonings?    I would suggest coming here for dim sum but for a regular night of dinner? Probably not.",

The lunch special was $5.50 and included an egg flower soup, egg roll with mustard and sweet & sour dipping sauces, rice, and a good portion of chicken. It was crisp and had a good flavor, but was a little bit salty.   A server came by with a cart asking if I wanted dessert. There were several options available, but I did not select any (I wasn't sure if it was included or extra, so I passed).  All in all, Great Wall was a good and low-priced, good service option for a Chinese food. The staff was fast and friendly. With most restaurants in the area being Mexican, this is a good place to get quick Chinese.",

When it closed, our monthly cravings for Dim Sum went unsatisfied until we heard about this spot. The parking lot is worn down and the location is not close to us. Upon entry, we noticed the clientele matched the cuisine - always a good sign! The seating is much like an adapted ballroom. It looks like they may hold wedding receptions or small events there.   The Dim Sum cart came around, and to our joyous surprise, the waitress was one of our old friends from the Golden Buddha!! And, the Dim Sum must have come with her. The pork and shrimp dumplings were very tender and tasty. Careful, though, they're piping hot. The seasame and meat-balls were also good along with the shrimp egg rolls (come in sets of 3). Wash it all down with some hot tea and you're in for an excellent, authentic tasting Chinese lunch.",

In that more and more non Asians are eating at this establishment I'm wondering if anyone else discovered a price discrepancy from their tickets where they seem to practice charging more. If they have a policy of charging for gratuities on top of food depending on number of the party. It is not mentioned where I noticed. There was three of us and I discovered this after trying to teach my child about adding and knowing how we spend our money. I caught the lady from overcharging and she gave me a lame excuse. I'm a little sad when I see inconsistency in quality and service.   After 4 months I decided to come back and give it another chance but still they practice to deceive their customers. I guess now I've learned.",

I tried a Pork Dumpling, a BBQ Pork stuffed puffy thing, Spicy Beef and Veggies, and a puffy thing stuffed with I think Beans.  The food was OK, not as great as the AZ Central article.  I was expecting food as good as Ping Pang Pong in Vegas when I read the accolades.  I think I over-hyped it in my mind before our visit.  The restaurant is located in a sketchy neighborhood.

Once seated only one cart comes around with food and the only reason that came around was the waitress said she had completed her circuit of the room and basically these are the leftovers.  When you enter the restaurant I suggest if you come here sit in the middle or to the left of the room. They do not circulate toward the right.  People next to me never saw a cart and had to order off the menu. I brought this to the attention to a working staff member and he said there is nothing he can do about When asked to talk to a manager there was no one one duty. They also ran out of food and we were here at a reasonable time. They stop serving Dim Sum at 3. But in our case it stopped at 2. Did not see any carts with any new food. If it weren't for the left orders we at we would have not eaten at all. Such bad service and a hurry up in and out attitude. I will never come here again. My search for good Dim Sum and good service continues. The restrooms are disgustingly dirty. Not sure it it was water or urine all over the floor near the urinals but it needed mopping.  It did not smell good at all. Oh yea one last thing!  Who charges for refills of soft drinks these days. 'New low'",

The service was great, the waiter we had was funny and energetic.  The second time I was here, my expectations for this place has dropped. We came in on a busy day and the service was whack! We didn't know who our waiter was and we waited half an hour for food to come. There were 5 of us and only one person got drinks while the other 4 just sat there without drinks and our food came.  This place is great on a regular day but on a busy day it becomes a disaster. One recommendation for this place is to get waiters that knows how to speak English. It's really hard to order and ask for stuff if they can't understand what you are saying.",

Their dim sum used to be the best and only game in town, but the lack of selection; and their inconsistent delivery method just becomes an annoyance.  Saturdays and Sundays, during lunch, can test one's patience in monumental proportion as far as food delivery is concerned. Couple that with the erratic service, it hasn't made for an enjoyable experience in years.  However, if you are on the west side, or go to GCU; there are no other good alternatives. Hence, the reason why even though they are actually dreadful; they still have no shortage of patrons that dine here.  Yes, I will agree that their food is good. But, what good is it, if it doesn't get to you in a timely manner.   I try to avoid dining here. However, since I have friends that either go to school @ GCU, or former employees that work there; and this is down the street from one of my paintball fields - I find myself eating here with great trepidation.   If they could fix the inconsistency of their service delivery, and dim sum / meal delivery; I could see this being high on my list again.

For the banquets I've been very satisfied with the flavors, quantity, and presentation of the dishes. Service is hit and miss but the prices are good.",

I have been coming to Great Wall since I was a kid and it is something I would look forward to on a holiday or Sunday morning. Their hai gow and sui mai are pretty damn good when hot and fresh. You have to try going in the prime time of like 11am when they have all the carts out and rolling around. Although the wait may be an hour, it's worth the wait. If you go to early to beat the crowd you're only going to get a few variety of the different foods on the carts. I may be biased cause I have been coming here since I was born but everyone I have taken here have loved it!",

I love their green beans (sauteed in garlic, yum!), kung pao chicken, hong kong noodles (these are the best pan fried noodles I've ever had) orange chicken, and hot and sour soup. I've had a ton more things there, but those are the recurring favorites. Everything is super flavorful and fresh. It comes out pretty quickly too, which is great.   We always hit this place up when we have all of our family around, because it's great for groups. The one unappealing thing for me is the large fish tanks in the back -- they literally just stick their hands in there, grab fish, and cook em right away. At least you know it's fresh!",

We sat for couple hours enjoying every meal that they served us, oh boy it was good! Our table favorite were some sort of sauteed green collard in hoisin sauce, shrimp dumplings in clear rice flour wrap and bean curd dumplings. Our least favorite we're the sticky rice rolled sushi like with bean, it was mushy. The chicken wings were OK, but otherwise everything were good!  I wish they had the Chinese music during the new year to bring the festivities more fun.  This place doesn't take reservations, so if you are in large group is better to come 30 minutes earlier because there are lots of people waiting for the table.  I will definitely come back here again in the future.",

Growing up in Los Angeles, CA I can definitely say I am a veteran in eating dim sum and authentic Cantonese/ Hong Kong Chinese food. I took my mom and Grandma to this place when they visited from California and they said the same. This is the best one they have had in comparison to other places in Phoenix. On Sunday it's pretty packed so arrive early. We ordered Togo for dim sum that day and when we got home it was still good ! They really say  a lot  about the cooking skills of the chef.   We have also ordered dinner here plenty of times. Still good when we got home and the next day.

I judge dim sum places by their bbq pork buns and shumais and both those items are really good here! They have all the standard dim sum dishes and their versions of the \"specialty\" items. We always order shumais, shrimp dumplings, shrimp rice rolls, bean curd rolled with pork, chicken feet, and sometimes a noodle dish off the regular menu. The shumais are some of the largest I've seen, EVER. Food is always good and never too salty. With any dim sum place, sometimes you have to wait for the cart you want to come around. Dim sum is also reasonably priced, table of 4 can reach food coma level of fullness for $45-50.   The restaurant itself isn't fancy and is in an old strip mall next to GCU. It gets PACKED on the weekends so definitely go earlier on Saturday and Sundays. (review is based on dim sum only, haven't come for dinner yet, although I hear good things)",

If you don't believe me, come here on the Weekends between 10am and 12pm.  The sheer number of folks trying to find seats and the hustling and bustling from the staff would easily overwhelm your craving thoughts!  Dim Sum is the alternative to the usual brunch of waffles and hash browns.  Why have a sausage link when you can suck on chicken feet? Don't worry, not everything is that exotic.  Most items they carry are very feasible and safe.  Dinner is also another epic adventure in itself! The menu is very extensive and could take you a couple of hours to finally decide on something.  Or you can make it easier for your party by asking for the family menu that contains a set of items they recommend.  This route is typically cheaper and feed more if you have a large group.  If you are adventurous, ask for the family menu that is Chinese! Can't read, server can help translate.  Seafood is always fresh as they have live tanks in the restaurant.  Service is usually quick.  It always amazes me how fast I get my food sometimes!  I used to come here a lot for wedding receptions and other festivities.  Do not be surprised if you arrive and half the dining space is occupied.  I would come here over those buffets any day of the week.  I would recommend dining with a large group to not only help with the cost but be able to chow on more dishes.",

Once they run out of a dish, they typically don't make more after a certain hour even though they close dim sum at around 2:30pm.  FYI, if you go for dim sum on Sunday, you will be waiting to get in!

The \"ha gao\" and chicken feet were very delicious as were the rest of the dishes we had, too many to name, the sweet \"don tat\" and \"jin doey\" were a great way to end after all the savory dishes, 11 total and it was reasonably priced, such a pleasant surprise to find this restaurant in Phoenix as I was \"craving\" some good dim sum and this did not disappoint!

Dim sum normally has large quantities of selection of food constantly moving around the restaurant in carts. You see what you like, you pick it, you eat it. Portions are small so price is decent.  The quality of food here was terrible. But come on, you say, this is fracking Phoenix! What did you expect? Fine fine fine. I'll stomach cold dim sum that was suppose to be hot, chewy meat instead of tender, and bland instead of flavorful...  The place is a dump and the line is 40 minutes long. Well, it is the only dim sum place no?   The chaos though that is inside is what get's the place a 1 star. First off I don't even see how this place is setup for Dim Sum. The tables are arranged in a maze like formations where the carts can't even get to you.  Forget the fact that the carts can't reach you, most patrons got up and chased them down and brought back their own food. In the end we didn't even get most of what we wanted cuz they sold out. One of the employees shrugged his shoulders and told us next time to chase down we want to get instead of waiting.   Totally not worth the wait, especially since the food quality was terrible.",

    "text": "I can't help but laugh at some of the reviews complaining about the decor and service.  Sigh...rookies.  Let me cut to the chase, you don't go to a Dim Sum restaurant for the service OR the decor.  You go for the FOOD.  That holds True for a whole lot of Chinese eateries really.  If you get great service or a clean, modern place, that's a bonus.  The more hole-in-the-wall, the better the food (none of that Panda Express Americanized junk).  I'd rather them save the money and keep the food prices normal than hike up the prices.  For those wondering, yes, I AM Chinese.  So on that note, I will have to say that while the dim sum was not the best I ever had, it was still pretty decent.  But that's not what impressed me - it was that they ACTUALLY had GOOD service.  That's what made me laugh even more at some of the reviews.  Try going to dim sum in LA, Houston or SF...  Here, ALL the staff was really helpful.  I mean ALL.  From the busboys, to the cart servers, to the head people.  You won't find that anywhere else.  Granted it's not top-notch service that you expect but compared to other dim sum places, this is actually pretty good.  I came with my aunts and uncle and they would ask for things like more tea, a specific item, hot mustard, etc. and either someone would quickly get it for us or the cart servers would leave their carts right in front of us and go in the back.  You can't find that at most normal dim sum places.    Oh my, and they even speak REALLY good English and so patient!  They even explain what they have instead of huffing and puffing and quickly opening and closing up lids expecting you to figure out what that dish is and if you want it.  They may not have the biggest selection of choices but if you can't tell, I was more impressed by the staff and that more than blew me away.  One cart lady even recognized my aunt and uncle from another dim sum place that they used to frequent but now closed.  That's pretty good.  I will def. be back.  Dim sum is like comfort food.",

Honestly, it's really busy on weekends unless you go early in the morning (right after they open), so I wouldn't even bother coming here then. The service is about 10 times better if you go with someone who speaks Mandarin, as we did one time. Sometimes you genuinely feel like you're being discriminated against if you're not Asian, but I think it's just the poor service. One time when we went during the summer, it was incredibly hot, and we all drank our waters incredibly quickly, and the service was so bad that servers never came by again to give us anymore. After a while, it feels like carts avoided us and we were not sure if we made sort of faux pas.  Just don't expect great service. The food is generally worth it though. If you've been to other dim sum, you'll know they don't have the most variety in the world, but hey, it's cheap delicious dim sum.",

We arrived on a Sunday morning around 10am and we were seated within 5 minutes. However when we left 45 minutes later, there were several parties waiting to be seated. Parking is ample and located in a relatively large shopping center. Overall, good experience and we would come back for more!",

Favorites:  Sweet coconut buns, chow fun (pork, but also come with either shrimp or beef), gyoza, calamari, eggplant, sticky rice in banana leaf, egg custard, and gai lan (Chinese broccoli).

After dining at Great Wall twice, I've concluded that it's just not worth the drive or wait time. Seriously. If you don't arrive as soon as they open be prepared to wait. The first time we waited for almost an hour, the second time we made sure to get there right as they opened and were sat immediately. However, we were placed in a corner booth where all the carts bypassed us which was very frustrating, especially with a hungry toddler.",

Legit like China Doll on dim sum Sunday used to be.   When you get the menu, skip to the back page where the real food begins: -- shark fin soup -- salty fish fried rice -- clams with spicy basil -- Hong Kong style noodle dishes -- lobster or oysters or both! -- crispy fried intestines -- golden mushroom with spicy fried tofu -- the list goes on!  Don't let the cafeteria feel of the dining room put you off. You're here for the best goddam Chinese food you've had in a while!!  *** the best jasmine tea at $0.50 per person for unlimited pours *** clams with spicy basil. Epic.  Take it with a glass of plum wine for perfect balance.   * sticky white rice that goes perfectly with every dish. Save for last after your plate is full of sauce. Devour.   ***** golden mushroom with spicy fried tofu. Leaves you gasping for air as your tongue goes into overload with umami.  * delectable plateful of orange wedges to finish.   Wow. Just wow.

My favorite baked bbq buns were too bready, with almost no bbq paste and even less pork, and the sticky rice and steamed buns had a bit of an unpleasant aftertaste.

Great Wall does a good job, but my roomie and I were fooled to think two small Asian girls could eat a plate of Peking Duck & an order of Hot & Sour Soup in one sitting. Nonetheless, the meal was good, crisp duck skin, good sauce but the soup was mediocre at most. Just remember, it's family style here.  If you come here, you should be for their Dim Sum! They get pretty crowded, but it's worth it. I always get the basics when it comes to Dim Sum so I get the Ha Cao, Siu Mai, BBQ Pork Buns, Soft Tofu dessert, shrimp noodle. I got the chinese broccoli to try last time, but the oyster sauce was way too salty- so pass on that one. Other than that there's not much to it, just point to something or ask for what it is. A word of advice, drink tons of tea! I must've drank a whole tea pot to myself while dining here.  Pretty good service, carts rotate quickly and are friendly. Love those old Asian women willing to have small conversation either about food on their cart or their business.",

Forget about drink refills and expect to either die of thirst or choke on your food unless you flag them down and beg for a drink. They don't really speak English so ordering is virtually impossible. During dim-sum (11am-3pm) they push around steam carts with Chinese delicacies which are truly delicious but half of the time they are out of this or out of that and it's hard to get what you want unless you're there as soon as they swing their doors open at 11am. My table and I have also heard one waiter that did speak English complain about not being tipped and how cheap everyone is nowadays. We were like, wow!

The decor and vibe reminded me a lot of dim sum restaurants in LA's chinatown circa 1990's (ABC seafood to be exact).   We didn't have to wait long before we were seated. We tried their sui mai, shrimp rice noodle, deep fried shrimp and chives wrapped in bean curd, and honestly I forgot the rest because it was all nothing memorable and I usually have a great memory. The chives and shrimp bean curd roll was probably my favorite of the bunch but I'm a sucker for any dumpling, cake, roll with chives :) It was something I haven't seen at other dim sum restaurants before so I enjoyed that.  In summary, it was okay. It satisfied my dim sum craving but... would I come back? Probably not. I live in Chandler and I find my two go-to dim sum spots there (Phoenix Palace & China King) much tastier. && I only have to drive 5 minutes to get there. Actually, if I lived near Great Wall, I'd probably make the drive to Phoenix Palace. Yep.. I think it's that much better!",

Ok, disappointed but I was starving and was eager to get some authentic food.  I asked the waiter if the eggplant was good, of course he said it was.   It was not!  I struggled to eat enough of it to get full!  I almost stopped by a drive thru bc I was still hungry!  Service sucked as well. Not one person came to check on me or to ask if everything was ok.   I'm from the South and I grew up waiting tables at my family's Chinese restaurant.  I did not leave a tip, and I always tip, but I was so disgusted with my experience I could not wait to leave!",

It was critical in navigating the ENORMOUS amounts of food and certainly critical in deciding which things the gringos could handle.  Thumbs up to postickers, egg rolls, chow mein noodles, shui mai and other various dumplings.   And a big phew for a tutorial on how to eat fresh shrimp. \"Peel off the shell, suck out the brains and then eat the rest.\"  Yep.   This is where I swig down a cold Tsing Tao  And the chickens feet. Oh for the love. The freakin' chicken feet. \"Just suck off the skin and throw the foot back on the plate.\"  Yep.  BYOA! I'm telling ya.  I had a BLAST. Carts were everywhere. Service was friendly and swift. Ten of us ate and ate and ate for $200 including tip. Oh. Also one of my Asian American diners informed me that the one man pushing the \"porridge\" cart only stops at the white people tables because the \"porridge\" is absolutely frightening to see. Sure enough. He stopped by our tables and scooted quickly by those tables full of Asians.   I love a place with a sense of humor.   Great food. Great fun. Great Wall.",

I have also been seated at the large round tables on the front wall of the restaurant and watched for more than 30 minutes as dim sum carts paraded through the rest of the space and never once breezed by our table. And when you are finally starving to death and watching a party of 6 who literally just sat down start ordering off a cart, don't think you can walk over and try to carry anything away, because the servers will not have it. You will return to your table hungry and sad, wishing you had driven to Chandler for the cornucopia of dim sum carts that is Phoenix Palace Buffet.  The food is fine, the service is below average, but if you see them leading you to a front wall table, just run.",

I'm used to seeing big crowds outside of dim sum restaurants but this place was SO unorganized and chaotic. There were 4 of us and we agreed to share a big table with another group of 4 to cut down on the wait time. After being seated for over 20 minutes and not one waiter coming by to take our tea order, my mom had to chase on down near the back of the restaurant.  The tea was too strong but most of the food was good. The haw gow (steamed shrimp dumplings), spare ribs with black bean sauce, jook (rice porridge), nor mi gai (ti leaf wrapped rice with chicken), and taro crisps were all good. The disappoints came from the sweet sesame balls and don tot (egg custard tarts) which we had to chase down a waiter again to procure.  Overall, I'd say give this place a try but perhaps during the week to avoid this chaos.",

The staff was very friendly even considering the language barrier. My children are in a Mandarin Immersion program at school and love to come here to practice ordering food. The staff embrace these little American  children even though this is a Cantonese restaurant and switch to communicate with them every time. They were helpful with explaining the dishes that we were unfamiliar with and even recommending what we might like. We have been dining on dim sum for years but if you have never  experienced it, coming here is a good way to start this addicting adventure! You need to come early if you don't want to wait.",

Also- fun fact! 85% of Vietnamese weddings happen there (The other 15% didn't happen there because there was a wedding that is booked at Great Wall that day). So Great Wall is not only a Chinese restaurant but also an important part of the wedding culture in AZ.  Go Great Wall!!  Who knows...if I ever get married- it might just probably be at Great Wall.  Come to think of it, three of my older siblings' wedding was where?  GREAT WALL!!!!!!  I am getting a bit sentimental with this review.  So lets get to the food.  Shumai= BOMB!!! I can eat this all day and all night.  I just love Great Wall's dim sum.  The only place that beat out their dim sum is a place in San Francisco- that tells you how great Great Wall is.   They recently remodeled their bathroom - thank Confucius!  It is now nice and clean.  Hopefully stay nice and clean.   The only staff I love there is Jimmy, this tall man who speak both Chinese and Vietnamese.  He crack me up everytime!  I don't know him personally  but coming to this restaurant so much, he's like a Chinese brotha I never have.  The service there is mediocre- if you need something, call them out and you get what you want.  Not bad though- maybe I'm used to it.   Sunday dimsum line is looooooooooong, so come early to get your number.   I really don't have much complaints about this place except the occasionally long wait if I decide to grab dim sum on Sunday.   It is always a pleasure coming to this place.

    "text": "There are bad eating joints, and then there are REALLY BAD eating joints, and then there is Great Wall Cuisine - it stands proudly at epitome of BAD eating joints, and if I know correctly, it would rule there for a long time.  Where do I start - hmmm.. let's begin from the beginning -- On 28th April 2013, me and wife had quite a hectic start to our day and we were really starving by 2pm or so when we searched for some Asian food joint and we stumbled upon this place. In fact we called the hotel to check whether they serve viet food as well - and the lady said \"YES\", and excited we drove to this place. Easy to find/locate on Camelback rd.  So we reached and were \"unpleasantly\" surprised with pungent smell of dead birds/animals. For first 40-60secs it seemed as if we have entered a poultry farm or s laughter house...  Yikes #*&#(!?? BUT as I mentioned we both were starving and were impressed by the ratings of this place, so we decided to sit through and have food.  Then came \"unpleasant surprise\" # 2... the waiter told us they don't serve viet. burrrrr... but we still persisted and decided to order simple mixed veggie food and hong-kong style noodle soup with tofu. the food looked horrible, smelled like shit and tasted like vomit. It was HORRIBLE... I just can't put it in words how horrible the food was... it was so bad that it would probably take me couple of months time to try Asian food again, if ever. It was a huge mistake to have persisted and continued, on the hindsight I think I should have left the premises the very moment I entered.  Well - the waiter and all were very respectful and spoke very fluent and good English, which was a little comforting. BUT then there was \"unpleasant surprise\" # 3 - the vacuum guy. This gentleman was hell bent to clean every nook and corner of the section where we were sittings with his back turned towards us which was supporting a backpack full or dirt/crap. He probably didnt realize that it smelled bad and even after couple of bad facial expressions from our side - he continued till the time we left.   I can't believe how is this place still running.  HORRIBLE FOOD, HORRIBLE SERVICE, HORRIBLE PLACE WITH HORRIBLE SMELL!!",

I believe part of it (at the time) was just a cultural difference and appropriate training on service.  Well here we are years later and they have made some major staff re arrangements. I see changes to the staff pushing the carts. They are definitely more engaging and interactive with customers. They offer suggestions and answer questions too. This is a major change to what it used to be back then.   The rest is still the same: clean, quick, spacious, big family settings, amazing food, mouthwatering food and did I mention delicious food?   This place gets packed so don't forget to arrive early. You can order to go as well/pick up. Sunday mid afternoon is definitely busy so plan accordingly.

You need to be assertive and not timid don't be afraid to ask questions etc. Go early on the weekends like an hour after they open... you get all of the fresh dim sum and beat the rush...

On the weekends you'll get the full experience with the crowds, the rush, and the loud din of servers telling you what's on their cart for you to eat. Don't like what they have on their carts? Not a problem! You can order off the full menu if you'd like as well. You can choose anything from steaming hot dumplings or massive plates of chow fun. It's always in your best interest to go with a bunch of people so you can order a lot and share.   Servers are good, friendly, and efficient. This is the place to go if you're in a fix for dim sum.",

I typically have very low expectations when eating Chinese food anywhere that isn't along the coast. I was very impressed with Great Wall!  When I walked in, I was surprised to feel like I was back in LA with my family. There are tables everywhere that can seat large parties. Along the back wall, you can look at live fish and sea creatures in holding tanks. There were people everywhere, and the food smelled delicious.  They have cart dim sum on the weekends. Be prepared to get there early, or wait to be seated. They have a reputation for a long wait, but it's worth it!! They have great radish cake and BBQ pork buns! I also liked their shrimp and pork shumai. The service is good. There are always carts out, and the staff is attentive. From now on, this will be my go-to place in Phoenix for dim sum!",

The service was VERY good surprisingly for a dim sum place I'll give them that, but the food tasted stale. The shu mai and har gow were standard, I never complain about those. The BBQ pork bun I could tell was old and was served cold. We tried shrimp, pork, and beef noodle rolls but these were bad. I felt like nothing went together and the noodle rolls were bland/stale. They also do not have the Chinese donut noodle rolls which is my favorite dim sum item! The egg tarts had wayyyyy to much dough, the outside wasn't flaky at all and each bite broke apart, moist, as if they were soaked in water. The fried sesame balls were good though. The stir fried veggies were way too salty. We got banh bo aka steamed rice cake aka cow cake and it was COLD, legit just cold. We had to ask them to re-steam it.  What I didn't mind here was the sweet tofu, the stir fried noodles, cha siu, Har Gow (hard to mess up, and the beef tripe.   Will not be back.",

Walking inside, you will find a typical Chinese decor. It's very spacious with plenty of seating. Accommodate medium to large party as well. Service is pretty rapid with a host seating you and waiters at your table pretty quickly.  Now for the food, we ended up going with the dim sum menu. They have your typical shiu mai, ha Cao, shrimp rolls, tripes, fried crab balls, veggies. Everything tasted pretty authentic. And it was pretty flavorful.   Overall, this place was pretty typical of a Chinese restaurant, food was simple and good. Good variety of choose. They also had a standard a la carte menu too. Waiters are pretty friendly however we had this one that was actually super chatty and pushy that kept pushing us to order more and more, which almost made it a bit uncomfortable... but besides from that, I think that it is pretty decent and I would give this place a 3/5 stars for everything. If you've never been, it's not a bad start, if you have, well this can take away some of the cravings. Either way, good enough but nothing too special. Cheers!",

    "text": "Lets face it...it was the yelp review's about Dim Sum that made me give this restaurant a try. It was not to distant far from my hotel, but not next door thats for sure. In any event, I had a taste bud for Dim Sum...so off I went...!!!  From the outside this restaurant does not give the appearance of something grand and unique, however upon entering, it is spacious, warm ...and empty...  Upon being seated and handed a menu, I asked for the Dim Sum menu...sorry, Dim Sum stops being served at 3:00pm....I almost walked out...I could have had Chinese food almost anywhere, but Dim Sum...thats hard to find and that was what I wanted. Okay, I'm here lets see what you have...  The menu was loaded with so many of the dishes that I truly like that it did become somewhat difficult to choose....but I managed...I ordered hot & sour soup (the bowl), chicken chop suey...and while I wasn't sure exactly what Salt and Spice Shrimp was, I was hoping it to be salt & pepper shrimp.  First out of the kitchen and onto my dinner table was the hot & sour soup...a huge steaming bowl. Let me say, I have had hot & sour soup all over this world and while it varies in taste and consistency, this soup tonight was outstanding...absolutely outstanding. Next out of the kitchen was this salt & spice shrimp...wow, these were not shrimp at all...these were gulf prawns...huge...took two hands to pickup. The shrimp came with the heads and tails, and shells...not a problem for me, but perhaps a bit squeamish to others. No issues, I hoisted up one shrimp and gave the head a slight twist pinched the tail and dropped it into my mouth. Oh my goodness...these were awesome. Perhaps the serving was a dozen shrimp, I didn't count them, but there was quite a few. Remarkable...!!! Last out of the kitchen was the chicken chop suey...let me say that this was not the actual name on the menu, that escapes me, but it was a chop suet. It was also fantastic. But to be honest, with the soup and the shrimp, there wasn't much room left for the chicken chop suey. I needed a \"to go box\" to bring the left overs back to the hotel.  So while i was not happy to miss the Dim Sum, and I hope to go back and enjoy that one day, I was not disappointed with the dinner that was chosen. Did I say earlier that the restaurant was \"empty\" when I arrived...well, it filled up while I was there...and I know why...the food selection is very large, and while I of course have not tried many of their offerings, what i did choose was absolutely outstanding...worthy of 5-stars for sure. So why only 4-stars from this review...I need to try your Dim Sum then lets talk.  This is a family owned restaurant...these are your friends and neighbors, give them a try. I plan to return...!!!",

Restrooms were a nasty mess. Food took over 30 minutes to come out and when it did they came all out at separate times, 20 minutes to be exact. One of their staff was picking her teeth with a toothpick and didn't wash her hands after serving food to another guest! How nasty! Food was overpriced for what the quality it had.

    "text": "So there is not much I can say here. Went here because I was told they had Dim Sum and I was in the mood.   So to start the place was about half full so maybe that's considered busy to them. We were immediately seated in a booth but that's where the service ended. The first food cart came by and the waitress or server pushing it was immediately demanding and pushy that we just pick and not look. Personally I was just waiting for someone to ask what I wanted to drink. So after making some selections I realize the food had hair on it so I showed her and she took at. The issue is she didn't adjust our ticket and I had to tell her. Instead of her removing it from the ticket she said she would find more food to replace it. My stomach was not feeling that I wanted more food but I let it go. So three more carts come by and we get food items. Each time I'm asking for sriracha  or sweet and sour sauce and each time they tell me to ask my waiter. Wish I knew who that was because no one has showed and I still haven't gotten a drink. Finally I grab someone running by and they bring us some water. Still no sauces. In fact one girl I grab has no clue what sriracha even is. Finally someone brings some hot sauce and some other sweet and sour.   At this point I get a work call on the cell so I walk out the door to take the call. Luckily my work date paid for the food and took it to go or I probably wouldn't have gone back in.  End of story, do not go to this place under any circumstance. Horrible service won't even let you get to the point if the food is any good. First and last visit in one.",

No one bothered to ask us for drinks, we ordered egg rolls, and a type of bread. What we ordered was good, but the lack of respect was just too much for me and boyfriend so we just decided to leave. We paid, the cashier charged us for drinks when we told her no one served us anything. She turned her back while we were talking to her, I've never been this disrespected in my life. We will not be coming back, they need to work on their customer service, if I could give this place a zero I would, me and my boyfriend just laughed about it in the car after, but damn.

The restaurant is huge. It was busy the entire time we were there. Many of the patrons were Asian which in my opinion is always a very good sign when dinning in an oriental restaurant. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I think we had 5 different people serving us.   I went to try the walnut shrimp with mayonnaise. Some call it crystal shrimp others mayonnaise shrimp. One of my fellow yelpers had mentioned it was her favorite here. So I had to try it out. Well it was ok, the walnuts were odd almost praline. The shrimp seemed on the verge of being undercooked and a couple of the shrimp were not cleaned well. That just stopped me in my tracks and I couldn't finish. I guess I have been spoiled by my beloved Gina (Big Wong) her walnut shrimp with mayonnaise was incredible!   We also tried the fried rice and was not impressed here either it was very bland no flavor at all. They served a mountain of it but it just didn't have any taste to it. The egg rolls were crisp yet greasy, they were small and the inside was mush almost liquefied. My friend experienced the same problem with her dish under seasoned.   It was a little like dinning in an Asian old folk's home; you know no salt everything bland, edible just not appetizing. : ) I really wanted to like this place. I will not be back.",

We were certainly among only a handful of non-chinese speakers and some of the employees tended to avoid us because of the language problem.  Had only a few different Dim-Sum plates.  A few bun things that were ok (sparse filling).  A few egg rolls (Shrimp only and my dining partner doesn't like exoskeletal creatures).  Shumai were tasty.

Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go.  I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.  Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.  As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try.  The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen.  I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself.  The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.  Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price.  If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to.  There are still so many more dishes to try as well, but that will be for another trip.",

Typically, I go to Golden Buddha in the Chinese Cultural center, but I was recommended that Great Wall has better dim sum.   Please keep in mind that I admit, I went during the end of the rush (1:00pm) on a Sunday so I had appropriate expectations. However, there was only 2 carts going around trying to sell their leftovers from the rush and was really disappointed. We ordered the chicken feet, pork bun, hak-kwah, bok choy and it was just okay. In fact, I would have to say it was quite bland and the sauce on some of the dishes were salty and tasteless. The chicken feet I usually get is cut into pieces and not battered but the way they served it at the Great Wall, compromised my gag reflex. I am not one to be shy of eating different parts of animals, in fact ox tail is one of my favorite meat but my stomach could not handle their chicken feet.   I would assume we would have received better service and tastier food if we had gotten there a little earlier but I think I am going to stick with my usual place. Flagging the carts down continuously was a little more stressful than what I want when eating dim sum.",

I had this delicious shrimp and pork dumpling, sweet bean cakes etc and Chrysanthemum Tea! It was really wonderful and the veggies were so green and fresh--yumm, would certainly like to try it again if we get a very big party together.  Beware! It's in the ghetto and Chinese / Asian service and crowds might get to you if you are used to Western fare. The Chinese / American people love it though--there were tons.",

I will start....as always, by saying I am the pickiest person I know and although food is a preference.... I know what I like!   We went on a Saturday around noon and it was packed!  There were several larger tables open but nothing to accomodate 2 people so being the outgoing person I am, I invited a couple people to join us so we could take a larger table.  What a great way to meet people, and they were great tablemates!  The food is good, I only have a couple CONS....  No low sodium soy sauce and most of the food is VERY salty!  The selection is not great, no calamari or bbq pork and several other items I enjoy.  The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet,,, their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse. (bummer) and the owner just doesnt seem to care.  If you enjoy Dim Sum...I reccomend you give it a shot and see what you think.  And until then.............  Bon Appetite'",

    "text": "Dim Sum on a busy Saturday.  I have been to C-Fu, China King, MeKong Palace, and Phoenix Palace.  Unfortunately, this is my least favorite place.  The Dim Sum is not fresh (except the dumplings in the tin covers, and these were mediocre at best), and a lot of it was greasy (deep fried).  What a pity considering all the rave reviews on this site.  The eggplant with the shrimp on top was old.   We tried the deep fried soft shell crab, and this was greasy and salty, the deep fried egg rolls with shrimp; again greasy and cold.  Even the Chinese broccoli was old and over sauced.  There was one shinning dish:  the tripe was delicious.  Overall, much better food quality at other places.  I hated to say this as I really wanted to like this place, but it is what it is...very mediocre",

I can't eat shell fish so this place would be perfect for lobster and crab lovers because it is one of their main dish! I usually come here for dim sum too! The ladies that push the cart are really attentive. The price is just right! I came here the day after thanksgiving with a party of 12? The bill came out to be less than 80 dollars during dim sum hours. MUST TRY THIS PLACE. However, the one thing I don't like is, they don't ever bring enough water for everyone at the table and that they don't give us the yummy saute oil spicy peppers. We always go up and get it ourselves.",

This didn't realy bother me because it likely meant that the place was legit.  I never see a chinese restaurant with a wait.  Also large asian population of patrons which is also a good sign.  This was only the second time I had experienced dim sum.  It was an awesome experience and everything I had was soooo good, even though most of what I put into my mouth I had no idea what I was eating.  Didn't care.  This place is fantastic and I can't wait to come back and try more things or even their takeout menu.  Most authentic chinese food I've found in AZ thus far.",

    "text": "Maybe it's a medical student thing, but I've been hearing about dim sum at Great Wall since shortly after I started school here in AZ.  This was my first experience with it and, after all I heard, I wasn't unimpressed.  When you show up somewhere on an off night and there's still a wait of around 20 minutes, you know that something delicious is inside.  From the moment my group and I were seated at one of the huge round tables inside, foodstuffs of all sorts kept appearing on our table.  I have almost no recollection of the various things my palate was treated to during the course of that meal, but I know I enjoyed pretty much everything on the carts that we pointed to and said \"I'll try that\".  So why only 3 stars?  The biggest reason was simply that I felt it wasn't worth what was paid for it.  There were 5 people at our table, True, but I still remember looking at the bill and wondering just how expensive each of those little tins were.  On top of that, nothing stood out as at all noteworthy.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was strikingly good either.  It was a big filling meal of better-than-generic asian cuisine.  Worth going to again, but I'm not running.",

I'm an extremely picky eater and coming from San Diego, I must say that this restaurant didn't disappoint me. It's busy every time I'm there, what I like the most about it is the quality is consistent. The Dim Sum is mediocre, it seems as though they add too much MSG nowadays.

They have a wide variety of dishes to choose from. And I must admit that it would be helpful to go with an experienced 'Dim-Sum-er' because some of the dishes can be intimidating! I don't eat any meat except fish, and they had plenty of delish options for me. The broccoli, noodle, tofu, and sesame balls are by far my favorites.  They can get really crowded, as both times I was there (Saturday and Sunday), they were packed. Plenty of parking in the lot, though. The inside is massive and nicely decorated. I never made a trip to the restroom, but I did hear that they are very nice too. :-P Each time I've been there, all 4 of usl left completely stuffed, and we each spent about $12 for the food we shared.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to the Great Wall in YEARS! My husband planned an outing for Dim Sum for my birthday. We've talked about doing this for some time but we finally planned ahead, had the time and found a restaurant that serves Dim Sum.    Before deciding where we should go he asked a student, who is Chinese, where his family preferred to eat Dim Sum. The recommendation was the Great Wall. It was a drive for us but so worth it!  Reading some of the reviews here, and having mentioned our impending outing to a friend who has frequented the Great Wall, I was a bit apprehensive, but I am adventurous by nature and willing to try it. If it didn't work out as hoped all we would lose is a bit of time and money.  If you're into a well-mannered, quiet dining experience this probably isn't the place for you.  If you don't mind a bit of noisy conversation, you're adventurous and willing to try just about anything once, you'll love the Great Wall.   Loads of carts come by with a variety of items. Some of them we knew what to expect and others we tried.  Again, you have to be a bit adventurous.  We asked one gentleman what he had in his cart (it had trays with lids). His English was a bit broken but we determined that he had tripe. Now I'm not a fan but I did try a piece. My husband, on the other hand, loved it. He ate almost the entire serving (quite a lot actually) by himself.   The pot stickers were enormous and so delicious. We tried noodles (pretty basic), great shrimp dumplings, noodles, wonderful yeast buns filled with almond paste, and too many other things to remember.  We were thrilled to see so many families (many of them Chinese) dining together.  Obviously this is a go-to location for family gatherings. Even though we went on one of the hottest days of the year, there was a line by the time we left around 12:30 pm.   One website about Dim Sum Etiquette recommends that you have a group of three or more so you can enjoy many different items. If we can find another three or four people who are willing to take a chance to try new things we'll be back soon! If not, we'll be sure to arrive early, with empty stomachs ready to eat!",

So for the last week or so it's (haha, proper use of the apostrophe, bitches) been ramen noodles, rice, ramen noodles, peanut butter, and ramen noodles.   I've been trying to make the most of it. I look up ramen recipes on the internet. I make aesthetically pleasing bentos out of them. I even put pictures of my lunch on my livejournal, perhaps to maintain the illusion that I'm \"challenging myself\" rather than desperately clinging to the edge of poverty.  Alas, no how I try to psyche myself, there is no pick me up for the buzz kill one experiences when eating 15 cent noodles in front of your computer when your stomach and smug sense of culture are screaming for something...more...  Like dim sum. Like Great Wall's dim sum.  This morning I was stewing another batch of \"failure food\" when the insane craving for dim sum hit me like homosexual tendencies striking a fundamentalist preacher giving a sermon on how G*d hates Rastafarians.  On the outside, Great Wall looks like another two-bit strip mall attraction. You know, like all the stores next to it. But inside it's like the dining room of Hotel Awesome, where somewhat discontent-looking servers push around carts of delicious and deliver plates of FUCK YEAH to your table where you and your party can divvy them up/fight over them. Whatever fits your interpretation of Darwinism.  To be honest I'm surprised more people don't fight over the food.  For a mound of their delicious lo mein I would probably break a chair over someone's face.   For a plate of their pork buns I would falcon punch someone in front of their kids.  This may seem a little aggressive...but it can be a fucking battle royale in there.  Especially when you don't have anyone in your party who speaks the language.  \"Uh, yes, I'll take some of that, no, that, yes the thing with the shrimp in it. Oh, and some of that, too. No. To the right. Yes. Oh shit, where'd our ticket go?\"  I remember watching a Muppet Babies episode once where the children were eating gruel or something and they suggested trying to imagine it as something tastier.  I tried that. It's a lot harder than it looks.  You swirl those nickel-and-dime noodles around on your fork and you try to imagine crab puffs or plates of peppered shrimp or mango pudding.  You try to imagine being surrounded by all your friends, plus some people you've just met, plus a whole restaurant of people speaking in their cafeteria voices (i.e. screaming at the top of their lungs).  And then you open your eyes and take a bite.  And you realize that you're alone in front of your computer screen with a mouth full of chopstick because in your daydreaming you drop your ramen all over yourself.   Fuck.  I would crash a mini-motorcycle into someone's groin right now for a plate of their lumpia or shrimp dumplings.  Dammit.  Does anyone need someone to paint their nails and take them out shopping?   I can't keep living like this.",

    "text": "After having eaten at Golden Buddha, China King, C-Fu, and China Chan, I have to say that Great Wall is probably the best place to get dimsum in the Valley.   China Chan comes a close second with better har gau and egg tarts.  The Chinese New Year special dimsum - pig trotters with black moss - was delicious.  Apparently it's super labor intensive so is only offered for a limited time.  The shiu mai, steamed tripe and spare ribs were cooked and seasoned just right.  The taro puff had great taro flavor and tasty filling with only a hint of oil.  The har gau skin unfortunately fell apart and the egg tart crust was not as flaky as China Chan's.  Overall, the flavors were good, fresh and a nice variety to choose from.",

    "text": "I had a horrible time there. I have been to many Dim Sum and this place is horrible. On Sunday they opened at 9:00 o'clock, we got there around 1:00. None of the food were ready to be served. People were still vacuuming and cleaning the restaurant. When I am eating, I Don't want people to be mopping the floor and vacuuming near me because who knows what can get on my food. Also there was buckets of dirty water near us and near the bar. It was just disgusting to look at. The vacuum was super loud and all the employees were everywhere, not really doing anything productive, just standing around. They had about 4 dishes ready and in a very limited amount too. When we asked if there was more food, the lady said we had to go to the bar place and order...(what??). Last time I checked,  a Diem Sum is awesome and special because people roll a cart of food around and we get to pick. I guess I was mistaken. Also, the lady was very rude, I understand that she is trying to push out orders or whatever but being rude to your customers is not the way to go. We ordered the chicken feet and still didn't received around an hour later. When we did see the chicken feet, it was going out to the other tables that went in after us. We had to remind them that we ordered like an hour ago. They said \"oh\" and gave the chicken feet to us. We ordered a few thing to go and it didn't come out right. We ordered two part chicken feet, one came out AND the lady tipped a plate over at our table causing the sauce to spill all over. She was also very rude about it when we told her that there was only one part chicken. After we were finishing up our food (yes the to go's boxes came about an hour early), she came up and said \"there's more chicken feet, want some?\" In Vietnamese. Now if she was speaking English to us and she doesn't speak it fluently then we would understand but she speaks fluent Vietnamese. The way she was talking to us were like we were dogs. It was very frustrating. Additionally, our table wasn't the only table that was just sitting there with wondering eyes. 2-3 more tables before and after us were just sitting there waiting looking around trying to eat some air to push down their hunger. I walked out of that restaurant extremely unsatisfied and still hungry! (There was such a limit of items that we can eat that we just asked for our check). If I can give 0 star, I would.",

You'll get nothing out of the ordinary with Great Wall Cuisine - a few dim sum carts with your standard fare, an outdated banquet hall, and subpar service.  But even that, I can deal with, because I live in PHX and there's like, two places that serves dim sum.  What I can't get with is charging TWENTY dollars for pea shoots.  Are you kidding me????  But I guess it's my fault for ordering off the menu, right?  My fault for assuming that there's no way they'd charge more than ten bucks for sauteed veggies at an old school Chinese restaurant in a deserted strip mall.  SILLY ME!!

After we were seated, we chose the fried squid, fried shrimp with sugar cane, and sticky rice from the dimsum cart. They were stone cold and hard. The manager's response was \"it is dimsum; it goes around the room.\" It only told me that the turnover was not high on certain foods and yet they chose to prepare them anyway and serve them after they are past acceptable. I have had dimsum in other cities and have NEVER had cold food that was supposed to be hot, dimsum cart or not. Just to be fair, the siomai, gai lan and jellyfish were okay. They were tasty and were the acceptable temperature for food going around a large room in a cart. That's the one star you earned. The noodles? It would have been nice if you added a few vegetables aside from the onions.  As for the service, it was fine. Our server was a sweet older lady who was very helpful and attentive. That is the second and final star you are getting from me.  Sad. Where else do we go for dimsum in Arizona? I suppose I will wait until I am out of town where they have real dimsum fare as I will be hardpressed to return here.",

The cart people always look unhappy. I went today and they didn't even have shu mai and the shrimp dumplings which is the most popular. The server didn't even care, all he said was that they don't have anymore at all. If they don't have it anymore then why don't they make it?! It was only 1pm and dim sum ends at 3pm. I also asked for turnip cake and they said there's no more too. I came hungry and left hungry. Their BBQ pork buns were barely filled with any pork. What a disappointing experience. When I moved to the west side of Arizona, this was the only dim sum place nearby. If you live on the west side, I would highly recommend Phoenix palace instead located in Chandler even though it's further away. Their customer service and dim sum is far better in quality. I will never go to Great Wall again for dim sum.",

The only thing we get now is the BBQ bun and even that one is fading. Maybe just our taste buds but pls try it out. They really had us for more than 4 yrs. Might need to stay away for awhile and then come back after few months.   :) still like there dimsum. A bit pricey but its the only dim sum I know near phx area.  Update: the flavor is degrading a bit. Their usual spicy pork chop just got erased from our to go. It's so salty now.   Also this came to my mind the pink slip. I think it would be nice if they put a English version of that paper that they come and check every time you order something. Wouldn't that be nice?",

I'm so glad they reopened after their fire a few years ago, those were tough times, had to go all the way downtown to the chinese cultural center & then you have to brave parking, for dim sum that was merely comparable.  The staff aren't real friendly, many speak little english & aren't impressed with my feeble attempts at what chinese I recall, the owner/manager was more friendly years ago, I think she's kind of burnt out & doesn't seem to care, certainly not as enthusiastic a reception as in bygone years, but the food makes it definitely worth it. The dim sum offered isn't as extensive on the weekdays, but at least you can get an early lunch fix; after 1 the pickings slim, & at best only the main contenders. Weekends is where it's at, but there's always quite a wait, & if you want egg custard tarts for desert you best be there early.   Hot tip: you can order ahead & take-out - great when you have out of town guests HOWEVER always carefully check that you received everything you ordered & paid for before you leave, especially the bigger your order is, because there's no going back. Even after nearly a decade as a loyal customer, it's like oh well, so sorry, have a nice day, better luck next time. If you're lucky they'll tell you they ran out of something you ordered, & not charge you for it.",

    "text": "I've been here probably about 5 times. Some of the occasions were for lunch, dinner, or for a wedding. Great Wall looks small outside, but when you walk in it is a pretty big restaurant. When I came here for a wedding it was very decorative and the menu if already set up for you. It was an Asian wedding and some of the food that came out for the guests included soup, seafood, fried rice, and dessert. Coming here for lunch is much different. It is not as busy as a wedding would be of course and mostly you see big groups there such as a family. Every entree is family style so we basically all just ordered and shared the food within our party. Food is always delicious and tasty there. I think I just barely come here because I live on the other side of town.   Now, for that Saturday we came here for dim sum. It was my first time here for dim sum, but I heard great things about Great Wall. As we drove into the parking lot it was already full. The wait was maybe about 20-30 minutes for us and looking inside it was pretty packed. So, I thought wow, maybe this place is all the hype. Once we got seated we got shumai (I think that's how you spell it). It's a pork dumpling. We also ordered chicken wings, shrimp dumplings, chow mein noodles, and chicken feet! I know a lot of people that may be unappealing, but the chicken feet was very good. I loved it!   Overall, I can always recommend this place because I basically enjoy the food they have here. I would say when I had the best tasting of  food was during the time I came here for a wedding. The next best is during the time they serve dim sum, but as stated above it does get busy so coming here early would be the best thing if you do not want to wait. Staff was good, but we did keep seeing the same person with the same cart of food like 5 times. It sucks that its a pretty far drive for me to get here or else I'd be over here all the time for dim sum. So, on that note I will definitely be back here again for dim sum and if you NEVER tried or experience it, mine as well get to Great Wall and try it!",

    "text": "It's sad to see one of the great wonders of the world be demoted to serving Dim Sum on the weekends. I've got to admit, when they said you could see this thing from outer space, I really expected it to be a bit bigger. It looks a lot different than in Disney's Mulan, but I guess that's 'cause Disney likes to bend the truth sometimes.  I am Chinese, so I was excited to hear other Chinese people speaking in Mandarin at the restaurant. It put me in the mood to start speaking it myself. I soon found out that if you order in Chinese, you actually get exactly 0% off your bill. Many Bothans died to bring us this information.  Some of the individual entree dishes come with rice included. It always fascinated me how the culture that ate the most rice decided to use two sticks as utensils. Literally any other combination of staple food item and utensil would have been more appropriate.  Just thinking about all the salty, greasy, Chinese food is making my mouth feel dry and my stomach quiver in fear. That being said, I'll probably go this weekend because it's the best Chinese food around.  Cheerio!",

So you know they must be doing something right.  Personally, it's not my favorite place for dim sum.  Their chinese broccoli was better than at other places, but some of their other dishes like shumai, sesame balls with fig filling, were not as good as I've had elsewhere.  Also, the inside is crammed!  Table are jam packed next to each other and I had to squeeeeeze in to get to my seat.  Yikes, you won't want to come here if you're claustrophobic and pretty sure the arrangement of their tables breaks some kind of fire code bc if I had wanted to get out of there fast, I couldn't have.  But, this place will still hit the spot if you're craving dim sum so I wish them the best and hope they stay in business so I can visit if I'm ever on that side of town again!  Note, we came at 10 am on a Saturday and there was no wait. but by 11 there was a long line!  so get there early.",

A texture I'm not particularly fond of, but flavor good. Lo mein type noodles--good Duck-good, despite not a lot of meat Twice fried pork, really good. Chicken wings-really good ( not really Asian or Chinese but I really like crispy wings) Shrimp shumai really good Greens-i think they were some sort of asian broccoli.  My favorite things were the tea, sesame ball with sweet filling and shumai.  Con's,:  way too busy and crowded but there's nothing you can do about that. That's just the way dim sum is  I don't like getting passed up by anyone with the carts. Some don't speak any English so you don't know what they are offering and combine that with the din and the language barrier, it got a little frustrating.   Prices- no clue.  I love Asian food and rarely get anything good in the valley so this is quite good. I will go again",

Although the food is good, the service is inconsistently. Be aware that you may have to chase one of the servers down to order your food if you want something beside the dim sum. You don't actually have one server, the servers help whoever they want. So, you must be aggressive and maybe even rude to get what you want. The dim sum carts take a long time coming around, because the restaurant is always busy, especially on Christmas day. The food, again, is good overall. Prices are very inexpensive, but it does add up. While waiting for the dim sum carts to come around, you should grab one of their paper menus and order something from there. They have lunch specials during 11 am-3 pm, which consists of the average and the usual rice dishes. I recommend trying their hot jasmine tea! So good!!!",

I was hoping she might have just been biased, but unfortunately I had to agree. While I didn't notice anything dirty (though the place wasn't exactly spotless), I felt the same about Mekong.  The wait here was quite long, though most dim sum places are like that. We started out with the  (crispy roast duck) and BBQ pork. I looove roast duck but sadly was incredibly disappointed with this. It was cold from sitting in the cart (as was the pork), far from crispy, and bland to top it off. Inexcusable for the price of the duck. They were so unappetizing that we didn't even finish them, though I was able to salvage them later for some leftover fried rice when meal prepping for the week.  The  (sticky rice in banana leaves with meat filling) was alright but tasted a bit off, and the shumai was decent.  The staff was nice enough, and the prices weren't outrageous, but the food is definitely not worth coming for. While I'm not aware of any dim sum places in Phoenix worth raving over (please let me know if you find one), I would stick to Mekong to satisfy your dim sum cravings.",

I'm glad I went with a friend who is familiar with dim sum as she was able to make recommendations for which items to grab and which ones to skip.   Basically, the staff circles around the restaurant with carts loaded up with food. They stop by at each table and you tell them what you want and they'll mark a card to keep track of what you're ordering. These carts of food are coming around pretty much non-stop so don't get over zealous and grab things as they come to you.   We had a variety of things (sorry I don't know their names) including duck, dumplings, noodles, and several of their sweeter plates. Everything was flavorful and warm as it got to our table. This is definitely a place to check out!",

The services are fairly good, sometimes you can not just wait, need to go ask some food from the Dim Sum cart, which is understandable since they are so busy. Not sure how many years it has been there, the food taste has not changed, which is really a good sign comparing to some \"fancy\" Chinese restaurants that disappeared in few years.  The atmosphere is very traditional like, noisy and crowded, feels like you are in Hong Kong or Guangdong,  a good place for homesick people in the desert.",

Fried rice was decent, egg flower soup was decent but I think most people prefer it a bit thicker and not watery.   Sweet and sour pork was good but the dinner combo only has five pieces.  Chicken chow me in was alright, just wish they didn't use so much MSG you can taste it more than the protein in the dish.

I think it's in a bit of a rough area. I've also been to quite a few dinners here, which I prefer.... For hot pots and salt and pepper crab. Also, the walnut shrimp, that is extra heavy on mayo, and well..... I could eat that for days.  They also have good tea. I remember some weird white flower tea that I really like.  They have a lot of events here (wedding receptions) I've been once or twice on Saturdays when they don't allow the public in, so try and call before hand or waste a drive all the way over there!",

Banquet meals or family style dinners I've had countless times and they have options for everyone. If I weren't so far away in the east valley id be here more often.  Service can be choppy but if you know how to take the system or have a little patience you will be rewarded greatly.",

I got the Pecking Pork Chops (BOMB!) and it came with rice. They where crunchy but juicy and  meaty, a very big portion by the way. My girlfriend had the Walnut Shrimp (BOMB!) and we also ordered the 6 meat dumplings.   Can't wait to go back back and try the rest of the stuff. I will definitely recommend to anyone looking for good Cantonese food. Thank you staff!",

For dim sum, I would only recommend to go during the weekends. If you go during the week, food doesn't taste as fresh and they don't have much dim sum item on the cart either. For dinner, you can go anytime. We ordered lobster and crabs, but it all look small compare to what they said its 3lbs lobster. The lobster and crab meat looks dried and tiny. Other foods tasted delicious and well seasoned.  I would go here only if my family wanted to or if I wanted to go for dim sum on the weekends.",

Growing up, my family had dim sum every weekend so dim sum is not new to me and I've eaten at many dim sum restaurants.  1 star each is deducted for the quality and cost.  The cost is pretty high for mediocre dim sum.  They do have a huge variety and they come around in their carts.  I do like that they make their buns fresh.  1 star is deducted for my experience as a Chinese person in this restaurant.  I noticed that the non-Asians were seated in the middle of the restaurant which is prime seating as that's where the carts go to first while the Chinese were sitting at the edge.  The cart makes their way around a path and always start at the same path which means those sitting at the end is always getting last pick.  I recommend the staff to switch up their cart routes.  I also noticed that the non Asians were getting better service than the Asians.  Carts passed my table 3x without asking us if we wanted anything while the tables around us who were not Asian were asked every single time.  I cannot say this prejudice came from every staff member but I felt it from some.  I hope that the restaurant trains the staff to treat every customer equally.",

The Great Wall is a good place for central Phoenix (I can't really speak for their non dim sum fair).       -- READ FURTHER FOR A BEGINNERS GUIDE --  If you've never been graced by dim sum, then...  Beginners Guide(from an equal amateur): Dim Sum, a Cantonese brunch(intended for breakfast) offering various bite-sized delicacies which are carted past your table in a procession of selections.   As a prototypical American, that had yet to be graced by these mainly savory selections until a few years back, I know the intimidation of the unknown and the risk of the learning curve towards possibly picking the \"wrong\" food.  For the uninitiated, it's hard to mess dim sum up at a place like this. But, be prepared to wait for a table on weekends. Once your lucky number is called, take your seat, ask for a tiny bowl of chili paste to mix with soy sauce and you are off to the races as the carts roll by. Don't be afraid to ask what's hidden beneath the trays!   First timer? I'd recommend starting with Sui Mai (\"Sue-My\"), Har Gau (\"hah-cow\" or shrimp dumpling), beef flat noodles(not your typical noodle), spare ribs, crispy roast pork(pork belly), and crispy roast duck (if it looks fresh). If you want something green... the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce is delectable. And coconut filled buns or sesame balls are a great way to add a touch of sweetness to finish it all off.  If your looking for a great breakfast/lunch at extremely affordable prices, this is the place! My wife, son and I eat as much as we can and still leave for $30 or less.  If you're a more experienced dim summer, please add your input, corrections or recommendations for the best experience! Thanks and enjoy!",

It's not uncommon to see the servers have a meal all together during hours of operation, if that happens you're screwed.    When I say they cook with no heart I mean it. For example if you order two chicken plates you get the same chicken prepared in the same way just with a different sauce it's like they perfected the assembly line for restaurants. Everything is prepped and ready made they take the chicken what seems to be steamed use it over and over  the positive is that the food comes out literally in 5 minutes.   When your in the mood for just okay food that comes out fast this is is the place the food isn't bad it's just okay.",

Eventhough it's not the most romantic setting and it's even in a very ghetto area, everyone knows a good wedding involves good food. At least for us Asians.    Now that we live on the East side, we don't go here as often but do visit whenever we can.  Our most recent visit was yesterday and we ordered our usual Fish Maw Soup and Crispy Seafood Chowmein noodles.  Eventhough it's still better than most restaurants, I felt like the taste is not as good as before and also the price has gone up substantially.  I heard that they had replaced the cook so that may have been why.  Anyhow, its still a pretty good place for gatherings and we've had many good memories here.  We will definitely come back whenever we are in the area.   Also check out their dim sums, usually a long line out the door on weekends.",

I'm from the NYC area, where there are plenty of fantastic authentic Chinese restaurants.  I wasn't expecting to find much, if any, good Chinese restaurants here while I was visiting family.  Fortunately, Great Wall was actually quite good.  Certainly not the best dim sum or Cantonese food I've ever had, but for what I was expecting, I was impressed.  Dim sum appears to be really popular at this place.  I came on a weekday at 11:15am and was surprised to see a pretty decent crowd already.  The dim sum is served in the traditional carts that get push around the restaurant from table to table.  You'll find most of the common dim sum items at this place.    For dinner, I've had a bunch of typical Cantonese dishes here - ginger/scallion lobster, steamed fish, beef brisket hot pot bowl, peking pork chops, stir-fry Chinese greens, etc.  Most of them are generally on point in terms of flavor and quality of ingredients.",

I have been here for dinner before on a few occasions, and the family style food options for dinner are okay at best. However this should not take away from the fact that their dim sum is absolutely delicious and that is this restaurant's redeeming quality.  They do dimsum everyday, from opening until 2-3PM (Not sure which one it is, but I'd say until 2 just to be safe. While they open at 11AM on the weekdays, it's best to go early on Sundays when they open at 9AM because it seems like their dimsum menu is a little bit more expanded on the weekends.  In terms of price it is not all that expensive. When I eat here by myself I generally spend $15-20. When I come in a group of 3-4 people, we generally spend $60-80. Compared to other dimsum restaurants, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, Great Wall's prices for dim sum is a bit lower. So the quality and taste of the various items, as well as the low price just can't be beat.",

We were seated pretty quickly and handed down the menus. After that our server didn't appear. So, we had to signal some another server to take our order.   Mapu tofu, pork dumplings, and spicy pork chop. These were our orders.None of the food items wowed us. I mean with all that positive reviews, I had high expectations, but the food disappointed. I feel the food tasted below average.   Next, the customer service was  extremely POOR. We had two different servers. One who took orders and the other served. None of them cared to check on us, not even once.   Another thing that was really not fitting to the dinning experience is that there was some kind of event happening on the other half of the area. It  was noisy and the servers seemed to be busy entertaining guests of that event.   In summary, below average food, poor customer service, and dirty utensils/ greasy floors. We left disappointed and completely ignored as customers. Value of money spent was zero. So, one star.",

I've been here many years ago, but don't live in Phoenix, so I don't get to come here regularly.  Needless to say the Sun crowd is large and you will have to wait for seating unless you come about 1 hour to closing...  After about a 40 minute wait, we were seated and there was still a good size selection.  We got basically the standards.  Now, something that I was not use to seeing was Chow Fun roll around, granted it was plain (no meat), but it still was nice to have.  I will admit, the har gow and siu mai were not as good as other places I have had, like Mekong.  Their Shrimp Cheung Fun was pretty good here.  They also offered some dishes that I have not seen at other locations, even some Cali ones... like salt & pepper wings.  Personally, I don't eat the cocktail buns (Gai Meh Bow), but I hear it's the best in town and they must be popular, because I saw trays of it come out.  Again, this place has been around for many years serving Dim Sum and they are good and I wouldn't mind coming out when given the opportunity.  They do offer a limited Dim Sum menu during the weekdays, but best if you can wait until a weekend to get the full experience and menu.",

I have been here plenty of times already because the food is great, but I am putting three stars because although their food is good, some of their servers are just rude. Being in the customer service industry, I believe that each person should have a slight friendliness vibe, but some people there seem like they really don't like what they do.  Update from three stars to two stars:  Came in for dinner on a Sunday night, we got seated right away, but man oh man took 25 minutes before someone actually took our order. We had to flag someone down to take it for us, and then in top of that, the food took a while to get to us. They should really have a better system, and hire more chefs if needed if they know they are going to be busy on a weekend.",

Depends on who you get and what mood they are in that day. LOL Get up and get your own chili oil. Get up and get ur own Togo boxes if needed. Smiling and being nice and polite is not gonna work but be nice anyways. You are there for the food and NOT the service. Lol   Will be back bc I love dim sum!",

I've been a customer here for more than 19 years and I can count on one hand the number of times I've been disappointed with their food. Let's get to the thick of it:  1. Chairs are armless and will comfortably hold my obese body. There's plenty of room to maneuver between tables if you request a table situated on the aisles.   2. There are TWO menus - one for group/family meals. The menu is catered to an American customer and staff can be very hesitant to share with non-Asians. If you want authentic food and not the same old sweet and sour, boring beef and broccoli, then out your foot down and ask for the pink menu.   3. The Dim Sum selections are matchless to anywhere in the Valley. There is NOTHING American about Dim Sum!  They bring the food around on trays and you choose and chew. Try something new! It's what makes dining out so fun, right? Dim Sum ends at 2:30 each day with the weekends having long wait times.   4. Bring your young kids and let them visit the half dozen fish tanks containing all kinds of live seafood.",

When dining there during the week (for dim sum) I usually order something off the regular menu.    Everything is great, but my favorites are definitely the shrimp dumplings and shu mai.  You must try everything though!    Every time I have been in Great Wall, its busy.  Weekends especially, you should plan on waiting about 30 minutes depending on how many people are in your party.  Speaking of party size, the larger your party, the better the experience.  Its hard to try all of their delicious offerings with just a couple of people.  Great Wall is also open very late!  Midnight on weekends, but dim sum is only available for lunch!  Enjoy!",

It's her favourite, most of the workers know her too.    The restaurant was clean, well kept, well decorated, plenty of seating, and quite furnished.  The staff were super friendly, attentive, very sociable and has excellent patience especially dealing with some of the family members.  XD service was fast, didn't really have to wait long for the food to come out.  The food was decent in taste, but still have room for improvement.  We ordered a bunch of stuff, from fish, to tofu, greens and mushrooms, chicken and duck.  The price is a bit high, not really worth the value, but it's okay.    The loo was quite clean, and looked great.  The toilet was a little weaker than a common house toilet, not sure if it was broken.  A fine toilet is like the ocean.... It crashes and splashes hard and leave no floaters a float.  They had adequate amount of toilet paper too, so use the loo with peace of mind.  Overall a great experience, if you're into the more traditional Chinese food, this place is for you!  I don't see why I wouldn't be back.  They have a good dim sum too, if you're into that brunch stuff.",

Since I know nothing about dim sum, all I can do is share my overall general biased by my own narrow existence perception of the place.  So here it goes.  As usual, Mr. K has accurately described and captured the essence of this restaurant in his review, so there's that.  Read his review.  What I can add is this.  The food all tasted good to me.  The atmosphere was fun and lively.  The demo is certainly nothing like any place I've ever been to in Phoenix, so those who decry the lack of diversity in this town, perhaps you just need to expand your horizons to include Great Wall into your rotation. And I would go back.  I have to get on the HIGHWAY to drive here, so that is saying a lot.  For those of you who are directionally challenged, it's the first shopping plaza on the east side of 35th Avenue, just north of Camelback.      *It's been years and years and years since high school English.  For some reason I think this means \"blank slate.\"  If not strike \"tableau rosa\" and insert \"blank slate\" above.",

(note to those not familiar with dim sum - go with a medium sized group, about 4-6 people).  the dim sum is decent and not shockingly, a bit greasy.   recommended dishes: ha gao (shrimp dumpling), siu mai (pork/shrimp dumpling), steamed cha siu bao (a bbq pork bun), cha siu or shrimp cheung fun (bbq pork or shrimp wrapped in steamed wide, flat rice noodles), gai lan (chinese dark green vegetable), don tot (egg custard tart), lo-bak-go (pan friend turnip cake), and the steamed black bean spare ribs. the calamari is pretty good here, and they have pan friend shrimp/chive dumplings, which are my fave.   it's always loud and crowded here on the weekends. and it's typical chinese service - always annoyed, and slightly ignoring you ;) so get here early, or come towards closing - although you will likely have slim pickings for food the later you come.  and please, please, PLEASE stay in your freakin' seat, people! last time i came, people were following the carts around with their bills. they will come to you. just stay seated, sheesh.",

We had a group of four and waited about 30 minutes to be seated.  I have no problem waiting, especially for good food and service, but there is no waiting lobby at this restaurant, just a small crowded area by the front door which was hot and you had to stand shoulder to shoulder.  When we were seated, we were offered drinks right away, but that's where the service ended.  If took forever for the first cart to make it by our table and that was only pastries and deserts.   Other carts were circulating loaded with dim sum but they never made it our table.   When they came close, they went flying by our table and would not stop. Gesturing and waiving was to no avail.  It was like we were invisible. When a cart did finally stop, we selected two or three items which were good but that was pretty much it.  From then on, it was always the same woman with the same items.  When we asked the servers to bring more selections they acted put out and never obliged us until a Chinese person in our group had to get up and track down a manager type.  Even then it took forever and the selection that was brought was poor.  I would not recommend this Restaurant to any one.  There are other choices for Dim Sum in the Valley.  Choose one of them.",

It is a popular place for wedding banquets among the Chinese community of PHX, and can get quite loud when one of those events is taking place.  As with most Chinese restaurants, the best meals are on the Chinese menu, not the English menu.  A freind who reads Chinese turned us on to the set meal #1 on the Chinese menu, which is what we order almost every time we go there now!  It is very reasonably priced and with a famly of 4 you will probably be taking some of it home.",

The only possible downsides are that the dim sum is not a place for vegetarians.  Also, an Asian friend of mine was a little bothered that all the servers directed their questions to her and kind of ignored me and another white girl.  I blew it off because that was par for the course in Japan and I'm used to it.  It's not worth fussing about when the food is so good. :)",

Portions are relatively large compared to other dim sum places, eg pineapple buns are 3 to a dish and large, similar to bakery size.  Chow mein is given on heaping 6 inch high mounds.  Har gow, siu mai are good.  The salt pepper squid looked good.  Sesame balls were excellent and had mung bean fillings.  Phoenix claws were also excellent.   Overall, this was a very good place to take family to.   Now, compared to California dim sum places this would only be an average place but because I don't have to drive six hours to California and the quality is good, I give this place 4 stars.  Prices are excellent and actually cheaper than many other dim sum places.  Excellent value and great portions will fill up any large family.",

As far as dim sum goes, Great Wall is one of the best you'll find in Phoenix; it ain't the rain, but it's good water.  They have a line-up if you're not there early (a good sign), serve all the basic dim sum dishes using the traditional cart service.  Not the best dim sum I've ever had - but then, I've had dim sum worldwide - but certainly good considering this is the desert.  Within Phoenix I'd give it a 5 star, but my rating system is based on what I've tried worldwide in my many travels - so only 4 stars.  If you're in Phoenix and looking for Dim Sum, this is one of the few good watering holes around that can satisfy that thirst.",

Since I didn't know the name of some of the items of I wanted, I ended up using my iphone to show the waiters a picture of the food.  A lot of the dim sum items were packed with meat, which ended up being too overwhelming for me.  The sticky rice seemed bland.  The daikon cubes were flavorless.  My favorite item would have to be the tripe.  I've had better luck at asian supermarkets that sold fast food dim sum.  Does AZ have anything like that?",

I would have grabbed several of the dessert rolls had I realized that this was going to be the only chance at getting something to eat.  My bad, we only snagged the Chinese broccoli thinking that one of the other 4 carts in the restaurant would eventually make it to us.  Another 15 minutes later, another one did, but the attendant proclaimed he was out of food and what was left was cold...never stopping.  When it was apparent that the reloaded cart was heading back to the other side of the restaurant despite our dialogue about feeling faint and promising him we'd be happy with cold dim sum at this point - we had to get up and leave.  Five stalks of broccoli.  Yum.  How is this possible when the place was packed at lunch time on a Sunday?!  To add insult to injury - there were 7 people in line in front of us - so we left a $10 bill with the check for 1 item on the counter....only to be chased after by the cashier who felt we needed to get back in line.  Just unbelievable. I won't be making the trek back there again.",

The weekdays are less busy, but they don't always have that large of a selection. A nice variety of dim sum and they also have good bbq meats. Having grown up in Vancouver and SF, it is tough to get 5 star dim sum in AZ, but this place is good and they have the authentic girls going around with the carts.  I would recommend it if you are a dim sum fan visiting the PHX area, or craving dim sum and do not want to drive far. The place could use a facelift as it seems a bit dirty inside and the bathrooms are not that clean. This place was the only place I knew in PHX when I moved here that had dim sum, but now there seems to be plenty of others to try.",

The worst thing about it was the wait staff wasn't very attentive and didn't do much except refill the cups when they noticed they were low (which wasn't very often).  The dim sum was plentiful and there was a lot of variety - however, unless you watch for the carts that just came out of the kitchen and only order off that one there's a good chance you'll get lukewarm or cold food.  I couldn't eat the ice cold duck and ended up taking it home and microwaving it later.  If they would just work on the heat issue and the wait staff, I think they have a shot with the city slickers.  ;)",

At one time it was Great Wall vs C-Fu in Chandler and now with the emergence of more Asian power centres, as well as an influx of Asians into the city, there are more dim sum places like Phoenix Palace by Lee Lee, Golden Buddha in the Cofco Center, China King in Chandler, and China Chan up north.   This place in my opinion is pretty good, and cheap. You just have to know when to go. The best time is at 11 on Sunday. Anytime after that expect a long wait, and before that (dim sum begins at 10a) it's ok but all the good stuff and most popular items and specials come out at around 11:30 in time for the rush. If you come in after 1. Expect alot of popular stuff gone =( . I'm partial to this place because my family has developed a good relationship with the servers at this place. We're not the typical dim sum diners since we also order certain items from the menu in addition to dim sum. I like their beef chow fun w/o gravy or the seafood chow fun with gravy but no fish. The salt and pepper squid is decent, and totally not a fan of the Chinese Brocolli with oyster sauce on the carts so we order the Chinese Brocolli with garlic sauce, much better and way yum! We also order a la carte so we can get rice with our meal because rice with your dim sum makes it better. Oh, and if you order roast pork, order it off the menu and not on the cart, it's a better cut and less fatty. And that calamari on the cart is not the same as the salt and pepper squid.   So when I'm craving some shu mai, char siu pao, bbq pork buns, steamed bean curd, and sugar cake, i head over to Great Wall for sunday brunch... and love the endless refills of jasmine tea! see ya at Great Wall!",

I would GREATLY advise you to avoid Sunday especially after 11 AM.  It is super packed, because everyone gets out of Church or just waking up.  You will be waiting for atleast 30-45 minutes for a table.  Food is served by waiters/waitresses pushing the cart of food around. It is a mad house when you get in, but the food is pretty good as far as Phoenix standards.  Can it compare to California, New York, or Toronto, Canada?  Hell no!

We, a party of about 12, were seated in the middle of the most crowded part of the restaurant, with 10 chairs. We had to get our own chairs.   I asked for water, which I'm still waiting for.  The food was pretty terrible. The only good thing was the Shu Mai. Everything was salty and dried out (probably from sitting on the cart). We also had to chase down servers to get food. I literally watched a a guy with a cart walk back in forth in the EMPTY section for 10 minutes so he wouldn't have to interact with anyone.   We saw a cart with several items we wanted on it, but instead of letting us pick from that cart, they were SAVING it for themselves to eat. With a restaurant pretty full, all of their employees sat and ate.   So, in conclusion, any one have a good recommendation for Dim Sum? Because this isn't the place.",

For dinner, I highly recommend the steamed chicken. It practically melts in your mouth. Order the soup of the day. It won't disappoint.  Dim sum had all the classics including roasted pork ready to be served as soon as we got there. Will definitely return.",

The last few times, were especially disappointing.  We had an event party, they dishes that we pre-order were pre-made!  That was bad!  Giving them ample time to prepare the food, we were served refried roast duck!  We order 6 ducks, everyone complained the ducks were soaking in grease with fried skin.  The chicken was just as bad if not worst, parts were still pink and parts were foul smelling.  We also had buddha's delight that was artificially redish pink color, strange looking and taste disgusting.  The rest of the dishes weren't much better, the only thing that was half decent was the walnut shrimps.  Don't recommend, don't come unless you are dying for dim sum, but don't order off the menu.  And check your bill, they have been adding on $4-6 by 'accident.'",

When you eat there for a large celebration it is generally between a 8 to 10 course meal. When eating this way you eat \"family\" style so you get to try multiple dishes and get a little of each dish and then spin the dishes around on a lazy Susan to share with the others at your table. The servers were okay but the restaurant itself is good when they have a banquet style.  Nothing to bring you back because of the decor or service, would probably only come here for the banquet.",

Chaos makes me anxious. The food was okay. Nothing was hot when it made it to my table. Also, plan on sharing a table unless you want to wait. This place is crazy busy - make some new friends - talk about the food. The chaos of the tables being close to each other, the carts trying to get through, and everyone trying to make sure that they get what they came for just makes for an anxiety driven situation for me.",

My family and I were the only non-Asian people there on a fairly busy night.  The portions are large enough to share and still have left overs. Comfortable seating as well. The only major issue that we encountered is that there is no handicap accessible ramp or space between the front parking spots to get a wheelchair through.",

The variety here is just awesome.   Golden Buddha, China King, Mekong Plaza, they were decent. Those places were good because you don't really want to travel that far for dim sum and those places were in their respective areas. Except Golden Buddha closed.   But for a complete experience, go to Great Wall. You should go on Sundays around 10:30am. That's when their menu is at it's fullest. Asian people go out Sunday mornings haha. There might be a wait but carts will come by more often, more items and you get to see a lot of Asian people. There are also items that are not on carts. Like giant noodle dishes.

The quality of food here and the service it pretty good, even when it's busy!  ****Environment: The place is pretty big with lots of round tables that can seat up to about a party of 8. The table wares are pretty clean and the bathroom so is the bathroom. Usually places like this doesn't have the nicest bathroom but here it was actually very decorative and modern.  *****Food: The food was great. It's really hard to find a good dim sum place with good quality dishes but I believe I found the place and this is it. I've had great BBQ baked buns, chicken feet, shu mai, rib tips and definitely my new favorite the duck tongue. The flavor and seasoning was all there not too bland or too much!  ****Service: The service was very prompt, and definitely made sure there wasn't an empty plate on your table. They would seriously take away any empty dishes within 1-2 minutes. They were friendly as well.  Overall if you are a dim sum fan, I would definitely recommend this place!

You have to take your cheque and queue at the register near the front door.  There were two parties in line in front of us and it took over 10 minutes to pay and get out the door.

First out of the kitchen and onto my dinner table was the hot & sour soup...a huge steaming bowl. Let me say, I have had hot & sour soup all over this world and while it varies in taste and consistency, this soup tonight was outstanding...absolutely outstanding. Next out of the kitchen was this salt & spice shrimp...wow, these were not shrimp at all...these were gulf prawns...huge...took two hands to pickup. The shrimp came with the heads and tails, and shells...not a problem for me, but perhaps a bit squeamish to others. No issues, I hoisted up one shrimp and gave the head a slight twist pinched the tail and dropped it into my mouth. Oh my goodness...these were awesome. Perhaps the serving was a dozen shrimp, I didn't count them, but there was quite a few. Remarkable...!!! Last out of the kitchen was the chicken chop suey...let me say that this was not the actual name on the menu, that escapes me, but it was a chop suet. It was also fantastic. But to be honest, with the soup and the shrimp, there wasn't much room left for the chicken chop suey. I needed a \"to go box\" to bring the left overs back to the hotel.",

Well, that's how I'm looking at things today because Great Wall not only made my tummy very happy, but I'm graciously looking forward to going back again soon to mack on their delish cuisine.  Robert M and I met some of his coworkers there this morning at 10:30 and were treated to some of the best and most affordable dim sum in Phx. Like, San Francisco good and affordable. I won't pretend to know the names of much that we ate but I can tell you everything was mighty fine. And the four of us were stuffed by the time we stopped eating and for $14.07 a person. Somebody hit me!",

    "text": "It's an entire day later, and I think I'm still digesting this meal. Man, I'm so full.  First off, huge props go to Sarah K, Pierre T, and Jeffrey O for meeting me out in nondescript west Phoenix for Chinese food. I've been trying for two whole years to get people to meet me here for dim sum and the thought of \"dining in west Phoenix\" turns off just about everyone (especially most native Phoenicians I know who are surprisingly \"west side\"-phobic.). So a big thank you to you guys for indulging me.  Next, the restaurant itself. Imagine a giant banquet-hall sized Chinese restaurant actually filled with mostly Chinese customers. Families seated around big round tables: grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, and the little kids. In Phoenix, this is a rare sight, and as opposite to seeing Grandma Ethel eating fried wontons with sweet & sour sauce at the Abacus Inn as it could be. So you know from the get go that Great Wall is doing something right with authenticity.   We sat down and were immediately brought tea, and if you've ever been to dim sum, you know that servers are constantly wandering around, pushing carts full of goodies. Steamed dumplings, fried dumplings, sweet dumplings, savory dumplings, buns, giant flaky egg rolls, stir fried kai-lan (Chinese broccoli), chicken feet, custard and other desserts, lo mai gai (sticky rice), noodles, the list goes on and on and on. We picked a variety of dishes as they went by (sans chicken feet), and went to town.   I'd say the dim sum we had was pretty decent. Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but obviously I liked it all enough because I was a nonstop eating machine until I was ready to burst (which was frustrating because there were so many more dishes being carted around that I wanted to try but I just. Couldn't. Do. It.) To be fair to Great Wall, probably next time I'd come earlier than 11 am and request a table closer to the kitchen in order to get the dim sum as warm and fresh as possible, instead of picking dishes that have been carted around the dining room for who knows how long.   The atmosphere was great - there's a certain cacophony in big dim sum halls that I really enjoy. Tables full of families and friends talking, laughing, and enjoying their food as more than a dozen servers are hovering around with their carts. And the best thing about us finishing our meal with us stuffed to the gills? Only $11 plus change per person. You really can't beat that.  All in all, a great change of pace from all my dismal Chinese restaurant experiences in Phoenix. And a restaurant like this will no doubt also have a full-on Chinese menu along with their standard Americanized menu for lunch and dinner, so I'll definitely have to swing by and try that as well.   So if you're ready to try Great Wall for some weekend dim sum, let me know and I'll be more than glad to join you.   Just not today.   Because I'm still full.  4 stars.",

We went on Sunday within the 10am hour and we were sat almost immediately and were rolling our chopsticks within 10 minutes. If you're one for new experiences and can tolerate a little disorganization then you will be just fine. Don't expect to be catered to because this place can be a free for all once the crowds kick in (11:30am) . You gotta be quick with what you want and don't stand around asking the cart staff in-depth questions like What's that?, What's in that?, and is that spicy? Be quick, look, and nod because you are holding up the line for the rest of us! Because Me soo hungry!  Don't be startled by the slowly moving cart with the 2 foot mound of noodles making its way through the eagerly awaiting crowd. Oh and yes, you will see Chicken Feet, lots of them. However, if you're not that adventurous then there are plenty of other treats to chose from. Just throw caution and pretense to the wind, dive in and enjoy!   Unfortunately I am not able to make any specific reccommendations because I don't know how to spell or pronounce most of the items on the carts... Sorry!",

Love that creamy shrimp,carrots and walnut appetizer. Duck is good. Mushroom dish is very tasty.

Great Wall serves many of the traditional items found in big cities that do it right.

Whatever you choose from the carts that are circulating around the dining room, the food is prepared properly every single time. Never have I had dry chicken or a shu mai that wasn't done up to par. It's all on point! Don't miss : BBQ pork buns (grab these as soon as you see them! They run out fast!) Roasted chicken Roast duck Shu Mai And for those who know these- the sesame balls with sweetened bean paste inside!! I know it sounds gross and it's really an acquired taste but man I love those!!!

They open at 10 but if you get there right when they open your selection for dim sums are not that good and you have to wait a long time between carts. We arrived around 1pm (they close at 3) and they stopped making food and there were only 3 carts going around. Pretty much trying to get rid of what they had made already.  When i asked the owner if they were making more food, she said no, they were not making any more because they were getting ready for a party that night. I guess we weren't that important.  The people who do the carts do not make eye contacts with you (Could be cultural) so you have to holler at them as if you are trying to catch a cab in NYC. They have a lot of people working (walking around to fill your water, pick up empty dishes and change tables) so you can always grab one of them and ask for what you want but I had a challenge with that too because I don't speak Chinese or Vietnamese but luckily they did  have staff that I can communicate with. Wait staff are very helpful and friendly. Probably why I return to this place.",

There wasn't any additional seats, they were booked to capacity. When we checked in with the hostess we were asked if we would be willing to be seated with other people. We said no problem but when our name was called we ended up with just the two of us at the table.  The dim sum experience is not for everyone.  Those not accustomed to the noise and crowds should stay away. The place was Jam packed with Chinese families which was a good indication of how the food would be.    All the carts came around frequently. Service was standard for a Dim Sum restaurant. Nothing much to complain about or compliment.  This place was really crowded. It was a bit uncomfortable because the tables are really close to each other, and the aisle aren't hat wide. With the carts going around the place it can get super cramped and uncomfortable. Oh, it was also super noisy, but that shouldn't be a surprise for such a crowded establishment. The servers pushing the carts around were hard to understand so I have no idea what we had or what was in the food but I can tell you we enjoyed all the dishes we picked.  None of the dishes really stand out. The food was good, not spectacular, but Just your standard dim sum fare. With the exception of drink refills because no one came around to refill our beverages.  FOOD: The menu is standard Dim Sum. PRICE: Expensive -This accounts for why I rated the place only a three. My wife and I spent $30.00 on lunch and didn't really have that much food. I can't imagine what families must spend here on a big meal.   ABIANCE: Nothing fancy but you don't come here for the ambiance you come here or the food. SERVICE: . CONCLUSION:  The food was decent and the price was high for what you get. The decor was non existent and all tables/chairs were all covered and not the most comfortable. However the Great Wall managed to satisfy that dim sum craving but was not even close to the best I've ever had. The search continues. RETURN  FACTOR: 90- 95%  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT",

Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good for dim sum in the Phoenix Area, considering there aren't that many.

    "text": "Why would you name a restaurant after a thing designed to keep people out? Just like china this place is huge inside, and even has tanks of live fish.  The menu is huge, and this is just the menu for the gringos. If you know Chinese there is a whole menu of family meals that you can order from.   There are many vegetarian dishes not just the usual tofu and veggies, they have a large selection of exotic mushroom and veggie dishes.  I had the golden mushrooms with tofu $7.99 a house specialty. Mitake mushrooms a light brown sauce and huge pillow of soft fried tofu. It was nice ans somewhat light  We also had the black mushrooms with Chinese greens. $9.99 This dish had a very earthy taste and the greens were very fresh but hard to eat with chopsticks.  Another great dish was the veggie hotpot that had some really interesting textures along with the noodles and veggies.   Service was a bit lack luster, but maybe that was due to the wedding in the other side.   The shopping center it is in is a bit run down too so you are assured you are paying for quality food and not the building.   Bottom line great selection good flavors good value mediocre service.",

I always recommend coming here if you are looking for dim sum in the Phoenix area!!!!",

We have been here a couple of times after my first review and I am not longer as excited about Dim Sum, lol. But the food is still good and it is fun to try so many different items. We have been there only during weekend, I think Sunday all the time, and there is always a wait in the morning (brunch/lunch time).  The mango desert with carnation like milk is also very good.

    "text": "I came here around 3pm on a Saturday and it was dead. I had heard great things about their dim sum and I was dying to try it! I grew up in San Francisco eating dim sum in some of the best hole in the wall shops so I wanted to absolutely love this place!  Well, I didn't realize that they only do dim sum BEFORE 2:30 (every day). That was a fail on my part. We decided to stay since we were already there and starving. We ordered the egg rolls, wonton soup, kung pao chicken and bbq pork chow mein (all pretty standard dishes). My two star rating is based on the fact that their dishes lacked flavor! The kung pao was so bland and didn't pack any heat at all! And I'm not one who enjoys eye watering, mouth burning heat but I at least expected there to be a bit of a kick. The chow mein was greasy and the bbq pork was dry. The only thing that I actually enjoyed was the wonton soup. I wish I had ordered more of that!  Most everyone mentioned the lack in customer service and honestly, that usually doesn't bother me. But when I have to get my own take out box or my own water because no one cares to check up on us, that's when it gets a bit annoying.  I may go back and check out their dim sum but I'll be sure to bring my own drinks and Tupperware with me next time.",

This is your typical Chinese restaurant that has dim sum on the weekends, closes for banquets/weddings, and serves really good Chinese and Vietnamese food. Everything is good here. I love the har gow and siu Mai, and I also really enjoy the jellyfish dim sum dish though I noticed it lacked the seaweed accompaniment that I'm used to. The bread and buns are tasty! I haven't found an Asian bakery around the area so eating dim sum desserts will have to do. Definitely a great spot for dim sum.  Be forewarned that it gets pretty busy on dim sum days. It seems like every Asian family in the area comes here so that speaks to how good the food is. Additionally, there are a lot of options for dim sum, way more than I'm used to do you may have to look through every cart until you find something you like, which shouldn't be very hard. I can't wait to revisit by go-to dim sum spot!  PS. Here's a tip for dim sum novices. If your teapot is empty, flip the lid upside down on the teapot. That's the unspoken way to get a refill on your tea.",

I felt bad for these 2 guys at a table in the corner who only got food if they frantically waved down someone. And it was not a racial issue because they even spoke Chinese. The cart with the shrimp in the crispy wonton skin never came by so we asked a man who was taking orders for another table. He brought theirs but never brought ours. As we were leaving, I saw the lady with the shrimp we wanted standing outside the kitchen and people were having to walk to her! I figured it was because it was Chinese New year and maybe they were tired from celebrating.  Just went back today. Usually there is a huge crowd out front of people waiting. It was empty. It was a sign. Again poor selection. And then we got the pineapple buns- 2 out of 4 were empty! Literally no filling! I wish I had snapped a pic but didn't want to make a big deal of it since it was a celebration meal with the family. But we brought home some coconut buns and my brother bit into one and it was empty too! I got a pic of it. I cut the second one and it too was empty!  So disappointed. No wonder all the customers have disappeared. I wonder if they got new owners or something.   Guess we are going to have to drive even farther to the east side for good dim sum.",

Since I was a young child my family has spent countless birthdays, holidays, and Yee banquets dining at The Great Wall. With that, perhaps I'm biased. But this restaurant is by far my favorite restaurant of all time. The food is good tasting, and I've made countless memories dining surrounded with my family.  Since moving 800 miles away to Pocatello, Idaho; a small town with no dim sum houses or chinese restaurants worth a visit, I have found myself having to make my own dim sum. Learning from the internet and frequent calls to my grandparents, and constantly tweaking the recipe with The Great Wall as my standard. If anything speaks to the quality of this restaurant, it is that since moving away, missing their food has motivated me to spend countless hours in the kitchen, making har gow, siu mai, hom sui gok, and many more of my favorite dishes. If I could give six stars I would.",

I really like the chili sauce they give you, the dim sum with just shrimp in it is my favorite just because its a simple dumpling and with chili sauce YUM. I tried the porridge which was okay and the chicken feet... not a fan although my bf says the sauce is very flavoring. they had these buttery looking bread things that i thought was dessert but inside of the bread had this red saucy chicken which didnt taste too great.. i just thought it was a simple bread.... ): disappointed.   its really hard to understand everyone because (idk if its because im asian) and they try to speak to me in chinese or vietnamese (im korean) or if they really strong accents.. i just dont know what theyre saying...   although one of the servers was asian-american and spoke chinese and english fluently which made things alot more comfortable for me and i appreciated it alot more than i should ^^   food-wise, it's an okay place for dim sum, id come back just because there arent many dim sum places in the valley but if i had another place to compare it to maybe theyd be better? not sure...",

The food tastes even better when you are hungry.   Sometimes people recommend me eat during dim sum time. I tried it, but I prefer the other thing. Since you have been here for many times, you know  your favorite order and don't need to pick randomly.   The price is little bit high, but it worths.

This place has many of the traditional dim sum dishes and sometimes they would bring out specialty dishes either on the carts or by server to the tables but that is few and far in between.  One of the specialty dishes I always look for when I come here is their calamari.  The past few times I visited, they have not made it and it always saddens me because it is one of my favorite things to order.  I've never had any issues with the food and service from the staff is usually fair.  This is a great dim sum place for not being in LA or SF.  Tip: get here as early as you can on weekends.  Like as soon as they open kind of early.  They do get very busy very quickly and is not uncommon to wait 30 minutes to an hour if you come during peak times.",

Waters are never refilled after the first time, the plates and dim sum holders are nasty. They need to wash their dishes better.   I am not Chinese, so it's hard to communicate with the ladies their who doesn't really speak English. (Not trying to be rude). But not everyone who comes here are Chinese so it is very hard to talk with the workers here sometimes.   The cashier lady is just a no no. She is always asking for tips.

    "text": "Recently went here during the weekday for lunch and was surprised how different the service was compared to the weekend. The options for dim sum are very limited during the week, the bao was quite different as the bun had a sweet taste to it rather than the plain white flour which is more salty. The weekends are quite busy and they open at 9am The staff was pleasant, the prices are reasonable. This restaurant is quite a distance from my house so I doubt we would go back especially during the week. May consider going back on the weekend as there are limited places for dim sum in the valley.",

A friend suggested we try the dim sum at Great Wall in Phoenix. I have to say it was pretty good! There were Asians eating there which is a good sign! There were wonderful dumplings, not a great variety but what was there was good! We had egg rolls with shrimp inside, shrimp dumplings, rice noodle with bbq pork, tofu skin stuffed with mushrooms and veggies, we had a lot! There were lots of desserts we had the oval bun with pineapple, that was really good!  I'm going to come back again to have lunch and try their noodles. The lunch specials I saw go by looked really good.",

I was lucky to have been meeting up peeps who already got a table, so I didn't have to deal with the wait. Phew! So I have no idea what the process is like for that, however it was jammed packed in there and full  blown busy. Plus there were a huge wait on a sat. afternoon around 1:30 pm.   Most authentic Asian restaurants arent known for the customer service, but they do a good job in acknowledging us there and having my water glass full, so I guess I can't complain too much haha.   I need to make another trip back and try more, but I highly recommend the noodles, fried jalapeno chicken wings, dumplings, BBQ pork, and the little buns with the sweet custard inside. LOVE!",

We arrived at around 11 am and sat at around 12:15 but this was on a Sunday. But once you are in, the fun begins. This isn't like your regular Chinese restaurant. The servers push a cart filled with food and if you pick something from their cart they will sign your ticket. Now, as for the food, you have got to try the shrimp dumplings and their chow mein. It's so delicious. You also have to try the pork barbecue buns, the sesame balls and the buns that has a red dot. It's filled with a custard like filling, it's so good. My husband and I ordered waaaay too much food. It cost us 40 dollars and we have so much leftovers to bring home. We'll be back soon!",

After a while the servers stopped checking on us we inquired about more food but went on deaf ears so we left but the bill came to $82 bucks.  Not too sure how it got to be that much not too sure if we will come back BTW only 3 of us eat.",

My first dim sum experience in PHX but also many other Chinese events are held here year in and year out.    Dim Sum is a staple here at Great Wall and is always jammed pack on a Saturday and Sunday morning.  I can say Great Wall has had it's up and down days, but since Dim Sum is rare in PHX; I always come back.  I shoot for the basics here Shu Mai, Sticky Rice & Chicken, BBQ Pork Buns, Pork Belly, Chinese Broccoli, Egg Custard, and Sesame Balls.  Overall, it's what you expect from any Dim Sum place.  I would say your best bet is to stay safe and know what you're getting.  At the price you're getting Dim Sum here it's totally worth your while for veteran Dim Sum connoisseurs.    The place itself is decorated like your basic Chinese restaurant as you can imagine in any American movie; yes the red signs and fish tanks.  Service has improved through the years and that's a relief! - Enjoy!",

Seattle and San Francisco are the best and occasionally cities like New York and Minneapolis surprise us. Phoenix has never recovered from the demise of C-Fu and China Doll. While C-Fu still exists, it hasn't served good dim sum in over ten years.   Great Wall. Hmmm. I want to love this place. I've eaten there every 2-3 years for twenty or so years. I've never found it to exceed average. The service is good. The vibe is cool. Some of the dishes are ok. The baked Barbeque pork buns are good. The pork shumai is pretty good. The shrimp dumplings are ok. But the rice noodles are flavorless and starchy. The deep fried shrimp balls were fine.   So Phoenix, with a healthy dim sum tradition, hasn't had memorable dim sum in 5+ years. Why?  Great Wall may be the best of a mediocre handful of dim sum joints but that just seems sad. I guess I'll try the food court in Mesa, Mekong Palace. I have heard good things, but only from Phoenicians, whose taste I'm starting to question.",

Mostly empty at dinner time.   Handed immense menus, with an intimidating list of items. Server was absolutely disinterested in talking to us, and seemed somewhat impatient when asked for recommendations, as if we were dullards totally unfamiliar with the process of ordering something. He pointed to a series of items that appeared arbitrary, but I just just kinda went along with it because I really wanted to see what they had to offer. I was unimpressed by absolutely everything that was brought out, with the most offensive being a plate of sweet ribs that managed to be tough, greasy, sticky, and oily at the same time. Not everything was terrible, but none of it left a positive impression.   Maybe there's something worth ordering here, but I didn't have it.",

Servers stroll the large dining room and some of the servers stop at your table and say, \"Want Something?\"   Some of the food we tried was DELICIOUS like the appetizer super crispy fried chicken and the tender crisp Chinese Broccoli possibly called Yu Choy.   Some of the food I found was for an acquired taste like the mushroom and bean stuffed tofu skins and the sticky rice.   Some food looks familiar but is different than expected like the sesame balls that I had at many places stuffed with sweet bean paste but here they were stuffed with fruit.  There is a slight language barrier with some of the help because for some English is a second language.  I asked the cashier when they serve the menu so I could order off a menu next next time and try the fresh fish. The cashier just recited the restaurant hours to me.  The very large dining room looks like a banquet hall and looks like it holds over 300 people. They sat us on what looks like a stage. I was able to leap up to the table but it would be too difficult for some people.  We shared 5 plates of food and it cost around $27.00",

If you can look past that though, you will find one of the best Chinese food spots in Phoenix. The food here is fantastic! We started with crab puffs, egg flower and wonton soup. The soup was served piping hot and was fresh and tasty. Crab puffs were also very good, but a touch greasy. After the appetizers we were excited to see what dinner would hold and we were not disappointed. We ordered Kung Pao chicken, walnut shrimp and Singapore street noodles. The Kung Pao was amazing. The sauce was fantastic and just the right amount of spicy. The walnut shrimp was perfectly plated and flavorful. The Singapore street noodles were delicious, but a bit hotter than the spicy Kung pao. It was a great first experience and we're so glad we tried it.",

    "text": "This is my favorite dim sum place in Arizona. I'm such a huge fan of Great Wall. They never fail to provide deliciously prepared fresh food. If you love shu mai, spareribs, roasted duck, congee (rice porridge), char siu bao and many more traditional dim sum dishes: THIS IS THE PLACE.  And please don't get me started about the baked goods. The custard buns are my favorite. Dinner is great here too for groups. You can order different dishes and share with your guests. There is plenty of dishes to choose from. If you are able to come during lunch, they do have lunch specials.    Some people are not huge fans of the service at Great Wall, but I think it might be more of a cultural aspect or language barrier. But between me and you, I consider it part of the experience. :) As silly as it sounds, there is no other place like Great Wall, and it well worth it for the food.",

The overall rudeness of the wait staff beyond belief.  I went back last week for Chinese New Year's and had a wonderful experience with the staff and great dim sum. They must have been having a real bad day earlier in the year. I'm very pleased because I did not want to lose this place as its the last dim sum place in Phoenix. All the others are in the east valley.",

Theses one of those places thats tucked away in a shopping plaza that looks slightly questionable, but you know the food will be good. Everything checked out good as I looked around and it seemed like I was one of the only non-Asian persons there, which is a very good sign that I am in the right place! When they have live fish tanks in the back where you can pick or buy your seafood you know its the real deal!  Service was a bit slow, but they were fairly busy when I was there for lunch, overall everything was good.  I would go back again next time I get the Dim Sum craving.",

My buddy happens to be a connoisseur of some weird dishes so I was apprehensive half the time he put something new down in front of my and told me to eat it. However only on one occasion was I disappointed (I am not a chicken feet fan). The food here was really tasty and flavorful.   I really liked the shark fin dumplings (named for the shape according to my buddy), the shrimp in noodles, and the sweet tofu at the end.  For a first experience at Dim Sum this was a good one and has me wanting to go back to try some more. The one thing I wished they had was something that made it a little easier for me to figure out what was in each dish, although this time it wouldn't have mattered much.",

Unfortunately, I can't recommend any of the names of the dishes because I don't know them! :( Well besides the general dumplings and steamed buns. There was this super delicious eggplant one though!   After eating for a little under an hour, our final damage ended up being about $10 per person. I was completely full and will definitely come back again!  Located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. Come with a big group and try all the dishes.",

It's hard to find a good Dim Sum place around the valley and I just went again today at 11am and it took 20 minutes to get a table.  The wait is because the food is good and mostly affordable as you order and they mark items on the little pink sheet that keeps track of the price of what you've ordered.  Since it's Dim Sum, and I don't have a lot of places to base it on, the place is busy and you need to let the people walking by know what you want which is unlike other places.  I don't know of a better dim sum place in the valley, I'd recommend coming here!",

    "text": "Great Wall Cuisine is an amazing restaurant that I've been to numerous times and was never disappointed. Despite the fact that the food is a little bit pricey (the seafood) but its varieties of Cantonese and exotic dishes makes it well worth it. Many of the dishes are traditionally Asian dishes but there are some dishes that can appeal to a more general customer. My personal favorite dish is the walnut shrimp because its taste is exquisite and is always well prepared.  There are many great dishes that Great Wall provides but their crown jewel is their dim sum. Their dim sum is arguably the best in Phoenix and its only downside is that it's only sold during the mornings until 3 PM. Even that fact can be made into a positive argument for the restaurant because  it creates a special feeling of excitement for the consumers to anticipate as they rush into the restaurant surrounding by people with the same intention of snagging a good table and order some of the fresh dim sum.  Great Wall is not a perfect restaurants and has some faulty areas and one of the negative area that Great Wall has is in their customer service. Most of their staff are usually casual and relaxed, that could be argued as a good thing, but in a busy restaurant environment it negatively affects them because it makes them look inefficient. However, something as minor as that can easily be improved on and make the restaurant as a whole. Overall, Great Wall Cuisine is a marvelous restaurant filled with amazing dishes and that I would definitely recommend.",

Now I know why people say that - because there is literally NO other place for dim sum within a 20 mile radius at least. Service was meh, and the food was very inconsistent. Some of it was warm while others (such as the turnip cake) were cold. Decor was lacking and it was very dark and dingy on the inside. It was the kind of venue where you would have a cheap Chinese or Vietnamese wedding and you can tell right away that it's cheap. I likely won't be coming back as I'd rather drive the extra 20 minutes to get better dim sum in Mesa or Chandler.",

    "text": "It's Saturday and we decided to go to Great Wall for dim sum. I had heard about this place from my cousin, but didn't have a chance to try it until today.  We got a late start and by the time we got to Great Wall it was close to 1 pm.    The place is fairly spacious and we were seated right away. We noticed that they had a live fish tank with lobster, dungeness crab, assorted fish and even shrimp.  The bustling dim sum carts came to us pretty quickly.   We tried the following items:  Steamed spareribs- small cubes of spareribs steamed in a black bean sauce. It was actually pretty tasty and not super fatty like some places. Would order this again.  Long noodle (churng fun) with shrimp-  the noodles were too thick for my liking even though the shrimp was nice and crunchy and it had a light soy sauce over it. Probably won't order this again unless the noodles are rolled out thinner.  Baked pork bun- these buns looked great, all nicely golden brown with a light layer of sticky syrup to give it a sheen. The bun itself is soft and tasty, but I had to take literally 4 bites of the bun to get any \"char siu\" or bbq pork filling. Slightly disappointing.  Cocktail bun- these buns seem to be quite popular, as the lady took one quick round trip around just half the room and they were gone. 3 buns come in one order. These are long shaped buns with some sesame on top. Inside are sweetened coconut filling and the bun is soft. A good combo and better than many other places I've tried.  Chinese tamale (jung) - A lotus leaf surrounds the savory goodness of rice, pork and green beans and chinese sausage (lap churng). They also have the option of peanuts instead of green beans if you want.  Fried taro puff-  Mashed up taro is stuffed with minced pork, green onions with 5 spice powder and fried up with this puffy coating. I thought the taro puff here was a bit harder or denser than some places I've tried.   Steamed shu mai- is perhaps one of the more famous Chinese dim sum items as it is steamed shrimp and pork dumpling. However, the shu mai at Great Wall is mediocre at best.  The shu mai is a bit denser than I am normally accustomed to and the skin falls off easily as you pick it out from the mini steamer.  Pan fried turnip cake- this was surprisingly better than expected. It was pan fried to a nice golden brown on both sides and you could taste the dried shrimp, lap churng and bits of turnip. Definitely recommend trying this.  Congee / Porrdige - we tried the 1000 year old egg with salted pork porridge and it was fine. Lots of chunks of egg and pork mixed in the porridge.  The bill came out to be a little over $27 for 3 people - not bad at all.  I haven't tried their dinner items so this review is just for their dim sum. Over all, one of the better places that I've encountered while visiting the Phoenix area. Would come back for dim sum again and will give this place a try for dinner sometime soon.",

I went to Great Wall around 1pm on Monday (a holiday, and they were pretty full) for dim sum,  I tried (using.the English/American terms): Rice cake Bbq pork bun Shrimp dumpling Pork dumpling  Coconut custard bun (the best item I ate)  Everything was decent.  Not amazing, not very warm and steamy, but just solid three star food.  The coconut custard bun/bread was actually much better than C-Fu's though, which was a delight!  They were out of many things or only had two of something so you had to choose a third item of another type (which may be one you didn't care for).  I was unable to try the sesame seed balls and custard tarts because of this.  They also did not have a lot of what was on their takeout menu, but to be fair C-Fu only has their full selection on weekends, so maybe Great Wall follows this same practice.  There was nonexistent wait staff (since we only had dim sum and didn't order from the normal menu?), and we had to ask one of the cashiers/hosts for water.  I was tempted to just grab a pitcher myself!  I actually did grab my own to go container (I do this all the time at C-Fu).  Some of the cart attendants/servers were very nice, but a little difficult to understand.  Decently priced, but very sketchy location (their shopping center is pretty empty and anchored by a thrift store).  Lots of people (almost all Asian) were around and the immediate parking area was quite full though.    At least it was almost right down the road from the business Costco, so I was finally able to go there (was tempted to check out Los Altos Ranch Market too, that's for next time though).",

A good portion of the servers are not fluent with english and they tend to focus on the tables that speak Cantonese/Chinese etc rather than dividing their time equally amongst all paying customers.  It took me 25 minutes just to flag down a server to order lunch, and I asked for more ice tea three times and was never served.  Ended up walking over to the server station and pouring my own.  The service alone warrants 1 star but the dimsum quality is so high that I cant help but offer a 3 star rating nonetheless.",

The place -  the restaurant had a strong smell that was not pleasing to say the least The service - Bad! they were running a vaccumm cleaner while we were having our meal!! Te food: horrible - it had no taste - we ordered a noodle soup and a veg main course... the noodle soup tasted like boiled water with noodles..  I've been to Shanghai and I know this was neither authentic nor good!!",

I always get their salt and pepper pork chop and green bean XO sauce, they are heavenly. Don't expect good service though, couple of the waiter are nice but most of them are kinda rude; but I came for the food not the service. Just wish they are a little closer to home, have to drive around 30 min to get here.",

Really great and authentic cuisine!~ I would have given 5 stars had the service been faster - we waited 20 minutes or so for the steamed pork rib.  Overall, this is a fantastic place for dim sum~",

I can't say it's the best I ever had but I'd say pretty decent for Phoenix standards.  The only place I have to compare this place to though is the Golden Buddah @ the Chinese Cultural Center and I'd say Great Wall is definitely better.    We got there at 10am and were seated immediately.  However, they didn't have all the selections out until close to when we left, around 10:45.  It was disappointing but the foods we did have were good.",

    "text": "Poor quality Dim Sum. You will get slightly better at C-Fu Gormet or Phoenix Palace in Chandler (both at Warner and Dobson). That said, none of these restaurants compares to the quality of many large city Dim Sum restaurants like Yang Sing in San Francisco.   The Great Wall clams would be much better without the horribly bitter sauce dripped over them. And someone needs to teach them how to make sesame balls which should have a sweet yellow bean puree without a bitter after taste. We had several other dishes -- none up to par.  This was our third and last visit.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that \"Oriental\" does not pertain to people so, unless you want to get punched in the face, I suggest you refrain from using that word. Secondly, if you plan on visiting an authentic Chinese restaurant, expect them to speak very little English. It's no different than if you were to visit a Mexican restaurant and most everyone can only speak Spanish; it's a given.  With that said, the food here is the best it can get in the Metro Phoenix area for the price. I've been to other dim sum places in Chandler and they never compare to Great Wall. We go here at least once a week to get our shu mai fix and we make sure to bring friends along. Today, there were eight of us and we spent $40 (that's $5 per person for the mathematically challenged).   Make sure to order a few shu mai (shrimp/pork dumpling), har gao (shrimp dumpling) and rice cake before they get snagged by other hungry patrons. They also have the best custard buns around.",

I wish I could say that the dim sum was spectacular but sadly, the baking soda used to revive the shrimp in the oversteamed ha gao still lingers on my palate. Great Wall is plagued by the same factory-made dim sum that everyone else in PHX serves. In its favor, everything was hot. Owners speak Cantonese, staff mostly Vietnamese and Cantonese. Strange bring your check to the counter system for total and payment.",

    "text": "Who knew in midst all of the Mexican restaurants, you'd find a diamond in the rough for Chinese food.  Arizona doesn't have many Chinese restaurants to begin with, however this place rivals the places in CA.  It's not the place for ambience or mood, but the food is the most important for the Chinese and this place is great for dinner or dim sum.     Notes for ordering dishes: I loved the garlic pea sprouts/shoots.  Not all Chinese restaurants this vegetable, but this place makes have it fresh and crunchy and just enough garlic flavor to give it that extra pizzazz.  What I noticed is that this place serves unique fried noodles.  Perfect for vegetarians, this place actually cooked crispy fried noodles unlike most other Chinese restaurant that just comes out with soggy noodles.  Another dish I recommend is their spiced salt tofu. (jiao yan tofu).  Well anything with the spiced salt (jiao yan).  They deep fry the small pieces of tofu or whatever other \"jiao yan\" producing a crunchy crust and mix it with a salty seasoning and jalapenos.  Great for an appetizer!  My family and I also had their steamed whole fish.  Light flavor and prepared beautifully with the entire moist fish out on the table.  Just the sauce and rice alone tastes just as good.  Be sure to try their walnut shrimp.  Be sure you have a big mouth to fit one of these jumbo shrimp in one bite.  The sauce covering the shrimp has just the right amount of tanginess and sweetness that I'm looking for without being too thick.  And the sweet crunchy walnut complements the dish as well. Ordering the right dishes can make or break your experiences.  For this restaurant, be sure to pick seafood, their specialty.  They have live fish, crabs, etc in clear tanks so you can pick out your dinner victim.  And of course pick fried anything, especially with their spiced salt (jiao yan).  Notes for dim sum: Great Wall actually has a unique set of dim sum choices that you can't find anywhere in the valley (at least the Chinese dim sum places I've been to).  Although it's a bit more expensive than the other places in the valley I've been to, but it does taste better overall.  Even the basic dim sum dishes like shrimp dumplings, shumai, and chicken feet simply taste better and I would even say taste better than some CA restaurant.  Who'd thought?  Because the dishes are small, you can try many of them and of course I would go for the fried stuff.  :-) However be careful.  Keep your eye out for the moving carts, if what you want has been sitting there for a while, wait for a new batch.  Cold Chinese food just doesn't taste as well.  Only the tin dishes that are covered are fine, because their still hot after the servers make their rounds.  Go on the weekend for a wider selection and be prepared to have a wait.  But the wait isn't that bad compared to some places I've been to in CA.  Great to go with a medium sized party so you can taste more variety, but not have to wait a long time for a table.  Overall, this is a great place to get great Chinese food if you live in the valley and don't want to make a 6hr journey to LA just for good Chinese food (which I have done before).",

Located in the corner of the a big strip mall, you can't believe how big the restaurant is from the outside, which has no windows, with a small glass door... There is always a line for dim sum during the peak hour, but definitely worth to wait, if you have an asian friend who knows what to order can tag along, that is even better!  Very good dim sum and cheap price, just don't expect a fancy place. Have fun~",
