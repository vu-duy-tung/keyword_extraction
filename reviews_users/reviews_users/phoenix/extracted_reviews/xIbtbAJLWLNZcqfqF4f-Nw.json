Both were great, mine has a block cube of ice in it with a couple herbs in the cube.  Loved it, it's the little touches.  I ordered the pork filet minion and my bestie had a burger and fries.  Mine was excellent and also had a squash compote which was yummy, but that was it. It's ala carte if you want a second side.  Both entrees were yummy.  We both got desserts and mine actually was the highlight, it was the salted caramel dessert.  It tasted just like Wurthers candies like at grandpas but even better.  My friend had the gluten free chocolate. Oh la la, yummo.  Service informative, attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "I went here on Tuesday night with my husband and a friend.   The happy hour was pretty good - 4 stars: $2 off draft beers and cocktails and a variety of food items in the $5-7 range. I wasn't a huge fan of the egg on top of the fries (it got cold pretty quickly), and I prefer ketchup on my fries, not mayo - duck fat or not. However, I really did like the truffled deviled eggs. The chicken ($7), which you can't get any other time BUT happy hour, was OK. Apparently they used to have a large biscuit, but it's now about the size of a quarter - a delicious quarter, but a quarter nonetheless. Biscuits are cheap, don't be cheap with your biscuit portion, Salty.   Entrees and service - 2 stars: It took a full hour (an HOUR) to get our dinner after we ordered - again, this was Tuesday night at 6:30. The waitress took our order by memory, but messed up my husband's selection. He asked her specifically whether she thought the pork or beef was better and she said, \"pork for sure!\" So he ordered the pork, and got the beef instead. The beef was also, basically, a child-sized portion for $20.  I ordered the ABLT salad and the bacon almost ruined it... too smoky and chewy - the salad has enough going on with the ranch, bleu cheese, avocado and tomatoes - just use regular bacon! Also, put it in a damn bowl! After waiting the hour for the salad, I had to wait another 5 minutes for something I could actually eat out of... the long, thin, rectangular plate with no lip was (huge surprise) wholly inadequate to eat what is basically a wedge salad off of.  Our friend got the cheeseburger and really liked it. We had to ask for our check after spending nearly two hours in the restaurant. The waitress never did apologize for the ridiculous wait for our food. Even at a busy time during a busy day, waiting more than 30 minutes after ordering for an entree is unreasonable.  I might come back for happy hour again, and maybe try the cheeseburger, but I won't be in a rush to get back here.",

From the nice beer selection to the solid happy hour specials to the delicious dinner entrees I never encountered anything I'd change (high praise from an egomanic).  The bacon (pork belly) and eggs was especially good as were the tacos.  If you're in the northern part of Phoenix/Scottsdale you should swing by here soon and give it a try...unless you don't eat pork.  If that's the case, why are you reading reviews of a place called the \"Salty Sow\"???",

The sandwich would have been much better with a more substantial bread to soak up the well done savory liquid.   The duck fat fried French fries were very good, reminded me of McDonald's fries in the days when they used animal fat for french fries.   It is a nice restaurant but just didn't meet our expectations.",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at the Salty Sow in North Phoenix. I arrived during Happy Hour, but I was immediately drawn to two items not on the HH menu. First was the Bacon & Gruyere Crusted Bone Marrow. This was fantastic. I could have just eaten that all night. Yet there was an item on the specials menu that I couldn't pass up: Porchetta Cuban Panini.  Now, I believe there is only one perfect sandwich on this planet: The Cubano Mixto. Salty Sow's Panini sandwich is a very tasty homage to this heavenly pressed sandwich of pork, ham, cheese, pickles, and mustard. They also added onions, but this can be forgiven. ;-) What made this sandwich amazing was their use of the porchetta and un-cured ham. As a special item, I didn't know how often they featured it, and I am very glad I tried it.  The sandwich also came with their famous Duck Fat Fries. On this, I have to admit I don't understand why everyone raves about them. Are they delicious? Oh most definitely. Best pommes frites I think I've had. But that's sort of my point. They are just fries. Duck fat seems to bring nothing but maybe some extra crispiness to them. If you didn't tell me they were fried in duck fat, I'd think they were just fries. So, while very tasty, and unique as a side dish, I think this is really a novelty that one could eat once and then move on. In contrast, others might think the bone marrow is a novelty, but I would disagree and insist that they are worth the trip to Salty Sow alone.  So, after two regular prices items, the bill was hefty. More than I'd usually pay, however both items were great and unusual so I can't fault them.  I really only have ONE complaint: their hours. I'm only half-joking. They don't open until 4:30 PM. I have lived in this area almost two years and I have only just been to the restaurant for the first time tonight, because every time I've driven by until now, they have been closed, or very busy. Please, consider opening for lunch. Serve your Happy Hour menu as Lunch specials and I think everyone would be ecstatic. I know I would be.",

This Sunday we tried their brunch, $18ish for a brunch buffet with tasty bacon, chicken and waffles, eggs and omelette by request. They also have out salads, pancakes, French toast with bananas and chocolate, pork green chili, pork belly hash, veggie and pastry options and so much more. 100% amazing, just wonder how long the buffet style will last- today was the second weekend and people slowly trickled in so the buffet was not over crowded and the chefs were able to keep everything hot and fresh, but once word gets out this place will be packed and I worry they will change the awesome setup.",

The restaurant puts a sign out on Cactus to let motorists know. It's worth a visit just for this dish if you're up for hearty fare. I left tthe pork to my husband and had grilled octopus. It was perfectly cooked and quite tender. It came served with fingerling potatoes, roasted red peppers, and endive. They have creative selections as starters on their happy hour menu, too. We shared roasted, shaved Brussels sprouts with Parmesan topping. We finished by sharing the flourless chocolate cake which was better tasting than most. Our server, Michael, was professional and very personable. The atmosphere is pleasant with a great soundtrack of rock, blues, and country mix. Prices are moderate.  This is an update from March 2016:  My husband and I like to come to this place at happy hour. They always have some great specials and drink prices are reduced. We do order off the regular menu, too. One of our favorite items is the shaved Brussels sprouts salad. I tried the catfish tacos off the happy hour appetizer list. They were as good as the catfish we've had in the South. It was very fresh with no earthy taste, and the breading crispy. Other small plate  items we tried were fried eggplant, pork belly tacos, and the fried chicken. All were delicious. Prices are reasonable. Service professional especially the bussers and kitchen runners. As previously mentioned, I love the soundtrack of blues, rock, and soul, too.",

The pork chile was amazing and super spicy. The duck fat fries are to die for, and pork tacos are delicious, too. But one of my favorites has been the fried green tomatoes with guacamole. Yum! Service is good as well. Super friendly and have never had to wait too long for a table, food or a refill.   The patio is really cozy and enjoyable. The landscaping is done so well that you'd never guess that the place is nestled in a Wal Mart parking lot next to the oh so classy Tilted Kilt.

Food is delicious and unique -- my kids, who are total foodies, also love their innovative menu! We went the first week this place opened and loved everything about it -- there is a sea salt caramel custard-type dessert that is to DIE for... And their deviled eggs are among our faves! This place does NOT disappoint. If you don't mind the Wal-Mart in the background (just turn a blind eye or sit inside if you do) -- then try Salty Sow for sure. If you are a hardcore vegan or vegetarian, this is probably not the place for you, however, their salads and cocktails are also scrumptious so pretty much everyone should give it a whirl! Enjoy!",

Everything was just 5 bucks (except the salad) and let me tell you everything was delicious!!! MUST TRY!   Also fantastic service, and really cool atmosphere!",

He was incredibly knowledgable and passionate about the menu. His recommendations were impeccable, could not have been happier.  The truffled deviled eggs and ahi carpaccio to start were divine. The scallop special with polenta was phenomenal!! The gin cocktail with lavender was superb as well, not to mention the dark chocolate truffle cake... In heaven. Drew made our experience so wonderful, will certainly be back again. First ever yelp and well deserved!!",

Last week i came back to salty Saw for my birthday dinner and they had the $25 Chef tasting menu - what a feast that was! We started with chilled cucumber soup, followed by tacos, then our party split and most people had pork shoulder with pork belly and grits, and my boyfrient ordered halibut. There was no wrong answer there - everything was delicios. Finished with super amazing brownies. And all of that was $25 per person. Unbelievable....My boyfriend\"s parents are well travelled and  accustomed to fine dining and they were saying that was one of the best meals they ever had. Oh, and we got there before Happy Hour ended - $5 wine is not too bed either.   It was so good we came back for dinner a few days later. This time I had pork belly with collard greens( cooked perfectly )which was very tasty, but my new obsession is the beer they have  - Full Moon ,a tastier version of Belgian white.  Will be back for that soon",

But deriously, the food is very well-made and we were in and out of there (fully satisfied) in less than 45 minutes, which was perfect because we went to the movies afterward. Definitely a good experience overall. And hey, maybe our waitress was just having an off day, you never know!",

The outdoor seating is very nice.....and the Indoor seating has great booths with high tables attached to them. I have been to a couple of restaurants like this in Illinois and I really like the setup. The mood lighting is also very good....and it provides a very nice romantic atmosphere. I will give this place a try for lunch and dinner and at that time I will update this review to talk about the food and service. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",

This is just my opinion but the Honey Rosemary Dipped Chicken I ordered last week was really sub-par. The chicken was overdone to the point of very dry and if there was a teaspoon of gravy in the bottom of the dish that might be being generous. This review pains me because I love the place. The loss of Mr Shaw doesn't help. Sorry, I might have to go less often.",

    "text": "I finally went here after hearing about it for some time and... was let down. We came on a Saturday night at 8. I ordered the green chili stew and it was gross; too much cheese made it oily, the tortillas were thin and poor quality when they split when I rolled them. There was nothing (think onions, tomatoes) that came with the dish like normal. Just meat and dry tortillas.  My daughter got the cheese burger and it was a bun and burger with NOTHING on it, they literally do not have fresh anything, tomatoes or lettuce to put on it. I had to request mayonnaise and ketchup. I also asked for tomatoes, onions and lettuce and said I'd pay extra but they just don't have them. Weird. They did have broccolini which was pretty good. We wanted chips and salsa as we ordered the guacamole/chips and they don't even have salsa! I recommend a restaurant of their size, charging as much as they do, focus on providing the basics. Think of doing more than bare minimum to make a dish passable as what diners expect to receive. Omitting expected things from a menu doesn't make a restaurant unique or quirky; it makes it seem low budget, low quality and cheap. Think about adding salsa, fresh fruits and vegetables. My friend ordered the tacos  and said they were really spicy. I rank the service as a little less than average as the wait for drinks and ordering took longer than expected.   The patio is fun with tall picnic benches and sparkly lights hanging above. The margarita was good. Very nice ambiance, I recommend going here for happy hour but don't expect a fine dining experience. Above average bar food.",

They were amazing.    - Rainbow Trout Almondine - We both had this and agreed it lacked flavor.   The crispy capers were a nice addition but it needed something more.

At the recommendation of my coworkers, we ordered the truffled deviled eggs and the crispy Brussels sprouts leaves. The Brussels sprouts were so crunchy and flavorful, we ate them up in no time. The deviled eggs, the yolk was so tasty, and the bacon was a nice compliment, too. For our entrees, we all ordered different forms of meat. Mine happened to be the spicy chicken sandwich. All of our mouths dropped when it came out. This sandwich was HUGE! Not only was it super large, it was extra flavorful. The spice had a nice kick to it that wasn't overpowering at all; the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the coleslaw provided a nice neutral creaminess to it, too. Overall, the food was quite impressive. I need to mark my calendar to go back before October is over!",

The atmosphere is trendy and fresh. The seats were a little uncomfortable and we felt like we were sinking way lower than is comfortable to be at a table. That would be a nice update.   We had deviled eggs, bacon caesar salad, pork belly, pork tacos, brussel sprouts, and more. Everything was done perfectly. Bon appetite!",

I liked the gravy and the biscuit was tasty. We also tried the truffle deviled eggs which were my favorite things we had all night. For our entrees I ordered the pork shoulder rack plate, the pork was very good but the rest of the sides were just okay. My fiance got a double cheeseburger with pork belly. It was sloppy but otherwise pretty good. The duck fat fries reminded me of in and out but crispier, no sense of duck fat though. Cocktails were pretty good and our server was fast and knowledgeable. Based on this experience alone I don't think that I would make the drive and spend the money to go back. Just nothing spectacular",

    "text": "After 4 years it's time for an updated review.  What started as one of our favorite spots has deteriorated over time.  At first I thought these were just one offs, but now I see trends.    My last experience I walked in in the middle of the week at 7:30 and the place was maybe 1/3 full.  They also no longer have a daily special board to choose from and the overall menu selection seems to have shrunk.  Our brussel sprout Caesar was fairly flavorless and average at best.  My prime rib was quite good but my partner's pork belly was inedible.  When the waitress came by at the end of the meal and saw he hadn't eaten it she did offer to get him something else but at that point he just wanted to go.   No service recovery effort other than that.  Other meals lately have also been a mixed experience.  Amazing hot chicken sandwich and grisly filets at the same meal.  And again, no service recovery effort.  Note to management, when a server sees someone hasn't eaten their meal, check to see if there was an issue with the food.  I'm not giving up but I won't be taking business guests or friends here for dinner anymore.",

Who knew there were so many types of mixings for Bloody Marys?  There are and I know about it now!  My favorite items on the all you can eat brunch buffet were the bacon and the chicken and waffles.  I adored the green chili stew and the smoked turkey, too!     The service was friendly and the restaurant was trendy, cool, and clean.  We sat outside on the DOG FRIENDLY patio, which we all just loved.    I would highly recommend and we will certainly go again soon.",

I ordered the pork belly. It was amazing and done right.  I hate going to restaurants and ordering pork belly and pulled pork comes out. The grits that came with it were also good.  My hubby ordered the prime rib and didn't leave a crumb on his plate. He said it was cooked so good he had to go compliment the chef.  Service was good also. A great place with delicious food.

There were so many chips it was hiding most of the gauc.  Server didn't know anything about the menu food or drinks. I order a drink and I asked if it would be to spicy, he had no clue, when the drink came, it was so spicy I had to swap drinks with my bf, oh and the pork chops were so dry could barely chew it.

I have called the main restaurant and been told Lynda will call me back, which she never does. My co-planner went through the same calls, to no reply. It was only when a white friend called inquiring about setting up a dinner that someone even returned their call from Salty Sow. Is it racism? Probably not.

The taste was wonderful,  lightly breaded (cheat day) eggplant dipping it with marinara sauce and a mox with cholula hot sauce.. two thumbs up.  My entree was the vegetable board minus the beets, and he substituted it with fried tomatoes.  I didn't like that so much. The kale salad was on par and I asked for an extras.

One person got the burger and liked it ...And the cheddar grits were good. I had fish and chips, fish was greasy and over breaded.  Won't go back.",

    "text": "7/9/14  Came here to celebrate my birthday, albeit a day later.  Mom and aunt had never visited SS before, but cousin joined me for happy hour a few months ago.  While all enjoyed the atmosphere, we found the alcoholic beverages and food, for the most part, underwhelming.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=JH4WTi8bA2kMyK7rj5Fw_Q#JH4WTi8bA2kMyK7rj5Fw_Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/salt...</a>   Cousin talked up the Banana beignets and ice cream, as we shared one during hh months ago, and all but aunt, who didn't sample, liked it. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=AoUOns5QomxCLGgHKjNqDg#AoUOns5QomxCLGgHKjNqDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/salt...</a>  The ONE thing I COMPLETELY enjoyed was the (complimentary) birthday dessert, the dessert special of the day of Lemon Bar, tart, rich cream, and not very sweet lemon cheesecake on a crust that I didn't sample, adorned with homemade whip cream, fresh blueberries, and two mint leaves.  The homemade vanilla bean ice cream, though not needed as the cheesecake was sumptuous by itself, was a nice touch.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=rqWfmUCntSw0rLrWMY6Gxw#rqWfmUCntSw0rLrWMY6Gxw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/salt...</a>    Mom, who didn't find the beignets and ice cream dish anything to write home about, found the lemon bar quite tasty.  :)    Crispy Brussels sprouts- I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did in the past.  Bland, not crispy, and the pecorino didn't add the punch I remembered.  Beef shoulder and Spit-roasted pork tacos- cousin ate these and enjoyed them, but wouldn't order them again. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=9jh3odIqg17KC5SAEbd5sQ#9jh3odIqg17KC5SAEbd5sQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/salt...</a>  Fried chicken and sweet potato biscuit- The chicken was only partially-cooked-- dark pink center, and I couldn't chew through the meat completely.  My cousin agreed, and the server took it away and had another one fired up.  However, the second piece was also undercooked!  The manager came out and spoke to us, assuring me that the kitchen uses a thermometer to discern when the food is ready to be served, so the chicken should be perfectly-done.  The sweet potato biscuit was fine.  I was still disappointed in the quality of the chicken, and the item was removed from the bill.  Thank you, Salty Sow!  :)  Duck-fat fries- We didn't find it anything special, and I did not like the egg on top. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=0IZ2t2ayK9VRa1RhIwh__w#0IZ2t2ayK9VRa1RhIwh__w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/salt...</a>  I've had poutine fries at Nook and loved those, so it must be the duck fat used to cook the fries in that we all were not impressed with.    As far as the happy hour beverages we ordered ($2 off specialty cocktails)... My aunt enjoyed her Rosemary's Piglet, a pretty concoction of pomegranate juice, bubbly, and rosemary syrup; the ice cube had a rosemary sprig trapped inside it (this reminded me of the Rosemary margarita I had at the now-closed Renegade by MOD- check out the photos I included in that review*- very pretty!).  Cousin had the Salty Sow Sparkling Sangria (elderflower liqueur, bubbly, orange and lemon juices, one grape, opal basil), which she's ordered before and liked, and I tried the Miss Piggy (X-rated Fusion, bubbly, grapefruit sugar rim; I don't recommend it).    *Link to Renegade by MOD review <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale-2\">yelp.com/biz/renegade-by...</a>",

Our server was friendly but acted like she was in a frazzled rush from start to finish.  I ordered the halibut which tasted good, but gave me a horrible stomach ache soon after finishing dinner. My mother and I split a salad. I am a vegetarian and she is not, so I asked for meat on the side. My second bite had bacon in it. So because of the kitchen/waitress's mistake, I just unintentionally ate meat. When I told the waitress this, she immediately removed my plate but didn't seem overly apologetic.   Overall, the meal was expensive, the service disappointing, and I will never return to a restaurant that cannot accommodate a vegetarian.",

We sampled the Fried Green Tomatoes & Guacamole (super spicy); the Duck-fat Fries (amazingly crispy and flavorful); the crispy Brussels Sprouts (OMG yum!); the Green Chile Pork Stew (super flavorful and not too spicy); the roasted organic beets (tender and fresh); the white corn cheese grits (with a 110 minute egg on top... just do it!); and the fresh fish (to die for.) Are you hungry yet?? You should be and don't dilly dally about getting over there for a wonderful evening. Their cocktails are refreshing too - loved the sweet maple bourbon and the blood orange margarita. No room for dessert, but next time I'll try harder - loved it.",

I call Salty Sow and the manager kept going on how it was only 15.00 sandwich but he would put it back on my card. Well...this NEVER happined. I went back and was told that that manager was no longer employed with Salty Sow. And the manager I spoke to that day assured me she would put it back on my card. Not seeing it on the 3rd day and wanting to give them yet another opportunity to make it up to us we stopped by for a late dinner. Well the same manager was there. She assured us she put it through for 20.00$$!! It was a 100.00 check and that hardly covered the tax. She never sent a drink over a dessert. Nothing. And I'm sitting in her booth with a picture on my phone with RAW Chicken!! I have never negativly reviewed anyone but raw chicken people deserve to know about!!",

It's a cute, farmhouse feel with a cool bar and open kitchen and I'm not gonna lie, we chose this because I love the name : Salty Sow. It's different and almost comfort food amped up. As in, the pig has style, so make her fancy for the night. That's what I love. The chef twists a simple pork shoulder and makes it a little more fancied and decks it out in a little cast iron pot. We had sangria, margaritas,  a old fashioned and wine with dinner. Our apps were the deviled eggs and fritters. We know how to represent the piggy kingdom! My mom had the halibut and it was divine. We ordered the biscuits, as well. No one left hungry or dissatisfied; in fact we all loved it. Our waiter was sweet, attentive and knew his drinks and menu very well. I have some food allergies and he made sure to explain how it could be, well, fixed to this swines seemingly picky ways. We shared the bananas foster beignets.. A must but a 'must share' because they are sweet and rich. Oink. Oink.",

We ordered the Chorizo stuffed mushrooms which was delicious and had a kick to it. But, the mushrooms were teeny tiny with a thumbs full of chorizo. It was happy hour so it was $7. For that, I would try something different. The prime rib was cooked to perfection. Still juicy and flavorful. It came with mashed potatoes which was maybe serveral spoonfuls and horseradish.

Everyone there was exceedingly kind, from the hostess, to the waitress, even the sweet lady who was pressure washing the dumpster area as we were waiting in the parking lot. I lived in the area for a long time, never been here, until I unfortunately was involved in a car accident in the street right in front of the place. They gave us all water while we waited in the heat, asked if we were okay, and after everything was sorted out - I had lunch. The food is amazing, the service is stellar and personable. Just thinking of it makes me want to go again today. I work at a restaurant as a cook, a good one, and I care about what I do. But everyone here raised the bar of what I expect from myself and everyone in the industry. This place... These people... I can't compliment them enough. Thank you.",

    "text": "New favorite spot! Can't wait to bring my husband here because he's going to love it!!   Came here with my mom and we both fell in love with this place. Our entire dining experience was fabulous from start to finish.  Let's begin with dessert - - because who doesn't love dessert?!? We split the beignets and they were to die for! We were literally \"oohing\" and \"ahhing\" as we devoured them. When you take a bite, lo and behold you encounter perfectly caramelized bananas foster. Paired with the crispy dough of the beignet it's spectacular. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. As if that isn't enough, they serve them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. AND the portion is huge -- they tempt you with not one, not two, not three, but FOUR large beignets! This is a dish that four people could split. Well, the two of us tore them up and ate all four. (They wouldn't be good as leftovers...or at least that's what we told ourselves.)  We must've been hungry or tempted by their menu because we still made it to dessert despite splitting several appetizers and sharing an entree.   Let's talk appetizers. Stuffed mushrooms -- so good I was dipping the bread they served them with in the butter, garlic sauce. Fried green tomatoes with guacamole - win; plus, who can pass on that amazing combo. Duck fries - super yummy and the sauce they came with was awesome.   After all that, we split the beef shoulder entree. It was so soft, tender and the mashed potatoes and roasted root vegetables were perfect.   Food and service alone were five stars. I also love the decor because everything is tastefully themed with pigs (\"sow\"). Even the restrooms have cute decals, one with a pig in red heels and one with a boar.   I had such a great dining experience here! Next time, I can't wait to try their award winning deviled eggs. I'll be sure to leave room for dessert again!",

Picked the Salty Cow based and the menu and reviews. I'm here to tell you that this place is great. The service is top notch and the food is 5 stars also. The brussel sprout leaves are to die for. The Duck Fat fries are awesome. Me and the wife shared chicken and it was the bomb. Daughter ordered the pork belly....oh my...oh my... . My mom got the fish and loved it also. My son ordered the steak tacos, he liked them a lot.  I'm pretty sure whatever you order you will love it.   The Salty Cow was so good that we went back for our Christmas Prime Rib Dinner tradition. Once again we all looked at each other and shook our heads saying the same thing... It was probably the best price rib we have ever had. Mine is pretty good but man this was mouth watering.   We were stuffed after eating our dinners and was asked about dessert. Butterscotch Budino.... GET IT . We were so impressed with the food we ordered 3 desserts . Needless to say we waddled out of there with smiles on our faces. Gosh it's good.",

I was with two friends and everyone really enjoyed their meals. Beef shoulder, burger, nachos.. all were great. Server was nice, a little absent towards the end of the meal but she did a fine job.   Happy hour menu looked good and extensive beverage list. I will definitely be returning as I saw several items on the menu I wanted to try!  On a weeknight the place was full.

Some was cold & not rotating out for fresh fast enough.   I would give a much higher rating but the service ranged from bad to nonexistent. Our server blamed being over-sat at once. Maybe it was True but there was no manager roaming or assisting. The server didn't ask for help. He forgot our egg order and drinks took forever. Then he asked if we got the eggs yet and tried to blame the kitchen. We watched him walk over to place the forgotten order. He came out with them and made up some crap about the egg yolk being broken. It took almost until the end of brunch to get them.   Then in the miserable and annoying style of all incompetent servers he kissed butt and made excuses as well as apologizing for his poor service when he bought the check PRIOR to us finishing.   The food was good, but good enough to bring us back and to fight for dishes cleared, drinks we ordered, and food we ordered to arrive way to late? Nah. The management seems to have forgotten that there are dozens of other places to spend the same money and have it actually be FUN NOT A HASSLE",

Salty Sow has nothing but local beer on tap, great cocktails with some local spirits as well. The happy hour has a lot to offer with duck fat fries, tacos with a nice sunny side up egg, a salami-salmon dish. The entrees are great too with responsibly sourced product that favors an American-contemporary style. Everything is tasty, whether you're in the mood for a 3 course dinner or just an after work cocktail.",

    "text": "Salty Sow is a tough one to review, I'm afraid. While I was underwhelmed by the food, especially considering the prices, I was very pleased by the interior decor and by the service.  Being a budget-minded guest (whether I like it or not), I visited Salty Sow on a Monday night with a friend. Salty Sow had an all-night Happy Hour that night, which is what drew us.  Unfortunately, the HH list was pretty unimpressive, featuring options \"for sharing\" like the $5 tacos where you only get one small taco for the price. How does one share a single taco...?  After deciding that we weren't interested in spending $5 for a single small taco, we placed an order for the Duck Fat Fries to start with ($5). They were tasty, and well presented.  My friend ordered the Honey Rosemary Chicken off the HH list ($7) and was very impressed with it, as was I. The chicken was perfectly cooked (so moist!), the breading for the chicken was really well done (crunchy!), the sauce was delicious, and the biscuit was outstanding.  I ordered the double cheeseburger ($15) and was (unfortunately) far less impressed. Took about three bites and left the rest behind. Nice big patties, nice presentation, \"just eh\" flavor.  Based on the food, coupled with the high prices and small portion sizes, I'd give Salty Sow a pretty low rating. However, based on the exceptional level of service we received from our server, Shelby, and the beautiful interior, I have decided to raise my rating to a 3-star review.  Would I come back? Likely not for food. I think I would visit again, though, if I wanted to grab a drink somewhere upscale and comfortable with beautiful interior.  Between the real wood features and decor, creative lighting, appropriately subdued background music, and high-end service, I could see visiting Salty Sow again for a lighthearted first date (drinks only) or to catch up with an old friend.  Thank you, Shelby, for treating my friend and I so well. You were great. And thank you, Salty Sow, for creating such a beautiful ambiance and mindful decor.",

I had to ask the hostess to call out waitress. We ordered drinks and the deviled eggs, duckfat fries and the guacamole. The drinks were very good and the appetizers were wonderful. My party ordered the roast pork shoulder, halibut, double cheeseburgers and I ordered the pork belly.  They loved their food and wanted to come back to the restaurant. The only disappointment was the Pork belly. The pork belly I've had at other restaurants is juicy, charred and delicious. The pork belly at the Sow, was very dry. The flavor was ok, but the meat itself was dry and no fat at all. I will definately go back here whenever I come back to try the other dishes. The menu is very enticing...",

He read an item off the menu to ask a question about it, and she somehow took it as his order and walked away. She came back to our table a good few times to ask if everything was okay, so I'm sure she was trying her best, she was just too busy to handle everything. It seemed very understaffed that night. Eventually, though, our waitress stopped coming to check on us altogether and my father had to find her across the restaurant to get our check. We were all very anxious to leave at the end of the meal. We're definitely not returning, I'm sad to say.",

My friends ordered the lamb burger and the French dip and the French dip was better than the lamb burger. Also for sides just get smashed fried potatoes which is like a bastard child of mashed potatoes and French fries... A delicious bastard child.

We received a incentive from Marketing I think it was $20 off of 50 so we thought well maybe....So disappointed. The Menu is for foodies with No Limit to there budget. I spent 15 years in hospitality business including fine dining, M of Chicago D Frisco's Prime steak.  I know food, I know good service.  The waitress got into a snit when I asked her a question, maybe because it was is there any normal dishes on the menu ?  Kidding- I simply asked what was the most popular dish....Well we couldn't feel comfortable ordering the weird pork dishes, so we ordered steak, and it was okay but not fab Decor is extra nice...would love it if there HH had decent REAL food on it... but my dining $$ are dear too me, and this place is less than wonderful, too limited, too expensive. I would rather go to a dive with Great Normal Food than a nice Restaurant with Weird food.  I have dining at many 4 and 5 star places, like seafood, good beef, and great ventures in dining.....this was NOT one of those experiences. The steak as Pat B said looked smaller than advertised and while the fries were good- they weren't that Flipping good. Very surprised if this concept makes it.  When I want PORK do you mean there isn't even a Pork Chop on the Menu? They didn't even have pulled pork on the Menu when we went.. I think Chefs Really go off the deep end with a Menu like this were EVERYTHING is for Only Culinary Snobs.  Call me crazy but I want food I recognize and for Value a HH like Flo's Where Everything is HALF OFF  including Yummy food.............   So disappointed in this Concept.  Even if i was Offered a FREE Meal here I would just skip it.  Meh- I have experienced better    Way better.",

While the restaurant is practically in the Walmart parking lot you quickly forget that once you are inside.  A nice patio and live music on Th, Fri, and Sat also are a huge plus.  The majority of my meals have been solid but I can still remember having cold Berkshire pork which didn't kill the meal but did leave me a little disappointed.  That was probably 6 months ago and as I mentioned, we keep going back so take it for what it's worth.  On a side note who I presume is the restaurant manager normally makes a table appearance to check on your satisfaction.  Probably time we introduce ourselves which in past experiences usually ups the level of experience another notch.",

While the apps (we tried the duck fat fries, pork taco, truffled deviled eggs, and rosemary honey fried chicken) were just a hair off in the WOW factor--just felt they needed one more step of flavor to get that oomph--the lemon bar dessert was worth it. It left my sister and I intrigued enough to come back for dinner, and leave feeling like one of the sow paintings on the wall--bellies to the floor.",

    "text": "Not impressed. Decor: good. Service: great. Food: this is really the best you can do?  I went to Salty Sow during restaurant week. I was honestly pretty excited about my meal. I got a Copper State Mule to start (good, but not anything special - vodka, ginger beer, lime on ice). My first course was an endive salad. Pretty flavorless, except for the bleu cheese which overpowered everything. My second course was suckling pig topped with a fried egg. It was easily the most disappointing part of my meal. I don't know what part of the pig I was eating, but it was not appetizing. Some of it was chewy, some was tender (good), some of unrecognizable (not good at all). The fried egg added absolutely nothing to the dish. The steamed cabbage at the bottom of my plate lacked basic salt and pepper. For desert, I had homemade ricotta cheese that was topped with honey, dates, golden raisins, and cranberries with a side of toasted baguette. I'm all about simple deserts, but this, although good, did not wow me. Portion sizes were small and I felt like I was paying a lot for what I got (even at restaurant week prices).   It may be a good place to grab a drink with friends, but as far as food goes, I think you'd have a much better meal elsewhere.",

    "text": "I got to check this cool restaurant a few weeks ago.  The staff could not have been nicer or more professional.  The sustainable menu is very nicely done and is geared towards comfort foods with varying combinations of textures and flavors not usually found around here.  To be honest I do not usually go for this type of menu and can be pretty picky.  That being said, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed everything I tasted.  I did not try the Roasted Bone Marrow dish that someone ordered.  I could not help thinking that my dogs would have loved the Bone Marrow.  I also bypassed the \"Things in a Jar\" section.  I'm just not \"there\" yet and will refrain from further comments. We sampled many of the popular items that other Yelpers had mentioned, i.e. the Duck Fat Fries, the Muscles, the roasted beets and of course, the lamb burger. They were all deliscious.  The star of the show was the crispy brussel sprout leaves. Savory charred edges with a light delicate crunch.  YUMMY! I had one of the special entrees which may have been created for the Restaurant week.  It was an amzing halibut topped with asiago.  There would be no left overs this night.  We finished up with the Bananas Foster Beignets which were light and toasty with decadently tasting vanilla ice cream and honey.   I would highly recommend this unique and comfortable experience for anyone looking for something a little different and definitely rewarding!",

We asked for a table and they said 15 minutes so we grabbed a drink at the bar. It was crazy busy and we ordered a mule and a miss piggy to drink. Both good but I have had them before here and they didnt garnish them like they did before, probably because they were so busy. We had to go ask for our table 30 minutes later and got sat right away but it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to come, she was very busy but friendly and efficient. We grabbed another round and some appetizers which were delicious on happy hour the deviled eggs and the pate both were really good. For main we ordered the french dip and bacon and eggs. Both were delicious but very filling. We had the lemon bar for dessert and shared which was just right for two people. Also on Fridays they have live music which was really cool too. Definitely would go back just make sure you get there early!",

    "text": "From the Salty Sow Restaurant in Phoenix... Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries with 110 minute egg and cold bearnaise...one of the most delicious guilty pleasures ever...I was so intrigued by the 110 minute egg I had to dig deeper and discovered an entire science behind the time and temperature of cooking eggs. Of course it all has to do with texture and what has been determined is that longer slow cooking in non-boiling water allows the egg yolk to take on the guise of other foods such as sweetened condensed milk, mayonnaise, honey, cookie icing and Marmite respectively.  The viscosity of the yolk is determined by the final cooking time...at 110 minutes the yolk resembles cookie icing.  The fries alone were golden, crisp and had absorbed the flavor of the duck fat in a way that brings to mind and mouth the taste of that first bite of crispy duck skin at your favorite Chinese restaurant and pairing them with a chilled Bearnaise sauce that had just a touch of acid from the white wine vinegar was a great culinary choice. Add to this already decadent once-a-year treat the 110 minute egg and you have yourself an appetizer lifted from the ordinary to the spectacular. You hold your breath, break the quivering, golden yolk with your fork and then, letting your senses take over, double dip that fry into the Bearnaise and the Yolk...the mouth feel is one of cream, crisp and a touch acidic...you want to stop after a few because your inner voice is telling you this much goodness can't be good for you but you push on and make a deal with yourself to skip dessert...for the next year...just to have one more bite.  In honor of the Salty Sow I'm giving this dish 5 little piggy's...",

    "text": "I really want to give this place 3.5 stars because that's what it deserves, but I'll bump it up to 4 stars.  I have been here many, many times over the last 6 weeks and I think I have a good sense of this place.  First all, I have never had a bad server here.  Not once.  I don't know how that's possible, but it's True.  They are always very warm and attentive.  They are around when you need them and leave you alone when you need to carry on a conversation.  A few of them have made some poor menu suggestions, but taste in food is sometimes subjective, so you can't hold that against them.  The decor is really fun!  Modern, but comfortable and definitely not Scottsdale.  The music selection drives me crazy though.  There is never any theme.  One night I'm listening to great oldies and then I'm listening to hair bands from the 80s, and yet another night I'm listening to grunge from the 90s. Pick a theme, or genre, and stick with it.  The food is either very good or very bad (kind of like that old nursery rhyme: \"When she was good, She was very very good, But when she was bad she was horrid!\") Every single taco I have ever had here has been completely inedible, if only because the meat is completely dried out.  I was really bummed too, because they put a yummy fried egg on top, which adds a twist to it.  So, avoid the happy hour tacos.  The crispy brussel sprouts dish should be removed from the menu.  They finely chop the brussel sprouts into confetti and fry them.  The fried bits dissolve in your mouth in a weird way and all you can taste is the oil.  Every once in awhile, you get a big chunk of brussel sprout that wasn't cut into a small bit and ends up frying for a very short period of time (making it raw, hard, and taste like brussel sprouts, which is not a good thing).  All I can say is avoid it; no modification can fix what's wrong with that dish. The deviled eggs are done completely wrong, in my opinion.  Some people love to have tons of yellow egg filling for their deviled eggs.  Others are minimalists.  I'm a proportionalist.  I don't want there to be so much filling that the damn egg tips over (and they do).  I took half the egg off of each and spread it on toast, which was actually pretty good.  Do not get the tasting menu!  At $25, you would think it would be a great deal, but it's only worth $15.  Each \"course\" (that's being generous) is literally only two bites (delicious bites).  I still had to order a meal after I paid all that money for Costco size samples.  I absolutely love the Rosemary's Piglet.  It's a cocktail with pomegranate juice, rosemary syrup, and champagne.  it's heaven!  HOWEVER, they put a HUGE (size of your fist) ice cube with rosemary leaves in the drink, which only allows for a tiny bit of alcohol.  If you order any drink here, make sure you ask for no ice cubes.  The ice cube wastes precious space and is actually big enough to assault your nose or eye.  Moving on, the food that is good is a long list!  The fried chicken is out of this world (the sweet potato biscuit that comes with the fried chicken has been mostly good, but there have been times when it came out hard as a rock--if they made it smaller, this probably wouldn't happen)!  The lamb burger is orgasmic, and even though they gave me a really bad stomach ache from being so rich, the fries are heaven as well.  They have really good happy hour prices for specific drinks and dishes.  I've also never had a bad cocktail here.  I can honestly say my only bad experience was during restaurant week.  Each course took 30 minutes to get.  The manager paid for one of my cocktails, but being there for 2 hours to get an appetizer, salad, dinner, and dessert was a bit painful.  I haven't had that problem since.  So, after a very long review, I would definitely say go and enjoy the place.  The food is unique; there's a neighborhood feel to the crowd and the servers, and minus a few bad eggs on the menu, the food and cocktails are delicious.",

    "text": "The first time I went here, the experience was a five star rating. The last two times that I visited, I was disappointed with some of the changes to their dishes. The food is by no means terrible, The service is very good. I really liked some of their craft cocktails. The problem for us is they took some of our favorite dishes off the menu, so now we don't have much of a reason to come back. The Candide pork belly was one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had, it was sweet crispy on the outside, juicy tender and flavorful on the inside, but now it's just like slow simmered pork stew. The food is presented nicely, I really like the atmosphere, but for the price which is not cheap, I feel like I'd rather save money and make similar dishes at home. I'd say give it a try because it might just be that we were used to one thing and now we don't like the new version but if you've never been there before you wouldn't have anything to compare it to and might like it just fine.",

I ordered the prime rib sandwich and it was amazing, along with the avacado and fried green peppers.  Service was great, extremely prompt! They have an eclectic drink list and good wine to choose from, a tad high on the wine but not too crazy.  I'm looking forward to coming back when it cools down as they have a great patio area with misters that looks just perfect for happy hour.",

For under $20/person you'll find an array of savory items like cauliflower wild rice, brussel sprout salad, ham, porchetta, fried chicken and waffles, fried green tomatoes, green chile stew... PLUS eggs/omelets cooked to order.   The dessert options/breakfast sweets are a bit of a disappointment but there are $5 mimosas and bloody mary bar, so who needs dessert! ;)  I would still rate this the best buffet brunch in the Valley!",

    "text": "Walking up to the cute lit up signs out front, hearing live music coming from the speakers, and into this beautiful open layout of a restaurant; I could tell that this was going to be a good date night. My husband and I sat at a cozy high-top booth in the bar area. We were greeted by our lovely waitress who walked us through a few of their fancy drinks and their specials for the night. We decided on the Smokey Sow Martini (Titos vodka, with bacon and cream cheese olives.) and The Petey (Eddy's Grapefruit Vodka , Mint, Orang, Agave, and Soda water.) Both were nice and strong. I would say the Smokey Sow was mostly a regular Dirty Martini for the most part but The Petey was pretty Unique and tasty. We also started off by ordering the Cheese Curd's with Jalapeno's and Sriacha Aioli off of nightly special and they were perfection! Light and fluffy with the perfect kick from the deep fried Jalapeno's. And with perfect timing our Entrees were delivered. After much thought we had finally decided to try the Rotisserie-Roasted Pork and the Asiago-Crusted Halibut. The Roasted Pork was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, accompanied by a nice side of pinto beans, avocado and red onion salad, and a side of buttered tortillas. This meal was good but it was our least favorite of the 2. We fought over that last bites of the Asiago- Crusted Halibut. Halibut was seared to perfection with gold crusted outside and a fall apart inside, topped with this delicate, buttery, lemon sauce that we mopped up with every last bite. The Halibut came with a side of broccolini that was also perfectly seasoned and cooked. We could not have been more satisfied. But we decided to give the desert special for that night a try and boy was it good. Neither one of us had ever tried Butter Milk Pie before and we were not to sure what to expect. The crust was flakey and buttery with a sweet creamy kind of custard inside, topped with fresh barriers, whipped cream and what I think was home-made vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect way to end our meal.   I was so in love with this place. It was a bit of a pricey night. But the food was perfection, the guy playing on his guitar and singing was amazing. I even got his card. Preston Phillip was his name. He played all kinds of songs from Sublime to Imagine Dragons, all with his own spin on them. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable, I loved the open layout, the rustic modern decor and furniture. I can say that I don't mind spending the extra cash for a place, and a night out such as this one. I can't wait for my next date night here. We might have to try the Happy Hour next time and see what that is all about. I'm sure they won't disappoint.",

Surf and Turf. 2 of The smallest scallops I've ever seen wrapped in bacon accompanied by a really fatty filet which was small as well. We also got the special pork chop which was over cooked, small and served with sweetened sweet potatoes, just terrible. Drinks were however great!

The appetizers came out at the same time as the entrees, with the exception of the ahi tuna special, which came out about 8 minutes later, and well done.  Once the food arrived, our server never asked how anything was. We were not offered desert, and had to request split checks. There's an Outback in the same plaza. Save yourself the terrible experience, and go there instead. The service was reminiscent of fecal matter.",

My trout almandine was over salted but to a lesser degree, and was not flavorful.  Tried my daughters pork belly and it was sporadically over seasoned in places, but had decent flavor.  The grits and greens with it were good, but the bacon in the greens was over salted to point of being inedible.  Wife liked the tri tip tacos, only get 2 and a large bowl of beans.  Beans also terribly over seasoned.  Maybe kitchen had rookies with heavy salt hands working tonight, but it was really awful meal and my daughter and I did not feel well after due to the salt level.  Also because it felt like I had burned a hundred dollar bill.  Good service and atmosphere lifted rating to a 2.",

My main course was the pork belly (my favorite cut of pork) and it was \"rolling your eyes, melt in your mouth excellent\". Definitely my favorite pork belly I have eaten in the USA. Our dessert was creme brulee which was very good.  We are primarily beer drinkers and we have experienced the \"Wet snout milk stout\" only in bottles or cans in Tucson. This was the first time we had this beer on draft and it was also a superb choice for pairing with our meal.  The Salty Sow was a terrific experience from start to finish and we will return!",

    "text": "We went for Mother's Day brunch. It was awful. The buffet had appetizer sized plates, so you could only get taste portions of food. The most popular dish was chicken and waffles was put out in small portions so after 10 people got a serving it was gone and the line was backed up. The majority of the food was cold and tasteless. The bacon was plenty and looked beautiful and appetizing, but alas it was not. Tasteless and unsalted. The cost of the buffet compared to what was offered was not worth the drive nor the cost. We spent over $100 for myself and my husband but still had to stop somewhere else on the way home to get a decent, hot meal. On the up side our server was pleasant.",

    "text": "I feel the Salty Sow Falsely advertised their prices before we arrived.  I needed a place to bring our family with 3 children who eat like birds for Father's Day.  I searched the web for a reasonably priced restaurant and found that they had a buffet brunch that met my criteria.  They also offered a reasonable lunch menu, too.  Perfect.  When we arrived we received the brunch buffet menu with no prices and there was no other menu we could order from.  I asked the waitress and she quoted prices that were almost double.  We looked up their web page to check and there was no mention of a brunch at all or that they were having a special Fathers Day Brunch with much inflated prices.  Though they slightly adjusted our bill, we ended up paying almost double what was advertised.  Very disappointing.",

    "text": "FYI, Salty Sow is not very salty :) We have been there twice and loved their food both times. The restaurant has a GREAT Happy Hour.   First time, we had Firecracker Shrimp App, Good drink prices during HH. Hubby had Tito's up. Entrees: me, Chef's Vegetable Antipasto (this was amazing, roasted veg, and some arugula, but a ton of roasted veg.) Hubby had Fish & Chips, he said they quite delicious, nice & crisp.   2nd time,  Bartender told us to try 'Truffle Stuffed Eggs' (ok I'm not hard boiled egg fan but I thought I'd try these.) Very smooth & delicious, I have to admit, those eggs were gone in a second. :) Yes, they might be best in the Valley   I had Chef's Vegetable Antipasto again (it was a different night, so different veg, still delish.) Hubby had the Crispy Chicken Thighs with Smashed Potatoes, came with gravy on the side.  I was pleasantly surprised for a place named 'Salty Sow'.  Staff were very nice, families, lots of kids around.   I know we'll be back a third time.",

Saving grace were the bartenders since we had to move ourselves to the bar to be greeted as a customer.  When we informed the hostess, she had a blank stare. We saw her tell a manager and he looked at us, but did not approach us nor offered an apology.  Will we return? Not likely. We prefer being served in a timely manner.",

    "text": "I hate to give this restaurant a 3 star review because I actually did really enjoy the food. My wife and I came here for dinner and they happened to be on happy hour. We each ordered a cocktail and my Moscow mule literally just tasted like ginger beer which was upsetting because the menu made it sound really good. It did not taste like there was any alcohol in it. When I asked the server if the bartender could re make it she basically said that is standard on how they make it and I can request a double if I want. She did end up bringing me out a very small portion of vodka to add to my mule which made up for it. I ordered the chicken fingers on the happy hour menu and it was supposed to come with a biscuit. The chicken was really good but a server came out said that the biscuits were in the oven and it was going to take about 10 minutes. He let me know that he would bring me out 2 biscuits since I had to wait. Well about 20 minutes later the gentleman comes out with one biscuit that was cut in half? This was a little off putting since he let me know that he was going to bring out 2. Just a little shady. It was disappointing because the biscuit was really good and it would have went really well with the chicken. On a positive note, my wife ordered the pork belly entree and it was very delicious. The grits had good texture and the side salad with the bacon was awesome. The food was very tasty but I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed with the overall experience. Would consider going back but hopefully we can receive more transparent service next time.",

The four of us shared the Brussels sprouts and nachos to start and both dishes were delicious.  We all loved the addition of golden raisins to the Brussels and I know nachos seem like a simple dish, but they way they layered the cheese sauce meant every chip had the perfect amount.  I declared them the beset nachos I'd ever eaten!  For dinner, we ordered two courses split and they were nice enough to plate them separately, without us asking.  I love that!  Even split, we all had such generous portions.  I don't know that I LOVED the fish and chips but I did like it a lot.  This was a restaurant win!",

    "text": "Reviewing it just for the brunch, but even that totally needs the shout-out. Been looking for some basic unlimited eggs, bacon, potatoes, and all the classics, but all the hotel buffets in Scottsdale were super expensive! Man I don't need prime rib for breakfast! So I was super happy I was able to find something for $25.   You're definitely paying a little more - when you can go to all these awesome breakfast places around for dishes in the high teens. But with those places, sometimes there are some dishes better than others, or trying everything want costs a little more than you want.  At Salty Sow you're paying for the variety, and honestly every single thing I had was on point. The main stars of the porchetta and turkey was ridiculously moist and well-seasoned. The chicken and waffles - crispy yet juicy bite. And pretty much every classic breakfast staple was great, from the scramble, the pork belly hash, and an incredibly creamy cheesy grits.   If I were to get one plate at an a la carte restaurant would be phenomenal, but to have 2 or 3 all be that good is fantastic - and that's without tapping into any of the mimosas or Bloody Mary's!  Regardless of the buffet format, the taste of the food alone at Salty Sow put it at the top of breakfasts I've had in Scottsdale. Food so good that I not only will come back, but will also try their lunch/dinner as well.",

It was a spectacular array of food, a mix of southwestern and southern comfort dishes. Some items at the buffet included carved rotisserie turkey, pork loin, green chile pork, fried green tomatoes, roasted beets, green bean casserole, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and pork belly hash. There was also a wide selection of pastries and cookies for dessert.  My favorite dishes from the buffet were the green chile pork and the smoked salmon. The pork was very tender and the flavors were bold and spicy. The flour tortillas they were paired with were warm and very fresh. The salmon was very moist and soft with just the right amount of smoke flavor.  The price for the buffet was $18.95, not bad at all for the amount of food we had to choose from! We came here around 11 and it wasn't too busy either.  If I'm in a gluttonous mood I'll definitely be coming back to this buffet!",

Service was great, bartender and hostesses went out of their way to ensure customers were satisfied.  To my extreme disappointment, the treatment by Kevin (not sure if he was the Manager or GM), was not consistent with the the rest of the experience.  Before being seated at a table, I spoke to the hostess and bartenders who advised the Oregon/UofA Pac 12 Championship would be televised in their bar area.  I arrived first in my party and had the option to sit my entire party directly at the bar, or in a table with views of the tvs.  I was told not to worry, they would be more than happy to slightly shift one the tvs for an even better view from one of the available tables.  Once the game commenced, the bartender did in fact shift 1 of the 2 tvs SLIGHTLY in our direction.  Which Kevin promptly moved back and from what I can tell, reprimanded his staff.  COMPLETELY unacceptable.  Nice customer service and nice treatment of your employees who were attempting to satisfy customers.  He had a very fake and ingenuine conversation with us trying to explain, which was laughable.  I do not see the harm in a tv being moved SLIGHTLY due to a customer request and in fact the fakeness and snottiness he displayed was far worse than the act of moving the tv back.  What purpose does a tv on an adjustable stand serve if you are not going to allow it to be shifted?  Of course by this time the bar was full and there was no option for us to move to a closer view of the tvs.  In this day and age, I'm far more impressed by good customer service than I am with good food.  Customer service is the reason why I repeat visits to deserving restaurants.  I mean sure, food has to be decent, but there is no excuse for outright bad customer service and by the highest \"ranking\" employee in the restaurant.  No thank you.    This was my 2nd visit to the Salty Sow and Kevin was not present for my first experience, which was much better.  The bartenders, wait staff and hostesses were so great, that I may give the restaurant another chance, but it won't be soon and I sincerely hope that Kevin won't be there the next time to sour my experience.",

The wait staff, as always, was excellent- so I'll still rave about that.  But the food?  It just wasn't as mouth-wateringly delicious as it was before.  And to be truthful, it was actually not good.  Not good at all.    I ordered my Pork Ragout again (I had seriously had dreams about this dish since our last visit).  It was very salty.  Like, horribly salty.  My wife ordered the beef shoulder everyone raved about and couldn't even eat one bite without gagging.   Not sure if the regular chef was out sick, or what the heck happened.... but it was bad enough, that I don't think we'll be returning.  Sorry Salty Sow- but we're better off as friends.",

I work in the area and heard it was new, open for dinner only and wanted to try it out, so I took my boyfriend here for a date night and immediately when I walked in, the atmosphere was so relaxing, yet intriguing. It almost felt intimate. The place used to be a gross ass China Buffet and it's completely flipped into a superior dining atmosphere. As soon as I walked in, the hostesses were extremely kind and professional.  Amy was our server and she was very, very helpful and knew the menu very well. Anything she was unsure of that we asked about, she made sure to find us the correct answer. She helped us out with the menu and we started out with the Charcuterie board (thankfully she helped us to correctly pronounce it). I've had meat and cheese boards before (I'm a huge Postino's fan), but this board was it's own kind. They various meats and cheeses were laid out and listed on the menu and most of it was all made in-house. Extremely impressive. My only critique to this dish was that the bread was a little too thick and toasted for my spreading preference, but everything on that board was devoured. Half the items I never tried, so I felt like the Sow educated me a little and helped me to explore my pallet.  I've never seen a menu like this before and I'm told that it's always changing. I'd highly recommend this place to my friends that have more sophisticated and open minded pallets than myself. I ordered the chili rubbed tuna. The fish was perfectly seasoned and seared and I couldn't help but get a shred of the roasted tomato in every bite of the green chile grits. You could taste the chile rub on the tuna in every bite. The combination was something I'd never think of. My boyfriend got the blackened red fish and I can't speak for him, but his plate was completely cleaned.   Overall, the place was stellar! We loved our server, Amy, and we'll be going back again sometime to check out their Chef's menu tasting for only $25. What a great experience in such a wonderful location! Highly recommend this place if you're open to trying new things!",

Even though they were very busy, he took his time to explain everything and made sure that we understood all the items available at a discount.  We ordered drinks, appetizer, entrees and a dessert and the timing of the meal was perfect.  The food was wonderful, and even as busy as they were, arrived perfectly cooked.  And I loved that the bus boy did not take my plate until my hubby was done with his too (pet peeve of mine).  We were never left waiting for the \"next step\" in our meal.

I had TWO bites of the pork that I spit in a cocktail napkin out of approx 3/4 lb of meat...I anticipated fat, (I was looking forward to it actually) but this was just gross. The actual meat was so tough I couldn't chew it.  As I said, I'm super forgiving, we ALL have bad nights, but (sorry Sunday night bartender) we will NEVER go back and I will NEVER recommend it. We have tried many times to get a table since they've opened,  unsuccessfully, I should have just taken the loss.",

Had the Lamb Burger, French Dip, Duck Fat Fries and 2 different tacos. Lamb meat was stronger than what I was expecting, if I am going to spend $14 for a burger would rather go to Zinburger or the Grind. The French Dip was good but our standard for excellence is at Hillstone/Houston's. The Tacos were average but different with the Pork Belly Taco with Egg was a little dry and plain but the Suckling Pig Taco was better with the salsa. The most enjoyable item was the Duck Fat Fries which were crispy while not over cooked. Was trying to get in and out to catch a movie but could not get prompt enough service and did not make the movie in time. Have to think if I would come back again. So many other places to try out first.",

We were here yesterday for Mother's Day and we got the duck fries, Rosemary chicken from the happy hour menu for our kids, porchetta for me and the beef shoulder for my husband and some sort of chocolate truffle cake to share.  Duck fries - needed some acid! The sauce that came with it didn't help with cutting the richness of the fries and egg.  Rosemary chicken - overall it was ok, but to me it needed more flavor. It needed some sort of acid and some herb or something to cut the greasiness.  Beef shoulder - it was served a bit cold for our liking. Flavor is ok.  Porchetta - if you know me, you know I enjoy fatty food. But holy cow, I can't even eat this. Where do I begin. The pork was tender BUT needed more flavor and a bunch of acid just to cut down the fattiness. The salad that was served with it was NOT sufficient to do the job. The green pesto that was on the porchetta didn't do anything, no flavor. The pork itself did not have any flavor. I bit into the bread that came with it and it was soaking in fat. I tell you, if it was flavorful fat like bacon or something seasoned I would have eaten it BUT it's not.   Chocolate truffle cake - this is the only thing I gave this place 1 star.   I am so disappointed since I was the one who picked this place for Mother's Day, but never again.",

Service is solid. No water glass will go unfilled in my experience. Reasonably priced happy hour apps...  The bad? Servers aren't particularly helpful with recommendations. Specials of the day are plopped on the table. The menu does have fun moments and is not totally dependent on pork, but liking pork helps. Descriptions tend to be more appealing than what is actually served. A happy hour app taco served this visit was among the grossest fluid filled messes I've ever experienced in a restaurant. A doble cheeseburger had mass quantities of beef, but not much in the way of flavor. And so it goes. If the food was served in a different environment you would think it was very pricey for what it was.  Will I return? Yes, on a Thursday... when music is playing. Alcoholic consumption also enhances the experience. Perhaps the Yelp average of four stars is right, but I can't get that taco out of my mind. Oh yes. The duck fat fries. They are good, but in the end they're just above average French fries.",

Now it's a restaurant so let's talk about the food: I should have chosen something different. I got the PY salad. It did not come with everything that it states in the menu.... no almonds, only arugula and no kale or baby spinach, very few dates and minimal point Reyes blue cheese, sweet onion dressing was very tasteless.",

The service is professional and I can't remember a time when the manager didn't come over and just check to see if everything was top notch. Drinks are good, food is good, atmosphere is good. Favorite dish, the P V salad.",

First, it was a couple of cold drafts of AZ brews, both very refreshing after an 80 degree day in early February.  Then, we had the truffled deviled eggs, which are darn good!  For the meal, I had the pork chops, which came stacked 3 high, meat only (no bone), on top of smashed sweet potatoes and also came with green beans.  My wife had pork belly, which was delicious and came with grits and arugula salad.  All flavors complemented each other.  Great atmosphere added to this experience.  It is on our list when we next return to the Valley of the Sun.",

Though I try to order something different each time, if all I ate for the rest of my life were the Brussels sprouts, I would be incredibly happy. The service and the atmosphere are pretty excellent as well, it's a unique restaurant once you get inside. The patio is delightful, too. Brussels sprouts aren't the only thing that have going for them, the actual entree menu (and dessert menu) have so many options, and the thing is, they're all pretty excellent. And not to pretend for a minute that we were just coming for the food, the drink menu is creative and inspired.",

The beautiful and trendy indoor/outdoor atmosphere with excellent/mild (guitar) live music was exactly what my DH and I were looking for this evening (Sat, early, around 6:30-7:30-ish).   We planned on splitting the French Dip w/duck fat fries and the ABLT Salad. Though, once I tasted the salad, I did NOT want to share!! :) AND - I'm not typically a 'salad person' DELISH!! My only complaint would be that it was served on a very long/narrow plate. I can totally see using a cute/contemporary plate like that for apps.  It just made my fab salad a bit difficult to eat (especially w/the butter knife I was given) :(    The dip was rarer than rare, a deal-breaker for me but DH enjoyed it. The 'duck fat' fries were great! However, I honestly couldn't tell the diff from other great fries cooked in reg oil. ;)  The place was a lot larger and nicer (and busier) than I expected. Service was good. We only stopped by for an hour or so tonight before an event. I'm happy to have found a new date night spot for DH and I!",

I'm just lost on how a company can think that their food is really worth the highway robbery of a $80+ for two very small apps, two small sandwiches, and a medium bowl of salty beef shoulder? This place has decent food but is priced out like they are above the average contender.  SORRY guys... not so much.    On a positive side note the waitress on this nice Thursday night was a good worker and Pleasant.

Choose wisely though, it is AZ and hot!  The service here is wonderful and the food is great. Portion size is definitely large. The menu features a wide selection of entrees and great appetizers. For me the surprise standout was the Brussels Sprout salad (I got mine with no dressing). It is such a wonderful combination of flavors and crunch, you wish it was twice the size!  There is a full bar and decent wine and beer list for a restaurant of this type.  The dessert menu was a little on the small side for my tastes but overall I like that the menu was clear and had a reasonable number of choices not pages of choices.  All the staff was very helpful, the chef came out and checked on our meals, the owner or manager came by and chatted with us for quite some time and was a wealth of knowledge. My only real disappointment is that I don't live here so I can't come and eat here more often!",

This time we arrived at 11am and everything was dried out and overcooked due to it siting in the pans/dishes being kept warm, the bacon was mostly burned (although a new batch had been placed out by the time we were preparing to leave after noon), the french toast was dried out, the chicken was dry, the biscuits were hard, just a toal embarassment.  The service is always great here and if I could I would add a half star for that but I don't think my family will be taking my recommendations on where to eat any time soon after this disaster.",

We were looking for something a little bit different with great food that didn't have a terribly pretentious feel like so many other \"foodie spots\" The Salty Sow is just that!   I did a burger and my wife did the ribeye tacos, both of which were amazing. We sat outside and the atmosphere was great. Service was attentive without being overbearing and the food came out promptly and perfectly cooked.   I would definitely recommend this as a spot to anyone looking for something a bit different whose been to all of the usual spots in PHX.",

We waited 15 minutes past our quoted wait time (which was 45 minutes to begin with) and then we waited ANOTHER 15 minutes just to have a server come by to take our drink and appetizer order.   After ordering our appetizers and then dinner shortly after, we waited another 20 or more minutes to have our entrees served BEFORE our appetizers.  Our server said she would take the appetizers off the bill. - super nice gesture!  The bill came... appetizers were on the bill... can you say awkward? Then we had to be those people to ask them to remove them. The desert and dinner were bomb, would maybe go back because the food was good but would definitely hope for better service.",

    "text": "I took my dad here for Father's Day after discovering their happy hour on the Whistl app for iPhone. What a great find!  We started with a couple drinks. My dad got one of their local craft brews ($4) which he enjoyed very much. I was a little more adventurous and tried the Maple Old Fashioned ($6). It was excellent. It wasn't too sweet, and the maple added a nice subtle flavor that complimented this iconic drink very well. The single massive ice cube was a nice touch, allowing me to sip it through the meal without having to worry about it being watered down.   We got a couple happy hour items along with the drinks. We tried the Spit Roasted Suckling Pig Taco with sweet onion slaw, pickled onions, smoked tomato salsa, and cilantro aioli. It was huge! One could almost be a meal in itself. It was delicious. Definitely one of the best tacos I've ever had. The toppings really added to the savory flavor of the pork. We also had the  Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken a with Cat Head sweet potato biscuit, as recommended by our wonderful waitress. It came with a couple massive pieces of fried chicken bathing in a thick, delicious gravy.  The chicken was very juicy, and not greasy at all. We would definitely get this again.  For dinner, my dad got the Crispy Skin Salmon with lentils, thin beans, red wine sauce, and i asked the waitress what their best swine was. She recommended the  Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder with white beans, escarole and Pecorino. My dad really enjoyed the salmon. It was pretty much what you'd expect from a nice piece of salmon, mild in flavor, very fresh, nice natural color. The pork shoulder was also really good. It sat in a sauce with the beans, escarole and Pecorino, letting me take a bite with each of the other things. The meat was very succulent, and paired my old fashioned quite nicely.  We will definitely be coming back to this restaurant very soon. If you're a foodie like me and always looking for a great place with food at a great price, definitely check out the Whistl app for Phone!  Happy Eatings",

There was a great variety of breakfast/lunch food and the price was so reasonable.  Almost better than the food was the service.  The hostesses, our waiter, other waiters, all of the chefs (it is an open concept kitchen so you can chat with the chefs) were OVER THE TOP friendly and accommodating.  I can not wait to go back for dinner very soon as I hear the dinner is even better - not sure how that can be possible.  You should try this restaurant!!",

Anyways this burger was amazing. Perfectly Juicy, meat to bun, perfect. cheese to meat perfect. Fries...thats what stopped a five star. They were good, but couldn't line up to the rest of the food we had. (a little bit of a let down)  My wife had the beef shoulder. It was served in its own pan. We loved the aesthetic that  added to our dining experience. The servers were knowledgeable and had the perfect balance of visiting your table and letting you eat.  I will come back to salty sow for SURE!",

We had originally planned on going to another place but it was closed for the 4th of July weekend so we settled on the Salty Sow (first timers). We really like the atmosphere in this place, great decor with all the fat pig paintings and terrific service. We sort of tried multiple dishes such as the charcuterie tablet, they were all very good, and very reasonable for the price. Overall a great place to go if you are in the mood for some good food and a good time.",

We had bone marrow with herbs arugula to spread on toasted bread that I will have again for sure since it's hard to find; the milk braised pork shoulder with white beans and escarole that was SO flavorable and the pork could not have been more tender; pickled red and golden beets with goat cheese and pistachios that I will now do at home because adding the goat cheese and pistachios will make them so much more inviting to a lot of people who won't try beets; crisped brussel sprout leaves that are so unique..... and a salted caramel with sweet creme fraiche.... the Williamette Pinot Noir was a good price too...   This place could not get any better!!!!!  Loved out seating; Beth the manager who checked with us many times; Brenda our waitress who was excellent and another manager spoke to us as we left.

    "text": "Not terrible but very expensive and a bit of an odd presentation.  I stopped in for lunch the other day and sat at the bar.  I found the menu a bit confusing but finally settled on the porkbelly with collard greens.    It arrived quickly.  The plate was a 5 inch square plate with what was perhaps a 3 oz. piece of porkbelly sitting on top of about a cup of collard greens.  For $12.00.  What was odd, was the porkbelly was sitting in a good half inch of the liquid from the greens, but all I was given was a fork to eat it with and there was also no bread.  Did I mention it was $12.00?  At lunch? I asked for some bread and they brought it out quickly.  The pork belly was pretty good although a bit on the dry side.  The collards were just fine but it's hard to mess up collard greens isn't it?  I asked for the menu again and now I noticed that everything is a la carte, even on the lunch menu.  So I guess I was supposed to order a side of potatoes for an additional six bucks.    As another Yelper has pointed out, this is after all a restaurant sitting in front of the Walmart so this all seems a bit pretentious.  Look, I don't mind paying for good food in the least but I do object to being presented with a tapas sized portion when I order an entree, particularly when it is involving such low food cost items as pork belly and collard greens.  Seriously, come on guys, what is your food cost on this dish?  I'll guarantee you it's under two bucks.  In my book, that's a rip-off.    Anyway, I'm not really sure Paradise Valley needs such a precious restaurant but I guess time will tell.   I left hungry and $16.00 poorer.  Finally, I don't get this recent bizarre and unwelcome trend I've observed recently of nice (and expensive) restaurants not serving bread .  What's up with that?  If you're going to serve traditional European/American food and charge a lot of money, bring some nice artisan bread to the table.",

    "text": "We live in the neighborhood and decided to finally give this a try.  The menu isn't that much different from when my mom was growing up in the midwest on the farm, so the selection was familiar with her.  The building is beautifully done.  Very pleasant inside and comfortable ambience. The open concept kitchen is something we both like and enjoy watching.    Service wasn't too quick considering the number of employees on the floor.  We were in an hour before dinner rush with few patrons seated.  There seemed to be a mix up with servers, I am assuming because the server assigned to our table was running late and they didn't know if he was showing.  When he got on the floor, he seemed nervous but very nice and informative.  I ordered a salad which cost $13 and my dinner partner had the roast beef sandwich which was $14.  Food was good but nothing spectacular and terribly overpriced, esp for the size portion.  We opted for a dessert of the strawberry cornmeal shortcake.  Again, for $6.50 greatly overpriced for strawberries, whipped cream, and a piece of cornmeal bread.   The one thing that really put us off was the server constantly having to move his hair out of his eye and he kept wiping his mouth, I think because of how much he was sweating.  Touching your hair and face w/out washing your hands is a big no-no in the food industry.  He proceeds to brings us silverware and keeps our drinks full with disgusting hands.  We also watched one of the female servers as she kept getting the hair out of her eyes.  A revisit to food handlers policies is warranted.  Truly unappetising - we didn't want to touch much.  Both of us washed our hands as soon as we got home.  We were quite un-impressed with the entire experience.  Something I guess comes with the territory when there is 30 + years of food industry experience between my dinner partner and I.  We pay attention to detail and the little things.  I give 3 stars only because our main meal had a good taste.  We both agreed the over-priced menu and the unsanitary practices of the servers deemed it not worth returning.",

That being said, I was excited about the restaurant in general and I liked it.  It has a very cool vibe, which is lacking in the PV mall area, so this very much appreciated.  Also, all of the food we ordered was great!  We were there for happy hour and we did not get the tacos, I think they were $5 each for one small taco, that seems too pricey!  I think in the Phoenix/Scottsdale market, other similar restaurants are a little more competitive with their pricing. Overall, I know I will be back, but maybe not as often since it is a little pricey.  I also agree with the other reviewer who said there should be a kids menu!",

    "text": "Great dinner date night spot!  Nice modern but cozy spot near pv- we came in at 9 pm reservation but would have been fine not to have a reservation at that time.  We were seated on the far west wall booths- was not too loud in the restaurant as it was not very busy.  I had the Blanche royale margarita which is the house blood orange margarita with Chambord and the hubs had a beer.  Once he tried my margarita he said he wished he had gotten a marg too!   We started with the chorizo mushrooms and that was a great bite!! Loved the 6 yummy mushrooms and bread to soak the oil up.  Unfortunately the bread didn't seem fresh. It wasn't crusty or soft- just really tough.  I'd appreciate a lighter toast... Or a grilled rustic bread instead.   We got the chefs vegetable selection which was delicious- very light and straightforward. Lightly seasoned fresh ingredients included roasted cauliflower, lentils/quinoa, arugula, brocolini, grilled Bok choi, and a raw fennel & apple salad.  The cooked ingredients were delicious but the fennel & apples would have greatly been enhanced with a light vinegarette or perhaps a dressing on the side of the tray. The plain arugula did not annoy me as much but still would have benefitted from a dipping sauce option.  We also had the farm salad I think it was.  I remember the chewy bacon and creamy dressing.  Overall good but not outstanding.  Our server was very nice and professional.  We most likely will be back again to sample more menu items.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with my dinner this past Saturday night.  We waited at the bar until our table was ready.  The bar service was excellent and the bartender (a lovely lady) was attentive, funny and fast.   We only waited 15 minutes before our table was ready.  Our new server was quiet and shy, but otherwise friendly.  We ordered Fried Smashed Potatoes which were delicious and I ordered the Asiago-Crusted Halibut while my boyfriend ordered the PV salad and modified it with fried chicken.  Everything was going well until I noticed halfway through my dish a lovely piece of hair on the top of the sauce on my fish.  Immediately disgusted, I stopped eating the fish but I was still hungry so I decided to finish the smashed potatoes.  Really sad that this happened.  We're not ones for complaining and to be honest our waitress was busy attending to a 10 person party at the next table so we barely saw her after she gave us our check.  We paid cash and left.  Unfortunately, I will never return here.  Gave it two stars because the bartender service was great.  Maybe the kitchen needs to invest in hairnets?",

We got there at 7:30 on a Sunday evening and the porchetta and roasted pork were both sold out.   Disappointing considering they only opened at 4pm.    We tried: Duck fries: it was okay,  nothing special.   The best part was the sauce.   The eggs over the fries seemed a bit overcooked.  It didn't run at all.   Bone marrow: again,  it tasted good,  but wasn't phenomenal at all.  Brussel sprouts caesar salad: this was actually the winner of the meal.   The nutty taste from the roasted brussel sprouts really paired well with the craisins and light caesar dressing.  I would totally get this again.   Pork belly: I am usually a huge fan of pork belly,  but this was disappointing.   It was just an oily slab of fat that left a slick layer of grease on my plate.  When it's done right,  it's tender and the meat and fat melts in your mouth.   This just didn't do that.   The salad that accompanied it was actually nice,  but the pork bits are REALLY salty and you'd probably do better with just half of a piece per bite.

    "text": "There's one sure-fire way to get me into a restaurant, and that is to serve a lamb burger.  On the red meat scale, lamb may not rate as highly as elk or venison, but it certainly beats out boring old beef.  Want a way to give your boring hamburgers a little bounce?  Make it out of lamb.  So, of course, I had to try this place out.  I arrived during the peak of the Saturday dinner rush (either that or this place is doing very, very well), and sat at the bar.  This gave me a perfect vantage point to view all the goings-on - the drink preparation, the hustle and bustle in a fast-moving kitchen, all the pomp and pretense of the well-to-do north Scottsdale crowd.  This is clearly the most happening evening spot in the immediate vicinity.  When my juicy, medium-rare lamb burger and duck fat fries arrived in front of me, I immediately transformed into a vulture.  I drooled over my plate, my sensibilities comprised of satisfaction laced with empathy for my fallen prey.  It would be impossible to portray the restraint it took to pace myself.  I wanted to savor it, but I could not wait for the next bite.  As the juices from the impeccably cooked ground lamb splashed upon my plate, adding an extra level to the flavor profile of my duck fat fries, I reflected on the handful of lamb burgers I had previously enjoyed.  This one was definitely one of the best, if not the very best.  It may even beat out that excellent lamb burger I had in Portland.  I will admit, I have only eaten at Salty Sow but once, and it may seem premature to declare a verdict on a place after one visit.  But one a place serves up such an excellent lamb burger, and there aren't any glaring problems with the dining experience, it deserves credit.  This place is worth a visit or five.",

An open kitchen gets me every time.  We sat at a long butcher-block type table.  I'm from Chicago, and it reminded me of Girl & the Goat and Publican, with the big pictures of pigs on the walls and rustic decor.  The menu was fantastic.  Happy Hours abound in the Phoenix area, apparently, because we were able to once again score half priced appetizers and deals on drinks.  Beverages were delicious - I have somewhat of an obsession with Moscow Mule's - Salty Sow has their own take on it which was absolutely fantastic.  We had a large group and I'm unsure of what everyone ordered, but I can tell you what the BF and I got:  :: Truffled Deviled Eggs with Salty Sow bacon.  Savory but not too heavy.  Perfect combination of flavors, and on the happy hour menu! ::Roasted Organic Beets salad.  Whipped goat cheese, pistachio vinaigrette.  This was heavenly.  The goat cheese and pistachios paired perfectly with red and golden beets. :: Bacon & Eggs.  Candied pork belly, stone-ground white corn cheese grits, fried egg, whol-grain mustard jus.  This was my dish.  The only thing that I didn't LOVE about it was the jus.  However, once I broke the yolk on the egg and married everything together, it was perfect. :: Bacon-Wrapped Pork Filet Mignon.  Sweet potato mash, apple mustard chutney, chipotle honey sauce.  His dish.  Too smoky for me in flavor, but he devoured it.  All in all, a great dinner to celebrate our friend's birthday in Phoenix.  I would absolutely return if I'm in Austin or Phoenix.",

The place only had 17 people seated and I saw no fewer than 12 people on staff.  During the course of our meal our waitress promised an ice tea refill on 3 separate occasions and only delivered on one of those.  We actually went over to the (very helpful) bartender and he filled my tea and swapped out my girlfriend's beer that tasted a bit off.  Our waitress was never around, but there were plenty of other staff just standing around the kitchen area not doing anything.   The manager seemed to mostly wander aimlessly around the perimeter of the exposed kitchen, sometimes looking at the expo tickets.  I never saw him check on any tables or do anything productive.   With the negative part out of the way...the beef shoulder roast entree and the green chili appetizer were both delicious.  If we had just seated ourselves at the bar, I believe this likely would have been a 4, if not 5, star experience.",

If you can get in Michael's section you will be very happy as he takes his job very seriously yet is always smiling and makes even the mundane task of reciting the specials a fun culinary adventure.  2) pomegranate mojito - so refreshing on a hot summer day.  3) duck fat fries - need I say more?  4) chicken thighs with neck bone gravy - you MUST taste this dish!  5) smashed fingerling potatoes - so smart, so simple, yet no one else has ever thought of this...order this please.  6) tomatoes with homemade ricotta - I could devour a plate of these all by myself...almost did...but I had to be \"polite\" and share them with my dinner mates. Next time I want my own.  7) rib eye steak - order it rare plus for THE most tasty steak!  8) elevated booths with foot rails - by far the most comfortable seating.   9) atmosphere - I LOVE the decor and the comfort this place offers. So cool, you won't feel like you are in a shopping center rather you WILL feel like you are in the hippest locale with beautiful people all around you.  They are all lovin the food and the atmosphere.  10) in short, even if you are not a pork lover, like one of the members in our party, no worries...as the menu has everything to offer and although its called \"Salty Sow\" rest assured you will find many things to love on this menu.",

It was nice to see the local Sun Up brew at a restaurant here in town. I ordered a $12 cheeseburger and asked them to hold the mustard. Of course it arrived covered in mustard. How can you taste anything when it is overpowered by mustard? I returned the cheeseburger and waited for the replacement. The manager was kind enough to bring me a couple deviled eggs while I waited. I tried one but all I could taste was lemon juice. When the replacement burger arrived, It was immediately evident that the cooks had gotten revenge. The patties were burnt beyond any recognition. I had never got to have a burger and the waitress had the Gaul to charge me for it. I won't go back. There are too many places that make good food and care.",

I selected the crispy chicken thighs. They were pan fried without a batter and served on top of fingerling potatoes with an incredible gravy. This dish would pale in comparison to the size of franchise restaurants, however, I could not finish the serving. I believe the richness of the gravy, the perfect saltiness of the potatoes, and the crispness of the chicken made for a satisfying and filling dish. I am looking forwards to my lunch of leftovers tomorrow. Hubby had their Sunday night pork specialty. The pork was juicy and served with fingerlings and garlic toast. With determination he finished his entree with the exception of all the bread. We shared a piece of brown butter cake which was okay. Not great, not bad, but not good enough to order again.",

I had never tried pork belly before and decided to branch out and am very glad that I did. I honestly don't think I'll eat pork belly anywhere else in fear that it would just not compare.

We had to wait for a table in the bar area for 30 mins in order to get the happy hour specials (not worth the $5 total savings). We sat at the bar while we waited for our table. The bartender was slow but our beers were cold so it was alright. Once we were seated we already knew our orders. Our server initially came over pretty quickly and was able to get our order in. Our food came out quickly, about 15 mins or so, and was really good! We both had tacos!  After that, the server came over and asked if we wanted a dessert menu, which we did.  It only took a few mins to decide but sadly our server never came back to take our order. We waited over 20-25 mins and finally flagged down someone cleaning a table behind us to just get our check so we could leave and skip the dessert. The food here is good but we will not be returning bc the service is just subpar and the food is overpriced.",

The staff was so accommodating, Mimosas and water flowed, constant rotation of new plates and utensils, and an awesome menu.  From my understanding, the menu changes. That's a good thing because we all plan to visit again.    This past Sunday, November 19, 2017 we had a chance to indulge in the following: Veggie Scramble, Green Chili Pork with tortillas, Caramelized Banana French Toast, Cheese Grits, Pork Belly Hash, Sausage, Bacon, Smoked Salmon, Honey Glazed Chicken and Waffles, Roasted Turkey with Gravy, Pork Belly Stuffed with Chorizo, Fried Green Tomatoes with Fresh Guacamole, Brussels Sprouts Cesar Salad, Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese and Pecans, fresh fruit, yogurt with granola, brownies, cookies, pastries and bagels.  All of that for $20 bucks!  I tried just about everything.  Everything was delicious ... however, because it's buffet style, some food items got cold quick!  You almost have to watch for the cooks to put new items out so that you can quickly get the food hot and fresh.    Out of 12 of us, here were some of our favorites: Veggie Scramble, Green Chili Pork with tortillas, Cheese Grits, Smoked Salmon, Honey Glazed Chicken and Waffles, Pork Belly Stuffed with Chorizo, Fried Green Tomatoes, Roasted Beets and the soft baked cookies. They were so soft and moist, delish!  Just a little note: The cookies look like they were chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin, possibly coconut in them.  I asked one of the cooks if the cookies had coconut in them.  He said I don't think so, no, no they don't.  Great!  I grabbed 2.  Upon first bite, coconut!  Glad I wasn't allergic.    The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Chicken and Waffles.  I thought it was dry and cold every time I tried it (3 times).  Others loved it.  No one tried the Bloody Mary's but the Mimosas were sooooo damn good.  We can't wait to go back.  Salty Sow is definitely a crowd pleaser!",

We sat at a booth on the perimeter wall and enjoyed the views. The patio looks like a great option for warmer weather.  The medium rare burger was tasty and juicy. The French Dip was also pretty good - the best part being the au jus (which boasted a pleasantly salty blend of mushroom, onion on beef broth flavors). The meat was not as tender as I thought it would be. We'd also prefer it with a sturdier bun that doesn't \"melt\" down as quickly when dipped. The fried green tomatoes were tasty as well - never experienced with guacamole before, but we liked the variation.  THE STAR of the show were the Banana's Foster Beignets - YUM! Four to a serving makes it perfect for sharing with 3-4 people. Served hot and perfectly stuffed with a blend of bananas and cream cheese (not too much- like a crab rangoon- or too little- to leave you wanting more). The honey drizzle and creamy vanilla ice cream were THE perfect complement. Honey on ice cream is now a new fav!  Would like to come back for HH apps.",

The tortillas were hot and the stew was really tasty.  It was just a little spicy.  My young daughter ate some of it too so you know it can't be that spicy.  The girls thought the deviled eggs were too salty.  I had one and liked it.  The bacon pieces were a nice touch but I think they should use more.   The chicken sandwich I had was really good.

We asked for suggestions and recommendations and received both as to the food and drinks.  Since there were a few of us, we ordered from the happy hour menu the deviled eggs, the duck fries topped with an over easy egg and I think bearnaise sauce, the eggplant frites, the fried chicken and biscuit, fish taco, shrimp cocktail.  For our drinks we had the blanche royale, maple glazed old fashion, cosmo, and blanche margarita along with an ale.  I had the old fashion and agreed it was very good.   With the maple syrup in it, I thought it would be maple syrupy.   Not at all.   Yumms!  Okay.   Straight up, I'll say that I am not a fried food kinda gal, but the food was good.  I ate the deviled egg (I know.   It's not fried), the duck fries, the fried chicken and biscuit and the eggplant frites.   If I was a fried food kinda gal, yep, I'd say it was very good.     For dessert, for our birthday gal, we shared the bananas foster, which was again fried, but accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Go.   The happy hour pricing is great.   For the rest of October, there is a buy one/get one free lunch.   Since they have more than just the fried food for lunch, I'd try their lunch.",

This was a fantastic choice, the ambiance was great and the restaurant was immaculate without being too fussy.  As per usual, we started with several appetizers Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Shrimp Cocktail \"Stuffed\" Avocado, and House-Made Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms.  The fries were pretty good, a little greasy, the Deviled Eggs were good, but to be fair, not as good as my mom's.  Now, the House-Made Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms were the highlight of the meal.  I could have ordered a round or two of these as my meal.    As this was the last meal during our travels and I had already had quite the food tour, I decided this was a good night for salad.  I ordered the A.B.L.T. and I was not disappointed.  The Salty Sow Bacon and avocado made for a fantastic combination with the lettuce and tomato.  I visit again on another trip where I actually have an appetite.",

As you can guess by considering the name, there are some great bacon and pork dishes though by no means does that mean there are no options for you should you not eat bacon/pork or even meat.  There are some great salads, vegetables, and fish.    Happy hour is daily from 4:30-6:30 PM.  $2 off signature sips and wells, $5 happy hour wine, and $5 or $7 bites, which are honestly quite filling if you get a few of them to share.  The signature sips are very creatively put together and quite tasty, and my favorite sharable side dishes during happy hour include truffled deviled eggs and honey rosemary dipped fried chicken (complete with a biscuit).    You can make a reservation using Open Table though more often than not, there is a table available even if just at the bar.  Other fun facts.  There are two other locations in Austin (Texas), which is one of my favorite cities!   There is also a rewards program that I have yet to figure out but the website makes reference to.  Salty Sow is also part of the same family of restaurants as Roaring Fork in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I love this place. But my last visit was far from the normal and has left me upset. It has been a while since we visited our favorite restaurant in Phoenix! So it seems some things have changed. There are 3 glaring issues I cannot reconcile.  1. Our waiter was not ready to be alone. He was out of his league. Nice guy and trying hard, but not yet up to par for Salty. He was just missing on many levels, from drinks to meal to cleanliness.   2. There was a drunken party of like 70 people on the patio, which is awesome and fine, I was a bit jealous TBH. They were having fun, but you sat us right next to them. C'mon... I couldn't hear a thing... The whole restaurant is open. Sit us away from that so we can enjoy our meal.   This is where I really lost my cool and left very unhappy...  3. You sat us at a very tall bar like table, again this is fine by itself, I actually prefer it. But, I have a 3 year old kid. I asked for a high chair and the waiter didn't bring it or couldn't find it. Lots of time went by, like at least a half hour, waiting for her highchair. Then... MY DAUGHTER FELL OFF OF HER CHAIR RIGHT ON HER FACE!!!  These chairs are like 4 feet off the ground... I was so mad. Then miraculously a highchair is available. I know you may be thinking \"Well take care of your kid, guy.\" and you would be right. She is ultimately my responsibility, hence the request for something to strap her in to. But anyone with kids knows that they like to be like the family, have their own seat and do their own things. My daughters are very independent and I am not going to hold her all night, she would be miserable.  I am just happy that she didn't get hurt, because then we would have a completely different story on our hands.  This oversight has left me jaded, the complete lack of care and customer service is very unlike Salty. I have been here at least 12 times, checked in only half the times, brought and recommended this place to many people and not sure I feel the same after this; kinda sad.",

Our waiter was nice but clueless on the basics, we ordered the prime rib which was their \"go to\" and it came out cold, my girlfriend ordered the French dip with fries and that too came out cold with the fries being soggy!!   We asked 3 times if there were a possibility of reservations on Mother's Day and the manager was supposed to come by and never did.   Leaving the server finally said \"come in and sit at the bar\".   Ok bud, let bring my mom in and sit at the bar with my family?!  Disappointed and not professional....serving isn't hard people I did it threw college.",

First let's start off with the Bloody Mary bar: three kinds of tomato juice, five types of stuffed olives, thick bacon strips, pickled everything lol including squash, asparagus, peppers, carrots, green beans, onions, and cucumbers, fifteen different hot sauces, horseradish and a few more things I can't remember........ The brunch buffet had smoked salmon, turkey breast and pork tenderloin. Sides including cheese grits, green bean casserole, sliced organic beets, fried green tomatoes, cranberry Cesar salad. Bakery goods including bagels, biscuits, pastries, cookies and brownies. They also had eggs and omelettes to order.  There were more items that I didn't mention. The food was DELISH and flavorful. The interior decor was clean with a modern woody farm fresh look! There is a patio, but I didn't get to check it out.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a casual and very yummy Sunday brunch.",

I don't even like Brussels sprouts!    The cocktails are pretty descent here too...along with the chocolate truffle cake!! Maybe someday I will get myself to order something else; I am sure many other items on the menu are just as delicious!",

Went in for dinner late night once and was sat with back to host stand and could hear all the drama and bitching going on between them. The food was in fact tasty but not worth the $127 bill for the two of us. I would go in again for happy hour on a random week day but I don't think I would be back for an actual meal. I would also suggest they fix that table behind the host and put a better barrier up or get rid of the table all together. It's just unprofessional for the teenage hosts to be gossiping the entire shift while ears are close by listening.",

Everything was wonderful, starting with the ambiance and waitress, and of course the food.

I also ordered the filet mignon and it hands down beat Flemings. The beef itself was flavorful and the sear was perfect. Mashed potatoes with a rustc flair and crispy, not oily onion strings and a flavorful Demi glace finished the plate. I also had the Butterscotch Bourdino for desert...wow.   Everyone from the bartender to the busboy and most importantly my waitress were upbeat and seemed to love working here. I had a great experience and highly recommend Salty Sow",

    "text": "Why, oh why, did we wait a whole year into moving here before trying out this place? You mean we could have been eating here for a WHOLE year by now?? Well, on the up side we did end up eating here and fell in love. We were directed this way via Yelp (of course) and the high volume of positive reviews - which obviously weren't lyin'.   Knowing we wanted to try somewhere new, and diligently trying to check places off of our ever growing \"bookmark\" lists, this place popped up since we were at the Paradise Valley Mall, which is conveniently right across the street. Parked the car, and headed around the corner to the front entry way.   Once inside the place oozed ambiance and the decor went from classy, high-end styled seats, to folksy art pig paintings on the wall and Edison-esque lighting. We  were ushered to a half booth, half high-top table spot close to the bar and our waitress (and her amazing trainee for the evening) greeted us pretty instantly. Menus were handed over and briefly explained. We were lucky enough to hit them for happy hour - which is seven, yes SEVEN, days a week! Whoo! That's a big win for us since during the work week it's difficult for me to get out of work in time for most happy hour offerings.  When our waitress and trainee returned to the table, we explained that we were total noobs to this whole gig and she quickly offered up suggestions from apps, to drinks, to happy hour \"must-try\" small bites. We opted for the truffled deviled eggs app, my drink was the The Petey, his was a standard rum and coke, a so-called \"small\" plate of honey rosemary dipped fried chicken, a spit-roasted pork taco, and finally, a beef shoulder taco...all of the food was on the $5/each happy hour menu! I mean...it's $5...  Eggs = holy cow, best deviled eggs...ever. The salty-bacon bits inside of the delectable truffle mix filling was unreal good. My drink came as a recommendation from the waitress and it was an amazing blend of refreshing citrus and mint along with a touch of tart grapefruit vodka and agave. The fried chicken and tacos, while supposedly \"small\" plates, were full on meals in and of themselves. The chicken was two full-sized large tenders smothered in what I can only say is honey sauce from heaven. The tacos were stuffed to the brim with meat and toppings. The pork and steak were done perfectly and the toppings, while plentiful, weren't added on to the point of being distracting from the meat, which is the point of a taco...am I right??  Finally - and go ahead and judge our gluttony here, cause we are totally NOT regretful at all on this - we had TWO desserts, cause, we really honestly could not decide on just one. We went for the bananas foster beignets and the truffle chocolate cake. Seriously tell me you could pick just one of those...go ahead...I'll wait....  Once they arrived, we did for half of a second regret ordering two cause these babies were ginormous offerings of dessert, for an extremely reasonable price point. The chocolate was my fave, but I'm a chocolate lover. That being said, if we had only ordered the banana dessert, I would have been completely happy.  Overall: A+ A-wait for it-mazing food. Great service from start to finish. Strong drinks. Happy hour ALL week long with great prices. BAM! We'll be back, no question there.",

    "text": "So, my wife has a class today and informs me that I am in charge of dinner. It is too hot to grill outside, so I asked if I could take her to a nice restaurant? Her eyes popped and said she had heard of a new one in the valley called the Salty Sow. We did a little checking (Yelp) and I was in. Just to make sure we made a reservation on line.  Generally, I don't get too excited about a restaurant, but I have to tell you, we had a great experience. From the time we walked through the door to time we left with a smile on our face we were treated like old friends. Tony, our waiter, was attentive and helpful. Our table was cleaned twice while we were there, and I am not a messy eater.   We started with the \"Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves\". Wonderfully unique and very tasty. I had the \"Beef Shoulder Slow-Cooked\". It was melt-in-your mouth tender. They gave me a knife, but I think I only used it once. The beef was served on \"Smashed Potatoes\" and veggies and then topped with a fried egg. So good!  My wife had the Halibut. She took one bite and immediate wanted to give me a taste. I feel a little bad, I did not make the same offer. The fish seasoned in a way I had never experienced. It was exceptional.  We shared a butterscotch/caramel desert. A perfect end to our meal. We will be returning to the Salty Sow. I highly recommend it!",

So, when my husband and I had a chance to get away for a meal, I naturally chose Salty Sow.  I wish that I could talk about the wonderful dishes that I had, but they were all only okay.  I had the candied pork belly.  I guess in my head I pictures something somewhat crispy.  I was very wrong.  It's a braised dish.  It's not a bad dish, just not something I would convince me to come back again.  My husband had the lamb burger and I had to sample.  It was pretty good if you enjoy tapenade. It's not really for me.    Service was good up until we asked for the check.  It felt like a lifetime before it finally arrived, and then it was wrong.  Overall, it was an okay experience.",

We split the truffle deviled eggs, honey crispy chicken, and Louisiana bousin fritters. The fritters weren't my favorite, oh well, my husband had no problem eating them. The chicken was delicious, I especially loved the gravy and biscuit. The eggs were very tasty. The quality of food is very high and the chef truly is an artist.",

The sauce from the pork belly was sent straight from heaven. finally some pudding and the bananas foster  , which is anything but standard, lil bananas hot stuffed donut things.. noms noms!

I come from SoCal, where a handful of restaurants there have BOMB Duck Fat Fries, and after moving here, I've been misssssssing me some Duck Fat Fries.... And though Salty Sow was unique about it with their long-minute cooked/poached eggs... They were a bit disappointing. There wasn't that unique Duck Fat flavoring.. They honestly just tasted like fries with egg. Darn! I'm sad again!   Anyways... Walking into this restaurant, it's pretty chill on the outside. Walk inside, it's pretty busy for a week night. The patio is a must-sit unless it's too hot. I really like this place's patio. Lights, plenty of seating... and they had a guy singing - who was rather good. He definitely set the kick-back mood. This place seemed like it could be a mix between Hip but Romantic/Classy-esque. I can't really pinpoint it.  I ordered the Moscato which was okay - I was hoping for a little more sweet and carbonated, but it was still good. The Chicken Thighs were tasty, especially with their \"smashed potatoes\". My date ordered the Candied Pork Belly - that's a must try as it was very tasty.  Overall, the service was really good and everyone was really nice. The manager came by to see how we were doing. The restaurant is definitely a good sight for the eyes... Ahhh them duck fat fries though! Still... I give four stars.",

The duck fries are pretty good and a nice surprise. Unfortunately, sometimes the service has the same personailty & helpfulness as a frozen uncooked french fry before it gets pizzazed up with the seasonings & fat.

When the one bar drink we ordered arrived, it was delicious but Brenda never even brought out the soda that my sister had ordered. The whole time we were waiting to order we could see her on her phone by the kitchen texting! We finally gave our order to a different server! In hindsight- we should have just left when the drinks had taken 20 minutes to come out! Unfortunately I can't even give her the benefit of the restaurant being busy- they were pretty slow for a Friday night.

On our second visit here for lunch we had pork tacos, turkey sandwich, a burger and the chicken. The burger was very juicy and very filling. Since there was no kids menu we had to get the chicken and potato's for my 2 year old but she ate it and loved it (not the entire two pieces of chicken but almost 1 whole one on her own). the tacos and sandwich were great as well. for 4 of us we paid less ten $60 for lunch, not bad considering other places we have eaten and we spend over $60 for 3 people but i guess a little pricey considering it was lunch",

    "text": "Met up with a good friend recently for some beverages, dinner, and catch up.  This place is really nice, with a variety of seating and  a very reasonable noise level.  Our server helped us get settled in and recommended drinks and appetizers to start off with.  SS has HH every day of the week so we were able to take advantage of that pricing to try duck-fat fries, crispy Brussels-sprout leaves, a lamb burger, and a French dip sandwich.  The bar whipped us up some delicious blood orange margaritas to go with the feast.  This place has so much going for it!  The food was really wonderful, the drinks were fabulous, the service was warm and gracious, and the management stopped by to chat.  All in all, Salty Sow is a great experience.  Can't wait to try it again!",

    "text": "It has taken my wife and I far too long to try this place.  We went last Friday for happy hour / dinner, and let me tell you, this place is a welcome addition to the immediate area which is otherwise pretty depressing food-wise.  In a sea of chains this place stands out and serves up some great food and drinks.  We arrived shortly after 5pm on a Friday and the place was beginning to fill up.  The entire patio was somehow reserved so maybe they were expecting a big party or 25 people really did call ahead to get a spot.  Either way, get there early if its a nice evening and you want to sit outside or get a spot at the bar.  Anyway, we took a seat at the bar and ordered some drinks and appetizers.....  Smoky Sow Martini - Very good.  Solid pour.  I especially enjoyed the cream cheese and bacon stuffed olives  Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves = Excellent.  A highlight among the appetizers we ordered.  Pork Belly Taco = Very good but the flavor was overpowered by the egg yolk in my opinion  Eggplant Frites = Very good.  Very unique.  It almost seemed like I was stuffing something healthy in my face.  Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms = Ok.  They did have a kick though.  I hope to return soon to sample more of their apps, salads, and main dishes.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to go here at the last minute on a Friday evening when I didn't feel like cooking.  We made a reservation about an hour in advance and were seated immediately.  The decor is nice - I liked the colors, the textures, and the distressed brick.  It has an upscale gastropub feel.  There are long high top tables in the middle of the restaurant that looked like they held multiple parties of people, but we were seated in a booth.  The booths were very private, which we really liked.  We got there at the tail end of happy hour, so we ordered our drinks and appetizers immediately.  We had the pork belly taco and the duck fat fries.  Both were excellent, and honestly if I had just ordered two tacos and the fries to myself it would have been the perfect meal.  I'll definitely return for the taco.  For dinner my husband had slow-cooked beef shoulder and I had the bacon-wrapped pork filet mignon.  My husband's meal was better.  Mine was fine, but the whole dish was just a little too sweet for my liking.  After the smoky, meaty pork belly taco, I was wanting something similar in taste.  I would get something different next time.  We also had the bananas foster beignets for dessert.  They were soooo good!    All in all, I will definitely return to the Salty Sow.  It wasn't the best meal I've ever had in Phoenix, but it was still excellent - from ambiance, to service, to food - and I can't wait to come back and sample some more of the menu.",

As soon as we sat down the waitress tried to get us in for the tail end of happy hour which put a smile on my face immediately. My wife, our friend and I  ordered a couple signature cocktails a beef shoulder taco and some deviled eggs. The taco was tender, flavorful and surprisingly big! The only downer to this mouthwatering side was that there was only 1 of them for a $5 price tag, but it was very good and  astonishingly large. I am not a huge fan of deviled eggs but I'll always try something once and I was pleasantly surprised with the small bite i took.      Now for the main coarse. I ordered the pork chop, my wife went with the french dip and we both quenched our thirsts with a couple beers. No complaints on the french dip or the pork chop but when I wasn't really feeling my beer selection the waitress happily exchanged it for another.   Overall my impression of Salty Sow was awesome! The service was above and beyond, with a promptness that impressed my whole party. The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was very comfortable. I would absolutely come back here and I highly recommend this gastro pub to anyone looking for some delicious cocktails and good eats.",

Not sure what to expect, we arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation but were seated almost immediately. Our server, Nate, was delightful and the three course fixed menu selections covered all the bases (pork, fish, beef). The chips and guac were enough to feed a small army, and we also indulged in the deviled eggs (YUM). The service was at a comfortable pace and we really enjoyed the lighthearted banter with our server (my dad insisted that one of the chefs was out of uniform because his \"ninja headband\" was a different color than the rest of the chefs. The bone-in tenderloin was melt-in-your mouth tender and complimented nicely by the red wine sauce. Desert was the perfect finish, Berry custard cake and chocolate truffle, both delicious.  We'll be back.",

We were greeted by a very laid back but full of personality guy named Michael.  He was a fantastic server and had his own little way of doing things that was great and very comfortable, you never felt rushed and he always made sure you were satisfied.  My wife ordered one of the specials for the night, the bolognese pasta.  It was made with San Marzano tomatoes and had creamy mozzarella melted on top of it.  Delicious.  The birthday boy had the pork belly entree.  Served with corn cheese grits and a bacon-mustard dressed frisee salad.  The belly was slow cooked and tender and had a fantastic crust seared on it.  I opted for the French dip sandwich.  Excellent thinly shaved rare beef served on a brioche bun with gruyere cheese and the standard Au jus.  This was an excellent version of a popular sandwich full of flavor that was topped off with a side of duck fat fries that were so good that no ketchup or sauce was needed.  The ambiance was fantastic.  Just the right amount of light and very nice modern feel.  You can tell a lot of effort was put into the design of this place.  We will be going back sometime for sure, it sounds like they have a new fantastic brunch buffet as well!",

I never plan on visiting again so I can't say the dishes are making me want to visit. Yes I tried the Lamb burger and ugh wish I could say it was excellent, but I would rate is as good.   I like the local beers offered, even a replica of Blue Moon, but as noted with my dinner guest, wish I had a real Blue Moon to go with my pork :) It is not the same, it is a replica and the difference in flavor is noticed.   Candied pork was ok, not something I would order again.  No starch on the plate with it so make sure you order something else.   Great bar, great atmosphere, but the food is what attracted me and it was not top notch like I had hoped.",

Great Decour people at the bar and had a great vibe there must've been a slight problem at the front desk said wait to be seated but nobody arrived for around 3 to 7 minutes more around the seven minute. We were seated in a section with just several tables so I was expecting very good service. After 8 to 10 minutes a pleasant young lady sorry that we ordered glasses of wine which appeared and with a smile she said I will be back. Unfortunately she was never to return at least to our table walk by several times as we almost yelled offending other customers to get her attention but to no avail. We finally got up and left I explained to the front desk person that she should explain to her manager what happened and she laughed it off saying she would let the waitress know that she lost another customer.     By the way there was no apparent supervision of the employees which would've solve our problem right away perhaps better management is in order",

Such a pleasant atmosphere and patio.  And our server was very friendly, talkative, not rushed, and had great suggestions and opinions about the food.  My only wish is, some place would do a choose-your-own charcuterie board: maybe a board with 5 constants and then, like pizza toppings, you pick 5 more from a list. On this list I would include some more pickled things, maybe even some Korean-pickled things like kimchi, and some spicy things.",

I explained that we wanted to eat at the bar but she said she the are no open seats and she would seat us.  Once we were seated we were presented with menus.  I could only find two things that sounded appetizing.  When I asked the waiter do you have anything like a hamburger his response was no, but we do serve lamb burgers.    We finally settled on some chicken thighs and a piece of pork.  Food was good, but very expensive, and that was the happy hour menu.  I don't expect we will be back anytime soon.

Our server spilled water all over the table, brought us water a second time and was confused how we got the first sets, after 45 minutes and giving our drink orders once and our dinner orders twice we still had not seen either.  Requested a new server as we were very unsure of our servers abilities to bring us anything and we needed to leave for the airport.  New server did say he was surprised by our server as he is one of their best.  We were surprised the manger had not come to speak to us and mentioned this.  He did come over but just to ensure our current server was better.  They did knock 20% off the bill but we were shocked with how bad this experience was.  The food was okay at best.  Being a part of of an excellent group with Eddie V's and Roaring Fork we were surprised by this experience.  In fact we looked for hidden cameras wondering if we were being plunked.",

So, just by the name I was skeptical. My wife likes Pork and steak. On 07-12-13 we drove to the 48th and Cactus location. Walked in and had to sit @ the bar for a drink and then they seated us in a booth. While at the bar we commented on the fact, that as it is set up, it allows for a loud dining environment. They were busy. Friday night. We were seated, waited quite a long time before waiter came to the booth. He just finished w/ a group of 18. Manager ( Beth ) came to the booth and apologized for the delay. Very nice and pleasant, asked if we wanted an appetizer. We were going to order one, we took her suggestion and then she stated it was on the house. A nice gesture (peace offering). Made us feel more comfortable. We ate appetizer, it was very good. Our waiter was outstanding - the entree came and it was wonderful. My wife always orders red meat, I order chicken,or fish. 85% of the time my meal is cold, the timing is off and my meal sets under a light. \"Both\" meals were great and I was happy. There were 2 managers - male & female. Both came to the table to insure  fast service. They hit a home run with me. Let me say - that is very unusual for a restaurant that busy and that price point to do. Exception all around effort. It is an open kitchen / full view.",

The $16 milk braised pork shoulder was bland and very small proportion. It was a basically white beans and pork. It wouldn't be a good stew for $8. The lamb burger may have been lamb, but who could tell. Bland and boring. I'm not sure spices are allowed in the kitchen. On the good side, the building and ambiance is awesome, but that won't make up for the poor quality if food.

    "text": "After reading the good and bad reviews, my husband and I decided to try it anyway figuring at the very least, we could grab a drink and an appetizer if nothing seemed appealing to us or if it was really overpriced.  The menus had a printing date of June 2013, so I'm guessing they have adjusted their prices according to the market and the complaints. A Peach Ale from Four Peaks was $5 ($4 on reverse HH) instead of the $7 I was expecting based upon another review.  Good to know they seemingly listen to folks.  The decor/ambience is pretty awesome and fills a void this area has been lacking.  Our server was extremely friendly and on top of things (minus one thing I'll note below).  We ordered the 110-minute egg duck fat fries as an appetizer.  They were good, but you have to mix the fries into the eggs, dip the fry into the egg and then into the sauce served on the side for the flavors to mesh well.  I wouldn't dip a fry straight into the sauce. As their name indicates, the sauce is really salty on its own.  Extremely good when dipped right.  We also ordered (from the reverse happy hour menu) a pork taco and the open-faced BLT to split.  The taco (yes, only one per order) is a pretty good size and was decent.  The pork was really smoky and smoked maybe a little too long because it was on the verge of being dry.  (Sidenote- we own our own smoker and are particular about how we like our smoked meats to be.)  The open-faced BLT was too much for us.  We had to ask for a steak knife to cut through it.  It was good, but, we were pretty disappointed that the menu didn't state that it came with french fries (or any side for that matter...it appeared to be an a la carte dish)-- nor did our server bother to tell us it came with a huge portion of fries.  Why on earth would we want MORE fires when we had your 110-minute egg french fry appetizer?  We didn't even touch one of them...such a waste of food.  Had we known, we would have definitely asked to sub it out with a side salad, even if it cost an extra buck or two.  We eat pretty healthy in general and so it was our \"cheat day,\" but, it was way too much fried food on one plate, even for a cheat day.  The bacon was really crispy, which my husband liked.  I like mine more grizzly/less done.  The tomato in the BLT is a fried green tomato and is really good.  They have a great patio for Fall/Spring if you are ever in need of a good patio to enjoy the day on.  All in all, we decided we would be back but it would most likely be for happy hour drinks and an appetizer rather than an entire meal.  Not bad, but a little too much of a fried/fatty menu for us personally.  Note- there are some healthy options on the menu, but some of them have random things in them that I'd personally like to modify out.  They won't let you modify SOME of the dishes, which prevented us from ordering those specific things.  I'd recommend at least trying this spot out, though.",

Service was very good, food was interesting but sadly, what we'll remember most, is how uncomfortable the patio seating is!  They first sat us at a high top picnic-style table - benches with no backs... ladies couldn't do it!  We asked to be moved to regular tables and they graciously accommodated us...BUT the small steel chairs were actually PAINFUL to sit in!  Granted I'm 6'4\" 225 lbs... but all our friends were squirming in their seats trying to find a comfortable position... left as soon as we finished eating due to discomfort, even though we had hoped to stay and enjoy the music for a while...  The place has a cool, urban look and feel to it... but when I sit in a chair, I really don't want to FEEL it!  Hopefully, they will recognize that comfort is king when trying to get patrons to return, which is the lifeblood of any restaurant.",

    "text": "So I must say... bacon is a good thing! and the Salty Sow delivers the goods!!!  Made my first visit here last night and was extremely satisfied with the ambiance, friendly staff & great food.  The bar is welcoming for those (like myself last night) who dine alone with a couple TV's to catch some game action.  Now its not a sports bar atmosphere but when you are having a drink and some eats by yourself its nice to have the 'ol tube (did I just date myself?) to watch.  At the bar they have a great selection, although not huge, of local craft brews from brewery's around the state.  The bar tenders where, prompt and pleasant with their service.  The kitchen was equally as efficient even on a busy Saturday night - my food arrived almost to quickly.  Now speaking of the food, the menu had a wide range of interesting starters, salads and entrees - many with bacon/pork incorporated in some unique way..  I ordered the pork shoulder, and why not right?  Its the Salty SOW after all!. It was fantastic!! the right balance of fat and flavor with a complementary seasoning that worked perfectly.  I saw another bar dinner with the beef shoulder that looked amazing so on my next visit I will definitely give that a try.  Oh.. and they have a nice open patio a with a live musician that wasn't to loud but sounded great.  The Salty Sow would be a nice gathering spot for a large group of friends for sure.  I will be back!",

It sounded interesting so i wanted to give it a try. A buddy of mine wanted to grab dinner so i said lets try the salty sow. the ambiance was different, but in a good way. Sat at the bar and ordered a drink. I forgot what it was, but it wasn't too bad. Unfortunately i wasn't too hungry so i just ordered the mini lamb burger off of the happy hour menu and i also wanted to try the duck fat fries that everyone talks about. Lamb burger was pretty delicious but the duck fries werent that great. My buddy got the tacos and he that they were delicious. Hes a hard very person to please, but he was impressed as was I.  I went back again a few days later with a different buddy of mine whos in the resturant business. He ordered the tacos too and he was impressed. I had the fried chicken and it was delicious! The touch of rosemary was refreshing in the chicken.  Im surprised that a restaurant like this is in this area. I would expect it to be somewhere closer to old town, they def dont get the recognition that they deserve. Everyone ive asked that lives in AZ hasnt heard about it, the Salty Sow should do some more advertising. This place really is a a real gem and i hope they stay for a very long time.",

    "text": "Salty Sow? What the heck is a Salty Sow? Apparently (after looking it up), it's an adult female pig.  Ohhh, makes sense.  Their specialty is in PORK.  Which I regrettably did not order but will next time.   What appealed to me at the time was this crispy chicken over fried potato dish.  It was fantastic times 100.  I never had chicken this way before.  Basically its two big chicken thighs where the skin was rendered giving it a crispier texture.  The fingerling potatoes were fried and doused into brown gravy, which then completed the whole dish.  I killed it! Was sooo good!  I did manage to sample a little bit of pork belly my amigos had.  I thought it was juicy and succulent the way it ought to be.    The menu offered some really creative dishes at an affordable price.  When you sit down and gaze at the decor, you thought you might be spending in the 20s but not really.  Ranchy chic is how I would describe the decor.    Now that I finally gave them my thumbs up, I need to plan another visit.",

Our biggest complaint about the food was everything was under seasoned-which is ironic considering it's called the Salty Sow! Our waitress, Marena, was very friendly and attentive.

During Happy Hour my husband and I started with an order of the Truffled Deviled Eggs and the Blood Orange Margaritas, we enjoyed both.   For dinner I had the Pork Belly and my husband ordered the Prime Rib (a great deal at $29).  Both meals were delicious and included side dishes, we certainly left feeling full.   Now on to yesterday's Brunch.  Loved it!!!  The cost was $21.95 which included unlimited trips to the buffet.  The buffet had a wonderful selection including green chile pork stew (topped with a poached egg if you wanted), fried chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, sliced turkey with gravy, white corn cheese grits, chocolate chip French toast, fried green tomatoes w/guacamole, lots of pastries, maple cured bacon, sausage, and eggs cooked to order.  Mimosas were $4 and the Bloody Mary Bar was $5.  We both opted for the Mimosas which were in good size glasses, not like those mini-mimosas some restaurants serve.  We enjoyed our brunch on the beautiful patio and were lucky enough to have Candace as our server.  She was friendly, informative, and quick to make sure we had everything we needed.  All in all, a perfect start to our Sunday!  We'll definitely be going back for Happy Hour, Dinner, and Brunch and taking friends when they come in to town to visit.",

We already had waited 10 minutes with no one greeting the 3 of us at the table....the table next to us not only had an attentive server, but the manager stopped by a couple of times to see how they were doing and to bring out their entree's.  We agreed that we'd wait 2 more minutes before getting up and leaving.  After making eye contact with quite a few servers and bussers, as we were about to get up, our server came - without an apology, she asked what she could get us to drink.  We obliged and ordered.  After another 10 minutes, our drinks came.    For food, I ordered the beef shoulder that had a great presentation but it was a bit heavy.  I wasn't able to finish it.  My brother had the duck breast, and though I don't eat duck, he insisted I try it - it was better than my beef shoulder.  My SIL ordered the same thing I did, so nothing extra to comment on that.  The service throughout our meal was yet again, next to none.  We had to ask every time we wanted our drinks refilled - she never came by to ask how our meal was.  And when we did ask for refills, we actually felt bad because she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her.    You know how it goes....whenever you receive bad service, it's almost hard for the food to taste good - you're just so bothered by the service that it doesn't matter.  To the point you just don't want to eat anymore.  I was really excited because we finally had a \"trendy\" restaurant in our area besides all the corporate (Olive Garden, Oreganos, etc.)  restaurants, but it looks like this one isn't a winner.",

I have now heard from EVERY server that works here that they are scared of the \"chef\" (aka a glorified line cook since he cooks the same fried chicken every day) and we witnessed it first hand tonight.  I ordered the hanger steak which I have had before and normally great by the way, but tonight it was overlooked slightly so I asked the server if I could get it redone Med Rare and she went back to the open kitchen and we watched her get screamed at and berated by the \"chef\" as he threw he adult version of a temper tantrum throwing his hands in disgust that there is no way with his cooking prowess could he ever make a minor mistake.    I love the front of he house staff here outside of the male manager who decided it was his right to tell me I was wrong in how I ordered my steak.  The music on the weekend is great and normally the food is great so this review is more for the owners and internal staff not the next customer as the food is great, atmosphere is amazing, and service is outstanding.  They just have a ego problem in the kitchen forgetting that he isn't Bobby Flay and should just keep his head down and make good food without ego.",

It's really cool to have a place like this in North Scottsdale, when most of the hip new places seem to be in the Arcadia area. The stand out dish here for us is easily the Crispy Brussels Sprout leaves. They are fried up to a nice crisp and tossed with golden raisins, pecorino, and something else sweet which I couldn't put my finger on. They are LEGIT. If you don't like Brussels Sprouts, they will change your mind.   Service was A+, food was great, very nice and chic decor...overall I was extremely impressed.

We brought our two babies (under 2) with us and he was sympathetic as a fellow parent and was quick, efficient, patient, polite but never pushy to get us out of there. He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu which helped us make quick decisions to order and was right there bringing refills of any sort, the dessert menu in the middle of entrees upon request so we could try as much as possible (of course) and boxes so we could enjoy our dessert that was promptly brought out on top of entrees (upon request---eating out with 2 under 2 is so fun sometimes :)). Last but not least, the food was impeccable. We ordered items like the duck fat fries, the crispy Brussel sprouts. French dip, burger and budino. My husband and I can't wait to go back when we have a babysitter so we can take our time more next time!",

The pate was nice and the bone marrow was rich.  I had the pork belly which was nicely proportioned.  Each item I've had was just a little less than perfect but the prices were more than reasonable.    Ambiance is nice with an open kitchen that seemed to have a small chef's table.  This place has the kind of menu I like and the prices to allow me to stay all night.",

Our server, Michael was delightful, helpful, and as it was a slower night - we enjoyed chatting with him.  He steered us True and we ordered the buttermilk pie for dessert.  So so good.  And, they make a great martini to boot.    Great dinner and great job to the Salty Sow Chef and staff.",

We had his dog and Mr. Franks was graciously welcomed in.   We started with two drinks the old fashioned (his) and the sour(mine) my drink was well balanced and u could tell they used good ingredients.   We also ordered the fries. Of which were good but not as flavorful and crispy as normal. Hence the 4 stars.   I got the beetle shoulder and it's always a favorite he has the trout (I thought it was a bit greasy) and he liked it.   No dessert was ordered as we were so full but I have had the banana doughnuts and they are fantastic!   Overall a good place and a place I'll always return too.  Ps the president was there of the company and he was so friendly. Forgot our menus and to tell our server we where there lol. The service staff and us all for a great laugh from this.",

We were there with 30 mins left on happy hour so we we enjoyed the triple fried duck fat fried with a fried egg and cold bernaise, and the goat cheese fritters and a couple of drinks.  I had (on friend and server recommendation) the blood orange frozen margarita, which was pretty sour and not very orangey.  The glass of wine I had next was great. My husband had the slow cooked beef shoulder,and he said it was delicious (like a fantastic pot roast). I had the pork belly which was tender and sweet, and we split the Brussels sprout Caesar salad.  I am not a fan of citrus and there was a significant amount of lemon on the salad so I will make a point next time to ask for that to be left off.  And then because we hadn't eaten enough we had the Bananas Foster Beignets.  They were delicious. 5 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 salad, 1 desert before tax and tip was $81. Not bad.

The app and salad came out quick but our sever forgot to put our food order in and we had to wait and additional 20 minutes for entrees that is with our app being boxed up for over 10 minutes before he acknowledged to put the order in, meaning over 30 minutes for our entrees!!!!. When we finally got our entrees we were even more displeased because our steak came out almost medium well rather than medium rare. My pork filet was gross and dry.

I've had bitter eggplant before but this was very lightly breaded and dusted with parmesan.  Light and delicious! He had the French Dip which he said was the best he ever had and he's a food snob. I saw something on a yelp review about a veggie platter, and I ordered it.... it is called the chef's vegetable antipasto. I got a cutting board filled with a tiny frise salad, roasted tomatoes, carrots, and fingerling potatoes, broccolini and a delicious salad of fresh tomato, watermelon & balsamic. Everything was  perfectly seasoned and so flavorful. Our waitress, Jacki, was amazing.  Knowledgeable, sweet, and even though she had a bunch of tables our wine and water glasses never ran empty.

The GF and I started off with the Farm Salad and then the  Charcuterie Plate of meaty goodness. For our main meal, the GF got the Bone in Filet which had an amazing sauce and was cooked to perfection. I had the 10ounce Lamb Burger which was excellent as well.   To top it all off the service was excellent. Our server was very helpful in explaining menu items and giving us suggestions. Thanks, Michael, for the great service! Next time, we will save room for the bananas foster dessert",

    "text": "Are you craving something to bring you back after a long week at work?  Maybe some rosemary fried chicken?  Duck fat fries with a side of bearnaise? Or something simple like friend green tomatoes and a side of guac?  Then this is your place.  Salty So is an absolute killer, easily one of strongest choices for a great drink and a fantastic meal.     For your first visit I highly suggest sampling their appetizers.  Beyond the aforementioned items, small bites like the pork belly tacos, deviled eggs, or even the brussel sprouts are worthy of creating a full meal. On those alone you can get an idea of their flavors and not break the bank.  Although their are some \"healthier\" options the selections will lean more towards the heavy side, so if you're on a diet, you've been warned.  Adult beverage wise they serve a take on most of the old standards; old fashioned, margaritas, mules, etc.   The atmosphere is just your standard dimlit, casual vibed restaurant with an open kitchen. Nothing too exciting, unless you notice the giant slab of prime rib being sliced up near the service area, that caught my fancy. All in all if you're looking for good eats with a southern twist, check out Salty Sow.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite restaurant and I can't wait to go back. My husband and I have been here three times now and every time has been fantastic. The first time we went was during Restaurant Week. This was amazing as we got to try a lot of items we normally might not try and found some favorites.  My favorite item on the menu has got to be their rosemary chicken with honey. I have ordered it every time we've gone and every time it has been delicious. The batter is crispy and the chicken is tender. The flavors, oh the flavors. It's a little salty but also sweet from the honey. Then there's the gravy and the sweet potato biscuit. Mm. Just thinking about it makes me crave it!   My husband loved their steak - crisp outside and perfectly medium-rare inside. It comes with shoestring fries - which aren't my favorite but you can substitute any of the other sides. I've tried the cheese grits and the smashed potatoes. Both were delicious. (I'd highly recommend the smashed potatoes.)  We've tried a few of their appetizers. My favorite is the fried green tomatoes with guacamole. The guacamole is spicy and perfectly paired with the tomatoes. Additionally, we've tried the duck fat fries (fries are delicious), the bacon and gruyere crusted bone marrow (my husband really liked this), and the green chili pork stew - amazing. The stew is something I'd definitely recommend - either as an entree or to share. There is plenty!   We've tried two desserts - a Butterscotch pudding and a dark chocolate pudding with whipped cream. Both were delicious and I'd like to try more of their desserts.   Every night they have a special menu specific for that night only. Usually there is something that sounds amazing and I have to have it. Additionally, they have Happy Hour every day from 4-6:30pm and then all night on Tuesdays.   If you are ever in the area, definitely check it out! Otherwise, make a special trip because it is just that good.",

Most buffets are just slop. The food here was a much higher quality and was VERY GOOD and not dried up or old. Everything was fresh and replaced quickly.  I squealed with delight when I tasted the crunchy, sticky, sweet and flavorful boneless fried chicken. There was so much food at the buffet nobody can eat everything.  Oh Lardy...There was Porchetta, Buttered Rainbow Trout Almandine, Fried Green Tomatoes in Guacamole, Beets with Goat Cheese, Brussels Spouts Caesar Salad, Cheese Grits, Hot Skillet Egg Dish, Jumbo Asparagus, Poached Eggs, Pork Chile Verde, Prime Rib Hash, Pastries and MORE! They will even make you an omelet if you request one.  The $5.00 build your own Bloody Mary bar isn't too shabby either with lots of hot sauces to add a variety of tomato juices, fun toppers like bacon and cheese stuffed olives and more.  They offer comfortable low top booths and mostly high top booths. They have a large dog friendly patio too.  At the time of this review the Sunday Brunch Buffet cost $18.95@ and is served 10-2 on Sundays.  It ain't no slop and feel free to eat like a swine.",

Recently I saw some other reviews came in and they were for lunch!  Finally I got to try here for lunch one day.  They accept reservation via OpenTable. They weren't that busy when I arrived and I probably didn't need to make a reservation for lunch.  Menu consists of mostly southern food, but they also have limited more healthy options.  I had grilled salmon with salad for lunch and it was perfect portion size. Salmon was cooked well, moist not over cooked.  Service was good initially but after a while he started catering more to larger groups.  Nice casual ambiance, I think this place is more suitable for happy hour.",

I'd drive across town JUST to eat that...but fortunately most everything else on the menu is pretty spectacular too. I've had had fish, steak salad, and me wife has had blacked rib eye tacos and various salads. All have been pretty spot on. In fact the steak salad had about the best steak I'd ever had on a salad.   Not everything is perfect. The Brussel sprout dish wasn't anything special, and the overly hyped banana beignet dessert was way too greasy but otherwise a solid 4 star place.   Then I came for brunch buffet. Every single thing was stunningly good. Not at all the mass produced buffets you get at hotels or casinos. 5 star biscuits available to order too.   Overall. Probably my favorite restaurant in town right now.",

For our entrees I ordered the Fish and Chips and my dinner companion ordered the Pork over Mashed Potatoes. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  The meal ended with a decadent dessert, Bananas Foster Beignets, made with cane syrup, honey & nutmeg ice cream, amazing.  What a pleasurable dinning experience.

Our server was nice, but she put in the wrong order for me, which was fine, I wasn't mad and told her just bring it when it's ready. My party and I were not in a hurry . But when I finally did get my food it was raw (I ordered the salmon). She apologized and made a comment about the cooks, something like, \"did they rush it again? I told them not to rush it.\" So I'm assuming they've sent out under cooked food/salmon before. Now that everyone was done eating. I just decided to pass on getting another salmon or getting something else. The manager did comp my food and drink and offered a free dessert, which was nice. I will most likely go back again, I probably just won't order the salmon.",

However, I still give 4 stars because the honey rosemary chicken was GREAT. Definitely order that! We each also had 2 cocktails- I had sangria, and a cocktail with rosemary in it (can't remember the name) both were excellent and had special prices for HH.

There's something for everyone at this brunch - lighter fare, eggs and BBQ. I really appreciate how they make smaller portions and keep the food coming out freshly prepared. Here are a few of my favorites: On my first visit, the salmon and the brussel sprouts salad was the sure-fire winner. That salmon was butter-soft and lightly smoky. And that brussel sprouts salad is amazing: a combination of roasted & shaved brussel sprouts tossed with romaine lettuce. I can't stop eating it, it's so addictive. I also tried the roasted pork stuffed with pancetta and, well, a taste of pretty much everything. Our waiter insisted we place an order for biscuits and they are delivered to the table fresh and hot. They are the bomb. On my second visit, the stand out for me was by far the smoked turkey breast. Maybe it was because I took a slightly-thicker cut of the meat which kept it moister. (Note to chef, I wouldn't pre-slice those paper-thin slices of turkey - they just curl up and get dry). And, once again, that brussel sprouts salad won me over! My friends raved about the green chile pork stew, but it wasn't doing it for me that day.  For brunch, with $4 Mimosas or $5 Bloodies, with the range of amazing food and a casual \"take your time and enjoy your meal\" vibe, you cannot beat the Salty Sow. My \"go to\" place for special occasions.",

I was a little underwhelmed at a few things. The duck fries were delicious but I didn't care for the sauce. My husband liked it though. The goat cheese fritters were really good but the toast was a little bit TOO toasted. They're also HUGE and I prefer fritters smaller.   I ordered the Brussels sprouts Caesar. It was great. I really loved the flavor. It had a bit of bite to it. Would love to go back and try something new. But as for what I had this first time I wouldn't be dying to go back. I rated it so highly because it takes reservations which is so rare nowadays for moderately priced places.",

The pineapple was fresh and plenty of crispy caramelized cake with some nice vanilla ice cream.   The prices are really good for as good a product as they put out. A+++ great drinks too. Had the margarita with Chambord and it was so good and so refreshing.  Great place for adults probably not great for little kids but the food and drink are tops.",

Love the fried avocado with pulled BBQ pork and spicy fresca drizzled over the top. Smoked salmon toasts have a charred twist and pickled extras.  Their crispy chicken is perfect every time and their smashed roasted fingerlings are beautifully soft and crisp with bone marrow gravy smothering them to death.  Get excited for the giant pot that arrives to your table for the short rib entree. This dish is served cowboy style in a giant pot, with all of the cookout fixings... Carrots, potatoes and onion with the fried egg perched on top!  Whatever you do... Don't say no to dessert!    The cocktails are trendy, manly and refreshing... All of the local brews you love and some new ones that the bartenders can passionately introduce to you !  The Sow also has a free membership card to rack up the points and ensure your loyalty!",

A lot of the menu items I would never think to order but everything my friends and I tried was really good (including the fried green tomatoes & guacamole!) Great that they use a lot of local ingredients and feature local beers.   Good selection of items on the dinner menu. I was a big fan of the PV Salad - chicken, arugula, kale, spinach, dates, avocado, blue cheese, candied almonds, bacon, and a hard-boiled egg.   Really nice inviting atmosphere and decor.

Both were insane!  Of course we did the fries which were decadent as can be and split a caramel custard for dessert.  Everything exceeded our expectations.  We'd tried going here once before but it was too crowded.  We like to sit at the bar and you can catch them at a time when there isn't room but that's obviously the sign of a great place.  Wonderful open concept kitchen where you can see them cooking everything and the deck has heaters and a WONDERFUL fireplace.    Love this place.  You will too.",

We were worried that that we might get turned away, or that service would not be good, as often times restaurants start the cleanup process early. But we were pleasantly surprised at how accommodating they were, and the good service. I had to be shoulder, and my ride had the pork. The beef shoulder was served and a skillet-like dish. The beef was set a time a helping of mashed potatoes with gravy. This created a stew like effect, which was very tasty.  we also had their version of a Moscow Mule, and a dark beer. All in all, it was a great experience.",

I had the slow roasted pork as the main and it was a little on the cool side. Tender but overly salty. It was a challenge choosing something on the menu. I will go back for cocktails and the entertainment was great. But overall not my place for food. But do try for yourself.",

The cuisine is a great blend of comfort food, upscale items, and fresh/local ingredients. We have been coming here a few times a month since it opened and have yet to be disappointed!  They have a great $5 happy hour everyday from 4-6:30 pm with items like fried honey rosemary chicken with a sweet potato biscuit, crispy brussel sprout hash, green chili pork stew, and duck fat fries...yes!  They have a unique selection of cocktails and have $2 off HH specials on those too.   A favorite salad of mine is the PV salad with kale, grilled chicken, dates, avocado, bleu cheese, bacon and candied almonds.  Salty Sow has a great vibe with brick walls, unique lighting and a large rectangular bar. They have live music certain nights on their outdoor patio that we are still able to enjoy when it's 100 degrees outside :)  If you go on a weekend night, I suggest you get a reservation! Even the bar is packed most nights and the high tables around the bar are often reserved.   This place is a great gem in the PV mall neighborhood and I hope it stays that way!",

Now for our entrees, I ordered the rare roast beef French dip and my friend ordered their crispy chicken thighs. My rare roast beef was truly amazing and the meat was so juicy, tender and full of flavors! However, the mash potatoes that came as a side dish wasn't anything special. I took a bite from my friend's plate and felt that his dish was way too salty.   Dessert: We ordered a chocolate mousse with berries and some lemon bar with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I wasn't a big fan of their chocolate mousse dessert because it tasted very thick and rich. On this plate, it had strawberries, blueberries and some berry jelly smear. The jelly smear had a bitter taste to it and didn't go too well with the chocolate mousse. On the other hand, the lemon bar was edible I shall say. It was very tart and went well with the ice cream. The taste was similar to a key lime pie but obviously made with lemons.   Overall, the food was good and the place is very nice. It was nice listening to the live band playing on their patio. Service was okay just because our waiter seemed impatient and was in a rush. He was very short with his answers when we asked him questions and toward the end of the night, he asked us to hurry up and pay the tab because he was cut. Such a nice way to end a good night, NOT.",

That being said, since its upscale, beware it is pricey for sure. It can cost around $100 for 2 ppl b/c portions are small. The items I had were either hit or miss, but boy were the hits good. They try to order locally which is good and everything seemed really fresh. I had 4 peaks peach ale (which is delicious) and a pomegranite mixer drink that was also very refreshing and  tasty. We got their french fries which had eggs on top-good, but the tarragon dipping sauce was bad (like pine needles). I also had the braised pork with mashed potatoes -simply delicious with perfectly tender cooked meat. The salmon was also perfectly cooked with a nice crust on top, but I wasn't crazy about the sauce it came with -blah and fatty tasting. The desert (fried cheesecake and ice cream) was delicious, but not as unique as the rest of the meal I've had it at other places for less and just as good.",

    "text": "Like Crystal says \"Just go to happy hour\" Thats because the $ per ounce of food here is astronomical.  Beef shoulder is tasty($16), pretty small though. They serve it in a cooking pan with the veggies and taters, which are also 'lil nibbles.  Got the deviled eggs, good stuff. So good that I ordered another round after I mowed down the entree like it was an appetizer.($6+$6=$12)  My lady got the petite bone-in filets, which were tasty.($14? I think) She was going to get the pork shoulder but it had white beans in the sauce and they wont leave them out. Kinda weird, but whatevs.  Might go back for happy hour....",

We were going to be a party of 6-8 with my elderly parents and I figured it would be better to have reservations since I had family from out of town and I knew they had limited seating for handi-capped since I have been to the Resturant twice and liked the food. We're told they did take reservations when we got there way before the rush but they could not accommodate us since all the seating that was available was high tops obviously not good for elderly people to jump on to. They were not curtious about it at all. Maybe the staff should be better informed and also learn better manners.",

Refills for drinks are impossible and when they deliver the food it is impossible to ask for a condiment because the server just disappears. Once they up-sale cocktails and appetizers, the friendly service is gone. The last 3 times we could not get out in under 2 1/2 hours and never got a refill for the non-alcoholic drinks and waited over half hour for the check. We finally had to trap a different server to PLEASE find our server to get our check. Frustrating. I've stopped going and when asked I have suggested another restaurant where my business is valued. I feel that 5 visits is enough.  By the way I always tip over 20%, was a server, and genuinely never complain about service unless it's warranted. Service has to be good start to finish, not up until the order is taken.",

I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits, and the chicken was not completely cooked.  Additionally, the roast beef sandwich was not as rare as I remember it being which was disappointing because that is one of the non-modifiable items.  That sandwich had so much more flavor when it was nice and rare.  The tacos on the lunch and happy hour menu are still the best for continuous quality.",

The ambiance is warm and lively, with a dynamic, feel-good vibe and good, live music on the weekends. The dishes are creative and tasty. And this isn't just trendy, creative, unhealthy fare... There is something for everyone. The happy hour is a good value. The clientele is upscale but not pretentious. The staff is friendly. The hostesses are absolute gems and as helpful as can be - especially in having to deal with high demand at peak times. The specialty drinks are creative. Several of the servers and bartenders are highly professional and helpful. Others... less so. I am stopping short of giving the Salty a 5 because, in our many times there, there have been some areas of improvement. These include the service not being as good as what we have come to expect, certain areas of the restaurant being too loud, too crowded or too hot, and the kitchen running out of signature dishes - sometimes even early on in the evening. Again, a few areas of improvement over our many visits. And mostly related to the high demand on this place. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Our waiter was apologetic and pretty awesome overall.  A touch too much butter on the fish but our waiter was quick to bring me lots of lemon to cut through that issue.  Overall, I really enjoyed this fun, hip pig adorned establishment.  Texas gal felt happy and right at home.  TVs for golf and games, live band.  The staff from entery to exit...great energy.  Look forward to many yummy dining experiences.  Oddly, as we left, it became an insane microburst that soaked us to the bone in 10 seconds...Salty Sow experience was so good all this gal could do was dry down with a golf towle, wipe away the mascara, forget I was dry clean only and laugh my Salty Sow hiney off.  High to the Hog recommend for great food, fab staff and an overall great time.  Only thing that could have made it better?  Complimentary umbrellas!  It WAS raining pigs y'all!!!!  :)  YUM!!!!",

    "text": "This restaurant impressed me so much for dinner that I came for happy hour a week later. On our first visit, our server, Mason was great - extremely friendly and attentive!   The restaurant was busy and had so much energy! My fubby and I ordered white sangrias and it was amazing! I highly recommend especially since drinking half the glass, I was already feeling the alcohol! I loved their Brussels sprouts and lamb burger! They were so delicious! We also ordered the duck fries - the lamb burger included fries so I regretted ordering the duck fries because we couldn't even devour half of the fries! It was truly a waste. The duck fries were good, but I wouldn't order them again. Even though they were \"duck\" fries, they were just fries to me with an egg on top - big whoop. The bill came close to $50 which isn't cheap but I noticed they have happy hour so I knew I would be back!  A week later, we couldn't stop thinking about Salty Sow. Very little do we go to a new place and we like it enough to add to our restaurant list. Congrats Salty, you made it to our list!   We decided to try their happy hour and only ordered happy hour items - it was a big mistake but at least the next time, I know better. We didn't order the lamb burger because it wasn't on the hh menu. Instead, we ordered the Brussels, carnitas taco, fried chicken, chorizo stuffed mushrooms, the eggplant fritters, the catfish taco, and I got a Sedona Sunset drink.   My drink was way too strong that I only managed to get in a few sips. The tacos were $5 each - I mean one big taco for $5 and this is a happy hour price! They were ok but I wouldn't order these again - not for that price. The chorizo stuffed mushrooms again were flavorful but I wasn't a big fan. The fried chicken was good but wouldn't come back just for their fried chicken. And the eggplant fritters was just that - fried eggplant. Our server, Kayla, wasn't that attentive either. She took forever to check on us and give us our check and I don't think the restaurant was more busy than the last time we were there. The check totaled $50.  My lesson: come back and order the Brussels and lamb burger - and a white sangria and if I come during happy hour, stick with that order and the check will be a few dollars cheaper because of the Brussels and sangria!",

However, in the bottom of the dish was a syrup-like liquid which was Very disappointing and not speaking to the more savory flavors of the dish.  I asked for the chicken pieces and biscuit to be removed and placed on a dry plate, however, both the corn and biscuit were impregnated with that syrupy liquid.  Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals however.  To order again, delete that pervasive liquid is get on the side to control the amount absorbed.",

    "text": "We found this on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We were seated right away at 5:30 on a Friday night. We had the truffled deviled eggs to start. They were wonderful without being loaded with weird ingredients like pickles or pimento. My husband had one of their summer specials, a cold soba noodle salad which he polished off. I had the beef shoulder.  It was very tender and served with Yukon mashed potatoes. We finished with the butterscotch budino and a creme brulee. Both were perfect. Two reasons this isn't a 5 Star review. The root veggies with the beef shoulder were sweet and didn't do much for me. The same with the fried egg on top. Also we waited quite a while for our appetizer and once we got it we had just started to dig in when our entrees were served. But we would go again and would love to have Kaitlin as our server. Overall very good time!",

Only my second time here, but from the first time I came here, I knew this would easily be my favorite place to eat. They have daily happy hour from 4pm to 630pm & we mostly ordered from this menu on this particular visit. Had their crispy brussels sprouts leaves.. holy crap! I cant say enough about this dish.. the absolute best, I wish I could have it everyday lol. I have to give a shout out to our server Holly cause she was so pleasant! Very friendly and attentive.

We tried the roast pork loin stuffed with chorizo sausage, honey rosemary fried chicken, hot smoked salmon, fresh fruit and berries, Brussels sprout Caesar salad, fried green tomatoes, roasted beets, and a mimosa for me. We also hit the dessert bar. Everything was good quality, freshly prepared, and very tasty. Our server, Zack took great care of us, and we had a fun conversation. All the employees seemed very friendly. $19.95 for all you can eat We will be back to try the lunch menu.",

Only downfall was that the happy hour was only in the bar area and there were no seats or tables in the bar area.   Great ambiance and a nice menu. The banana foster beignets were absolutely amazing.

    "text": "This place gives me mixed feelings. On the one hand, the food is extremely fresh and of good quality. But on the other hand, some items seemed over priced and bland. I think proper ordering is key at this restaurant. Unfortunately, I am only about 60/40 when it comes to ordering well. So on my visit, only one out four in my party ordered decently, and even they didn't rave about the food... Therefore, I am happy to have tried this restaurant and glad to have crossed it off my must try list... But will I return? Unlikely.  I will say, the service was strong, the food was fast, and the restaurant was clean. Like sterile clean. Which I loved! Had the food been a bit more tantalizing I may have given it 5 stars. Also, their bar poured us some weak cocktails, and that was a disappointment as they were not cheap. Oddly enough, they started getting stronger in the last round.   I had ordered a $16.00 French dip, which was a perfect mid-rare, yay!, But bland, tough, and a bit small for the price. This sandwiches was so tough in fact, that I could only eat half because I was too tired from chewing to eat there rest... The duck fat fries were neither crispy or soggy, or flavorful. May I recommend using beef tallow?!? The green chili nachos are a great thought but smallish and the only flavor comes from the jalapenos.   All in all, it was about and hour from closing when we arrived, so maybe we had slim pickings left of the ingredients, and maybe that is why the food was average.... Either way we spent $135.00 for 4 people for a simple Friday night meal with a few drinks, I think it should have been better.",

Which we were expecting to be a fresh tomato dish with bread and it was actually a dill cheese smothered on ciabatta with dates and honey drizzle. It wasn't the light dish we were looking for but it was DELICIOUS. We devoured it and it's probably my favorite dish of all time!

You want to keep it to yourself. Where do I start from the white sangria to the rosemary fried chicken and the choices of truffled deviled eggs and cracklin' duroc pork belly? I mean you come here so that you can fall off every single diet. Diets are ridiculously starving you of great food here.   My favorite time here is lunch, happy hour and dinner. Why not? Great atmosphere, great service, great menu choices. If I could sit here all day and dine, I probably would but then my friends may think I have been kidnapped. The restaurant is always busy because it's a great date spot, happy hour meetup and even a casual dinner with the neibs. And I hear they have a killer Sunday brunch that I am going to have to check off. If you are still hungry from the list I rattled off earlier, have some duck fat fries to tie you over or order my other fave combo of the brussels sprouts and lamb burger. Anyone can get fit for the new year eating that delishness. And somewhat without guilt. I won't be impressed with technology until I can download food from here. Since it is my neighborhood spot, you'll see me often so come say hi.",

The comfy seating, and spacing inside made it a very nice place to enjoy a meal after a looooong day at work. So a few things to try: 1. Truffled deviled eggs, I've had some good ones, but these were just AMAZING! 2. The pork carnitas with those flour tortillas...dont argue with me, just get it! 3. Bananas foster, enough said, need I say more??? A sweet, crispy banana filled end to a perfect dinner. Oh, and those pickled onions....Amazing. The end... Btw, we're going back this weekend.",

First off, the 4-6:30 happy is a good deal. The bar area was open an available.  The bartenders were nice and accommodating, and efficient.  They made good Old Fashioned and Sangria cocktails.  Starving from our travels, we had the duck fat fries off the happy hour menu.  They arrived 2 minutes after ordering, and were lukewarm from sitting under a heat lamp yet satisfying enough.  We got our reservation and were seated outside at a reserved table with no issue.  Our server was a nice guy, who did a nice job, and yea, nice, nice, nice. My wife enjoyed her ribeye steak tacos which were a delicious take on the traditional carne asada tacos with large chunks of meat.  My meal, the pork chop stack with sweet potato mash, asparagus, and chimichurri was an abomination of a dinner meal.  By the time it arrived, everything was running together and looked like a $8 Mexican restaurant lunch.  The sweet potato mash was more of a liquid puree, with a slight taste of sweet potato.  The 3 slices of pork chop were redeeming, but not enough to pull the meal from total disaster.  Before the meal, the waiter has explained how everything started out pig or pork based and they moved away from it, and from my view, they can cross this off the menu as well.  Beautiful restaurant however, with nice people.  But lord save the cooks.",

While the meat was tender, the sauce was extremely over-salted (yeah, I know the name of the place but...).  My son had the French dip and it simply wasn't very good.  The menu says 'rare' but this was basically raw.  The bun was greasy, the jus tasted like it came from a can and the horseradish sauce didn't go well with the french dip concept.    Again, perhaps this style of food is just not my taste.  I will say that the service was friendly and fast and the beer was pretty good.",

I will spend this weekend trying to recreate it at home! My family and I split the fried chicken tenders, the hot and spicy seasoned flavor with the jalapeno cheddar biscuit. My dad told me to include in my review that the biscuit is \"a damn good biscuit\", and it was!  I split the pork belly taco and the carnitas pork taco. The pork belly taco was sooo good! I could probably do without the carnitas pork taco - as having grits on my taco was a little weird for me.  Lastly we shared the crispy brussel sprout leaves, and that was by far one of my favorite things!!  This is a great spot for happy hour, and you don't have to spend a fortune either. Everything is so affordable!  My drink was $6, two tacos were $10, brussel sprouts another $6 - really not bad! I can't recommend the place enough! Our service was phenomenal and quick too!",

They have large comfy booths with ample seating. No wait time on Sunday for dinner.   Our waiter was absolutely wonderful. He had his hands full as he was servicing many tables but we received all the attention we needed.   We ordered few dishes from happy hour menu. The fried green tomatoes were delish! It came with guacamole and it was nice pairing. The duck fat fries came with running egg yolk and it was fun trying to get some yolk with the dip. The Brussel sprouts chips were nice too. It had faint sweetness to it which was nice.   Their prime rib was slightly on the tough side even though we ordered medium rare. It had nice flavor and was nice to eat with the horseradish sauce. Their fish tacos were slightly fishy but with squeeze of lemon took care of that quickly.   Overall, nice meal. Their pork-belly taco was slightly salty but I can see why people love it. I will be back to try their brunch. Enjoy!",

Then for desert the bartender recommend a fried banana. All in all, it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  As I write this I am the parking lot having come back for my second night in town. Tonight I had the Pork Filet. It was just as good as the meal last night.

    "text": "The husband and I went to Salty Sow for happy hour a couple days ago and it was overall very good. I had been to the Yelp elite event here earlier this year and liked it very much, unfortunately, this place is nowhere near where I live so I hadn't been back. Aaanyway, the specials for happy hour include 5$ apps and 2$ off wine and cocktails. I had the sangria (very good, somewhat sweet but not too sweet) and the drink with the ruby red deep eddy vodka.... I forgot what it was called, but it was herbacious and tasty. We split the fried chicken app with the biscuit... the biscuit was delicious, but the chicken was a little on the sweet side. It was good overall, but I don't know that I would order again. We also shared the budino, which was so good at the elite event. It was still very delicious, but tasted like it wasn't made that day... it was a little liquidy on the bottom and the whipped cream wasn't as soft as it normally is... pretty sure it had been made the day before or a couple days before that. As I said, it still tasted good. I would definitely come back if I were in the area, especially for happy hour.   PS - the one bummer of hh (and the whole menu, actually) is that the majority of their food come with an egg on it (which I love, but the husband is allergic to eggs so it limits his options, and I know that they would probably leave the egg off if requested, but it takes away some of the intended flavor/texture of the dish).  PPS - They have all day happy hour on Mon and tues... nice!",

Pork ragout with asiago polenta and basil was killer (scrumptious!) & the fried green tomatoes were good too. Wish I'd had the duck fries though. Our first night's service with Lauren (during a Thurs eve) was awesome & the live music (Ryan Sims) was fantastic; 2nd night back the bartender & our server weren't as attentive or stellar (maybe because it was a Sat night).

I'll open with the fact that I have absolutely nothing negative to say, so you don't have to wait to find out if there's a gripe in this review!  :)  The food is amazing!  We had the duck fries as an appetizer, and the three of us couldn't stop eating them.  Next I had the Green Chile Pork Stew (which as actually an appetizer, but it made a meal).  I loved it and the portion was so generous I brought some home.  My husband had the Slow Cooked Beef Shoulder.   We had this dish last time we were there and once again it was perfect and he cleaned the dish!  We got the Crisp Chicken Thighs for my son, and hands down that's the best chicken I've ever eaten in my life.  Obviously a five year old didn't finish it, and I'm looking forward to having it left over.  For dessert, we had the Banana's Foster, which was just delicious.  It was another very generous portion that we finished because we couldn't stop.  Our waiter's name was Sean and he made this (very infrequent) night out as great as I could have hoped.  His level of service was stellar.  He was friendly, funny, very helpful, and efficient.  I really felt like our experience was important to him.  I also encountered other staff who either brought out food or just checked on us, and their professionalism was just as impressive.  During our visit, a man and a woman who were obviously managers stopped by to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, and the lady manager even went out of her way to suggest I could have more tortillas to go with my stew, and brought them back to me herself.    Start to finish, this experience was excellent.  The food and portions were appropriate for the price we paid, and I left happy.  Highly recommended to ANYONE.    Thank you all for a great night with my family!",

She was obviously frazzled and made no attempt to hide it. Brought our drinks out promptly, we only waited about 15 minutes for our food. I ordered the double cheeseburger. It was juicy, but there was no sauce. It was all meat and bread, no hint of cheese or flavor. The duck fat fries were good. My friend had to ask for different fries & fish as hers were cold. They didn't give us any qualms about it and brought the hot food out shortly. Our server just was not friendly at all the entire time we were there. I understand the pressure & stress that comes with serving, but there also is being professional and not allowing your stress to affect your customer service. The service & food were both very mediocre for the price. Won't be returning here again.",

    "text": "I can't recommend the Salty Sow enough. We've eaten here 6 times now, and have had a great experience each time. The staff is amazing and the food is always on point.   The happy hour menu is great. Their chicken liver mousse is absolutely amazing, and their gnocchi is the best I've ever tasted. I have never had a dish that hasn't been seasoned and cooked to almost perfection.   As a former executive chef I highly enjoy watching the open kitchen. The chefs are quick and clean. And each dish they prepare is seasoned and plated with a high pride that I wish other restaurants would learn from.   You can't go wrong here. You will enjoy it every time. High end enough for a fancy date or business meeting. Yet, layer back enough for a group of friends to sit around and laugh for a few hours. The staff is nothing but cheerful and very personable.   Hands down my favorite place to relax and eat.",

My boyfriend got pork and he loved it as well!  The ambiance is great. Some live music in the back. Big open bar area. Lovely dining for a date night.  The waitress was wonderful as well!

    "text": "We came here for happy hour, right when they opened one weekday. My husband had been there before on the patio and could only talk about the duck fat fries with the egg on top and the chill atmosphere. I wanted sushi, but because I love him ever so much, I gave in.  So we sat at the bar and were greeted with a friendly duo of bartenders, who took care of our every query. I had a delicious Copper State mule that melted away my workday, as well as any thought of the sushi. Of course, we ordered their duck fat fries, which did not disappoint. Next came the honey rosemary fried chicken. SO delicious. I tend to forget how much I love fried chicken. Crispy and sweet with honey, plus that hint of rosemary.... it was amazing. The brussels sprouts were pretty good. Crispy, but I found myself picking around the raisins (we had leftovers of the brussels, which I ended up tossing into my scrambled eggs with havarti the next morning. SUPERB). With my love of eggs, it was necessary to have the truffled deviled eggs. This was the only downfall of the evening. Lots of truffle oil, the bits of bacon were soggy, and it tasted like there was no egg yolk at all in the deviled egg filling. It was missing the color and flavor that we were hoping for. Husband pretty much hated it, so we opted for another order of the fries, since he was feeling nervous about ordering the mousse appetizer (but that's the first thing I'm ordering the next time I'm in!).   I noticed most, if not all, the tables were high tops. And they have some long tables that would be great for large parties. I like being able to see into the kitchen while they make everyone's food and I think it's interesting how all the servers are kind of dressed like they're all wearing a chef's jacket. Is that just me? I kept thinking the  chef was personally checking on a couple tables before I caught on.   One of our amazing bartenders told us about the porchetta that is made every Sunday and it sounded like perfection with a side of fingerling potatoes. So we'll be back soon to chill on their lovely patio with another mule and to eat too much amazing food. Very very soon.",

There was no kids menu so my son ordered off the appetizer menu and was quite happy with his deviled eggs. I shared my truffle fries with him which everyone at the table loved. The food was good and I tried a few new things like marrow and blackened red fish. The cocktails were fantastic and highly recommended. My only complaint was the noise level, we spent a lot of time just staring at each other because the noise level was so high we could hear each other. Despite that I would still go back.",

Always friendly, knowledgeable and willing to go above and beyond to ensure the best possible dining experience.

    "text": "Ok. The best thing about this place was the uber-comfy booths and buttery leather seats.   For real.   I had been SO stoked about finally going and trying the things people on Yelp raved about - the duck fat fries, the truffled eggs - I was heartbroken as the reality of the mediocre, tiny pieces of food and indifferent service crashed upon me.  My boyfriend and I met after work yesterday and I arrived ahead of him. I ordered his iced tea from the guy who brought me my Rosemary's Piglet drink (Save yourself the 9 bucks, it was tasty at first but then the rosemary overtakes the drink and it's just bitter. Like I feel now, post meal.) and the guy forgot about it, so my BF came in ten minutes later and was already slightly annoyed because he had no tea. Then the guy suddenly remembered and I saw him tell our server and point to our table so SHE could get our tea. (The reason I had not asked her is because she was a sporadic visitor to the table...the servers were all gathered around at the kitchen/grill entrance socializing with their backs to all the tables. There were not that many people there at 5 PM on a Wednesday, so no excuse for late/poor service. Lots of servers, but also lots of apathy.)  Then she brought the iced tea, and we had to flag someone else down a few minutes later for sweetener. It was annoying. Just....bad service. unattentive as anything.  We ordered the truffled eggs and mushroom caps for an appetizer. My one star is for the caps. They were made with what was touted to be homemade chorizio and the chorizio was succulent and spicy, The mushrooms themselves were a little hard and small but the flavor of the chorizio stuffing redeemed them.  The truffled deviled eggs were TERRIBLE. Tasted nothing of truffle, they were mayonnaise-y and almost sweet. Yuck.  I then ventured on to the \"bacon and eggs\" which was porkbelly over \"Creamy, cheesy grits\". These were the first grits I ever had in a nice place that were actually GRITTY. Terrible. And the tiny strips of porkbelly were overcooked, dry, and just not good. The egg served with them I didn't even touch as the yolk was solid  and cold, not over easy and lovely.  My BF got the beef shoulder, which he did like, the 3 ounces that he got, anyway. I have to say, the portions are smaller here than you expect for the cost. And it wouldn't be so terrible if it all wasn't so BLAND.  The duck fat fries just tasted like re-heated, overly crispy then cold again french fries. Huge waste of time.  So we tried everything we wanted to, but in the end I feel like I paid $80 for a mediocre food and indifferent service.  Oh! One thing they are doing right there? The hostessing! And the hostesses! They did everything right - greeted us, told us they were glad we came when we left - they were awesome. And I have to say the manager walked around and asked if everything was ok - but at that point, I was hungry, annoyed, had to be somewhere after dinner and simply didn't feel like getting into it. If I thought they could have made it right, I would have said something. But the flaws are in the way the food was done, when it came down to it. It seems to be working for most people but then I wonder where these people giving Salty Sow four and five stars have been eating?????    Local Bistro or Wally's American Grill - those are places in this genre that are doing it right. This place is all hype, in my opinion.",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for a place for brunch. Celebrating our 27th anniversary, we looked at many of the most popular but most were booked. We found the Salty Sow as an option and decided it looked like a good option. Awesome! Too many great dishes to write about, but you can try them all since it's a buffet! When I saw the price online I was skeptical since it seemed too good to be True. It exceeded all expectations! I typically go for basics at brunch as I love eggs and omelets, but there were too many other choices that I wanted to try. If I wanted eggs they would have made them to order. The thing that put me over the top was their porchetta stuffed with chorizo. I will go back just for that! Our check was probably half of what you expect to pay for a quality brunch and we couldn't have enjoyed it any more. I asked about how they prepare the porchetta and the executive chef practically wrote down the recipe for me. The pride he takes in his work is obvious! We'll be back!",

Being foodies from Atlanta, we're very serious about good food (can't stand chains). We couldn't wait to give this place a shot and it did not disappoint! We ate nothing, but apps since we saw many awesome items there! We also tried tons of fun cocktails with a wide variety for all palates. We finished up with the richest caramel pudding which was AMAZING! Wish we had more time to go back and try even more of the menu.   Wish we had this place back in Atlanta. We'd be regulars for sure!",

    "text": "Went for dinner, first experience here.    Busy night but we were seated fairly soon at high-top table with a footrest bar, interesting but a little hard to keep my sandals on as my feet dangled or slipped on the bar!  Trendy decor, rather noisy, conversation was difficult, also the light over our table was out so it was quite dark, not so good to read the small printed menu.  A nice outdoor patio where a musician was playing, music piped inside too but sound system made a regular and rather annoying cracking noise.  They also have a number of very long high top tables that could accommodate a large group intimately or several groups of guests for community dining.      As for the food - we tried crispy chicken thighs and asigo-crusted halibut.  Both entrees were very flavorful with a pretty presentation.  3 pieces of chicken, each served on a smashed potato, some kind of sauce all around.  Yummy with leftovers to go home.  The halibut was seriously overcooked, not flaky but mushy.  I debated about sending it back but I was hungry and it tasted great so I didn't mention to our server.  If it had been properly (or even semi-properly) cooked, this entree would have been outstanding.  The flavor was delicious in spite of the overcooked state of the fish.  Served w/ broccolini.    Service was adequate but not inspiring.     I noted Happy Hour specials and some other interesting items on the menu.  I plan to go back and try the patio next time.",

    "text": "Oh, their first restaurant was in Austin, Texas? I'm listening.   Thorough execution is an understatement, this place is almost too on-point.  For this type of restaurant, the decor is, to my eye, literally perfect. I think it's a shame this pro-eatery isn't located in a more centralized area of the city.  Starting out, the Bacon and Gruyere Crusted Bone Marrow was [expletive] incredible. Intensely indulgent and rich but small enough so as to not weigh you down (this is important to my shallow appetite). Although The Duck Fat Fries [110-minute egg, cold bearnaise] sounded stupendous to my grumbling belly, I decided to save my appetite for the main course.   For an entre, I ordered the Pork Ragout. The soft polenta, basil oil, and parmesan were perfectly suited to each other and provided an excellent foundation for the rich tomato-y pork ragout. This isn't a huge dish, so I seriously considered licking my plate clean.   My girlfriend ordered the Slow Cooked Beef Shoulder, substituting the mashed potato base for white corn cheese grits. A much larger dish, we both worked on this. The beef was tender, moist, and flavorful, the vegetables were cooked to perfection, and the fried egg on top had me at \"fried egg on top\". Homey and comforting American scrumptiousness.   Cocktails: The Sparkling Sangria [elderflower liqueur, bubbles, lemon, orange, grapes, opal basil] was sweeter than I was expecting, but it was very refreshing and highly drinkable. The Zenjen [Bluecoat gin, Canton ginger liqueur, lavender syrup, lemon, rose bubbles] was fairly tasty, but leaned more toward the side of typical, although I must say it was a good stern mix. The drink prize of the night goes to the Curly Tail [Camarena tequila, cilantro, serrano, blood orange, smoked salted rim]. This was super delicious and unique, and also very strong. The ice cubes had jalapeno peppers frozen in, which was a wonderfully cool touch.   If you like American gastro-pub style dishes, pork things, and other delicious land animal meats, this place is a must go.",

It was interesting, maybe not something I would do again, as the goat cheese and chicken liver mousse seemed like an odd combo. Dinner, however, was wonderful! My guest had the pork shoulder, and I had the pork belly. The pork belly was perfectly rendered and crispy, with cheesy grits, delicious. My guest's pork shoulder was perfectly seasoned and tender, served in an abundant amount alongside chipotle spiced beans. Definitely will go back!",

The most flavourful carrots I've eaten in a long time, and the beef! Like buttah! I have yet to stop thinking about that beef. I would marry that sauce, too.

    "text": "Just got back from a Saturday night dinner at The Salty Sow.  First time.  What a great looking yet casual place it is.  Open kitchen layout, above the kitchen \"window\"  appears to be a chalkboard wall with drawings and the restaurants' name.  On the right side of the chalkboard is a drawing and next to is the word \"Merde\"--French for \"sh-t\". Who but me would notice that.  Too funny.   Firstly, we ordered the sangria which contained basil, orange and grapes.  Very nice drink.  Also a Chardonnay which was quite good.   We ordered one of the specials, Branzini (a fish)  that was served with fingerling potatoes and a salad.  I ordered a Roast beef sandwich with gruyere cheese on a brioche bun accompanied by fries fried in duck fat.  I figured those fries would be super-duper amazing. Duck fat? That's as close to Godliness as you can get.  When the food came hubby was quite impressed with the look of his plate. The bronzini, while quite thin and small, had a crispy skin and he said it tasted quite good.  The salad consisted of all types of greens including some roasted pepper strips and it looked well-dressed without being excessively oily.  I didn't get to taste it because it was not offered to me (if you know what I mean).  He also got 5 fingerling potatoes.  He totally enjoyed his meal and cleaned his plate.  In my head I was thinking that later on tonight, I would have to make him a little snack since he is used to having bigger portions---not piggy portions, just slightly bigger.    My roast beef sandwich looked amazing and when I took a bite of it I realized that this was high quality meat.  However, I was not blown away by the sandwich.  I didn't say wow.  I didn't say YUM.  I didn't say much.  I added a little salt, but the flavor profile did not improve.  It was just another sandwich. Then I dunked it in the AU JUS which accompanied it and.... well..... it's still Just OK.  I also noticed that the gruyere cheese did not have the usual sharpness expected of a good gruyere.  It would have provided a welcome contrast to the meat.  Then I decided to seek refuge in the FRIES.  Yes, I thought ...the duck fried fries... just like in Paris.    The first thing I noticed was that I had asked for them  to be extra crispy and they were blonde.  Blonder than my ex-husband's first wife.  I decided not to be biased against these blonde fries.  Wasn't it possible  that blonde fries could be delicious and scrumptious and irresistible????  I overcame my bias and tasted the fries that were fried in the almighty Duck Fat.  They were pretty good but not delicious, scrumptious or irresistible.  NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.  I generously asked hubby to taste them.  (Usually I would NOT be so generous).  He asked me,  \"Are these fresh ? They taste like frozen fries\".  Hmmmm.  Good point.  Could it be that these fries are merely fried in DUCK FAT for FLAVOR, but are not the real down home, peel the potatos, cut them and fry them version of french fries??  I wonder. Maybe I should have asked my server (who was very good by the way).  So in NO WAY, NO HOW do these fries even come close to the fries I get in Paris (especially at  AU BOUQUET Saint PAUL in Paris (in the 4th district for you guys heading to Paris).  When those Parisian \"frites\" arrive next to a steak with brandy peppercorn sauce what do you think I go for first?  I eat the fries first because life is uncertain.  I may have a heart attack when eating my steak and I will have missed out on the FRIES!!!!  My autopsy would say that I died not of a heart attack but of a \"broken heart\" because my stomach was deprived of those delectable fries.    All in all the Salty Sow is a nice place to dine with its attractive atmosphere,  eclectic menu and great service.  Hubby was happy this time, I was not.  But that's the way it goes.  Maybe next time I will order something different and will walk out with a smile.  Who knows?",

The beer selection isn't the greatest but still enough selections to please most palates.    I was a big fan of the roasted beet salad.  It had a delicious tangy vinaigrette that was amazing.  I would order that again every visit.    The lamb burger was good as well.  It was huge and had a good sauce as well.  I don't think I would reorder it as some other items on the menu looked much better.  I also tried the fried brussel sprouts and green chile stew.  Both were tasty.  The green chile stew could have had some more heat but the flavors were very good.  I am looking forward to coming back and trying out some other dishes.",

Really sorry to prejudge you like that, Salty Sow.  On a busy Friday night, they took my online reservation and even though the place was packed we only had to wait a couple of minutes for our table.  The server was as professional as any we've had in the Valley, which is saying a lot.  Sorry to tell you that I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the beer list looked good.  The wine list was very good and had wines by the glass for every budget and palate.  Drinks did take longer than I wanted.  I should have been more sympathetic that the bar was jammed for Friday Happy Hour, but it was a family gathering and, well, you know...I just needed that glass of wine now.  The menu is diverse with offerings from entree salads (really inventive ones, not the typical chicken ceasar) to burgers to chile verde to slow roasted meats and grilled meat/fish.  Everyone at the table loved everything they got.  The food was very well executed, was delivered in a reasonable time and our waiter and one other staff person checked in frequently to make sure all was well.  For the excellent food, drinks and service, the bill was roughly 20% less than an equivalent restaurant would charge.  Shame on me for taking so long to eat here.  One should be aware that the Salty Sow is very noisy, which didn't bother us at all, but really it is probably the noisiest restaurant around.  Not the place for a quiet meal, but it is perfect if you want lively atmosphere.  We all agreed we love the Salty Sow and will be back soon!",

Amazing selection of both wines and beers, the deviled eggs are wonderful, and top it all of with the butterscotch budino. Delicious!

We had stuffed figs with prosciutto for our appetizer from the specials menu. The taste was amazing! My husband had the French dip which was cooked to perfection while I had the lamb burger which was also amazing! The staff and service was top notch and the ambiance is young and vibrant with live music on the weekends. We can't wait to go back!",

What really topped it off was the poached egg on top.  I'm a total whore for an egg on anything.  Brussels sprouts were darn good and so were the potato-bacon-tot things.  Solid old-fashioneds and nice pours all around.  Open kitchen like I love and the food coming out looked spot on.  Five stars for now. Will review again after I have a meal.

We invited another couple with us to celebrate their anniversary, they enjoyed it as well (their first time).  The food is great, service is on their game, waiter and bussing staff, and the wine selection is very good. Also, the red wine is kept at the right temperature (about 60 degrees); Too often restaurants don't pay attention to this detail. The atmosphere is inviting, boisterous but not too loud. Though this boarders on fine/eclectic dinning, it is very casual. The outdoor seating is also great!",

Wanted to have the bone in filet medallions but they were out on a Tuesday so back to the RW menu.  Caesar salads were DELICIOUS.  Decided on the Bacon Butter Stacked Pork Chop but in reality it was center cut pork LOIN.  Big difference in flavor profile but still very delicious.  Wife had the salmon and she left none so it was very DELICIOUS also and the desserts were EXCELLENT.  Service was very inattentive but rectified by Jenna the bartender/manager.  Definitely going back but with expectations of better service or I could just sit at the bar with Jenna.",

We tried all of the tacos on the menu, all delicious, I was a little afraid I wouldn't care much for the fried egg on top but it just added to the flavors and I'm a fan. The crispy fried chicken in rosemary and honey is a meal in itself and delicious.It comes with a biscuit and that would be my only complaint the biscuit was dry, not flaky. The white sangria was addictive it was so good! We finished off the meal with the apple pie which was an actual small pie, so definitely made for sharing and can  be shared with 3 or 4 people, it comes with a huge scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream which easily stands on its own due to it's rich and creamy texture.",

Nothing special, no dishes that stood out.  Simple foods that could have gotten anywhere. We expected a lil better for the price.  No brunch drinks included for the price as you can get at Sumomaya or Buck& Rider.   I did order  the Bloody Mary which you can make your own. I was looking forward to making one. Lots of different spices and what not for flavoring. However, the glass with the vodka & ice, that the waitress served, was very dirty.  When I went up to make my drink, I showed the glass to the bar tender, asked for new glass as this had sticky residue all through the glass. She looked and stated, Oh it's lemon residue-that's all. I said yes, but I didn't have lemonade, so can I have a new glass. She finally said yes, but then said lol- Do you want new ice and vodka  as she's pouring this which was in dirty glass to the now clean glass.   I was so irritated,that I just wanted to get away from her, I said sure whatever you think. So she went on to pour it  from dirty to clean. Mind you, I passed on that Bloody Mary.  Ugh! Phone at the hostess desk was ringing with no one to answer, so one of the girls cutting up pastries answered the phone while wearing her gloves ( that's not a problem) however, she went back to cutting pastries with the same gloves.  Must have been an off day for cleanliness.  Don't think I'll be!",

Tonight everything was top notch - shrimp/avocado appetizer, club sandwich (one of the best I've ever tasted, ever) and a Caesar salad as the side...but here is where I need to stop. The Caesar salad components where excellent  - but the dressing was SO garlicky that it stopped me in my tracks. I asked my husband to try it, and he adores garlic, even raw garlic dipped in chocolate - but even he said that this was way over the top. I alerted our waitress, and she said she would pass on the comment, as the chef had already left for the day, but she was sure it was a one-off anomaly. However - after eating a few more bites of the salad I had another glass of excellent Rose, and then their outstanding berry cobbler, and even after drinking water non-stop after being home for more than one hour as well as rinsing my mouth out with mouthwash - all I can taste is garlic. Yuck. My next move is Apple Cider Vinegar. If that doesn't clear the taste, then I welcome your input. Thanks.",

    "text": "We moved to the neighborhood and Salty Sow is my new guilty pleasure.  Their menu has a lot of fun yet wholesome items that I can't get enough of.  Both myself and The Boy were surprised by their brussel sprout Caesar salad.  The dressing has the right amount of bite and the crispy brussel sprout leaves give it a nice bump in flavor.  Speaking of the crispy brussel sprout leaves, if you are a brussel fan, these are a must get. I was also super impressed by their smashed Yukon gold potatoes.  Even though I HATE the phrase \"smashed potatoes\", I can overlooked it at Salty Sow because these smashed babies are delicious.  The Boy had their Hot Chicken sandwich and was pleased. The sandwich came out and it was HUGE!  I had their prime rib special which on Sundays is half price. It comes with a side salad and the smashed Yukon golds and even at full price is a great deal.  The pork belly and cheese grits is a must try if you are a bacon fan.  I am not a fan of their happy hour food.  The pork belly taco and fried chicken are just meh. Dat biscuit tho, with the fried chicken, needs to be added to the menu because it is bomb!  Service in the dining room has been awesome but at the bar it's so so. The male bartender is not very attentive unless you are a regular.  The ambiance is awesome, the patio is spacious and I can't wait to try the seats by the kitchen.  The kitchen staff has a fun dynamic (from what we could see from the dining room) and it would be fun to have a front row seat.  Their music selection is an awesome mix of songs that has never constantly remarking, wow, this is SUCH a good song!",

We were immediately greeted and served at our table which is always a positive for me. Our drinks quickly came and our server was very quick and efficient. I'm so glad I ordered the bone in filet (or whatever it was called) because it was so good. Last time I was here I don't remember all the beef options but wow, they stepped up their game if it's a new menu. My friend got the special which was a steak panini and wow, hers was so good too!!  I left so happy here. Our server took great care of us. He made sure our drinks weren't empty and we were happy. I can't stand when servers either don't come by enough or come too much, but our server was perfect. I will definitely be back soon! For the quality the price is very good as well! I would expect for this quality I'd pay at least 30% more. I'm so happy I made the decision Saturday night to come.",

Atmosphere was great, lots of people having fun, which means it was also loud inside so it was hard to hear the full conversation at our table.    Food was great!  But it was TOO much food with some of the dishes.  Portion control needs to be addressed by management.  (If you have the crispy chicken dinner, the portion is enough for two people).  So much food was wasted ... couldn't take home as we are just passing thru on vacation.   If we are ever in the area again, we would stop by again.",

    "text": "Was in town for a family issue, and three of us decided to try this on Friday during happy hour based on location, yelp reviews, and menu. Solid 4.5 stars. Noisy, but nice Friday happy hour vibe.  Sat at a raised booth with a foot bar going the length of the banquette on both sides of the table.  As I found out when we left, the foot bar can be treacherous if your foot slips off before you completely leave the booth, because there's a cross bar at each end of the table that the footbars are attached to. My lower shin got a good whack from the crossbar, and I almost face planted, because I lost my balance when I tripped on the crossbar. So, careful with that one. We shared the truffled deviled eggs, which were smooth and creamy, with a richness that I'll attribute to a hint of truffle oil. For mains we had blackened salmon with black eyed pea salad, ceviche with chips, and the roasted Duroc pork belly with cheese grits and arugula/apple/in-house bacon salad. The pork belly was really delicious, a well-seasoned meaty chunk of pork belly with a crisp exterior. It was a delight of textures and flavor. Cheese grits and arugula salad were terrific accompaniments.  I'd had grits for breakfast earlier in the day, and they were unfortunately noticeably dry.  No problem with that at Salty Sow; they were creamy and cheesy.  The bacon chunks (which were all meat, no fat) in the arugula salad were just a tad salty for me, and I didn't finish them.  Heard no complaints about the salmon or the ceviche.  All in all, a really good experience which would be worth exploring again on a future trip.",

The reason our meal was late was that the kitchen forgot our order and the waitress didn't check on why it took 45 minutes to make two salads. The waitress apologized, but the manager don't even bother to talk with us.  I'm certain we will not go back. The appetizers we had weren't that great either.",

There are an assortment of things I normally would not try but somehow the folks at Salty Sow know how to make them taste just right. Last night I had their porchetta sandwich which was a special for that evening. The sandwich was huge, in fact I could only eat half, which meant the other half went with my very happy fiance to work today for lunch. It might have been big but it was really, really tasty. We also shared the brussel sprout leaves as an appetizer. You heard right. Leaves. There are pieces of brussel sprouts and some brussel sprouts leaves all baked and crispy with an incredibly sweet sauce smothered on top of them. If you go there -- you have to try them. I'm not usually a huge brussel sprouts fan but these are incredible. For those with adventurous appetites, this is your spot! They also had fun cocktails on their menu. Definitely worth a visit.",

How can they be out of that! Appetizers were on the small side.  Deviled eggs were just mediocre flavor and only 4 of them And chorizo stuffed mushrooms were real small and only 6 of those. Entrees took an hour more.The manager came over and apologized after We complained to our poor server But the manager just said \" it's out of my control. The chef does whatever he wants\" I think You need to find a new manager. That is not an acceptable response. We were just done with this place when the entrees finally arrived. Don't know if it was good or average, won't go back. Server tried hard.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE!!!!  My boyfriend and I went here on a Wednesday evening for dinner and we were STARVING, we hadn't eaten since breakfast. The parking lot made it seem like they were packed but there was plenty of open seating when we walked in and we were seated promptly. We ordered a blood orange margarita topped with cider from the board menu for dinner my BF ordered the double Cheese burger and I ordered the hanger steak medium rare, it came with green onion mashed potatoes and zucchini. It took a little while to get our dinner but it wasn't too bad. When dinner arrived I first tried one of my BFs duck fat fries and mentioned it was cold, he said he got a hot one and was happy with it. I then tried a piece of steak, again it was cold, tried some potatoes and they were cold. They were so bad they had that \"shell\", if you will, that mashed potatoes get when they have been sitting too long. We grabbed our waitress and I told her my food was cold, she said \"oh...\" Grabbed my plate and walked away, no apology, no sincerity, no nothing. My BF was done with his burger by the time my re-fire came out, it was delivered by the manager who dropped the plate off and said that the plate was hot and to be careful, she walked away, again no apologies....  Well this time the food was hot but the steak was over cooked. We called over the manager and told her it was over cooked, it was almost like we had to convince her it wasn't cooked right, she just gave us these looks making us feel like idiots. She asked if it was hot this time and I said yes, she's like well at least we got half of it right this time. Walked away with my plate and there I waited yet again for my food.  She brought over my plate, third times a charm right?  WRONG!!!  The food was cold AGAIN!!!  The manager actually had the nerve to say that ordering a medium rare steak would result in a colder piece of meat...  My jaw almost dropped, I said I realize it's not going to be blazing hot but this isn't my first steak. I can order rare prime rib hotter than this steak, NOT to mention the potatoes were cold again and I tasted them hot on the 2nd plate they brought out. The manager asked if they could bring me something else, at this point I was so fed up I just said no, I don't want anything. She's like \"I don't want you to leave hungry\" we had been here over an hour and I wasn't going to wait any longer for a restaurant who obviously can't cook a steak or serve hot items. I just wanted to leave. She came back around and said she felt embarrassed and didn't know what was going on and said our meal (i.e. My BFs meal) was compensated and gave her card and said if we'd give them another chance to let her know next time we come. Well there won't be a next time. IMO if a the plate wasn't right the first time the manager should make damn sure its perfect the 2nd time, there should never EVER be a third or fourth time. ABSOLUTELY WORSE RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!",

We tried to hit this place up once before but it's a dinner only grub hub.  We brought the baby with us as we believe he is amazing and acts very well behaved. Most children prob should stay away. The food is a foodies paradise. We started with one of the better charcuterie boards that we've tried in a long time. It was loaded with some common goodies and a solid mix of items we had never heard of or even thought up. Loved it all. This place has a really cool environment with live music and fun knowledgable servers. We pigged out on a plethora of porky dishes and left stuffed. There's not much I can think of that I'd do different. I'll blame the perfectly mixed martini for that. If you're a valley native what are you waiting for?",

They had an unusual menu but I am pretty adventurous. We tried basically everything on the Happy Hour menu. I have to say the Rosemary Honey Chicken was by far my favorite!! I'm a country girl and fried chicken is my weakness!!! The duck fat fries were crispy and full of flavor and I loved the 110 minute egg on top. We also tried their meat and cheese tray( I can't remember the name exactly). I really enjoyed the goat and cow cheese blend, I even tasted some of the chicken liver pate and it was pretty good.    All in all we had a great time and they gave us a huge table to ourselves (7 people). They even have live music on Thursday nights which is a huge plus in my book!!! I will definitely be back in the future!",

The whole chain doesn't carry Bud products or similiar, they just use local beers. The beers start at 5 bucks post happy hour. It was mostly empty at the bar on Sunday night and the bartender from Sweden looked bored. The rest of the joint had birthday parties and was crowded. The TV's are placed way too far from the bar area and don't bother going here to watch games, you will need a telescope to see the TV's from the bar. I get it, not every place is made for the everyday guy, so fair enough, so everyday guys be warned.",

But with the constant overcrowding around the table, by staff, and the horribly mixed classic 70s rock (which did not go with the atmosphere) it felt short of anything you'd expect to be decent.  The food overall was not what you'd want it to be. It's a farmhouse restaurant that just seems like it's trying to upstage itself.  The duck fries are NOT that great, and not worth the price. I had a fish platter and it was overly seasoned, had a ton of unnecessary asiago cheese on it and the veggies were overcooked.   Everything else just fell flat.  Don't let the reviews hype this place. Honestly, it's not worth the money nor the time.",

Staff was friendly and helpful, food was great, loved the live music.  Fast forward to today when no seating was available outside so we asked to be moved when a table became available ... the request was ignored the entire time as I watched multiple tables outside be vacated and filled.  The service was bad.  I have never had to wait so long for food or drink there.  Our second drink came after we were done eating, I considered returning it since I ordered it 25 minutes before and food was prepared before a drink was.  Waited another 15 minutes for our check.  No live music outside, staff was not accommodating, and hostesses ignored our request.  All I can think of for this drastic change is new, worse management.  Therefore, we will not be back.  Major disappointment to see one of our favorite spots go downhill.",

But I was very disappointed when we left. We ordered the charcuterie board which was just gross. Even the prosciutto didn't taste quite right and its like, how can you screw that up? This dish was the start of my queasy stomach. I had asked for another piece of toast as we still had cheese and meat left and was told we would have to pay for it! One piece of toast!  Next, we had ordered the Candied Pork Belly which literally made me sick to my stomach! I still feel queasy after eating here 3 hours ago! The pork belly is mostly all FAT and greas. The balsamic sauce it is drowning in is heinous and I'm not sure who's idea it was to mix the two. It comes with a small amount of collard greens soaked in the sauce which is a really cheap filler to this dish. Yuck!  I was hiding my distaste from the waitstaff because I didn't want to come across as rude to her but we wont be back. In fact we were never even asked how we liked our meal. There are just too many great Phoenix restaurants to waste fifty bucks on lunch at this place. Very pretentious for a Wal-Mart parking lot.

Even despite that, the food was lousy and dry, the French toast tasted like sponge soaked in banana, and all of the baked goods were obviously frozen not fresh. I appreciate the customer service- especially the manager who refunded our meal when we pointed out the flies, but I will not be returning.",

I've tried many of the items: duck fries, Brussel sprouts, the beef tips, the pork even the mousse, stuff made out of something I'd rather not know, was incredible.   The specialty drinks are also well thought out and not the same old Manhattan or house margarita.. There are options, using the good stuff!! That's what we love about this place!   The food is satisfying the drinks are original the ambiance is energetic and mature. You can dress up or be casual you'll fit in just fine:) I highly recommend this place. We've been there at least a dozen times and have never been disappointed. IMO the bar top is the best seat in the house.",

    "text": "I don't want to \"boar\" you with a lengthy review, but I can't help but feel the need to sing the praises of this fine gastropub!  If there's such thing as Hog Heaven, we found it here.  We were fortunate enough to be right next to Salty Sow when we decided 1) we were ready for dinner, and 2) we didn't have any particular food or restaurant we were craving at the time.  I remembered driving past it before, and that it was a place I had been wanting to try. Go me!  We went inside and were greeted and seated promptly by the hostess.  Hungry AND no wait? Win!  The deco is modern with a farm/barn feel.  Lots of wood finishes, open layout, large centrally-located bar, and of course, the obligatory pig (and rooster) paintings on the wall.  So far, so good.  We sat down and were greeted by our servers (one vet, one newbie).  Guess what?  It was happy hour, and we were provided with the appropriate menu.  The beautiful thing about their happy hour is that you can get a number of things for $5 each (their \"bites\" and \"small plates\").  Did I mention the full bar? Yep--$2 off wells and their \"Signature Sips.\"  Bring me the rum, savvy?  We started off with the truffle deviled eggs appetizer ($5).  How do you make deviled eggs better, you ask?  Well, my friend, let me enlighten you.  You make them with a touch of truffle and top them with bacon bits.  I felt like I was bi-winning by that point.   Next up, duck fat fries.  Duck.  Fat.  Fries.  From this day forward, I will evermore be disappointed with every french fry I eat that isn't a duck fat french fry.  Damn you, Salty Sow! You've ruined me!  They are fried in duck fat (Captain Obvious to the rescue), then topped with a 110-minute egg and served with hollandaise sauce for dipping (think Benedict style).  I'm fairly certain that by the time I got to the end, I had my nose in the plate and was \"rooting\" around for hidden morsels.  Next came the main course, a trio of items we chose from the $5 selection to share.  My wife picked the Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken (with Cat Head Sweet Potato biscuit), and I chose the Spit-Roasted Pork Taco (with sweet onion slaw, pickled onions, smoked tomato salsa, and cilantro aioli) and the Beef Shoulder Taco (with fried egg, arugula, and feta).  Now, I preface this by saying I don't call myself the \"Taco Destroyer\" for nothing.  Ask my wife and friends...I have an unhealthy obsession with tacos.  These tacos were delicious.  I ate half of each and (begrudgingly) gave the rest to my wife.  OMG thank the gods I did.  I've had chicken and biscuits.  I've had chicken and waffles.  I've never had this.  My mouth waters and my stomach grumbles just thinking of that blend of salty and sweet, soft biscuit and crunchy breading, juicy chicken..............................................Sorry! Drifted off there for a second fantasizing about it.  I can neither confirm nor deny if I squealed while eating it.  Is there such thing as tri-winning?  Did I mention it was only $5 for happy hour...and enough to share????  Next stop, dessert.  I have to admit, there was a problem with dessert--that problem being we couldn't decide between the bananas foster (think bananas foster, dipped and deep fried in a monte cristo like breading, topped with powdered sugar, and served with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream) and chocolate cake dessert (topped with whipped cream, raspberry sauce, and strawberries).  How to solve the problem? Order both, naturally.  Hey, if you're gonna go, go all out.  Sound delicious?  Multiply it by 10.  Then you might be getting close.  Maybe.    Needless to say, we pigged out, thanked and tipped our waiters, and waddled to the car.  Pig puns aside, I only have one regret about the Salty Sow--we lived in Phoenix for an entire year before finding it.  My heart weeps to think of all those times I \"settled\" for a 4- or 5-star reviewed restaurant when I could have been dining here instead.",

The rosemary honey dipped fried chicken.. so sweet and savory, a perfect umami combination. Right now I'm craving it so badly.

    "text": "Haven't seen your friend in a while? I know a great place to catch up.  The Salty Sow.  Close your eyes and point at the menu.  That's how you find something delicious at the Salty Sow.  Unless you are notoriously particular, you can't miss.  Your greatest regret will be when you taste the food of someone else in your party and it's not your own.  However, your solace lies on your own plate!   Service is consistently good, and servers are skilled at pacing the meal, which, from my experience, isn't common among Valley restaurants.  If you're inclined to eat as much, I highly recommend the Chicken Liver Mousse.  The Asiago-Crusted Halibut is a menu staple, and with good reason.  Pair these with appropriate wines or  Salty Sow's signature cocktails, and a bad day gets good and a good day gets better.  Despite the above, I can't give five starts due to service when seated at the bar.  It's decent at best and slightly frustrating at worst.  In fact, in one instance, my 41 year old, salt & pepper-haired better half had a bartender almost make an incident over carding him.  In fairness, a superior (and the other bartender) quickly apologized on his behalf.",

But me absolute Davonte is their warm salmon. This is a fabulous spin on traditional smoked salmon (aka lox) on many brunch buffets. Can't wait for more. And, on top of it all, they have a well stocked make your own Bloody Mary bar at $5 a glass. Have been 4 times and plan to keep returning",

They have a gluten-free menu and many great options for those following the Paleo diet.

We all 3 really enjoyed our dinner here tonight. Only complaint was it's a little pricey. I'm not taking any stars off for that. You get what you pay for, and we got a real nice experience tonight.",

Great drink selection. And despite not being a kid friendly place. My son does really well there. They have a grilled cheese sandwich that he loves. It's not on the menu but if you ask them you shall receive. Dessert is a MUST. You can't go wrong here. They also have live music which is great.",

A couple was seated next to us about 5 minutes later, ordered and received their drinks.  Low and behold we had the same waiter, who then came to our table.  We received our water about 5 minutes after that.  It took about 20 plus minutes before we were able to have our order taken only to find out that they don't cook most meats they way you want but only the way the menu states.  We ordered two appetizers, ate, and waited another 10 minutes to get our check.  Not worth a revisit.  They don't make food the way you want but how they want.  If you like that along with a very long wait, this place might be for you, but it's not for me.",

I went with the price fixed menu and enjoyed the Brussels sprouts salad as well as a very tasty and large portion of the pork belly. Outstanding! I had to try the already famous duck fat fries with the 110 minute egg and wasn't disappointed. The egg was an experience and clearly this is a dish not to be missed; especially if you like French fries. A nice dessert selection including a fresh fruit plate rounded off a very pleasant experience. Considering the PV mall location, The Salty Sow is a great find and I'll be back soon enough.",

But the star of our trip was the Roast Turkey Sandwhich with avocado and a fried egg.  It's easy to see the quality and care of the turkey roasted on site.

    "text": "My family and I had dinner at the Salty Sow on August 15, 2015.  Our reservations were for 6:30 pm and we were seated promptly.  The restaurant is bigger on the inside than it looks.  The table/seating was comfortable and roomy.  The ambiance was great and even the background music enjoyable and not overly loud.  The happy hour was certainly happy. The Top Shelf drinks were indeed top shelf and smooth.  We tried the chorizo stuffed mushrooms, pork belly, deviled eggs, honey rosemary chicken, chili duck fat fried fries and green chili pork.  All were amazing!  For the entrees we had two of the mixed grills and hanger steak plates.  The mixed grill consisted of a bone-in fillet, crispy fried chicken thigh and pork belly with smashed potatoes.  The hanger streak included green onion mashed potatoes.  All three plates were seasoned, cooked and plated to perfection.  Chef Brandon turned out a wonderful meal, perfectly timed.  Michael was our waiter and was excellent.  He was friendly without being intrusive, knowledgeable on all of the specialty drinks and menu items.  He seemed to know what we wanted or needed before we asked.  Whenever you have a restaurant that hits the mark on all counts, you have a winner.  The prices were reasonable and the portions were perfect  for a hearty appetite.  I will be back and I certainly will recommend it to family and friends.",

The fish breading came out rather dark and very greasy which is a sign that the grease needed changing. Also, the fish was not real firm (go to Oscar's Pier 83 for great fried fish) although it tasted fine. The fries tasted really good (duck fat does that for fries) but the longest fry on our plates was about 2 inches long with many of the other fries 1 inch or so (we label that as \"scrap inclusion\").

    "text": "Flying into Phoenix for my birthday before spending a few days up to Sedona to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary,  we were looking for a very good but casual restaurant for dinner, in proximity of our hotel, The Orange Tree Golf Resort on 56th.  We relied on one of my Paradise Valley friends to provide us with a recommendation.    THE SALTY SOW DID NOT DISAPPOINT  !   Our experience there was top notch from the moment we were greeted at the front desk, throughout the entire dining experience.  The open kitchen at the rear of a large dining room with white-washed brick walls and enough room between tables where even \"Lickiweaks\" would find it difficult to listen in on a private conversation, had me convinced right off the bat,  that the recommendation for dinner at Salty Sow was an excellent choice.  Selecting one of the Craft Drafts that would be to my liking seemed difficult if it weren't for our waiter,  a very engaging gent' named MICHAEL, who could answer any question about each of the 12 (all) local brewery choices and helped me make a selection that met my taste in beer (I was born and raised in Germany)  FYITM Imperial Pale Ale was \"spot on\".   My wife opted for her favorite cocktail.  Mary and I decided to share the BRUSSELS SPROUT CAESAR as our appetizer.   Outstanding dish !   For our Main course,  we each selected the same RAINBOW TROUT ALMONDINE ....... not a single bone to be found  .....   its almonds toasted in BROWN BUTTER  (same as my mother used to bake some of her seafood dishes) was \"Killer\" !  The mild fish was matched with a combo of lentils, spinach, quinoa and crunchy capers and came with housemade tartar sauce.   Yum !  Bottom line:    Put SALTY SOW on your MUST visit list.  (of course, with some Texan influence, they are also known for their roasted pork dishes)   Prices are in the \"easily affordable\" range.  Noise level was \"moderate\" on a Tuesday,  couldn't say if it is - as some reviewers posted - a bit noisy on weekends.   (with a menu including eight House Specialties,  that's understandable)  Jerry Menlo Park, CA",

We came for their buy one entree get one free event. My husband and I were really looking forward to their hanger steak dishes since it looked so appetizing in pictures. My hubby is a meat eater and he loves his steak.  We started with the mushrooms and while they smelled very good, the taste wasn't quite there. The toast that came with it was nice but I honestly wasn't sure what to do with it.  Then came the steaks- very pretty plate with thought put into it. The mashed potatoes were delicious, with a touch of sweetness in them. They were creamy and light. The steak was tender but there were only 5 pieces on the plate. I think my hubby died inside a little when he saw the plate. He ate his meal and enjoyed it but he ended up leaving hungry and I felt bad. For $24 a plate on regular days, there's just no way I would pay that much for such a small piece of steak. If I want to keep eating and Yelping, I gotta stay on budget! But with that said, for $12 a plate, it was a great deal.  As my husband put it, when he eats steak, he wants an honest to goodness piece, not Gordon Ramsay's bull**** portions. So I'll have to leave him at home next time.",

The weather was pretty nice, so we chose to sit outside on the patio. The restaurant is situated in front of Walmart, but the patio was angled so that you wouldn't even know it.  We both ordered arnold palmer's which had fresh lemonade. I was having trouble deciding what to eat as the menu offered a lot of enticing entrees. I asked the waitress for recommendations, and she said she received lots of good feedback for the lamb burger. This was the best decision ever! If I could have married this burger I would, but sorry lamb burger I'm already taken. Why was it so good? Well, it was cooked perfectly at medium rare, with a garlic olive tapenade that complimented the meat, the creamy goat cheese topped it off to flavor greatness.   Seriously! Get the lamb burger!  My husband had the open faced BLT, a sandwich with bacon, pork belly, fried green tomatoes and a fried egg on top. This was also fantastic, I liked mine better but this still did not disappoint.   I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu, but I'm not so sure if I will as I'm in love with that burger!",

    "text": "Our experience here started with a server dumping the stuffed mushroom appetizer all over my husband. Well, accidents happen ... and we were willing to move on. However, not once did the manager come over to check on my husband. His leg had been burned and his clothes ruined. But no, no one checked on us.   Then his burger came out well done (when he ordered it rare). Additionally my pork taco came out with an under cooked (raw!) egg on it.   At that point, I asked to speak to the manager who really could not have been more condescending. We actually had to convince her that the server spilled the food on us and that we didn't do it!  The servers actually both told her they were responsible!  Questioning the guest is not the way to instill confidence in us coming back!    We used to love this place and even introduced friends to it. But not any more. What a complete disappointment.",

Great happy hour prices and food options. There are definitely some good twists on traditional restaurant food and some options you don't typically see. I had their fish and chips and strawberry shortcake dessert. The dessert was out of this world and no complaints about the fish and chips. Non happy hour can be a little spendy but at least the food is good quality. Will come back if I'm ever on that side of town.",

    "text": "5-Star Food, 2-Star Service  The service at the Salty Sow drives me away, but the food keeps me coming back. I've been here a half dozen times over the past 2 years. We first came in on Labor Day when they were offering buy one, get one free entrees. Service was great our first time and has been terrible every time since.  I visited this past week with a friend for our weekly Happy Hour. I asked our server about one of the cocktails and I assumed he must have been new because he gave me the look like he had no idea what was in it. That's fine if you don't know - just tell me you need to double check. I decided on the Blanche - homemade blood orange frozen margarita - which was great; not too sweet and generous with the tequila. My friend had the bourbon sour, which also was heavy on the bourbon - thumbs up!  Happy Hour offers $2 off signature cocktails, which run $7-$9. They also have a nice variety of small bites for either $5 or $7. First round, we got all three tacos (pork belly, spit-roasted pork, and catfish) and the crispy brussels sprout leaves. The food was delicious! I loved the pork belly taco and my friend raved about the catfish. The fried egg on both pork tacos was cooked perfectly. The brussels sprouts were amazing. I find too many places make them too crispy. These were cooked perfectly and the golden raisins added just the right amount of sweetness. I am normally not a huge fan of raisins, especially in savory foods, but they hit the mark on this dish.  First round of apps and drinks completely gone for 10 minutes and no sign of our server. I had to flag him down to get another cocktail - this time The Petey (Deep Eddy grapefruit vodka, mint, orange, agave & soda) and an order of the honey rosemary honey dipped fried chicken and the chicken liver mousse. The Petey is a great summer drink - again, not too sweet and generous with the booze. The chicken was spot on - so moist and not greasy at all. The chicken liver mousse was for my better half who told me that I had better plan to sleep at my friend's house if I wasn't bringing an order home. It is his favorite app in the Valley.  Half way through our second round, the server asked if we wanted the check. No he did not ask if we wanted any more food or another round of drinks - the check. I said, \"No, but we would love another round of drinks.\" Halfway through that round, the check was dropped, followed shortly thereafter by our server letting us know he was leaving. Did we want to close out? Mind you, this was at 8:25 PM. If this was midnight and we'd just been sitting there for hours, I can get it. And this is why it will be several months before I come back.  I've also had the entrees on previous visits (the chicken thighs, halibut, and beef shoulder stand out) and I've yet to have a dish that I have not loved. Please Salty Sow, raise your service game up to the level of your food quality.",

One word: outdtanding!  Excellent variety and our server watched to make sure we had enough fresh grilled bread. My companion ordered the beef shoulder, and I ordered the prime rib (beef whore, don't judge me). Both were amazing. Shoulder was so tender, and had great carrots and potatoes, while my prime was like butter. We finished off with a very sweet complimentary champagne toast and shared creme brulee.  Will absolutely go here again. Snaps to everyone from the front to the back.",

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday on Monday and we were both pleased! Our server was super helpful in helping me find a good vegetarian meal that would fill me up! I got the vegetable antipasto with a side of quinoa and lentils (which is cooked in butter not animal stock). It was so good, the vegetables were delicious and there was a great variety, I really liked the roasted carrots and arugula salad. I don't even remember what my boyfriend got, I think pork that had a little bit of bacon on top or something? Idk but he loved it! I was worried that since we had been talking about going for months that his expectations would be too high, but it met his high expectations! Also they offered us a free birthday brownie and ice cream but we were getting him dessert after so we declined haha. Great experience though I'll recommend to meat lovers!",

So it's was Salty Sow time.   We walked in and the place is jammed packed and loud. Not music loud but people loud. We got lucky and got one of the last open tables. Woo hoo.   We were greeted by our server pretty quickly and got our water glasses and our own water bottle for refills.   I ordered off the daily special menu. Got the Ribeye tacos and a side of Bacon Mac & Cheese. So the ribeye tacos had guacamole, pickled onions, cilantro and huge chunks of ribeye. These where huge tacos. It was pretty spicy for me but really good. Very filling and enjoyed it. Only problem it was dripping with ribeye oil but that's ok. The tacos came with a side of beans with chunks of pork. I'm a big fan of beans and this was good. Those chunks of pork really made it so good.   I had to get the bacon Mac & Cheese. It was crazy good. Sprinkled with bacon on top. That bacon really made the Mac & cheese. I'll have no problem ordering this again.   My wife ordered the PV salad. Baby kale, with avocado, candied almonds, chicken breast, dates, blue cheese with a creamy dressing. This was so good and huge. When my wife took a few bites she said I wouldn't mind coming back to this place. She's never said that. She really liked it and I tried it and it was so good.   The service was really good. Our server was very good. Really informed on the menu. He kept on bringing new bottles of water when the bottles got low. He kept on checking on us. So service was really good.   Overall, we had a really good meal but I took off one star off cause of the really oily tacos, but all the other food was really good. Great service. Fun and lively atmosphere. Everyone was having a really good time. So it was really good and we will most likely be back.",

    "text": "I wish I could give this place a 0 star review. My boyfriend and I went in there to start our dinner off at the bar with happy hour planning to have dinner following. The bar server was absolutely HORRID. Absolute garbage. We had to basically be assertive to stop the bartender to ask to order a drink, and we wanted to order food (a good amount too) but he or she never even asked. We were not greeted. We had to again assertively stop the bartender ask to pay out right away. We immediately left and went to a competitor a mile down the road.   My boyfriend and I have been around the industry for a while so to be as excited as we were to try Salty Sow and have that start to make us so uncomfortable we felt like we had to leave, says volume. You can assure we will not be spreading the word to try here, actually quite the opposite. Wish I had a picture of the older lady bartender but I will post of the horrible male bartender who made us so cringe worthy we left.   Wish we could have tried the food, but sadly because of the customer service we won't be back.",

Deets below:  Truffle Deviled Eggs (5/5). At both locations, these are some of the best deviled eggs I've ever had. Creamy and light with the perfect truffle flavor. Highly recommend.  Duck Fat Fries (4/5). If you love French fries and aioli this dish is for you! The fries were perfectly seasoned and the portion was generous.  Pork Belly (5/5). Tender, pull-apart meat with killer sides. This entree kicks a**.  Fried Green Tomatoes (3/5). These were overly breaded and I didn't love the guacamole on top. I would skip next time.  Banana Foster Beignet (5/5). The banana ice cream is so delicious, it tastes homemade! The beignets are nice and crisp with fresh bananas inside. DELISH!",

I remembered from years ago the green chile pork stew. It was on the buffet and as delicious as I remembered. The omelet was light and fluffy, and the made from scratch biscuits were one of the best I've ever had.  It was a perfect day to sit on the patio! Our server, Corey, was amazing too. Very friendly and engaging. Took care of us, but didnt check in too often,if you know what I mean.  Next time we go, we will request him for sure!  If you've never been, or like me, haven't been in awhile, you need to check it out! All the meats smoked in house and everything made from scratch with fresh ingredients. Corey was proud to tell us they don't even have a walkin freezer! Impressive!",

    "text": "We visited Salty Sow about 2 years ago and it was a very memorable experience that involved great food and cocktails. We decided to visit again about 2 weeks ago. The second experience didn't even come close to the first time we dined there. It was a quiet Sunday afternoon, the restaurant had a few diners. We were excited to find some happy hour deals on Sunday. The drinks were average, nothing was mind blowing in complexity or flavor profile. The real disappointment was the small bites. We ordered a few plates to share. The ceviche was bland and needed more citrus and tartness. The duck fat fries were lacking duck fat, in a blind taste test it would be hard to decipher regular fries and these fries. The portion size was small and the crispness factor was nonexistent. (The fries were way better during our first visit). I felt the stuffing of shrimp wontons were also missing some flavor components. The sauce that was served with it attempted to save the dish but failed. All that being said we had one delicious dish, the rosemary fried chicken and biscuit was very good.  The biscuit was buttery, the chicken was fried to perfection and the honey rosemary sauce drizzled on the chicken went very well with the dish. The server was very friendly and the service was fast. The overall experience was a let down because we had such high expectations from our last visit.",

    "text": "Went there to celebrate our daughter's 36th bday.  It was during brunch.  She and her friends had been there and said the food and service were excellent.  It was a buffet.  Ok.  Well, our servers didn't really give us good service (something even our daughter and her friends were aghast about) and to be quite frank-the food was mediocre.    I have a dairy allergy-which made it almost impossible to really get a True feel for the place.  Decor was fun and welcoming, chairs on the patio where they put the 10 of us were comfortable.  But when you spend $25 for a buffet and not even coffee and tea are included and most of the foods are covered in cheese and contain the food you are allergic too, it was extremely overpriced.  Add the bad service and I'm sure you get the idea. For my $33 tab I ate:  2 egg white veggie omelet, 1/2 stale bagel w/ homemade jam, some fresh berries, 1 slice of bacon.  I suppose if I were a bigger eater I could've tried the carving station pork loin or the dried out and rather burnt looking sausage \"balls\" (they weren't patties and they weren't links).  Pastries were there, but obviously another area I couldn't try.    Would I go back?  NO.  The biggest offenses being the waitstaff and the price.  Literally could've gone to Eggstacy (which we love) and had a much better meal for half the price.",

The Beef Shoulder and Carnitas were delicious but the Sowburger, which we ordered medium well. came out medium rare. We would have notified our waitress of the mistake but she came to our table immediately after our food was delivered, before we even had a chance to take our first bite, and then did not return until my husband and I finished our meals. In the meantime, our water glasses and water bottle were dry. We were never offered a water refill. Needless to say our kids did not eat the rare burger and only a few of the \"old dry fries.\" Thankfully the waitress was able to take the burger off the bill but we left with two hungry kids and a very lukewarm experience. We will not be returning to Salty Sow after tonight's experience. Disappointing.",

Their Halloween, BOBO on main courses is just too good to pass up.  Top it off with Happy Hour drinks and the value is immense.  My wife's fish and chips (with duck fat fries) was really, really good.  My nightly special of chorizo stuffed pork belly was, in a phrase, out of this world.  Sitting there with a good drink and excellent food watching game 6 of the World Series would have been good enough, but top it off with spectacular service, and you have a night to remember.  Our server, Brenna, was simply amazing.  Sadly, she had to put up with a couple seated next to us that were simply rude and abusive.  Brenna handled it beautifully.  She was so personable, understanding, accommodating, and professional - to them and to us.  We could not have asked for a better server in any environment.  Hopefully, management recognizes what a gem they have in Brenna.  Needless to say, we will be back - many times and would consider ourselves most fortunate to be served by Brenna again.",

We were still enjoying cocktails but after being told by the manager Doug that there was no place/room for us to partake in the music unless standing on a line, we chose to leave. Crazy and disappointing that we weren't able to enjoy the musician. (Who, BTW, is phenomenal). Just a review but not the best in customer service or loyalty. We will be changing date night venue.",

The dessert bar was underwhelming and looked unappetizing.  The waitress takes your omelet order. Our omelets were good.  The breakfast potatoes need improvement as there weren't enough \"potatoes\" in it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place and I would give it another go in hopes that small improvements can be made to make it 5 stars.",

We ordered the duck fat fries to start and the fries were hot, the poached egg was perfect, and the Bernaise was great as well. I followed that up with the Prime Rib cooked medium rare and boy am I happy that I did. I'll definitely be back to explore more of the menu here. I also had 2 or 4 cocktails- they're perfectly balanced and delicious. Great restaurant with delicious food and drinks.",

We've been fans since Salty Sow's first year in operation. They just keep fine tuning an already great running engine. Food and service is always consistently good. We typically ask for the same server when we book our reservation, but occasionally we just spontaneously show up and take the luck of the draw - and it's always been good. Last night we decided to sit on the patio for dinner because the night was cool. Service out there was spot on, and Doug, the GM came around several times to make sure all was well.  The appetizers are delicious. I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes, though the ONLY criticism I'd give is that they give you 3 on a plate - and to share there should really be 4. I've made this suggestion many times. The guacamole with it is more than enough for 4 pieces.  The pork shoulder, their beans, green chile pork, prime rib - ALL delicious and consistent. And if you make a meal of a salad, you WILL make a meal and a half with their salads.  Though often \"noisy\" during peak hours, I LOVE the vibe of this place. It's where we go when we have guests in town and want to treat them to a delicious meal and consistently great service.",

But as a warning, the door is very heavy so be prepared to use your strength so you don't look like me struggling.   We ordered several different items and really pigged out, so I was able to try almost everything in the menu. Wednesday's is prime rib day, and they do not disappoint. Large slabs of meat, cooked beautifully red throughout....delicious. I ordered the chicken (yes, I know. Chicken at a pig place...) but it was amazing. The skin was crispy while the inside was juicy. There was not a single complaint of the food items ordered.   Our waiter was extremely patient with our group of ~20 and our food was delivered with no errors and very timely.   Overall, delicious food, and definitely a meat lovers paradise.",

The small plates are reasonably priced, and it's fun ordering several things and sharing with everyone. Love, love, LOVE the duck fat fries. They're delicious, and the egg on top is like icing on the cake. Seriously, where have these fries been all my life?  Truffled deviled eggs are very good. Crispy chicken thighs are fantastic. If you like fried chicken, get this. The thighs are moist, fried perfectly, and just fantastic. Crispy brussel sprout leaves are a nice side to accompany the chicken.  Only thing I would skip are the eggplant fries. They're tender, but they lack flavor. The breading needs some work. They're a good portion size, but I was disappointed, especially since I love eggplant.  For dinner, I had the fish special, and it was amazing. I want to say it was trout. Even if you aren't huge on fish, it's worth gambling to see how good Salty Sow can cook it up.  This place is worth the drive if you don't like in Scottsdale. Cannot wait to go back and eat half the menu.",

    "text": "HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  Imagine you had a long day. And you wanted to relax and indulge in something incredibly scrumptious, delectable, and sinfully good.  Well... Think Sow.  Salty Sow.  We were over near the PV Mall and we decided, spur of the moment, to get something nearby. We thought of sushi and a few other places. But then we saw the three golden neon arrows pointing to the front door of the Salty Sow.   AMBIANCE/MOOD: The Salty Sow has that nouveau feel to it. The bar is off to the left as you enter, with a large kitchen straight in front of you. You see a lot of wood and interesting lighting (photos). But the feeling is very intimate. Even with other diners nearby, you cannot hear their conversations. The clientele is mixture of millennials and older, with a dozen or so sitting at both the bar and the dinning area.   MENU: Like most places in the Valley, the Happy Hour menu is a jumping off point for the  Dinner menu. When you are seated you are given both menus. There seems to be no pressure to order off of one or the other. The focus of the food is all things pork. So if you love bacon, then you have found your Nirvana in this life. LOL  Almost all the items on the Happy Hour menu are $5,00 and you find things like: Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Pork Belly Tacos and Braised Beef Tacos and much, much more  SERVICE: Everything is relaxed and our server Holly was excellent.  Folks stop by and ask about your meal and dishes are bused quickly  FOOD: Okay, the best thing we tried was the HH Fried Chicken that came with a honey glaze and a large sweet potato biscuit (photo).  Even here there was bacon on the underside of the chicken.  It was moist, flavorful and delicious!  We also order two tacos which were equally good that came with a fried egg on top (photo).  But you must try the Duck Fat Fries, which were seasoned with herbs and salt.  It also comes with a poached egg yoke on top (photo).  Great stuff.  PRICES: Everything at Happy Hour is $5.00 and it ends at 6:30 with the ringing of a cow bell.  Ahh, \"we need more cow bells!\"  LOL  Our bill came to $37.50 before taxes and gratuities, including two items to go and a soft drink ($2.50).  Debbie Downer: Just before the check, we asked our server if we could order two items to go.  We also asked what the up-charge would be.  To our surprise, she said it would be the same price.  As we were leaving, the Culinary Manager approached us and said:  \"We normally don't allow people to order off the Happy Hour menu to go.\"  As I stamered to say we had checked first with our server, she said: \"I'm going to let it go this time, but don't do it again.\"",

I don't normally order desserts when dining but I did here because I did not eat much of my food and boy am I glad.The Banana Foster Beignets (excuse me as I wipe the drool from my mouth) are delicious!!!! So. Damn. Good. As I type this, I am having a sudden craving for it! Now, I frequent Salty Sows only for this dessert.

We ordered the 2 filets and they wouldn't cook each one different. The potatoes were also very cold. We received our steaks rare when we asled for medium well.

Service-  Amazing and attentive service! I wish I could remember the individuals name who provided service but he was very easy going, gave great recommendations and kept the refills going of both water and drinks.    Food- All around amazing. All of the dishes were fantastic.   Truffled Deviled Eggs- If you like deviled eggs make sure to get them... If you don't like deviled eggs.. Get them! You will love them. Duck Fat Fries- Duck Fat and Fries.... Nothing else really needs to be said.   Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken- Man ol man.  This dish was phenomenal.  The chicken is very well done and biscuit.. perfect.  French Dip-Roated Rare- If you enjoy the combo of prime rib, horseradish and au ju then you will love this meal.  Perfect spice, and flavors.  White Corn Cheese Grits-  Great side dish.  Big enough to share with quite a few. Fried Green Tomatoes-  Solid sharing dish for those who want to be semi Healthy  Drinks- All were great! Between the 3 of us we tried the Maple Glazed Old Fashion, Little Larry, Copper State Mule, Mr Shaw and the Petey.  I would have to give the nod to the Mr. Shaw.  Atmosphere-  Lively, busy, fun and slightly loud when it picks up.  Comfortable seating, great lighting, anything and everything you could ask for.   This may become my new happy hour spot.",

    "text": "So disappointed. Another trendy Scottsdale restaurant with nice decor that's fails miserably in the quality food dept. cheap products were obvious. The \"Italian sausage\" on their cold platter prob sat in the fridge too long to be served. Had a grayish tint... Weird.. Have the chef sample the meat and cheese platter at Postino if they want a benchmark. Had a table of 10 for a bday party and everyone agreed that this is a have a drink only place after multiple meals failed to satisfy anyone. Went to dinner starving and left my mash potatoes untouched and ate half the prime rib sandwich. Honestly I think hey are just using cheap products, need a new distributor.  Always hate to complain because our waitress worked her butt off . left spending over $35 and still hungry.",

    "text": "We ate here for the first time tonight.  While the food was tasty and the menu was interesting, the service was just so bad I can't recommend this restaurant. We were seated right away on the patio (a plus! and we thought a good sign).    Ambiance - too loud outside.  1 star There was a very good local musician playing.  Unfortunately, it was very very very loud.  Loud enough to require constant yelling on the part of everyone sitting on the patio.  Perhaps it would have been quieter inside.  Outdoor cooling system broken.   Service - Terrible.  No stars We placed our order shortly after sitting.  We ordered appetizers and drinks.  Appetizers arrived right away.  Drinks were missing. We finished the app and 40 minutes later a runner brought our our entrees.  No drinks yet.  Halfway through the entree our waitress finally reappeared - it had been almost an hour since we had seen her. She refilled our water, but since we both had food in our mouths we couldn't actually talk. Still no drinks. Disappointing because the drink menu looked fantastic and I really wanted to try one.   Food - pretty tasty - 3 stars Green Chili appetizer - great flavor. Just the right amount of spice and served with homemade tortillas. Good for two to share. Not big enough for more.  French dip - lots of meat. It is served rare. Good flavor, but not unique or different.  Fries are okay.  Nothing special.  Pork Belly Salad - excellent bacon and pork belly.  Great flavors.  Unique combination of ingredients. The pieces are too big, which made eating it awkward.  Make sure you have a knife (if you can find your waitress).  But, this is excellent.",

We live in East Mesa so traveling to a destination restaurant and falling in love with it is a great experience and makes the \"travel\" worth it all.  Unfortunately, we returned with a group of 6 for a birthday as we recommended the Sow for the great food and atmosphere.  The atmosphere, service and friendliness of staff was GREAT!!!  Unfortunately, the food on this visit was sub-par.  It was quite disappointing as we took a large group this time and only two people out of the six really enjoyed the food.  The Halibut and the Prime Rib were very good - probably a 3.5/4 out of 5.  However, the flank steak and the pork belly that everyone else got was not very good.  Pork belly was VERY tough, grey and overcooked.  Side (especially the grits) were terrible - they all seemed old and re-heated.  It was an unfortunate visit to a great restaurant.  We have always been a fan of the Roaring Fork as well but with so many restaurants in the area the food needs to come back to the standard of our first visit to really impress and keep a regular customer base.",

We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes at the recommendation of the server.  Unfortunately the app arrived at our table after the salad due to a lost ticket in the kitchen which is the only reason why I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5.  The Farm Salad was wonderful and my mom mentioned the dressing was probably the best she's ever tasted and was big enough for us to share.  I ordered the Bacon & Eggs which was rich and delicious.  Mom ordered the Bacon wrapped pork filet and the flavor permeated throughout the meat.  It had unbelievable flavor.  I had the Full Moon Belgium Wheat which was really nice if you like belgium wheat beers.  Salty Sow was an amazing find.",

The fact that a place uses OpenTable gives it a little boost in my book.  The waitress was very welcoming and friendly and did a great job explaining the menu and concept and welcoming me back.  I ordered the slow-roasted beef shoulder and was not disappointed.  The root vegetables in the dish were perfectly cooked.  I ordered their version of a Moscow mule and enjoyed it.  I'm glad I tried the restaurant again because I was pleased with the meal.  I don't know that it will become a regular place for me to dine, but I wouldn't be averse to going back if someone suggests it.  I'd be even more tempted to go if I received another BOGO mailer....",

He got the lamb burger and I got the pork medallions. He said his burger was pretty good (but like me, he wasn't keen on the fries), and my pork was *amazing*.  Just fantastic.   We also got drinks. A mojito for him and copper state mule for me. Both were surprisingly good!  We shared a crem brulee as well, and it was good!",

The banana beignets are literally one of the best desserts I've ever had. The fried chicken is bomb-tastic. Their stuffed mushrooms are little mouth-gasms. Their drinks are ah-mahz-ing. I haven't tried anything here I didn't like. THUMBS UP!!!!!!",

The french fries (pommes frites) that came with were very fresh and nicely seasoned. All and all I would return and perhaps try another dish but I would certainly take out another french dip.",

This outpost of the Texas restaurant was a little disappointing given our expectation.  We were expecting something like the Pig & Pickle in Scottsdale, but though the interior is what I'd call, country-sleek, the feel of the place was more akin to a high-end Carraba's (albeit with better food.)    Had the duck fat fries, the boudin fritters, brussels sprout caesar, and split the hanger steak.  And a couple beers, because it's a gastropub.  If I'm comparing this to other gastropubs or other smart casual restaurants, the food didn't stand out all that much to us.  The fries were fine, the boudin fritters a little less than fine, the salad was fine, and the steak was fine.  Everything felt a little heavy-handed and a tad over-seasoned.  We're definitely giving this place a second shot but not so sure we'd travel there regularly for the food.",

However, it isnt a dive bar... this place is going for the gastro-pub hip-American-new eatery... and if that's the theme, I need a LOT more from the kitchen.   Resorting to covering savory dishes in sugar, and smothering everything in oil is a culinary cop out...  Staff was professional and decor was awesome.

So happy to learn happy hour is every day, and honored through the entire restaurant, not just the bar!  The Brussels sprouts appetizer is amazing - I will start experimenting to replicate this at home. Quick fried shaved sprouts, tossed in agave with golden raisins and pecorino. Simple, but phenomenal!  The bone marrow crusted in bacon and gruyere was incredible and so rich and perfect.  The duck fat fries couldn't have been any better - serving them with the egg is brilliant!  The farm salad looked great - I'll probably get that next time.  I was a bit disappointed in the rotisserie pork. Nothing wrong with it - but not as good as when I make pork shoulder or picnic roast.  I am looking forward to coming back - the happy hour menu has a nice selection of $5 plates - and the cocktails are well thought out and well executed.",

But the standouts were the truffle deviled eggs, green eggs and ham, bananas foster beignets, and Brussels sprout Caesar  I'd like to see their version of my favorites lunches; like grilled cheese sandwiches, avocado and chicken club, hot wings, and I guess a beef burger on the dinner menu since I don't really care for lamb burgers. Lastly, that Brussels sprouts Caesar deserves to be on a chicken breast sandwich or even a burger.  It's freaking amazing!  I'll be back for sure to see what their chefs come up with next.  I am deducting 1-star for not having a burger.  Do they deserve that... maybe not, but Ill give it back when they give in to my food extortion!",

When we walked in the staff was very friendly greeting us and the place looked very upscale and nice.  The lighting was relaxing and there was an outdoor patio that was open to the inside of the restaurant which I like, makes the place feel more open.   There looked to be managers dressed in business suits walking around helping out the staff which I thought was nice, not sure if they were there because it just opened.  We looked at the menu and since we're both natives to Arizona (yes I know rare) we had never heard of some of the things on the menu but wanted to try.   We ordered something called Duck Fries, the fries are made in duck fat and vegetable oil and topped with a 110 min egg (looked poached) and came with some kind of bernay sauce, anyway it was fabulous!  I ordered a sangria which was very tasty, looked like it was made with mostly white wine and my boyfriend ordered kilt lifter (on tap) which was also excellent.  We ordered a spinach and artichoke dip which supposedly came out late (we didn't even notice) so the manager came over and said he took it off the bill.  Honestly if they were trying to make an impression they did, this is a great place for couples and families and the food and service are great.  We'll be coming back!",

    "text": "Wanted to love this place but food was subpar and service was awful. Server forgot to put our drink order in so we didn't get our cocktails till we were done with appetizers. Deviled eggs were good but very rich. We also had the green Verde stew, which the server-side was not spicy but actually was quite spicy.  We had the pork belly which was delicious but was served on ice cold grits. We also had the special sandwich of turkey, way too much turkey and was nothing special. It was served with \"duck fries\" although they just seemed like overcooked regular fries. For dessert we had the special, maple bread pudding. Yuck. We ate 2 bites and that was enough. Burnt on the bottom, dry throughout. Not good. Definitely won't return!",

    "text": "Rude bartender. My friend and I stop in for drinks at the bar regularly. They used to have a nice guy bartend the front. Lately it's a girl who is not the nicest. She has a bad attitude and never smiles. We go in a lot and she pretends like she's never seen us before.  Think her name is Jessica?  Manager kinda walks around but doesn't acknowledge customers or ask how their evening is going.   Not a happy atmosphere. Food is good, drinks are good. I will say though, their Moscow Mules are not that good. I get a better buzz off the ones at Oreganos and they are also cheaper.   Encountered an extremely creepy man at the bar. He was harassing my friend and I a few months ago and the bartender girl told us to be nice to him because he is a regular. Extremely inappropriate. He tried to assault someone in the parking lot that evening. As a customer I felt completely infuriated that she would tell us to be nicer to him when he was harassing us by being inappropriate, making a scene, and making us look bad by association since the bartender asked us to be nice to him. It was super uncomfortable after that. We soon closed out our tab and never went back.",

The pork shoulder, bone in filets and their farm salad are a few of our favorites. Live music and a fireplace creates a nice ambiance.",

I hate when restaurants don't update their online menu.  But the waitress did give us the online price. Everything we ordered was delicious.  Definitely will go back.",

However...The reason why I rated a 3 is because I got sick 2 hours after, and my husband soon followed. It wasn't just a stomach upset but there was legit vomiting and the other unpleasant thing...  Don't think we'll be back",
