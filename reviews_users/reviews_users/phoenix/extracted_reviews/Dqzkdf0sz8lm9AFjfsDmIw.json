The hottest greeted us right away and offered us to grab one of their drink specials (daily 5.00 specialty drinks) at the bar while our table was being set up.  We did have a reservation and I highly recommend you make one on a Friday night as they are pretty busy at this location.  Once we were seated, the hottest brought us water and took our drink and appetizer orders.  All the food we ordered came out pretty quick and soon after our dinner plates.  I had a steak, medium cooked with a potato and it was pretty good and tender, flavoring was perfect.  Not too salty or under seasoned.  Great atmosphere, lighting is dimmed at night.  A few other parties were there that evening and were pretty loud, if your looking for a quiet dinner, Friday night is probably not a good idea.  We didn't mind it one bit since we were a group as well.  I will be coming back to try other items on the menu.  The servings are pretty filling, make sure you have an appetite.",

We were able to get seated right away, that was the only good thing.  I am not exaggerating, we waited an HOUR...a FULL HOUR not almost an hour, before our entrees came out. (A monday night, 4 of us) Getting a water was impossible. I was finally able to get a glass of (tap) water on my 4th request.  The food....sooooo not worth it. I make a good rib eye but this was not close to comparable for a $66 rib eye steak (for 2) My baked potato was basic. My bf's chicken seafood dish was bland.  Never ever again.",

    "text": "In all honesty, I wasn't expecting a whole ton when my boyfriend brought me here for our anniversary.  (Now before I sound like a terrible girlfriend, in my defense, it's in Tempe Marketplace next to BevMo and Red Robin - not where I'd expect an outstanding steakhouse.)  But boy, was I wrong.  The steak was amazing.  I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert on steaks, but I thoroughly enjoyed mine.  It was very juicy, and tasty on its own - mind you, this is coming from someone who douses every steak she's ever eaten in A1.  Although they do seem to count the number of green beans they put on your plate (5, if I remember correctly), but it's not like anyone's there for the veggies.  I'd also highly recommend the twice baked potatoes for a side if you're not calorie conscious, and even if you are.  The service too, was exceptional.  Not in your face, but there when you needed them.  They had taken note that it was our anniversary, so every waiter and manager that came by made it a point to wish us, even remembering how long we had been together (I was a little taken aback, honestly).  Oh!  And they also served us this amazing cheesecake, on the house, since we chose to celebrate our anniversary with them.  I was stuffed as it is, but you know how girls are with desserts.  That said, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a decent steakhouse in this college town.  Like any decent steakhouse, it is a little on the pricey side, but well worth it.",

    "text": "Ate here for dinner with the bf last night. We arrived right around 415 PM and were greeted by the hostess. No one else in line and we had to wait to be seated and we couldn't figure out why. The dining room was very upscale and I was in jeans and shirt and that seemed to be OK.  About 5 minutes after we were seated Daniel our waiter came by. He was able to answer all of my questions about the menu. I got the Oscar Sirloin and the bf had the NY steak (I believe).   Fresh bread came promptly to our table and it was tasty, but they don't cut it all the way through so you have to slice it yourself which I found to be frustrating. Especially since they quarter it off center if that makes any sense.   Oscar Sirloin was cooked to my asking and it is topped with scallops, shrimp, and a bernaise sauce. Comes with a side (I opted for asparagus). It was quite delicious. My boyfriend said his was very good. His steak came with mushrooms, a salad, and for his additional side he opted for the garlic mash potatoes. I tried them, they were very garlicky and were overall OK.  The service was a little slow, Daniel was attentive at first but then disappeared for a little while. The manager Chris also came up to the table and the interaction was a little awkward but oh well.  I would definitely eat here again.  BF's steak classic + my Oscar Sirloin + 3 beers (2 bottles and one tap) about $92 with tax",

We sat for a good amount of time before our server came to our table. And that lack of timeliness was carried throughout the meal. But I wonder if the dining room would have had better service?

On a Saturday at 4:30pm we called for a table for 7 that night and we were able to get a table at 7:30pm.  The hostess asked if this was a birthday party and I mentioned that it was my friend's Bachelor Party.  We were seated by Chelsea, who was super nice. She gave a very descriptive and effective summary of the menu and all its options.  Plus in realizing that weren't local she gave us suggestions for places to hang out.  The steak was awesome, I had the prime rib lobster combo which was great.  When we all got our food, Chelsea came by to check whether our steaks were cooked at the level we all wanted.  The side dish I chose was the twice cooked potato (I'm a big fan of potatoes)... can't go wrong with a potato that has bacon stuffed in it.  We also split some appetizers.. I particularly loved the bacon-wrapped scallops and the baked shrimp.  And throughout the night different servers came by to congratulate the Bachelor.. all of them were very friendly.",

I didn't know the steak with the shrimp is small and not a meal so DONT order that! It's a trap! They lost a star for the scam. I come to a steakhouse than I expect a full steak not steak bites! I spent over 40 bucks for tony pieces of steak. What a rip off! I told the bartender that I thought I was clear when I said I wanted a 10 ounce filet but he just laughed and I was stuck with some bullshit toddler sized food while I had to stare at the guy next to me as he enjoyed his huge piece of steak!",

We did not have an appetizer but did have two pieces of frozen grocery store key lime pie, two large glasses of wine, and two Keg Classic meals (salad & side of veggies included).  I had a choice on my filet to have a \"bleu cheese crust\" and it came TOPPED with a bleu cheese compote - no crust !!!  The topping was good but ...  The meat tasted fine and it was tender but no special flavor from grilling or broiling in butter or ... The side mushrooms, green beans & bread were fine.  My iceberg wedge salad was okay, there weren't hardly any tomatoes and the \"bleu cheese\" dressing was just watery stuff you could get at a fast food restaurant - meaning NO actual BLEU CHEESE in the dressing or on the salad !!!  My garlic mashed potatoes didn't have any garlic flavor or butter flavor or heavy cream or secret spices or anything to talk about.  My husband's caesar salad was fine, rice was basically packaged rice but the kicker was his prime rib.  He was told it was their specialty and smoked or marinated or something for 24 hours.  It was tiny and had fat all throughout (hardly any meat).  Yes, prime rib is fatty but that is the outside edge not 75% of the dish.  And he said it basically didn't have any flavor either.  I know this will sound low class but Longhorn's food (salads, bread, desserts, filets and especially prime ribs) are beyond EXCELLENT !!!  Every time !!  And for a fourth of the price.  Maybe it's just a trendy place or the \"ambiance\" or people think they have to spend tons of money to get quality food & service plus excellent flavors & large portions but we disagree.  Sorry !!!",

I came in with average expectations and was totally impressed during my visit.  I was with some wonderful business associates who frequent this place and were helpful in guiding to the best options.  Ambience: (4 stars): Its a current, updated look with some high back booths and dim lighting.  It's a cool atmosphere and a little loud.  Formal enough but not stuffy.  Service: (4 stars): The waitress was very nice, did a pretty good job keeping drinks full and was very sweet.  All smiles and friendly.  FOOD: Happy hour menu, tried a few things:  Prime Rib Sliders (5 stars): These were awesome!  The meat was extremely tender and thick sliced.  They were very flavorful and crusted in black pepper.  The sliders were served with a Dijon-horseradish aoli and were just wonderful.  Could have eaten them all night.  On a soft roll, too, which was fresh and dense enough.    Keg Sliders (4.5 stars): These were delicious too!  Soft, tender meat that bit away immediately with each bite, even though from the grilled look of them it seemed like I would have to dig in a little.    Scallops with Bacon (4 stars): You get three skewers, each with bacon and scallops.  The scallops are small but taste great and are a nice pairing with the bacon.    Shrimp Cocktail (4 stars): Jumbo shrimp, well prepared, with a spicy, aromatic cocktail sauce.  They were delicious, even though I don't normally order cocktails.  I highly enjoyed them.  Go give them a try!",

They had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their New Year's Eve dinner, but I skipped over that...  I have to say, I loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was done correctly - not rubbery or charred and *gasp* it was actually de-veined. I can't tell you how I've gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasn't de-veined. So that alone got a little happy dance from me.  Food was a bit on the salty side, but it didn't make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, which was great!  Hubby ordered his prime rib, but they didn't have it blue which was the way he wanted it. It's all good, they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib I've seen in a long time...  For an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops. I am a firm believer of 'bacon makes everything good!' and it did. The sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful. The fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind - light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me, yet didn't make me feel like I was about to chip any teeth. ;)  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!",

    "text": "From the start I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder from the reservation making process.   Monday morning I find out that I need to make a reservation for 8 people for dinner that night, at 5:30 or 6 p.m. So I quickly get on the phone with the Keg who's answering machine says they are closed but to leave a message and someone will get back to me. Well 5 hours later no one had called me back yet, so I tried again, same thing, I pressed \"zero\" thinking maybe this would work, it did, I got someone in an office somehow. I explained to them what I needed and had been waiting for a phone call back for hours. He didn't seem very concerned, and took my information again, and said someone would call me back. Great! More waiting around. Business dinner, kinda important people, cant wait around all day.   So I wait, and the hostess calls me back about 15 minutes later. She had a bit of an attitude. She mad it seem like a hassle for us to want to be coming in for dinner. I wasn't sure how quickly we would be able to get there and it might be closer to 6 than 5:30, this was unacceptable to her, \"Its going to have to be 5:30\" Again I explained we would be there as soon as we could. Hello! 8 people, business dinner, one check, minimum $40 a head, what is the problem? You say great see you then and hang up, don't give me shit! I can just as easiyly take the group somewhere else. She told me that the servers would be standing around wondering where the table was and that is why we had to be there by 5:30, NO! Sorry we are not here to cater to the server, Ugh! Sorry done ranting but it was very rude, and for the money we planned to spend I really don't think I needed to deal with the Spanish Inquisition to make dinner reservations.   Whatever, long story short, we showed up when we did, sat down when we pleased, all was okay in the world. Dinner was fantastic! The server was a doll, helped to suggest a great wine, walked us through the menu perfectly. Everything was essentially seamless. The timing was perfect! This is  probably one of the hardest things to get right in a place like this, and they nailed it.   So all in all, even though the hostess gave me a hard time, we had a blast.   Thank you!  PS: Get the mushrooms and garlic mashed, with whatever cut of meat you get, they are all good!",

Yes, it was kinda late and I'm sure you wanted to go home and yes, we were indecisive at times, but you gave us comfortable space to let us mull over the menu. You gave us great suggestions for drink pairings, and you were friendly, helpful and attentive when we needed you!  Most of all, thanks for reminding me why I love this steakhouse so much. The steak was tender and juicey, the lobster had a great firm texture and was flavorful. Our cesaer saled wasn't drenched in dressing and of course the complimentary bread was warm and soft.",

    "text": "This review is mostly based off of happy hour.  I haven't really been for dinner service outside of the bar area, so I'll keep my review to what I know.  Good happy hour drinks.  Orange slice martini is fantastic, nice and smooth and just the right amount of citrus-y sweetness.  The margarita is quite nice as well, just not as much of a standout as the orange slice.  They have good prices on glasses of wine and beer as well - that being said, we always return to the orange slice.    The bar menu isn't great, but it isn't a detriment either.  Nachos are standard bar nachos with generic chips, overly lime-y guacamole and a light layer of cheese.  Nothing special.    The Prime Rib sandwich is tender and tasty.  I do love the house-made potato chips that they serve free in the bar area.  Quite tasty and nicely salted.    Go for the drinks, get a couple snacks - but don't expect too much from the food.  Service has always been reliable and pleasant if not outstanding.",

First the manager heard that there was a nut allergy at our table, so he personally came over with an ingredients menu to reassure us there was nothing to worry about in our dishes. That was awesome! Our server was patient and knowledgeable when it came to helping us choose a dish and wine to pair with it. I never had to look around for my server. I'd request the guy with a pony tail again any time! Lastly he presented us with champagne to celebrate again our special day. Couldn't have been a better dining experience thank you!",

I love how consistent they are with the quality of service and the extras for the kids.  The service is a little lacking compared to most Canadian Kegs I've been to, simply because the staff seemed so much younger and less professional, but it was still really good.  The food quality was excellent, but the portions are very Canadian (read: smaller than US portions) while the prices are still what you would expect from Vancouver yet in an area where the cost of living is about 1/3rd.  For the money, I'd probably rather hit Ruths Chris..minus the kids :)",

    "text": "Sorry to anyone who likes this place, but The Keg is a big, fat disappointment - just like the parties with the same name always were back in college. To be fair, we only went for happy hour, but the specialty drink we tried and the appetizer we ordered were both really gross. In my opinion, a restaurant needs to make a good impression at the bar because a lot of people, myself included, try places out by ordering a drink and appetizer or two. Given how bad what we tried was, what incentive do we have for returning for a bigger meal?   From the outside, The Keg looks like your run-of-the-mill steakhouse; once we got inside, however, we were shocked at how sleek and upscale the decor was. The bathrooms, in particular, were gorgeous and super-clean. When we went to sit at the bar, we were expecting some really classic cocktails and satisfying appetizers. The happy hour drink special was an orange martini, so I thought I'd try it. My husband got a Heineken (1/2 off during happy hour), which can't be messed up.   To eat, we ordered the sliders, which were $9.95; they didn't have any happy hour food specials. The martini was really sweet and tasted like it didn't have a drop of alcohol in it; it kind of reminded me of Sunny-D, which I hated growing up and now wouldn't serve to children if you paid me. The sliders were even worse. They were supposed to be prime-rib sliders, but I would have rather had ground chuck. The meat was chewy and fatty and reminded us of the sausage in an Egg McMuffin (which I like but wasn't expecting on a slider). There were also no toppings like onion or tomato - just a sauce or piece of cheese on each one. Instead of fries on the side, there were just measly little fried onions. Blech. We could have gone to Ruby Tuesday's right next door and gotten better sliders!   In the end, we didn't spend more than $22 or so, but being a happy hour fanatic, I know that there are plenty of other places (Latitude 30 is a notable example) where we could go and spend the same amount and get some great appetizers and drinks. We definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "Being someone who is not a fan of red meat, I don't go to steak restaurants very often.  But my best friend wanted to eat here and she was buying so... kind of a no brainer.  Our waiter, Damien, was very helpful.  I asked him for advice on different steaks, he asked how I like mine cooked, I told him well done (steak lovers, don't criticize, I prefer my meat NOT mooing!).  He recommended the New York strip so that's what I got.  It was very tasty and the baked potato I had with it was fabulous.  My friend however, ordered filet mignon, which was so rare it pretty much should've still had hooves and a bell around its neck, but she likes it that way apparently.  Hers, however, was a very bad cut of meat - it had this massive section of fat in it.  Even the waiter was appalled.  He had the manager come over to check it out and the manager gave us free dessert and took some money off the price of my friend's filet.  We had the brownie sundae for dessert and it was delicious!  I wish I could've eaten more of it!  Overall, my meal was really good.  I wish my friend had gotten a better filet but then there wouldn't have been free dessert and I am certainly not going to complain about free dessert.  Despite not being a huge fan of steak I would definitely go back to the Keg.",

The food:  besides the bread and butter- I got a New York and my friend got a Top Sirloin-  the New York was very salty and the Top Sirloin- well I can get a better steak at Apple Bee's.

Steak was pretty dry when I was eating it and I had to force myself on. Once again the lobster tail was very good and I'm thankful I had that to go along with my meal. Pre plate, I requested soup and of the choices the waitress gave me I made a selection, she came back and told me they didn't have the soup! All they had was French onion soup and that was honestly nasty. Also the drinks were good we ordered several... Our total bill was almost $200...overall for the price I feel I should've went to another comparable steakhouse if that amount of money is in play, such as Mastros or the Capital Grille. The Keg seems like it has potential though, and I would give it one additional chance to see if they disappointment me again because certain aspects of the meal were good.",

I have ordered everything from the Filet Mignon to the Teriyaki chicken, to a plain ol salad and have never been disappointed in the wait staff or my meal.  I gotta say the bread they give is AH-MAZ-ING. It comes out pipping hot fresh from the oven, covered in a black cloth to keep warm and sided with a delicious moose butter. I could fill up on their bread alone. In fact, I have asked for more bread to have with my meal and they brought it at no extra charge.  If you have a special request, they are always willing to accommodate. One time I went in, I wanted their mandarin cranberry walnut salad made into a dinner portion (not the small side one they have on the menu) and I wanted chicken on it. Not a problem. I have to say that is one of the best salads  I have been served at a restaurant.   Their blue cheese Filet Mignon is outright RICH. With a side of those garlic mashed potatoes, it will send you over the top. I can't see how nayone can finish it.  The keg is also great with reservations and will take them even if its just you and 1 other person. The wait here can get a bit long if you show up after 630. I always make reservations to be better safe than hungry.  Like another yelper mentioned, this is not a Ruth's Chris steak house, this is the Keg. A notch under the best, but for the price and the great food, you can't beat it.",

I ordered my usual, Filet cooked in medium  rare with twice baked potato, tender and juicy as always. The twice baked potato, on the other hand, was really salty this time, it usually tends to be salty, but this time was a bit over.

    "text": "Pricey, but the quality is there (depending on what you order). My personal go-to is the rib steak (medium-rare) with a side Caesar (salad not included, which is slightly annoying at the price point of the steak). I prefer my steak with a double portion of blue cheese topping (a mixture of, I presume, blue cheese, breadcrumbs, garlic, and horseradish). Try it! It is amazing. Oh you don't like horseradish? ME NEITHER! The flavor profile puts the horseradish exactly where it belongs: way in the back of the tasting notes and subtle enough that Catherine O'Hara would be halfway to Paris before she realized she'd forgotten it was there.   The bartenders go out of their way to remember your name, which really makes me feel welcome.   What I don't recommend: seafood. They were pushing their lobster when I was last in. Feeling adventurous, I opted for a sirloin/lobster tail combination and it was so below the standards I've come to expect from this place, that I almost didn't believe it came out of their kitchen. The sirloin was subpar (the rib steak is certainly a hard act to follow), but the lobster was an over cooked mess. Expensive and disappointing. That being said, this was the only time I was disappointed in The Keg.",

This past Saturday, my family and I went for my grandmother's birthday.  My water glass never got refilled, even after asking the waitress. My step mom had to ask three times for bread. The bread was finally brought to or table when we were almost finish with our meals even though she asked for it before she ordered an appetizer. The meal itself, was pretty bland.  At the end of the meal, an employee, I assumed a manager, came to our table to ask how the meal was. My grandmother explained the service and the food and the manager apologized, but seemed unphased by it. He pretty much apologized and walked away.  I'm sure this place only does well because of its convenient location. The food and service are both subpar.",

Then the dining manager stopped by and also said she was glad we had returned. She then let us know we were going to have dessert comped and give the VIP club price. The wait staff, manager and general manager made us feel like royality. The food? Very good as one would expect but the service is exemplary.",

We arrived at 4pm since they like eating early and that is when the restaurant opens.  We had a 20+ minute wait to be seated, even though there was only a few other customers. Then we were taken to a very small booth that was suitable for 2 people, not 4. When Mom asked about a bigger booth, she was told 'those are for other parties with more than 4'... it took having to be sort of nasty before we could sit in a booth with more room.  Food was ok, wait staff ok. Still don't understand making people wait to be seated with a close to empty restaurant. Probably won't be back - there's lots of other great steak places!",

We were escorted to a comfy booth in the back (My seat did have a noticeable large tear in it exactly where you would sit, minor point but you might want to get it reupholstered : ) ). I had the Thanksgiving meal, a three-course of Caesar salad, sliced turkey plate with mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, steamed vegetables, and a cheesecake with pumpkin spice drizzle. I also tried some lobster and the prime rib.   The Thanksgiving meal was decent, and admittedly their strong suit isn't poultry. The stuffing was a bit mushy, the turkey was tender, but not really inspiring any \"wow\" factor. I did like the cranberry sauce since it wasn't overloaded with sugar like the stuff in the Ocean Spray can is. The mashed potatoes and veggies were very basic, nothing too awe inspiring.  The steak and seafood were a lot better. The prime rib had good flavor, and was a good portion for the price. It's no Durant's prime rib in terms of tenderness, but then again you aren't paying Durant's prices :). The lobster I had was delicious, full of flavor, cooked just right. The cheesecake was pretty basic, and the crust tasted more like sugar than graham cracker.  Service was great and a manager even stopped by each table to make sure everyone was having a good experience here.   Overall, it's a good option if you're in Tempe and want steak or seafood.",

Tuna tartare appetizer is almost too big, with very good tuna and plenty of avocado. Both steak were good and cooked to perfection.

A big group of us celebrated our friends' engagement at The Keg.  Two servers handled 16 people in spectacular fashion.  Drinks were flowing, food was always on the table, no orders were screwed up (quite rear with a group this size), and they even separated the checks by couple without a fuss, and the Keg did not automatically add a gratuity to the check (while I understand the practice, I prefer a server actually work for their tip).

The twice baked potato is beyond amazing and the stake are perfectly cooked and seasoned.   The reason it took the place of my go to stake house is because they actually server their wine at the correct temperature unlike Village Tavern. The two food wise are very comparable and both excellent but The Keg stores and serves their win at the correct temperature and has a good section.",

    "text": "Service was wonderful, as was the atmosphere, but I found the food lacking...  We showed up and were seated immediately. Our group was waiting for another individual, so we looked through the drink menu (Coors Light on tap as a featured beer, seriously? WTF) and ordered our drinks while we waited. I ordered a Mojito and was expecting greatness, but was SO disappointed. The drink was super bland, no sweetness or mint flavor. Sad way to start out the evening.  Our fourth guest arrived and we ordered our appetizers (Calamari and Escargot) and ordered a bottle of wine for our meal. The Wine list was disappointing, but the wine we chose ended up being suitable. The Calamari was alright, not as crispy as I would have liked, but a nice flavor. The Escargot was also decent, but the flavor was a bit off.   I had ordered Prime Rib with a Twice Baked Potato and shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese with a friend. The Prime Rib was very tasty, but also super fatty and didn't have a nice char on the outter edge - which happens to be my favorite part of the prime rib. The Twice Baked Potato was alright, but nothing special. The Truffled Mac & Cheese was made with truffle oil and was actually very delicious... I wish I could have eaten more of that!  For dessert, we shared a Brownie Sundae and the brownie was glorious! I wish the ice cream could have matched it, but no worries... delicious brownie ftw.  The atmosphere was great, as was the service.   All and all, the experience wasn't horrible and I would likely be back and order a steak and some mac & cheese with no drinks from the bar.",

    "text": "Took a friend to dinner here this past Tuesday.  It was his first visit at any Keg; I've only dined at the Chandler location.  I enjoyed our dinner and conversation, even though we elected to stay at the bar when we could've had our pick of tables and booths.  I had received an invite to enjoy dinner for two for $30 (choice of prime rib and sirloin, plus potato and veggies), but when we learned that we could opt to apply the savings (a $15.90 value) towards other selections, we decided to go w/ the server's suggestions of filet mignon w/ blue cheese mousse ($24.95; for me) and sirloin topped w/ roasted red pepper cream sauce and garnished w/ grilled asparagus, lobster, and scallops ($26.95; for him), both cooked to medium.  We were promptly served The Keg's awesome complimentary table bread and butter.  Love it!  After about a 20-minute wait, our entrees arrived, and boy, were they beautiful!  I wished I had taken photos!  (I promise to next time.)  While I loved my garlic-studded blue cheese mousse-topped bacon-wrapped filet mignon (Whew!  Try saying that fast three times!), w/ sweet potato fries instead of the standard loaded double-baked potato, it was my friend's roasted red pepper cream sauced sirloin that stole the show!  Apparently my friend enjoyed his meal, since the only things that remained on his plate were the potato skin and a couple pieces of soggy sweet potato fries (the kitchen made a mistake and switched our potato selections).  I will definitely order this dish again, and it'll have to be soon as the entree isn't even on the regular dining menu- it's a seasonal offering.    I really wanted to have a glass of wine, but decided against it as I had a long drive home to look forward to; However, it was a pleasant surprise to find out that The Keg offered Blue Moon on tap, and it was w/ pleasure to savor the few sips off of my friend's pilsner glass.  The Keg now offers happy hours, but only on drinks- no food specials :(",

I was given an option of the dining room or lounge which ironically is why I was at their restaurant.  I was not offered such in one of their competitors restaurants just shortly before.  I'm glad I decided to walk out of that place and come to The Keg.  The food was phenomenal and the service even better!  I had the Prime Rib.  Everything from the Wedge salad, dinner bread, entree and sides were nothing short of awesome!    The service was so incredible that I tipped the server 50% of the check.  Thank you The Keg ... I'll be back soon !",

The restaurant was equally as busy. We were seated quickly. Our service was so so. Our waiter was overwhelmed.  Others filled our drinks and we never did get the other loaf of bread we asked for. The food was amazing. I had the mushroom stuffed chicken. Everyone else had the prime rib. We loved it all. The Brussel sprouts were a little tough, though. I prefer them softer. Overall, I would recommend this place.",

Yes very pricey for a student budget, but we made it! I had one of their meat sandwiches. The meat is the target! it came with broth on a side and I had the garlic mashed potatoes.

We got a filet, sirloin, crab cake, calamari and Caesar salad. The sides to our steaks were good, but the steaks sucked.

As we walked in we were greeted by very friendly staff members, and were seated right away. It was nice to be at a restaurant to where you receive service as soon as you are seated. We were able to order a few drinks and an appetizer as we looked over our menu. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, and even suggested a few options since we were new to the restaurant. Our food came out pretty quick, and was cooked to perfection. Not only was the steak I ordered cooked to my liking, it was juicy and full of flavor. On top of my potato side dish I also received a few veggies. I am not a huge veggie person, but the asparagus and the grilled peppers were a perfect combination with my steak. Pricing wise The Keg isn't too expensive, but it's higher up there. If you are looking for a great steakhouse and are willing to pay a little extra for flavor and a nice setting, this place is definitely worth trying.  I will be going back very soon!",

    "text": "I've never left a bad review before but I was extremely disappointed in my experience in the bar of The Keg in Tempe Wednesday night. While I must say our server was fantastic, everything else was blah.   I met some friends for drinks and appetizers. The first drink I had was the Orange Slice. I've had this in the past at a different Keg location and enjoyed it. But this time, I thought I could taste the chlorinated Phoenix water in the drink. I didn't say anything to our server but I decided to order a different drink the next round. My second drink was an Old Fashioned. This drink is made with bourbon, bitters, lemon, orange, sugar and soda. So I couldn't understand why it tasted extremely watered down. This time I said something to the server. I thought it might be the soda water that had ruined these drinks. She checked with the manager and then returned recommending I avoid a drink made with soda. The manager did not stop by. I sent the drink back and ordered a Manhattan. The Manhattan is described on the menu as being made with bourbon, vermouth, and \"house-made drunken Bing cherries\". Cherries. Plural. The drink arrived with a single MARASCHINO cherry. Not the house-made cherries I was expecting and looking forward to. This drink also tasted watered down, as if it sat in the mixer cup over ice much too long. My friend ordered a spiked tea. It, too, was extremely watered down! I blame the bartender for our disappointing experience. One of my friends had a steak and was quite pleased with her meal. In the future, IF I ever do return to this restaurant, I will only choose wine or beer because the bartender either does not know how to make cocktails, or she was skimping on listed ingredients to save the restaurant money.",

    "text": "Update 7/3/2015: In celebration of one year at my job here in Tempe I went with a friend to The Keg.. We don't go to The Keg too often but when we do we are never, ever disappointed.  Shrimp Cocktail, Lobster Tail, Top Sirloin cooked to perfection .. omgoodness I was in heaven. My favorite steak house now.. absolutely must try. IN addition I forgot my reading glasses at home and they brought me a pair to use so this far-sighted old lady could see the menu. Above and beyond I tell you. Definitely a great place to eat and relax.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm new to Tempe, AZ and a friend and I were looking for a steakhouse last night. We found The Keg on Yelp and it had some excellent ratings so we gave it a try. I have to say it is the best experience I've had at a restaurant in a long, long time. IF you are a mushroom fiend you must try Mushrooms Neptune - I couldn't get enough of the crab and cream cheese concoction that enveloped those dainty little mushroom caps. Yes, I used my bread to get every last bit. My friend was teasing me everything tasted good thanks to the appletini I'd consumed (which was perfect).. but no this is so not True. Our server was terrific and highly attentive without being too invasive. We both had steaks and lobster and crab legs - everything was fantastic. I even ordered dessert because everything had tasted so good! (I have half a slice of cheesecake sitting in my fridge for further indulgence tonight!) The creme brulee was so delicious (I stuck my fork in my friends brulee - they didn't mind).  The Keg is now on my list of places to take friends and family when they come to visit. 5 stars across the board.. loved the feel of the place too. Tshirt and jeans are ok (you won't get turned away) but I found people were wearing business casual. Even the kids in the restaurant were well-behaved haha :D   It is a little pricey but really not much more than Outback - and we like this place more - all they need is a blooming onion and we will never go back to Outback :D",

The vegetables that came with it were terrible, they were undercooked and dry .

Since moving to Phoenix I have had sub-par service at almost every restaurant I have visited. To the point where I haven't bothered going out much because it just doesn't seem worth it. The Keg completely changed things around for me. Hands down best service I've gotten since moving to Phoenix. My co-worker and I did not spend a lot of money on this outing and we were still treated like royalty. Waitress was so friendly and welcoming. Checked in on us many times and never let our water glasses get more than half empty. Must have had my glass filled 5 times. The food and drink came at the right time. First we ordered mojitos for $6 off the happy hour menu and then we ordered nachos. So in total we probably spent about $20 but you would never know that by the way we were treated. We never felt rushed or pressured to spend money. So you know what, the next time I do feel like spending money and having a real nice dinner I will absolutely go here. I know they treat their customers well no matter what. The ambiance here is lovely for a date night or night out. The patio is great- love dining outdoors! Drinks were generously sized, quite strong, and of course delicious. Can't wait to return. Finally some good service in Phoenix!!",

Their treat!! Dylan was our server. Pleasant and not over the top. Carlos, the manager introduced himself. We were given a Happy Anniversary card as soon as we were seated. What a nice touch. Ordered 4 of the appetizers. Enjoyed most of them. Nothing due to quality, just preference. Now the dinner: 3 of us ordered steaks, and one steak salad. All of us agreed that dinner was DELISH! Steaks cooked exactly as requested. Seasoned perfectly. I picked Asiago rice as my side, even though I assumed it would just be ok. I was wrong. That rice was so tasty. I couldn't decide if I liked the steak or the rice best. Everyone polished their dishes! We didn't plan on dessert, but glad we did that too. Brownie sundaes, carrot cake, and creme brulee. To top the evening, we were surprised with complementary champagne. How lovely.  Great night. YUMMY! I'm not sure what would make it a 5...but it's close!",

    "text": "The Keg is a very upscale restaurant that definitely exemplifies fine dining.  The wait staff is very attentive and the menu has a lot of appealing dishes on it.  I ordered the 12 oz prime rib with the twice baked potato, at the waiter's recommendation.  The prime rib probably wasn't my best match since it was a little too fatty for my liking and had a very natural flavor to it, while I think I would have preferred something a little more seasoned.  The fried onions on top were delicious though and gave it a nice complement.  Also I probably could have gone with the 10 oz, it was a lot of food!  The twice baked potato was amaaaaazing, at least in the few bites I could manage to sneak in while working on the meat.  The baseball steak and dungeness crab cluster also tasted delicious (someone else at my table ordered that).  The baseball steak had great flavoring on it, and was what made me realize that mine was a little bland for my liking.  Really great food overall, and definitely a great \"special occasion\" restaurant to go to.",

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated.  Our server was Montana and she was great.  She was really friendly but also knew when to leave us alone and enjoy our meal.  We had a nice private table, which was perfect.  A caesar salad sounded great to start but I really didn't want to ruin my meal.  She offered to split the salad between us.  Again, perfect.  And it was one of the better caesar salads I've had.  We were also happy to see that one of our favorite wines was on the extensive wine list.  When dinner came, it looked fabulous.  I ordered the filet with cajun shrimp and garlic mashed potatoes.  The hubs went with the steak oscar.  So SO delicious! We will definitely be back and this might be our new birthday spot!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place better because the concept is good: upscale ambiance, attentive service and steak oriented menu but I just couldn't get over the fact that my steak was mediocre at best.  Maybe it was just that particular NY Strip cut, because the prime rib in the sirloin steak the other members of my party had were a bit better.  The steakhouse fries were just out fridge and the bread was very dry and brought to us without butter. The garlic mashed potatoes were good but the company and vegetables were rather dry and unseasoned. The iceberg wedge salad was very good although maybe a few too many tomatoes.  Overall I was hoping for something better and think I could've either gotten Outback on the casual side, or just taken the next step and then Ruth's Chris and got something superior.",

Chefs aren't busy, they take time with your food and it usually comes out much faster.  Well not at the Keg. There were all of 4 people in the restaurant and it still took 50 Minutes to get food on the table. Little did I realize that the reason it took this long was because they were taking extra time to cook out any flavor or moisture.  My sons burger was so dry and over cooked, it crunched. It CRUNCHED. Like... the hamburger patty, guys.  I ordered crispy fried chicken and got chicken strips that were bone dry and had NO taste to them. I wish I were exaggerating. I mean, I'm an adult at a semi-decent restaurant. I'm not trying to order chicken strips.  One of the \"strips\" was a bone covered in batter and fried. I have photographic evidence of this. Lol The slaw was basically undressed cabbage and corn. It was actually dry. My brain literally cannot compute what was happening on that plate.  My daughter had chicken strips and they were so over cooked she couldn't even bite into them. Fries were good, but how does one screw up French fries? Husband got the \"special\" which was sirloin (which was cooked right but not seasoned) and it also had scallops and a single shrimp. All the seafood was severely over cooked.  Now, I'm a nice person and I very RARELY get this heated over a bad meal, but the staff didn't even question if our meal was okay as they removed completely untouched plates of food and handed us a $120 bill. Not even a blink.  I don't know who you all have running this place but quality is at a low Ive literally never experienced. What's worse was walking out to all the happy people with balloons exiting Red Robbin next door. Lol! That sucked because we ALMOST went there. Ahhh so close.  Anyways, we are picking up crummy fast food and heading home so we can eat something before dark....Lord have mercy.",

Sat in the bar area and the service was great even though it was the last hour they were open and the girl was trying to get closing stuff done. The food was tasty and timely and that visit would've gotten a 5star review.  However...I got a take out order tonight because my daughter wanted steak and I was in the area already, so I decided to come back since the food was great.  I made sure that we had the amount of containers as food ordered but I did not think to open each container to make sure everything was in it.  I finally make it home and get to my entree and notice that something was missing. The classic dinners are supposed to come with sauteed mushrooms and mine were not there. I called the restaurant to tell them, granted they are closed, and spoke to Carlos.  He did apologize but said there was nothing they could do because they are closed and it must have just been an oversight.  So nice knowing that just because you order and pay for something doesn't mean that you'll actually get all that is supposed to be there. Knowing that this happened and they don't care makes me not want to go back to any Keg restaurant.  This experience became a 1 star very fast...so both combined get just 3.  There are lots of other places that actually care that their guests get what they ordered.",

    "text": "I went here last night for happy hour / dinner and my opinion of this place is slipping.  Their happy hour drink menu got a lot smaller.  Plus, there are no well drink specials to be found.  Also, the bar area is just too busy for 1-2 waitresses.  It gets frustrating when you have to wait too long for a drink or ask several times for more of those awesome chips.  We probably would have stayed longer and spent more money if it wasn't such a pain to order more stuff.  Anyway, we had a few drinks and some appetizers.  All the appetizers are excellent.  Last time I went I told myself I wanted to try their filet.  So this time I did and it was just ok.  It wasn't worth $25 and why they wrap it in bacon I will never know.  However, it was cooked properly and was tender and pretty flavorful.  I also had their wedge salad was was excellent.",

The decor is modern and sleek. The wait staff were on top of things and extremely knowledgeable of the menu and recommendations and the food spoke for itself.   I had a blue cheese wedge salad and the NY strip with the blue cheese spread and the three mushroom mixture. Cooked perfect to my request, the blue cheese and mushrooms were a great add, via the waiter and the salad was prepared in the classic manner.   Great experience especially with a group of 16 people!",

We arrived at 7pm without reservations (they say they only accept \"call aheads\"), and were asked to wait in the bar area until they had a table available.  We waited approx. 10 minutes at the bar, but had a nice time and good cocktails.  Interestingly, after we were seated, my family and I all commented on the fact that there were at least 10 open, clean tables in the restaurant.  Funny, right?  Our server, Dominic, provided us with some of the best service I've ever received anywhere.  Next time you visit The Keg at Tempe Marketplace, ask for him.  I know I will.  My wife and I started with a house salad, which they split for us - a nice touch, along with the bacon-wrapped scallops and sweet hot calamari, which the table shared.  It was all delicious, prepared just right.  For our entrees, my wife had the grilled top sirloin, while I had the prime rib.  Both were amazing, prepared just as we requested!  During the meal, my wife and I each had a glass of the Pazzo Sangiovese/Cabernet blend.  We both thought it was outstanding - featuring the best attributes of each varietal.",

As she was playing with it while we were waiting for our food, the manager comes up to our table and asks us to have our daughter stop playing with her toy because it was making noise.  Keep in mind, the restaurant was empty and not many customers.  It was a Monday night for crying out loud. This has turned me off to The Keg and they have a lost a valued customer based on the manager's lack of tact.  Every year for Spring Training, I will now have to look for other options.",

We ordered cheesecake and Miners pie that delivered a chocolate punch. Both desserts were smooth and more than enough to share. A wonderful place to enjoy  again!!",

Brought a bottle of wine, assuming they can provide corkage.  General Manager, Bobby Price, very tactfully explained to me that wasn't an option, due to liquor license specs, which is surprising, but fine with me.  They stored my wine bottle in their temperature controlled wine cooler. Enjoyed an excellent steak dinner, with wonderful wines available on their list.  Prime rib for me, filet mignon (plus some tasty bernaise sauce) for the wife, and the sliders for my 8 yo daughter.  I tried the sliders, and initially thought it was steak, since the meat was very high quality.  Amy, our server, was excellent and attentive, but not intrusive at all.  Ended up going the full nine yards, including a complementary app (bacon wrapped scallops), all the way to a decadent brownie sundae, enjoyed with some cordials (glenmorangie for me, and a generous glass of tawny port for my wife).  When in AZ, we'll definitely plan to come back here, mainly for the excellent service at all levels, along with some of the best steakhouse-style food we've had.",

My coworkers shared a rack of Pork Ribs and enjoyed them.  Feeling in the cow mood, I really liked the filet medallions with 3 different sauces (creamy peppercorn, Chimichurri, and Bearnaise) and they served the sauces on the side :)  We were all full and had no room for dessert, although the creme brulee sounded awesome.

The manager stopped by just to make sure we enjoyed our service and meals. Their overall service is definitely top notch and as good as Durant's.

Since this restaurant is known for their steaks, I ordered a 10oz prime rib (medium rare) with twice baked potatoes as my side. Their prime rib is tender but a bit dry. Overall I still like it. Their twice baked potatoes is absolutely delicious. If I wasn't so full, I would have finished the whole thing.   Overall, I think this restaurant is wonderful.

We started with their own sour dough baked bread which was tasty and then a ceasar salad which was very fresh and tossed in some sort of delicious dressing.   I forgot to ask what that was, lol.  The turkey dinner itself was amazing! No dry chewy turkey here! It was moist, melt in your mouth and seasoned to perfection.  Our waitress Claire was not only beautiful! But also very attentive and professional!  I love this place! You will not be disappointed, the staff are amazing... Enjoy!",

    "text": "I would LOVE to rate them 5 stars, but can't because of the way they handled my food allergy (see below note).   Service: if I could give 100 stars here for service from our waiter, I would. I'm a stickler for service and John B. was seriously AMAZING. I can't remember the last time I have had such amazing service.   Food: Amazing. - had cesar and wedge salads (both $7)..both crisp and delicious.. 10oz prime rib ($25), twice baked potato (yesss!) and then the special- t-bone ($36) forget the oz ... added 1/2lb of king crab for $18 with mashed potatoes... A++  Drinks: Enjoyed the Celery Southside  (Hendrick's gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, muddled celery) - yummy!   My issue here was that I have a food allergy and specifically made sure to tell them that an ALLERGY  was the reason I was ordering gluten free (not just a diet) and that I could not have onion rings on my plate. Our food arrived and low and behold... Onion rings (crispies, whatever they're called) on my plate, including under my mest. John did not deliver our food but came over a minute later and immediately saw them, apologized and took it back to the kitchen. A few minutes later, a manager dropped off my food and let me know that they had changed out my plate and put my *rare* piece of prime rib on the grill for a minute (I guess to \"kill\" the wheat that had contaminated it??).... First of all, when dealing with an allergy, that isn't the way to handle it - we put your meat on the grill so that it would break down the gluten... FYI gluten isn't broken down on a grill/fryer/etc. so that did nothing but I guess I can appreciate the effort.. Maybe? Also, that obviously turned my rare piece of meat into a medium (honestly maybe on the well-done side) piece of meat so it wasn't edible to me since I don't like to eat anything cooked more than medium-well. John, once again, apologized and could see there was zero pink so I was then served a delicious rare piece of prime rib.",

Very good wine list and cocktail menu, which we utilized. There is a choice 1oz or 2oz on cocktails and a large wine. My wife and i both ordered the large offering, The server brought out  hot sourdough bread and butter, which was very good, I ordered the prime rib and my wife a cauliflower steak with asparagus, My prime rib was a perfect rare, with twice baked potato and slivers of fried onions. The server delivered it on a piping hot plate, which i loved with a boat of Au jus and fresh creamy horseradish. The prime rib was perfectly seasoned and cooked. My wife tried her meal on the recommendations of the server, and she loved it. Overall enjoyed all aspects of the evening, and price wise was reasonable. We will definitely return when we come to see our son or ASU football.",

Our server Josh was great and the restaurant managers stopped by our table to check in at least twice.  You have to love a manager who works the floor with his employees.   The food was ok, nothing special. It seems that the service from the hostess end could have been better, they didn't seem to be too engaged. We were sat in a location with a lot of foot traffic when the rest of the restaurant was fairly slow.  In their defense we didn't asked to be moved.   Idk what it is but this Keg experience was lagging to others.  I would come back for Happy Hour, maybe not for dinner.",

My wife had to mustard salmon. Never had anything like this. Very tasty salmon with a touch of a mustard taste. Mustard wasn't overpowering at all. Very good. Our kids had the steak and half lobster. They gobbled it up. So our dinner was very good.   For desert we had passion brulee. It was such a small little cup. Come on. You can make it bigger. Also had the Billy Minor ice cream cake. So good.   The service was exceptional. They filled our water cups and continually asked about our meal. Even the manager stopped by. Very nice. Overall, we had a very enjoyable meal.",

    "text": "First of all, if I could give this place zero starts I would. It's not because it wasn't a nice restaurant because the inside was very nice. It's purely because of terrible customer services that was displayed there to me and my friend. I'll explain...  Yesterday 8/30/17 evening around 6:30 pm my friend and I went to this restaurant based off a recommendation from a colleagues. As we walk in, there were two hostess standing up  front.  They greeted us very nicely at first. We were given the option to go to the bar area where there was opening seating or the dinning area. We requested the dinning area. The hostess said it would be about a 15-20 min wait. My friend and I were ok with the wait as we were anticipating the food here. We take our number and sit down and waited.   During our time there were other customers coming in who mentioned they had reservations  and they were taken to the back. But then a family comes in of about 6 people. They are standing in front of my friend and l so clearly we can hear their convo. I over heard them talking about how they didn't have reservations and they wonder how long the wait was going to be. At this point my friend and I have already been waiting 15 mins. That same family was greeted by a server who came out from the dinning hall. The server then began to give each person a hug and a Kiss.  A gentleman a part of this group said \" how long is the wait \" the sever clearly states \" I have one more table. Once they leave I will hook you guys up, I will bring you back.\" So at this point my friend and I look at each other  and was thinking I hope they don't bring this party of 6 back before our party of 2. We heard them clearly state they didn't have reservation and and the server said he would hook them up. Also thought how unprofessional it If for a server to have this convo in the entrance of the restaurant where others can hear.   At this point it's been. 25 mins my friend and I have been  waiting. The party of 6 goes to the bar all of ten mins or less and the hostess who originally told us it would be 15-20 Waite took that party of six back the dinning area. As she was taking them back she looked back at us and quickly turned her head away.   Now we are going on 30 -35 mins. I get up to front desk and ask them how long the wait was she said another 4 more mins. I said \"ok no worries, we see other parties come up up before us so I was just wondering.\"  She said \" ohh ok they all had reservations. At this point she has lied to my face because my friend and I clearly heard the family state they didn't have any reservations. So some had reservations not ALL.   We agreed that If they don't get to us in 5-10 Minutes we will leave. Another 10 min went by and we still didn't get called. We decided it was time to go. I went up to gave my number back and the hostess was like \" There is open seating up here.\" I stated to them nicely \" no thank you we see other getting seated before us with no reservations and we have been waiting 45 mins.\" The hostess grabbed my number from me,  rolled her eyes at me and looked away. RUDE!!   What they didn't know is my friend and I were testing the restaurant out to see if it would be a great fit to house and high end company dinner. We picked the dinning area on purpose because we wanted to see if this place would be a perfect fit. However due to the poor customer service, the unprofessionalism of the employees and the rudeness of the hostess we will NOT be taking our business there. They lost out on a lot of money that could have been spent there. We will be taking our business else where.",

It was above average for sangrias in Phoenix.  We both started off with caesar salads and they were very good.  We ordered the baked garlic shrimp appetizer.  It was heavenly.  The shrimp itself was okay but the whole flavor and the cheese was very good.  We were like \"Wow!  How much better can it get?\"  Then came our main dishes.  Mushroom and onion manhattan steak (cooked medium) and sirloin oscar steak.  It was good but didn't taste right.  I assumed it was some kind of weird seasoning but it turns out later, as I found out to be something else.  The atmosphere was nice.  The shrimp and scallops on the oscar were decent.  Obviously, you are not going to get good seafood in Phoenix.  Then came the check. They charged us $30 + $10 for the sirloin oscar.  The menu said $30 for the sirlion oscar.  The waitress herself was not all that friendly.  A little standoffish but helpful.    The whole experience was a nice treat.  I would have given it 5 stars if we both didn't experience food poisoning after eating there.  There's definitely something wrong with the food since we both had an upset stomach.  Anyways, we went home and after about 2 hours decided to take an herbal anti-biotic.    At first my date said she looked forward to coming back to The Keg and so did I, but later during the night after the upset stomach, she said she wasn't sure she ever wanted to eat there again.  We decided to throw away the leftover steak we took home.  The food poisoning was evident the next day.",

When our meal came out there was this odor coming from the 2 plates.  The prosciutto wrapped shrimp had a very strange odor.  It smelled like WET DOG! BAD! to the point that we didn't want to smell it anymore, and it kept wafting towards us.  At the end of the meal we had the shrimp set aside, 2 tried the shrimp, NASTY, it tasted like it smelled.  We informed Megan and she went and got the manager, she agreed with us that it smelled gross.  JOSH the manager came over and said \"I expected this, I thought it smelled funny!\"  My husband asked him \"why did you let this come out to our table if you noticed the smell?\"   Josh was a douche about the whole thing.  He took off both meals, still he did not own up to his \"management\" mistake, Megan you were very nice and a great server so thank you, JOSH get your head out of your ass and do you job.

    "text": "I dont eat steak but figured there are other options for me to try at this place. We went on a Wednesday night and it was pretty packed.   The ambience has a Nice rustic feel to it. I loved how there are no televisions around except at the bar. The service is pretty quick.   I tried their Calamari for appetizer and it was pretty good with jalapeno. I ordered keg sized lobster for entree and man that was a huge portion. I had my hopes so high only to realize it was undercooked and way too salty. I was really unhappy with it and wished I ordered something else. It costed $41 for a not so happy meal.  Their creme Brulee is to die for, the sugar coating was over burnt which I can forgive, coz the custard was very good. Their pie is great too, the Oreo base they have is delicious.   I would have gone with a 4 star but the entree really threw me off. Overall a good place but wouldn't go for the lobster next time. The place is definitely on the expensive side and would suggest to save this place for good occasions.",

We made the reservation on OpenTable and when we showed up, waited maybe 2min before being seated.  We were helped right away with drinks and our server talke about the specials they had.  We all ordered salads and steaks.  With the recent ecoli outbreak, they were able to echange the romain lettuce for mixed greens and their caesar salad was still great.  I had the lettuce wedge with was really good.  Two of us ordered their 20oz Rib Steak with sauteed mushrooms and asparagas.  It was probably one of the most delicious steaks I have ever had.  I've been to The Keg before but I don't remember it being this great.  It was so good, that I polished off the entire thing without hating myself.  I seriously wanted more.  It wasn't until I was done eating when the server came over to check on things and I asked \"What's Chicago style for the steaks?\"  Eplaining that it's seared with butter, I about fell over. I knew next time, I would be enjoying my steak just like that.  Service, food, atmosphere at this place was just wonderful and I can't wait to go back!",

The kitchen forgot the mushrooms on my plate but as soon as I they were aware of it, it was corrected. The staff was great. Our server was very careful to make sure we got everything just the way we wanted it. My partner ordered the peppercorn stake. He was very please as well with is dinner. My only complaint is I was craving peanut butter pie, and it wasn't on the menu.  But I guess I can't really complain about something that I'm craving.",

Once they got there, my son ordered the Prime Rib. Imagine his disappointment (and my anger and disgust), that he was served a slice that was a fatty piece of crap with only a handful of edible bites. They would not take it back, and he spent $97.00 there. The Keg took advantage of a teenager and they ruined his Prom dining experience. Steer clear of this restaurant!",

    "text": "We sat down at our table for at least 10 minutes before anyone noticed us. Payton came over to grab her tip off the table said, Hi. I remember you. Then no one for another 15 minutes.  Around 6:30 our sever Kristen stated she was new. We ordered two red wines off the happy hour. One glass of wine craft shows up ran  by a (not our) server who brought it to the table, didn't bring a glass at all. She runs back to the bar grabs a glass, pours it walks away. My husband stated that he also ordered a glass as we did. That server stated she couldn't help us. Seriously, She couldn't put a glass wine in under her name and our table? OR at best call it back to the bar?    Kristen stated she was new again-which is understandable- I was most disappointed about her support system if she was new. I watch others help each other clean each other's tables, greeted others table. Not Kristen's why is this? The Keg is to be teamwork environment, yet the new girl is thrown to the wolves? We ordered right after 7, our apps never arrived yet the children's plates arrived. Salads hit the table- the male manager brought us the salads; then asked us if we needed anything. My husband stated silverware he brought us silverware- never saw him again.  Then entrees hit the table, the manager brought (during salad course) us only two roll ups for our meals not our three children's. I ordered the prime rib but no steak knife to cut my prime ribeye with? No one came back for our check back, finally our server came back. She states how sorry she was, we explained to her that we were missing our app and my daughter's meal.  We finished eating, my daughter's meal arrived. Its fried chicken tenders- how in world did it take ten minutes? These errors come from failure around the server, she didn't have the proper help. She stated she had 9 tables at 6:30. Nine tables for someone who is new? That's insane! How is she able to think properly, get my order correct, and get refills? Which we were never asked for our children.  The manager did not even come back to say bye to us. He was at the host stand. I also saw a female manager walking around the bar yet she didn't stop by. Yet she stopped at the table next to us?  We have eaten here, had an amazing time for our son's 5th birthday in January. Payton was our server that evening. She was amazing. She even remembered us tonight. I am just deeply disappointed by our service this evening.   I think your company needs to re-train your management on touching tables before leaving or at least saying bye to my family as we leave along with the host staff. They should be able to say goodbye to each guest as they leave. Both my husband and I work in the industry-my husband has worked as a chef for 30 years, from Ruth's Chris to Morton's we come to your steak house because your food quality is good. After tonight we begin to doubt our choice for our family's dinner, food was good but your service standards were lacking.",

The restaurant was not crowded, that should have been our first clue.  After waiting a long tome for our food there were a few missing items, one of which was the only thing one of our party was eating. After apologies by the Manager I told him we had a birthday, to which he said, \"I will make sure she's taken care of.\"  Nothing after a long wait as he flirted with his staff.  While we waited for the ticket a dessert  arrived per the waitress  as the staff and manager continued flirting  and didn't even notice.  The ticket arrived in a rude manner and with no apologies.      The food was nothing to brag about and when paying $30 for prime rib you should want to take home the leftovers but we didn't.

I will keep this short.  Service was average at best and quite slow.  My main concern was the prime rib, which the waiter touted as their flagship meat.  My wife and I shared the large cut based on our servers suggestion.  Our friends did the same.  We aren't sure how to ruin prime rib, but the Keg does.   The meat was tough and you needed the steak knife to saw through it.  And it appears our cuts missed out on that famous seasoning process the waiter bragged about because the prime was almost tasteless.  I used to really enjoy The Keg....but something has changed.  Better prime at Lone Star.",

The service is very nice, attentive and courteous. This is a very valued feature and they should take credit for this. Also, the wait staff looks great in a very tidy and appropriate fashion. The service is where this place wins me over.   The Happy Hour food is price worthy - for a happy hour munch to side with your beverage it is very decent. The Happy Hour drinks include a Orange slice martini, yes it might not be the manliest of beverages.. but it is tasty, for sure. besides that they have some interesting beer as well.   For our big group, this was a nice venue. The establishment had set aside a portion in the corner and that was perfect. We had great service, and at the same time we were left to our own devices and not hovered upon. Overall, a nice experience... did I mention the service?",

I ordered the top sirloin, medium rare. On the side I wanted mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, raw bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and raw onion circles. Got mashed potatoes with green onions inside it, cooked green peas and sweet peppers. And a plate of roasted onions. Order customization failed. The steak was well done (may be I should've gone for rare?) so I didn't enjoy it either. Wait time is above normal, I'd say. They don't have Pumpernickel, they don't know what it is. The interior is ... okay. Comparing to the finest Chicago steak houses I've been to this place is 2.5 stars, but not 3. So it's 2.",

Also got the scallops and shrimp. Eh nothing special I've had much better. I have never gone out to eat and still been hungry after. I ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was good. No complaints but it's comparable to any store bought one. Husband got sirloin steak he liked it but didn't care for the veggies he said they looked freezer burned. He also got the lobster tail. Nothing worse than crispy lobster.  He did enjoy his brownie dessert. But the entree did not fill him up either. For the money you can go somewhere that serves better food. Sorry for the bad review but step it up a notch you're a high dollar place so please cook and serve accordingly. No frozen foods please.",

Don't get me wrong, I don't need pomp and circumstance, but when the kid at In N Out is more professional, then Houston we got a problem.  Secondly for some crazy reason, the booth behind ours had about 25 outdoor seat cushions stacked up. I know they are for outside, and need to go somewhere, but this is Saturday night at 7. Put them AWAY. They spent thousands of dollars on ambiance, only to ruin it with a stack of cushions? Weird.  Ok KEG, those are some issues that need work. The food was good as usual, but it's not enough to carry a sketchy service otherwise. Ironically we chose KEG over Durant's which in retrospect- was a grave error.",

Walking in we were told the wait for an indoor table was 15-20min but the bar and outdoor areas are free seating. We chose outside and they even had a smoking area. Service was great and since we were the first guest to sit outside, the turned on the misters and promptly came back to take our order. And the food was awsome. Being a professional cook I was impressed by this steak house that can ACTUALLY prepare a steak to MY order. I got the New York Stip and she had the prime rib. The prime rib was the Shizzle for rizzle. They even had a great local beer selection along with the domestics.  It does get a little pricey but the atmosphere is great, food is better, and they even have Escargo (not bad for snails lol).  Definitely bringing her back here. And its a great place to start a bar-hopping plan.",

The wait staff are very courteous and knowledgeable and each time we've been here the manager has come by to check on the service.   Oh, and if you like mixed drinks, they serve a nice Tanqueray and Tonic, with the Tanq delivered in a glass with ice and line while the tonic is served in a separate mini-carafe so you get fresh bubbles in your drink.   This is definitely going to become one of my musts anytime I come to AZ.",

It all started when we walked in and sat at the bar. We waited for almost 10 min for a drink. It wasn't busy at the bar. They just were more interested in chatting that serving customers. This is my second try at this location. Both times an over cooked steak. I ordered MR and received a steak that was MW. I understand that the kitchen makes mistakes. Although I told the bar tender that the last time I was here they over cooked my steak. Don't over cook my steak! Of course they did. The manager delivered my steak. Didn't have any interest in hearing what I had to say. Didn't offer any discount. Just said this rarely happens. I must say the second steak was done to perfection. I have come to expect a high level of quality and service when I'm paying $50. For a meal. I have had better steaks at outback. Save your money or go to Stockyards.",

The table next to us mentioned to their waiter that their steak was overdone. He immediately whisked it away, with lots of apologies, and promptly brought out a replacement. The manager soon came out to apologize and made sure the replacement was satisfactory. He then offered them a free dessert of their choice.   To our surprise, our waiter brought out a complementary piece of mocha almond ice cream pie and congratulated us on our anniversary. We were sold.

The decor is nice, and I like the option to sit indoors or out. We opted to sit in the bar, and got a nice comfy booth.  Our waitress was fantastic. I am not a huge steak fan, and made a decision on what to order pretty quick, but my friend had a ton of questions about the menu.(Yes, she is one of those annoying orderers)  The waitress was very patient and friendly and gave some great recommendations. The manager also checked on us throughout our meal which is always a nice touch.  For my meal, I started with the french onion soup, which was amazing. Sometimes I find french onion to be too salty, but the one at the Keg was made just right. For a main entree i went with the mustard salmon and garlic mashed potatoes. The salmon was excellent and the potatoes were tasty as well.  My friend ended up going with the the homerun steak, or maybe it was called the pitch. (Something to do with baseball but I do not quite remember.) The steak came out and we were both surprised. It was huge. My friend loved it though, and said it was cooked just right.   We were both stuffed about halfway through our meals, so we opted to not do dessert.   Overall, I really liked this restaurant. I found the prices to be really good for a Steakhouse as well. Service was excellent and food was yummy. I would return.",

Drinks were well-made (how could you mess up a Grey Goose and Diet Coke?) as well as the apps (nachos and bruschetta). I didn't eat dinner, but birthday girl had a well-done steak and it smelled/looked fab.  All in all - great place to dine and eat/drink! I'm just not a huge fan of chains - it makes me squirm a bit. Bathrooms were pretty modern/oversized and just a nice place to powder your nose.",

I requested the prime rib to be medium rare. What came out was an under cooked flavorless piece of meat. There wasn't enough salt on the table to give it flavor. The crab was also lacking flavor and a very small portion. In defense of the restaurant the entire staff was friendly and accommodating. The manager also stopped by and asked if everything was ok. I unfortunately didn't speak up. I would go back for the service and the happy hour, but I will be passing on the bland overpriced food.",

And I haven't seen that waiter since so perhaps he found a job outside of customer service??   I talked to the manager and they were so amazing at handling the situation. Seriously major kudos! I probably wouldn't have been back if it weren't for them and it's now become a spot we frequent. The service has been great ever since as well.   The last 2 times I went I had the pecan crusted steak which is great. My friends all swear by the French onion soup and order it everytime. I'll have to try it next time.  We came in recently again as a group for a going away party for one of my BFFs. We ordered 3 desserts- the creme brulee, the coffee ice cream pie and the brownie sundae. BEST BROWNIE SUNDAE. We all ended up not really even finishing the other desserts because they didn't even compare to that one.   So this is what you should order: French onion soup pecan crusted steak brownie sundae",

I ordered the Rib Steak (bone in) with the twice baked potato and added the lobster tail. The bone in was chard to perfection and was mouth watering...seriously it was amazing. The twice baked had more favors than I could guess. The lobster tail was at expectation. It wasn't bad but it didn't overachieve my expectations  The staff and service was phenomenal!!!!

(Saturday)  should have been a clue. 3) They waited for a very long time for each and every service. 4) The designated driver ordered a Sprite which was never delivered and when that fact was pointed out, the charge was not removed and was later met with hostility.

Our group decided to try it out.   [Ambiance] We only sat in the bar area but it was very modern and the area was pretty big. Plenty of seats at the bar and surrounding area.  [Food]  The bread to start was ok. Nothing to write home about. Although, we thoroughly enjoyed the Scallops and Bacon appetizer.  The wedge salad with ranch which was really good. For the  entree, I ordered the 14 oz prime rib which I thought was excellent! Along with that came a baked potato, green beans and mushrooms. All were very tasty.  My friends ordered the chicken and ribs and seared ahi tacos which they also enjoyed.   For dessert, we got the Billy Miner Pie which was an ice cream like dessert. It was pretty good too.  [Service]  Service was excellent! Our waitress Jessi (that was name on the bill), from Mesa  (I think), did an exceptional job refilling our drinks and making sure we had what we needed at all times.  I would definitely return to the Keg Steakhouse and Bar when I come back to AZ.. even without the $25 off!",

    "text": "This Keg is in the #tempemarketplace on Mclintock Drive. Before or after your dinner or lunch, you can choose to shop at many big establishments such as JC Penny, Barnes & Noble, Nordstrom Rack, Target, just to name a few!  We went on Thanksgiving Day. We were just lucky we could even find an open reservation! Everywhere else we called, they didn't have any more seats available. Note to self--if we want to get into the Rawhide or the Westin restaurants, it would be wise to book ahead. Way ahead, we find out.  The Keg was a good choice, for the following reasons:  1. You could sit and eat at the lounge/bar area and order drinks and some apps, which we did while waiting for our 4:15 seating. The crowd was nice, not rowdy, not hipster. We had cocktails--the usual Margarita on the Rocks, and craft beers. Both were nice. But the outstanding part of this part of our pre-dinner evening, was having the Nachos with beef (instead of chicken). It was huge! There were three of us, and found the platter was very filling. Next time, we will have to stick to cocktails, skip the apps, especially since we came for a big dinner (prime rib, steak, salmon, respectively).   2.  Our server was Ryan--he was attentive, and prompt with the delivery of the sourdough crusty bread and butter, refilling our water and tea, and taking our orders. Watching most of the service staff--they looked like they were enjoying their job, and they were taking care of the customers' needs, giving the courteous but not overly friendly treatment.   3.  The rib eye that the hubby ordered was on point with it being medium rare. Just a small suggestion--do sprinkle a little bit of sea salt, and there you have it--a nearly perfect prime rib!   4. The son ordered and liked the Sirloin OSCAR (steak with seafood in bernaise sauce on top of the steak).  5.  Yours truly went with the Crusted Salmon. It is quite a big serving. A hungry pescatarian would be highly satisfied with this one. So, in other words, although the Keg is a big prime rib & steak place, don't let that discourage you from inviting your non-red meat eating spouses or significant others. There's a few other fish dishes--I will try the Tuna next time.   6. Garlic mashed potatoes. Enough said.   7.  Dessert menu. I would come here even just for the desserts! We had the Margarita key lime pie, the brownie sundae, and the Billy Miner pie. I have photos to prove how good they looked and tasted.   Why the four stars only?  I couldn't give them the perfect five  because of my own idiosyncrasies--such as, not loving having to eat in the semi-darkness, getting the feeling of over-crowding bordering on claustrophobia at times, and this casual suspicion that I've had slightly more delicious, fuller flavored prime rib and rib eye steaks somewhere else...and did not cost what our dinner cost tonight--$154.00+ and 20% tip, came to a little above $182.00. For three people.   But don't let that deter you from giving the Keg a try. Just keep your wallet forewarned.",

The birthday email promotion The Keg offers is excellent... Treat yourself by getting on their email list.   I booked through Opentable and was able to indicate that the occasion was a birthday.  A signed card was waiting on the table when we got there, a nice touch.  Our server was straightforward, attentive, and helpful, while staying out of the way of our meal and conversation.  One of the managers stopped by to check on us... A nice touch.   Our server was able to accommodate a special request for the preparation of one of the meals ordered, thank you for that!    The baseball steak was cooked excellently and the twice baked potato was interesting and tasty, though next time I may try the asparagus instead.   A nice finishing touch was the piece of birthday cake at the end.  Hand the server the printout of the promotion and it's no fuss no muss.  This restaurant has a good niche and treats their customers well while delivering quality meals.    Looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "What a surprisingly great dinner. We had never been to The Keg before just have always seen the parking lot full, so we decided to go for my boyfriends birthday who was craving a surf and turf dish. When walking in there were a bunch of people waiting but our eyes were looking for the Warriors/ Raptors game 1 so the host suggested the bar/ cocktail room which had lots of seating- which was surprising because the cocktail lounge looked just as fancy as the dining area. Our server started us with complimentary chips(I couldn't stop eating them) and a few minutes later came the complimentary bread. Our drinks were delicious and well poured. I ordered the Caesar salad with chicken added which was great- I wasn't super hungry but filled me up just enough. My boyfriend got the Steak & King Crab and he said it was delicious. He didn't finish the whole 8 oz steak so we took a little of that home along with one of the chicken breast left over from the Caesar. Our server was very attentive and overall we had a great little celebration dinner. We didn't mention it till the end when we paid that it was his birthday, but the server asked us if we wanted a glass of Champaign to celebrate or a dessert. Prices are a little up there but I expected to spend a little extra for his birthday dinner. Will be back!",

I had the black cod which was like butter and cooked perfectly. Hubby had a beautiful medium rare prime rib. Everything else on our plates was good but the meat was the absolute star. The server made a point of asking if we were celebrating anything and surprised me with the Billie Miner pie when I asked to look at the desert menu. It was a perfect way to finish off a fanatic meal. The whole experience was wonderful and I had a very happy birthday.",

    "text": "We arrived around 4:30pm on a Saturday & were seated immediately, there were at least 6 open tables that I could see at a glance. We were discussing the menu with my teen who asked if any of the steaks were bone-in & we said no, fancy restaurants don't serve steak with a bone because that is usually a cheaper cut of meat.   The atmosphere was romantic & the backs of the booth were high enough that you couldn't see the group seated in front or behind you. The music seemed to get louder 1/2 way through our meal but I didn't notice what time it was. The manager stopped by once to see how we were doing but we didn't see her again as we were leaving.  Ordered: My husband ordered the prime rib with a baked potato for $30. My daughter & I split the chicken with garlic mashed potatoes & broccoli for $22. We also split a creme brulee 3 ways for dessert & got 1 soda. Our bill came to $70. We all agreed the best thing we ate was the $6 creme brulee & second best was the garlic mashed potatoes.  My husband was disappointed that his meal only came with one side item (they call it an accompaniment) & even though he ate everything but the fat, he was still hungry driving home. My daughter & I were unpleasantly surprised to find that the chicken breast we were served had a BONE in it. (isn't it ironic?) It was not very fun removing the skin & cutting the meat away from the bone. (it felt reminiscent of KFC which I would never pay $22 for, actually we don't even ever go there) After our meal we asked to view the menu to check & it does NOT say the chicken was bone-in.   We were also served complimentary sourdough bread & butter (we probably should have asked for another serving to help fill us up).  Overall, for the $70 we spent we could have gotten much more food (& better food) at [[BJs Restaurant & Brewery where we just ate lunch yesterday. We got 4 hand crafted sodas, 3 meals, an appetizer & a dessert for $70 & left there full]]",

    "text": "The Keg is the best chain steakhouse out there.  Yes, I believe it offers better tasting main dishes and side dishes than Ruth's Chris, Morton's, etc.    Please don't let the chain label negatively influence your decision to eat at this fine establishment.  The service is impeccable.  I can't think of an instance where I haven't been treated amazingly well by the staff.  From the hostess to the server, you'll feel like you're the only guest(s) being tended to.  Additionally, the decor is beautifully understated, with low light and dark wood throughout the dining area.    I've had the bacon wrapped filet and it was succulent and delectable and cooked to my liking.  The prime rib....fuggedaboutit!!!  I was told by our server that they have a 24OZ selection that is not listed on the menu, so I immediately ordered it.  It was the size of a human thigh, but oh so amazingly tasty (OK, maybe human thigh meat is tasty too??)  The Keg's horseradish sauce is amazingly hot and I love it.  Their Au Jus is also very tasty, but I pay most of my attention to that HOT horseradish sauce. Their Mushrooms Neptune are exceptional and stand on equal footing with any other higher end restaurant's best appetizer.  The baked brie is also wonderful and the staples like the shrimp cocktail and baked garlic shrimp are also flavorful.  If you're craving a steak and can afford to spend a little more than places like Outback, stop on over and enjoy high end tasting steaks at considerably lower than high end prices  **Tip 1**  Steakhouses are by definition pricey.  Sign up for the Keg's Birthday Club and get $25 towards your meal price every year you're alive!  **Tip 2**  Happy hour runs 4PM-7PM M-F and offers some discounted appetizer and drink prices, so save yourself a couple of extra bucks.",

    "text": "I love restaurant week! A bunch of friends and I decided to get together for our birthday month (May!) This was a perfect place to do so! The service was good, the restaurant itself is par for the course as this is a chain restaurant (it is clean and low lighting as a steakhouse should be.) As for the meal......  I did the \"Phoenix Restaurant Week Special\" which was a three course meal for $30. (Steal of a deal!)   First Course: Wedge salad - lettuce wedge topped with bacon, tomatoes and ranch dressing. (fresh veggies and creamy dressing = a delectable salad.)   Second Course: The Keg Oscar - 8oz sirloin steak topped with shrimp, scallops, asparagus and Bearnaise sauce. (steak was perfectly cooked, the Bearnaise sauce with shrimp and scallops was okay. I would have preferred crab instead of shrimp & scallops but that's just me.) The entree came with a \"side\" which i picked the Twice Baked Potato, it was creamy mashed potato stuffed back into a half shell and baked again which quite delicious!  Third Course: Butter Tart -  Meh, not my favorite dessert but I like that the portion was small and that I was able to try something new i typically wouldn't order. It just didn't have a whole lot of flavor happening, just a boring sweet treat.   On other visits to The Keg I have had: * Mushrooms Neptune (mushrooms topped with crab and cream cheese.) a fav of mine! * Keg Caesar - typical romaine salad with the Keg's version of dressing (good but go with the wedge if you are going to get a salad here.)  * Filet Classic - filet steak wrapped in bacon * Prime Rib - pretty self-explanatory   * King Crab - a pound of steamed king crab legs. (So good & one of my fav's!)  This place can get a little spendy if your not careful. You may want to check out their happy hour menu (4pm to 7pm: M-F) you can try the Mushrooms Neptune for $4, the  loaded nachos for $6 and the Prime Rib Sliders for $8.",

    "text": "**Original review from 6/1/2011. Updating new profile.**  I'm not a red meat eater, but my best friend was in town and was craving a steak. I had no idea where to take her. Another friend suggested this place because it was close and she had only been here for drinks. We decided to be adventurous and give it a shot. The friend who suggested the place decided to meet us.  We were seated immediately and although I was a little disappointed that we were seated in the hallway, next to the kitchen door and across from two other tables that we had to face because our table was horseshoe shaped, the seats were far back enough that the kitchen door didn't bother me. I was still a little conscientious of the other two tables with people staring at us though. Strike one.... horrible table.  Get it out of there.  Strike one was redeemed with a fabulous waiter. He was attentive, and we never had empty glasses or plates once we ordered. We received bread, appetizers, salads, entrees and refills with no hitch.   I wasn't impressed with the appetizer, but it wasn't their fault. I just can't see myself ever having shrimp with cheese ever again. I thought it was weird when I ordered it, but was curious. Curiosity satisfied.  We received our salads and entrees and dug in. My friend's steak was cooked to her liking and loved her seafood with it. She said everything was what she was craving and expecting. Coming from her, that's a huge complement. My other friend was equally happy with her slab of meat.  My entree was the chicken oscar, which has shrimp and scallops on top in a Bearnaise sauce. Took one bite of the scallops and shrimp.... oh my. Yummmmm. Scallops were cooked perfectly. I love scallops that melt in your mouth. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. Still crispy, not over-cooked. Then I get to the chicken and this is where strike two happens. The chicken was so salty that I couldn't even finish the second bite. Luckily, I was full from the veggies, scallops and shrimp and mashed potatoes I ate. When the waiter asked if he could take my plate and I said yes, he asked if there was something wrong with the chicken. So, being honest, I told him. At this point, I'm full, fat, dumb and happy so I declined his offer to replace it with something else.   Then here's where they redeemed themselves on strike two. Even though I told him it was unnecessary, the manager came over and apologized to all three of us. He looked at me and said he comped my salad and entree and then offered all three of us desserts and coffees on the house. He explained the saltiness comes from the rub the cooks use and he's asked them before not to use so much. I barely heard this because I was still astounded that not only is my entire meal free, but now desserts for all three of us too? And coffee? Who am I to turn down free coffee???  Then the manager asked me something I love to hear: Do you have any allergies? WHY YES I DO! NUTS!  He explained that I should not get these certain desserts and offered me all the nut free options. I asked him if I could marry him. It's been too long since someone in a restaurant asked me this before I could say something.  I would go back for another dinner. I know how to modify my meal to my satisfaction now. I would also recommend this place to my friends and family.",

We ordered prime rib sliders, garlic shrimp, and later a keg burger (delicious! I'm not normally a burger person.) I also had 2 margaritas and 2 glasses of red wine (lol.) They definitely give you a nice pour of the wine.   Our server Jordan was amazing! She was super sweet and attentive but never overbearing. She never made us feel rushed at all. Service is always consistent in the lounge area I've noticed  I've only been to the keg for happy hour, but I have heard great things about their full menu also. Love the keg!",

Nice place and reservations are needed on a Friday night.   Full bar and nicely dimmed place that is not for those that wants a quiet dinner. Very hip crowd.  Ordered the half Lobster and steak and was thrilled the lobster was fresh and huge, not your typical small frozen ones I seen in most restaurant. Perfectly plump and sirloin was seasoned. If you are ever in Phoenix area, give it a try. I really enjoyed the dinner and will be back on my next trip out.   We had the best server (blond hair and super attentive)!

I made easy reservations with the Open Table app. I got a confirmation call from the restaurant that I luckily answered, as I don't typically answer unknown numbers. What would have happened to our reservation if I had not answered?  We were greeted warmly by a host. The inside ambience is nice and dimly lit, like a typical steakhouse.   Once seated we were assisted by a nice guy who took our drink orders. Shorty afterwards our server appeared. Nice guy. We ordered our drinks & appetizers and went back to our conversation.  The menu commands top dollar premium menu prices for slightly above average food. This is a step up from Outback or Longhorn with top of the food chain pricing.   Overall: The Keg is nothing special and ok food that seems overpriced.",

    "text": "Another steak review. Today, ladies and gentlemen, we discuss The Keg.   What is a keg? A [typically] 30-gallon container frequently associated with beer. Why is The Keg called The Keg? I do not know, but I like the name. I also like the design of the restaurant and the arrangement of the menu. The location I do not much care for, and the food, well, it was OK.   This restaurant is most accessible by taking the McClintock entrance to Tempe Marketplace. Parking is easy, and from my experience, a reservation is not required. Well-dressed hosts await you by the wine wall when you enter, and the seating and starting services are quick and friendly.   My party tried the coffee-encrusted steak; I've never had one before, and I liked the concept behind it. I also, appropriately enough, wanted a beer to go with my meal. The serve Guinness by the bottle... a minor ding in points, but I accepted. There is expectedly a full bar, so I would be curious in the future to see how well they can mix a drink.  Our meals arrived promptly, and they were generally good. See the photo in this review: a festive smattering of vegetables, mashed potatoes that were a bit thicker than I'd like with skins abounding, and finally, a well-crusted, fist-sized cut of meat. I ordered it medium-rare, but what I got was more medium/medium-well. The generous disk of butter on top made for a nice appearance, but it was also a bit much given the size of the steak.   As mentioned, this was not a medium-rare yield despite my order, so the juices reached their limit rather early in my meal. As skillfully as I could, dinner became a task of \"mix everything with the potatoes to salvage flavor\" -- not the ideal outcome, but in doing so, I did clear my plate. We did not order any dessert items, and we left the Keg grateful for good service, but otherwise not impressed.   Thus, 3.01 stars to The Keg. With my carnivorous house of worship only a city over (take a peek in the reviews; you'll find what I'm talking about), a sequel to The Keg is most dubious at this time. However, given some of the other reviews I've seen here, I'd be curious to explore their happy hour in the future, or simply try a different item off the dinner menu. If it's an alternate cut of steak, perhaps a subtle chant of, \"Medium rare...medium rare...medium rare....\" as I wander about the restaurant will do the trick.",

But this meal fell below expectations.  The service was great. We got seated quickly and our waiter Jackson greeted us and took care of our every need. We started the meal with drinks and the punch was wonderful and strong. The bread was soft, warm and felt like it was baked in house.  But then the entree came out and the prime rib was disappointing. It tasted bland and lacked a crust. It was cooked exactly the way I wanted it but lacked flavor.  I feel like my rating is appropriate. Everything was great except for the main entree and that was disappointing considering this is a steak house.",

The prime rib sliders, calamari and teriyaki steak.  We were ultimately served these items at our table though.  The calamari was chewy, tiny and over cooked. The prime rib sliders were fatty, and cold. The shoe string onions were greasy. The teriyaki steak was the best choice of the 3. Tender and flavorful.   We had to ask for bread which we did not receive, asked a bus boy for it after a long wait. Our server was slow and inattentive. He had a large party and 2 other tables but frequently passed us.   We had the 18oz with crab and a wedge salad. Our steak was undercooked and sent back. Everything needed salting. I was hoping to order a bowl of lobster bisque with more bread, but again our server disappeared, only presenting himself to drop off refills and run.  Working in the industry seeing servers with out their hair tied back gives me the icks.  A birthday dessert would have been nice after dropping 140$ but the card was uh..a nice touch?. And management could tell at the end we were not enjoying ourselves. So that was  extra missing salt on the financial wound of dining here.",

I read one other Yelper's review about how their group had service challenges as well. It really detracts from the overall experience, and creates a negative and lasting impression when the wait staff has a bad day.  We had a group of about 14, and we had a fairly large table towards the back. It started out well. The waiter was attentive, cordial and helpful. Sadly, it went downhill from there.  Someone in our party had to keep asking for his drinks, and  the waiter was quite curt in his response. Even though he'd kept asking for his drink order several times over a time span of twenty minutes.   The food took a long time to be served. That's understandable. But, during that time, check-ins were very few and far between. Again, most of our drinks were empty.   When the food arrived, several of us that had steaks didn't get the proper cooking temperature that was requested. This could've easily been resolved if they had asked us to check whether the steaks were prepared to our liking. No such query opportunity was presented.   Again, while we were eating, we were back  to trying to flag him down.  Several thoughts ran through our minds as to our impression of the service. We could've surmised a myriad of reasons as to this service failure. The major consensus was that somehow the wait staff found fault with us in some way. They seemed so curt and unfriendly as the evening wore on.   I get it. Maybe he / they (the wait staff) were having a bad day. It does happen.   Nonetheless, you only get one chance to make a first impression. As such, this place certainly left a negative first impression on most everyone in the party that detracted from the overall experience.  The only reason that I rated this a 3 star, instead of a 1 or 2 is because I did get a return call from the establishment. It at least showed that they are prompt in attempting service recovery.",

Wait staff was excellent with good timing on drinks, apps and dinner being brought out.   We ordered a dirty martini and a cosmopolitan, both were good. For apps we did calamari and crabbed stuff mushrooms. Calamari was crunchy, we added a little salt and squeezed the lemon. The crab stuff mushrooms were too rich for my liking, it's rare you'll hear my husband or I say this but there was too much cheese. The steaks and lobster tails were cooked well and both had good flavor. The twice baked potato was delicious, creamy with just enough cheese.   Overall we were very happy with our meal and the value of everything we got!",

    "text": "Finally checked out The Keg for restaurant week, amazing!  Although the cuisine is on the upscale side the atmosphere is really laid back and casual. Some people were dressed up but the majority were were jeans and shorts.   I started the night off with the passion old fashion. Very strong but still a very good drink. It was enough to get me through the night without actually getting another drink.   I did the steak and lobster for my main entree. The menu stated lobster tails and the dish came with two.  They were very good!  I decided to do the Chicago charr on my steak which really added a great charcoal flavor. The combined with the twice baked potato certainly was a treat.   I ended my meal with the cheesecake. It came with cherry topping which I'm typically not a huge fan of but it was still really good!  I certainly plan on making my way back to The Keg in the near future.",

It's romantic and so intimate. I love it for date night and even with friends. The staff is always very nice and great with service. We've had the prime rib and the rib eye. Both perfect!!! The salad wedges, the best over had. The bacon was so good. Idk why, lol it was not Smokey or over powering. It was just amazing bacon and the wedges were topped just perfectly with dressing and toppings. The reason for the four stars. Well, the sides. It came with mushrooms. Those were good. The asparagus was great. But the mashed potatoes were dense and the vegetables were awful. No flavor. Compared to how amazing and flavorful the steaks and the wedge was I was really disappointed with the sides. The green beans I would have expected to have been cooked in a butter sauce or something. But they came out just warm with absolutely nothing done to them. . Served with red peppers. . Weird. The potatoes were sticky almost and just yuck. Could have definitely been better. But again everything else was amazing. Oh man the appetizer we got! I forgot the mushrooms. I forgot the name. Wow. Those were great too. Will definitely be back. Will try different sides maybe or none at all because the steaks are definitely worth it.",

How ever they were completely sold out of it.   So I ordered the bone in rib steak (most places incorrectly call it a bone in ribeye)   Usually the ribsteak or ribeye is what I will order to determine the quality of the restaurant   It was flavored with far too much pepper.  Like way way too much.   Jumbo shrimp were noting special just grilled shrimp no special flavor or season   Service. 4/4stars Atmosphere 4/4 stars Price 1/4 stars  Taste 2/4 stars.    11/16 stars  I would like to go back as the desserts looked good",

The staff is professional and well-trained, the ambience is enjoyable and the restaurant is always clean, however the quality of food is severely lacking.   I ordered a filet mignon, known to be the leanest and most tender cut off beef on the menu. It was well seasoned and served at the proper temperature, but the meat itself was nearly inedible. Extremely fatty and full of gristle, I cut hardly cut through it, much less chew. At $32 a plate, I expect a much better piece of meat. I'm getting Denny's quality meat at City Hall prices. Call it what you will, but this is a rip-off. I'll be taking my business somewhere else from now on.",

When we got there the place was packed, so we checked in and were seated right away. I had been to a Keg Steakhouse in Seattle a long time ago and it was not so memorable.   Last night every thing was very good. 3 ordered the the prime rib and the other ordered the the Winter Menu Black Cod.   We started with some scallops and bacon and garlic shrimp both were so small you had to eat them with tooth picks. But the dinner gets better as the evening progressed.  The prime rib was terrific as good as any Lawry's or house of Prime Rib. It comes with the Aus Ju on and a super spicy horseradish on the side. The beef was perfectly cooked.   The Black Cod was good too.   The dessert that we all shared  was a huge piece of rich chocolate cake with two scoops of vanilla ice cream with some raspberry syrup. It was yummy.  The service was great and the bill was even better $140 with drinks w/o tip.",

There was an issues with a salad coming out rotten in the middle, we didn't need the manager to \"stop by\" the table but rather the waiter could have simply removed the charge from our bill since it was barely eaten instead of charging us for the rotten salad. Also, our waiter took more interest in other tables around us and we had to stop him several times to get drinks refilled that were empty and to get items brought to the table because he was not checking on us. It was supposed to be a special evening since we had a birthday in the group and I wished we had chosen a different restaurant to celebrate at.",

We came on August 17, to celebrate my birthday and his new promotion of GM certification with a different chain. It was a last minute choice so we came with no reservation later on in the evening after 8 p.m. I ordered  crab legs and he had lobster I believe. Our waitress was very informal, we both sat on the same side of the booth and she took our order with her knee on the other booth. She did that the few times she did come to our table. We passed on appetizers and had salads, the food was exceptional just the service very mediocre. We were almost done with dinner and I still had a piece of crab meet literally almost to my mouth and she asked if she could take my plate. Obviously I wasn't finished. We didn't order dessert. I felt it was a rushed experience. I called a few days later and spoke with the GM, I forgot his name. He did apologize and stated that each dinner was expected to be a 2 hour experience and we shouldn't have felt rushed. He did find our ticket time and agreed that it did seem fast. I just wanted to let him know of the very casual service and rushed time, and he offered to send something to us. We have not received anything and that was almost a month ago, I figured it would be a free appetizer or a percentage off our next visit. We won't be coming back. Overall great food, bad service.",

I can't say exactly what it is, but there's an overall feeling that everytime we go it's a great experience. It's a treat and it feels like a treat. We get great food, and a lot of it, we get a nice bottle of wine and a plate of sides to share and then we can just sit back and relax and enjoy it. I think the service is perfect too - waiters are attentive without hoovering. Anytime something goes slightly off, like when the bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock, they always go out of their way to make it better by offering us a desert on the house - which is just really nice. Not that things go wrong very often and when they do it's always something really small. It might be a chain but it doesn't feel that way, it feels special and delivers a quality experience.",

The food is atrocious, and the only reason so many reviewers love this place is because they love the taste of salt.  If you like this place and eat here often, you probably have diabetes - fair warning.  I tried the crab legs in order to avoid the salt.  Instead of the mixed vegetables I ordered for a side, I got a blob of tasteless, over-salted mashed potatoes that had a nice thick skin as though they had been sitting under a heat lamp for an extended period of time.   I would have sent it back, but the pile of barely cooked bell peppers that passed for mixed vegetables on another diner's plate looked just as bad.  No shellfish fork, and no butter.  I should have let sleeping dogs lie, as the melted butter they brought tasted rancid, and I suspect is what made me sick and has me up at 2 am writing this review.  Worst of all is the price they charge for this dreck.  I could have gone to a fine dining restaurant with a chef and a seasonal menu.  Instead I got the Keg's corporate menu that has not changed for years and a line cook who's only trick is to pour on the salt.  NEVER AGAIN!",

I ordered the trio of sides which included some mushrooms, steamed asparagus and sweet potato fries. Our service was great, which typically it always is at The Keg. Big beers, nice sides, and for the meat eaters great steaks. Steakhouses should just offer a big ass portobello mushroom for vegs.",

    "text": "We decided to eat at The Keg recently as the nearby Barnes & Noble was the only place in town that had an item in stock that I needed that weekend. We chose immediate seating on the patio rather than a 45 minute wait inside. The misters had been going full force when we arrived, so we thought it wouldn't be too bad. We were mistaken. They are pointed at the arriving patrons, and not on the poor suffering fools on the patio. The initial table to which we were led was completely wobbly, so we asked the server if we could change to one not even 10 feet away. This, apparently, caused a rift in the universe from which the rest of the serving staff failed to recover for the remainder of our time there. We watched several of our dishes walk on by, and bewildered staff take them back indoors, only to return minutes later and ask, \"Did you switch tables?\" Wow. There are three other tables out here, in completely different stages of their meal. How hard would it have been to figure it out?  Anyway, the food was not bad at all. Our beers were cold and tasty. The bread was just OK- hot and crusty, but a little bland and doughy in the middle. My Caesar salad was overdressed for my taste, but Hubby's French Onion Soup was delicious- when he finally got it. The wait was ridiculous, even after our server said she was checking on it twice and a manager did as well. Hubby's french dip sandwich was less rare than he likes (Houston's french dip is his gold standard), but far better than many others we've had. He liked the fresh horseradish a lot. My prime rib was fork-tender, a little fatty, but quite tasty.   A storm blew in quickly, with bad winds that forced us indoors to track down our waitress and check. She then ran out to collect the family with 2 young girls and brought them inside. Overall, the meal was about a 3.5, but the service was dreadful. Hopefully for The Keg, this is a new restaurant issue, and they will get their act together. Also be warned that this location is only open for dinner right now, and that many menu items that have been highly recommended by other Yelpers are lunch items available at other Kegs only.",

Since I discovered and Old Fashioned, I have been looking for bars that serve an excellent one. Well, I found my Phoenix Old Fashioned location! It was almost perfect, the only way it could have been better is if their ice were something other than just cubes. It was the perfect amount of citrus, perfect amount of bitters, and perfect amount of alcohol. I had mine made with Jameson, and I will definitely have another the next time I go.   This Old Fashioned destroyed the drinks from Mable's on Main (Scottsdale), Turf (Phoenix), and a number of other places around the valley.   This would make a great place to go to dinner and have a few drinks before going to see a movie while at Tempe Marketplace. I have heard the happy hour specials at The Keg are pretty good.",

We were seated on the patio along with several other guests, but for some reason our server only had one table on the patio - us.  And she constantly forgot about us.  It took about 30 minutes to get our drinks and place our order.  The food was out in reasonable time (someone else delivered it).  But then no check to see if everything looks good, is as-ordered, nada.  After we got our food, we didn't see her again for 30 minutes!  Our food was gone, but empty plates remained.  Our first round of cocktails was long gone (and we would have had more if offered).  By the time she came out to bring us our check even our waters were bottomed out!  She brought the check with no apology and didn't offer to refill drinks, and left the dirty and obviously empty plates.  We gave her our credit card right away fearing we may not see her again for another hour.  And if you can believe it we sat for another 30 minutes after giving her our card!  At this point, we missed the movie we were hoping to catch and we were not happy.  She came back out to patio, saw us, and rudely asked \"did she not bring you the check?!?\"... we say, \"ummm no\" thinking, obvioulsy not, we are still here amongst dirty dishes and empty glasses... she stormed off with a huff and no explanation or apology.  The manager brought out our final check a few minutes later and did end up apologizing for the internal miscommunication, and offered to buy us another round of drinks.  We passed; after sitting for 2 hours at this place we wanted to run far far away.  IMO he shouldn't have charged us for the first round of drinks when he personally ran our card.  But no, he went ahead and charged us full price for everything with only an offer for a couple of drinks.  We will NEVER eat here again.  Terrible service.",

I asked for the filet to be cooked medium rare, and it came out unevenly cooked -- half was well done and the other half was medium well.  The asparagus was so over-cooked that it resembled the pressure cooked stuff that comes out of a can.  I couldn't eat it.  The lobster was the best thing on the plate, but even it was a bit rubbery.  Even if they had cooked my food correctly, I'm not sure the experience would have been much better.  The food quality is only marginally better than Outback, but the price is much higher -- more like an upscale steakhouse. If you are looking for something that's a little better than Outback, then this might be the place for you.  However, since your already paying upscale prices, I would prefer to go to somewhere like Morton's, Ruth's Chris, The Palm, or Donovan's.  At places like these, you pay for quality and you actually get it.  I'm not sure I'll go back to The Keg.",

    "text": "The Keg is a great place to go and spend a special evening with someone. I've dined there almost a dozen times, and even after trying a few more well known or more expensive steakhouses, I continue to go to The Keg. I first went to The Keg when they opened Tempe Marketplace with my boyfriend on one of our vey first dates. It's very modern and dimly lit, which I love. I always request a booth so I've never had a problem with seating or being stuck in a loud section of the restaurant. My experiences have always been quiet with light background music, perfect for conversation. Because it was our first visit to the restaurant, the manager sent over a complimentary shrimp cocktail. Which was actually really awesome because we both love shrimp cocktail. The Kegs shrimp cocktail comes with nice big shrimp, displayed beautifully in a martini glass. And we have ordered it every time since.  We normally get a bottle of wine, The Keg has a good standard selection with fair prices, taking into account that you are paying for presentation and atmosphere. I'm a stickler for wine presentation so I love that for the most part, all of the servers I've had at The Keg know what they're doing. The dinner menu is simple, which is nice. I hate cluttered menus. I always get the Petite Filet Mignon, which is wrapped in bacon. I'll send a steak back if it's not done the way I asked and i've never sent anything back while dining at The Keg. The service has always been excellent. All the servers are friendly and know the menu well. I've never had a bad experience. Actually, I normally have really great experiences where I save the servers name so I can request them another time. All in all I would definitely recommend The Keg to anyone who would like to enjoy a wonderful evening of good wine and great steaks in a modern atmosphere right here in Tempe.",

    "text": "The Keg Steakhouse and Bar was a pleasant surprise!  I was looking for somewhere to meet my friend after work, and happened upon The Keg at Tempe Marketplace.  I love the dark atmosphere inside, and there is also the option of a very comfortable and inviting outdoor patio.  The service was great, the servers were friendly and conversational, and the food was to die for!.  My friend and I ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops and the warm goat cheese rolled in almonds and served with tomato basil salsa.  Both were delicious, but the goat cheese and salsa blew me away!  In addition, for those who drink they have an extensive (and reasonably priced) drink menu, with some unique and interesting concoctions (some day I'll have to try a martini with egg white froth), and wine by the glass is half price during happy hour.  I enjoyed a lovely white zin in the \"Keg size\" 9 oz glass for only $4.00!  All in all, it was a very pleasant and sophisticated atmosphere, the food was great, and the prices were in line with your typical TGI Friday's or Applebee's, both of which pale by comparison.  Actually, they more than pale, they turn ghastly white and keel over from the pressure of even trying to come close to comparing...The Keg Steakhouse and Bar FTW!",

I ordered the prime rib classic which includes the wedge salad, prime rib (10 oz) & 1 side ($30). My companion ordered the Top Sirloin classic which includes sirloin, salad & baked potato. ($28). Prices are reasonable; but the food  was a little disappointing. First of all, my wedge salad was wilted, didn't taste fresh. My prime rib was a big disappointment. I ordered medium; it did come as pink in the center. But the whole prime rib was very chewy; indeed it was a little tough (even though it's pink in the center). I eat prime rib in other restaurants & always order medium, & the prime rib comes out juicy & flavorful. This one was not tender, juicy or tasty. My companion's top sirloin was better, but still lacked flavor. Is it  because of the cook or the quality of meat that is the problem? I would hope that they will improve the food, because I really like this restaurant.",

I called ahead of time to check how long was the wait and from that initial contact I was a happy customer. When we arrived we didn't wait much to b seated. Once we were seated we were greeted my Hannah out waitress. She was very helpful because she went over the menu with us and pointed out her favorites. That was awesome because it helped us decide what we were going to order.  Our appetizer came out immediately. Our salads followed. Let  me get into the food.. My husband ordered the Filet Mignon with the tiger shrimp. The meat was cooked to perfection very juicy and just delicious . I ordered from the keg classics. Let me say that my sirloin steak was simply amazing. It was cooked just as I ordered and once it hit my taste buds I was in heaven. To drink I had a strawberry mojito which was the best I've I had. Hannah again was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. I will definitely come again when I visit arizona again",

There were 5 of us at the table and it was difficult to hear each other until about 9PM when half the other tables cleared out... we were there 2 hrs at that point trying to hold a conversation on a normal level... it did not happen.  Not only was it loud with people talking, being a large high ceiling room so the sound carries, but the music was turned up too... so people probably raised their voices to compete with the music. When the room is packed, turn the music off! I don't see going back to this location if it will be this noisy.  I just could not enjoy a dinner with friends this way. It felt like being at a sports bar.   I usually go to The Keg in Chandler, and love it - it has none of these issues... it is all about the building design. Chandler = good, Tempe = bad.",

    "text": "I love steak. It's my favorite food, my dying wish, my best friend and my version of PMS Ice Cream. I really, truly love steak. Some people (my mother) attribute it to my O+ Blood Type, others to my very outdoorsy/hunting family, and my vegetarian friends just think it's because I'm nuts. But no matter the reason, it's the best thing since The Big Bang. For this reason, I feel uniquely qualified to review a steakhouse, and even more so because I once worked at one of the best in the state.  As a college student who has a discriminating palate and a thin wallet, I take advantage of good deals when I find 'em - and The Keg has an AMAZING deal for you. For your birthday and/or anniversary, they send you an email redeemable for a free entree of some type. Last year was Caesar Salad, Prime Rib,  and your choice of side. This year is an 8oz Sirloin with the same accoutrements.  So sign up for their birthday/anniversary club, you definitely won't regret it.  The steak I had last night for my birthday was really pretty good! I'm not much of a sirloin lover - I prefer Rib Eye because of the juicy flavors from more marbling, but this Red Meat Lover would never turn down a steak. The Top Sirloin was tender, moist, and had a really good flavor. AND they cooked it to my perfect Medium-Rare specifications. As my side, I chose the Twice Baked Potato; I wish they had brought me three more, they were so delicious! The Caesar Salad was pretty good, but the dressing wasn't anchovy-ey enough for me.   Overall, I wouldn't kick The Keg out of my bed, and I would probably invite it in. I only go here once a year because it's all I can afford at this point, but if I had the $$$, I would  definitely go back more frequently!!",

Supposedly there's Gin in this drink but I did not taste a drop!  I tried the Teriyaki Chicken with a yummy pineapple cilantro salsa!  I chose the Twice Bake Potato as my side....omg there's bacon it!  This was amazing and I need the recipe!  They don't have a bad happy hour menu.

It came with little pieces of toast and some jelly and pesto. He had a sirloin, oscar style with asparagus,crab,scallops and bernaise. I had the short ribs. The server,Hannah, was fantastic. She mixed up my side, which wasn't her fault as I changed my mind 3different times ( mashed....no..wait, twice baked...no...regular baked...no...twice baked etc...) but she remedied the problem right away. My friend is a manager at a high end steak house in Tahoe and when he complemented her, she informed us that it was only her second week! She kept up on his coffee, which isn't easy, brought everything in a timely manner and was super friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and will definitely be back.",

I went here with a group of friends for their birthday dinner (a party of 10) which was not a problem at all. The restaurant was very nice and at the risk of being cliche and corny - had a great dinner ambiance. It's not too dimly lit and tables are far away enough for you to have some space with your party. I've been cursed with excellent hearing and being easily distracted with background noise, which means I can usually pick up on couples fighting at their dinner table right away. Though it can be quite entertaining, it is also very annoying.   The food was excellent and our entire party enjoyed their meals as well. I ordered a bruschetta appetizer, caesar salad, and the top sirlion with garlic mash. Our server was excellent and very attentive to our party...then to top it off they gave the birthday guest free dessert along with a birthday card from the staff. It was a small gesture, but certainly appreciated! I will definitely come back here.",

The Keg offers something that is rare in the Valley: an atmosphere that is conversation-encouraging. By this I mean the staff get along with each other really well, this shows. This is important because this rubs off on customers and allows them to feel as if they are being included in a group. Even more important: their music is kept at a reasonable volume. I have made so many great friends at the Keg and it's simply because I can talk to them. They have great cocktails, an okay selection of wine and an okay selection of beer but I am comfortable getting drinks I've already had a lot because I know I am still going to have a great time anyways!

It's served as 3 small hot dogs or the hot dog version of sliders topped with sweet chili.

We hadn't been to Tempe Marketplace yet and thought why not give something new a try. And for me it's always another chance to review a new try on <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a>. So this is how we wound up at The Keg Steakhouse.  It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday evening so we were offered three seating choices: lounge, outside patio or the dining room. We chose the lounge since we wanted to be casual and the Cubs were playing the Diamondbacks.  We both ordered basically the same thing Chicken Strips his with Ceasar Salad, mine with Fries. (Too bad it didn't come with a toy!) The only issue we had was both coming out with salads instead of mine with fries. Okay I could have eaten the salad, god knows I could stand to lose few lbs., but heck I REALLY wanted fries and had to send it back. Our server came back with the fries in a few minutes and apologized profusely saying that it was her mistake. Hey, we've all made mistakes, right? And it wasn't the end of the world I got my fries.  So the moral of the story is I would have given them five stars had the order been right. They probably deserve 4 1/2 stars, but I can't do that on yelp.  Give The Keg a try when you're at Tempe Marketplace!",

The prime ribs did not look very appetizing but tasted OK. Not once to the waitress come back to ask if we needed more water or a refill on a drink,But I still tipped her 20%, not sure why. Nice atmosphere but in my opinion quite overpriced for what you get.",

I wasn't too fond of the drink that I ordered, but that didn't affect my overall experience with the place.  Everyone at our table ordered steak. We ordered 2 New York Strips and 1 Peppered Steak. I usually always order rare, but I wish I had ordered the Medium. My steak was cooked perfectly, but I tried the Medium cooked steak and it was also very juicy with extra flavor from the grill that my rare piece didn't have (obviously because it was taken off sooner). Still so amazing though. The proportions are very filling!  The main menu and kids menu all contain great selections. It was very difficult to decide. We celebrated a birthday and the staff was so kind to bring a complimentary dessert and something special for the child at the table (vanilla ice cream). The ice cream was actually amazing also, not the typical vanilla you can get anywhere.  The complimentary birthday dessert was a slice of mocha java ice cream pie with an Oreo crust.... absolutely spectacular!   This place is SO good that you'll want to come back, I know we certainly will. You could easily spend over $100 in one visit here.",

I ordered my steak medium and it was brought to the table well-done. They graciously took it back and brought another out very quickly. They were apologetic and very responsive, but the second one was about as well-done as the first. It was seasoned well with a nice peppery crust though. Also, the asparagus had no seasoning.  Appetizers, other steaks I tried from colleagues plates, and drinks were very good. Service was excellent.  This could have been a 4 star experience had it.not been for the steak temp, but they excelled in other regards. I'd advise not ordering the peppercorn strip because it is cut thin and apparently makes it difficult to get doneness  right for them.",

First time eating at The Keg and I must say for the amount of money they charge for the food, I could have gotten twice the meal for a much better quality elsewhere. I went there for my birthday with my entire family (there were 8 of us total).   Though the wait staff was very friendly and attentive to our drinks and such (hence the reason for the only stars on this review), the food was not worth the price. I ordered the steak and crab legs meal. This wasn't cheap! The meat wasn't done to what I asked (medium rare), and was way overcooked. My brother ordered the same thing and they had forgotten one of his sides. The cut of meat was definitely smaller than a filet mignon. Nothing earth-shattering about the meat cut either. No biggie, right? But the \"crab\" was ONE LEG That's right... ONE LEG. The vegetables that were served were dried out and almost room temperature like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. This entree was over $50!!!!!!! Though I saw this on the menu, when it came out I nearly fell off my chair. Sadly, I was still hungry when I left. When I asked the waiter if this is all that came with it, he just nodded and walked away.   I really had high hopes for this venue, but needless to say it was my first, and easily my last visit. Outside of the atmosphere, if you're looking for more meal for your buck, definitely look elsewhere. Ruth Chris prices for a meal you could get at Outback Steakhouse.",

The service was horrible, the food and drinks were mediocre. For drinks, I ordered the Orange Slice to start. It was a martini but tasted like a screwdriver with a splash of vodka. My second drink was the Pinot Noir. This one I liked. For food, we ordered the crab cakes, nachos and baked brie. The cheese on the nachos was really dry and didn't taste very fresh to me. I actually liked the baked brie. The cheese and pesto that it came with was really good.   Service.. I've never been a waitress and I understand we were with a big group but I would think you would go around the whole group asking what everyone wanted. Plus there were 2-3 waitresses helping with our group. Never once did that happen. We basically had to flag down the waitress every time we wanted to order something. On top of that, we asked her for the happy hour menu maybe 3 times or more and she never once brought it. We ended up talking to the manager who eventually brought the menu and told him we were very disappointed in the service. We got an apology. I would've thought he could've at least gave us a small discount on the bill, or something complimentary. Anything. Nope. I won't be back for happy hour.",

This restaurant dims their lights for \"ambiance\" but I felt it was little too low because I had trouble reading the menu and always wonders what are they hiding???.    Started off with a cocktail-Ginger Peach Tea--delicious!  Their sourdough table bread is very tasty.  I order the 6oz top sirloin (medium) with asparagus.  I had high hopes because the cocktail was delicious.  It came with roasted red bell peppers and greens beans and no other sauce...  I was a bit confused and didn't know there was an option to add a sauce (extra charge) to it--as I mentioned before a bit too dim to read the menu.  While the steak was cooked to a perfect medium, salt and pepper was a bit lacking on it.  The asparagus and green beans literally looked like they were boiled-- no spices that I could taste.   The roasted peppers tasted.....roasted.  I wanted to ask for butter and garlic and onion powder for the veggies....   The 3 stars is for the cocktail, the bread and the service-not so much the main course. They could've made a better attempt to make the green beans and asparagus a bit more appetizing.",

The wait staff was attentive, and must have all been models because it was probably the best looking staff I have ever seen in a restaurant.   That being said, the most I can give this place for the meal I had is 3 stars.  I had the keg burger, and my buddy had the 7 oz. filet.  He said his was good. Mine, not so much.  The menu description sounded fantastic, and our server recommended it to me. I ordered it with a side of asparagus.   When the plate arrived, the server presented it on what appeared to be a hot plate (he used a cloth napkin as a hot mitt) so I was excited. Well, the asparagus was cold to start. The burger was slapped onto a cold, straight-outta-the-wrapper bun.  I can get the same buns at a local supermarket.  It was not warmed, steamed, toasted, anything.    The burger was a delicious sounding combination of meats, however lacked much flavor when executed. The flavor balance of the whole thing was thrown off by the quantity of strong pickles added on top of and underneath my burger.  It wasn't horrible, just underwhelming considering all the reviews.  Bottom line for me is that I don't think I would go back for dinner. I may go back to have a drink or two at the bar, people watch, and watch a game.",

The Keg has a birthday club which I highly recommend, as one dinner is free for the night. In honesty, it is only the main course that is free, with all side dishes and entrees additional cost.  We started off with cocktails - I ordered a chocolate martini and companion ordered a brandy alexander. Both cocktails were full measure and properly made. The barkeep definitely knows how to make a good cocktail and not skimp.  Next came appetizers. I ordered escargot with mushroom caps and companion ordered calamari with ginger sauce and feta sauce. Both appetizers were excellent and I could not resist dipping a piece of the fresh warm bread into the sauce. I'm not sure they would have to wash the plate after that!  Next was the main course. Companion ordered the 14 oz prime rib and pronounced it the best ever. It was served with asparagus and a side of mushrooms. The meat was so tender that companion could have eaten it with a spoon.  My main course was the 20 oz bone in rib steak, which is supposed to be the king of steaks. It was well seasoned. Unfortunately, mine was the joker of steaks. Filled with streaks of sinew that were virtually impossible to cut through or chew. I ordered a side of bearnaise sauce which came in a little metal pitcher that could hold about 2 oz and which was filled with about 1 oz of a very poor, tasteless bearnaise sauce totally devoid of any tarragon taste or champagne vinegar. My side dish was pencil asparagus that were properly cooked though no hollandaise sauce was offered with it, and a pile of limp, flaccid green beans that I'm sure saw a better life the day before.  As befitting a restaurant with a bill over $100, the place was spotless as was the bathroom. Service was paced and not rushed.  This is a mixed review in that one meal was outstanding and the other was poor to be generous. I have eaten USDA good steaks that were more tender than what was served to me. If I were the inspector for USDA I'd grade the steak as utility grade it was so poor. The manager came over and inquired about my steak, which I was busily trying to saw through. When I told him how poor it was he said he would come back and check on it, but he never came back and I have taken the remains home in the hope that a truly sharp knife will allow me to cut it up and feed it to my dogs. This is not meant to be an exaggeration nor a put down of the restaurant, but a plea that they either change their purveyor or inspect their meat more thoroughly. It was a very disappointing birthday.  3 stars for cleanliness, service, and some parts of the meal.",

I ordered a filet, perfectly cooked/seasoned and my boyfriend had a whole lobster. I was amazed at how good both dishes were. Definitely gives places like Ruth's Chris a run for their money.   Where they definitely win is their customer service. It cannot be beat. Other high end restaurants have often had stuck up and unfriendly staff, but the Keg is a very different experience. The waiter knew it was my birthday and had the head chef come out to bring a complimentary desert and talk to us. It made it such a special experience because it was a busy Friday night.",

The steaks were okay, but they were not seasoned to what I would prefer. I ordered New York steak with the seafood medley on the side and it was not worth the extra cost as there was very little seafood to eat. My boyfriend ordered the ribeye and said it was pretty good but not worth the $100 plus we spent. The last thing I was disappointed in was the Mac and cheese side, all of the pictures looked great online but when it actually got to the table it had shredded cheese all on the top that was not melted at all. Two stars because the steak was decent and the waiter was pretty good. Would not come back for steak as you could get more for your money at a place like Texas Roadhouse, but the happy hour looks decent.",

I also ordered for the table garlic butter shrimp this was a little better, but not much! Bread that was brought out to table and was not that good at all either it was crumbling apart while trying to put butter on it. The staff was really nice, but took forever to get our dinners out. They said there was big party before us, so who knows! Overall was not what i remembered about this place. My friends had Ribeye steaks and Enjoyed  there Steaks. In the end manager came out and apologised.",

She brings me a monstrous bowl of lobster bisque with one spoon and no bowls and leaves and doesn't look at us again for 20 minutes, when she did bring her eyes off the ground I asked her if this was off the appetizer menu, which I knew it was, but wanted to hear it from her, she says yes, I hold the spoon up and say we got one spoon and no bowls for 3 people, she says oh I thought you ordered that just for you. WT literal F???? Its an appetizer, there are 3 people at the table and after I ordered the appetizer I ordered steak and a twice baked potato, bitch how much food do you think I'm eating, ITS AN APPETIZER, THERE ARE 3 PEOPLE AT THE TABLE, OMG!!!! She was not attentive to us, literally barely looked at us, my daughter gave her more of a tip than I would have and I always overtip people. I just think if your going to pay 50.00 a person for your meal, your waitress can at least pretend like she gives a f$%#@",

I ordered the steak and lobster ($38 for 6 ounce steak and 6 ounce lobster) and my husband had the three course meal (restaurant week for $44 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert). The appetizer came and it was garlic shrimp and I just say it was delicious. I loved the baked cheese on top of the shrimp. Then our entrees came and my husband had a prime rib oscar. He said it was average. I ordered my steak medium well and it was a bit dry..I've had medium well steak at other restaurants before and they're not dry..but this place made my steak relatively dry. The lobster was really good though..I just wish they had some sort of creamy sauce to go with the lobster. Then the dessert came and we had some sort of ice cream coffee pie. That was good..I love ice cream desserts.",

We all ordered steaks plus we got a glass of wine, a bottle of wine, three desserts and a coffee. I was okay with all of that but $7 for coffee?  I thought Starbucks was pricey.   The steaks were all cooked as requested, which is often hard to get. The side veggies were extremely scant but the 'accompaniments' were large. It was a satisfying meal and, including tip it came to $50 per person.   Recommendations: Bleu Cheese Filet (lots of cheese); Sirloin Oscar, (topped with shrimps and scallops); creme brulee (huge).",

They were very colorful and fresh. The quinoa salad was also an excellent choice, but they will charge an extra $3 because it isn't a regular side item listed on the menu.

The bacon wrapped scallops were awesome, the chicken wings excellent with a little kick, the batter idami yummy...the pizza also very good. The drinks were very generous in portions, you got to mix your own. They brought a glass of Crown and ice each time, I got add how much Pepsi to add. Saw that with others....so if you ended up thinking \"straight up\" there was that option.   The servers were plentiful, and the drinks came quickly. I wandered inside at one point to watch the end of the hockey game and observed the bartender and how it was all run. What an art form, these folks were moving but at no time was there a hiccup, and the food that passed by us from the kitchen area was also amazing.

I've eaten at this Keg a few times, but there was a Keg back home north of Seattle that we'd go for special occasion family dinners sometimes, so The Keg has always held a special place in my heart.   You'll get a very good meal here. Not to the level of a Fleming's or Morton's, and not even close to a City Hall experience, but you also don't pay anything close to what you pay at those places, which is nice. Two people can have a nice dinner and a glass of wine each and get out for $75 + tax and tip. I typically get the filet meal with a Caesar salad and twice baked potato. They also have good ribs, and my wife had the prime rib once and seemed to like it.   The \"Keg Dinners\" are the way to go, since they're all under $30 and come with a steak, a side and a salad. None of the a la carte stuff that kills you at other steakhouses.  Service is always attentive, even if you sit in the bar area, which makes that a nice option when it's a 45 minute wait. The drinks are good, and their desserts are tasty and well priced. We've had the creme brulee a few times, and it's quite good.  It's really close to where we live, so we're here occasionally. There are better steakhouses out there, but The Keg is a really good one for the money.",

The atmosphere was very nice and my party and I were able to talk and have a good time. I had some issues with the meal, but in reality I think they were mostly user error. I was going to go for the steak and seafood special, but when my friend ordered a salad, I realized that special did not come with salad. Instead I went for the top sirloin because it said potato and salad - but apparently there is a top sirloin classic. It seems that I ordered the one without the salad. My friend ordered a prime rib and she said she liked it, so I will go with that - but for me, it was under cooked. Prime rib is typically medium rare and pink throughout, but this was solid red like it just came off the Bashsa's shelf. I would have sent it back, but she liked it.  The desserts were excellent. Each person in my party had a different one - the coffee ice cream cake, the cream brulee, the chocolate cake and a cheese cake. YUM-O  The service was good and the quality of the food (although not what I was expecting) was very good. I have learned to listen to my friend and not change my mind at the last minute and to read the menu details before ordering :)",

    "text": "I'm not a red meat eater, but my best friend was in town and was craving a steak. I had no idea where to take her. Another friend suggested this place because it was close and she had only been here for drinks. We decided to be adventurous and give it a shot. The friend who suggested the place decided to meet us.  We were seated immediately and although I was a little disappointed that we were seated in the hallway, next to the kitchen door and across from two other tables that we had to face because our table was horseshoe shaped, the seats were far back enough that the kitchen door didn't bother me. I was still a little conscientious of the other two tables with people staring at us though. Strike one.... horrible table.  Get it out of there.  Strike one was redeemed with a fabulous waiter. He was attentive, and we never had empty glasses or plates once we ordered. We received bread, appetizers, salads, entrees and refills with no hitch.   I wasn't impressed with the appetizer, but it wasn't their fault. I just can't see myself ever having shrimp with cheese ever again. I thought it was weird when I ordered it, but was curious. Curiosity satisfied.  We received our salads and entrees and dug in. My friend's steak was cooked to her liking and loved her seafood with it. She said everything was what she was craving and expecting. Coming from her, that's a huge complement. My other friend was equally happy with her slab of meat.  My entree was the chicken oscar, which has shrimp and scallops on top in a Bearnaise sauce. Took one bite of the scallops and shrimp.... oh my. Yummmmm. Scallops were cooked perfectly. I love scallops that melt in your mouth. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. Still crispy, not over-cooked. Then I get to the chicken and this is where strike two happens. The chicken was so salty that I couldn't even finish the second bite. Luckily, I was full from the veggies, scallops and shrimp and mashed potatoes I ate. When the waiter asked if he could take my plate and I said yes, he asked if there was something wrong with the chicken. So, being honest, I told him. At this point, I'm full, fat, dumb and happy so I declined his offer to replace it with something else.   Then here's where they redeemed themselves on strike two. Even though I told him it was unnecessary, the manager came over and apologized to all three of us. He looked at me and said he comped my salad and entree and then offered all three of us desserts and coffees on the house. He explained the saltiness comes from the rub the cooks use and he's asked them before not to use so much. I barely heard this because I was still astounded that not only is my entire meal free, but now desserts for all three of us too? And coffee? Who am I to turn down free coffee???  Then the manager asked me something I love to hear: Do you have any allergies? WHY YES I DO! NUTS!  He explained that I should not get these certain desserts and offered me all the nut free options. I asked him if I could marry him. It's been too long since someone in a restaurant asked me this before I could say something.  I would go back for another dinner. I know how to modify my meal to my satisfaction now. I would also recommend this place to my friends and family.",

My husband's fries and coleslaw were missed and not served until he was nearly finished with his ribs. My Caesar salad had bitter lettuce that was brown around the edges. We ordered the key lime pie with raspberry drizzle but we got ours with that fake strawberry stuff which was overly sweet. They did make that right and brought the right pie & did not charge us for it. I think they do try but too many corners are being cut to save a buck. We will not return at these prices.

The service and follow up was great, we changed the time and the number of people a few times but Kelly always handled it very well.  We ordered off the full menu, had many appetizers to start, full dinners, desserts and drinks.  The service was great and so was the food - everyone seemed very pleased with the selection (some vegetarians) and timing of the meals - sometimes in a large group the food doesn't come out together but this wasn't an issue.  It is always hard to plan a dinner in a city you are not familiar with, but I would recommend The Keg to anyone in the area or anyone planning to visit Tempe.",

Once we were done with our meal he gave us a box n walked away ive dinned at the keg before our waiters always offered to box everything up then i asked to please see the dessert menu since he did not offer it i had mentioned to him that it was my mothers birthday he did not wait or make suggestions 8 min later he took our dessert order. I loved my past experiances at the keg but this one was left a bad taste in my mouth, other than tat the food was  good i probably will just never go to this paticular one....one bad apple shouldnt ruin the bunch",

    "text": "I went to The Keg for the very first time, last night, not really knowing what to expect.    I arrived with five in my party and since we were there for a relatively early dinner (5:30ish), we only had to wait a few minutes before we were seated.    The restaurant has a nice ambiance which, depending on your company, can either be romantic or relaxing.  Three of us started our meal off with cocktails.  One person ordered a draft (which came in a large pilsner), another ordered a classic gin martini, and I was in the mood for something sweet and fruity, so the waitress recommended the \"Mango Time.\"    While the draft beer are served in huge glasses, the martinis are served in standard size, and the frozen drinks are, I think, a little on the small side, relative to price of what you would pay at other restaurants.    I was a little surprised at my drink when it arrived, 'cause it was just plain.  No sugar rim, no garnish of any kind - not even a little sprig of mint.  I guess it's not a big deal, but with the way the restaurant tries to present itself, I expected more.  Speaking of expecting more: I expected more TASTE from my cocktail.  Maybe it's just me, 'cause the waitress raved about this drink, but, frankly, it wasn't good.  When I had my first sip, I didn't taste anything until the very end when I detected a faint hint of over-ripe mango.  To the restaurant's credit, though, the waitress was pleasant about it and substituted my drink for a strawberry daiquiri which was pretty good - sugar rim, no whipped cream or strawberry garnish, though. *pout*  We decided to skip appetizers (we ordered bread baskets early and filled up - they were like soft, warm, french-bread bagels - YUM)!  Before our entrees were served, two of us received salads.  One guy ordered a Caesar salad and I subbed out my Caesar for a house salad with ranch on the side.  The house salad consisted of spring mix with a few thinly sliced cucumber half moons, about four cherry tomatoes that were halved, and a few strips of red and yellow bell peppers.  It wasn't great.  I can't vouch for the Caesar salad, but the dude told me that it was \"too spicy.\"  He wasn't referencing hotness, but said that there was too much garlic.  Our entrees arrived and looked palatable, but not as appetizing as I would expect a $25.00 entree to look.  I ordered a prime rib, because the waitress said they were \"known for our prime rib,\" so I had to check it out, as did two others in my party.  The remaining two ordered the sirloin special.  I ordered an end-cut, because I enjoy my prime rib medium, leaner, and in my experience, end-cuts seem to have more seasoning.  The waitress said I didn't really have to worry about that, because their prime rib was really lean, anyway.  Well, the huge chunks of fat and gristle on my plate beg to differ.  Yuck.  My entree was also accompanied by a baked potato, mixed vegetables, and mushrooms.  The baked potato was so overcooked that the outside was inedible and the inside was so dehydrated that it looked like my potato was empty.  I nearly asked my waitress for a flashlight to go hunting for my potato, until I saw what appeared to be chives peeking through the cave of what once was a happy Idaho spud.  Now, the mixed veggies.  Oh, the mixed veggies.  *sigh*    I take some responsibility for this.  I should have asked what exactly \"mixed vegetables\" consisted of.  It was my fault to ASSume that it would be either your typical California blend or something similar.  The mixed vegetables consisted of bell pepper slices with bits of red onion and snap peas.  I can't really tell how they were cooked because they were kinda mushy, yet some were crunchy.  They were oily, but not oily enough to have been exclusively cooked in oil.  In any event, they were gross.  Also, the mushrooms that came with my meal weren't anything spectacular: boiled button mushrooms.  Big whoop.  At the end, I brought home over half my meal (though the waitress didn't pack up my baked potato), as did my mother, so my father had a bonanza when we got home (he had other plans so didn't get to go out with us, lucky him).  After reading all of the stellar reviews, and having already visited this place, I'm not really sure why this place is getting raved about.  The food is okay, not great.  They did a good job of cooking the meat to order, particularly our prime rib orders, but the seasoning is a little blah (it leaves a weird aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on... maybe I don't want to...), the baked potato and veggies were subpar (one of the guests said his twice-baked potato was pretty good, as did another say the mashed potatoes weren't terrible), and the mushrooms were bland.  It must be the ambiance and atmosphere that sells this place, because you could get the same meal at Outback for half the price and the food is relatively comparable, with Outback having better salads and mushrooms and The Keg having better bread.",

The ambiance is calming and romantic, dim lighting with a giant fire and professionally clad waiters, it's almost always booming yet never all that loud. I've had a lot of their menu over the years and still haven't found something I didn't like. Their prime ribs are incredible. Get it rare and just let all that wonderful juice run down your chin... they also have huge potatoes plus some great appetizers like the tempura asparagus, scallops and bacon and escargot. The only thing really lacking here is the beer selection, just the basics around The Keg. But with dynamite service, dishes you'll be licking clean, and an atmosphere that'll put you in the mood, The Keg earns an easy four stars.",

    "text": "Great place!  Took a little work to figure out getting a reso but when I did everything was smooth sailing.  They took great care of my kid ( bonus points duh) BUT we were smart enough to make my reso early to be the first turn.  Food was great, wine pairing (my choice) was great. Take advantage of the Cammeron Hughes selection - I didn't know that was available until too late but I did not feel bad about the Bella Glos selection at all.  We will be back, we will request the same table, very easy nice outing for a celebration...",

The server made a mistake with an entree and he automatically comped it without us asking or fussing. That's service. The food is pretty good too and the prices very reasonable.",

Even when she was swamped with other tables and orders, she still came to our table in timely manors to check up on us. Great service = loyal customers",

    "text": "The Keg was the best dining experience my date and I have had in a very long time. We had been here a few times before but the service was out of this world this time. I had the Alaskan crab legs with garlic mashed potatoes and my date the New York strip and twice baked potato. His was cooked exactly how he likes and my crab legs were perfection. Our server Tyler was knowledgable about wine suggestions and was a pleasure to chat with. Ashley the manager was great as well and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. We will be back many times in the future!!!",

    "text": "We read all of the Yelp reviews, and also received good recommendations from friends for The Keg. The week before we  had dinner at Mastros and Modern Steak, both of which were amazing. The Keg...terrible. I had the BBQ chicken & ribs. They were very very dry and when they came out it looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. The ribs were super tough and hard to get off the bone. Taste was awful. My girlfriend had their filet on the special menu. She managed a steak restaurant so she definitely knows how to order...so she requested medium rare \"plus\" (between medium rare & medium). The waiter said they had an \"alarming\" amount of people send their steak back when ordering something special like a plus, so he encouraged her to go with medium rare. The only thing alarming was how undercooked the steak was. Beyond rare. Cold in the center, not even a little bit close to medium rare. The steak didn't have very good taste at all. The best thing we had was the twice baked potato. Also, it's funny that they call this restaurant The Keg and they only have like 6 beers on tap, no microbrews or interesting beers. In summary, if you are looking to have a really nice dinner and spend $20-35 per plate, I think there are MUCH better restaurants (Modern Steak was great...and can't compare it to Mastros since that's in a league of their own). Hope this is helpful...",
