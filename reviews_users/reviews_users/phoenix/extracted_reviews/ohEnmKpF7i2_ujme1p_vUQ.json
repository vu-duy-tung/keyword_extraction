This is my first time here and it's early so it's not crowded yet but it smells wonderful inside the diner room. I was seated right away and the waitress came and went over the menu with me she had a good knowledge of the menu which is nice. I have had English food in the pubs in London and all over England so we'll see how this meets English standards.  OMG my lunch was so good!!!!!!!.my pastry melted in my mouth.  It was filled to the brim with steak potatoes  and mushrooms.   Will i be back? yes,yes,yes",

When that warm pocket of goodness arrives at your table, you know you made the right choice for your meal. You can even take one to go and finish cooking your pasty at home.

The second round was definitely a mojito, it had basil swimming in it, I told our waitress and she looked at me like I was nuts. There's no basil listed in the drink ingredients on the menu. I didn't freak out but found it odd that two different bartenders would have that drastic of a take on one specialty drink. Either way we'll be back. The food is amazing.",

Basically the food here is great, everything else is not.  a \"pasty\", apparently, is a shepherd's pie (or any other one of the 40 variations on a meat pie), which definitely is tasty.  Each pie I'd say is worth about $6 - $7, average price is 9.50, so a bit overpriced.  Scantily dressed, grumpy waitresses, references to beer and beer mugs everywhere, and extremely loud music that makes it hard to hear or be heard.    Basically, it's the perfect place to go if you're still in that teeny-bopper 20'ish stage, and mostly for an all-male crowd.  I wouldn't wander in here with kids, even though I did see one couple braving it with a 3 year old; they looked visibly uncomfortable.",

And this restaurant serves up an amazing cornish pasty.  It also doesn't hurt that Cornish Pasty Company has an authentic british pub ambiance.  I had the Oggie, which is a pretty traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes and onion.  Give it a minute before taking your first bite.  Trust me when I say it comes to the table piping hot.  For just $8.50, it's a pretty good little meal.  Need more?  There are some good sides and salads for about $2 to $5.  The beer selection (tap and draft) is awesome.  I did not partake in dessert, but what I saw at other tables looked amazing.",

Their food is second to none and I always bring out of town visitors to Tempe and they love it.   Well first time making it to the Mesa location. Really nice building, I see they still have the long bench settings but the overall restaurant appeared bigger and more open. Still same great food. My personal favorite is the Meat and Cheese and I usually try to take a bite or two from my wife who usual orders the pilgrim or Italian. All are great!!!  Good service as well, I forget our server name, but she was very nice and food came put prompt and was very attentive to our party.   Overall a good addition to the Cornish Pasty restaurants. I can't wait till I get a chance to checkout the scottsdale location next so I can complete my Cornish Pasty visits.",

The wait guy finally said \"Would you like me to tell you all the ones we're out of?\" It's 6:45 p.m. on a Friday and you're out of a bunch of pasties? Who's doing your forecasting? I'm so annoyed at playing Guess What Pasty We Have? I'm just getting an appetizer. I've always sung your praises but really, get your shit together. The place is packed so it doesn't matter if you lose our frequent patronage (several times a month with my group of buddies), but keep it up and your business may eventually suffer.

I have been a frequent visitor of this establishment since its very humble beginnings in Tempe where they were so tiny and you had to wait for a chance open spot at the bar. They have since expanded the original location in Tempe and opened two more locations in Mesa and Scottsdale.   I tend to frequent the Mesa location due to its location and convenience for me. There is a bigger hipster college crowd in Tempe, and a great place to be as well.  My mainstay is a cup of tomato soup, which is unlike any around. I have been disappointed with many restaurants tomato soup, but this one never disappoints. It comes with a couple slices of bread and real butter.   I then order any number of pasty's, and I must say I have never met a one I didn't like. The Rosemary Chicken is always a great bet, they also offer many pasty's as vegetarian options, and have a vegan pasty of the day, just ask.  The beer selection is the bomb, and you can't beat $3.00 Irish Car Bombs all day everyday.  A great place to bring your out of townies and family, as well as make it a weekly stop for yourself.",

I turned vegan 4 years ago and they have an extensive vegetarian menu with 2 vegan pasties on offer daily (usually... they've let me down a couple of times but I just switch to vegetarin for the meal - don't judge).   Alcohol is great too with Strongbow on tap and specials always running. I bring my parents here when they visit too and they love it - they're from Cornwall, which should tell you everything you need to know.

The service was only so so but the pasties are so good that I will give them a pass on service at least for now. We were originally seated in an area of the patio outside which we were told by the hostess, used to be a smoking area but they had recently turned it into a non smoking area. We really wanted to sit outside on this beautiful evening so we put up with the lingering smoky aroma and ash trays that were sitting on the table next to us. After we had ordered drinks, the table behind us proceeded to light up a cig. We were not to fond of this since we were told by the hostess that this was now a non smoking area. We decided to move tables since we observed that another nearby table, outside of the \"smoking\" area. We did inform our waitress of the move before we officially made it. I know that this is not necessarily the best thing to do in a restaurant setting because of the set up of waiter/ess per table or area but since we were mislead into believing that we were seated in a non smoking area, we felt it necessary to move.  Anyhow, our waitress did not seem to fond of the fact that we had moved and she rudely made the comment to us that and I quote \"THAT IS THE SMOKING AREA\" well I am sorry miss lady! We were told it was non smoking!! I would rather not be around cigarette smoke during my delicious pasty meal. I ended up ordering some Cornish coleslaw to start which was fantastic. It does have a fair amount of raw red onions in it, so be aware if you are ordering it on a date or a lunch break. It is more of savory coleslaw rather than sweet with hints of horseradish. I ordered the bangers and mash pasty. It was absolutely delicious! They do make their own sage sausage in house and it is oh so good! Mashed potatoes and sausage with a sage sausage gravy, YUM!! My sister had the chicken pot pie pasty and was equally impressed.  Overall the food is delicious. I have had many a pasty in England and these area equally as good if not better to some that I have had in around various cities in England. The service is hit or miss. I will be back for more because I love the food!",

We served the Cajun, Shepard's Pie, Oggie, and Veggie Oggie for dinner and for the cocktail hour there were tandoori wings and Scottish eggs.

Although the pastry seems  pre-made and frozen, heated on the spot, it is generally tasty. Prices are quite reasonable. Main concern our past two visits has been the poor service. Our last two visits we were seated just outside the restroom against a wall in a dark area, but candlelit. Our server apparently either forgot about us or had to many tables to serve as we waited 15 minutes the first time and on our last visit decided to leave after 15 minutes. Too bad as we had liked this local eatery.",

I guess we've been married long enough that if he tells me I'll like something, I believe him.  So we took our youngest and headed over there with the intention of getting two pasties and an order of chips. Abby chose the Royale (cheeseburger). I was flummoxed. I couldn't decide between the Mexican, Rosemary Chicken or Salmon. The server helped me out and I ordered salmon. Everything was amazing. The best thing about it was that this doesn't seem to be one of those places where you order the same thing every time. I can't wait to try a wide variety of pasties.  We sat along the bar by the kitchen and chatted with the chefs, demanding to know what each pasty was as they cut it open and we could see inside. They were charming, full of information and never acted put-upon. The service was also terrific. I'd go back in a heartbeat.  The one caution I'd offer is that everything is served \"as is\" - you can't make any changes if you, say, don't like mushrooms or what-have-you.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty Company 1941 W. Guadalupe Road Mesa, Arizona  We arrived on a Friday night at 6:00 as a party of 14. Probably not the most fair thing to do since I knew I was going to review the restaurant, yet it didn't phase them in the least. While they take no reservations, they treated us courteously, and seated us after a short wait.  This is not the quietest place to eat at, as a lot of it has to do with the bar, which is very conducive to friendly chit chat, but overlooking that, it's quite a charming place. There is seating outside, as well as in church pews inside, which makes for a cozy atmosphere as well as the possibility of having new conversations with people you have never met - something that Americans are not used to, but is very common in the rest of the world.  Everyone ordered soft drinks except for myself. I ordered a Strongbow to see if it was what I remembered from the U.K., and it was no different at all. A True hard cider with good flavor of apples.  For my main course, I ordered the Oggie, a mixture of steak, potato, onion and rutabaga, served in a pastry crust with a small cruet of red wine gravy. ($8.00) . I was instantly transported back to the U.K. with my first bite. It had great depth of flavor, and the red wine sauce was absolute dynamite. An excellent dish! I also ordered a side of Mushy Peas ($2.75) and a side of Baked Beans ($2.50). The peas had nice flavor and were exactly as served in England, but I didn't care for the Baked Beans. There seemed to be an odd flavor associated with them that was off putting and which everyone agreed was not very tasty.   Other members of our party ordered the Italian, the Porky (pronounced as orgasmic), the Shepherds Pie, the Reuben (good corned beef), the Chicken Greek (said to be very tasty), and the Lamb Vindaloo (usually very spicy, but apparently toned down here for American palates). Two of our party ordered the Pilgrim, which is roasted turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and red wine gravy. One pronounced it terrific, while the other didn't care for it.  The menu also includes a nice assortment of vegetarian dishes as well.  Most people didn't have room for dessert, but a few did, with almost everyone sharing. One of the desserts was Banoffee Pie - a graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, whipped cream and fresh bananas. It was interesting to note that the whipped cream was unsweetened. When mixed with the other ingredients, it picked up it's sweetness from them and tended to tone down the overall sweetness of the dish - a wonderful idea of what would otherwise have been an overly sweet dessert.  The other dessert that was ordered was the Apple Caramel Pasty - a kind of apple turnover pie crammed full of apples and cinnamon and covered with a homemade caramel sauce and served with a large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. Nothing could have been better, especially since the caramel wasn't too sweet.  Considering how crowded the place was, service was not too bad, and certainly could have been a lot worse.  Perhaps the only fault I could find was with the ladies room. The paper bin was full to the top, and the rolls of paper were scattered around instead of being in holders. I have been in nicer restrooms in other restaurants.  Overall, this was a wonderful eating experience, with several authentic dishes on the menu as well as some creative ones. I recommend it highly and give it 4 stars.",

The RUDE bald bartender was such a tool. He was annoyed that I told him its my first time there and asked him what was good on the menu. His rude response was that the one time he told someone what was good on the menu, they sent it back, so he doesn't do that anymore, and then literally walked away! I wanted to throw up when I saw and heard him rushing to flirt with some girls right next to us within ear shot. So unprofessional! What a complete douchebag!!  I got my food 50 min later and the bartender just made the experience worse! I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS LOW CLASS PLACE WHO CANT EVEN HIRE A PROFESSIONAL BARTENDER!

It includes pool and darts. It turns the whole spot into more of a pub you could hang out and have a beer at, rather than just a dinner spot.  Food is still excellent. Location can be kind of messy at times. Wait times are not quick, but are reasonable. Customer service is average. I took away a star for the negative points in this paragraph.

Take flavorful meat, cheese, unique vegetable combinations, wrap it up in a flakey pastry, then bake it until hot inside and crispy outside.  Serve it up with a side dipping sauce, it doesn't get much better. While your waiting  for your delicious entree, take advantage of the great beer selection the Cornish Pastry Company has to offer.  Sip on a ice cold draft from a great selection while your delicious entree is baking.    The Cornish Pastry Company has a great atmosphere, very casual and comfortable.

The food was delicious however, the waitress took forever to take our order, I had to literally find her and tell her we were ready to order our lunch after twenty minutes. SMH. Then, after we we're done I flagged her down and told her we we're ready for the check. I told her jokingly please, take this bill now before you disappear and her response was I can't help it I have to many (six) tables. I kept quiet, but whatever happened to great Customer Service!!!!!!! It's a lost art.",

It was hard to choose because everything sounded so delicious! I ended up ordering the portobello chicken while my boyfriend ordered the lamb and mint. The portobello chicken's combination of flavors was excellent! It went so well with its side of marinara sauce. Lamb and mint was okay. We both definitely preferred the portobello chicken. The pie itself was yummy. I'd love to come back and try more of their pasties.  Side note: If you didn't know like me, this \"pasty\" is pronounced \"pas-tee\", not \"pey-stee\". They're two totally different meanings and you don't want to get funny looks when you're trying to order.",

    "text": "I need to update my review of this place badly.  I LOVE Cornish Pasty Company!  My only complaint is that there isn't one in Tucson yet.  YET!  A girl can dream.... but for right now I have to be happy that my husband will bring me one every time he goes to Phoenix to see his family, that I get them anytime I am in Phoenix, and that on my way to and from Pine, I can have a pasty.  I still love the decor, and the vibe this place gives off.  Punk rock music, candles in liquor bottles, large, wooden tables that sometimes need to be shared with other groups.  The service CAN be a little slow at times, but I attribute this to the fact that they have to bake your pasty when you order it, which is not the quickest thing ever.  I know exactly how long it takes, because when my husband brings them home, he asks to get them raw so we can bake them in our own oven.  They have vegetarian and even vegan pastys on top of their delicious meat-filled variety.  I have gotten a tremendous variety of pastys and I have yet to have one that i didn't care for.  I usually go for something vegetarian, but I DID have the Sheppard's Pie one last time and it was amazing.    Cornish Pasty also has a large beer selection along with some ciders which is just delightful.  The servers know what beer I may want and always have helpful suggestions.  I am a big, big fan of Cornish Pasty Company.  It's always fresh and delicious, decent service, fun atmosphere and all at a good price.",

The place was packed but we mananaged to get our drinks and food in a timely manner.   I've gone here a few times since during the day and it's not quite as packed but still busy.

A quick search on yelp found that this was the closest location, and we were off!  We arrived in peak dinner hours, so it was fairly busy.  We offered to sit at the bar if that would be faster, and it was.  It was actually really cool sitting there; we had a view of the prep kitchen and we enjoyed watching everybody work around each other like a well-oiled machine.  Aware of the large portion sizes, the two of us split a salad (it must have been unremarkable, I remember nothing about it) some kind of fries (yummy) and a pasty.  It was called The Pilgrim, or something else Thanksgiving-y, and it had turkey, stuffing, cranberry, sweet potatoes, gravy... your whole Thanksgiving Dinner in each bite!  That was one tasty pasty!  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I found that half was plenty of food.    The atmosphere was lively and busy and I'd definitely recommend planning ahead if you're coming with a group or during a busy time.  Bonus... they have those purse hooks under the bar to keep your stuff off the highly trafficked floor!  It was a fun and yummy time, and I would love to go back to try something else off the menu.",

    "text": "Love, love, love this place! I only wish I had found them sooner, but I seriously can't get enough. I've been here countless times and even as soon as after placing my order I start thinking about the next time I'm going to come and all the amazing pasty creations I want to have.  Everything from the ambiance to the staff to (especially) the food adds to the experience and makes it wonderful. Where to start? How about the ambiance. It is quite dim here, appropriately like mining caves, and the dripping wax candles are the perfect touch to make you feel like you're part of the English history (read about it on the menu).  The wait staff can be described as trendy, but we've had several occasions where they remember us and every single time they are extremely friendly. The manager is also there often and checks in on tables himself to make sure diners are 100-percent satisfied with their visit. Try sitting in different areas of the restaurant to get views of the line prep area; it's quite memorizing to see them remember which orders are which as each pasty basically looks the same coming out of the oven.  Now, the food! I'll start by saying that the food here is salty, but it is seriously out of this world. The oven chips (french fries) are a hit, and usually ordered with the jalapeno topping. The mushy peas are so simple but so warm and comforting; super fresh peas mashed down to the perfect consistency; they even go great as a dip for a pasty. I almost wish I could order a bowl and have it instead of soup. \"Almost\" because you gotta try the soups!  Every soup order is served with killer slices of fresh-baked and thick-cut bread. Dip the bread in the soup or eat it on its own. Either way don't eat too much because it'll fill you up quick and you want to definitely save room for the main event and probably dessert. The red pepper and black bean soup is nice and spicy, but the cream of leek and potato and the mushroom and walnut soups are favorites too. Order the larger bowl and you'll still be craving every last drop.  There's so much that can be said about the pasty choices here. The pastry dough is perfectly crisp and the pinch on the top or side of the pasty is really one of the best parts; kind of like the crust on a pie or a pizza. My favorite has got to be the Pilgrim, which is basically an entire Thanksgiving dinner in your hand; perfectly balanced with the sweetness from the sweet potatoes, the savory and salty stuffing, and the moist chicken or turkey. However, the list is extensive for the top runners including the Oggie and the salmon. Their sauce sides pair really well with each pasty, but you can swap them out if you've come across a favorite.  After all that if you've got room for dessert, I'd recommend ordering a few for the table and sampling a bit of each for the full experience. The Banoffee Pie, Shirley Temple Pudding, and the caramel apple pasty are incredible but so are the rest.  If you haven't had a pasty before, make this your next \"To Try\" spot. I promise you'll be back for more as the menu is diverse in flavors and there has got to be something for everyone. Even vegetarians can enjoy many of the options since there is a vegetarian pasty section on the menu. It should be noted however that the ingredients in the dishes cannot be altered. Every pasty is premade, \"sealed\", and then cooked off in their oven to order.  Prices are, in my opinion, very fair. They have happy-hour specials on drinks and unique beer selections too. I would even recommend getting take out from here. Your take-out order can be made ready-to-eat or half-baked, meaning you take it home and bake it fresh in your oven.",

Make sure you come hungry and have an empty stomach, these pasties will satisfy your hunger.  I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken which was an Awesome flaky, buttery pastry type crust stuffed with chicken, asiago cheese, black beans, hatch chiles, roasted corn, and tomatoes. The crust was thin, flaky, and buttery that seemed to defy how it could itself together with all those fillings. I appreciate that it wasn't doughy like other types of stuffed pastries, strombollis, calzones, etc. and it seemed to strike the balance between the crust and the fillings.  Although it may be typical for a pasty be aware of any of the ones that have potatoes as part of the filling. I tried their version of the chicken pot pie and my taste buds only remembered the heaviness of starch and more starch with the crust and roasted potatoes and the chicken seemed to be lost in all that.   I was kind of bummed they ran out of oven fries. I was looking forward to that.  Overall, a very unique and delicious experience.",

We sat at the bar and the service was quick (which is surprising for a Saturday night) and the food was AMAZING. I felt a little sad as I was coming to the end of eating my Pasty and could've easily ordered another one for myself. Also, I highly recommend the Cornish Meatballs . So A+++ to Cornish Pasty and our server Kent!!",

    "text": "I normally never give a one star but my experience here last Friday night has left me not wanting to ever go to this location again. The last 2 times has been horrible.  I brought an out of town friends here. My wife  ordered a pasty because she liked the sauce that it came with, she specifically asked the waitress about the sauce that came with the pasty, and the waitress said it was their most popular sauce.  After the pasty's came to the table, I noticed how small they where compared to their tempe location, for almost $10 I normally can  make two meals out of one pasty. Not at the mesa location though, it was also like this last time I went and I thought it was just a one time thing. I was wrong.   Back to the sauce, last time they gave her a half a cup of sauce so she had to ask for more, but they were out so had to make more, which they did, but by the time it got to the table the pasty was cold.   This time, they replaced the sauce with a gravy, and when my wife asked for the other kind they said they were out. They didnt offer to make any more and just gave her a different sauce. I would think if thats the most popular sauce and with over 2 hours left before close they would make some more? Also why didnt the waitress tell her before bringing the food to the table? She would have gotten a different pasty if she knew about the sauce.  Our desert apple pie pasty was cold, with a huge chuck of cold caramel in the middle.   All around a bad experience and I'll never go to this location ever again. I'll be going to the tempe one, but still hesitant after this visit.",

Everything was perfect and the sauce was fantastic!  One of our orders got messed up a bit but we got some freebies on the house that made up for it.  Lots of good draft beer, and even a tasty draft cider I hadn't tried before.  The staff was great, helpful and friendly without being too clingy, and my glass never went empty.

I grew up in Michigan and could not believe when we drove by and the sign said \"Cornish Pasty Co\"!  We had just came from Shakespears English pub (to try the fish and chips), and had to turn around and go back to the Pasty Co.   My mother and I ordered a to go order of \"Oggies\" the traditional pasty they have in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan with steak, rutabaga, onions, and potatoes), we were offered drinks while we waited (we didn't want anything) and went outside to wait.  Us \"downstaters\" or (Trolls-people who live below the Mackinac bridge in MI.)  go to the U.P. on vacation and its always a treat to get these there. The UP'ers eat them with ketchup, I don't care for that.  Service at the Cornish Pasty Co. was great-everyone was very friendly, awesome atmosphere, varied menu for all tastes.  My brother then came in with me after a few minutes to see the place and we were again offered drinks while we waited for our order-very friendly service. We heated the pasties up later at the hotel and they were great.  When I move I will definitely be back, and so will my other family members.",

I can't personally say I'm a huge fan of this place, so I can't give it four stars, but I will say that I will be visiting this place again. The beer selection is really great and the mugs are worth a smile. The atmosphere is \"young and hip\" and reminds me of a Scottish Pub I visited in the past.  The staff is truly nice and trying to be helpful.  Though we went at a weird time because our server changed in the middle. The food though wasn't what I hyped it up to be, perhaps I set the bar too high.  The soup though was totally weird.  My sister and I ordered two soup; one was way too salty and the other was truly bland.  The Pasty itself wasn't bad.  I've never had a pasty and it tasted very well, Pasty.  The taste won't blow you away or cause you to over-eat, but it is fun to eat, and the non traditional pasties are worth trying.  The other thing we ordered was a lemonade.  That was pretty good.  Over all, the atmosphere was pretty good, but judging on food, it was a little better than okay and kind of interesting.  Oh, almost forgot, the food is truly very very filling. We had: Cottage Pie Pasty Lemonade Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty Leek Soup  I went with my mother recently and she totally digs the food, and I found it more memorable than the first time, but the food still didn't blow me away, still, I'll be visiting again.",

After a quick look at the menu we order the Oggie, the peppered steak and the lamb vindaloo. I also was forced to order a pint Guinness. The wait time for the meal was average and the pastys came out nice and hot. We liked the taste of the Oggie, full of flavor and balance. The peppered steak had the best texure, the steak was very tender and pastry just right. The lamb vindaloo was average. It was a little spicy but, the flavor was incomplete. I will have to back and try the lamb and mint next time . All in all a good light dinner and a return visit will be in order.",

BTW, they are pronounced \"past-ee.\"  Don't forget to order dessert! I like the Shirley Temple Pudding or the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding.  Although I am still open to try the other ones, especially their version of the Banoffee Pie (you can't go wrong with bananans, toffee, and cream).  Expect the inside of the place to be loud.  Although we have been there at odd times and it is pretty quiet.  The outside is pretty comfortable, even during summer or in the cold of winter (they have misting systems all over, and powerful, yet comfortable, heaters).  Their service is superb!  The servers friendly and fast.  Oh! Did I mention you can take unbaked pasties to go?!  Seriously!  Give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed. :)",

Church pews as chairs and doors as the tables topped with a lit candle in a Jameson bottle, definitely a winner in style and uniqueness. I typically don't like tomato soup, BUT their cream of tomato soup is a a must every time. I usually get the Cajun chicken pasty as my go-to, although I've tried others and they're also really good. But the Cajun chicken is my favorite. They also have a nice outside seating section that is perfect on a nice Arizona day. Service has always been great.",

These are genuine English comfort foods with amazing twists on the flavors nestled inside each handmade pastry (You can see them being made from the wrap-around bar by the pool tables). Vegan and Vegetarian options ensure everyone in your crowd can find something delicious to eat. My current favorite item is actually the salmon caesar salad. What kind of glaze is happening on that salmon anyway?? Delicious. My neighborhood favorite!",

I'm not sure that's what Cornish Pasty Co had in mind when they opened up. Sure, the place is dark, like a mine. And a lot of the waiters have crazy beards, similar to what the old miners sported. That's where the similarities stop, though. This place is H.I.P. Was mining hip? Probably not.  They have a hundred thousand beers to choose from. And every single pasty I've tried is SO SO SO good. The dessert takes the cake (but it isn't cake). PB&J Pasty, with ice cream on the side! Ooey Gooey peanut butter, jelly and bananas.  The only reason CPC doesn't get the full five stars is the service. It's usually awesome. Every now and then, though, you'll get someone who is too cool for school. That'll ruin it! I still highly recommend this place, though. Amazing food, awesome atmosphere and mostly good service.",

This place was full of them; you'll see a lot of tattooed employees here and general indie-ness abounds at the Cornish Pasty Co. Luckily this also means good music. I heard El Ten Eleven, Minus the Bear, Crystal Castles, and Caribou while eating there. But onto the food!...  CPC has a great variety of pasties. I tried \"The Porky\", which was delicious. Inside it was pork, potatoes, apples, sage, and a few other ingredients. My table also ordered a side of jalapeno fries, which were very good and just the right level of spiciness.  You really can't go wrong with this restaurant. What's not to love about a place that has Strongbow on tap? I would definitely recommend eating here.",

It has a casual outdoor patio, perfect for those who are escaping the winter weather and want to make the most of being in Arizona. Plus, pretty much anyone can find something they like, regardless of the kind of food they are craving, since they have such a wide variety of flavors. They also have an excellent selection of beers.   I decided to finally write this review because we had such a great server - Laurin - on a Sunday evening in March of 2015. She was an absolute sweetheart and gave us just the right amount of attention. We enjoyed a lovely meal, drinks and ambiance as always, and it was made that much better by Laurin's wonderful service.",

    "text": "Read about this place on Yelp. Based on the reviews, we set out to give it a try last week with high expectations. Instead, shock is probably the best word to describe the experience. First impressions upon walking in at 4:45 on a weekday, the place was filthy. Visible crumbs and debris all over the floor, complimented by ceiling fans that are covered in gunk and dirt. One fan missing a blade completely.  Service was horribly slow with a 20 minute wait for drinks.  8 of those minutes, the drinks sat on the bar waiting to be picked up by our waitress. Did not get her name, but a redhead. Later, once the waitress was done socializing with her co-workers behind the bar and finally took our order (10 more minutes) we ordered the Rueben and the Italian because they were out of the first 2 menu items we chose. Both were ok, but nothing to get excited about.  It was a deeply disappointing experience. Between the dirty floors and ceiling fans, to the horribly slow, uncaring service only to be topped off with OK food is the formula that equals - not going back.   Hope management will be able to eye this place from the perspective of a patron and can address these issues",

It can be somewhat hard to identify the staff as they don't have an official uniform, but they do a good job of introducing themselves and making sure you get settled in.   The pasties themselves are to die for, with a wonderfully varied selection of flavors. If you and members of your party are divided on what kind of food to get for dinner, this place is a great compromise because there's an Indian-inspired pasty, a Greek-inspired pasty, an Italian-inspired pasty, an American burger-inspired pasty, and so many more. The number of options and the quality of each one makes this restaurant a great place to split the difference on dinner opinions without giving up a guarantee of a delicious and satisfying meal.

We put in our order for food at 5:50 received appetizers at 6 which was respectable, but it went down hill from there. Our food came out at 6:40. I asked the waitress what happened and she said \"they take a long time to cook.\" This is not my first time at this restraunt just my second time at this location. In Phoenix it takes about 10 to 1w minutes when they are jam pack on a Saturday. So I guess they take longer at this location. Being a server I know that she probably forgot to put in my order... I wish she just would of been straight up with me. Anyway, hopefully next time is better loved the food just received terrible service. 2 stars is based off service the food was great.",

The little guy wanted only ice cream and she offered chocolate chips for a topping. He loved it as he's pretty picky. I got the traditional steak and potatoes pasty which was delicious. I also tried the leek and stilton cheese soup which was served with fresh bread. Also, very good. Not really anything spectacular but all was very good.

    "text": "So my buddy and I have been here twice so far. We've tried the Pilgrim, Rosemary Chicken, Full English Breakfast, and the Chicken Tikka. We both loved the Pilgram best. It's delicious. My friend liked the Chicken Tikka, but it was a little too out there for me. The Rosemary Chicken is good, but not great. And the English Breakfast doesn't work that well in a pasty. The family style/community tables aren't my fave, but tonight we got our own small table and that was better. They do tend to run out of popular pasties, so it's best to get there before 6.   Don't love the punk music, but at least the volume is low enough that it's not too bad. The servers are super nice and helpful. The ambiance is pretty good, dim with candle lighting, which is nice. So a great place to have dinner. The pasties run about $10-$11, which seems fair. Oh, and my friend enjoys their giant Guinness as well. And that about covers it.  Update: On our third visit, we tried the bangers and mash. Hands down our new favorite!",

I ordered the meat and cheese she had the pasta salad , our friends were not hungry i'll say again so I went ahead and ordered oven chips and garlic roasted potatoes and had them put in front of them . My pasty was so moist and so scrumptious I was blown away . Wife had help from our friends finishing hers. As for the oven chips and potatoes they disappeared. Top notch service from Eric the bartender whom was swamped but managed to keep our drinks full our friends happy and me very content as I count on this place when entertaining friends. I'm just sorry I can only give you guys 5 stars. Thx again love Tim and Peggy",

Big disappointment! This place was not very appealing to me at all. I had the bangers and mash. This is what most people talked about in their reviews so I had to try. You can't go wrong with sausage, mashed potatoes, onions, and gravy all wrapped tight in a crispy pastry right? Wrong...I was expecting something way better. It was gooey and mushy and it just didn't have the taste I was expecting. My husband had the Cajun chicken and he wasn't too pleased either. He ate all of his but he never likes wasting food so that's why his was gone before I could even finish my first half. He really liked the sauce that came on the side so I think that was the only plus for him. The only reason I face this place 2 stars instead of 1 was because the pastry was still pretty good. It was nice and crispy and fresh. I wonder if the will just sell me the pastry, that is the only reason I will ever go back.",

Every pasty I've had has always come out hot with a brown flaky crust on the outside and perfectly melded and flavors and ingredients on the inside. My favorite in particular is definitely the bangers and mash; the sausage is packed with great flavors and the mash is always creamy and thick. It's never over seasoned and the red wine gravy compliments it really well. The selection of beers is pretty wide and anyone who likes beer at all can find something they'll love. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about the menus and every time they've suggested something it has been wonderful. The only department they're lacking in is deserts; they're a bit of a let down and much too heavy to compliment the rest of their menu.",

Both kids, 13 & 11, didn't care for their order, a Chicken Pot Pie, and The Pilgrim. We planned to box these up and made lunch the next day of them both. Ambiance of this place was noisy, the seating uncomfortable and dark, the music was blasting too loud to where my GF asked twice to lower the volume.  By the time we were about finished our meals, a group of \"Bohemians\" showed up, occupying the area next to the bar, directly behind out seats. Apparently, these unwashed college aged idiots, smelling of Cigar smoke, from the Cancer Emporium, ie, Cigar store, next door to this restaurant, and body odor, came in loudly talking, swearing, wearing their damn hats to the side, like so many SubUrban Gang Banga, wannabes, ordering shots of some quantity, generally ruining our evening out. Their unpleasant stench, literally gagged the 4 of us, and the unfortunate family that shared our Pew. Pew, what an appropriate term for that time! These morons, finally moved away, thankfully, as I was about to land a size 13 boot, upon someone's ass. I guess, if I was 20-30, and chasing hairy under armed and legged young women, this is the place to be! I'll go back there for the lunch time, never again for dinner.  Overall, the place is painfully in need of a make-over, in caliber of decor, and clientele. Too bad, as the food was exceptional.",

We took our two rueben pasties to go and damn did they hit the spot! They were fantastic! We'll definitely keep going back! Also, I'm not sure how long ago this happened but they expanded. The restaurant is twice the size now. Which is great because now we can try eating there instead of bringing it home.",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty has a very strong English pub atmosphere, accentuated by its industrial stools and wooden benches.  The best way to describe a pasty is a gourmet hot pocket.   The fillings come in all types from traditional lamb and mint to the southwestern influence of chiptole chicken.  I had the lamb and mint pasty, comprised of chunky pieces of lamb, carrots, and potatoes, with the aroma of fresh mint.  This is their specialty.  Another one I tried was their Shepard's pie.  This is a traditional Shepard's pie incased in a flaky crust.  The filling is minced lamb meat with herbs and spices mixed with mashed potatoes.  Each individual ingredient didn't seem all that special, but mixed together, it created a masterpiece in my mouth.  The flavors blended well together.  I also ordered their \"chips\" (french fries for us Americans).  They cut baked potato wedges which are great for the health-conscience people.  It's seasoned with sauteed garlic and parmesan cheese.  The seasoning wasn't too stron.g  It gave the potato a subtle garlic flavor unlike some other restaurant which over-season their fries.    Come to this bloody good restaurant to experience a casual British pub without the price of a plane ticket.",

If we ever have a craving for English food but don't have the time or ingredients to cook it ourselves this is the place to go.  My husband is a picky eater and being American not always a fan of straight up Brit food loves this place as well! I always get the shepherds pie and he usually goes for anything chicken or the Mexican style. I always get the mushy peas and he gets the fries. Just like home! We never end up getting through an entire pasty but it tastes as good reheated in the oven. And let me tell you my husband never eats leftovers and always eat his from here.   The only thing I will say is that we had the pavlova one time and it's just not as good as my moms! Everything else amazing!   All in all if u don't have the money to travel to England want to try the food and experience the English pub life go here! The Brits are not as bland as you think and they will prove it!",

    "text": "After years of obtaining my pastys (I choose to spell it this way, the other makes me feel dirty!) at the Cornish Pasty Co's ASU area location, this new location is a welcome addition to Mesa, and far closer to my home!   First, the restaurant is rather small, but has a large covered patio in case you feel claustrophobic! Inside you'll find large church pews in front of long tables. This is fabulous during busy times, as you'll meet wonderful new people sitting at the other side of your table that you might not have otherwise spoken to!  Menus are on the tables and the candles that sit in empty whiskey bottles are just cool.   On to the food!  My 11-year old daughter adores the PB&J, of course, but so does my 62-year-old mother! I've not tried it yet, but it smells wonderful!   Personally, I've tried the following during my many visits:  -Cheese Steak: Wonderful large chunks of tasty meat with peppers and onions and cheese. The red wine gravy is fantastic with this one, you might need more! -Ruben: The sauerkraut is made from red cabbage, and the corned beef is perfectly cooked. A fabulous choice! -Vegetarian Greek: This was my very first pasty, and was absolutely fabulous. Kalamata olives, artichokes, spinach, sun dried tomatoes,  -Italian: A fabulous concoction served with marinara. Salami makes it tasty, fresh basil leaves put it over the top!  -Chicken Pot Pie: This is the only one I really didn't like... not because it was bad, but because it was bland. It needed salt...  -Greek Salad: This salad is rather interesting, and the dressing is not what I expected! But it's good, and full of lots of good veggies!  You should definitely go here, it's a great place to eat, food pie! Enjoy!",

    "text": "Simply put, Cornish Pasty is AMAZING. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and I could not have asked for a more perfect experience.  The restaurant was dark, with long dark wood booths and candles dripping wax down the empty Jameson bottles. The music was great and the tattooed and pierced staff made me feel right at home.  The table was actually a door with a piece of glass covering it, which was an excellent touch to the atmosphere.  And now, on to the food!  I took my best friend who eats like I do and together we ordered:  Shepard's pie pasty  Chicken tikka masala pasty Lovely bit of salmon pasty Peppered steak pasty Mushy peas Oven chips  The best part is that everything (maybe not the peas) was perfect and distinctly flavored; no dish tasted like any other dish on the table.  I would recommend the chicken tikka masala pasty and the peppered steak pasty if I had to pick two from our table.  After boxing up the leftovers to bring home we ordered dessert; we picked the Strawberry Pavlova and the Apple Carmel pasty. Both were also amazing and with a shared glass of Chardonnay our meal came to a very satisfying end.  I am sad that I had waited so long to visit the Cornish Pasty Co. But it will definitely be a favorite on my list from now on.",

    "text": "Three stars only because our meal took about an hour and 45 minutes from beginning to end.  Our server explained it was because of an extremely large party and only one person being able to work the oven.    We had ordered pea soup and asked for it before the pasties came out.  Our server stopped by to check on drinks (we were each on our second and no soup in sight yet) and said our pasties should be out soon.  We realized she'd totally forgotten about our soup so we flagged her down and asked about it.  She was very nice and apologetic and didn't charge us for the soup, which showed about about 10 minutes later...with our pasties.    Now about the food.  The long-awaited pea soup was well flavored and slightly chunky, with a dollop of cream on top.  Very yummy and delicious when scooped up with the bread and butter served with it.  I had the Lamb Vindaloo Pasty.  The menu said spicy and boy, do they mean it!  I ended up having to scrape a lot of the sauce off the pieces of lamb and potato in order to be able to eat it.  The flavor was great but I couldn't take the heat.  My boyfriend ended up finishing it for me.  My boyfriend wanted the Bangers and Mash Pasty but they were out.  So he had the Rosemary Steak Pasty instead.  It was very good as well.  With the steak, red potatoes, roasted red peppers and brie, it was a hit.  I didn't care for the mustard cream sauce it came with (yes, I stole a couple of bites).    We debated dessert and decided to go for it.  Another wait ensued but it was worth it.  I had the peanut butter and jelly pasty.  Heaven!  With peanut butter, raspberry jelly and banana baked inside, then raspberry sauce drizzled over the top.  Served with whipped cream (the real stuff--not too sweet).  Excellent!  The bf had a sticky toffee pudding that is named after Shirley Temple.  He loved it.  I had a single small bite, knowing that sticky toffee pudding isn't something I enjoy.  This dessert didn't change my mind.  So I can't recommend it but based on my bf's reaction, it must have been good if you are into that sort of thing.  I'll pick another night and try the place again, for certain.  Learned my lesson that a busy Saturday night is not the best.",

The Tempe vibe is that of a hole in the wall NY/SF/Chicago joint and sometimes I can actually take a moment and feel like I'm not in drab AZ.  The Chandler location is new, cleaner but mirrors the same decor, menus and furniture that the Tempe spot has.   For awhile I couldn't get away from the Cajun - this one is my favorite. I've tried the Royale With Cheese and  the Italian.  All of them were good but the cajun, by FAR, rules thus far.  Unfortunately, I have only been to Cornish during my work day, so I haven't been able to wet my whistle with the great beer selection they have.  Plenty of English/Irish style beers to choose from - a decent happy hour too.  The menu also educates you on what a Pasty (PAS-TEE) is. Give it a try!",

A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties (say \"Pass-Tee\"), unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond.  Lunch or dinner will cost you less than $10.00 (without the beer) and the variety is a bit staggering. From the traditional Oggie with beef, onions, potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy, to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice, potatoes, lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying.We have been visiting this hidden wonder for a couple of years now and have tried most of the items on the menu. (Except for the vegetarian pasties which we just have not gotten to yet.) It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!  If you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you. Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch! Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guinness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.  With more room to seat folks, a nice bar/counter, outdoor seating (complete with an area for those that still smoke.) and TWO bathrooms the new Mesa location of the Cornish Pasty Co. is sure to be a huge success.  Take the time to stop by either location of The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again",

The atmosphere is unique which is nice because it helps get you away from the every day franchise restaurant feel. The food is absolutely incredible and their choice of beer is exceptional as well. I highly recommend trying the Pilgrim, Cajun Chicken, and the Chicken Pot Pie. These three Pasty's are definitely my top three favorites. Both the quality of food and service easily makes this place one my of favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area.",

Those are also delicious!   The only negative was that it was sooo packed, we had to wait forever to be seated and get our food.  but hey, with the amazing food they have, its def ok!!!  see you soon CPC! :)",

It looks as though they are expanding.   This is a hip little place and we all decided, \"We'll be back!\"",

And one of the things that I love about it is that every time I go there the place has changed (okay, maybe not every time but at least the last 4 times. This most recent time the bar doubled in size, moved to a different area and they closed up the counter where it used to be. But enough about these paltry things. Here's the important stuff....  1. The girls who work there are beautiful, tattooed, and very nice 2. The beer selection is very good, although i wish they had Newcastle on tap 3. The food is damn tasty (and now they have breakfast pasties (!), which they sadly don't actually serve before 11) 4. The music is some of the best I've heard anywhere in the valley  I've been there probably a couple dozen times and never had anything bad, or even not-awesome. Sadly I don't go there as much anymore since i moved into Phx but the new booths look inviting so I will definitely be back. My lunch buddy/BFF said it's going to be her first meal when she comes back from Asia, carbombs and Mexicans. Sounds like a damn fine plan to me",

The meat and cheese pasty and the chicken pot pie pasty were especially tasty.  The atmosphere was what I would imagine a pub to be!  The reason for the 4 rating was because of the service!   We seemed to wait forever for the food , and the waitresses seemed to disappear for long stretches.  The first waitress we had was bitchy, but the second one seemed sweet!  We eat out a lot and know good service - this was not it!  The person from the kitchen that brought our chips did apologize for the wait.  It even took long for drink refills!  Too bad because the food was great!",

The roasted new potatoes are my favorite accompaniment and they've got a good beer list, too. Tons of free parking, late-ish hours, and decent service.",

The prices are good, the teas are good, and it's just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt. Every friend I've brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal.

I've always eaten outside before, and had I never done inside, this would have been a five-star review.  However, the last time I went,  it was so hot out that we decided to eat inside.  I sat at the bar area where you could see the kitchen.  The floor appears to have NEVER been cleaned, there was garbage everywhere, and I watched employees scraping food leftovers, crumbs, etc. onto the floor and leaving it there.  I also observed an employee with bare hands reach into a bucket that was setting on a cart and toss a handful of some kind of meat from the bucket onto a salad.  The bucket was not refrigerated and had sat there for who knows how long.  I was so appalled that not only did we not order any food, we actually left our alcohol behind.  The glass ware was dirty, the silverware was filthy, and the place was just an outright mess.  I have to give 2 stars at least because I know the food tastes really good, but I'd never be able to eat here again after seeing these conditions.  The owner should be seriously ashamed.",

When you add that plus a great happy hour, life is good. If you just want to get your drink on after a long day at the office, Cornish is hard to beat. If you want to drink AND eat (two of the best things a person can do) you will have an evening to remember. I'm vegetarian and this place has a ton of options for me. The Veggie Oggie and The Greek are my favorites--make sure you get a side of HP if they have it. You won't regret it. As long as this place is open, my husband and I will be frequent visitors.",

    "text": "A great place for lunch, dinner, drinks, whatever. I recently took my partner here for her birthday dinner, and we were both pleasantly surprised. We went around 7pm on a Sunday and it was pretty busy, so we ended up sitting at a high-top outside. Our server was attentive, but not pushy, and refilled our drinks without having being asked. For starters I got the cream of potato, leek and stilton soup. Be forewarned, if you're not used to the stronger cheese you may not like this soup! personally, I loved it. It had a bite and was served with crusty bread and butter. We shared the Oggie and the Lamb Vindaloo pasties, and both were fantastic. The Lamb Vindaloo has a great kick, and actually made my nose run. Both the lamb and the beef in the pasties were tender, and the red wine gravy that came with the Oggie was great! For dessert we got the Shirley Temple Pudding. If you've never had it before, be aware that it doesn't have the consistency of pudding like you're used to. It's almost like chocolate malt-o-meal, but doesn't really taste like it. It's chocolatey, sticky, warm and amazing! the creme anglaise adds an interesting texture to it.   If there's only a few people in your party, you may end up sharing a table/booth with strangers, that could be the only downside. Some people love that kind of atmosphere, some people aren't keen on sharing space with people they don't know.   The price was right. Sunday is happy hour all day, but we didn't drink. But for 3 of us, 2 soup appetizers, 3 sodas, 3 pasties and a dessert it came up to just over $40.   We'll definitely be back!",

Our server Tony had a trainee with him and both of them were very charming.  When our food was coming out, Tony explained that there had been some confusion in the back and that my friend's Rosemary Chicken would be delayed but in the meantime would we all love to munch on a portabello mushroom with red sauce, cheese, etc, and they were insanely apologetic and said in addition to the substitute pasty, her original would be free of charge.  The manager came over to apologize as well and they were so nice we almost felt bad them THEM.  The food was fantastic just as it has been every other time I've eaten here or at their other location.  This time the charming \"Tony\"  turned the mistake into a great positive as we got to try a new pasty and got to see some awesome customer service (and training of customer service).  The way they handled it was top notch..we wouldn't have even expected TWO freebies, much less ONE since we really didn't have to wait that long to receive the correct order.  Really can't recommend this place enough, and haven't had a pasty I didn't like.",

At first glance it didn't look like it'd fill me up but I was surprised... the meat and stuff is packed pretty dense so it works.  The bread is really tasty and crusty but not too dry.  The beers were like $6 a pop and for two of us it was $30 before tip...  I'll go back... was pretty good... lots of other pasties to try on the menu",

The Tikki Masala has a bit of spice to it that I was not up for at the moment, but both of the other dishes were very flavorful and so filling! The atmosphere is great too! Such a cool place!",

A friend thought he got the wrong beer, so the waiter/trainer sampled it. That's right, he drank out of a customer's glass. I asked the bartender if I could speak to a mgr, she looked confused and said sure. Some dude came out acting like a manager. Food isn't bad, happy hour isn't good, service is horrible; expect every drink to go empty and to tell your waiter you're ready to order. Do not expect attractive waiters/waitresses, however, you can expect a poorly dressed, unattractive hipster bring this attitude into their service.",

You need to have someone at the front door at all times...Or at least a sign that says seat yourself.  Sat at the table for 10 minutes. No acknowledgement. No menus. Just a Jamison candle bottle that we played with. Had to ask some random person sweeping if she had menus. Really? Another 10 minutes, what would you like for a drink? Are you our waitress? I don't know if your another sweeper or somebody else playing a joke on us. Acknowledge your table!! How difficult is that? Training of the employees has got to be number one and sadly its the food number one. Bummer.  Maybe it was just a Sunday afternoon kind of thing, but our waitress could care less. First time in here? Thanks for coming back! No questions, no nothing. At least ask my wife...  I really like the food but it does nothing for me when you can't get simple service right. We will not be back. We've had friends that have been there in the last two-3 months and say the same thing. Food is great. Service is horrible. It's not just me saying this.   Fix some things and care a little bit more about your diners...I hope you make it to the 5 year mark. I'm willing to try again but it's got to be better on the 3rd time otherwise your a waste of time.  Two starts cause the food is actually good. -2 cause of the 19 year old waitresses with their junk hanging out of their bras.",

    "text": "Very eclectic/hipster vibe the minute that you walk through the door and into the almost occult darkness which bathes every inch of the interior; think english church meets gastropub. The menu has been upgraded and is amazing; other than the well rounded english style appetizers, their main menu is based around english pasties, think really hearty hot pockets!!!! In addition to the food, I shouldn't forget to mention that they have an extremely well rounded beer and wine list; I am a beer snob and I am pleasantly surprised at all of my options!!! This is the perfect date night spot due to the fact that the food comes to the table a bit hot; remember when you ate the hot pocket fresh from the microwave?? Yeah, not smart, you will burn your tongue; so one must be cautious and allow the pasty time to cool while sitting in front of you. This would be a good time to discuss the topics of the day, or anything else that might get your mind away from the tasty smell emanating from the plate in front of your nose. Afterwards, the dessert is just as amazing as the main course; and just as unique. Tip: GET THE BANOFFEE PIE, this is as close to crack as dessert will ever get!!! If you have never been to this place, it is because the owner prides himself on the fact that the popularity is based solely on word of mouth!! The place is packed regularly and he doesn't advertise; this is because the food is the real deal.",

We also tried the apple pie pasty type dessert ~ also sooo heavenly even if you're stuffed from the dinner portion :)  Great place to go for a date night out or with friends!

I would say that the staff seem like hipsters, but they're all really friendly and helpful.  They have pretty good drink specials, and their hibiscus tea is mighty tastey!  PS.

A Cornish Pasty is basically a large pastry filled with meats and cheeses usually accompanied by a cold, refreshing beer. Reminds me a lot of my European study abroad. Sometimes, during the Arizona summers, I feel like the food is overwhelmingly heavy.  I actually like the beers and ciders better than the actual food.

The apple caramel desert was awesome. Maybe some people would give it a 4 because of the wait but I appreciate the effort the waiter took to make our experience great.

So when I met up with friends here a couple months ago I was surprised that they had so much more space than they used to. Even though they keep expanding their locations and opening new ones, the food at Cornish Pasty Co has remained consistently good. The four of us ordered four different pasties and asked them to cut them in fourths so we could each try all four. Everyone agreed that they were all delicious. I have been slowly eating my way thru the menu and I have never tasted one that I didn't like. Our service that night was also great and the food came out quickly. I have no complaints.",

The last two times I have got it it hasn't been as good as the first time I got it. One time the caramel was all runny and the last time I got it the whip cream had a weird taste and was just strange. It's disappointing because I crave it and look forward to being able to dig into it. I wish it was consist and delicious every time. I hate having to wonder if I'm going to be disappointed.

I asked if I could of have it minus the mushrooms, they said no because the pasties are all pre-made.  No worries, just a heads up you get what's on the menu.  They had a Chai Cider on special for $3, it was really good!!  My Royale with Cheese was basically a cheese burger and fries wrapped up and baked into a pasty, it was delicious and I didn't even taste the mushrooms lol.  I was actually hesitant on coming here because I'm not one for calzones, and the menu just seemed heavy, but I was taken back on how yummy it was.  I'll be back and bring the wife, they had a ton of vegetarian options.",

For to go dinner they also add directions on how to finish cooking it at home. So you can eat it fresh at a later time. The deserts we had were delicious and huge!

    "text": "You name it and you will most likely find that Cornish Pasty wraps it in a buttery wrap and bakes it. I ordered a catering order by recommendation from peers and man was it good. They're extensive menu lists a wide variety of pasties that are large and chock full of meats, veggies, and cheeses. There isn't one pasty that would leave anyone out from dining there. Flaky and buttery, you'll these pasties are piping hot and mouthwatering.   Here is the history as posted on their website and how they came about. \"The Cornish Pasty originates from Cornwall (Southwest England) and can be traced back as far as the 1200's. Mining was once a thriving industry in Cornwall and at that time pasties were baked by the wives and mothers of the tine miners. Pastis were made with a thick crimped edge along one side so the miners could use the crimp as a handle to hold on to while eating. The miners hand would often be covered in arsenic from the mine, so the miners would discard the handle when they were done. The crusts were never wasted though, as many miners believed that ghosts, or 'knockers', inhabited the mines, and the leftover crusts would keep these ghosts content. Traditionally, pasties were made with different fillings at each end. One end containing meat and vegetables, and one end with a sweet filling. The sweet end would be marked with an initial so the miners knew what side to eat first. Today, Cornish pasties are filled with steak, potatoes, swede (rutabaga) and onions. At one time Cornwall had nearly 2000 flourishing tin mines, but by the 1880's tin mining had become a rapidly declining industry. At this time, Cornish miners began emigrating to Michigan's Upper Peninsular for copper mining bringing pasties with them.\"    Their signature, premium, and vegetarian pasties provide a multitude of flavor combos from light to heavy. They also offer sides and soups. The interior is rustic and a bit dark but matches the pub feel and the staff are friendly and passionate about putting out a quality product.",

The Pasty selection is diverse and long, making you just want to come back repeatedly to try different things. I had the Chipotle Chicken Pasty, which was over-the-top excellent! Highly recommended. There are many different ethnic food types stuffed into any Pasty, so whether you're in the mood for traditional British ingredients or if you're a fan of Greek food, they have a Pasty for you.  Service was great, attentive but not annoying. The waiter had great suggestions for a main course and even dessert. The PB&J dessert pasty is large enough to share, and can come with ice cream. It's something that sounds weird at first, but tastes like it goes perfectly together. You have to try this place!",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty Company has been on our bookmark list for many years now. And thanks to multiple locations, we were finally able to give them a try.  Honestly, despite being raised by an incredibly British mother, I've never been a big fan of British cuisine. Chocolate? Yes. Food itself? Not really. But what's cool about Cornish is that, if you're not into the traditional meat/potato combinations, there's multiple alternatives available. Whatever you like, you're bound to find something that will work for you.  The restaurant itself definitely has a British pub feel to it, with its heavy wood and overall dark and dingy feeling. I was half expecting to see a fistfight breakout between two blokes arguing over their favorite football teams - and I don't mean the NFL.  We started with the scotch egg, which was far superior in quality to what I've had in the past. I opted for the Italian Pasty, which doesn't appear to be a common choice based on Yelp pictures. It consists of various meats and mozzarella, so I guess you could say it's somewhat similar to a heavily packed calzone. My girlfriend chose The Pilgrim, which includes turkey, onions, potatoes and stuffing. It's served with a side of cranberry sauce and some surprisingly high-quality gravy. Both pasties were excellent, using great-tasting ingredients that were wrapped in a fluffy and fresh shortcrust. In the end, we were both very impressed!  For dessert, despite all the online recommendations for the banoffee pie, we decided to go with the chocolate bread and butter pudding. This was excellent, having a nice, crispy outershell, while managing to be incredibly moist on the inside. The brandy flavoring was subtle enough to where it wasn't overpowering. It far exceeds many other desserts at its price point.  So, why not a perfect five stars?   It's simple. We were uncomfortable the whole time. Like another reviewer mentioned, the place is incredibly hot, to the point where you end up feeling all gross and sweaty. Another review I saw revealed that their AC was out on one side the building, but they were continuing to seat people as if nothing was wrong. Yeah, perhaps a warning would be nice. No one wants to eat their pasties in a freaking sauna!  If you read the Yelp reviews, you'll see that most complaints stem from the shoddy service. Servers can be very slow and scattered about. No one really checked on us, so if we needed something, we usually had to struggle to get someone's attention. But they're clearly very successful, so I don't see them having the desire to improve in this area anytime soon.   Overall, food wise, we were quite pleased with the offerings here and will definitely be returning in the future to try some of the other pasties available.",

I went with a bunch of coworkers during lunch.. our server came up and told us they were out of almost half their menu, so that kind of sucked.   I ordered the Oggie, and oven chips with cheddar cheese. I also split a Chicken Pot Pie pasty- this was my favorite.  Portions for the pasty aren't huge, but definitely a good idea to pick two and share.   Oven chips are more then enough for two people to share, I ordered it with cheddar cheese, but you can get it with jalapenos or garlic, or everything as well.   Service was a bit slow for my liking, especially since when we went there were not many customers. Overall a good place for a pasty, try it out!",

Let me repeat the FOOD IS AMAZING THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  ~Tonight we showed up at 550, waited 62 mins to get our order taken. Left after having nothing but water and when I asked to get my order taken the waitress got displeased because she had to \"count waters\" or something. I've never had a single complaint for this place but NEVER show up for a party if there's more then 15 people. They gave us one waitress which was sad because they shouldn't have shirked that responsibly on her. I've just never sat somewhere for an hour just to wait to get my food order taken then had to leave because I'm hangry and sick of staring down the waitress for over an hour everytime she walked by the table. not to mention I showed up with my grandparents so she was cool with letting some 70 year olds sit on a wooden bench for almost 70 mins with just water, and no apologies.  Great. This was comparable to torture. Went to salad and go for dinner, that was good. Pretty displeased about this whole thing. It would have helped if the waitress was nice or understanding that were starving and she wouldn't take our food order.",

The Cajun chicken was good as usual with a small amount of heat and some smoky saltiness coming from the ham and seasonings. Dessert seems like a total after thought but I ordered some chocolate bread pudding anyway and it was pretty meh. It wasn't heated all the way through and there were still a couple flecks of tin foil clinging on to the bread pudding when it hit our table. I saw the cook unwrapping the tin foil off of the cold bread pudding, not sure if tin foil is the right move here, maybe they should plastic wrap them for better holding. The staff here seems pretty cool and service is good but I think the cooks could benefit from some better training, I'm not expecting fine dining here but I also would love for my bread pudding to be warmed through at the very least. All in all, the Mesa Cornish Pasty is not bad but it's not without its downfalls and a few small improvements would put it on par with the others I have been to.",

Pasties are essentially large and far superior Hot Pockets filled with any number of options. My fellow diners chose the Carne Adovada with a spicy filling. I opted for the Peppered Steak with tender beef combined with Stilton cheese and vegetables in a pepper gravy. The combination was extremely delicious.  We shared a dessert similar to the southern banana pudding which was just OK. Service was slow on an otherwise slow night, but the food was worth it.

They don't appreciate a large group on a Friday night, even when you tell them in advance you're coming. Unfortunately at first the service was so slow some of the party-goers had to leave. At my table (we took 3), it went fairly quickly. However the server said he couldn't separate checks, but WE could separate them ourselves at the end and he would ring up as many different cards as needed. So basically he wanted us to do his job.   On the food side- yum! I had the salmon pasty, and it was really good. Though I was expecting a little more to it for the price, it was still filling. The salads were pretty good size. This is why I give it three stars, the food is really good. I would come back, but maybe for lunch when it's a different atmosphere. Husband said he wouldn't, but he's not into the bar scene and he didn't like the smoking out on the patio. I didn't see anyone smoking, but he said he could smell it.",

Sometimes it does take a while to get recognized by a waiter or waitress, but that may also be because it is always so busy in there.  The one draft I wish they had is kiltlifter--- since it is a local favorite, they may see more people ordering it if it were on draft instead of in the bottle.",

I'm about half way through the menu as it's rather extensive. I highly recommend the \"Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty.\" Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes. With a side of sour cream & salsa..ORGASMIC.  You seriously can't go wrong here people. The Menu versatility is astounding; it's as if they have a pasty specifically tailored to your palate.Try the \"Strawberry Pavlova\"  for dessert. Perfect place for a date or to suck down some good food and beer with your buddies. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.   - Cheers",

I prefer this location to the Tempe one. It's much larger and the service is a lot friendlier. Plus the patio is amazing. Also, the Tempe one has been \"expanding\" forever and it feels as tho it will never be done.",

She got some Thanksgiving Turkey pasty with stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce on the side.  She said it was wonderful.  As a vegetarian there was a whole page of choices!!  I went with the Mock Rosemary Chicken one the waitress recommended.  I really liked it... mock chicken, brie cheese, mushrooms, potatoes, roasted red peppers and a sweet mustard sauce on the side.  It was so filling that I couldn't even finish it.  Which is a bit of a bummer because I wanted one of the delish sounding desserts so bad.  I must make a special trip some night soon just for dessert.  The atmosphere was trendy, fun and friendly.  The service was GREAT.  The food was cheap and as good as it gets.

We tried one of the rosemary pasties and didn't really enjoy it but last time we had the pilgrim and my wife and I both thought it was great.    The pasties are smallish compared with portions at most restaurants and a little on the expensive side at 8 to 10 dollars each.  The house salad comes with a great and unique dressing that is almost like a pesto.  The oven chips are some of the best French fries I've had.  The roasted potatoes were on the dry side.  The mushy peas are good but I'm not sure what to compare them with.  The place is small and a little awkward with much of the seating being long benches.  The staff is good but a little on the brusque side.  Last time we were in the waiter told us he had something else take care of and asked if we minded waiting.  He was trying to get another table out that needed to get back to work.  Once we had his attention he was very attentive that left me feeling like we were bothering him at the same time.    Neither my wife nor I really care for the red wine gravy.  It tastes a little muddy to us.  The potato leek soup is excellent with a strong flavor of stilton cheese and a nice slice of bread.  They also have a great beer selection.  I'm sure we will go back again but Cornish Pasty is not on our regular rotation.",

We had to take one table and hover around waiting for another. Then we waited so long for service one family had to leave. 90 minutes after I arrived someone finally took my dinner order.  I've been here before and pastys just aren't my thing. Haven't found one I liked so I tried their chicken caesar salad instead. It was a large serving but mediocre.

I have almost tried everything on the menu here, and though I have my favorites, I have never disliked one pasty, salad, soup or dessert I have tried.  The food can take a long to come out if you go when it's busy, but with the large beers they offer the wait doesn't seem so bad.  My go to pasty is the Cajun, it got a bit of spice but it's amazing.  For the non-meat eaters they make two different types of vegan pastys daily but they can run out in the evenings so it's a good idea to call ahead if that's what you are looking to have.  They also have a lot of vegetarian options, all of which are delicious!  And if you are a sweets person the banoffee is a very sweet, graham cracker crusted, caramel filled dessert topped with whip cream and bananas (or strawberries if you request them).  Like it said its VERY sweet and big enough to share, but it's worth the calories.  The atmosphere and seating at the Mesa location are great, especially with the new expansion.  They have the place mostly lit by dim lights and candles which makes it a fun place to have date nights or even just go for drinks.  This place is awesome!",

I really enjoyed my pasty but I know my parents weren't as impressed. I had the veggie rosemary chicken, yes Quorn veggie chicken is the best thing ever. The pasty had veggie chicken, roasted red peppers, roasted red potatoes and some brie; it was fantastic. We also had some pea soup, baked broccoli & cauliflower, and some oven chips. The broccoli was delicious (I have an aversion to cauliflower) and the chips were good too; remember chips=fries, crisps=potato chips. Both my parents were disappointed with their dips, the chicken pot pie came with some red wine gravy instead of chicken gravy and the chicken alfredo came with ice cold marinara, they were out of alfredo sauce. Bottled beer was a little pricey. I still love me some Cornish Pasty.",

The place is lit by candles and soft lightings, with metal music playing in the background. Occasional rock and metal music plays in the back ground which goes well with the easy ambience. The place despite its unconventional getup offers intimacy for groups and also welcomes loners. They have a huge collection of beer, both domestic and imported, all reasonably priced. On to the main course - pasties. Comparing pasty with hot-pockets oversimplifies this delicacy. Alright, its roasted bread stuffed with cheese and your choice of meat, but there is so much more to it. Depending on what you get, you'll get to enjoy vibrant flavors that go well with your choice of alcohol (personal recommendation - get Buddingtons). Pasty recommendation: Peppered Lamb",

I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.

I have been to England multiple times and have never enjoyed the food, so I was pleasantly surprised when I actually liked this British cuisine here in the states. I also ordered the peanut butter and jelly pasty for desert and it was \"ok\". I thought it was going to be amazing but I was a bit disappointed. Ok now for the interesting part. I'll set the mood. Sunday 8:30pm and starving. We sit ourselves at the bar. There were very few customers in the restaurant so we thought we would enjoy the ambiance at the bar.....WRONG! Our server was very nice and brought me my favorite import! But all the rest of the cooks/servers/staff were just ridiculous. They were having a fun time at work at the expense of the customer. I was trying to have a conversation with my bf and I literally could not hear him because the guys in the kitchen were SO LOUD. They were singing (off key) yelling at each other, horsing around open flames, and just being immature obnoxious boys. I'm not sure how old any of them are but my guess would have been 12. Our quiet evening out was pretty much ruined. I could tell that some of the other servers we uncomfortable with the obnoxious behavior but were unwilling to speak up. I'm not sure if there was a manager on duty, but I guarantee the behavior I witnessed would have not been tolerated. My suggestion to management.... have a manager on staff at all times, or else you will lose customers. The staff you hired is clearly not able to work without supervision. If anyone would like very specific details please email me.",

    "text": "After one visit, I think I'm sold. The moment you walk in the door, you're instantly welcomed into a very warm and inviting atmosphere. From the dark interior, to the long wooden benches and sectioned off seating, to the outdoor seating and full bar and delicious, unique, hearty food, the Cornish Pasty Company is beckoning me back for a drink with friends. They've got a good selection of draft beers, and an even larger selection of pasties from traditional options, to even vegetarian pasties. The staff were friendly and we got our food and drinks promptly so no problems on that front.   I ordered the Oggie and my girlfriend got the Cottage Pie. Both came out fresh and hot with their red wine sauce on the side. The Oggie has highlights of sliced potatoes and chunks of tender steak. The Cottage Pie, the alternative to the Shepherd's Pie, had a good serving of mashed potatoes, peas, and well seasoned ground beef. While the red wine sauce was very good, the flavor palette fit the Oggie better as the steak had a nice roasted flavor, whereas the Cottage Pie was able to stand alone by itself.  I would definitely recommend giving them a try with some friends. If you're anything like me, your food adventures have probably not lead you to home-cooked British food. As such, this was a breath of fresh air from the hoards of mediocre ethnic foods I've had to sift through to find the gems. That being said, their pasties are perfect for hearty drinking food, and they've certainly got a good enough selection to cover the latter. If I were to provide critique, I'd have liked some board games or possibly even Jenga to make the atmosphere even more conducive for a chill drinking night with friends. Hopefully, this wouldn't ruin the comfy and warm mood the Cornish Pasty Company has going for itself, as blaring TVs and obnoxious loud music certainly would. Although they only get a 4/5 for now, the loss of 1 star is merely because I'm a reserved critic. I definitely see myself coming back, and if my experience is as good as this time, they will easily earn that 5/5 no problem.   Short Version: Warm, comfy, good beer selection, hearty food, vegetarian options, fair prices, a must eat!",

She said it wasn't too authentic (since pastys are usually just 1 flavor of meat or something haha) but the concept and selection was even better than what she had had in England!  It's basically a giant hand-held [chicken[ pot pie/calzone with yummier crust.  It took a really long time to get the food out - but waiter was really friendly and their English cider was yum and strong!    They have Wi-Fi but I never could get the correct password...  Also there's only one toilet per restroom which seems weird to me since there's a huge bar inside the restaurant...where do all the drunk bladders go!?  Would definitely go again if I'm ever randomly in Mesa :)",

It was a bit too spicy and I could have used some more of the sauce. I also had a nice hazelnut brown ale with it. The service left something to be desired. We did get refills of water and tea, but we had a hard time getting our server's attention when we needed something. There were long gaps between seating us, taking our order, refilling our drinks, taking our beer order, bringing us our beer, and getting our check. I tried to get help several times as we were eating, but couldn't seem to get anyone over to our table. There was also music playing pretty loudly, making it hard to have a conversation. I'd definitely order food to go, but not sure I'd dine in again.",

Overall, this place has great food and service and l plan to be back.   -------------------- I hate to give this place 2 stars but... My last experience deserves zero stars; overall I've had a good experience here (previously).    Let me preface by saying normally I get excellent service here. ---- We arrived and waited over 10 mins to be acknowledged.   Our server was a short haired blonde (our ticket says Kitten?).   She advised she was very busy.  After 15 mins of being seated we finally received water.  She took and served our drink order before telling us nearly 2/3 of the menu wasn't avail because of St Paddies day.  At this point I have a 20oz beer in front of me so obviously we aren't going to leave.  She should've led with that.   -- The food was good but couldn't order our favorites because of the pasty shortage.  Do not get me wrong; this poor rating is based on solely the service, not the food shortage.  My wife and I both ran out of waters and waited 15 mins before getting a refill from a bar back.  I ran out of beer and had to wait 10 mins before flagging down someone to order another.  With such a huge markup on alcohol, I've never had the experience of having to ask for another beer at a restaurant.    -- Anyway, observed another table very annoyed by being abandoned by same server, overall very poor service.  Saw a lot of goofing off from my server after she says she's slammed.  Will I be back?   Sure, because of prior positive  experiences.   However, if she walks up to our table, I will leave promptly.",

Never having a pasty before, I went with the safe choice and selected the cottage pie (shepard's pie with ground beef instead of minced lamb). They bake to order, so the freshness is off the scale here. In fact, sip on your drinks a bit longer as the food is piping hot when it arrives. Our server was extremely nice and helpful with the menu items.   I thought the pastry was excellent- flaky, fresh, baked just right. The interior was bland. I had to add several shakes of salt and pepper to get a little more flavor from it. Also, the red wine gravy that came on the side was not for me. It just had a peculiar taste, although the server said it was very popular. The prices were good, around $10 for any pasty and a couple bucks for a soda.  I'd like to visit CPC again during the evening and take advantage of the large outdoor patio. I'd bet the right pasty pairs really well with a cold pint of IPA or Guinness. I would try something a little more adverturous next time around, but definitely want to come back.",

So I turned to the fine Yelpers I have come to know and love and found Cornish Pasty with the highest reviews in Mesa. Off I went having no clue what I was in for and never having had \"British\" food.   I have now found my new favorite obsession!!! We ordered two Pasty to share... the italian and the spicy chicken asagio. Both were my favorite! They were stuffed with lots of ingredients and came with sauces and were very tasty. We also got the oven chips with garlic and jalapeno. I think these are the best \"chips\" I have had anywhere hands down. We wanted more but were stuffed! However, not too stuffed to go for dessert. We shared the banana/carmel/graham cracker crust/whip cream pie. And wanted to lick the plate clean and fought like 2 year olds over the last bite! While it was large enough for two people and probably three people, it was so good that I think next time we will start with dessert!  Love the atmosphere here as well. Really unique and we don't have much around Mesa that really transports you to another place. I can't wait to go back and have found my new obsession!",

    "text": "As Brits who came to Chandler Arizona 7 years ago, we are always on the lookout for some nostalgia and comfort food from our birth country. When we stubbled on Cornish Pasty we were candidly skeptical, about the pasty and if they captured the True originality of this historic food. We found this small and fun eclectic restaurant staffed by interesting and pleasant staff. The pasties were amazing and they captured the very essence of why a Cornish Pasty is such a great meal on its own. That was a few years ago and we would have given it a well deserved 5 stars.   However, since then with their success and growth into a restaurant 3 times the size, its become worse and the service is now dreadful. On the last 3 occasions we've been, its gotten progressively worse and the once attentive service has become the victim of added size and popularity.    As an example, on the last visit we never even got noticed by the staff who basically worked around us, until I asked for a server. When she arrived, her attitude was as though her job would be awesome if not for customers demanding service and food. I asked for a Boddingtons Beer, which frankly is one of the reasons we go as its a favorite British beer for many folks. they had none left and it was 5:15pm. One star taken away.   When we ordered our food, both our choices were \" sold out\" as they are, \"very popular\" , what at 5:15pm. Seriously. Are they holding back perhaps, to serve the to-go clientele ? So our second choice was ordered. That too was not available. Another star dropped.   So third choice came and it was good, but we still remained disappointed. It remains to be seen if this popular pasty place, will keep its loyal customers, because with growth and success possible apathy and over confidence can creep into a restaurant. Sadly for us, that is what we felt on our last visit. Hence, only 3 stars. Pity because this gem of restaurant is losing its charm, as they grow their business. I only hope the owners take note.",

Well this time,  it was different, it was like I opened the menu with my eyes closed and dropped my finger to the item at random...The Royale with Cheese!  From top to bottom I loved it all.  The medium cooked hamburger, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, a cheddar swiss blend and French fries all wrapped up in a golden pastry with 1000 island for dipping.  I even requested a second side of 1000 island because it was a match made in heaven.  I don't throw that phrase around that easily so when I say it.....believe me, I mean it.    The atmosphere always puts me in a mood...you know that mood you get into when you don't care about anything...especially time.  And that's a good thing because you are in for typically a 20 minute wait while your pasty.  That's why I always order  their large Hoegaarden...it definitely adds to that mood.    I can't decide which locations I like...but so far...if I am in an outdoors mood I go to the Tempe location and if I am in the mood for indoors I go to Mesa.  Both have great music playing in the background...sometimes Zeppelin, or Iron Maiden, or Judas Priest...that sort of music.  Their seating consists of either large picnic type tables, great for large groups or belly up to the bar to eat and drink and be entertained.  If you like to people watch..I recommend eating at the bar where you can watch the magic.   Overall the experience is nothing short of fantastic every single time so please...never change.  But who am I to tell you what to do and what not to do.  I look forward to my next trip and the new Spicy Barbecue Chicken Pasty.  It sounds amazing.",

We got the 32oz and it was huge! Perfect for 2 people who don't drink beer that often :). We ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty and the Bangers and Mash Pasty. The crust was to die for! It was simply perfect. I asked the waitress how you would traditionally eat these and it was really nice of her to give us a little history! I enjoyed the history and origin of pasties. For dessert we ordered the Apple Caramel Pasty. Normally we never order dessert because we are too full or when we do we never finish it because it gets too sweet but man I loved this dessert, it was just the right amount of sweetness and the best part is that we were able to get more of that delicious crust. We did go for my best friends birthday and unfortunately they don't do anything for birthdays. Overall however we had an amazing time, it was really relaxing especially after our flight. I would really recommend this place and I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I have visited Cornish Pasty too many times to count: some visits before the expansion as well as after the expansion.  Each visit is consistently delicious as my first visit.  Cornish Pasty is definitely a favorite place for me, and I even have family and friends who are vegetarians and vegans who love it just as much!  The Place actually has more than just a couple selections for vegetarian options; they also have at least four different vegan pasty options.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  I can't exactly pinpoint an item for you to try, since I have loved everything I've tried... I will tell you, though, that I have tasted AT LEAST one item in each section: pasties, sides, soups, and salads, minus the dessert section, and everything is ALWAYS satisfactory!  If you need an recommendation for soup, the \"Mushroom, Walnut, and Spinach Soup\" will leave you feeling warm and good all inside.  I always end up feeling fully satisfied from one half of my pasty along with one side that is shared between me and my boyfriend, so I never have enough room for dessert.  It has been so hard to go in there and order only dessert, especially when their pasties calls my name!  However, I do keep hearing that all of their desserts are very good--I WILL try them some day!  Along with the food, I am impressed with the staff/service - my boyfriend and I always get exceptional service. Our waiters always go out of their way to make us feel like we matter!  I also dig the ambiance/seating arrangement.  Some of their seating is interesting, as they are equipped with church pews--it's a pretty cool touch.  With its pews and European atmosphere, I feel like I'm not in AZ anymore.  Now, if you find yourself going to Cornish Pasty more frequently, try to sit at the counter near the open kitchen at least once - it's fascinating to watch the cooks make the food; a lot of love goes into the food and I think it shows in its delectable taste!  Just try it already! I hope you enjoy your experience here as I always do!",

I finally decided on the peppered steak. The server asked me if i was OK with Stilton cheese (similar to blue), and I assured her that was fine. The pasty was very tasty, with numerous slices of tender steak, caramelized onions, portobello mushrooms and zucchini. The aforementioned cheese was just the right amount. I also looked the side of brandy  peppercorn cream sauce.   The service was a bit slow, but other than that, it was a great find. I'll definitely add this to my list of places to eat when I'm ever back in the valley of the sun.",

If you are on a diet, don't come here! The food is hearty and filling.   There are vegetarian options and the online menu says there are two vegan options, but I am not sure about that as they use a TON of butter, but I don't see them lying about it as they are a great place.",

There's a regular bar, another bar that overlooks the kitchen, lots of cozy tables and some long tables perfect for larger groups.   Food is always excellent. They have a wide variety of pasties, from more traditional flavors like Cottage Pie to some pretty unique choices like Tikka Masala. I'm vegetarian and they have LOTS of options for me (vegan options are available as well!). The menu is also set up so it's really easy for people with dietary restrictions to understand what they're ordering, with little symbols under many of the items. My fiance always orders a pasty, but sometimes I end up just getting a bowl of soup as my meal because their soup is that amazing.  The drink selection is really good as well. Lots of beers on tap and then a good amount of bottles and cans if you aren't feeling any of those options.",

Somehow I was persuaded into getting some garlic roasted fries, and I have to say, those fries were delsih! Glad the boys were there to share though, they made a perfect side to any pasty!  I was thrilled to see they had Banoffee Pie, so I knew I had to order it! It had a crisp graham cracker crust, nice creamy caramel, whipped cream topped with fresh banana slices, this right here is comfort dessert! Keep it simple and sweet! LOVED IT, want more!",

Love the fact that you can belly up to the kitchen bar and converse with the cooks. Love the Portland hipster feel. My daughter and I split a Chicken Tikka Marsala pasty and it was delicious. I didn't care for the yogurt sauce as it was strangely sweet. I'm not a fan of tahini sauce, the alternative, in general. That's ok though because the pasty can stand just nicely on its own. And lastly, love the beer selection!! I did wish there'd been some tvs to watch college football but I have to appreciate a space where people can come to have conversations and great food and not be distracted. I am looking forward to trying more!",

THE BAD: - Everything was a bit over salted. - No actual fried chips (french fries).  The baked chips weren't bad for being baked but don't compare to real chips, and detract from the whole idea of a Cornish place. - Almost $10 for a pasty seems a bit steep.  THE UGLY: - No malt vinegar, only balsamic. Epic fail!  Brits would be appalled. - Out of the first two beers we asked for due to claimed problems with the kegs.  Weak sauce.",

Also, if you offer real tea, you need serve the right way, with milk, and options of honey or cream.  With all of the constructive comments said, the Pasty was great, the atmosphere was great.",

We sat at the bar this afternoon and were really the only ones there but our bartender totally rocked, he gave us tons of recommendations for drinks, pasties and desert. You could see he was clearly busy making drinks for the whole bar but he paid tons of attention to us and made sure everything was taken care of. I wish I remembered his name but none the less, awesome. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo Pasty...nothing what I expected but it was definitely more than what I expected, it was so delicious! We also got an order of the garlic chips....wow is all I can say about those. We obviously had to try the deserts our bartender recommended the bread and butter pudding....holy crap....die and go to heaven good.   We will clearly be back again, and hopefully have the same bartender we had this afternoon. The atmosphere is great, the food is amazing, and the service was awesome! I will be telling friends about this place for a while.   Chive On!",

I am at an utter loss as to why this place seems to have an almost cult-like following. I did like my beer, and I see beer routinely mentioned in these favorable reviews (insert glowing \"I love you, man\" restaurant review here). Really thinking I ought to give this place a second try if for no other reason than I trust my friends' opinions and might have just had a random bad experience.",

They're so big, my friend and I (both of us girls) split one, so it was only $4.50 each. I also got the mushroom spinach soup, which comes with homemade (I think) bread and butter, and the soup was warm, thick, and not too creamy. We finished off with the Shirley Temple for dessert, an amazing toffee, chocolatey bread pudding that comes with a white cream you can stir into it. Restaurant is pretty dark inside, and they play loud Indie music, so I wouldn't go with a client or boss, but with friends, it's great. Just the right volume so you can notice the music, but still have a conversation.",

    "text": "I'm sure there are those who would not enjoy the food, service, or atmosphere at the Cornish Pasty Company. They would be wrong. Don't hang around those kind of people. Life is too short. We started with the chicken liver pate and Scotch egg. Both quite excellent. I really liked the honey mustard that came with the egg but my wife requested something else and tried the tsiki sauce. Killer. Btw, these folks aren't pouring stuff out of a bottle or bucket or microwaving your dinner. This is real food prepared by real chefs who know what their doing and it shows. I hadn't had a pate in a long time so it kind of got to be 'new' again for me. First bite. Interesting. And every mouthful became more interesting and delightful. I refrained from liking the bowl because of some sense of shame if seen.We split an 'Oggie' for our pasty experience. This is I think their most popular pasty and it was very good dipped in the house-made red wine gravy. Steak, rutabaga, potatoes, and onion. There's probably fifteen or so other pasties to choose from. Note there is a difference between a pasty (short a) and pasty (long a). In some places, pasties (long a) are required. We ordered dessert based on hearing a 'wow' from a nearby table and looking just in time to see a spoon moving from mouth back to dessert. Choc cake, topping and ice cream. Yes.  Top staff. Jenny, our waitress, if she's in, ask for her. Blouse and jewelry to match her tats. And any young woman with a 'Dad' tat hits this Grandpa's sweet spot. Randy, the manager, cruises the place and seems to genunely care about your dining experience. The staff seems to like working t  One last word that maybe best describes this place. I ordered a Speckled Hen Ale. Unusual to even see on the menu. English ale. I had to try it. #1 - it was an ale of a quality I would love to drink it on a regular basis. #2 - it was served at the proper temperature so that one could fully enjoy its quality. Not that American fetish ice-cold thing that allows a nation to drink swill and not know it. Yep. Beer snob here. Sue me. But not too bad. I drink Grain Belt whenever I have a chance.",

    "text": "I have to say that I really felt like I was taking a risk going there for lunch.  First off, I heard a lot of negative things: long lunch, slow service, dirty place, smells when you walk in, dingy servers and food preppers.. though I don't recall any \"food sucks\" comments, which is exactly why I took the \"risk\" of having lunch there.  My comments on the so-called negative things others pointed out: -long lunch/slow service: Yes, this was not a short lunch .. but it was also not a long lunch.  Food took a bit long but we also were expecting 'custom-baked' pasty.  Plus our server was quick enough to bring us drinks and my soup order, etc to hold us over;  Our server guy was outstanding - friendly in a genuine way, prompt, kept checking on us, and had very good customer service skills (I'll get to that later). -dirty place: Yes, as I mentioned, it needs a good cleaning (those pew cushions were nasty and the wax should be scraped off and menus cleaned up) -smells: Yes, but we deduced it was the cabbage. -dingy servers/food preppers: It's an 'alternative' type of staff.. I myself am not that alternative, but I have no issues if my servers look like Cheba Hut or Pita Jungle employees :) As long as they are clean with handling my food (at least, that I notice).  I did note, however one of the food preppers talking on his cell phone while he was handling food.. I thought that was gross (god knows where cell phones hang out and all the dingy dialing we do).  OK, so now to the food: I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend had the Chicken Pot Pie - both were delicious!  I was super impressed with the breadth of the pasty 'stuffings' and got very excited to see they had over 40 options!  I want to go back and try them all.  The yogurt served with my tikka was perfect.. the chicken was plentiful and well seasoned.  Essentially, their fillings are both inventive, somewhat unique and really entice me to come back.  Plus, I appreciated that their pastys are a good size and that it is not a dough-overwhelmed dish (meaning the crust is perfectly thinly sized and not like a calzone).  Bottome line: Yes, there is a distinctly strong smell when you walk in ...yes, the pews had dirty cushions on them.. the candle wax was all over the table/menus, the menus had other grime on there.. honestly this place REALLY needs to quit the slacking and clean this place up... BUT, their pastys were yummy and their service was excellent - 2 major players in making me want to come back.  Okay, so now to the note about customer service: I found a piece of red thick rubber-band (~1\" long) in my soup .. we could only assume, due to it's color and size, it was the ones used to bunch up produce (It was a leek-potato, stilton soup).  Yeah, not excited about that find, but I did appreciate that when I mentioned it to our server, he swiftly took it away (offered me a new one) and immediately apologized and said it was 'on the house'.  THAT is fixing a problem immediately and correctly - kudos for him for a great response and showing good customer service.  I can understand that 'shit happens' sometimes but it's the aftermath of how you treat the customer that found the rubber band in their soup that matters.  I'll be back!",

On my most recent trip I had the Cajun chicken pasty again but with oven chips.  The oven chips were fabulous with garlic.  The pasty was exploding with flavor.  The crust was flaky and delicious.  The filling was very delicious.  I wish we had something similar back in St. Louis as it would be a great hit.    Since my last review they have doubled in size.  The new space looks great!

I went to the Cornish Pasty for lunch.  I drove from the Northern part of Mesa, so it was a good 25 minute drive each way for lunch.  I was hoping for the best to drive that far and take a longer lunch.  The menu was very diverse and suited many types of cravings.  They had everything in the pasty from chicken pot pie to chicken tikka massala.  I would like to try one of those one day, but I opted for the portobello vinagrette.  It came with a piping hot side of marinara sauce that had some fresh garlic cut into the sauce.  When I took that first bite, I felt like I was in heaven.  The serving size is very good and I got pretty full from one pasty.  If I had room for more, they had dessert pasties as well, such as a caramel apple.  Well worth the drive, and I will definitely make a visit to the Tempe location closer to home.",

I am looking forward to working my way through the menu at this place.  I met fellow Yelper Donald S here for lunch and we sat at the bar where we could watch the kitchen.  As I watched the busy bees busily going about making pasties and other delicious looking things I noticed the ingredients sitting around on shelves...nothing prefab.  No bags from Sysco or some other purveyor of pre-made restaurant ingredients.  Nope, just fresh veggies, fresh meats, lots of big cans and bottles of spices and seasonings.    I am getting hungry right now thinking about the food.  Yum.  Update (I've been there again since I started my review):  Now that I have gone a second time and tried a salmon pasty, the royale pasty (sort of like a bacon cheeseburger) and shared a dessert I can unequivocally state that Cornish Pasty is one of my top ten favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Service has been great and my last visit I sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and chatted with the folks as they were cooking.  Nice people here!",

That about sums up all you need to know about cornish but if you need to know more just think of the best hot pocket you ever had, multiple the quality by a million and you have a pasty. I have tried numerous items from here ranging from the homemade sausage salad (too big for a single sitting so leftovers=winning) to the lovely bit 'o salmon to the strawberry pavlova dessert and it is all great.   My biggest problem coming to this place is the near pannick attack get from having to choose from too many great options. I'd tell you what my favorite pasty was but that would imply that one is better than the others which simply isn't True. Plus they have something for pretty much everybody, the only thing is if you are super picky pastys are cooked to order but not made to order so ingredients can't be swapped. Even then anybody I have ever come with has been able to find something.",

    "text": "They have a great selection of beers, especially microbrews and specialty beers.  The selection of pasties is even more impressive.  If you don't know what a pasty is, it is very similar to a calzone, or huge empanadas that is baked.  They filling run the gamut from traditional pasty fillings like \"bangers and mash\", chicken vindaloo, Mediterranean and latino inspired dishes.  They even offer vegetarian versions of most of their meat-based pasties.  We started with cream of leek, potato and Stilton cheese soup, which was creamy and tastey, with just a hint of bitterness from the Stilton cheese.  I had more traditional shepherd's pie with minted lamb, potatoes, carrots and peas.  It came with a gravy that went well with the pasty.  The crust was flaky with a lovely toasting.  My husband ordered the Carne Avodada which was flavorful and spicy and came with sour cream and pico de gallo.    The ambience is what you would expect in an British pub.  There is a mixture of small tables and long trestle tables with very few booths.  They have candles in wine bottles at the trestle tables, which makes reading the menu a bit difficult for us older folks.  They do have seating outside with misters for hot weather.  The waitress we had was knowledgeable about both the beers and the menu, helping me choose a dark ale and letting me know that the chicken vindaloo was the spiciest dish on their menu.  We have gone here once before with friends and would love to bring our kids here sometime in the future.  As an added bonus for me, there were no TVs that I could see, which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in restaurants.  The only criticism I have is that the music was too loud for my preference, though I did enjoy the selection of music.",

The concept is good, I was excited... but it was such a let down. I wish I remembered the names of the items I ordered, but the left little to remember. I ordered take out, but live across the street so I doubt that had much to do with my experience. Food was bland, and when it did have flavor it felt like someone just stuffed a pastry with leftovers and some seasoning and puts price on it. Nothing I ordered I enjoyed, waste of money.",

    "text": "I love this place so much!  I go here at least once a month.  This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in town.  The atmosphere is awesome.  It is hard to describe, almost like industrial meets traditional.  They have drip candles in wine bottles on all the tables.  They have a bar area that serves drinks and then a \"bar\" area where you can sit facing the kitchen and watch the cooks prepare food.  My daughter and I usually sit there.  They have a big patio as well.  The service is always great.  The food of course is the star of the show.   Even the beverages are great.  The tea is very fresh and I usually get the hibiscus tea.  So good!  If you have never tried a pasty, this is the place to try one.  The Oggie is one of my favorites but there are so many options and delicious ones.  It is awesome that they have many vegetarian options and even some vegan options too, as I have some friends who do not eat meat or dairy.  Everything I have tried has been amazing, literally a party in your mouth ;)   I love thier tomato soup it is so creamy and flavorful and comes with the most delicious thick slices of homemade bread.  I love their pasta salad which I order frequently.  It is bowtie pasta tossed in a pesto sauce with artichokes, spinach, roasted red peppers, feta, onions, etc  It is so yummy!  Desserts are fantastic too.  I usually get the banoffee pie which is a graham cracker crust with homemade caramel on top, then topped with fresh whipped cream and sliced bananas.  Simple ingredients but so amaaaaaazing!  Everything is made from scratch and you can tell.  Everything is fantastic here, you will not be disappointed.  I will be back again and again. :)",

I have eaten Cornish pasties in England many times and these are as good as any I ate there.  I see everyone raves about the red wine sauce but I don't care for it.  It is not needed and only detracts from the flavor of the pasty.  I was impressed that they had HP sauce, which I love, but it too does not work with pasties.",

The brocolli cauliflower bake was awful (water at bottom of bowl, and layer of rubbery cheese melted on top). Maybe get some tips on food and service from the Scottsdale location.

I don't need a boyfriend any longer . . . I can get a Shepherds pie to keep me safe and warm. Need someone to make you feel loved and wanted?

Try the Tikka Masala and then change your last name to Cornish Pasty-Tikka Masala.. no one will question you ...because they know you found what is right in the world.  Feeling a little tied down? Try Reuben.. he's so good and filled with pastrami and can take you to the 1000 Islands. . . he's like an ugly fat man but rich so he's a bit more attractive. But, certainly delicious.  Want to get a little freaky? BANGERS and MASH! It's like a threesome in you mouffff! Do it!!  Go to Cornish Pasty! Seriously!!!

The bartender was friendly enough and well informed about all the beer selections. We also eyed the pool table and decided we will come back one night just to play a few games. About 15 minutes later our friends arrived and we had a seat. Everything was went smooth until our server decided to start talking politics. Ugh. He mentioned how Trump's favorite drink was the Moscow Mule and went on a semi-rant about how awful Republicans voters are. This indeed offended at least 2 people in my group who are indeed Republicans. It was a bit of a bummer that our night had to become awkward and ruined because this waiter assumes everyone thinks just like him. If we do return to Cornish Pasty again, it will be to another location so we don't encounter this guy. Too bad because the beers were large and cold and the food delicious.",

The tenders always have a suggestion for us, and have no problem letting us taste a sample before ordering a tap beer. He got the Royale which is MY favorite, while I tried the Bit of Salmon. So freaking good! Tons of flavor in both, but I think the Salmon is my new fave. To drink he had the Union Jack IPA in a 32 (I think) ounce, and I had my favorite Not Your Dads Root Beer. We had a great time, and were very satisfied. No it wasn't fancy wining and dining, but it tickled our fancy and we spent our 16th anniversary relaxing and enjoying ourselves. Best of all for my husband was the music. A great assortment of metal for my headbanger, lol. We'll most certainly be back.",

We sat in front of the kitchen and had loads of fun watching the guys (and one gal) make the pasties with great dexterity.  My friend and I started the meal with garlic chips that were addicting and so flavorful.  They're not skinny and oily like regular garlic fries.  These chips are large warm wedges infused with garlic flavor.  I highly suggest getting them!    My friend got the chicken pot pie pasty and really liked it.  I had a bite and found myself in strong agreement.  My lamb and mint pasty was also good, as it was very balanced, but I was a bit disappointed by how dry the lamb was.  The gravy it came with fixed that though.  Finally, we ended the meal with sticky toffee pudding.  It was actually my third choice in desserts because the first two choices had sold out.  But regardless, this dessert was so so soooo very delicious!  It was crunchy on the outside, but soft and gooey on the inside.  The sweetness level was perfect, and the cream sauce brought the dessert to the perfect level of indulgence.  I am definitely going back here.  There are so many pasties that I want to try, and all under $10!",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty is great for lunch with friends.  They have a couple of locations locally here in the Phoenix area and are quickly expanding elsewhere too. (I've heard they are opening a location in Las Vegas).  For those who don't know what Pastys are, they are pastries filled with meats and other ingredients and baked.  Sort of like a calzone, but not pizza related.  I usually end up getting the Italian pasty - it's filled with pepperoni, salami, capocollo, ham, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and roasted tomatoes and served with a side of marinara.  They have plenty of other options too like The Porky, Shepperd's Pie, Cajun Chicken, Lovely Bit of Salmon, and The Pilgrim to name a few.  Making changes or substitutions to the pastys won't really pay off for you because the pastys are pre-made that day and, if you need anything removed or added to yours, they will need to make a brand new one and it takes a lot longer to get it baked and out to you.  They will gladly make the substitutions, just be ready to wait for it.  Traditionally, the Cornish Pasty locations have had super small dining rooms, but this location just expanded into the space next door and it's really opened up a lot of additional seating.  We have stopped going to Cornish Pasty with our son because of the amount of time it takes to get the food delivered to the table.  This is not the fault of the restaurant, (the service is usually really good) the pastys just have to bake for awhile and our 18 month old son gets antsy and is done with sitting in the highchair before the food arrives.  It hasn't stopped us from going to Cornish Pasty, we just don't go with him anymore.",

If I had to give my favorites they would be: Veggie Spicy Asiago, Veggie Rosemary & Veggie Pesto. All equally delicious!   The restaurant itself definitely has a hipster vibe- dark, wine bottles with candle wax dripping down the side, old church pews as table benches. They also have a large outdoor patio.   Don't have time for a sit down meal? Call in your order to go. They will either cook them hot and ready to eat or half bake them and you can pop them in your oven at home to eat when you are ready.

    "text": "I recently moved back to Arizona from the bay area and have become somewhat of a food snob.  Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, Piedmont... they all had so many amazing restaurants to offer.  Cornish Pasties could be uprooted and planted smack dab in any one of the aforementioned cities (or any other in Northern California for that matter) and they would blow the competition away.  Since moving home, I've eaten and/or had drinks here about a half a dozen times.  That's about once a week.  They have salads, pasties, and desserts that are to die for!  I love the vegetarian cottage pie with whatever that amazeballs sauce on the side is as well as the banana/whip cream dessert (the name is slipping my mind at the moment).  The first time I visited Pasties, my friend and I split the pasta salad.  It was big enough to share and so delicious!    Do not visit Cornish Pasties if you are in a rush.  Remember the phrase, \"good things come to those that wait?\"  You will need to keep it in mind here.  They are baking thick ass pastries for cheese and rice's sake.  Calm down and wait for one of the best culinary moments of your life.  DO come here if you'd like to receive attentive and fun service!  Every time we've come in, we've received some of the most laid back yet knowledgeable service the valley has to offer.  Bottom Line... a must try!  Thanks for being so awesome!",

My favorites are the carne adovado (extra sour cream) has a great spice, taste of Mexico! The pilgrim is great, tastes like thanksgiving, I probably order this the most (extra cranberry sauce), the chicken tiki masala is your taste of India and delicious. Love the royal w cheese when I'm wanting a cheeseburger. What we do most if the time is order it half baked and cook the rest at home, with 4 kids it's not very kid friendly (although they are nice to the kids). The expansion looks great and it's a cool place to hang at. For dessert get the banoffee!! Best hands down",

Daughter 1 is a vegetarian and for the veggie cottage pasty-she thought it was a little dry.  Daughter 2 had the Royale with cheese.  She seemed to enjoy it.  I opted for the chicken pot pie and it was heaven! We topped everything off with the chocolate bread and butter pudding and the bannafee.  The chocolate dessert was...odd.  not my favorite.  The bannafee was to die for.  Seriously.  I'd die for it!! Overall great food, good service.",

    "text": "Prologue: My fiancee and I were discussing where to go for our weekly Saturday evening dinner date and she said she was in the mood for some protein.  I looked through some places in our area, which I had recently bookmarked based on reviews from my fellow Elites. I recommended this restaurant and it turned out to be just what she had in mind.  The Plot: We started by sharing the Blinkin Heng salad, which was followed by a Shepherd's Pie Signature Pasty and a Lovely Bit a Salmon Premium Pasty, and finished with a Sticky Toffee Pudding.  This was the first time for both of us to try this type of cuisine and it was a welcome learning experience.  The Scene: The Blinkin Heng included a pleasing assortment of roasted turkey, greens, fruit, nuts, cheese, bacon (which we requested to have on the side), and hard boiled egg with just the right amount of white balsamic dressing. They kindly split the order into two portions, which was plenty for each of us, and we also appreciated the care that went into to the presentation.  Judging by how flaky and perfect the pasty crusts were, my impression is that they were freshly baked just prior to serving. The contents were also nice and warm when they arrived at our table. My conclusion was that one advantage of preparing pies in a manner similar to a turnover, rather than using a pie tin, meant they could be baked more quickly like a calzone.  The Shepherd's Pie pasty was made with ground lamb along with mashed potato and the usual pot pie veggies and was served with a side of red wine gravy. There was just the right amount of mashed potato surrounding the other ingredients, the lamb was seasoned perfectly for me, and the veggies were firm yet tender. This pasty reminded me of Scaciatta, which is an Italian meat pie that is sometimes made with lamb and something I enjoyed many times when growing up in New England. Consequently, this turned out to be a genuine comfort food experience for me.  The Lovely Bit a Salmon pasty was stuffed with plenty of marinated salmon, a white wine and cream dill sauce, sauteed asparagus, garlic roasted tomato, spinach, and red potato. This pasty reminded me of the type of traditional salmon pie you might find in a northern European country such as Lithuania and it was comparable in quality to the Shepherd's Pie pasty in every regard. My fiancee was completely satisfied with this dish, as any fellow salmon lover most certainly would be.  My fiancee and I place a great deal of importance on the experience of finishing a meal with a delicious, satisfying, and memorable dessert. The Sticky Toffee Pudding we ordered definitely fit the bill. There was plenty of of cake to share, it was warm and moist when it arrived on our table, and the texture and consistency was was like a cross between a brownie and molten chocolate cake, which paired very well with the vanilla ice cream, of course.  The Rest of the Story: The decor was exactly what you would expect at a restaurant with the word Cornish in its name. My fiancee especially liked the wine bottle candle holders on each table.  We were seated right away on a Saturday evening and the staff were courteous and friendly.  Epilogue: The overall quality of the food easily deserves 3 stars. At first we were a bit hesitant to award a 4th star due to the tab for dinner being a little pricey. However, considering the fact that everything was very good along with the relative uniqueness of this type of cuisine we decided that it was worth it.  Photo Design: by Billie Z.",

Friday night, we arrive before 7pm with a group of 5, and are given a \"maybe 20 minutes\" wait time.  We check again in 20 minutes, only to be told \"probably 20 minutes\". This was repeated three more times. Finally our bartender suggested we order at the bar. We had dinner ordered in a little less than 2 hours after arriving.  I asked for the manager and explained the situation. He said sorry, but did not seem very concerned. He said that they were having a really good night, one of their best of the year.  I would not recommend going. BTW our bartender (server) was great.",

We ordered two pasties after relaxing with our beers. It was relatively busy per usual on a Friday night, so the food took a little longer but we weren't stressed at all. Another server ran our food over (no issue there!) Unfortunately she only had my pasty and at that point in time let us know that the kitchen made the wrong one and asked if we wanted to try the one they made instead. (Not trying to be a pain and also being hungry we obliged.) Also knowing my girlfriend is some what picky I figured it wouldn't work out. Any-who she didn't like it so we ended up sharing mine, taking her original correct order Togo after having another beer. I like the atmosphere and food but FOH training needs to be stepped up. Communication is important and I'm guessing our order was either rang in incorrectly or the wrong food went out to the wrong table. Never saw a manager, the servers bought one of the pasties(had it comped later by the manager) Just packing service overall.",

I got a soft spot in my heart for this place.  It was this location that was my first Cornish pasty and even with some of the modernized flavors, this place, from the beers to the pasties, reminded me of England.    My go-to's, the Oggie and the  Bangers and Mash.  Tastes like England.  Especially with a beer along with it.  And beans.  Crust, great.  Filling, great. Gravy, great.  Full stomach for a reasonable price.  I've also had the Royale with cheese, the Shepherd's Pie, and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  All are pretty good.  The chicken tikka masala would be exemplary if they improved their masala just a bit.  But I'd still order all of them again.  Like I said I've had their beans, which are fine.  Also had their walnut soup which is great.  Really rich and filling and delicious.  Finally, had their banoffee.  It is huge and it will destroy you in the best way possible.  It is not delicate and not as refined as the banoffee in England, but it's a tasty sugar bomb.",

It's a large portion; if nothing else, I left with a full stomach. On my second dining experience, I wanted a lighter meal. I ordered the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup, with a Greek salad (no feta). The soup was flavorful, creamy, and well made. It came with sturdy bread that was perfect for soaking up the deliciousness. The salad came with a pesto dressing that was also tasty; as expected, the salad ingredients themselves were ordinary. Pieces of both meals I had here were well done, but they were still lacking in flavor and attention. Those with me ordered the vegan Mexican pasty. They both really enjoyed it.   They have a decent drink selection so definitely look that over. I ordered the Union Jack. Refreshingly light with a bit of tang, hint of sweetness, and a hefty ABV.

The \"chips\" were just okay (we had them with garlic and jalapeno, next time we will try just garlic). Our server was friendly and attentive.  Please note that this is the only one of the three locations that is Yelp classified only as \"British\" and not also as \"Pub\". This seemingly minor detail seems to be not so minor after all:      - Both of the English ales on draft were not available (we wanted English beers with our pasties! Had to settle for a German hefe...)     - While the restaurant was pretty busy, the bar was practically empty. I have never seen so many grown adults ordering lemonade in my life (welcome to Mesa!)    - We were really looking forward to playing darts, but unfortunately a family of four (2 adults and 2 small children) was hogging BOTH sets of darts AND the pool table next to the darts  SO, if you are wanting a place to drink lemonade and teach your young children how to hang out in a bar and play billiards & cricket, this location is for you (there were other families lining up for Billiards while we were there). If you are wanting more of a British Pub type scene to go with your British food, I would try one of the other two locations (which we will be doing next time we crave the goodness of a Cornish Pasty).",

If I ever have friends from out of town visit, odds are I am taking them to Cornish Pasty as it's a fun, casual restaurant that isn't too expensive, has a variety of fillings to satisfy anyone's palate, and you can hold a conversation despite it being pretty packed at times.  My number one pasty is the Pilgrim and I am known by my friends to swear by it.  I have never, ever been disappointed by the Pilgrim as it blends sweetness and savoriness wonderfully.  Other ones to fall back on are the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Royale with Cheese.  I also love the chips/french fries as an appetizer.    Sitting at the bar is also fun as you can watch the chefs make the pasties and they are nice people!  Only cons are: small bathrooms, pasties always seem to take longer than I can bear to be ready to eat, and I am in a pit of despair when they sell out of the Pilgrim!",

    "text": "I ordered the porky and I'm not sure what it was but there's something about the flavor inside the pasty that did not sit well on my tongue. The order itself was pretty hefty and despite my first misgivings I was able to give into my hunger and gobble the whole thing up.   The BEST thing about the meal was the desert- strawberry pavlova. The meringue shells were exactly as advertised; crisp, airy, and full of homemade goodness. I hate overtly sweet deserts and this definitely was not that. The fresh whipped cream and fruit were a perfect complement to the meringue shells.   In fact, I would actually think about returning just for the desert.",

Unfortunately I sat right by some people smoking (not the restaurant's fault, but not pleasant either). It took 20 minutes for our order to be taken and another 45 minutes to get our food. When i finally came, it was good and I like their concept, it just took too long. I was told that the pasties are premade so there can't be any substitutions in them, yet it took so long to make them.. curious. Anyway, I would give them a second chance, but as of now, they were not such a good experience.",

The manager's response seems completely reasonable to me and therefore I will not only change my rating but I will also be back.  I believe that the issue is being addressed and otherwise this place is great.  Thanks for responding, and hopefully this edit is a help in doing my part... although I know you guys will do just fine with or without my business as your food is delicious, I still appreciate it.  Thanks *end of edit*  So I would normally give this place 5 stars because I love the food here and the ambiance is very cool... HOWEVER, 2 of the last 3 times I have gone I have seen cockroaches there...  The first time I was sitting at the bar and there was a cockroach on their walk in fridge.  Then a couple months later I was sitting at a table in the stage area they have right when you walk in, and roach came scurrying across the railing next to our table.  I'm sorry, but no matter how good the food is, that's disgusting.  I wrote it off as an anomaly the first time, but twice?  Sorry but I have to let people know...",

    "text": "And now for my 300th review...........  What is a pasty?  It's a lovely piece of pastry filled with yummy stuff.  You can fill a pasty with almost everything.  Shepard's Pie, Cottage Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala, meat and cheese or something akin to a Chicken Pot Pie.  It's all delicious!  Sounds like a Hot Pocket you say?  Oh no, no, no, this is much more and infinetly better than an item you find in the frozen food section of your local grocer.  A pasty is fresh, not frozen, and the filling choices are infinetly better than the stardard ham and cheese or pepperoni pizza hot pocket.    This location is bigger than the Tempe location.  There are several longer tables in the front, several tables on a patio outside, as well as tables along the corridor and, if you choose, there is the bar where you can watch them prepare your food.  The servers are friendly and knowledgable.  It is a causual atmosphere.  I have been here many times and always had great service.  The have many beers on tap but sadly, nothing local.  I would bump it up one more star if they added a couple of local brews.  And they know how to pour a pint of Guiness!  It's a great spot to hang out and have a pint or two and when you get hungry take a look at the 3 page menu.  You will have a hard time choosing so you'll have to come back again and again.....  If you like the English Pub feel, this is the place for you.  This would be my \"local\" if I lived closer but it is close enough to lure me here frequently. And if you've had a long day and would like some take out, you can do that too.  They will do a half bake on a pasty for you then you take it home and bake it for about 20 minutes and viola! dinner!   And even though I was just there yesterday, I am craving another!  Maybe it's because I'm part Welch and Irish.  Thank you Cornish Pasty Company!!",

    "text": "Best advice - eat before you come here. We waited over an hour for our food on a night that was not at all busy. Our waitress disappeared after taking our order, and we never saw her again. After a while, another waitress asked us if we'd ordered, and I said that we had, a long time ago. She checked and said it would be out soon, but didn't apologize for the long wait.  We both got bangers & mash, which apparently come pre-made, so we were perplexed as to why we had to wait so long for it. And because they come pre-made, it is not possible to just get the bangers and mash separately (without the glutinous pasty shell). So I had to dig the contents out, finding that there was precious little contents compared to the pasty. What was there was good, complemented by the red wine gravy that other reviewers have raved about.  The salad and chips (steak fries) were very tasty, and the lemonade was very lemony. The ambiance was nice, with the pub lit by candles dripping over wine bottles, and new age cello music seeping out of the house speakers.  Will I come back? Perhaps, if I'm not that hungry and can wait an hour for the food to arrive, and if I want to make a meal out of gluten-free side dishes. I came here with a craving for bangers & mash, and will keep looking. There *have* to be good ones on this side of the pond.",

We got them delivered (later to be removed from the bill), as we were finishing the pasties (pronounced with a soft a by the way...).

The atmosphere was rich, the food was great, the service was friendly and the music was phenomenal. I don't know how they choose their tunes but it was the perfect soundtrack to a unexpectedly pleasant evening. I don't like to use the word \"hip,\" but there's almost no better word to describe the experience. This is a great place to take friends and/or family.  Since the pasty's are cut in half, my friend and I decided to order something different and then split. Seeing as it is November and Thanksgiving is just around the corner, we went with 'The Pilgrim' (roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing), and to see how they handle mainstream, we also got the 'Royale With Cheese' - yes, that is an amazing name. It's essentially 'their cheeseburger.'  I had half of each, two glasses of Kronenbourg 1664, and I must say it was one of the best meals I have had in a restaurant in some time. The service was incredible - friendly, personal, and quick - and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to everyone I know, as tempting as it is to keep such a wonderful location as \"our little secret.\"",

I love so many of  their pasties, I feel guilty repeating one. Weird, I know.   I love the $3 Sunday mimosas. I love the pews. I love the greasy Jameson bottles covered in wax. I love the old doors as tables. I love that the wait staff doesn't wear a lame uniform. I love that you can sit at the bar and watch them prepare food. I love their outside patio.   So much to love.  ...all that said, this place has some of the worst service I have ever experienced. The wait staff is neither trained nor professional. They range from indifferent to down right rude. I'd like to say the poor service was a one time thing. Nope. Crappy service here is more dependable than the mail.  I give this place millions of chances because the food is so yummy but I'm nearing the end of my tenure as a customer of the Mesa location of Pasty.  Maybe Tempe will be better to me. I hope so. I think I may have to say goodbye to Mesa.",

The service staff was great, fast and friendly. The place was so clean and just bright and airy. I would love to come back for their happy hour sometime and try all their imports. Loved all the historical facts in the menu. Just an all around cool place.   As for the food...delish. My husband and I split The Italian and The Bangers and Mash. First off the crust on both was amazing. What a great flavor, and crispy yet soft at the same time.   The Italian was pretty good for being in a British place. If you're looking for a Stromboli or calzone, stick with La Famiglia or Old Chicago, but for the most part, it was pretty damn tasty. Loved the roasted tomatoes on it.   The Bangers and Mash..well I had my half of that second, and I'm so glad I did. I'm still savoring the delicious red wine gravy that you pour over the pasty. And I'm always a mashed potato fan. The sausage had an excellent flavor and the whole thing just went together nicely. Yum...SO GOOD.   I can't wait to back and try more!   Oh and a really cool feature...the waitress noticed my husband was on his lunch hour and we were sort of hurried, so she gave us a menu and said next time we come to order ahead and they'd have them ready when we got in. I love that kind of service.   Definitely will be going back.",

I realize the Nestle Company has sold billions of these nasty things since the 70's, but I don't want to go to a restaurant and eat Hot Pockets.  After reading the incredible reviews about this place I could not resist.   Not much to the outside of the place and seriously I would not have given the place a chance if I was driving by.  Inside is comfortable and inviting.  We were asked to seat ourselves and the server was over to take our drink orders almost immediately.  They have a good selection of mostly beers but the real focus here is the food.  35 or so combinations of pastry filled pies which makes deciding a bit difficult.  If you go you may want to check out the menu online beforehand or be prepared to browse the menu for awhile.  Our choice was the steak & cheese and one filled with sausage.  Both were incredible.  On the side, we had a choice of red wine gravy or mustard cream.  I asked our server which one she recommended and she said she would bring both.  Wow...funny I had not thought of that, but glad she did as both sauces were delicious. With a valley full of so-so restaurants it is always refreshing to find a truly good place to eat.",

I've been trying to try this place for years, I pleaded.   Boddingtons on tap makes me happy, the Pasty I chose was the asiago chicken with roasted green chili, double happy. Hubby had lamb with a mint sauce, he ate the entire thing, amazing, then had a big fat nap when we got home.  The interior is diner-like they do have much more seating than the Tempe spot (church pews with tables) and a patio at this location. I wouldn't mind coming back for a patio-beer day.

    "text": "I've never been to Scotland but I was told that this place or yet type of food is sort of Scottish. So let's see.  Yummie food!! Been here a few times with the hubbie, friends for happy hour and birthday.   There are 2 locations of this place in the valley and my favorite one is the one in Guadalupe Rd. As you walk in, it seems like you went back in 1800. Place is very warm with black and white paint as their primary colors. There are long tables with long white candles with melted wax still attached on the side that makes it very old yet beautiful. They use church pews as part of the long tables making the furniture very unique. Service is good and fast. They will take time to explain to you if you're first timers. Menu has a fair amount of selection according to their signature to the most popular pasties, they even have a full page of selection for vegans! Pasties are like calzone in a way or empanada in some countries, where you have meat stuffed inside a flour based dough. And they can out whatever kind of flavor they wanna put it! My favorites are the pesto chicken and chicken alfredo pasties! I also love, love, love the oven baked chips which are basically potatoes cut in wedges, baked to perfection and sprinkled with garlic or some jalapenos for those who are looking for some kick..You will not go wrong with these chips! My hubbie loves their Guinness which he says is very different from other restaurants, which I would say is True coz he has tried all kinds of this from all different places. They also have a good amount of beers that originated from Europe.  Pricing is fair enough for the big servings they give. I usually come home with half of my pasty so that's really big serving! =)  I recommend this place if you're looking for something new and fresh without shelling out too much $$..",

I love sitting with strangers in the pews! Honestly, I wish i worked here, it has a great vibe! I see this company expanding across the valley!  Food: You can't go wrong! Almost everything comes with its unique sauce to dip in. The desert menu, i feel needs some work. The one with the bananas, yes its good, but anyone could make it at home.  BEST THING ON THE MENU!!! Sounds weird...but the baked broccoli and cauliflower appetizer. Its hot, cheesy...and healthy all at the same time!",

    "text": "Countless pasties later and I'm back for an update.  The patio had some issues so the owners (who are awesome) tore out the glass top long tables outside and added huge (seats 6+) booths with flower pots on top with cushion seats and backs.  They've added more \"dessert\" pasties, plus more side dishes and salads.  Sunday's now feature breakfast pasties, a bloody mary bar and mimosas.  They are doing a lot more with this location than with the original Tempe shop, which I assume is because of the added space. Whatever the reason, they are doing it right.  If you want to get the expanded Cornish Pasty Co experience, take a few extra minutes and hit the Mesa location. It WILL be worth your time.",

    "text": "Like everyone else it seems, the Cornish Pasty Company came as a suggestion from a friend, I have been meaning to try it out for a while.  First of all the decor was awesome. The church pews, industrial purse hooks, tile, candle wax candles and large photos of English industrial workers really set the mood. The servers were relaxed, helpful and friendly. The music wasn't what you normally hear in a restaurant, but I LIKED that about it.   The drink selection is very good I think, lots of neat import beers and they'll do a taster sample if you want one. I love ciders, so I ordered the Strongbow, it was a bit on the warm side, but nothing to be too upset about.  I'm not a foodie by any means, I'm rather bland when it comes to trying new things, so I stuck with a \"safe\" menu item, Chicken Pot Pie. It was pretty good, although I was hoping for more of a cream based sauce, but that's a personal preference thing I think.   We also ordered the Caramel Apple dessert pastry. That was yummy! But it was odd that they served it with chocolate chip ice cream instead of vanilla as mentioned on the menu, perhaps they were out?   Anyhow, I would recommend the Cornish Pasty Company to anyone looking for something new, a little different and perhaps an tasty adventure of sorts.",

    "text": "First off, I LOVE THE FOOD. So giving this place three stars breaks my heart. I've been to this and the Tempe location each a few times. I do prefer this location because it feels more spacious.  I dropped in for lunch between meetings and sat at the bar facing the open kitchen. And then I waited. Somewhere around 12-15 minutes passed. I almost got up and walked out, but the guy in the kitchen manning the oven noticed I was still sitting without a beverage and asked whether I'd been helped yet. He offered to get me something to drink and took my food order.   The restaurant was not too busy, and there were a few servers wandering around. Around the time my food was ready, one of the servers sat at the far side of the bar to eat lunch. I finished my pasty and had to go to the cash register to pay. I probably shouldn't have tipped, but I used to be a server, thus feel massive guilt for not doing so.   Moral of the story, I'll probably just order to go next time and eat in my car. I hate when good restaurants are held back by poor service.",

Although when I asked for a take-home box, the waitress asked if i'd like more sauce!!!! whooo hooo - heck YES i want more sauce!!  My date had the Mexican -- pasty.  It was nice and spicy!!

After a night out with friends we decided (I convinced) that we should check it out for dessert.  I heard about the PB&J pasty so I wanted to try.  We showed up at 10pm on a Friday and the seating was ample for our group of 8.  The chairs are church pews and the decoration/ambience is really, really well done.    The staff is extremely nice and helpful (and fast).  We had a few Banoffee (which although sounds like coffeee, has nothing of the sort in it) and PB&J desserts which were great.  Admittedly the PB&J was really, really sweet.  But I still ate it all.  I can't wait to come back for their other food for lunch/dinner.  I was recommended to try the Royale with Cheese pasty upon return (an homage to Pulp Fiction, of course).  Try this place out!  I don't drink, but looked like a great hang-out if you do.",

    "text": "I went here because it seemed to be highly revered among the Yelp community, but found that it didn't quite meet up to the standard I was expecting.  -The food: I ordered the Oggie and their garlic chips. I thought the pasty tasted pretty good - nothing to write home about, but still good. The chips, on the other hand, were not crispy at all  (almost chewy), and had an absurd amount of garlic.  -The service: It wasn't a very crowded day, so I suppose I expected a little bit better service than some others had experienced. I was wrong - the service was sub-par, to say the very least.  First, our waiter took ages to even recognize us - and our food took even longer (far longer than most places I've ever been to, I should say). As soon as we got the pasties, he realized that he'd forgotten the chips. Not a big deal, except that the chips didn't arrive until we had completely finished our meals.  I should also mention that at least a few of the people working there looked blatantly stoned (in fact, I'm fairly sure one of the waiters was smoking a joint on the patio during his break).   -The atmosphere: The first thing that comes to mind is the very bad smell inside. It's a cross between spit and feet. Because of this, I sat outside, which was decent, aside from being surrounded by a cloud of smoke (still better than spit/feet though).   Wow, this review makes me sound like an overly critical prick, and I'm usually fond of \"hip\" places : \\ . Maybe I came at the wrong time, but honestly, the only thing keeping this from being a one-star review is the taste of the pasty.",

Finally waitress returned to take order and told us half of what we ordered was no longer available. After the waitress took our order she returned to tell us one more thing was no longer available, seems they had run out of just about everything. She did bring us free bread to soften the blow of being out of one other thing. Although the waitress was nice enough they just didn't seem to have enough service for such a busy night. I would definitely try it again because the food was spectacular but the service really needs to be worked on.",

Table was very uncomfortable, not fun, but, not the end of the world. After my party of 4 was seated, it took 20+ min to get a server to get our orders, after I had to go find the hostess and ask for one. We ordered our food, no substitutions mind you ,as these are all made in advance and sometimes they run out. We ordered and got our drinks a few min later. 30 min later my Dad's chips were brought to us even though he asked for them with his meal, it was a side after all. Then another 20+ minuets and 3 soda refills later our food finally came out. It was decent, though just past warm, not as hot as I would have liked. We didn't get our food until around 7-715 PM. I won't bother going back again because of the service or lack thereof. We had planned on getting deserts all around but opted not too as 90+ min on the extremely uncomfortable table was more than enough. We were all standing by the end as we waited another 15 min for our bill.",

WE also ordered a side of their oven chips, which are like proper English chips (fries, for the uneducated) and a side of gravy.

    "text": "British food? In Mesa? Doing successfully in one of the most cursed plaza's in Mesa history? Yes, yes and yes, apparently...  I've always wanted to try a pasty...glad I was finally able to. On walking in, you realize the place is so British, that there's actually a bit of culture shock. The big long tables and benches may have you questioning whether or not you should sit down at one of these tables with an already seated party, and the answer is YES, you should! Thats how its done on the other side of the pond, and thats how its done at the Cornish Pasty Co.  They have a pretty good beer selection. My party of 3 split a large greek salad, and we could have used another one or two mouths to help us out. The dressing it comes with is a lemon pesto salad dressing, which was delicious. A word of caution, however: A little goes a long way. Its pretty thick, potent stuff. But it really does go well with the red onion, olives and feta in the salad.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, and later I was also able to try the Chicken Pesto pasty. Both were very very good, but I liked the Tikka Masala a little better. It seemed like it was a very popular choice there as well. I would say on both pasties, the side dressings left a little to be desired. The tikka masala comes with their version of raita, a traditional indian yogurt dressing, but their flavor (while not tasting bad) did seem kinda off for some reason. The pesto chicken came with marinara, and again it seemed a little off.  The clientele here is a pretty mixed bag. The servers are the tatt'd up, facial piercings type, which Im not sure exactly why that is, but I dont mind it. Im not judging anyone, but there seemed to be a lot of lesbians in the place too. I have not a clue why either would be the case, but It didnt bother me--just struck me as odd. The place at 5:30 was PACKED. You come any later and you WILL NOT get a seat.  One last thing that I would like to mention is that for the vegetarians out there, this place is extremely veg-friendly. Practically an entire page of their menu is dedicated to pasties with quorn fake meat products, which although I didnt try, Im sure would be fantastic.  I will definitely be back soon, though maybe next time Ill try lunch and see if its maybe a little less crowded.",

I liked that the crust wasn't super heavy, but a thin shell.  The yogurt dip was good, too.  My husband said his potato soup was also quite delicious.  We both enjoyed the banoffee pie, although the crust was overbaked and too hard, but I just scooped up everything else and left the crust alone.  Hibiscus tea was good and refreshing.  Customer service was friendly but spotty.  My waitress was okay, but some of the others were mostly talking to people and not working, leaving the others to pick up the slack.",

Maybe not *quite* as tasty as the ones I had at a place in London, but close, and this requires a significantly shorter trip. I make it a point to stop here whenever I'm in the area.",

    "text": "I really wish I had the option for a 4.5 rating. The Cornish Pasty, Co. has been a date-spot as well as a casual hangout of mine for years now. The best thing about the Pasty (pronounced \"Pass-Tee\") is not only the amazingly simple food, but the elegant atmosphere. Where else can you dine under candlelight without feeling like a chump? The lighting is dim and beautiful, the surroundings simple yet quaint. You can get the full story behind what a Pasty is inside every menu, and I recommend reading about it! Interesting stuff! The prices are very consistent throughout the menu, typically being around $9 per dish, which is very acceptable considering the density and beauty of the food.   The staff is typically friendly, with the occasional \"I'm having a bad day\" server. It can be hard to tell who is a server, as they wear simple street clothes, but I believe this adds to the welcoming feel that the owner, Dean, has established. Apparently renovations are to be coming soon, with the restaurant expanding to almost double the current size. I'm anxious to see how this will affect the overall mood of the place, but also excited for change.   There are no TV's here, so don't expect to go watch a game. You do however have a nice range of beer and wine choices, with a limited liquor selection. I was told that the bar will expand with the addition.   Date? Go! Hangout with friends? Go! Take mom out to dinner? Go! I can't think of any circumstance that this place doesn't cater to. (oh yeah, and they also actually cater to parties as well, which I believe can be requested through their website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornishpastyco.com%2Fmenu%2Findex.html&s=1ea39836796ac2856935b3d019aff7a4ab3a87514b0f8d4b2469e056303af182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cornishpastyco.com/menu/...</a> along with a full menu.

The only negative is that it takes a long time for the food to come, once ordered. However, the wait is worth it.

Perhaps it is because we could actually see everything clearly in the restaurant versus the darkness of the Tempe store.  There is also a nice, large patio that is equipped with heat lamps for the cooler months.  That is a definite plus.  The only reason I am not upping this to 5 stars is we found our food portions to be about 3/4 the size (or less) of the pasties at the Tempe location.  It was strange.  Everyone noticed the difference.  Whereas we had ample leftovers at the Tempe location, none of us had leftovers at the Mesa location.  The size of the food was adequate, it just was not what we expected.  We were still hungry even though we ordered an appetizer.  That is really unlike us!  Still, the food was delicious.  We will definitely be visiting this location again soon.  Also, it should be noted that the waitstaff was extremely friendly and helpful in selecting our pasties.  This is a definite advantage over the waitstaff at the Tempe location that just wanted to rush us into ordering without offering up any suggestions.",

It's that unhealthy meat and potatoes comfort food without the guilt of eating an animal, I can only speak to their vegan vegetarian options. Their pub fries are so tasty with jalapenos and garlic and they are oven baked and better than fried. Oh and their deserts are so good you may cry tears of joy. I don't eat out much but when I do and get to pick I happily pick this lovely spot with a fantastic beer selection and nice vibe/ atmosphere. Service leaves something to be desired but quality of food is what I care about.",

Delicious food, ultra cool comfortable ambience, delicious brew and super nice staff, even if perhaps a little slow sometimes.  Seat yourself and enjoy, I tried the Cottage Pie first, which was good, my hubby ordered the Chicken Pesto, it was great.  Next time around I got the Oggie and there is definitely a reason this is first on their menu, soooooo delicious, like a delicious beef stew in a crust, newbies start here! The Cheesesteak is also soooo delicious, my husband hasn't ventured outside of that one since he first tried it cause he doesn't believe anything will ever taste as delicious. Their fries/chips are okay, and I've only tried their soup with black beans which was tasty and spicy.  definitely save room for dessert because the apple caramel pasty haunts my daydreams, its that good.  Unfortunately my pre-holiday guilt is kicking in so I'm gonna have to cut back to only going every other week so as not to tip the scales soon but I will definitely make my way through their entire menu eventually and report back =)",

    "text": "I'm so torn over the rating! The food was fantastic! I had the Cottage Pie, my husband had the Carne Adovado. Both were rich, tasty, and well-made, but the service was dismal! It took 10 minutes for our waitress to approach the table, which wasn't initially a problem but the service only went downhill from there. It took a half-hour to get our food, and our server never checked on drinks, we sat there with empty glasses and drinks with no ice, finally went to the bartender for refills. Again, the food was awesome! With my husband being a pastry chef we always want to try desserts and ordered the Bonaffee Pie and the Apple Pasty, after we ordered we waited...and waited...and waited, no sign of our server, finally waved down another server he checked and our desserts were right there! Again, our server nowhere to be seen, still empty glasses. After waiting for so long we weren't really interested in our desserts anymore unfortunately, then surprise! Suddenly our server was there with the bill!! After not seeing her for 40 minutes she drops the bill, doesn't offer boxes, no conversation, just drops the check. After we paid, she hovered at the next table which was empty and took the check before we were even completely out of our seat.      So TL;DR         For our first time here, food was excellent, but service was so bad we won't be back! I'll give the Tempe location a try, hopefully service will be better, but I won't go back to the Mesa location again.",

    "text": "My daughter and I just had lunch an hour ago at the Guadalupe and Dobson location, we had never been there before and wanted to try it.  So there was a staff of about 12 people between bartenders, wait staff and kitchen staff, only 5 tables of customers.  My first impression was \"gosh this place is dirty and old\".  Torn chair seats, stuff all over the floor, windows incredibly filthy, outside patio yuck...But, in the interest of the food, decided to continue to a small table next to the gross window.  The table top was an old door with a piece of glass over it, cute idea until you look at how stains of old food and drink (obviously from spills) had gotten under the glass and were not cleaned up.  The waitress met us and presented our menus, and took our drink order (water and iced tea).  Three pages of my menu fell out, they were so old that the glue no longer kept them in the menu book.  After about 20 minutes, the waitress came to take our order the rest of the time, she and the other 7 \"non kitchen\" help were standing in a group in the back of the restaurant laughing and talking about personal stuff (we could hear them loud and clear)...a bit perturbed that it took 20 minutes to get our order placed.  Not once did she ask to refill our tea or water....  Really feel like the staff should be doing more than standing around bullshitting.  How about pick up a rag and clean? Sweep? Mop? Wipe down the fan blades (disgusting)?  The pasties that we had were good...but ambiance, cleanliness, service...no way!",

I was glad to see that the restaurant is doing well and remodeled their two locations with more locations coming soon.   The food at Cornish Pasty is impeccable. I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet.   The atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place. It's good for dates as well. $5 mid shelf and always $3 Irish Car bombs with lots of microbrews on draft? YES PLEASE.   The one thing I hate about Cornish Pasty, and the reason why I give it 2/5 is the SERVICE SUCKS. It must be a requirement to be a hipster with 5+ visible tattoos/piercings with a poor work effort. You even get a raise for having poor personal hygiene! I've been eating at Cornish Pasty for 5 years and have never received good service. Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.  If you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch.",

The menu looked interesting and the high review scores were promising.  We went on a Thursday night and got there for a late dinner after running some other errands about 8:00.    When I first walked in, I thought they might be closing because ninety percent of the dining room was empty and had been blocked off.  But a guy by the door - who I eventually figured out worked there - said it would only be a minute for the table.  So I gave him my name and we waited.  After about 10 minutes, he came by and told us they were clearing a table.  10 minutes later he said that again.  After 30 minutes of waiting, he admitted that he had no idea when seating would be available.  We gave up and left - the Thai food next door was fantastic.  If they had just been upfront and told us that most of their seating was unavailalbe, we would have placed a to-go order.  But don't say you're clearing a table if there isn't really a table...",

The 2nd cup didn't even have the bread crumbs, AND we got charged for the second cup. - For being a large group, they accommodated pretty well, but their social skills could be turned up a notch.

We met for lunch with his longtime friend (and my new friend) Gary (who is, among other things, a novelist...I want to see how he works me and CPC into a book:)  I was pretty hungry after spin class this morning and the waitstaff at CPC wasted no time in getting the retox going for me...I think service has improved since I was here last and food remains authentic and excellent!  Neither Jim or Gary had ever been to CPC before, but they both handled their pasty's like pro's and the three of us all joined the CPC - \"CPC\" (\"Clean Plate Club\"...I think there's an award ceremony at the end of the year:)  Jim had an Oggie and Gary tried a Greek Something Pasty and both were fortified against the rigors of the remainder of Friday afternoon (Jim had some sort of \"human heart thingy\" he had to do, and I had to come back to my office and type on my computer...who has the more stressful job...really? :-).  Finally, the people at CPC all continue to be so darn happy and pleasant...I so often see people working at restaurants that look like they hate being there (and probably do) that it's worth noting when everybody from the cooks to the servers all have smiles on their  faces and in their voices.

    "text": "I had been contemplating visiting this place to try their pasties when the mood finally struck. It was in the midst of winter rainstorms that were apparently the worst Arizona has seen in the last two decades. That didn't stop this place from being quite busy and packed with patrons.  My own reasoning for braving the weather probably has to do with childhood memories of pasties. I was introduced to these delights while living in Holland. I attended an international school (NATO brat) and the cafeteria food service was managed by the British, so pasties were always available. It also rains quite often in Holland, so my craving for a good pasty may be inextricably linked to rainy weather.  The Cornish Pasty Company did not disappoint. I had the lamb vindaloo pasty and a Pinstripe Red Ale from Colorado. The beer selection here is impressive and seems to be quite a draw, since I got the impression that the crowd here was suitably beer-literate. The vindaloo was quite spicy but delicious and the beer complemented it perfectly. The quality of the pasty was perfect... piping hot filling, flaky crust.  All in all, I was happy to discover a great place nearby to eat and drink. Maybe next time I won't even wait for it to rain.",

    "text": "I first discovered Cornish Pasty at the Tempe location in 2006.  The food has always been delicious, so I was thrilled when they opened a location closer to home.  The food is still good, but there are two issues with this location that really need to be addressed.  First, as other reviewers have noted, there is a really bad odor inside the restaurant.  It almost smells like bad feet.  I don't know if its a particular food that is making that bad smell or what, but because of it, we always opt to eat outside.  When you enter a restaurant you should be greeted with a cornucopia of deliciousness -not a weird stench that makes you want to run.  Secondly, the customer service.  This is consistently - inconsistent.  Sometimes its ok, and then other times its just plain terrible.  The other night we had to wait 1 1/2 hours for our food and we didn't see our waitress for over an hour--that's right-AN HOUR--no drink refills, nada.  In fact we almost just left.  I don't care how busy you are, that is unacceptable.  If the customer service was excellent, I could overlook the 5 earrings in the nose-20 tats-freak show waiters they have serving the customers. (ok, so they ARE friendly for the most part)  But bad service, coupled with hippie freaky waiters is starting to wear thin.  I really want to give this place 5 stars because their food is wonderful, but until they get their customer service up to par and get rid of that smell. this place is never going to be in my top 5.",

Our service is typically wonderful with some rare exceptions, our food is always delicious, and their beer selection is great for beer lovers like us.

    "text": "As someone who does not eat nonkosher meat, Cornish pasty has a ton of vegetarian selections and a salmon selection.  Their pasties are so perfectly cooked,  so flaky, have no grease, and always taste fresh.  I always order the vegetarian traditional pasty (forgot what its called) that has fake ground meat, cheddar cheese, mashed potatoes, and peas.  It is great..  Such good flavors all mixed together in that perfect dough.  Also, it costs less than 10$!  The negatives are that a pasty is not quite enough to fill me up for dinner, and they do not come with anything.  The soups are pretty good though, especially the walnut one.  I am not a fan of any of their sides that I have tried such as the oven baked chips or beans.  You are better off ordering 2 pasties and taking the leftovers home rather than ordering a pasty and a side.",

I had potato leek soup, bread, curried potatoes, and a lamb mint pastie. I chose a pint of 1664 followed by a Guinness, both fresh on tap. I liked the candles in bottles with heavy wax drippings . . . Except. Except the proprietors chose vodka bottles with the hammer and  sickle. No big deal if you approve of the worst mass murderers in history.  If it is supposed to be daring or chic, try swastika festooned decor; same reality.",

Sorry, it smelled like sewage. I've worked at many restaurants. Second, the church pews we sat in were filthy. No excuse. Third, a small roach scampered off the side of the table when I sat down.

The ambiance is kinda 70's feel, funky, chill including the wait staff. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We took all her suggested favorites to heart and ordered the Peppered steak, the Cheese Steak and The Pilgrim. We also tried their Bloody Mary's which were very good! The Pasties were all to die for! Served hot, juicy, but not soggy. The actual pastry was light and flaky, the side sauces and gravy were all yummy. Me and my daughter each took a half home. Very filling but not heavy. This is one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Can't wait to go back and try more varieties and one of their desserts. We will definitely return here!",

After a random Google search, I found this place..followed by a quick lookup of reviews on Yelp.  Let me tell you, the excellent reviews on Yelp are spot on!  Today was my first visit.  I ordered 2 pasties for pickup during my lunch hour, as I figured I'd eat half of each one and save the rest for dinner(IF it was any good).  I got the Cheese Steak(10 out of 10) and the Shepherd's Pie(8 out of 10).  After a 15 minute drive back to work, they were still piping hot!  And the taste absolutely blew me away.  The Cheese Steak was PHENOMENAL....it will be hard not to order that the next few times I go, but eventually I'd like to try the many other creations they have.  I've heard their Happy Hour is fantastic, so I intend on rounding up some friends to check that out sometime soon!",

I can't recommend one specific dish because I've had 'em all and have a difficult time choosing one specific item. Just make sure you order a few side dishes because they really bring your meal together. And the chefs will make any item as spicy as you prefer! By far the best place to eat in Mesa!",

The servers are tastefully rude in a way that is amusing and contributes to the dark atmosphere. Everything inside is dark, old, and antiquely, which together with the black and white gothic portraits an candlestick lighting makes you feel like you're in an alfred hitchcock movie.  The food is outstanding. I had some kind of mexican food pasty and every bite was delicious. If you've never been here and are a fan of anything alternative or outside of the box, I highly recommend you try this restaurant.",

    "text": "The actual pasty was great, the dough they use and how they cook it is delicious. The atmosphere is dark and bleak and I guess going for that old-time English pub feeling. The servers are all hipsters so if your grandma isn't into seeing tattooed guys with beards and skinny jeans or girls with septum piercings she might not appreciate the experience. Personally, I don't care I was here for the vegan options.  The problem with a pasty is that they are pre-made so you cannot change anything, meaning you cannot add or take any ingredient away. Unfortunately for me I only think it's average because of this. If you're not a Veg then you will probably enjoy it, or if you eat cheese because almost all their vegetarian choices have cheese...and they sound delicious! I'm probably just pissy because the menu says 2 Vegan options daily and they only had 1.",

I could literally taste each if the flavors, chicken, basil,bell peppers roasted, mushroom marinated and mozzarella The  distinct  flavours meld into something extremely delicate at the same time very refined, like some sort of a concoction of deliciousness. And it is extremely filling too. It was like having multiple orgasms inside my mouth, the best pasty ever! Granted I was hungry after tennis, and I am not some rich connoisseur of taste, but I can see good food when it meets my mouth, and this place is just pure gorgeousness. A must visit and your mouth will thank you for it!!",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty used to be our go to and a place we would tell everyone about. A place to go with friends and bring co-workers, and tell family about... And I do think this place is unique with a cool atmosphere and generally speaking the food is okay. And though usually the service is slow, forgetful, and lets be honest- sub par... we had a pretty good waitress today.  However, once she left her shift-- we were not checked up on or given coffee or water refills... for only... hmmm... 7 hours. My husband and I were catching up with a friend we hadnt been able to get together with in awhile...  and having great conversation... and the place was VERY empty today, on a Saturday.The outside was desolate, and there were at least four plus empty tables inside and a mostly empty bar on our way out. Not a good sign for business on a Saturday night. We kept waiting for someone to come over and offer us more water... we wanted to get some drinks, dinner, and dessert since we were there so long-- but NO ONE came to our table in all of that time. And no, I am not chasing down a waiter at a resteraunt to get service! One guy (the owner?) came to our table and lit the candle but did not offer any drinks or food seeing our glasses and to go boxes empty... he walked by us multiple times! Then the service folks decided to start looking our way and whispering... ( instead of trying to get a higher tab, funny) and a large group came in and was glaring at us (though there were many empty tables and couches in our vicinity). So we decided to leave- I mean it is hotter than hell in there, you can not feel the air conditioning!! This is Arizona come on people! No water!! I am so over this place. We literally sat there with money to spend and no service! We were testing them after awhile, waiting to see if someone would come over. We gave them every chance. I guess we will spend our money elsewhere. And I definitley will not be referring this place to anyone anymore as the food has also been going downhill for awhile. We got the pilgrim which was luke warm and mushy... and just not very flavorful. And the meat and cheese was crumbly and tasted like mince meat instead of sausage. Enough is enough.",

    "text": "In the mood for something different than Mexican & sushi. Saw the 4.5 Yelp review, not a fan of anything British as a general rule, but what the heck, all the Yelpers can't be wrong, & they served food until MIDNIGHT!  Frankly, I expected it to be \"good, but not my style,\" as I prefer lighter, healthier food for the most part, NOT a \"meat & potatoes person.\"  Went there alone since my family wasn't with me. I was a very \"un-hipster\" 40-ish yr old female alone. As I walked up I noted the loud patio, people having fun/drinking, hmm. Inside: dark but not in a seedy way, real wax dripped down the wine bottles holding the candles. Church pew seating as mentioned. Pretty cool, but the tables looked huge & daunting for this SWF diner. The outside looked too \"party\".   No one really approached me right away, a few people said hi, but they all looked so casual sans uniform, I couldn't quite tell if they worked there or just walking by?  Didn't know if I should wait to be seated, but there was really no obvious place to wait for such guidance, as the front door leads right into the dining room. After a few awkward seconds I identified that guy as definitely an employee & threw myself at his mercy, \"Hi. I'm new. How does this work?\"  He was great, sit anywhere. Grabbed a seat at the end of the raised bar. As someone else said, a good place to bolt from if things didn't go well. Also had a good view of the dining room, the kitchen prep area & the servers work area.   Friendly Serena stopped by, I warned her too that I was new. She was great! Since they clearly have a great, well-chosen list of ales & beers & that seems an obvious British accompaniment to pastys, I told her some of the beers I normally liked, such as IPAs, Kiltlifter, Dogfish Head 60 & 90. She lit up & said she's bring a sample of one she thinks I'd like. Love the service already!! I love love love when they bring samples of something so you can truly decide before committing. She NAILED IT - On-tap Green Flash Hop Head Red. Never heard of it, LOVE IT.  Ordered the Chicken Tika Masala pasty since I was in the international mood & Yelpers said it was good. Waited the 15 mins or so. Noticed that the servers have fun, the kitchen is friendly like everyone says, the crowd is diverse.  The music is great, stuff I like, upbeat, some good swing-dancing music, Stray Cats, etc. Only thru Yelp reviews did I learn it's now \"hipster\" music, ha ha. Then arrived the pasty...  SOOOO much better than a typical calzone crust! I love how thin but sort of crisp the crust is! Nothing even close to doughy, it's lightly holding the divine insides. The Chicken was moist and chunky, the tikka masala sauce was spiced but not \"hot,\" really savory flavor.  The side sauce was perfect with it, nice touch that they all have various perfect accompaniment sauces! I asked Serena for a box right away to take the other half home to family. Good thing I did, or I would have stuffed myself with it because it was sooo tasty & been in pain later.  I'm also not really much of a dinner-out dessert person, as they are usually too over the top gooey sweet for me. But the Banoffee Pie with bananas caught my eye. Home-made caramel? In home-made graham crust? What??  Argh, okay....  I can have a few bites & take the rest home.  Serena was again brilliant, telling the kitchen to \"build it\" in the to-go container. Once it arrived, I could see why, truly awesome suggestion, as moving it would have messed it all up. The guy behind the counter asked,  \"Just bananas or also strawberries?\" I deferred to Serena the Expert... \"Plus strawberries.\"   He told me when busy, he doesn't have time to create this masterful work of art that he made, but tonight he was able to do so. It was beautiful, and tasted 10 times better. I couldn't stop. I didn't know why. Finally, another server stopped by and we chatted about it. The secret is: the caramel is sweet, the graham crust is both sweet & salty, & the whipped cream isn't sweetened at all. The balance is WONDERFUL! Scary-wonderful: \"...just one more bite, then I will close the box...\"  Thanks, Cornish Pasty, will be back with many others really soon!!!",

The atmosphere is so grunge, dark and even the people working there are not your average joes, which I love. I always get a very interesting waiter and have a consistently good meal. Actually, it's beyond good, it's mouth watering amazing. The pastry always tastes fresh and is baked to perfection, and whatever you order to go inside of it is ALWAYS piping hot! The wine sauce is to die for as well, so don't be suh with it! And if you're still hungry by the time you're finished with your entree, which is almost impossible I've come to learn, the dessert menu looks incredible and I've had the peanut butter and jelly pasty (not as ordinary as it sounds) and it was a lovely way to end the meal!

    "text": "I don't exactly know how to describe a pasty if you've never had one before.  I had never even heard of them until recently, when I read a review of this place.  Always the adventurous type when it comes to food, I figured I'd give it a shot.  How bad could it be?  It's fantastic.  At it's simplest, a pasty is a beautifully filled pastry with meat, potatoes, veggies and some sort of sauce.  Like a chicken pot pie without the tin.  But better.  Oh so much better.  And if chicken isn't your thing, fear not - they have pasties of pretty much anything you could imagine!    We went this past Saturday to try it out.  I like the decor, cool black wall, love the church pews to sit at the communal tables - also a long bar or some small tables to sit at if communal seating isn't your bag, baby.    The menu is quite extensive, a few pages worth of different pasties - a full page dedicated to vegetarian options (certainly not for me, but good to know!).  They have a nice drink menu as well, I suppose depending on what you're looking for.  They nod their head to the winos with a pretty limited selection (think there were 4 different types, nothing too spectacular).  The beer list is extensive, and perfect for the setting and menu.  Lots of american and english brews, quite the variety actually.  And with the draft beers you get a choice of 14oz, 20oz or 32oz.  All of them decently priced.  (For the record, I had a Boddingtons and it was delicious).  $3 Irish car bombs, all the time.  (plus a couple other shot/drink specials) but that one jumped out at me.    To the food.  I had the Oggie, which is described as the traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes, onions and rutabaga with a red wine gravy.  It was brought to me with ketchup or more red wine gravy for additional moist-maker if you so choose.  It was great.  Steak was tasty, not too tough (i'm sure it's not filet mignon, but it was certainly good quality for a filler).  I'm still not sure what a rutabaga is, but I know I like it, at least in this dish!  Couldn't decide what I liked better the ketchup or gravy, so I went back and forth with each subsequent bite.    The wife had the spicy Asiago Chicken.  Perfectly cooked chunks of chicken breast with a slab of asiago cheese (melted and oh-so-gooey delicious), hatch chiles, black beans.  She was quite happy with this one.    We also ordered a side of the garlic \"chips\" which are pretty much oven baked french fries - just like an order of fish and chips.    We ended on the Chocolate bread and butter pudding served with creme anglaise and vanilla ice cream.  So decadent and quite tasty.  Perfect ending.  I can't wait to go back and try new varieties of the pasty.  The options seemed limitless.  Not to mention go back and drink all their beers and partake of the $3 car bombs.    Service was good, although the pasties take a few minutes to cook.  So don't expect it to be \"fast food.\"  Good food takes a bit of time to cook properly!  They told us about this when we ordered, so the delay was expected and welcomed (gave me more time to enjoy the Boddingtons!).",

It really looks like a spot I would have enjoyed going to in the Park Ave. area of Rochester, NY. The place has some communal seating (complete with vintage church pews as benches) and also an outdoor area for people who can't get enough of the heat (or like to smoke, I suppose).  The menu is vast - I was amazed at all the different pasty options I had. I do wish they had the traditional without rutabega, but I settled on one with beef, cheddar and potatoes instead. It was moist and flavorful and the crust was perfect. I know what a \"real\" pasty is and although these are slightly different than what I'm used to, they are definitely worth it.  One thing to note - thought not surprising - their beer selection is not run of the mill. I asked for a Bud Light and the server looked at me like I was from outer space. After she helpfully pointed out the options on their beer menu (with offerings from mostly European breweries) I had the opportunity to try something new, and I was happy for it.",

The food was amazing, the staff was efficient, friendly and attentive without being annoying and the desserts.... WOW. I usually don't have room for deserts, don't make this mistake, save room. The Shirley Temple pudding is not from this world. I am now a Pasty fan and will return for more culinary abuse. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the size of the dinning area. Although they have ample room on their patio, the seating inside is very limited. Most restaurants have enough seats so that as people finish, tables become available regularly. Here, there are 4 tables, so your wait time, if you want to eat inside, can be long. If you go before 5:30, you should be fine, if you go after 6, especially with 4 or more, prepare to wait. I myself will just go at 5:30, eat and be happy.",

I really don't care if they don't have a kids menu, but I could think of a few nicer responses.  -Our water glasses were rarely refilled. We're in AZ. It was about 100 that day, and we were sitting outside.  -The server said they don't split checks. Weird. They've done it other times I've been there.

Also Like the Tempe location, if you sit at the bar you'll see chefs hand making new pasties and the pride they put into each one.

I had the Chicken Tikka salad, which is two hefty, hot chicken breasts and the standard fair of lettuce, onions, etc.. Fresh! Crispy! Tasty! The folks both had the Sausage Salads which were even more incredible.. they pack like.. a pound of really tasty homemade sage sausage, with a really incredible creamy mustard dressing, all under $9 each!

    "text": "So without a single notion of what a Pasty actually was, I joined my usual \"Find unique and interesting places to eat\" group of friends to try this place out.  And boy am I glad I did.  We took a seat at the bar that overlooked the kitchen and I started off with a 20oz glass of one of my favorite wheat beers; Hoegaarden.    As we sat there watching one of the employees make a batch of Pasties, my friends and I chatted casually with himself and a few other employees about the place and what was good to eat and such.  Being adventurous I decided to try out one of the many veggie menu items and went with the Chicken Basil and Pesto Pasty.  It featured vegetarian chicken and I was curious as to how it would stack up against the real thing.  It was served quite prettily shortly after we ordered and I dug in.  Delicious!  The veggie chicken obviously wasn't a dead ringer for the real deal, but I felt it worked quite flawlessly with the rest of the contents of the dish.  After that we decided on different desserts and I chose the chocolate rum bread pudding.  It was different than any bread pudding I've ever had for starters because it was chocolate.  Next it had a crunchy outer shell that contained the gooey goodness inside.  I was informed that they were sadly out of the vanilla drizzle that normally accompanies it as well, so that would have also made it unique had they not been out.  It's also worth noting that the employees were an absolute blast to interact with as they were playing quirky and fun songs off their iPod and were just being outgoing and fun in general.  It was mentioned though that the manager was not there at the time and that usually had the place had more patrons (there were maybe 2 other couples in the place) in it they would have had to conform to more \"professional\" standards.    Overall it's a shame I live so far from the place because I could easily see myself becoming a regular.  Prices after pasty, dessert and 2 20oz beers and tip was just around 27 if I remember correctly.",

    "text": "When trying to decide where to meet some friends for dinner, Cornish Pasty was suggested and I excitedly agreed. I had read great reviews, so was happy to finally visit for myself.  The food was great- worth a four or even a five star review. There were a few things that really hurt the quality of the experience for me.  The seating at CPC is four sets of church pew seats around tables fashioned from large doors. What was frustrating is that each set of seats were occupied with really small groups of 2-4 people. The waitstaff could have easily asked people to move to one end of the pews or the other, and the length could easily hold two separate sets of diners without encroaching on either party's personal space. Instead, we stood and waited for 15 minutes.  Second, the temperature of the place was hot and muggy. Running some fans or turning up the AC a teeny bit would have made things more comfortable.  The music was really loud, and we had to shout over it to talk across the table. It seemed a little like they were trying to be more of a bar/hipster hangout than a restaurant.   The service left a bit to be desired, but I don't fault our sweet waitress. She was nice and as attentive as she could be, but admitted she was frazzled as there were only two on shift for the entire restaurant. Since I've only been once I don't know if that's the norm, but I hope not.  One important note- if you are a picky eater, take a look at their menu online and call ahead a few hours early for special orders. You can't make any substitutions as everything is made in advance and half-cooked, then finished cooking when ordered. A bit of a bummer though, because you have to order 2 for special orders.  Something that stood out in a great way was their entire page of vegetarian pasty selections. So awesome! I hadn't had a good shepherd's pie since ditching meat many years ago, so it was great to have a well made veggie version. If and when I return, I'll definitely try some of the other meatless pockets of deliciousness.  Also, the mushy peas were out of this world. Although, this is coming from someone who eats peas right out of the can.",

After we placed our orders one of the two pastys we ordered had ran out which kinda sucked. checked out the alcohol menu and seemed to have a large variety, and good deals for happy hour as well. food was okay, had the Alfredo pasty and the spicy asiago chicken. Was not anything that knocked my socks off, but it satisfied the hunger. like i said will probably give it another chance and try something else and def give the desert a chance because they look delicious!",

I had never had a pasty before and it kind of reminded me of a cross between a pot pie and a calzone.  But it was definitely better than the pot pies I remembered from Maries Calendar's!  It was delicious!  It gets crazy busy in the evening, so I suggest getting there early.",

I am a big guy and can easily put away a lot of food but I even have trouble finding room for this. The pasties are not a meal you can leave in a company fridge for long because someone will seal it. It is that good. Everyone I have ever taken to eat there has said at first the food can be a little rich for their taste but by time we leave they all tell me that they have found their new favorite eatery, that is saying something since a lot of the people I have brought over are from New York or Europe. On a further note there is a wide selection for almost anyone vegetarian included, the tea drinker, or even the ones of us that would like a little beer with our meal. Best of all $3 Irish Car Bombs for the win! I recommend this place to anyone, take your time meet the staff (most of them are heavily tattooed and/or pierced but they are great people kind and friendly and not just because they are paid to be).",

And of course you're asking, why a FIVER now?    Lemmie 'splain:  Even though things went sideways, our waitress did not falter under the pressure of said 'eff up.  She didn't avoid the issue or ignore my table and  she brought me a SECOND pasty for FREE along with my original (but slightly late) order.  Her course correction was done in record time (10 minutes or less), pretty amazing considering Pasty's take somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 mintues to cook (I could be wrong with my timing here)     Conclusion:  Ku-fucking-dos CPC.

Every bite is orgasmic. Excellent customer service. The place itself has a very weird atmosphere. I feel like the mood they're going for is: privacy. Like all the booths have really high dividers and it's really dimly Lit. So much so that when you walk back out into Arizona sunlight it came be rather disorienting, especially if you've just finished one of their giant mugs of beer, which are almost a necessity to accompany your meal and complete the cornish pasty experience. Damn it's been a good couple months since I've had any and writing this review has made me crave it immensely. I gotta wrap this up and head over there now. It's almost noon so it's probably a good time to start drinking. (don't let this fool you- it's not standard bar fare. You don't have to be drunk to enjoy this food. But the option is available.)",

We also had a more traditional pasty with steak, potatos, and rutabagas.  Very good in that whole comfort food kind of way.

This place is awesome and if you've never been...get off your ass and check it out!  Growing up in Michigan, the pasty is somewhat of a local food (by way of English immigrants). If you're from northern Michigan, the pasty is nothing new to you. However, the pasties we grew up with are not the pasties they serve here. Dean has taken the idea of the traditional pasty and put a totally high end, almost gourmet twist into the mix. Look for southwestern and Greek flavors as well as traditional English and Italian pasties. The Oggie or O.G. is awesome. Simple, traditional and good.   The staff is friendly, helpful and colorful! Check out the juke box witch contains mostly, if not all British bands. Just another nice touch.  Ahhh a Pasty and a Pint! Life is good.",

    "text": "When I use to work in London, I always looked forward to having a pint at the end of the day with my friends.   Besides their incredible food, Cornish Pasty has the feel that reminds me very much of an English pub. The food is the real star here, but the beers they have on tap are outstanding.   One of my favorite, is the north London brewer Fuller's Extra Special Bitter(ESB). It's fresh, tasty and took me back to the City pubs of my youth. Granted the beer back then was warmer. LOL  As we sat waiting for our server, you could see everyone was happy to be here. We sat near the bar, to the right of where the cooks are preparing the meals. Pretty soon all those dozen or so bar stools were taken. There was a lot of laughing. Folks being happy at the end of the work week and enjoying each others company. What a great atmosphere!  We started with the 20 oz/ pint of the Fuller's ($6.00) that I mentioned (photo) and glass of the Leitz Out ($6.50) Riesling. Both hit the spot nicely.   For dinner we ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty, along with the Rosemary Chicken pasty and shared some English Oven garlic chips ($3.50). I believe the chicken might have been the better of the two pasty, but not by much!  Both, had a sophisticate layering of flavors, that were subtle and very nice.  In the hands of a different Chef, you could see how the flavors might have overwhelm the palette. But not here. Surprising they were only $9.00 each. Incredible.   For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($6.00) and the Apple Carmel Pasty ($5.00). Both were also delicious.   Each of the above items were very filling. We couldn't finish them, or the desserts. So we had four \"to go\" boxes for later. I've posted several pictures and we really had a fun time.  Our bill came to a fair $49.07 including taxes, but before gratuities.   We'll be back. Enjoy!",

As the story goes, miner's wives would take the previous night's meal and make a turnover out of it with a pastry. Much like an italian calzone. I don't like how most of the waiters describe it as a \"fancy hot pocket\" but it gets the job done I guess. This restaurant has taken the traditional meals such as banger and mash but have also expanded the tradition to mexican style pasties, middle eastern, italian, and an extensive line up of vegetarian and vegan offering also. The appetizers are all delicious too, scotch egg, wings, etc... the food and atmosphere never disappoint here and I am always bringing clients from around the nation here to have them leave wishing one would open next to them! The food is filling, great tasting, and can be as healthy or decadent as you like. End it with one of the fabulous desert pasties like the peanut butter one!",

    "text": "Our first experience with Cornish pastys. I have to admit we were both dubious enough that we briefly considered going elsewhere when we found out we couldn't customize our orders because the pastys are premade and partially cooked as it takes an hour to cook one from start to finish.   The ambiance was cool with a flavor of Britain - long communal tables, dark wood interior and bars to belly up to. Definitely doesn't feel like you're in Arizona anymore! We had instantly been transported to a pub in England.    The quality of food was extremely high. I won't tell you everything we ordered because we will sound like gluttons, but I will say we took home leftovers from every dish because the the portions are ample.   My husband had the oggie and I had the Mexican. Both were very good but my husband said he would order mine next time. The prices were very reasonable! We were shocked at how low our bill was and how many leftovers we had.   All in all, worth the visit. We look forward to bringing friends and family back to enjoy this unique and flavorful spot!",

    "text": "Place is dark and strangely laid out, with a weird raised and railed off island area, flanked by long bench style banquet booths. Menu seemed to have a large variety, but there are no substitutions and almost every item has cheese on it. Always makes me weary, as cheese is used to hide overly salty food and bland tastes. Had been here many months ago and was underwhelmed,  but was coaxed into giving it another shot by a coworker. I had the salmon pasty, and let me say it was actually very good! Fish came out perfectly cooked, moist and tender. Portion seems to look small but fills you up very fast! I also had the coleslaw because I felt like I wanted something cool to balance. It was very tasty, and homemade, but overpriced for the portion. Overall they managed to redeem themselves. Great place to go drinking with the boys or girls and get some heavy food to offset the beer. A solid 4 stars but to those rating 5 star... I'm just not seeing it, other yelpers. What did I miss? Service was adequate but nothing special. The novelty of a pasty is not worth that extra star.",

    "text": "My aunt was excited to take us here for her birthday. Yup, take us out for HER birthday. She said she want us to try this place because it has authentic British food and if we don't like it, we can go somewhere else... ??? She said theres two location and she always go to the one in Tempe but she yelped and saw that the Mesa location isn't as packed as the one in Tempe.   Upon arrival, I realized I've eaten here once before. Nothing too crazy but not bad either [: I just remembered that their fries are called 'chips' instead.   We were lucky and got seated right away for a party of 8. Of course we ordered the chips, some with garlic and some without and each of us got a different pasty to try. There was just so much options I couldnt pick from, so I asked the waitress which ones were her favorite and I settled for the Salmon one. Eh..  Chips with and without garlic were a bit on the salty side.  Salmon pasty- a bit too fishy  Italian pasty - my favorite! If I would have ordered this, maybe I would like this place more.  Cajun chicken - my second favorite, even got one to go for my mom ;]  Chicken alfredo - I felt like the chicken were a bit on the dry side.  Hamburger pasty - Makes great leftover! Microwaved and eaten with A1 steak sauce !  I don't remember the names of the other ones but my sister got a mexicanish flavor and I didnt even bother to try because I dont really like that flavour.   BUT the thing that made our night was the dessert!!! If you come here, make sure you leave room for some dessert pasty!  Of course we were all full but my aunt gave glowing reviews about the dessert and we decided to try out some. Unfortunately because of the monsoon season in Arizona right now which makes it more humid (is that possible???), there were no strawberry meringes, so we stuck with the apple pasty and the PBJ with banana pasty.  Oh my, the apple was my favorite of the two because of the caramel sauce they filled it with. Heaven in your mouth. The PBJ was not bad either. I just wish they put more banana in it because the bites with the banana were the best. They have actual pieces of peanuts in there also which gave it a nice crunch.   All in all, I dont mind eating here again.",

Altogether we tried the Scottish Egg, Potato soup, Chicken wings, Reuben, Roast Beef, and lamb 'vindaloo' pasties.  With a little room left we tried the banana pie and the toffee cake for dessert.  All was very delicious and nice portions...  Sure enough the manager took the 60% off our bill.  Though we were there two hours it was a pleasant atmosphere.  Giving it a 5 star and we will be back.

The food and drinks are always phenomenal. The same can't really be said about the service. I wouldn't recommend getting take out here. I certainly don't anymore. Only dine-in because at least then the mistakes can be fixed. Thus saving you a trip back when you realize you are missing parts of your order or if you happen to received the wrong pasty. It is about 50-50 from my experience on them getting orders right. While the service is often lacking, the food, atmosphere and good times tend to make up for it.",

The Scottish Eggs with mustard is to die for. It's perfectly cooked and it's the perfect appetizer! I always order my pasty with the exact mustard sauce that comes out with the Scottish eggs. Idk what it is about it but it seriously is so good and goes perfectly. My favorite pasty is the bangers and mash one hands down! And then dipped in that Scottish egg mustard sauce yum!!   The only reason that I wouldn't give them 5 stars is the service. The customer service has been terrible every time that I have been there. The waitresses are not really that friendly and they are not really attentive to their customers. I've gone in on slow days and it would still take over 30 mins to get a refill or over 30 mins to even have the waitress come back. I would understand slower service on busy day. But, it's a consistent pattern that I've noticed at this location no matter what it looks like inside. I've been in restaurants where the waitresses have double the amount of customers each and they are still way more attentive and way more friendly. There's no excuse in my opinion for poor customer service. But, the food is really good so it's worth having to put up with them for a little bit.",

I always thought they served up meat pasties and nothing else...until I checked Happy Cow and noticed they had vegan options!   So...I'm vegan and my significant other is not...in fact he's probably the opposite of vegan if there's such a thing. Anyway, his parents were coming up to visit from Tucson and they're also non-vegans so I needed to find a place that catered to carnivores as well as herbivores like me. Heh. I opened my Happy Cow app, which provides an awesome list of restaurants in your surrounding area that are vegan, vegetarian, or offer vegan/vegetarian options. When I saw Cornish Pasty make the list, I investigated further thinking I would have to customize a pasty in order to make it vegan, thinking it would probably taste like garbage. Nope! Cornish Pasty has no one, not two, but 4 vegan options that they switch up daily!   When we were there, I asked the server what the options were, which he went over in detail. I went with the vegan cubano pasty that was delicious! It had jackfruit, vegan ham, vegan cheese, and pickles. The pickles were actually a nice touch and the flavors all worked together.   Desert-wise...yep, they have a vegan option of that as well! They can make their peanut butter and jelly pasty vegan. I didn't try this but definitely will next time.   So happy this place has vegan options!",

This happened 2 more times too! I went with my 3rd option after all the back and fourth. Kind of crazy so many were out.   I finally got the Greek patsy. It was pretty good for a 3rd option. It had olives and chicken, artichoke and came with tzaztiki sauce. Not bad really.   I would have preferred the Guinness stew!   We like this place a lot but they are pretty pricey for what you actually get.   The pasty's are pretty small.",

    "text": "Old Speckled Hen? Banoffee??!!! No way, Arizona, we might just start a while. We, ordered Scotch Eggs to start, of course, along with the first pint of the day. Great atmosphere, loads of places to sit, couches, darts, pool, a patio, what more could you ask for in a Brit spot? Nice servers, check.  I ordered the Guinness pasty, and hubby chose the basic to start. There are loads of good brews on tap, I think we found our new hangout spot which so far ranks up next to Shakespeare in San Diego and we love that place. But first, or appetizers aka Scotch Eggs: served warmed up, slightly crunchy on the outside, very tasty. They disappeared at an amazing speed, natch. Nice mix of old and new English tunes overhead, good level not super loud and annoying +1. If you enjoy coffee and pumpkin you mist try the pumpkin porter and Kaffee Koelsch, just delicious! Next up was the mash with cheese and garlic. The cheese is slightly crunchy, and the mash with copious garlic is very tasty, guaranteed to keep Dracula away! My Guinness pasty was nothing short of amazing: first taste was the gravy they use which is evocative of Sunday roast dinner. Steak, carrot, onion, potato all blended together bite after bite, each making me happier as I sip my pumpkin porter. As for the hubby's lamb, I will never understand mint jelly but aside from that the lamb was flavorful and tasty. Be warned: the pasties are delicious here but not made with puff pastry. That doesn't take away from the goodness, just be advised. It is time for banoffee! Banana goodness. Pie crust goodness. Oh heaven it's delicious! A+",

    "text": "I have two favorite restaurants in the world, and Cornish Pasty is one of them (Primanti Bros. in Pittsburgh is the other in case you are curious).   There's nothing bad on the menu here.  The pasty options can satisfy any palate and it's probably the best restaurant for vegetarians in town as well.   The soups are amazing, the beer menu is off the charts and you could come here every single day and still be yearning for more.   The service also never disappoints.  Only thing I'd challenge you, gentle reader, is to eat half a pasty and save the rest for later.  They're amazing and delicious and about 25% bigger than what I can eat (not that I haven't eaten a whole one many times), but I find lately I'm super happy with half of one and saving the other half for another meal.",

I've had much better pasty for cheaper. I thought it was really expensive for the size, especially since you don't get any sides. It looked to be about 6 to 8 inches. The serving size was a pound. It was $13 plus tip. It tasted kind of like a sandwich crossed with a calzone. However, the pasty was more like a toasted sandwich in texture. It wasn't that crispy, which was disappointing. Plus, the bottom was soggy from the filling. Also the filling was kind of odd tasting because it sometimes tasted like a chicken sandwich and sometimes it tasted like a pizza or calzone. The main problem was that they wouldn't substitute. I just wanted to take out the cheese.  I have indigestion because of the cheese.",

    "text": "I am definitely coming back here the next time in AZ. We ordered two pasties and shared, which I think is a good idea if you're not sure what you like (aka it's your first time, like me). We came in at 9:30PM ish on a Sunday. It wasn't very crowded so we had a free choice of seating and service was pretty quick.   The Roast Dinner pasty was pretty good. I thought it could use a tad more meat, and a tad more flavor? But I liked the horseradish cream (more so than the red wine sauce) and thought that it went pretty well together (although not a perfect match in flavor maybe).   The other pasty was really tasty (I'm a sucker for bacon so might be biased). We got the Royale with Cheese- which honestly was like a bacon mushroom cheeseburger in a crispy pie shell and it was super glorious and I was very happy. I got it with ranch on the side and it went together well.   Finally, we ordered a Peanut Butter and Jelly pasty with ice cream to go (we wanted to eat it at home). They packaged it up nicely and put the ice cream (two scoops) in a separate container. I had just enough time to digest on the 20min drive back, and that dessert pasty was SO YUMMY. It was perfect with the vanilla ice cream and was warm and delicious and UGH SO GOOD. It had bananas in it also. I like peanut butter and banana so for me this was a plus.   Overall, I liked the ambiance of the place. I liked the music, the servers were nice, and the food was very good. The pasties all run ~$11-13 (for entree, dessert ones are cheaper), so for our meal, dessert, and a beer, the total was just under $40 (before tip). I think it's a great place for a late night bite with a friend.",

If you get a pasty you can't modify what in it. They pre make them and bake it fresh. So it's not quick. And in general the service is not adequate. If you want good service and food fast this is not the place. If you want a unique yummy meal and have time to relax and enjoy the ambiance this is a great spot.   We sat outside because it was beautiful out. Unfortunately no one told us there was an awesome live band performing inside. Another example of how the service lacks. You would think the hostess would want to let us know.  The food was great and we got a few refills even sitting outside. While the service was slow I was grateful the server didn't forget about us.   Overall great experience with great food.",

Opted for this location for my recent visit and am sad I did.   This was also the first time I took kids in, and therein presented the first challenge. We asked to custom-order some things. That is a no-go. Apparently, all their food is pre-made. First off, why do they charge such high prices if they're not even making the food there? I might as well go to the grocery store and buy a potpie. Secondly, ugh to no custom orders. Thirdly, the waitress was really unhelpful when it came to finding solutions we could eat between various dietary restrictions and preferences. This alone made the visit difficult.  Adding to it, the food we got really wasn't good, which is odd because I usually love it. This time, a lot of the steak was really hard, almost like chewing plastic. After a few bites I genuinely could not chew, I ended up pulling all the meat out of mine and just eating the veggies and crust. One person in my party ordered the same thing I did and was not as selective, then wound up sick that night. :/   I would have mentioned the food issues to the waitress, but she never asked. Actually, she was MIA most of the time. My companion ordered a tea and then requested sweetener when it arrived. She didn't return with anything until the appetizers had come ten minutes later. I was in a party of six and we had a fair amount of dishes collect on the table. We didn't even have spaces for our food when it came. I ended up collecting what I could and stacking it at the end of the table, but she never took any of it at all. I don't even know if she checked on us once. I think I waited about ten minutes after we finished before she even came into view again and I had to flag her down to get the check. I waited another ten or so for her to come back with my card.  I cannot see myself returning to this location again. Perhaps not the chain as a whole either.",

The potatoes, steak, and the red wine gravy combination definitely hit the spot! Another dish we sampled was The Chicken Greek. A savory choice! Out of the two, I'd love to eat the Oggie for breakfast and eat the Chicken Greek for lunch. For desert, we had the Shirley Temple pudding. Coming in a hot and small iron clad pot, the chocolate bread pudding was so mouth-watering delicious! We even had to scrape down the sides of the pot to get every last crumb of the pudding. We opted to get the ice cream on the side which was light, fluffy, and easy to spoon on top of the chocolate.   Overall, they've got excellent service. I'd recommend co-workers, classmates, or friends to come here during after hours!",

My two favorites are the Cottage Pie and Lamb Vindaloo (two completely different but equally delicious choices). They are super filling so take your second half home and enjoy one of their delicious desserts. I recommend the strawberries pavlova or the chocolate bread and butter pudding.

Our visitors are asking if this is normal service for this restaurant and we are squirming. Finally our main meal arrived, another drink order was so slow we were finished eating when the drinks arrived and the waitress kindly offered the drinks for free.

The atmosphere however was distressing.  It was so dark that we had to use a flash light to read the menus. Luckily one of the men in our group had a small flash light in his pocket.  (He has dined here before.)  It was very noisy with loud music and talking so that we could barely carry on a conversation.  Is there ever a quieter time here?

Pie) Cornish Pasty is not a place a would come to if I was rushed for time at all as the food takes a while to prepare. Even though we may have to wait a bit longer for food than at other restaurants, every server I've had here has been attentive and friendly and eager to answer questions or make recommendations. I've sat at the bar and I've sat at the tables. The restaurant is always clean, I never stick to the floor or table, the food is good and freshly made, the servers have always been accomodating and the music is fun (and a rather ecclectic mix at that). It's a place I will come to again and again and always look forward to introducing friends and family to it. My parents love it and have been back twice since I brought them here a month ago.",

I liked the food \"OK\" but these pastys are not made fresh while you wait - so no substitutions of ingredients are allowed.  Also, you don't get one or two sides included with your pasty, so you will end up spending a good deal of money if you want to sample some of the excellent side dishes.  The mushroom and walnut soup was excellent, as was the fresh bread.",

Once you find the fillings you want you'll get a great, hot pie that's uses high quality ingredients. They also offer a nice variety of sides, my favorite being the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. The dinner salads are also a perfectly good choice for a dinner meal of your not feeling like a pasty. Sitting inside provided for an intimate atmosphere, but may be a little too dark for some, well maybe just me. You'll have to try it at least once if you've never been. All locations provide a similar atmosphere with the same great quality pasties.",

They give the option of leaving half of it uncooked so you could heat the other half later and enjoy a fresh pasty later on, although I opted to devour the entire pasty at once.   While the pasty was delicious, I found their bread pudding's brandy sauce to be far too overwhelming. The dessert ended up tasting more like an alcohol sponge with select unsaturated spots than it did like actual bread pudding.",

I'm here for the concept.  The flaky, firm dough that houses the chosen filling is the star of the show.  Second billing is the pub ambience, from the large wooden tables to the metal plates.  Third is the large beer list.  All of the above comes for a great value.  $6.50 cent glasses of wine.  $3 Guinness on Wednesdays.

Never once have I been disappointed in the food and I can honestly say I've tasted 3/4 of the pasties on the menu.   Do I have an addiction? I think it's safe (and probably best) to say \"yes\".   Their new appetizers that were just released this summer all sound quite delicious, however, I have only tried the Jalepeno Cheese Dip with Pastry Curls and I was impressed.   Usually have awesome service here. Of course, considering the fact that my boyfriend, my roommates, and I were here at least once every couple of weeks, we were bound to have one bad experience as far as service goes.   I will not hold that against you, my beloved Cornish Pasty Co. All of the wonderful experiences make up for that one not so great one.",

I got the Philly Steak pasty and savored the flavors of the meat and man, that pasty crust was dang good too!! Yummy!

Started off great just walking through the door. The decor is killer. They have done some neat things with the bar (tiling, industrial purse hooks - the Mrs. loves those so they stood out to me). The church pews for seating and the glassed over doors for tables are super cool. The melted candle bottles on the table and the black & white photos also help to give it a nice vibe.  Next looked at the menu and they have a great beer selection (mix of on tap & bottles). I did get a bit overwhelmed with the number of pasty choices (which is good). They also have quite a large number of vegetarian pasties which is nice - for the rest of the family. : )  Whittled it down to the chicken tikka, shepherd's pie and royale with cheese. The server recommended the chicken tikka and I went with that. The pasty itself was excellent. Great flavor, little bit of heat, great pastry. As the Mrs. is from Australia, we're big into pastry and things like pasties, meat pies, sausage rolls, etc. I definitely need to get her here soon!  The service was great as well. Everybody was super nice and quite efficient. Food and drink came quickly.   All in all, a great experience. Quite happy with the entire meal.  With so many pasty choices, I think it's trouble once you break the seal. I foresee many, many visits in our future.",

Being used the to hot, crowded, loud Tempe location, hubski and I showed up in our jeans and ratty we-were-thinking-about-going-to-bed-but-decided-to-go-Cornish-style-instead shirts.  In this location, the owners had a little- ok a lot- more space to be creative. The seats are church pews. There are candles in wine bottles. I won't ruin everything for you, but just look closely at the tables.  Although the space is larger, the decor helps to maintain the cozy comfortable quality we love about Cornish-Tempe.  I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken- veggie style. Hubski got the veggie tikka masala. They were both delicious, as always. We went back with a friend a couple of nights later and ordered the caramel apple pasty and the banoffee pie. They were out of bananas so they substituted strawberries. It was tasty, but bananas really belong to that confection. The apple caramel pasty was PMS-licious!  We love this place and we'll be back soon... maybe tonight!

Backstory - when I was a teenager and would hang out weekends in Harvard Square my favorite place to eat was Warburtons - anyone remember it? It all connected with the Susan Howatch novels (Penmarric) I was reading at the time - anyway I digress. Suffice it to say that the whole pasty concept was intriguing and this place was terrific. It closed down years ago but I kept hoping I'd find something similar ... someday.  To present day, newly come to the area. We finally made it to the Mesa location. I was glad there wasn't a wait, but walking in was a strange experience. It was dark, loud with no one at the entrance to seat us. Figured it wasn't that kind of place. The decor was a definite turnoff for me - cold, weird seating that felt like a black and white railroad car. I hate to be nit-picky but the first thing I saw when I sat down was a spider going up the wall next to me.  Ok, enough on atmosphere. The food ... huge menu that's a lot of fun to look at with lots of choices. I had the Greek salad and Greek chicken pasty. The salad was great - enough for 2. MH had the Mexican, which was actually quite spicy, and he's very used to spice. Overall our opinion on the pasties was ... ok. Quite filling - we only had half each. However, we thought they'd be a bit bigger to justify the cost, or a dollar or two cheaper since they don't come with anything else.  The dough was sturdy, well formed for holding the fillings but it was definitely hard.  Re: the service - it was good - she was friendly ... but it was hard to find anyone when we wanted anything, especially when we wanted to pay and leave.  I hesitated writing this since everyone seems to love it so much, but this was my experience ... not bad, but not somewhere I want to spend my precious restaurant dollars for a so-so experience. The atmosphere was kind of off-putting. Given everything, I don't think we'll be back. And I had such hopes! Sorry Cornish Pasty!",

I'm surprised its taken me this long to try this place because the hype is insane!  As i've said before about places that are super hyped....believe the hype on this one! this is one of those places where the menu makes it tough to decide on one thing.    Based on previous reviews and a trusted opinion from a fellow yelper (Robert J.) that joined me for dinner, i decided to try the Royale with Cheese.  Bomb-delicious!.  Robert J. decided to try something new and he had the Rosemary Steak.  Since the pasties are cut in half by default, the decision go half-sies was easy.  Rosemary Steak was also Bomb-delicious.  I wish i could give a deeper description of each but it would really be tough.  You just have to try it yourself.  As a side we split the oven chips which are pretty much steak fries seasoned with salt and pepper (nothing to be crazy about but decent).  This place also seems like a cool place to chill and have an adult beverage.  They carry a nice variety of draft beers from across the world and i must say, a beer with the pasty is a solid combo.  Until next time...",

They are good because:  a.) wide beer selection and they serve copious amounts if you so choose; b.) they have pasties AND good salads which is a rare find in Mesa; c.) they place just as copious amounts of Iron Maiden and have a free jukebox for that matter; and d.) consistent, friendly wait staff.    Any given night you will see an odd combination of young and aged East Valley hipsters; parental types and the working happy hour crowd.  They all get along and there is always a fair amount of seating available.  At night they light candles which gives some unique ambiance that can't really be found in Az.",

I was curious and headed in. We really weren't sure what to expect but since I've spent some time in the UK, I was intrigued.  The atmosphere is very cool. Industrial type metal tables, with candles burning on the tables and long wooden church pews for people to share tables.  The waitresses (we've been back since) are really cool and completely unique from each other.   My kid had a PB&J pasty, and I ordered the Cajun Chicken. I loved mine, and hers was so big she couldn't finish it. The next time I got the Rosemary Chicken, which I love almost as much as they Cajun. I am a picky eater but both of these were awesome.   They do take a little time to cook your food, which means it's fresh. And if you call ahead you can special order (like no onions or whatever). They also deliver within a few miles of their location (including my house and MCC where I work!).   I hear the desserts rock, too!  I will keep going back.",

I went with the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA, which went great with the pasty.  Another good sign to me was that few of the customers looked anything alike. An older couple, a few Harley riders, some guys in suits, a few punk-looking gents... all there for the good grub. Looking forward to a return trip.",

To be honest, I was a little reserved about dining somewhere that only served one type of food, however, you have to think that if a place serves one thing, they should be able to do it well, right? Well, The Cornish Pasty Company does it well.  The pastys were light and flaky, the fillings abundant and tasty. The food, as simple as it was, was done well and I'd definitely do it again. The atmosphere definitely chimes in to the british pub feel and the church pews totally add to the ambiance of the restaurant as a whole.  My only issue was that the prices did seem just a tad high for what you receive. The pastys do not come with any kind of side dish aside from a dipping sauce that's paired with each individual offering. With each pasty averaging about $9-10, it's a bit much.",

They've added a pool table and darts(both free) for entertainment and some casual eating and talking areas, which I think is  great for a bar. In terms of food, I can't say enough good things about this place. I've had everything on the menu except the vindaloo and veggie pasty, and that's because I can never bring myself to try something new when there are so many rock solid winners on the menu. I recommend in order of most favorite to still pretty damn awesome; The Ruben, the breakfast pasty, and then the royal with cheese, but like I said there are soo many others that are good. If you order the soup, you get copious amounts of delicious white bread which is good, but not so much if you're watching your figure. The salads are on point, with great dressing choices. My personal favorite is the Greek salad. The plowmans plate is a great appetizer to split for a table or it could be it's own meal and for you cheese lovers out there it's a solid pick. Beer and drink selection is pretty good as well. I'm not much of adventurous beer drinker but their light beers and lager selection has always been really good and varied.",

    "text": "Went there with my husband last night to celebrate our 15th anniversary.  Had been once or twice and sat at bar.  Had good experiences and enjoyed the variety of vegetarian options.  Food was good last night, but our waitress needed some serious help. The ordering went well enough, but while we were eating our delicious pasties the waitress started bussing the table behind us.  She knocked over what I think was a pretty good amount of red wine in a glass on the table and then left quickly. My husband's back was to the table and he had felt a splash on his arm. I went and looked behind his chair, saw the spill, and saw a huge splatter of wine across the back of his creme colored shirt.  Wine was also a platter ed on the floor.   The best I could tell is that our waitress either had very dull eyesight or was hoping we wouldn't notice.  Another employee walked by and saw what happened and I told her it was our waitress.  Waitress came back about 5 minutes later and offered to \"blot\" the wine out w/water......really..like that would work.  She then asked us if we wanted anything else, dessert, if my husband wanted another beer.  She ended up taking off $14.  Said she bought us a round, but $14 didn't even cover our 2 beers much less the cost of my husband's ruined shirt.   Pretty much ruined our anniversary dinner and she didn't give a True apology.  After reading other reviews it seems like service is an issue at this location.  If we ever go back, I would most likely sit at the bar or counter to hopefully avoid inconsiderate waitresses spilling food or drink.",

While it's definitely hipster-tastic, the food and the atmosphere are a welcome change from my childhood memories about dining in Arizona.  I've never had a pasty before, and I'm not even sure this is authentic if that's your merit of restaurant judgment.  But I can say that most of the food here didn't disappoint and I went back there a couple of times during my stay.  Both the Royal and the Shepard's Pie pasties were delicious.  The crust was solid but still flakey.  Not overcooked or tasteless.  The sides (curried potatoes and cauliflower casserole thingie) we tried were alright but I wouldn't order them again.  The beer selection is pretty varied and reasonably priced with a good happy hour.  Atmosphere was comfortable.  Patio was well appointed with fans and a corner of smoking hipsters.",

I've worked at restaurants before and the smell replicate that of a DIRTY kitchen. Like the floors, rubber mats or the mops haven't been cleaned. The smell of sewage reaps over the entire restaurant. Instead of savoring the pasty aroma as it was being brought out to us from the oven, my friend and I couldn't get over the nasty smell of funk!   The bathroom was also DISGUSTING! I remember being a busboy at a family owned restaurant in Mesa and the staff would always have bathroom duties every hour or so, checking on the bathroom and do general whip-downs and toilet cleaning. It's really a managerial duty to assign tasks like these to the staff.  Moving on to the pasty... well, it was pretty darn good! My friend had the Oogie and I ordered the Greek Chicken. I like the Oogie more... the sauce that accompanied it was delicious, it seemed like it was roux-based; but the second time we went there they gave us a totally different sauce with our Oogie. They had some other sauce with it that tasted like berries. We asked out server if they had another sauce similar to our first visit. We tried explaining what the sauce was like, in terms or color, texture, and goodness, but she came out with a comparable - H.D. (?) sauce. It was ok - not the same though. I was a little disappointed...   Loved the flaky crust, btw.  I really like their food, but aside from the smell it was good! I'll try the Tempe location next time, maybe it'll be less stinky.",

As you walk in, they've got these super long booths that invite and encourage big groups, tall ornamental candles with long trails of wax that occasional reach down to the table, and just the right dimness to evoke an intimate atmosphere without necessitating a flashlight to read the menu.   The pasties are all incredible. My one regret about this place is that I wish I could try every single one, but there are something like 30 to choose from, and it alway stakes me an inordinate amount of time to choose. They have thoroughly mastered the art of incorporating just about any cuisine into that delectable pasty crust. You like straight up Irish style? They got it. You want steak? They have that. Are you a fan of Indian food?! Yes, they have one of those. How about a cheeseburger pasty? YES. Each variation is so tempting, I've actually found myself considering their vegetarian options, and I'm about as vehemently anti-vegetarian as they come. So, yeah, the food's good.  Beer-wise, I love this place. Love. It. First, you get to pick what size beer you want (16, 20, or 32 oz, or pint, imperial pint, and stein). Then, pick from their draft selection. Yes, it's not a very wide selection, but look what you're getting: Boddington's, Guinness, Rogue Hazelnut Brown, DOGFISH HEAD 90 MINUTE(!!!). You simply cannot leave here unsatisfied. And if that wasn't enough, during happy hour Irish Car Bombs are only $3. I believe a better deal simply doesn't exist in Tempe. Do yourself a favor and eat here as soon as possible.",

    "text": "I'm so torn! We LOVE the food here and have tried many different things on the menu. I have Cornish mining ancestors, so pasties have a special place in my heart.   However, the service is never great. It's usually okay, so we just deal with it, but our last trip was awful. Our waiter was extremely inattentive. He never refilled our drinks, could never be found, and our food took over an hour to arrive. Two out of three pasties were only delivered when we flagged down a random waitress to help us out. Then it took another 5-10 minutes for another random waiter to bring our third pasty. Then, of course, we sat around for literally 15 minutes with empty plates in front of us, waiting to pay.   I wish this place would improve its service. The food is easily five stars, but the overall experience can be a disappointment.",

    "text": "Pasty (pronounced pass-tee)= Super fancy hot pocket. Where is Jim Gaffigan to scarf these down next to me? We came in with hopeful eyes and hungry stomachs and weren't disappointed. At 5 PM on a Friday, the lot was crazy full but restaurant wasn't too bad. We were seated immediately at a ginormous glass encased door and church pew table. I felt like I needed to genuflect and do the sign of the cross. Unique, though, as was the hodge podge lighting in the gaming area and the heavy tin menus. Service was friendly, helpful and prompt with the exception of water refills.   There are so many dang choices that it was hard to narrow down. I despise onions, which most of the pasties seemed to have. The server said that there is no way to omit items unless you call 24 hours in advance and make a request, as they pre-make the pasties each day. Makes sense! With so many options, I tried to talk hubby into splitting two kinds, since they cut the generous sized pasties in half. No dice. There are two kinds of food people...those who feel food envy if they don't share(me) and those who will bite your hand if you even glance at their plate (husband). As long as I have enough fingers to pick up a fork, it is worth the risk at a place like this with so many options!   We ordered draft beers with happy hour special, oven fries, carne adovada pasty and a spicy BBQ chicken pasty. Hubby wanted the pilgrim, but they were out for the day. He then thought about the royale (like a Big Mac pasty), but the server told him it was not as good as the BBQ one he was considering. The carne adovada meat was so dang tender. I wish that the cheese had more of a presence, if it was even on there? Both pasties had a SW flare and the BBQ was perfectly spicy and shredded chicken tender. We both liked but not loved our choices. We both liked the dough the best.   The oven fries were \"meh,\" with an over abundance of burnt crisps. I appreciate that they cut these in-house but they were rubbery and burnt and made us wish we had tried the mashed potatoes or the broccoli bake. I would say we would try those next time, but we aren't in a huge rush to come back. The pasties were a unique concept and the ambiance cool which bumps up a star more than we typically would give this place.",

    "text": "My husband and I love this place. Seriously. We go here several times a month. BUT, we went in tonight (a Thursday), and they were relatively steady...normal business for a Thurs. We sat at the bar, where we always do, and had a bartender that we have had many, many times before. I sat down while my husband went to the bathroom, and was there for several minutes before anyone greeted me (the bar wasn't full). Two more people came and sat next to me and they were immediately greeted and presented with drinks and menus.  I found this to be incredibly off-putting, regardless of how much of a regular we are. Still waiting on a greeting, my husband came back and sat down. The bartender (female, 1 of 2) approached me and very curtly asked IF I wanted a drink. ?? Yes?? It took several more minutes to get the drinks, and even longer to get menus. Once the menus were there, it was like someone pushed fast forward. At this point, both bartenders were asking us for our orders about every 2 minutes. My husband finally asked, politely, to give us some time, we were in no hurry and enjoying our drinks. This continued anyway, so finally we hastily decided on dinner. The female bartender continued to be short with us, did not smile one time, and never actually came to where we were sitting to speak to us. She was constantly doing something else, yelling across the bar. She tried several times to remove our plates while we were still eating. It seemed like the 2nd bartender (male) was a trainee. I kept telling my husband that she was making me uncomfortable because she was rushing us (she asked us 3-4 times in a span of 5 minutes if we were ready for our bill, or if we were going to have another drink). Additionally, she asked us, \"2 checks?\"  This is ironic because we came to this location after our wedding for dinner just months ago. We have also been here hundreds of times and never asked for split checks (we are not hard to forget, I have bright red hair and my husband has an impressive beard). We ended up paying in cash and decided to leave without finishing. As we were leaving, my husband offered her some constructive criticism. She was extremely defensive and blamed everything on the 2nd bartender, with whom we had very little contact. She offered no apology or acknowledgement of her behavior, she just said \"Okay\" and walked away. We told her we would be back, but basically that we expect better service than this (honestly, this was the worst I have ever been treated by a server). I was so disappointed, uncomfortable, and put off. I worked in the restaurant industry for over ten years. I understand having bad days, being busy, in the weeds, wanting to leave before 2 AM. But it is dangerous to treat a customer as such when they spend quite a bit of time and money at your restaurant. Other customers can see that, too. I sincerely hope we don't experience this again, because we really do love CP!",

But it's the food that keeps me coming back. If you have never had a Pasty, this is the place to go. I've never taken anyone there and they not be amazed. Give the hibiscus tea a try also.

My boyfriend had the Pilgrim while I enjoyed the Lovely Bit a Salmon. It was decadent and filling - the perfect meal for a late dinner. The soft crunch of their made to order Signature Pastys is a necessity that can easily become addicting - don't short yourself with ordering anything else on the menu before you try one! Nothing as signature or authentic as a meal here.

We take food out 99% of the time and it's always a hit or miss. Sometimes the bananas are black, sometimes they are soggy, sometimes the crust is thin as paper, sometimes there is so much crust you feel you are eating sand, sometimes the caramel sauce is invisible and sometimes there is so little there that you just want to cry. I crave their Banoffi on a daily basis but absolutely hate when I drive 30 min for it and when I get home is a disappointment. PLEASEEEEE I mean PLEASE get your portions down on your banoffis!",

I was happy to find that this place existed on a weekend trip to Phoenix and because of that, I snapped up the opportunity to go there. As you walk in, I get a vibe of an English country pub as the lighting is dim and the place was kickin'.  The Food  I would have been disappointed if I didn't try their Cornish pasty. There are a few types of Cornish pasty that we would call 'traditional' but two in particular include steak or beef mince. This was the beef mince variety and it was overall - very good. We don't tend to eat pasties in a restaurant setting as they're more of a passing lunch or snack but I can understand why they're making a big deal out of these. The only questionable thing was the gravy on the side, why? Because the pasties are generally filled with the gravy and because of the lack of gravy on the inside (without it) it could have potentially been dry. I'm just happy it was included.  Thank you for bringing common English fare to Phoenix.",

    "text": "I have wanted to visit this place for years! My family has always made pasties and I was very excited to try someone else's.  We went in early in the evening on the weekend. It was not busy at all and we were able to seat ourselves. There is a lot of seating but because it is mostly large tables, it makes it weird to choose a place to sit with a kid and not block the walkway with a highchair.  We were able to order right away since it was slow. Our waitress was sitting at the bar eating while not helping us. Our drinks ran low and a different server noticed after a while and filled them. My biggest complaint was how long it takes to get food. We were there when it was slow, I cannot imagine how long you have to wait when it is busy. The food was delicious and I wish you could personalize it but we were told it was all premade so you can't. I also loved how many choices there were for vegetarians. It is about half the menu so that is awesome!!! I would definitely return again.",

There was nothing that seemed homemade about it other than someone put scoops of cheap drink mix together.  Then came the pasties.  The menu is so much infusion now, they've mostly gotten away from what a real pastie is. I mean Mexican? Spicy Asiago chicken? Pesto chicken? Tikka masala? Meatball? We opted for the shepherd pie pasties. They arrived with rock hard crusts and inside was cold cheese and overbearing mint. My husband's even had cold mashed potato and the meat was cool. He wouldn't eat it. The red wine gravy was not bad tasting but congealed - like it was sitting around.  Whatever is going on there now is not good. Unfortunately, we were given a gift certificate to go. We have a remaining balance that will not be used.",

Roast beef, ham, cheese, all delicious. I ordered it with a scotch egg for $4.50 more. Wasn't fresh tasting. Fresh sliced apple and grapes, and a dollop of Branston pickle relish, very nice. Wife enjoyed her pilgrim pasty. I had the standard Oggie. Very little meat, potatoes were not cooked through, and it wasn't hot! Gravy was a congealed glop. Waitress server was vaguely uninterested in being of much use to us old folks, but a nice young man filled the gaps. Overall, disappointed. We expected the usual quality we've had here before, and didn't get it.",

Middle areas for eating. Just a fun place. Outside patio pretty cool. Decorated with a cool vibe.   Waitress friendly and being first time took time to go over how they're made and ones to try. Great house bread.   Try it, you'll like it.",

    "text": "Excellent food and service! Huge menu with something for everyone and lots of variety to keep to coming back to try more things. I went 2x in the week I was visiting AZ! It was that good!  We went on a Saturday night and it was only a 20 minute wait for a table of 6. We got a big booth and brought our big appetites after a day of hiking and there was plenty of delicious food and even leftovers.  The pasties are a lot of food per plate. I ate 1/2 of mine with some to share/ sore and had a 1/2 piece that I took home and ate for dinner 1 night. I tried the Shepard's pie with minced lamb and the flavors and portion and portion of fillings were spot on. Bread was hot and crusty and buttery. It has a nice thick slice of cheddar cheese inside that oozed out like cheese porn.   The only drawbacks besides waiting for a table were that they tend to run out of items daily. We ordered the scotch egg (sold out the first time, but available the second time and delicious!) and I wanted the Royale with cheese but it was also sold out. My parents went a 3rd time and a few things were sold out by then. The menu is huge so it's easy to figure out a plan B, but I recommend deciding that as you figure out what you want to order.   The other drawback was that we order a chicken salad and it took so long to come out that we're we're all done with dinner by the time it arrived. We all shared food with my dad who was the unlucky one who wanted that for dinner and it was more than enough food to go around. The server was apologetic and not only comped it to go but comped 2 desserts as well, which shows great customer service and that they care about the people who go there to have a good experience.   It was one of the best meals I had in chandler- twice! Had a pasty the first time and returned for a salad and Cornish egg for lunch and loved it all. Even had enough leftovers from the salad to eat it 3x! When I got my to go box there was an empty container for my leftover dressing which shows a high level of professional customer service.   Thrilled to have found this place and my whole family will be back on each visit to AZ!",

Whatever flavor you are feeling like, they probably have a pasty for it. Shepherds pie, Cajun chicken, Cubano, tikka masala, Guinness stew...so many options! They even had dessert flavors. The meatball appetizer we ordered was also delicious - they came with onions and covered in bacon.   There was a wait to sit inside, but we were quickly seated at a community table on the patio. The heat lamps kept us warm in the chilly evening. The waitress was also fantastic and super friendly!",

It sort of reminds me of a dungeon walking in.  I get the monastery vibe.  Cool.  With long benches for seating... are those church pews?  I don't know.  Candle wax covered Jameson bottles to decorate the tables.  Alright.     The Pilgrim is everything.  Literally thanksgiving leftovers wrapped up in a flakey crust.  It comes with this side of cranberry and red wine gravy that I can't get enough of.  Slather me in Thanksgiving greatness.  The tandoori wings are SO GOOD.    I can never finish an entire pasty so it's like two meals for 12 bucks.  Not bad.  They also have some amazing beers on draft which I'm a fan of.",

Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you order the bread and butter alone, it's only $2. If you order soup, you get a slice of bread with the soup. The chicken and black bean soup that they have is amazing! It's like s southwest style kind of soup. It's so good!   They're known here for their pasties. The way I can describe them is, if a hot pocket fit together with a pot pie, this is what they'd make. A pasty.   I got the rosemary chicken! It had Brie, chicken, potatoes, roast red peppers. The pasty was flaky and buttery on the outside and I loved all the flavors that meshed together. I didn't like the sauce tho, it was a creamy mustard one. That's not my style but the pasty was still good.   I'd come back.",

    "text": "TL;DR: Pretty much everything on the menu is good, and you can't go wrong with trying this place out!  Cornish Pasty holds a lot of great memories, friendship anniversaries, and even thoughtful discussion. What is a pasty, you may ask? Well, my friend, I am glad you asked. It's pretty much a folded pastry stuffed with seasoned goodness.   Let's start with soups. The Cream of Leek and Potato soup has been a favorite ever since I got it on a cold winter day and all I wanted was something to warm my stomach. Thus, Cream of Leek and Potato soup. All soups come with their homemade bread, mmm. It's always so soft, light, and yummy, I could just stuff my face with it and never feel weary from it.   Appetizers. I've only had their Ploughman's Plate, which is a balanced blend of fun cheeses, thinly sliced meats, fruits and veggies. The perfect sharing plate for a large group who want to try a little bit of everything.   Salads. Honestly, every salad is pretty great. The Greek has the olives and feta, pasta salad with the artichokes. Take the lemon-pesto dressing for a refreshing flavor, or the red pepper dressing for a sauce with a slight kick in it.   And of course, their signature pasties. Their pasties are stuffed and filled with goodness, and their extensive list of vegetarian and vegan pasties mean there's something for everyone! I recommend their tradition pasty, shepherd's pie, lamb and mint, chicken greek, and the pilgrim - which is basically Thanksgiving in a pasty.   My next goal is to make it to desserts! I am always way too full to get any dessert, but maybe next time!",

    "text": "I hate to use the term \"hipster\" but that is all I can think about when referring to Cornish Pasty.  The ambiance is one of a kind.  My all time favorite.  I feel like a completely different person when I'm sitting in side.  It has somewhat of a publike feel, with long wooden benches as seating inside - great way to meet strangers, a long bar area, and a huge patio section.  I'd have to say, if you're trying this place out for the first time, go for dinner! The ambiance is quite different and has a dark mysterious factor that I really enjoy.  There aren't really any lights other than the kitchen.  To add to the mysterious effect, each table is lit with a long white candle placed on an old empty wine shaped bottle.  The restaurant comes with a full bar, as well a huge specialty beer menu.  They even have decently priced Irish car bombs.  The service is amazing, as all the staff is very friendly and down to earth.  But don't expect fast service- the food there is made to order, which is a great time to explore and cultivate yourself with a new flavor of beer.   If you're a Pasty virgin, it's like a really fancy hot pocket.  Someone first described to to me like a calzone, which I think lessened my first experience, because I had completely different expectations.  However, it didn't fully ruin my experience because I still loved it.   Cornish Pasty has a HUGE menu selection for pasties.! With over 40 different styles, there isn't something that won't strike your fancy.  They have their Signature, Premium, and Vegetarian Pasties.  You're bound to struggle trying to decide what best suits you at that moment.  It's been a while since my first couple of visits to Cornish Pasty so I don't remember what I tried.  But the last time around I ordered the Peppered Steak; Sirloin steak, sauteed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini, and Stilton cheese- with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce. I have to say, their sauces are to die for.  Nothing I can compare it to.  I've read a lot about their desserts, but I have yet to try it. Every time I venture out to this spot, I'm full by the time I'm done with half my pasty. But I'm determined to try their Apple Caramel Pasty next time.  I hear it's all the rage.",

    "text": "I wish I could give them a better rating because I love anything cooked in pastry.   Overall, the menu is pretty interesting- something for everyone, whether you are a meat and potato or veggie type. There's something there for you. Problem is...they cannot make even the smallest changes because everything is pre-made- as in, already the pastry and frozen delivered to the restaurant, then heated up as people order. At least that's what they told me when I asked for no onions.   We had the Pilgrim and Shepherd's Pie for the main course- they were ok. Fun to eat but nothing taste-wise that blew me away. The pastry was not great either- kinda hard and lumpy.   We also had the PB&J for our son and peanut butter just didn't work- it was chalky and kinda ended up stuck on the pastry and very dry. The jelly was some raspberry with the seeds and that just made eating the thing very awkward.   The restaurant itself could also use a bit of polish- drapes were coated in dust (maybe a nod to some medieval castle inspiration), menu's were sticky, but the bench seating and shared tables were fun.   I'd go back because I'm hopeful that a different order might be better.",

We sat on the outside patio, not the most comfortable seats more like fancy park benches but it was nice out and we had the little one so it worked. First we started out with their \"chips\", English for french fries. We had them with the roasted garlic and they were bomb!  I had the pepper corn steak pasty. The sauce that was served with it was out of this world and all I wanted to do was dip my fries in it till the end of time! The flavors of the pasty worked well together, definitely need to be a big fan of blue cheese to enjoy it though for it provides a strong flavor. The crust was perfectly cooked and flaky and I can see how it would serve any flavor combination well. My boyfriend had the bangers and mash and I may have even liked his more than mine! The gravy served with his was equally as delicious.  The vibe of the restaurant was also super chill and laid back, definitely hipsters floating around but hey, they're people too. I will definitely be back to try them all!!! I think the hamburger one may be next on my list...",

Venue: I think they hit the mark with the church benches and the door tables. Its usually pretty busy on the weekends and can be hard to get somewhere to sit. They are expanding this location which is pretty rad news. The candelabra is pretty good at setting the random tone. They music is usually the hipster genre but thats ok for me.   Appetizer: This is by far the best Mushroom Soup I have yet to find in America. Very similar to the mushroom soup you would find in most pubs in souther England. If they could add the fried bread under, it would perfect.  Food: Tried pretty much all the meat pasties. Can't go wrong with the Oggie or a shepherds pie.   Dessert: Best bonofy pie in town.

    "text": "With the plethora of various Asian, Mexican, and other Central American cultural food places that scatter the valley, Cornish Pasty Co. was a much needed deviation from the typical outing. Until eating here I had never actually tried \"authentic\" British food, but I'm sure glad I did!  Both the atmosphere and the taste made eating here amazing.   Perhaps it's because I am a part of the younger generation, but I am frequently drawn to restaurants that have a simple, modern aesthetic. The softly lit and rustic feel of Cornish Pasty co. fulfilled this desire to the brim. Not only did the atmosphere make it enjoyable (a wonderfully mellow alternative rock playlist wavered overhead), but the kindness and charisma of the servers helped as well. They weren't afraid to chat you up as you ordered, but knew to not overstep their boundaries.   Finally, there is the food (mmmm yes. The FOOD.) As I mentioned, I had not indulged in what might be called culturally British food before. Because of this I played it safe and ordered the chipotle chicken pasty, whose name rang familiar with my southern grown tastebuds. What followed was a tasty adventure. The portions are well suited for the type of food, and I finished just as I started feeling full. The pasty itself was delicious, a great combination of meat that reminded me of the lovechild of a calzone and a spanakopita. But what sealed the deal was the sauce. Each pasty comes with a flavor specific sauce to accompany it and it was not something I felt I could do without.   So here's a recap: Tasty, good atmosphere, friendly servers, delicious sauce. 5 Stars.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying a pasty and I am glad that I first had them here, based on the recommendation of a friend who favors this place.   This place was jam-packed on a Monday evening! Their pasty menu is really extensive!! We were having a hard time trying to make a selection from among the wide range of premium & signature pasties. We finally decided to settle on the Lamb Vindaloo Pasty(for the Indian flavour) and the Chicken Pot Pie Pasty.   For appetizers, we had the tandoori chicken wings - these were super oily, so much so that the waitress even gave us extra napkins to wipe off the excess oil.. eww! But I would give this appetizer a slight plus point for the spicy masalas coating the wings, that made it tasty. I just wish they had done a better job of marinating the chicken wings in the proper fashion before cooking them the right way(which's baking & grilling them and not deep frying!!)  The accompanying yoghurt mint sauce was what really caught our attention more than the chicken wings itself. Its super duper delicious!! The waitress who served us was very helpful in explaining the different sauces served here and she even brought us different samplers to try out during the main course.  The lamb vindaloo pasty was awesome, True to it's taste. If you are a lamb fan, you should definitely give this pasty a try. The chicken pot pie pasty was passable with a mixed blend of potatoes, vegetables and chopped chicken. It went well with the yoghurt-mint sauce and the tahini sauce.  Finally, it was desert time and once again we were at a loss to pick one among the various tempting choices on the list. The waitress once again poured in with her help, describing the best and the okayish desserts. If you are a toffee fan, the Sticky Toffee Pudding is the most delicious on the list.  They had also run out of the Chocolate bread & butter pudding that day since everyone seemed to be ordering it.   We finally decided to give the Banoffie Pie a try. Beware!, the dessert is too much for just two people. We were full by the time we finished off half of the pie. The pie's crust was difficult to break and had a hidden layer of caramel cream within, which complimented well with the whipped cream. Aah, the whipped cream.. is well, not the lighter version, but a heavy thick cream that tastes almost like homemade butter. You can only have so much of that heavy cream. I wouldn't have it again.  I would give this place 4 stars for the food, 3.5 stars for the service. 3 stars for the ambience(they had good candle lighting all over, but if you prefer someplace quiet, then you should skip this place).",

We love the food, but we cannot justify coming to this location even though we live within walking distance.  In the 8 times we've been here we've never been pleased. The first time we came there was a hair in our pasty. They were unapologetic and didn't even offer to comp the meal. They expected us to pay for it when they brought the bill to us. I had to ASK for the pasty with the hair in it to be removed.  Another time we came with a group of about 10. We called ahead and were seated outside. It took us over 30 min to get a waitress out to take our drink orders, an hour to get our food, and then ANOTHER hour to get our bills. A lot of us had children and it made for a frustrating even. Again, they were completely unapologetic and made us feel like we were a hassle for the wait staff.  After so many poor experiences, we resorted to doing take out since we can literally see the building from our backyard (we live that close). We've had them lose our order twice. We've gone to pick it up and they didn't even have record we called in. Still frustrating, but the food is so good we thought we'd give it a shot.  My wife is now pregnant and had a craving for the Cajun pasty (so delicious), so I tried calling  in to place an order so I could pick it up on the way home. I called and the phone was busy, no problem. I tried back 5 minutes later, still busy. Okay, I understand, it's busy sometimes. I called about 5 minutes later and the phone rang... and rang... and rang. I waited with the phone ringing for ANOTHER 5 minutes. No answer. I hung up and called back, and they let it ring again. Luckily, I work kind of close to the location in Tempe. I called them, they answered on the first ring, took my order, and were a delight when I went to pick it up.  If you want to enjoy your food make it a point to go to the location in Tempe, or really any location OTHER than the one here in Mesa.  We've even complained to the management at this location and they don't care whatsoever. Don't bother with this place. Go to Tempe and get a Cajun and a Banoffee for dessert.",

The pilgrim is like thanksgiving came early the red pepper black bean, chicken and jalapeno soup was so good I got some to go for the next day. The British chips (fries) were so good especially in the red wine gravy that comes with the pasty! Highly recommend",

Pros: -Great/friendly staff -Lots of good options to explore on the menu (including vegetarian options) -Nice variety of beers and decent  happy hour specials -Fun/down-to-earth feel  Cons: -You essentially seat yourself, which can get tricky if you're going with a large group. The staff is usually accommodating, though, and will try to find space to fit your entire party. -I don't believe you can really \"customize\" your pasty (i.e. switching the type of meats)  My favorite is the Royale with Cheese. Get it with the both homemade BBQ sauce AND the thousand island sauce. It's basically a cheeseburger in pasty form and it's oh so good. Another favorite is the Pilgrim--sweet potatoes, chicken/turkey, and you HAVE to get it with the side of cranberry sauce. Delicious.",

The staff wasn't particularly welcoming either. I am going to try this place again, because I have heard so many good things about it from reputable people.

Parking can be a bit crazy on the weekends, but get there early and it's usually not a problem.  They've added on quite a bit, offering more seating options both indoors and outdoors.      I usually order off of their vegetarian menu, but they do have vegan options as well, while my carnivorous family will order off of the regular menu.  The hibiscus tea is our favorite, and they have a good selection of beers, which my picky husband enjoys.  Pasties run around $9 each, give or take a buck.  We usually get the veggie oggie, the veggie pesto chicken, the royale with cheese, the italian,  the mexican, and the chicken greek (either veggie or regular), and the chicken pot pie, and non-pasty options like the greek salad or the garlic oven chips or mashed potatoes.  I like the option of getting one half-baked so you can take it home and enjoy (plus it's cheaper!).  Oh, and the dessert pasties......YUM!  Peanut butter and jelly is our favorite, but we will get the apple caramel if the mood strikes us.  The strawberry pavlova is awesome as well.  I have not had a bad meal here...ever.     Depending on what day you go and where you sit (indoor vs. outdoor) service can be slow, but it's so worth it for the delicious food you get!",

Lots of vegetarian options (which is great when you have a vegetarian girlfriend) and even some rotating vegan options. Moderately good beer selection too, though I'd like to see twice as many on draft, but that's just because I like to try new things. All in all, one of my favorite places to eat.",

The jukebox has some really excellent music. The food of course is nomalicious. I highly recommend all their hand crafted soups. I've never had a pasty I didn't like. Of course, also save room for some dessert. The caramel pasty and the pavlova are both killer. The pavlova was so good I went home and learned how to make them so I could have them even when I didn't feel like putting on pants.

Ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad and the Chicken Pot Pie Pasty.  The Chicken Tikka Salad deserves 5 stars.  What a taste treat!  Loved the spicy tikka masala with the crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of red onions.  Nice contrast of hot and cold, spicy and mild.  And the mint yogurt dressing... spectacular.  Wonderful companion to the chicken and provided a \"cool\" contrast to the spiciness of the Tikka.  Kept in theme with the Indian spices with a modern salad dressing twist.  Excellent.  I'd love the have this salad often!  I was rather disappointed in the pasty.  The chicken was rather dry and I found it heavy on the thyme.  Veggies in it were tender and well cooked.  The crust was lovely:   light, flaky and flavorful.  I'd give this pasty a 3.    Service was good (a bit slow bringing the check at the end), ambiance had a British Isles pub feel.  Good experience over all and I'll be back for the Chicken Tikka Salad and to give a different pasty a try.",

    "text": "Lucky Mesa. You have a Cornish Pasty Company!   Today, we visisted the Mesa location, and it's quite different than the Tempe locale. Quite nice, in fact. There are two large patio's and this location (Mesa) is huge!   My hubby, the Brit, ordered \"Scotch Eggs\" which is a hard-boiled egg, wrapped in sausage, and quickly deep-fried. It's served with a mustard sauce, and a little salad on the side. My hubby was in Heaven.   We both ordered a cup of soup and a pasty. I had the tomato and it was delish. My hubby's gave me dish-envy: Leek, potato and Stilton cheese...OMG! Try it!   I had my normal \"Porky\" Pasty, and my hubby had the \"Lamb and Mint\" pasty. Both were served with that yummy gravy on the side, and both were fabulous!!   I can't say enough about these restaurants. They are both consistently wonderful food, play awesome music, and are an overall PERFECT experience!",

The roasted garlic oven fries \"chips\" were amazing perfectly cooked. I had the meat and cheese and my friend had the cajun chicken so we split it and each got half of each kind. ..server made us and I was soooo glad he did! ! I loved them both equally. . The red wine gravy is AWESOME and the home made thousand island is the perfect tang. I was less impressed with the banoofee dessert thing we tried but we will be back for pasty again",

We had no idea what a pasty was but looking at the menu online and it looked interesting. We were not disappointed. Both of our pasties were superb. We will be back in AZ next week and plan on dining here again. Wish they had these in Southern California.",

Perfectly cooked and flavorful; it's served with a side of marinara that I could have eaten alone with a spoon! Everything's good here. If your a soup lover you MUST try the mushroom soup.  My salad was fresh and their house dressing is this amazing creamy basil goodness.  The staff is very friendly and do a good job at paying attention to the little details.   The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the music is a little loud for this small of a space.  During lunch I think it could be turned down, save the loud music for happy hour.",

    "text": "Wow, I was definitely impressed by this restaurant. I don't normally like pasties or pies that aren't sweet. And the English aren't exactly famous for their cuisine. But Cornish Pasty Co pulls it off so well. They've got your straight up traditional pasties with meat and potatoes, but they've also got some Italian or Mexican fusion pasties.   Today, I got the Bangers and Mash - I thought I'd start out with something more traditional-sounding. Alex A. got the Chicken Alfredo. I liked mine better than his. The pasty crust was so moist and flaky - not at all hard and dry like what I usually get from pasties. My favorite part was the red wine gravy. It was AMAZING and totally pulled the entire pasty together. Alex's Chicken Alfredo, on the other hand, came with a marinara sauce, which I thought was too sweet/tomato-y. We also got a side of garlic/jalapeno chips, which actually means fries in British. They're super fresh and comes with the potato peels still on them.   The restaurant itself was also really nice. It does have that British pub feel. I thought the service was a little slow, but that's only because we were in a rush. I also thought that the food was a little pricey for how much we got, but the taste definitely makes up for it.",

My go to traditional pasty is the bangers and mash and when I feel like a little spice in my life I go with the Carne Adovada. If you really want to mix it up, try the chicken greek or the salmon.  Their soups are amazing. It took me awhile before I ever ordered soup at this place and now I never don't get at least a cup, even when its 110 degrees outside. The red pepper/chicken is where I started but now I can't get away from the cream of leak. I wasn't even sure what leaks were before I tried it and now I can't get enough. It has a certain addictive quality.  I also like the added apps and sides.   Love the bar. Service is good but has a strong hipster presence.   If you can handle tattoos and piercings along with great food and a nice beer selection this is must to check out.",

It's unbelievable to me how many different varieties of pies they make here.  If you look at the vegetarian menu alone you will find something like 15-20 different varieties from tikka masala to Mexican, veggie pesto, to even ground beef.  They always also have 2 vegan options which are quite good, the last one was with corn and veggies with a tomato red sauce side.  They also make really healthy salads to go with your pie which are reasonably priced.  There are two huge bar areas to eat at and it's a pretty friendly atmosphere.  The people who work here are very nice and very informative on all the options for beer and wine.  The options of beers on tap are very extensive.  The night I went they had a specialty dark beer that was something like 12% and they told me they were the only restaurant in the world to offer it.  Wished I remembered the name but it was definitely a sipper and lasted the whole meal and beyond.  The only other reason why I like the other location better is you can't really watch them make the pies here.  Part of the fun is watching the crew making these things way into the night.  It just ads to the ambiance but even without that this place is pretty darn fun and it sure never gets tiring to keep coming back.",

I assumed it was a mom and pop place with consistently good food (it outlasted many other businesses in the complex), but maybe a little boring. My sister suggested we go there for a family dinner and I was so surprised when I walked in! Finally, a reason to check that little box for \"hipster\" ambience on Yelp!   Every server who walked by greeted me and told me I could just take a seat, but unfortunately there was not a big enough table for my group, so we started the list, which just grew and grew as more people tried to get in for their pasties! They have great patio tables outside and long community tables and bar seats inside in their newly expanded space.   It was a little dark and loud once we finally sat - not good for an overly tired infant we had in tow or my dad who has a hard time hearing in loud settings. As I mentioned, all the servers were great, except for some reason, ours. She was very rushed and unfriendly unfortunately. But, despite that, I really liked the place!   They have a whole page for vegetarian pasties, but once I actually look, I wasn't too impressed that they rely heavily on Quorn (fake meat), but there were a few choices of just veggies and I could get the balsamic mushroom pasty and be happy every time! However, my mom got the same, but with chicken and thought the balsamic taste was a little strong. They ran out of their chips, so we had their coleslaw, which was good.   I definitely plan on going back, maybe trying their Tempe location for their happy hour!",

If you don't know what a good English--yet conspicuously American influenced--pub is like, this is your best shot in Arizona.   The food is well thought out and straight forward. Some of the Pasties may be a bit more flavorful than your traditional English oriented places but the flavors are wonderful, and I dare say, healthy. There is a Pasty for you in there somewhere!   This vegetarian and vegan friendly atmosphere is a find for those who want to sit back, enjoy a pint and enjoy a candlelit evening and relax for the day. If you're looking for \"vibe,\" you found your new place. The atmosphere reflects a relaxed and soulfully sophisticated crowd. Nothing bad to say about this place.",

Brash and rude, snappy and annoyed. 4 stars because the food is amazing and I'm hoping my next visit will be better",

This time I got to try one of their pasty, I got the Chicken Tikka Massala and it was delicious. The puff pastry is very good, and everything tastes homemade!  Our server (I do not recall his name, he had blond hair though) was very patient with us, especially when it was time to pay!

There was a story about in the menu. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary but I'll go back to try other items just to make sure I'm not missing anything. If I had to think about it... pasties are giant hot pockets that cost $10. Well, this is more of a time period food so I guess there's that additional cost to make it to represent it accurately. Although I don't think they had Mexican pasties back in the day. lololol.  It was kind of dark in there but I guess that's the mood they were going for. The entire place was mostly candle lit. Servers were nice. I say... good to go try it out at least once.",

She brought me a Greek salad, which, was huge and delicious!

We always have the Scotch egg, one of our favorites. Not too much sausage and cooked to perfection. Some places tend to over do it and you end up with a dry ball of \"stuff\". Not here. Love them. Had the wings on a previous visit and love them as well. I eat a lot of wings and these are quite good. Again, not over cooked like a lot of places, or over sauced.  As to the pastys we love them. My wife had the pot pie and I had the spicy Asiago chicken. Delightful. Crust was light and flaky and the fillings full of flavor. I really want to try them all. I don't know about the other locations, hopefully they are as good as this one.",

    "text": "The food was absolutely delicious! My parents and I had the vindaloo wings as an appetizer and I loved them! Probably because I don't like traditional hot wings to begin with but the spices were spot on! Hot as hell (temperature wise) so it was easy to trust they were fresh. We each had a different pasty: salmon, carne adovada and portobello chicken. They were all scrumptious and each had such a unique flavor. The seasoning on everything was perfect and the dough was nice and flaky. I'd say the portions are perfect as well, I would have been content with the first half but it was too good not to eat the whole pie! I also got the sticky toffee pudding. That was the first time I had it and it was pretty damn good too! It came in a mini cast iron pot with ice cream on the side. You could really taste the toffee glaze that was soaked into the pudding.   The only con I have is the service. Not that I wanted my dad to say anything but he told our waitress it was my birthday and she barely even batted an eye. The service was super slow and our waitress was not very attentive. We were there for over 2 hours and it took a while to just get every single thing we ordered from our drinks, appetizer, entrees and dessert. We waited at least 40 minutes before our entree and another 20 minutes for dessert. She didn't check in often and my glass was empty (I had ordered wine) for 15 minutes before she asked if I wanted another one. We sat at one of the community tables where 2 guys sat on the other end after finishing our appetizer and they had gotten their drinks/entrees at the same rate we were in the middle of eating ours. How did they get their stuff so much sooner than we did when they only had 1 less person in their party? I haven't a clue especially when the restaurant wasn't full.   Anyway, I would definitely go back for the food. The service has a lot of room for improvement.",

    "text": "If I ever leave Arizona, this will be at the top of my list of local places I will miss dearly. Whenever I've had a long, crappy day (or week, or month, or...), I usually find myself craving my go-to comfort food. This, my friends, is Cornish Pasty.  I wasn't always a believer. When I first heard about CP last year, I thought it sounded kinda weird. \"I don't think I'll like it,\" I told my Cult of Pasty friends. You can't accurately describe the glory that is a pasty to someone who has never experienced it. (As another reviewer noted, \"glorified hot pocket\" doesn't sound too appealing.) But if you haven't tried it yet, at least do it once, just so you don't have to wonder anymore. Seriously, just go.  I have never tried a pasty I didn't like. Ever. Thing is, I'm an extremely picky eater, and I dislike a lot of veggies (taste, texture, whatever, they weird me out). Yet this place can make me eat spinach, artichokes, tomatoes, onions, and potatoes like they're my favorite foods. Somehow, they magically combine a bunch of ingredients that sound like they may or may not go well together into one amazingly delicious, harmonious pocket of baked goodness. It's always perfect. I was especially hesitant to try the salmon pasty, but you know what? It's one of my favorites. Magic, I tell you.  But great food comes with a price. There's a good chance there will be a little wait here. There's also a good chance the service will be spotty, which is why I knocked off one star. On several occasions, our server has been extremely scarce, or food has come out at different times (as in, one pasty comes out and 15 minutes later, the other is out... doesn't make for a great dining experience with your partner). Mostly, we just have to wait to get anything we ask for, so bring your patience with you just in case.  My least favorite thing, though, is the door leading to the patio. That freaking door! On my last visit, it drove me CRAZY because every 15 seconds, someone would come in or out, and it would SLAM so audibly that I couldn't ignore it. I think it's just the door itself, but couldn't they like... make an effort to close it quietly, if they can't get it fixed? It was so distracting that I was having a hard time hearing conversations or enjoying my meal. There's no way I'm the only one bothered by this. Management, please fix ASAP.  But here's a great thing: when you're not in the mood to deal with being squished into a little bench with some strangers or searching for your waiter to get the water refill you needed 10 minutes ago, you can always call in your order, pick it up, and bake it at home - then sit down with your favorite beer or wine and enjoy your meal in privacy. Tastes just as delicious, I promise. Give it a try.",

    "text": "We have been coming to this place for awhile now and it is one of my favorite places to eat.  There are usually quite a few people inside sitting on the church pew seats and enjoying their meals off the old doors covered with glass tables.  The place is not fancy, but very different.  Decor is very simple with just black and white as the theme.  The people who work there are mostly college age kids.  They work hard here, dishing out awesome meals.  The food will not disappoint anyone.  The pickiest eater can find something  that will please them.  There are over 20 delicious pasties, many without meat.  Everything is cooked to order, so it takes abit to get your food, but the wait is worth it!  I usually go with my wife.  We like to sit near the bar at the patio doors.  I usually order the Greek pastie with an order of roasted potatoes, which I wash down with a Four Peaks Kilt Lifter beer (my fav!).  When you order the Greek, they give you little containers of tzatziki sauce  and some other sauce (which I am not fond of).  This is an especially awesome place to go to when it is really cold out as they use these huge ovens inside to bake your food, and it is really nice and toasty there.  In the summer, they have two patios to enjoy the fresh air.  So remember if you want a meal that is different, filling and comfortable at a decent price, this is the place to go.  There is another location in Tempe, but I have not been there yet.",

    "text": "First tried cornish pasty at the location out in scottsdale a very long time ago, but I remember loving it. So when my girlfriend at the time said that she wanted to try it, I was all for it. The experience, however, was quite different than the first.       When we first walked in, there is no check in desk/podium/table. As soon as you walk in the door, you can go right or left because the tables are immediately in front of you. We walk to the left and come across 2 teenage girls who look about 15-16 who say hello to us. They aren't wearing any uniforms, colored shirts, or even t-shirts with the company name on them. Not sure if they work there, I respond with a hello. After an awkward pause, they finally ask if we'd like a table and for how many. After giving this info, they look around the room and say that there are no tables available \"except for the tiny 2 tops up against the wall which were immediatley in front of the entrance\". I politely decline, and say we will wait at the bar for a better seat. 30 minutes later, they come and say our table is ready and its the same table, only this time, on the other side of the entrance. So we give up and just order food from the bar. The bartenders were the only redeeming quality  and only reason that this isn't a 1-star review. The food was ok, came late though but at least the bar staff was nice. Definitely would not recommend this place to take your date.",

He has elevated the humble pasty (comfort food for coal miners) into collection of international meals enclosed in pastry. I have eaten 90% of the pasty menu and every single pasty was well crafted and bursting with flavor. My favorites are: Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka, Lovely Bit 'O Salmon, and Bangers+Mash. Always ask for double sauce!  There is a fine line-up of beer on tap, including hard to find ones like Dogfishhead 90 Min IPA. I usually do Guinness or a Black+Tan, all poured properly.  It's fun to watch staff make the pasties. They are a tattooed, funky bunch -- you will never find a more gracious group or more dedicated to getting the product right, though.  I enjoy the Mesa location with family, but prefer the grittier \"coal mine-like\" atmosphere of the original Tempe location if I'm alone or with the guys.",

It's a huge bowl filled with a really wonderful sweet meringue topped with lightly sweetened whipping cream, strawberries, kiwi  then  topped with a generous drizzle of raspberry coulis.

    "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for ages now and finally we were in the area so we went.  We drove around the stupid little shopping area forever just trying to find the restaurant until we discovered that the address is slightly misleading.  In case this happens to you, it is facing Dobson and a little bit south of Guadalupe.    I absolutely loved the decor of the restaurant, very minimalist, lots of black and white with a really eclectic mix of old, new, and industrial furnishings.  I really liked the church pews for the booths.  They could stand to have a better air conditioning system because the fairly open kitchen and the constant opening and closing of the ovens makes it get warm inside pretty quickly.  The food I thought was fantastic.  The menu has a TON of different pasties to choose from, so there is definitely something on the menu for everyone, even vegetarians.  I chose the meat and cheese pasty which was pork sage sausage with a couple different cheeses inside.  When it came out, it looked beautifully golden brown on the outside.  I really really liked the pastry portion.  The inside was equally as good too.  The sausage was really delicious.  It was simple but so full of flavor.  My main gripe about this place is that they don't make the pasties fresh.  I watched the guys in the kitchen pull them out of the refrigerator/freezer.  However, even though this happens, they still taste delicious and fresh.  They probably just make them the morning of, as I can imagine they are quite time consuming to prepare.  Great place!",

The atmosphere is fun, and not quite what I expected, with church pews and an industrial sort of feel. Our server was attentive. The only downside was that it seemed a little loud - not the music but the chatter of other people seemed to overwhelm the place.   I'd like to go back and try their desserts sometime.  It was a little difficult to find this place - it's tucked away in a corner in the plaza right on the corner of Guadalupe and Dobson. We went right past it at first.",

The first time was in June...I met up with a fellow gamer (geek alert...yes, I do play an MMORPG and no, it's not WoW) who lives around the corner from me. I didn't eat a pasty, bad me! Instead, I had their chicken caesar salad. Good lord I'd died and gone to heaven with a dish like that...not too much dressing, tons of leafy lettuce and chicken that was cooked just right!  We loved the idea of the pews. I liked it because it reminded me of being back in Scotland. :D  Service rocked it! Friendly and kick ass, prompt! They are making me fall in love with them.  A month later, I take hubby there...I order the same thing...and am massively disappointed. The lettuce is wilted, chicken is the best part of the salad and sadly, there is so much dressing I was distraught.  Again, service rocked it...but hubby was most impressed with the happy hour prices of the beers and the size...and the selection. He wasn't happy with is pasty which was ok by my standards.  Today I had a craving for a pasty. Hopped over there and had their chicken tikka. It was aight. Nothing to make me do cartwheels or dance on the tables. Ok, if I danced on the tables, I'd really be embarrassed because my ass would break it. I'm sure of it.  Anyway, I'll give this place another whirl next month and see how it goes. Maybe it might be good.  So far they're consistently inconsistent in the food, but their service is top notch.",

This restaurant gives me a new perspective, and I think that a fast-food nation could in fact get elegantly poised over a hot plate of Cornish heaven. Such is the power of this convenience food.   The bangers and mash is the closest to the original recipe of the pasty and therefore is a must try. 'The Italian' is scrumptious but is not the smartest thing to go in for at a British eatery. For a more wholesome meal a side of mushy peas seasoned with salt and pepper is a good order.   The decadent mix of colonial English interiors and ultramodern music weaves magic on Pasty Company customers, making them want to come back time and again.",

Staff seemed friendly enough, although my waitress never came to check on us after bringing our food - a major pet peeve of mine.  Now for the food. Hubby ordered the peppered steak pasty and it was delicious. I got the chicken greek and it was just ok. Needed a little something more, maybe feta cheese or more kalamata olives. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. Hubby was thrilled with the generous beer selection. I just had water with lemon. WARNING: the water tastes terrible! I had to add about 4 lemon wedges in order to make it even palatable.  I think we will try CPC again, just based on the reviews here on Yelp. I feel like maybe we went on an \"off\" night, or maybe I need to try a more traditional pasty. We'll see.",

The pasties were the same delicious taste of home that i have become addicted to and like the Tempe restaurant they have a great selection of beers.  The CPC is a breath of fresh air in an area full of chain restaurants and so I will be back for more pasties and beer for sure!  P.S This location has great outdoor seating for lazing the day away over a few beers with mates.",

I took my niece at least 10 minutes to decide on the chicken pesto pasty. I had the veggie Mexican.  The pasty is a meal, we left without having to discuss eco friendly to go containers. I always bring it up, my niece always mocks me. My eco activism isn't always consistent. We had I light flavored beer the waitress recommended. OK she loved the pesto chicken, I enjoyed the Mexican... We both are looking forward to your next visit. For me repeat visits are a True testament to a rave review. Peace!",

I got the spicy asiago chicken pasty and it was great; and I think I might go back already today, and get the Rosemary chicken! yay finally a place with a little culture :)",

Nice, quaint atmosphere, roomy seating, great beer selection.  When our food arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was, especially the gravy.  More importantly, my fiancee was over the moon at how the crust tasted \"just like Nan's\" .  We will definitely come back again.",

    "text": "After years of meaning to do it, we finally checked out the Cornish Pasty Company.   I had the Oggie with a side of mashed potatoes and a Boddingtons. The wife had the Lamb Vindaloo and we shared a cider. We also had a side of chips and our niece had a salad. The food was very good over all, and I would say the Vindaloo was outstanding (I took a few bites off my wife's plate). Please don't order it if you can't stand spiciness though. Too many restaurants nowadays are wimping out on spice because people order something they can't handle and send it back to the kitchen or complain (try finding truly hot buffalo wings these days, for instance). But for spice lovers, it was A-1.   These things take awhile to bake, so don't go if you're in a big hurry. They had one lady waiting the tables, and as time went by the place got busier and busier. But she kept up with it somehow, and just when I thought she would surely forget something, it would arrive. It was very impressive, actually. The food did arrive a little out of order, again, thanks to the baking time. But it was not a big problem.   Someone else has mentioned the good music they play on the jukebox and the nice seating they have outside. Add to that a decent beer selection and you have a darn good experience. We'll be back for sure.",

Also, when I order B&M, I expect it to have peas.  That's just the way I am used to it and, when it doesn't have them, it is missing part of the flavor.  That really screwed with my expectations of the order (that also took forever) and is why I didn't give them four stars.  The quality was extremely high and the sausage was amazingly good.  The presentation was nice and the red wine sauce was the perfect compliment.  Totally a good meal for a decent price.    I would recommend this place for a pasty - just not for British food.  They are a one trick pony but at least they do it well.",

And when someone explained it to me, I was like, \"Ew-I don't know about this.\" Well let's say I was very wrong! Pasties are the yummiest things ever. I dream about the Veggie Greek. Their mushroom walnut soup with fresh baked bread on the side is divine. The desserts...OMG, so amazing. Try the Shirley Temple pudding if you're a toffee lover, or the chocolate bread pudding if you're a chocolate lover. I happen to be both! The staff is friendly and takes good care of you. The location in Mesa is definitely bigger with more tables available, but we go to the one in Tempe too because it's closer to work. My only complaint, and perhaps why I didn't go with 5 stars is the way the first come-first serve seating works, especially at Mesa, because there will be a party of 2 taking up one of the huge booths (made with real church pews--how cool is that?) even when there are smaller tables available, and then our party of 4-6 will have to hang around and wait. But it is always worth the wait :)",

I ordered four, had two gave away the other two - I was all Pasty out by the second one.. Feels like a fancy hot pocket with fresh ingredients.  I ordered the meat & cheese which is nice if your craving something cheesy.  Also had the Sheppard pie which has a nice smooth potatoes flavor with meat.. These are nice for Sharing since they cut them in half and the sauce they have is real nice.. I had the red wine sauce with both.. Good.. Each pasty is under $10, good deal and these good to eat on the go.. I Also ordered the Strawberry Pavola $5, Only came with Strawberries no grapes or kiwi's as it suppose too.. The meringue shell was good, the sauce was sweet but I would go easy on it, the cream was so - so but overall good can be too sweet if you top too much sauce and cream...  Not sure if I would return, even though it was good but not enough for me to be wowed..",

I love this friend, but her proximity to magical pasties may be contributing to my frequent visits. I've sat at the bar, at a church pew table inside, and at a booth outside under the misters (during the short-lived reprieve from this heat). The bar is cool, you can watch the kitchen staff weigh out the pasty ingredients and craft those life-changing vessels of goodness. And get second, third, and fourth carbombs rather quickly. Which, by the by, are $3. All. The. Time. I've sampled many a pasty, as I've usually been with a group. Have to say the Carne Adovada has by far been my favorite, with the Royale with Cheese coming in at a close second. Mmmmm Thousand Island dressing, hello! The decor is pretty awesome, understated. Definitely, definitely, definitely do the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. It will not disappoint.",

So after researching on the internet, we came across the Cornish Pasty Company. After reading other reviews, and visiting the web site, as well and researching what a pasty is, we both decided that this was the spot to go. Apon walking in, the smell took us by suprise, was a little overwealming for we both have never smelt nothing like it before, but being in there after a few we started adjusting and relizing how much we both enjoyed the ambiance. Apparently its one of the main spices they use in pastys. There service was really good, out waittress was extremely good. The one thing that impressed both my and I was that even the othere waitreses and waiters would ask us if we needed anything and how every thing was going. Oh yeah,  by the way. The food was awsome.",

The Pasty is a unique little pocket of delight!  Originating as traditional miner's fare in Cornwall, England, the Pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting, nontraditional Pasties upon it's arrival to Tempe, AZ.  Although the more traditional Shepard's pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor, there is now a Royal with Cheese, a Chicken Tikka Masala, and many more fun-filled pasties to try!  For those of you that have had a Pasty in England, this will not be what you are expecting because the Pasty here is much larger.  There are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.  Go without the expectation for traditional English fare and the Pasty will not disappoint!  Aside from the yummy pasties, the setting of The Cornish Pasty is cozy and fun.  The Jukebox there is awesome....playing everything, classic rock, psychedelic, new wave, etc.  At night, the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.  They have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a long indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.  The staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and alluring and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.  They serve a nice assortment of beer in a nice array of sizes.  I love the Pasty and I love to recommend it because it is unique and just plain delicious!  If you haven't had a pasty yet, you should!!",

That was OK  as we were able to chat without yelling @ each other, and were able to chat a little bit with Heidi. Great gal...very friendly service. I ordered the Oggie (The Traditional Pasty), mushy peas (mainly after gauging my friend's expression of comfort to see them on the menu...childhood memories no doubt), and chips (potato wedges). I wasn't overwhelmed by the food. However, is English food ever overwhelming?. The pasty was a little dry and the wine gravy takes some getting used to. Although the beef was lean, it wasn't too tender. I can't say I'd recommend on the food, but the Strongbow Cider and the Hoegaarden were both pretty good. Also stuck around to play some Cricket @ the dartboard, which probably wouldn't have normally been available. I think it seems like a good place to have some drinks with friends, and soak up a good crowd atmosphere on a busier night.",

One of the things I really like about this new location (aside from the outside booths) is the extended menu with lots more vegetarian options. So many things to choose it made deciding difficult. The Shepard's Pie made with Quorn Veggie Ground Round was way too salty (I think the chef should have tasted it to realized it's not like ground beef and comes already somewhat flavored and doesn't need more salt), but the other pasty I had with eggplant was wonderful. Looking forward to going back again this week to try different dishes.",

I must say though the flavors in the greek chicken one were seriously amazing, artichoke hearts... sun dried tomatoes just so good.  I will be going back hopefully sometime soon. In the meantime  I  want a vat of the sauce to swim in at home",

Was hoping to get a better happy hour special than I did, but that wasn't the reason I was there. Ordered the lamb shepards pie pasty and was blown away. The little red wine gravy was mind blowing as well. I'll definitely be heading back here more often.",

    "text": "I'm in Phoenix a handful of times a year, and typically visit chain restaurants. But, I've decided to make an honest attempt at supporting local businesses, so... thanks to Yelp, found Cornish Pasty Co! It's always kind of hard relying solely on Yelp reviews - typically, when I decide to go with a Yelp recommendation, I've heard someone mention it in conversation or I've read an article about it.   I am happy to report that the rating for this place is spot on! I ordered the tikka masala pasty, and my husband ordered the reuben. Husband said it's the reuben he's ever had (though, I disagree) and my pasty was so delicious, I continued to eat it despite being overfull. Husband was very pleased with the beer he selected as well.  Told my MIL about it & hope she tries it out soon, as she typically sticks with restaurants that she is familiar with. Looking forward to going back over the holidays!",

    "text": "Who has been hiding this place from me. Right in my old old neighborhood. Down the street from my high school. Obviously this place wasn't here when I lived in this area way back in the day. Otherwise I would really have kicked myself. My girlfriend introduced me to this place and she is the best for bring me here. I love everything about this place. The atmosphere is great. A little dark but it works. The whole place is lit with real candles. They actually come around and replace them when they get low. Very cool. Great beer selection too. Some I have never even heard of but want to try. I didn't know what to get so the waitress got me a sample of a Scottish ale it was good so I got a pint. I want to come back and try the rest. We also got the oven baked chips with garlic and jalapeno. Chips = fries people come on get with it. They were awesome. Some of the best fries I have ever had. Although I will say the jalapenos didn't quite make sense. I like jalapenos don't get me wrong but they were just chopped up on top. When you picked up a fry they fell off. If you managed to get a few to stick they would come off when you dipped it in the sauce. You can bypass the sauce and just eat one but they didn't really add anything. If they were baked into to the chips that might be better. Still very good regardless. Now on to the Pasties. The reason you came here and the name of the place. I have never had a pasty before but from looking at the menu you can put pretty much anything you want inside of one. They have an Italian one, cheesesteak one, Greek one, a few Mexican flavored ones and so on and so on. You name it it was in a pasty. I finally decided on the spicy chicken asagio one with some advice from my girlfriend who has been here before. Sure it takes awhile for the food to come out but they are making it when you order it. By the time you sip on your drinks and munch on those fantastic chips your food comes out so it works out. So good. Flavor was perfect. Everything all crammed in there but all working together. The dipping sauces they give you with it work perfectly. They vary depending on which pasty you order. Don't be shy pick it up with your hand and munch away. No shame in it. That is really how you are supposed to eat them anyway. I can't wait to come back and try the other great pasties. I have to say I might be addicted. So good and such a great place.",

    "text": "After a long hike, my group of 6 was starving and I decided that we should check out the Cornish Pasty Co, in Mesa. We ordered a variety of pasties: the Royale w/ cheese, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Alfredo and the Reuben.  Now, you may wonder...what the HELL is a pasty? First of all, it's pronounced 'pass-tee', which is a meat pie. Not to be mistaken for 'pace-tee', used to describes a person's pale complexion or those nipplage stickers burlesques dancers use.   It's the British version of a Spanish empanada. And, IT IS HUGE!! I like huge....food... ;o)  I ended up ordering the Shepherd's Pie. The flaky shell crust hides the meat and potatoes, on the inside.  The meat was well seasoned, super yummy and blended well, with the mashed potatoes. I was craving for more, after my first bite. Actually, it was so good, I can still imagine the taste of the pasty, in my mouth. Hello, drool!  A single pasty will cost you about $8. It's enough to fill up a single adult. We didn't get sides, this time around.  But, we will next time.  And, oh yes, there WILL be a next time!!  The church pews are a nice touch.  The service super friendly and helpful.  I got no complaints and I will come here, again. Oh, why don't we have one like this in San Diego?!? Why? Why? WHY?!?  Until the next time Cornish Pasty Company..... *le sigh*",

    "text": "Quite possibly the best place to eat in Mesa. Let me tell you what you are in for if you go.   The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level.  Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepard's Pie. The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well. If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden it's the best I've ever had. If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs. Or if you are you are up to it go with both.  When your pasty arrives don't touch the plate! It could be scorching bloody hot. Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well, just stay clam it will cool soon enough.   When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert. By now you will feel very full, I know, I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it.  Cheers!",

You see, the trendy douche-bag factor is really high.  I mean really high.  It is a testament to just how good the food is that I keep going there to eat.  And the pasties are worth it.  Trust this fat chick, I know good food.  My fave is the Oggie, which is the original classic, filled with deliciousness.  The husband likes the bangers & mash.  They offer a wide variety of pasties on the menu, something for everyone.  Are you in the mood for Thanksgiving dinner, they put it in a pasty and serve it up.  Tikka masala curry? Italian pizza? Vegetarian? They have a pasty for every craving you have.  Even desert.  I want to try a desert pasty sometime, but I'm always too stuffed.  Another option is the ploughman's plate, an appetizer assortment of cheese, fruit, bread and other goodies.  It's a bit expensive, but quality and portion are commensurate with the price.  As I've said before, I don't balk at paying fair market price for quality.  Did I mention the extensive beer list? They've got that too.  Give this place a try.  I guarantee you'll be back for more.",

    "text": "If you haven't been to Cornish Pasty, please set aside your computer, get into your car, and drive to one right this very moment.   It is so unlike anywhere else around, and yet exactly what I wish all restaurants would try to be.   My first Cornish Pasty visit was to the original Tempe location when it was a long narrow hallway with a bar and 2 tops crammed into it. I remember loving the food and wishing for a bit more comfort. We waited impatiently for the \"new\" location to open at Dobson and Guadalupe and immediately made it our regular place as it was larger and easier to get to.   Cornish Pasty Co is smart, as they not only expand to additional locations but also grow their existing locations. They've extended their Tempe location significantly since my first visit, and the Mesa location first added a beautiful patio and then a huge addition that expanded the dining room, added a bar, and made the patio even larger.   Their patio is definitely a great place to dine, with high backed booths that can easily seat 6 and even as many as 8 if you're willing to get cozy. It is a bit quieter than the indoor seating area, which makes it ideal for groups or couples that might want to have an easier time making conversation. I also love that the way it has been built creates ambiance within the patio itself and blocks the view of the parking lot. They have fans and misters, but unfortunately AZ is just too darn hot to allow you to enjoy it during the summer months.   The indoor seating is extensive and varied, and the decor is awesome! Most/all of the furniture is handmade or reclaimed/repurposed. They are the first place I saw using old doors as tabletops and church pews for benches (these tables are huge and easily seat 8 people, which is nice when you're with a big group) The color scheme is unique - dark woods with a lot of black paint, white walls, melted wax candles, and black and white photos of miners on the walls (pasties were historically used as lunches for miners in Europe) There is a \"drinkin'\" bar on one side of the dining room and a bar top looking into the kitchen on the other side.   On my most recent visit, they were pretty full and we were given the option of sitting up at the kitchen bar. I hadn't sat up there before and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was! They have an elevated platform running beneath the bar which makes it easy for shorter people (like me) to clamber up unto the barstool without too much difficulty. They also had purse-hooks (all high tables should have these) in the form of carabiners that clip onto your purse strap - awesome!  I will say that sitting up by the kitchen in the middle of summer is a bit warmer than the surrounding seating... I initially worried I was going to regret our seating choice but our lovely server, Stephanie, showed up quickly to take our order and provided giant glasses of ice cold sodas and tea, then kept 'em coming. Stephanie was awesome and provided a few great suggestions (mixing two of the sauces for my husband's Meat and Cheese Pasty, for example) - she was prompt and fun. Sitting up at the counter had the added benefit of being able to watch the magic of the kitchen unfold - their chefs WORK! It was fun to see and they all seemed to be having a pretty good time with one another - I appreciated seeing how the team worked well togdether and the manager was bantery and encouraging to all of the staff.  The food... so good! Seriously have never had anything that isn't good. My go-to pasty is the Porky (although it is embarassing to order... kinda like \"Moon over My Hammy\" at Dennys) - it is closest to the types of pasties I grew up eating in the midwest - Pork, potatoes, onion, red wine gravy - wrapped up in a delicious crust. The portion size is perfect; if you're hungry, it'll fill you up, and if you're not so hungry, you eat one half and take the other to reheat later. Either way you win. I've also enjoyed the Italian, and my husband recently got the Meat and cheese that was amazing with a mix of Chipotle and Barbeque sauces (on our server's recommendation)   That said, one day a few years ago I went rogue and ordered soup instead of a pasty (WHAT?) Specifically, the Potato, Leek, Stilton Soup. It is incredible, you guys. Perfect, hearty, and warm during the winter but also so good that I order it even though it is 112 degrees outside. It also comes with generous pieces of homemade bread perfect for dipping or slathering with tasty butter. Now I get it every. freaking. time. and I miss out on the pasties because I just can't help it.   I've also had their Wings (delicious - sweet with a little bit of spice) and their chips (big steak-fries that do not typically come out earlier than the rest of the food)   We've had desserts before but it has been a really long time. I remember liking the fruit Pavlova as well as the Banoffee tart,",

Oggie, veggie oggie, lamb vindaloo, carne adovada, etc., and the list goes on, and will continue to grow as I eat my way through the menu.  This is a great place for vegetarians as well since they use Quorn and faux ground beef.  My veggie oggie was almost indistinguishable in taste from a regular oggie.  Dessert is also excellent.  I've had the apple caramel pasty and it was the perfect way to end our meal.  This is a must-eat-at restaurant.  Plus, with enough happy hour car bombs ($2 after 10 PM, and from 3-5 PM), you can giggle inwardly (or outwardly) at the thought of eating something called \"pasty\" (yes, even though it really is pronounced Pass-teee).",

    "text": "We have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. We actually had gone out earlier that evening. As we drove past the area, we both kind of thought the same thing and I turned into the parking lot. As we walked up to the establishment, the patio was about half full so that is of course a great sign. We walked in and the place was definately hopping. The bar was about two thirds full and the tables were all taken as well. Again, a good sign that people like to come here :)  So we took the two seats up at the bar closest to the entrance just in case we need to make a quick get away if we do not like it...just kidding. I like the fact that the crowd of people that come here are varied. It is nice to have a place that every different type of person can go an ejoy a drink or two with company they keep. After ordering a few drinks we looked over their menu. I thought I died and went to fat heaven. So many things sounded delicious...especially their desserts. After a quick and conjoined consensus, we decided to order the 'chips' and then split the chicken pot pie pasty.  Before we were fed, I noticed a few pretty great things about this place. They actually use wax candles instead of the crappy oil burning ones most places do now a days. On top of that, they were placed inside old Jameson and vodka bottles! (See picture) Just adding the the already dimly lit casual bar feel of this place. there are a few pictures and things hung around the high walls for a effect but the thing to really notice is the benches they use for the long tables in the front center of the restaurant. (See picture) They are old church pews! Ha! There are very few things that impress me with astonishment and this is one of them. Whoever thought of this was a very smart man/woman.  Okay, so back to the food... when it came out I could just tell by looking at is it would be good. (See pictures) The 'chips' also known as french fries around these parts :) were probably some of the best I have ever tasted in my entire life. I am almost positive they rank within the top 3 for sure. They were freshly cut, seasoned and fried to the ideal consistancy. They were soft where they should be and crispy around the edges like fried should be as well. I really appreciate when cooks take that extra step into paying attention to culinary detail.  Then moving on to the pot pie pasty (say that 5 times fast). It was absolutely delicious! You could tell all the vegetables were fresh. The filling was not too heavy (saucy) which I truly appreciate as I was already feeling guilty about the amount of food I was about to partake in. My only suggestion was it needed a hint of salt and black pepper for more flavor but I think maybe they do this on purpose for those that are sensitive to overly spiced foods. Either way, I really do like the authenticity and quality of this place. Really? Only $9 for these enormous pasties? Fantastic! We will definately be back. Next time I think I might just have to indulge in the bread pudding as that is one of my favorite guilty pleasures in life. Cheers!",

Interior is dimly lit, black drapes over the windows. There are a couple of decent pool tables. Lounge has large fluffy leather couches. Then there is a large dinning area where you could conceivably have a party of twenty or Thirty people. There is a wrap around porch with outdoor seating as well.

The menu explains the pastry and it's a interesting story.  I grew up with meat and potato's so I was expecting something like my mom's pot roast, but within a pastry shell.  What I didn't expect was that little bit of mint in mine.  I ordered the lamb and mint but didn't expect it to be savory and stand out, but it was good.  I also tried the desert pastries, be ready to wait, they take a while to bake, but it was worth it.  Shirley Temple's pudding, sticky toffee pudding, imported British treacle, and served with creme anglaise.  We enjoyed the food, and we enjoyed the service.",

This is one of the more interesting 'homesy' places in Phoenix that I enjoy going to and taking out of town visitors to.    The restaurant itself is very simple, it is very narrow and rectangular.  Most of the seating is at the bar/counter, which is right on the other side of the food preparation area.  There are about six or seven tables in the place, and they are all pushed up to the one wall that isn't the kitchen.    I have only good things to say about the food.  I watched mine be prepared from scratch as well as many other dishes and their ingredients are extremely fresh.  If you're crass like myself you could boil everything down to gourmet hot pockets.  The crust is flaky and just hard enough to keep it's shape, and there is almost no end to the ingredients you can order inside, from the traditional to the exotic.    I also noticed they had some great beers in stock.  I've never walked in to a Phoenix restaurant (excluding those attached to breweries) and seen Chimay on the menu.    All-in-all a great place to eat, I've been back a few times since my first visit and been pleased every time.",

The atmosphere was very laid back which I expected due to the impression I got from my friends. I expected the aforementioned laid back atmosphere, excellent service and great food. However, my expectations were not met completely.   Instead of tables and chairs, the restaurant was lined with pews and tables. I found the Catholic pews to be a nice touch, but uncomfortable; I felt awkward sitting there. The pews were far from the table, which forced me to sit straight up as if I were in church instead of a eating establishment. The only positive thing about the pews was the camaraderie my friends and I shared about not being able to comfortably reach the table.   The food was decent, however, it was lukewarm. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasty and found it to be mediocre, due to the temperature of the dish. It was served with a side of spicy dressing, that added to the dish. I had a soda to drink, which was refilled once despite my draining of the glass.   The service was abominable. Our server, Mike, who might have been nice to look at, only checked on us once. During our dining expedition, he was listening to his iPod instead of working. He was also more interested in his own meal as opposed to asking us how our meal was. In addition to all of this, he was doing dishes on the counter where our food was waiting to be served.",

    "text": "You shouldn't leave a restaurant feeling upset and humiliated.  But we did!  Earlier tonight, my son jokingly said that he wanted British food for dinner.  Having heard the stories of our adventures in England and just how bad the food was there, this is a bit of a running joke in our house.  But then I thought of all of the amazing reviews about this place on Yelp, and how we thought it might become a regular haunt for us.  So we hopped in the car with our two kids and headed out.  After parking, we walked up to the restaurant, where 3 people were sitting below the entry door and patio.  We went up to the door and looked around, not quite sure where to go.  There was no staff, and no obvious stand with a hostess, but I saw two empty big booths outside on the patio.  So I left my husband and two kids standing around by the door outside while I went inside.  I was greeted by the side of a bar.  Still no staff or obvious hostessing area.  I walked across the restaurant and saw a couple of empty tables, another empty table outside, and a lot of space up at the bar.  The only staff were standing at the kitchen bar area, and one girl was loading up with plates.  Still no obvious hostess.  I told the girl that we were new and had never been there before, and asked if we just seat ourselves.  She said \"Yeah\".  I said \"Great, we'll sit outside then.  Will somebody know to come serve us?\"  Again--affirmative.  So I went back outside and told my husband we could sit down.  At this point, one of the two booths had been taken and so we seated ourselves at the other.  My husband grabbed menus and we were browsing the menus.  The server came and greeted us, and half way through his greeting he just walked away over by where we entered.  I saw one of the people who'd been sitting by the door pointing over at us.  The server came back and told us that there was a waiting list (the three people by the door were now five).  He apologized, but we knew we were being ejected from our table.  The people at the table next to us were staring, and I was feeling guilty and humiliated that we had apparently stolen someone's table.  Feeling extremely uncomfortable after both the lack of any greeting and having to track down staff AND their lack of communication, plus having other customers' eyes on us and obviously having angered the people waiting, we opted to leave.  I was feeling completely humiliated and ended up being upset for quite a while.  Sooo.. they may have great food, but I really have no desire to go back.  Hopefully they can work on greeting customers and their communication issues.  Obviously it wasn't meant to be a new regular joint for us.",

And the one and only missing piece that, in my opinion is the MOST IMPORTANT component would be the severs.  My part of 4 was sat on one of the long tables right in the front with a really cool drip candle in a Jamesen bottle in front of us.  The host was totally cool.  I really liked his vibe and he seemed to be generally concerned for getting everyone sat and happy.  But then our server came.  We told her we've never been here before and have no idea what a pasty was.  I was expecting a  whole discription of what they were, what to expect, and good recommendations, but we didn't get any of that.  Instead she just started pointing to different ones on the list and didn't really help with our decision making.  We thought that the baked chips would come out as an appetizer and wanted to ask her when they would be out but she literally didn't come back to our table for 40 minutes.  She just dropped off our beer and water, took our order, and then just forgot about us until we asked the gentleman who was switching out our candle to get her for us.  At that point, she just brought our food and didn't come ask us what we wanted after the guy asked her to come talk to us.  Like I said, the food was so good...when it finally came.  But our waitress was just so sub-par, that I won't go back to that location.  I will go to the Tempe one next time and see how that one pans out.",

Pasty is our go-to spot for casual, \"no-frills\" dining- great spot for enjoying some drinks/darts/pool with friends, and great food. Portions huge, prices are very fair, decent wine and beer selection, always cool music playing, love the laid-back vibe and casual atmosphere. Waitstaff is always pleasant. Variety of pasties on the menu is fantastic- really appreciate the vegetarian options (thank you!). Food quality is consistently- we've tried various menu options and all have been delicious, over and over again. My only suggestion (if I may) would be just a few more salads and a broth-based soup. Love the new side room recently added on- such cool, eclectic decor. Nothing \"typical\" about Pasty- in all the right ways!",

Our server was effective and checked on us often without being too intrusive.

    "text": "If you are reading these reviews and have never indulged in the tasty delights served by Cornish Pasty Company, you must get your ass over there as soon as possible!  The variety of options is astounding for a place with a menu largely dominated by a single item: the humble pasty.  Nearly every major cuisine is represented, and for the vegetarians, this place is mecca, because there are just as many options on that side of the menu as the omnivorous one.  They also have a few sides (Cauliflower and Broccoli Cheese Bake is f*cking INCREDIBLE), salads, soups, and desserts.  Strangely enough, I've never tried any of the desserts, but they all look amazing.  Me and the boyfriend's favorite flavors include Rosemary Steak, Lovely Bit of Salmon, Bangers and Mash, Peppered Steak, and The Royale with Cheese (yes, they have a cheeseburger option, perfect for a picky kid, just don't let them eat the whole thing!)  And speaking of portion size, don't think when you first behold your precious pasty that it is nothing to write home about in terms of size.  That little football will fill you to the brim, (this is probably the reason I've never had their desserts!)  They are great to split with a friend along with a salad or other side, if you are looking to lighten it up a bit.  I can't really comment on the service.  Since the Mesa location is a quarter mile from our house, we always order out.  From what I can tell, they are packed every night.  We never have any problems with our order, though now I think of it, the last time I called to place one, the phone just rang and rang with no answer, and we ended up getting My Arepa.  No big, though.  I'm so glad this concept is expanding in the Valley, Cornish Pasty is quickly becoming an institution in this town, so if you haven't been yet, make it happen!",

My friend suggested going to the Mesa location because there is more seating than the one in Tempe. It has a cool vibe...  kind of a modern English pub. There are large communal tables, a long bar, and a patio to choose from. With haboob #2 looming in the sky, we decided to share an inside table with 3 cool strangers.  I was with a party of 5 and we all loved our orders. I had the carne adovada - shredded pork with green chilis and great spicy flavors. Loved every bite. We also shared the apple, cinammon, caramel pasty for desert. I loved this too. Maybe more. Maybe not. Both were just so darn good.   It seems like the perfect place for a meat and potatoes sort of guy, plus I heard there's a great selection of English beers, so I'm planning to take my boyfriend there for dinner asap (twice in one week wouldn't be overkill right?)

It is open until 12Midnight and I would be curious what the crowd is like then. The floor is set up like a dining hall, not a bar (no real mingling space, long German style tables on a tightly packed floor) [might get rowdy in a good way]. The selection on draft beers was mildly impressive but they were out of the German Lager I wanted....but Guinness will do.

All of them are totally delicious, fresh, and the ingredients are obviously good quality. The sauces they make are all excellent and flavorful, although I prefer the red wine gravy with lamb or beef, not turkey or chicken.  The prices are totally reasonable. At first you think it's steep for what is essentially a handheld pot pie, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. I can only ever eat half and take the other half home.   Sides are also tasty. Haven't tried the drinks or desserts but I assume they are just as good!   Service is a little spotty (they seem to employ affable, somewhat spacey young men). But I suppose that's kind of in line with a British place, huh? ;)  Something I find disappointing, though, is that you cannot customize any of the pasties. If you don't like an ingredient in it, you have no choice but to order something else. I get that they prep the pasties earlier in the day to maximize efficiency in baking, but still.  This location is really nice and I prefer it to the location near ASU. Great outdoor seating area, misters, lots of shade, etc.  I will be back many times, I am sure.",

A group of 8 of us sat outside on a Friday evening... the waitress was awesome, keeping up with our beers and everything :) I went with the safe choice, I think it was called \"the Italian\", but it was filled with marinara sauce and meat (maybe sausage and/or peperoni). It was very tasty- reminded me of a stromboli with a thinner, flakier crust. Next time I'll try something more adventurous, I swear :) I did have a bite of the bf's \"lamb and mint sauce\" pasty and that was very good too (I'm not a total food wuss... really, I'm not).

If I lived walking distance I would get so fat eating here. Their food is too good!! Their beer selection is solid as well, and I have yet to be disappointed by their wine.

    "text": "Stayed in Tempe for several nights on a house hunting trip. One of the nights happened to be NFL conference finals night so I wanted to get take out and watch the games instead of going out. I sent my husband out for the pasties and chicken wings.  He is a pretty conservative eater so he opted for the Oggie (traditional pasty) while I went for the Pilgrim (Thanksgiving style). The pasties were huge and still steaming hot when they arrived at the hotel room. The Pilgrim was served with the red wine gravy (delicious) and cranberry sauce. I thought the crust was as perfect as pasty crust could possibly be. Not too thick and braided along the edge. The filling was so moist and well composed. The meat wasn't dried out and the sweet potatoes really added flavor. My husband said he preferred my pastie to his.   I was not enamored with the tandoori chicken wings. They were caked in tandoori paste and soggy. I would not recommend these. They were also super spicy.  Since we are moving to the area, we will be coming back to try out the many varieties as well as the pasty dessert!",

    "text": "The food is fairly good, I just wish there were more choices instead of almost everything in a pasty.  I wish there was more protein in the dishes (they are very carb heavy).  There is not a lot of the meat in the pasties, it is about 25% meat with the rest potatoes/onions and then the crust on top of that.    They seem to run out of things quickly, they didn't have coffee/tea one evening.  Often something is missing off the plate (they run out and just don't say anything?).    The liver pate is good if you like pate but no red onion marmalade was included.  The wine gravy doesn't have that much flavor to it - very close to typical brown gravy taste.  Leek soup actually tastes mostly like a flour potato soup, no real flavor and thick with flour, though when a bite if leek is found it tastes good. Just not what I expected at all.  The Homemade Coleslaw was a nice surprise, it is a red cabbage warm with sweetness from apple vinegar.  They say Cornish Style but no description which means for most people they expect something close to typical coleslaw and get surprised (maybe pleasantly or unpleasantly depending on your sense of adventure).  Deserts are probably the best items, though the Banoffee Pie and Sticky Toffee Pudding were very sweet.  The chocolate pudding was not sweet at all and the flavor was very nice.  They serve a very small amount of fresh cream with some of the desserts (left off of one, maybe ran out that day) plus ice cream, it would be nicer to have more cream instead of non-premium vanilla ice cream.  They seem thrown if you ask for a change to the dish (e.g. could I have some milk for the black tea - isn't that typical British food and this is a British restaurant?, or if you don't want the bread with the soup - huge pieces of fairly nice but standard white fluffy bread).  They do the changes it is just they have a strong reaction to you asking as if nobody had ever asked for a change before.  Service is good overall, some servers seem to stand at the table and have long conversations with customers (the first time I thought he was a friend and had some free time so stood there for 10 minutes chatting about all kinds of topics, but I have seen each visit at tables close by, different servers each time).  This is a very casual restaurant, tables are stained and varnished picnic style tables with benches.  They are all larger so often you are sharing the table with others at the other end.  Whiskey bottles are used for candle stick holders.  It can get louder though it was not real loud and there was music in the background at least one visit (it was hard to tell if it was a performer somewhere not visible or CDs playing).",

The place is so unique and absolutely delicious so when my parents were in town I decided to take them to the Cornish Pastry on Guadalupe.  I bragged about how unique and delicious this place is. When we got there we were probably seated and greeted by our waitress who is very nice. However when it came time to order we all decided on different pastries so we could share and my parents could get an experience of this place.  When we went to place our order though the waitress kindly informed us that they were \"out of\" some of their most delicious pastries ( they were out of the pilgrim they were out of the roast dinner and the steak and pepper) we decided on other pastries, the Italian the chicken pot pie and the Cajun chicken. (Which were all great!). My complaint here is that it would have been nice when we were seated to have our waitress inform us of what they were out of right away instead of us getting amped up only to find out they were out of the favorites that I wanted them to try  All in all it was and okay experience drinks were delivered fast our waitress was kind I was just disappointed with not being told what was available to us to order I would have really liked them to try some of the best pastries there. O well I guess if I go back to the Guadalupe location I will have to call to make sure they have the pastries I want in stock before I go. Kind of a weird thing to do.",

    "text": "Like.  A lot. The pasty selection is practically endless. Oh man, I grew up eating this stuff in MI.  Went so long between having them so when we did it was a huge treat.  But their variety wasn't something I had even heard about in MI.  Here they create the traditional and turn it up a few notches with some of their own creations. And here they have a sauce on the side too.  It'a actually a gravy, with noticeable herbs and probably red wine too.  Its tasty stuff, but I think it actually takes away from the wonderful flavor of the pastie itself.  I really like the atmosphere here at this particular location. Granted I'm eating at the bar every time I've dined here so I'm not sure how I feel about the whole picnic table sort of seating which seems kind of communal. I really like the fact that you could come as a group and be together, as close as you want or as far apart as needed and still occupy just one table.    It just seems kind of rustic in here with architectural elements that appear to have been repurposed. It is dark, but not quite the envronment for an intimate dinner date. Something about low lighting and dark wood makes it appealing. Oh, and I can't forget to mention, they have expanded.  Like double inside from one of the last times we dined here. And the patio area did likewise.   This place must get crankin' Two thumbs up for \"well behaved canines\" being allowed on the patio.   Y'all know what that means, right?   And kuddos to the two young ladies who had their well mannered dogs with them today.    Beer selection is good.  I have always been able to get a draught that appeals to my palate.   And I am NOT talking Budweiser, Miller or Coors.  I don't even know if they have those options available.  I encourage you to come during the slow part of the day, sit at the bar where you can watch the food prep. You'll be entertained and educated about their pastie creations, and it might spark your interest to try something different next time.",

I ordered the Roast dinner pasty, rosemary chicken pasty, greek salad and sticky toffee pudding. Both of the pasties were lacking in depth, tasting of just one seasoning and salt. The vegetables in the roast were completely mushy and overwhelmed by the rutabaga mash. The brie was basically unnoticeable in the rosemary chicken. Neither dipping sauce was remarkable or complementary to the pasties. The greek salad was underwhelming, too much cheese and olives (I counted 15) in a small side salad. The sticky toffee pudding was basically overcooked ginger bread with no sticky toffee quality and not enough creme anglaise to go around (I accidentally also received ice cream of very cheap quality in my order).  Not only was the food mediocre, but the service was poor. I received dismissive directions to the togo area and was then rudely \"helped\" in finding it by another waitress who seemed to think I was trying to make a point about waiting to be helped instead of honesty not knowing this tiny spot next to a POS was the togo area. This place is just another \"trendy\" place to go, luring you in with the theme and ambiance. Don't be fooled. You're paying for the concept not the delivery.",

The day before our dinner, we got a call saying the room was overbooked and requesting we moved to the pews. We thought that would mean the pews would be ready. They weren't.  We wait over 20 minutes to be seated and further waited an hour to be served.  Considering we had reserved the room, i think we should have been offered an apology or appetizers or something. In addition, once the food did arrive it was cold. This place is nothing special. The waitress was in a bad mood too but i suspect this place doesn't have enough staff to accommodate how busy it is. (Don't worry i still tip 20% even with bad service because being a waitress is hard). I think the general public likes \"hype\" but i prefer tasty food with friendly service.",

The concept of being asked to specify sauce on an order not receiving it just screams a lack of attention to detail. I like this place and their food has overall been good, but I'm not sure I can return after such an oversight in their service and a lack of attention to detail for their online customers; and a gross lack of understanding when they ruin a patrons dinner. I was looking forward to stuffing my fat face with gravy and thousand island dressing, but you ruined my experience and expressed that you don't care.  Sincerely,  A Dissatisfied Customer",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that the food is absolutely incredible. It's a unique idea for the area and it's executed well. The atmosphere is very pub like, and I think could make an excellent casual date spot or a great place to meet up with friends.   So, why only 3 stars? The service. When I go out and I pay money for food and drinks, I'm paying a huge premium to be served. Unfortunately, this restaurant is lacking in that department.   We came for lunch and it was our first time there. We were told to sit anywhere, which was kind of awkward because they have a ton of long tables and we didn't want to annoy anyone by sitting at the other end of one that was occupied. If we had been seated there by a hostess, it would have been less awkward. We found a spot at an unoccupied table and were greeted quickly by our waiter. We ordered, which included 3 pasties, a side, and a salad, but were then told that they were out of lettuce. That was a huge let down. When the food came out we noticed we were missing the side dish we ordered, but by the time we were checked on, we were already more than halfway done, so it was pointless to ask for it when it obviously hadn't been put through to begin with. Our drinks went unfilled and there was way too much time between check ins, so we couldn't even ask for refills.  Admittedly, these issues weren't egregious by any means, but it greatly decreased satisfaction in our lunch experience. I know they are probably going for a laid back pub like experience, but they need to get better wait staff that can offer that experience but still be on top of things. It was slow at lunch, so I hate to imagine how awful it would have been during a dinner rush. I miiight try this place again because the food IS delicious, and if that experience is better then I will update this review.",

We walked in and we're sat right away, but as we were being seated we noticed how hot it was in the restaurant. It only got warmer as time went out and later we found out their AC was broken on one side of the building and they were still seating people in the side with no AC!   Then our server came over and didn't even greet us or tell us her name. She was very unfriendly and rude. She didn't pay attention to us at all and we ended up having to ask other servers walking by for things we needed. We also had a child with us and when we asked if they could make her a grilled cheese, they told us they wouldn't be able to make that for her and didn't offer us any options and we're just plain rude about it. Not a kid friendly place!!  We ordered fries to start, we had heard they were delicious, and they were very very disappointing. The fries weren't cooked all the way and very soggy. Then we asked for ranch and they brought us blue cheese. Finally our food arrived and that was the only decent part of this outing. The food was good but everything else was horrible. After we ate our pasties, our salads came out...very late and we no longer wanted them but still we're charged.   Then to finish off the night, our server brought us our check and as we handed it back to her she said, \"oh, I forgot to add your Diet Coke, let me do that.\" So she took our bill with our card and added the $2.50 soda. She was extremely rude.   Overall, the food is good, but the service is horrible and the place itself was so hot that we left sweating and very unhappy. As we left we ran into the manager who was made aware of some of the issues we had and he didn't seem to care...we will not return to this restaurant!!",

Kids we're getting impatient , I was getting impatient and my wife was growing disappointed. This is the place out of all the options in the East valley that she picked to have dinner on Mother's Day. Wait time was horrible.  The food was good, hot and freshly made.  Waiting for the check was easy, that was served very quickly!!! Waiting again for our server to grab my card and pay the bill became another disappointment. My wife finally grabbed the bill and card and went up to another server and request they run our card. We paid and left.  I was never t expecting to be compensated and was not by our server. The server that process ed our payment gave us a discount.  Not a great first impression. I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "It is really difficult to try things other than our favorites, but last night we had the Cornish meatballs app ($7.75), the Guinness Stew pasty ($10), and the Chicken Greek pasty ($9.75).  None of which we had ever had before.  Those meatballs are fantastic.  What a rich flavor.  I'm going to try to duplicate it.  They are like Swedish meatballs on steroids.  Highly recommend those.  The meatballs are bacon-wrapped.  What else do you need to know?  The Guinness stew pasty was stuffed full of everything you'd expect to find in a stew and had a rich, beefy flavor.  That one is comfort food for sure.  My husband had the Chicken Greek pasty and we enjoyed the flavors in that one as well, especially the kalamata olives.  Those always add something great.    I also tried the Founders special beer they had on tap, without asking too many details because I like their brews.  It was the Breakfast Stout and it's a good strong one, priced at $9.  It paired very well with the Guinness pasty.  He had his usual, the Rogue Hazelnut brown, and then we tried the Leffe Blonde Ale.  Someday I'm going to go to Belgium to meet the monks who make such great beer.  What a gig that must be.  That one was very different from what we had been drinking, but exceptional all the same.  Now I have an excuse to go to the liquor store and look for some to have at home.  All in we spent about $50.  Mica took great care of us at the bar.  Always look forward to Cornish Pasty Co.",

They have expanded a lot and the menu has many more items than in the \"old days.\"   While getting your food seems to take a bit longer than I remember, the quality remains high. I have never had anything here that I did not like, but I've also never had the lamb or salmon, so...   For first timers, I'd say you can't go wrong with the Oggie, Cajun Chicken, or anything on the dessert menu, but you're best served picking something that has a filling combination that sounds good to you. They even have a whole section of vegetarian pasties now!  Can't decide on ONE that you like? The pasties come out cut in half, which makes sharing awfully easy as long as you can get a friend to split with you.  Their beer list probably has something for everyone as well.",

I explained that these are a turnover type pastry outside stuffed full of all kinds of savory meats, cheese, veggies, or dessert fillings and then crimped and baked. They are common in the UK. I also told her this would not be a quick service since they wait until you order your pasty to bake it (comes to the table fresh and piping hot).  Parking is close to the door. The staff is awesome and was attentive the entire time we were there. There are booths, tables and chairs, indoor seating and outdoor seating. The interior has the look and feel of a British pub.   The pasties are in the $8-9.50 range. My friend had the Pilgrim (Roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing. Served with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce) and a soda. I had the BG Tips British Tea and the Spicy Asiago Chicken pasty (Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa). Totally delicious!  I really wanted to try the desserts, but the serving sizes are so large there was no way either of us could eat another bite. Someday I will have to stop by and have the BG Tips British tea and sample one of the desserts.",

What is preventing the 5 stars is the lighting and the wait staff. The lighting was so poor that my mother was unable to see where she was walking, caught the edge of platform for some couch seating and went tumbling forward, smacking face first into the hostess stand behind us. The hostess/ waitress was walking towards us and came up to our table with menus right after we righted my mother up but our neighbors and us where still asking if she was ok just dropped menus on the table and walked away without a word. So either the lighting is so bad the staff can't see if a patron trips and falls and hurts themselves 10-15 feet away, or they just don't care.  I'd still eat there again just next time i'm going to be that person wiping out the flashlight to walk to the table without and regard to the other patrons, for my safety and my families safety.",

First up, that was waaaayyyy more than enough food for two people (as it turned out we took most of the cottage pie pasty home).  The soup was real good.  I'd go back just to have that alone.  The cottage pie pasty (I at least took a bite before boxing it up) was also good.  The chicken pesto pasty was...ok.  The chicken, veggies and cheese we good.  The pesto was meh.  Beyond being meh there was way to much of it, which in turn really impacted the flavor of the pasty.  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't order this one again.  With the above being said, I still liked the place and will return to try other things.",

I had the salmon pasty. OMG! It was the best one I have tried. My other friends got the cheese steak and the pesto chicken. They were definitely not as good as the salmon. The salmon had this nice texture of being cooked perfectly well. Not too over cooked and not undercooked. The sauce that bathed this salmon was creamy, but unexpectedly, not too heavy. The only downside is, it is pretty dark there so I had a hard time seeing the menu and my food, but I guess that's part of the atmosphere. I definitely will go back here and definitely recommend this place if you have never eaten here.",

    "text": "Abridged: Meat. Cheese. Potatoes. In bread. Oh and Banoffee pie.  Unabridged: This is my favorite Pasty location. First off, there is tons of space. Tons. The decor also has a nice relaxing but slightly sophisticated feel. And there aren't a million ASU students prancing about and hardly ever a wait in line when we head there for lunch.   Vegetarian or not, there's always a pasty for everyone. Every time I've gone to either location, I've never gotten the same one twice, and I still have over 3/4 of the menu to clear off my list with most of them being ones I would love to enjoy. They're big enough that half the time I end up taking half home with me... though that's probably because I after trying the Banoffee Pie, I haven't been able to not order it since. So usually it's take half my pasty home and split Banoffee, which is the most heavenly dessert on the planet.   All the items are made there, and if you sit at the bar/kitchen area you can watch them making them right there in the restaurant. It's kinda fun really. Sometimes I watch a little too closely if I know they're making a favorite, trying to figure out how I can mimic this masterpiece at home. Alas, I've always ended up failing.   One thing to note is that while they make them there, they prep them in advance so you cannot substitute. However, I've been toying with the idea of calling a week in advance to have a special one made and paying up front so I can enjoy it a few days later.  So, back to this Banoffee Pie deal... I think I need to inform you in advance to save you from desperately trying to resist its allure when you visit due to this amazingly good review. So, it's a pretty awesome dessert. First, you start with a thick graham cracker crust. I am personally not a huge fan of graham cracker, but this isn't your typical crust like on a pie or a lemon bar. This looks like texas toast. For serious. Then add some homemade caramel, homemade whipped cream and bananas. This only adds up to a win.",

A friend and I had decided to check this place out, and absolutely fell in love. I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty: Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies and mexican stewed tomatoes, with a side of sour cream and salsa. If you want to add a lil more heat you can request some sriracha. They have a great selection of wine (I'm partial to their Malbec) and beers and their happy hour is killer.   The ambiance alone is pretty sweet as well. We sat at the bar, which is purely lit with candles. The tables are set with black church pews with candlight and dim lighting throughout. If it's a nice evening they have plenty of outdoor seating as well. Everyone that works there was soo chill and laid back. Made for a great evening !   Just hope next time I have enough room to try their dessert!",

    "text": "I have a friend who might as well live here, so when he suggested that we meet him I was curious to see why. As it turns out, it might be because of their alcohol options as opposed to their food options.   The soup options looked tasty, so I went for one while we waited for our friend to show. I ordered the leek soup. The soup itself was nearly a revalation, but I was not a fan of the bread. I love bread, so this was a little sad for me. The soup was creamy, had just the right amount of cheese, and somehow managed to not be overly leeky. Five stars on soup.  There was an impressive amount of beer options, according to my husband.  I ordered The Pilgrim. The dough was delicious, as was the turkey. I could have done without the large slices of onion and par-cooked yams (which didn't taste very \"Thanksgiving\" to me anyway). When I caught a bit of stuffing it made me very happy. I didn't like the gravy, but didn't need it anyway as the pasty was not dry. There was also a side of cranberry relish. I ate it all and took an additional cup home for my left overs (the soup was filling).  The second half of my pasty came home and spent the night in our fridge. It was far better having rested there for the evening. I was impressed with how much more I liked the pasty on day 2.  Four stars on pasty alone.  Seating indoors was strange, not suited for a couple having a dinner date, but ok for drinks. Seems as if though the bench-seating and dark atmosphere would be cool for pre-game drinking, perhaps with a large group of friends. It was slow when we were there, which I understand may be uncommon.",

I am seriously regretting getting put off!    At first we walked in and I felt sort of out of place, that faded quickly though.  I wish I had gotten the waitress's name because she was AWESOME, everyone was.  We sat near the cooks and it was great.  I checked out the porch seating and was impressed with the heating system they had out there, nice and warm on a very cool (for the valley) night.  The staff that were off for the night were eating and having drinks out on the porch and they were all so friendly!  We didn't have a single case of snobby or feeling ignored.  I got the Shepard's Pie (with the minted lamb).  It was great.  Perfectly made and the red wine sauce was great!  They didn't have any coconut rum so our waitress asked for a different drink order, in the end we decided to do a Long Island Ice Tea and adding pineapple juice since I originally wanted a Surfer on Acid, in short it was so good that I could have had 6 (and ended up on the floor) but been a very happy camper.  We also tried the Mushy Peas and Garlic Fries which were fantastic!  I will be going back ASAP!  I can't wait to take my Foodie Dad there!",

I give 5 Stars to any golden standard that I can always come back to or if it's one of those places that I'll take a friend to who's never been.  Somehow, this location in Mesa is better.  The Tempe location still deserves my full 5 Star-rating, but this one surpasses it.  It deserves maybe a 5 GOLD Stars or something like that.  My friend Chris came in from out of town and had a hotel room in Mesa.  I reserved a Zipcar, picked him up and this where we ate.  Everything was perfect.  I love the outdoor seating, I love the indoor seating, I love the decor and the food doesn't fuck around.  The taste doesn't tip-toe and pussyfoot around while you chew on it, it loads the flavor into a shotgun shells and fires it into you mouth and laughs at you when you're taken back by how delicious everything is.  I love taking friends to places like this because you get to see their over-the-top reaction to it as well.  It's like when you watch one of your favorite movies with a friend who's never seen it and you get to keep saying, \"Oh, this is the best part.\"  With the Cornish Pasty, it's the same thing, so many elements are the best part.

    "text": "I have spent some time in Cornwall and have eaten my fair share of pasties.  So I was excited to try this place out.  Right off the bat though, I love that they have so many vegetarian and vegan options.  That's really nice.  I tried the balsamic portobello mushroom pasty, the chips, and the chocolate bread and butter pudding.  Overall, it was good.  I would say that, aside from the chips, it's not as authentic as I would have hoped for.  The pasty itself was a bit more \"posh\" than what you'd normally find.  To be fair, I didn't do a direct comparison.  In Cornwall, I had previously eaten the more traditional pasties like cheese and onion, pork and apple, etc.  But I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth, as I said, I was very happy to have so many veggie options.  But the pasty did seem more posh in term of the pastry being more refined than what you'd normally see.  I mean, basically, the pasties they serve are actually probably better made and prepared than real pasties... the pastry is crisper but also a little tougher.  Overall, I like my pasty though.  The chocolate bread and butter pudding though, I'm afraid, was really not what I was expecting.  Real bread and butter pudding is made with chunks of bread and, you guessed it, soaked in butter (among other things).  What I was served was something more like a sponge cake soaked with brandy and comes with a little pot of creme anglaise (which I don't think I was ever served at any time in the UK, but hey ho!).  The sponge cake has more of a consistency of treacle tart/pudding.  Minus the treacle, of course.  And again, it tasted really nice and was a lovely dessert in it's own right, it was just not bread and butter pudding.  It looked like a striped cube, by the way.  So I guess for the food that's my review, that the food was very good in it's own right, and possibly is a posh version of those foods, but I didn't get that authentic homey feel from it like I hoped because it wasn't the real thing.  I would definitely go there again though.  The service was really good.  I liked the vibe of the place and the decor is cool.  And the food was tasty overall.  It's a nice, casual, fun restaurant.",

The restaurant itself is extremely laid back and comfortable, and set up very differently than any other restaurant I've ever been to. Instead of tables, they have pews with long tables in between and candles made from bottles on every table. My friends and I were seated immediately, and the server, Mike, got our drink orders quickly.   Once my friends and I decided what we wanted, we waited maybe 10-20 minutes for our food to arrive. I ordered the Philly Pasty, which had meat, Swiss cheese, peppers, and onions in it. The food, once it was ready, took about five minutes to get to our table. The crust of the pasty was amazing: golden and crunchy, perfect. The stuffing, on the other hand was a different story. The stuffing was lukewarm; I wasn't impressed with the temperature. It was still delicious, but it definitely could have been warmer. The food was served on metal plates and the drinks were served in huge, heavy glasses. I felt like I was back in time, to be honest.   Our server, Mike, checked on us regularly, but he was listening to his iPod and eating on the job... that didn't inspire much confidence for this particular dining experience. He was also doing dishes intermittently, which is acceptable but at the same time it just struck me as odd that he was doing them instead of waiting his tables.  All in all, it was a positive dining experience, and I would definitely go back to that Cornish Pasty Co. location. Next time, I would just make sure my food was warm when it reached the table.",

Whats with that?Place has a nice ambience but can be rather claustrophobic, service is good somtimes, and absolutley terrible on other occasions. Some of the pasties are not as good as they sound and can be quite dry.  Be careful when ordering.  The original classic pasty is always a good bet. Good yet short happy hour & a creative atlternative to the average corner pub. Could be better, could be 5 stars!",

At this place the staff is always great to the kids, and the food is always excellent.  I love the booths outside, which provide enough privacy (just in case the kids get a little bit loud) but still let you enjoy the sunlight.  We've been there about 5 times in the last 1.5 months and there's been only one pasty that wasn't excellent, can't recall which one.  I'm not a big fan of the side dishes, I'd recommend passing on them and just having pastys.  And the service is a little bit slow, but I understand how the food is made, so I just go ready to hang out and relax.  If the kids are having a bad day, we pass.",

I also enjoy picking up the ones you can finish baking at home. Drink prices are always good and they normally have specials going. My favourite is the Shepherd's Pie or the Bangers and Mash.

So for those who are too scared of the pastys or don't see something they like or just want to check out something else on their menu...I must say, try the artichoke, bowtie pasta salad!! Its amazing! The dressing is great, as well as the spinach, pasta and feta! I have tried to replicate this at home..no success. So if you aren't the pasty type, try the salad!!",

The third bite was cold.  Not just cold but soggy mush cold. Some food can be eaten cold.  Pizza, Fried Chicked.  This just flat out turns you off and ruins your taste buds.  The staff after 10 minutes of trying to get them away from staring at their cell phones and the group conversation at the bar.  They blankly look at you and say,  \"do you want us to heat it up?\"  We were turned off. Its like reheating leftovers.  THey sent a couple home with us and we paid for our beer.  Been to several pasty places. I love them! They keep them in the oven with a much smaller choice range. So when you get they are baked throught out, hot and feel like a meat pie should taste.

I ordered the Rosemary Chicken pasty and was pretty disappointed with the taste and quality of the item.  I would avoid it.  The chicken was low grade and the unappealing slimy texture of the items inside the pasty made it appear to be not fresh, like a glorified hot-pocket.  I did not like the choice in flavor of the cheese with the rosemary, and it was all rather bland.  My dinner party ordered the Pavlova desert, and it wasn't something I would order.  They all love that desert, but I found it very unappealing.  Lots of sugarless bland whipped cream, some fruit, and the meringue texture was just weird to me, but I have no idea if that's how the Pavlova is traditionally made.  Considering my first experience at a different location being good, I would try something else on the menu and avoid the Rosemary Chicken and Pavlova.  I personally wouldn't be quick to pick this place for dinner.  Our service was fine.",

Cute place, good service.  My only issue was that it was rather loud and difficult to hear each other..",

    "text": "I went to the Cornish Pasty Company for the first time today on recommendation from a friend who loves the restaurant.    I ordered the \"Mexican\" which was absolutely delicious.  The spices, steak, potatoes, cheese were all perfectly balanced.  The pasty came with a side of salsa and sour cream, but the pasty was just perfect as is.  No salsa or sour cream needed.    My husband ordered the pesto chicken.  It was pretty good.  I sampled his item and he ate part of mine.  His was pretty good, but we both agreed that the Mexican was the best.  Like with the Mexican, the pasty came with marinara sauce.  I tried it, but it overwhelmed the wonderful flavor of the chicken and pesto.  Plus, the marinara sauce and the salsa both tasted like they came out of a jar, so to put them on a pasty seemed not right at all.    We also ordered the garlic oven chips (fries)--first mistake!  I LOVE garlic and add it in just about everything I eat.  The fries were just too overwhelming with salt and garlic.  We could not eat them.  We took them home to our teenagers, who eat anything, and they agreed that they were too salty and had too much garlic.  I am quite certain, based on my friend's review, that my fries/chips were accidentally dosed with extra garlic.  She claims they were the best, but mine were not edible.    After trying the fries, I did not like the mashed potatoes either which tasted like they had too much garlic.  They probably didn't, but it was hard to get the garlic flavor out of my mouth.  I sampled the potatoes within 5 minutes of them arriving, and they were just warm.  The cheese on top had already hardened.  I think that definitely took away from the potatoes.  Like with the fries, we brought the potatoes home, and the teens ate them no problem and claimed that they did not have too much garlic.    As for us adults, we will definitely order a pasty or two again.  I will probably try the garlic chips again just because my friend can't be wrong.... and maybe those potatoes too.  Hopefully they will come out with melted, gooey cheese next time.",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty Co is one of our favorite restaurants... in fact, the one reason we don't eat there on a weekly basis is that everyone else knows how good it is and it can get PACKED.    I always get the same meal because it's perfect: Hibiscus Iced Tea (addictively good) and Shepard's Pie.  Lamb, carrots, peas, onions, mashed potatoes, cheese - all in a flaky crust.  Ultimate comfort food!  BF loves the Chicken Greek, Spicy Asiago, the Pepper Steak, and pretty much every other pasty he's tried.    It can be slow but the atmosphere makes the wait a bit easier because you can ALWAYS people watch.  There is a wait while the pastys cook so if you're starving, go with the soup - their soups are very good and come out fast.  We haven't had many of the desserts but the banoffee pie and the caramel apple pasty are both solid.  Can't speak much about the bar side, either, but BF does love that they serve Strongbow cider.  If you haven't gone before, you'd better go soon - used to be a hidden gem but now we have to worry about getting a table!",

We split an order of chips, but it turns out they weren't needed.  Teenage son was full after 1/2 of his pasty, and that almost never happens.  Both pasties were delicious and flavorful, and filling without being heavy.  The chips were about the best we've ever had.  The waitress was pleasant, helpful and kept our water glasses filled.

I had the spicy chicken with black beans, asiago cheese, corn & tomatoes.  My husband had meat & cheese, and my kids had the Royale, chicken pot pie & the Pilgrim.  Each one was perfectly done.  We ordered two desserts, and to be honest, we didn't love either one.  The chocolate bread pudding was too strong of a brandy flavor for me, and the other one - some graham cracker Carmel banana thing - was too heavy on the whipped cream with not enough Carmel.  But the beer list was good & the atmosphere was fun, so I'm giving a 5 star anyhow. Now we just need one of these places in San Diego!",

I believe the description went something like this: \"I won't lie to you, it's basically fancy hot pockets. But they're really good, unique, and fresh.\" We took his word and we're glad. Flavors came through very well in the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I had the Italian pasty... A variety of meats, cheese, and tomatoes with marinara to dip into. When I was finished I was full but still wanted more. A wide variety of beer was also present.  There were two downfalls in my mind. The first was that the main source of light was a candle at each table. I would have enjoyed seeing our tablemates a bit better as well as my food. The second was the \"no removal of ingredients\" aspect, although I wasn't looking to exclude any of the ingredients from my specific pasty. The pasties are made in large batches and then refrigerated until they are cooked. Items are in large chunks, though, so if I wanted to remove tomatoes on my own I could have (with more light, of course).  If you're looking for a different type of meal in the area, stop in!",
