After coming here for the Yelp event, I knew I would be back, but I wasn't sure that it would be consistently good (I would guess a restaurant would try to be top notch for an event). That being said, this was just as good as the first time on our second trip. We went on a beautiful Phoenix winter day (70's and partly cloudy...ahhh) and sat on their lovely patio. We got the chips (which they had run out of at the event) and they were pretty amazingly delicious. They are crispy, but not too crispy and the sauce pairs with them perfectly. Additionally, I got a side of their wonderful and amazing jalapeno sauce....so good on just about everything....especially the chips. YUM! We also each got a Paris Texas burger....very tasty stuff. I like that they make their prosciutto crispy....I have never had it that way, and it is wonderful. The food here is pretty substantial too, ate it for a late lunch and was too full to eat again all night. I would say that this place doesn't have my favorite burger in town, but it is in my top 3. I definitely will be back.",

Kind of shredded chicken with grapes and some celery and raisins and mayo. Yum! Had an old fashioned quality taste. Loved the sangria too!

A friend of mine turned me onto a burger from Ingos the other day, it smelled so good when he got in the car that I just had to take a bite right away. When I opened the container, not only was the burger picture perfect but its made with grass fed beef & the taste was so delicious that I didn't want to put it away & wait until I got home to finish the rest. It was so juicy but not greasy at all. The potatoes that came with it are somewhere between a chip & a French fry, and also super tasty. This is definitely my new favorite burger joint, even though the parking lot is very small & kind of hard to park, its worth it even if I have to park down the street & walk there. I can't wait to try other items off the menu too.",

Their menu is small, yet they have unique entrees that will still make difficult to pick one.  Sitting is very limited as it's small location, but everyone is usually in-and-out due to the quick service. The only thing that I'm not the biggest fan of is their fries. Well they aren't even fries, they are chips. I want real fries, and I want ranch to dip them in. I know it sounds obnoxious, but there is nothing like having some thick cut fries with your burger. Besides that, the burgers are amazing. For all you vegans, make sure you get the black bean burger, but ASK for it on an English muffin as the regular bun is not vegan. Staff is really friendly. Make sure you plan ahead as parking can be tricky and time consuming.",

    "text": "This is exactly what this corner needed, a cute little eatery for locals to enjoy, but I have a love hate feeling right now.  I was excited to hop up to the counter, but unfortunately the chairs do not move back and are too close to the counter and I slammed my knee pretty hard into counter wall while trying to sit at the counter, yep these seats were not made for those who are 6ft or taller, not comfortable at all, so I moved outside.  Good thing they have heaters, or this night would have been a flop.  Once we were seated outside, we were handed menu's, everything looks interesting.  To drink I had the coonawarra tea, which came in a cute little bottle with a glass & some ice.  I'm not even sure what coonawarra tea is, but it was good, I enjoyed it, the bottle rendered about 2  1/2 glasses, and I'm unsure if it is refillable bottle after that.  I ordered a side of shattered potato chips that comes with some sort of lemon spread dipping sauce, I was perplexed then as I am now, I can't honestly tell you if I liked them or if I didn't.  The shattered potato chips are fresh chips, but some are not chips just thick slices of potatoes, which this Irish girl loved and some were thinly sliced potatoes, I guess that's how they are shattered chips right? The chips were garnished with salt & pepper too. The lemon spread/dipping sauce that came with it, well that was unique, not sure if I liked it with the potatoes or not, but didn't stop trying it. haha. So conflicted I tell ya.  Also ordered the Paris Texas Burger, it was a Strauss family grass feed beef patty with apple bbq sauce, La Quercia pancetta, sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato & dill pickle.  Now I loved this burger, the sharp contrast of flavors between the cheddar & pancetta and dill pickle just made this burger pop! I would for sure come back just for that burger!   They do have a walk up window so you can order your food to go, which is something I will consider next time.  It's a cute place, service is extremely friendly and the burger was delish!",

    "text": "Ingo's is a neat little spot, with an interesting concept.  I agree with Lindsey H. who called it a 'gourmet concession stand'.  The inside only seats about 12 people, but there is lots of outdoor seating!  The menu is also quite basic and small, but you can tell the main focus is on the ingredients.  You can get any burger Adam and Eve style (naked- with lettuce), on a LGO English muffin, or on one of there homemade hamburger buns.  I went with great company, Jon and Amy, so we each got a burger in a different style, of course Jon went naked :P   Amy had the burger with sauerkraut (Ingo Burger), I think we all agree that was the best burger and quite unique with great flavors.  Amy said, \"This is the best burger I have had in a long time!\"  Jon and I were a bit jealous.  We both opted for their version of a bacon cheddar burger (Paris-Texas Burger), which had Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese (for the record I LOVE this cheese), a homemade sweet barbecue sauce, and crispy pancetta.  It was quite good, but I have had better bacon-burgers in my day.  I also found the barbecue sauce to be a bit sweet for my liking.  Jon and I still devoured every last morsel, so I am not really complaining as it was good food.    The menu was lacking side dish options and salads.  We had the spiced up potato chips that are made in house and comes with their version of a sour cream dip.  It was good comfort food, but very fried.  The only salad on the menu is a quinoa and kale salad, so if you don't like that 'stuff' you are SOL.  This is not a bar, but it is also worth noting the beer and wine options are limited...but they are only $3 during happy hour, which we managed to make by 7min (ends at 6pm).    Last but not least, our amazing server told us about their ice cream sandwich dessert with Belgium chocolate and peanut-butter!!!  If I wasn't stuffed and heading to the gym right after eating I would have been all over that!! I will be back to try that for sure, but I would come back in general anyway :)",

If you are the kind of people who love to try different things, smaller plates to experience a few tastes, this is your kind of place.  Their bread is baked right across the street and so are the cookies.    Don't miss: The little burgers are excellent, these little tasty buggers pack a punch of flavor and so do the homemade chips...  The Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookies are worth buying, they tempt you with a free sample at the end of your meal.  Tips: Don't go for the big dishes, try a few things a la carte when you are there, follow your meal with the coffee from La Grande Orange across the way, their parent company.",

    "text": "Last two experiences I've had at Ingo's  1) ordered curb side waited the ten minutes, went to pick up food, sat there for 15 minutes, decided to get out and see what's up, the guy that was taking to the person in the car next to me for the last ten minutes says \"oh, I didn't know this was yours, it's been ready for a while\".... I was in a hurry so I was mad, rightfully. I ordered from Ingo's this day for the curbside experience and didn't even have time to eat.   2) just now, order my go-to, better curbside experience, chicken is too dry to eat.   I WAS eating here three times a week (see my previous review ... 4 stars) but lately there has been no attention to detail and the food is either too salty or I guess now, over cooked.    Moving on.  Old review......  My husband and I just moved down the street from Ingo's and eat here often. It's really good, when it's really good. But sometimes it's entirely too salty.   He loves the fried chicken sandwich and I'm obsessed with their kale salad. I go back and forth on the fish, burger patty and the chicken.   I recommend the chicken but ask for light salt!   They also have an option for a grass-fed patty which is a really nice touch.",

We love the crispy chicken sandwich & the kale, quinoa salad + crispy chicken - seriously, it's the best! They just started serving breakfast so we had to try it. We indulged ourselves by trying the cinnamon rolls (baked to order perfection), the english muffin with yummy preserves and the chorizo burrito, dipped in their jalapeno hot sauce, is what dreams are made of. Our hearts and stomachs are always so happy at Ingos!",

This casual dog-friendly patio hangout, right across the street from its parent restaurant La Grande Orange (or, LGO) offers the same high quality eats. Although Ingo's menu is small, each item is chock-full of fresh ingredients and flavor. I really like the black bean burger; in all honesty, it is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had anywhere. The kale and quinoa salad is also yummy and full of good-for-you ingredients that makes you feel like you did your body a favor. The deviled eggs and shattered potato chips (very similar to really thick potato chips) are delicious. I usually order 2 of each. Ingo's is a la carte and each menu item will cost you between $7-9 (except for the deviled eggs and shattered potato chips, both of which are considered appetizers and are both under $5).  Check out Ingo's and try some tasty food. :)",

Shattered potatoes, with a Mediterranean dipping sauce, and lastly some delectable cookies to wrap the meal.   Not only the food, but the service too was outstanding.

I was expecting a burger place, but it was not nearly as focused on burgers as I thought it would be from hearing about it.  I think there were a few options in that department    The building's atmosphere is super cool and unique, which felt right in place across from Postino and LGO at 40th and Campbell.  We (5 dudes) sat at the counter inside in a linear fashion and it was a bit cramped, but not so bad that it ruined the experience - we moved on from the topic in a mere 10 seconds.    I ordered the gourmet burger with Pancetta, medium-rare, along with a side of their \"chips\".  To me, fries are just as important as the burger, but \"chips\" were the option.  They need to come up with another name for this offering, because the words \"chips\" sells them very short!  They're more fry than chip, but I'm glad I ordered anyway.  The only suggestion I would make is a smaller portion option, so one can get out with a little cheaper lunch tab, and not gorge themselves on spuds!  The burger arrived and it was amazing - nothing really else to discuss on the topic.  Enough said - Ingo's is a winner!",

The set up is a little unusual with the order window towards the back of the venue, but I like the seating layout a lot. It's fun to sit outside and soak up some sun or lounge in the shade with a brew and some taters.  The food itself was fabulous. The crushed potatoes with labne were extremely tasty - even more so than I had imagined with the wonderfully distinct dip. I thought it was going to taste like any other sour cream or ranch dip, but it was something beautiful in its own right. I enjoyed the tuna burger - the burger itself was pretty good with plenty of avocado a soft spice. I added extra with their homemade fermented jalapeno sauce (totally awesome!). The buns were remarkable with just enough softness to not be mush when you bite. My companion tried the Ingo burger and reported the bun to be a slightly mushy with the saurkraut and mustard sauce dripping on it.  The service was friendly and timely. But the only reason I'm docking a star  is because they've removed the veggie burger. LGO's veggie burger has been my FAVORITE in the valley. I tried ordering it at LGO itself about a week prior to visiting Ingo and was told they no longer have it at the pizzeria, because it's on the Ingo menu. When I ask for it at Ingo, they've taken it off the menu... Do I want a rice bowl? F*&% no I don't want a rice bowl at a burger joint. Please bring my veggie back.",

    "text": "I visited Ingo's this weekend (twice) and have to say they now have a little place in my heart. I absolutely love this little neighborhood joint.  On Saturday I stopped in on a whim and sat at the indoor counter solo. I ordered the tuna burger- wasn't a fan so I then ordered a cheeseburger. The tuna burger was interesting but the texture was odd. Why still 5 stars? Because the grass-fed beef burger was heaven in a bun! I'm talking melt in your mouth deliciousness! I kind of wanted dessert and Laura (I believe she's the manager) talked me into the ice cream sandwich. She told me it would change my life. Well she wasn't joking this salted Carmel ice cream sandwich gave me life!! It has sugar cookies on each side and I was told they add more cream cheese and butter to the cookies so they don't fully freeze. I'm sure that means more calories, but who cares it's totally worth it!  Well I was so impressed that I brought my friend in on Sunday and we sat outside. Let me point out that we received full service outside after we seated ourselves- we did not order from the window. I got the crispy chicken sandwich this time and O...M...G!!! It's even better than the burger I would have rated 5 stars!!! How did this happen?! It had apples, pickle and a sriracha mayo on it. It sounds odd, but take my word for it finding a chicken sandwich better than this will for sure be difficult! I also enjoyed the shattered potato chips. They come with a dipping sauce- no idea what it is but it's pretty good. They also have this house-made jalapeno hot sauce that is awesome on the potatoes and has a nice clean fiery kick! If you like spicy food be sure to ask for it as it's not something that automatically comes with your order.  Lastly, another reason they get 5 stars is because the service is amazing! I had conversations with Dom the executive chef and Laura and both were so extremely friendly and welcoming. Along with the friendliness, there's also some serious eye candy working in there which is never a bad thing! ;)",

We had the \"No.1 Tuna Burger,\" \"Shredded Kale and Quinoa Salad,\" and the \"Fresh Shattered Potato Chips.\"  The No.1 Tuna Burger consists of super grade tuna and bulgur wheat, spicy aioli, and avocado. So delicious. The Shredded Kale and Quinoa salad includes sunflower seeds, grapes, red pepper, parmesan and manchego. It was okay. Wasn't that impressed with it to be honest. It lacked a savory element and I didn't like the grapes but it's very refreshing as a side.  The shredded potato chips were really good with the Lebni side sauce.  The atmosphere is interesting. It's like a family oriented bar. I sat next to a family with a baby while upbeat dance music played at a medium volume that allowed for conversation. I'm really excited to know this restaurant exists because it's a cool restaurant/bar with great food. I'll be back again soon.",

The lemonade comes in a cup with finger imprints (for the clumsy, this is a plus.  It doesn't slip out of my hands!)  The menu is short and sweet and may not appease or appeal to all, but this girl who will jump at the sight of a grass fed burger cooked perfectly with delicious chips on the side is happy.

So this time I added an angus burger as protein to the salad. So good. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. (I've had their burgers in the past and they are really good, worth a visit specifically for the burger). If you've never had the LGO group signature salad, it's got quinoa, dinosaur kale, grapes, sunflower seeds, and cheese (I want to say manchego) with lemon zest and a teensy bit of olive oil. It's so good, I crave it. Adding the burger to it was deeeeeelightful.  The hub had their crispy chicken Sammy. He loved the fresh bun and the lightly battered and fried chicken. They thinly sliced Granny Smiths on there, pickles (which the hubs removed), and a nice Sriracha aioli. He will be back for this.  We also ordered the shattered potato chips which live halfway between French fries and potato chips. Deep fried, out piping hot with a onion dip variation and salsa verde. So good. So naughty.  The kiddo \"enjoyed\" an excellent kids grilled cheese. She's just not a big eater but I tried it and it's a great grilled cheese. A nice hearty bread which is probably why she had a hard time with it. Comes with a couple shattered potato chips and a carrot. Of course she gobbles down the garnish. I do have to say that her lemonade was phenomenal. So fresh, tart, and perfectly sweet.   Good spot with happy hour from 11-7 M-F. Fair warning, if you order a sandwich, you get just a sandwich, albeit delicious, but there won't be a side with it unless you order it in addition.",

We loved the atmosphere, the restaurant theme, the service and the food!   I had white sangria of course and I also had kale and quinoa salad for lunch, it was yummy but I would recommend the chef to add raisins for the balance.  My hubby had bean burger and he said it was yummy as well. My brother and sister in law had the grass fed beef burger and they said it was amazing.  We shared the home-made potato chips and devil eggs, oh boy it was great. We loved everything, but my #1 fav was home-made potato chips with some short of white deep and the green salsa deep was a dope!   Larissa our waitress was so sweet, she gave us chocolate chip cookies with French sea salt as dessert compliment, it was amazing! We also had vanilla and chocolate swirled gelato, it was so smooth like silk melting in your mouth.  Thank you for your service Ingo's tasty food, you have the most friendly staffs ever!",

    "text": "Ingo's is a hip little patio restaurant that, like Chelsea's Kitchen, falls under the La Grande Orange umbrella. It offers a pretty straight-forward menu that isn't overly complicated. Bar seating inside and patio dining on the outside.   We've been here multiple times and always get the shattered potato chips as a starter. Although, as most reviewers will point out, they're not really chips, but slices of a potato. The lebni addition is a nice touch, although if there is sea salt incorporated, I certainly couldn't taste it. I feel they would have benefited from a little sprinkle of salt and ketchup on the side, which I'm pretty sure Ingo's sees as the equivalent of poison based on its limited availability. I will have my girlfriend smuggle some in her purse on her next visit and hope that we won't be banned for doing so.  The burgers here are on par with what you'd get at most of the gourmet burger places in Phoenix. We've ordered both the Ingo Cheeseburger and Paris, Texas Burger. I recommend opting for the LGO English Muffin instead of the traditional bun, which is what currently sets them apart (at least until Diablo Burger opens up). Any Ingo Cheeseburger can be further enhanced with the addition of a fried egg. They're good, but not quite in the same league as the LGO Burger served next door, which is a whole other experience.  They used to offer ice cream sandwiches for dessert here when they first opened. Those have since been eliminated. You can still get miniature versions of their sea salt cookie. Sometimes the server will give you one or sometimes you just have to go inside and take one. Being a True heel, I took two for myself. Just don't tell anyone.  Overall, I like Ingo's for a quick dinner. I feel it's worth the occasional visit, but it's kind of hard to choose eating here when it's placed right next to its superior big brother in LGO.",

At the beginning of the meal, I informed the waitress that I had Celiacs Disease, and asked if the items I selected were gluten free. She assured me thy were fine.   They brought out the chips, which I began eating. About 5 minutes after bringing out the chips, the waitress comes by and says, \"You didn't eat any of those yet, did you? They're not gluten free.\"   The meal made me horribly ill, the manager never came by to apologize, and the waitress provided a very halfhearted, \"Oh, sorry. You didn't eat a lot of them, though, right?\" The lack of awareness of food allergies, I believe, makes this an unsafe place for people suffering from said allergies to eat.",

    "text": "My hiking partner strikes again, as during our 2nd descent down Piestewa today, she asked some guys around us for a hamburger restaurant rico.  \"Ingo's\" they shot back!  It's a round, quaint little place, slightly reminiscent of the old Woolworth lunch counter style dining.  If there's a free seat, take it, or stand on top of the printed footsteps located behind each position at the counter  We had a waitress in training, and both she and her trainer were pleasant and charming, full of recommendations and suggestions.  The Paris, Texas burger caught my fancy, and I requested it with the BBQ sauce on the side, topped with a fried egg.  It arrived with a darling heart tipped toothpick which held the condiments in place.  The burger was delicious and juicy, with a light and airy bun, crisp bacon, and this amazing fermented jalapeno sauce.  I actually tossed back a shooter of one.  And the \"potato chips\" were thin cut, french fried potato rings, crispy on the outside, creamy inside.  And when customers were all paid up, they hit the \"cookie jar\" before bouncing, as there were fresh made cookies, free for the taking.  I can imagine this place gets crazy busy, as the food is so good I tried to talk Yuko into splitting another burger with me... its worth the wait!",

A quick glance on Yelp reviews, I wanted to try all. They all look so tasty. I ended up trying a cheeseburger. Added $1 to grass fed beef and ordered my burger medium rare. First bite of my burger, I tasted a soft bread and very good meat blended perfectly. It was a bit small for my appetite, I was still hungry after I finished eating.  I also liked yogurt base dip for their shattered potato chips. Deep fried potato went well with this dip as well as fermented jalapeno peppers sauce. I added sauce to my burger too.  Really liked the ambiance. This place is set up to cater only small group at a time. I like their round shape counter. In a warm day, I would like to come back to enjoy my meals on their patio.  They are so close to both Camelback and Piestewa peak hike. Perfect place to eat after good hike.   I would like to come back and eventually try all on the menu.",

    "text": "Ingo's runs with the major players in the heart of the most infamous burger-trap hood around. From the platinum shine to the grill, you'd never know that underneath all that flash, Ingo's ain't packin' heat.   Food-wise, I mean... The cold double stack of gritty, unmelted orange cheddar on 3/3 burgers (veggie, Paris Texas, & kids' meal status) was peeled off. The famous english muffin was dry (WHAT THIS IS, LGO COME ON) but not toasty or warm, and the regular bun was even more forgettable. It was reported as \"way too mushy\" by a high schooler who ordered meat & cheese on bread. This should not be a recipe for mushiness (nor should it be a recipe at all... but I digress.) What could've used a little less heat: any part of the patio lacking shade.    The remaining patio, however, is the beez kneez. We table-hopped to safety and enjoyed the beautiful weather to the sounds of rasta-hip-hop blaring from overhead, further enhancing our summer-in-February vibes with reasonably tasty mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches. The only element more impressive was the thumb-indented water cups... the ultimate drinking experience. Surrounded by puppies and gentle Arcadians, I thought, \"patio game strong,\" though I can't say the same for the food experience.    A player must stay on their grind in these parts, and with so much competition less than a bun's throw away, Ingo's shade isn't enough to pull me away from the streets.",

I like that they offer a variety of food choices with healthy options too. There is outside seating and bar seating inside where you can sit and watch the chefs and staff go to work! I've always enjoyed being able to be a part of the action and see what goes in to making the wonderful dishes before they're served to customers. I have been here 4 times and thought it was time to write a well thought out review. I can't get enough of the Fresh Shattered Potato Chips, the Ingo Burger, and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich that has the perfect amount of spice to it. Overall, the food and service is great for anyone to enjoy in a casual relaxed environment.  I honestly would've given this place a 4+ star rating if it weren't for my MAJOR concern listed below.  My one and only MAJOR concern that has been consistent all 4 times I have eating here is that the executive chef who checks the food before it goes out repeatedly failed to wear gloves to avoid cross contamination. I watched him poke and touch customer's food with his bare hands then text on his phone, make phone calls on his cell phone, and type on his computer repeatedly each time I have eaten here. Not once did I witness him leave to wash his hands. I was VERY lucky that he didn't poke my burger any of the times I was sitting there watching him in disbelief, otherwise I would've sent it back immediately! Maybe he didn't because he knew it was my food and I was watching him, but either way it completely grossed me out!",

We were greeted by a very kind staff and told to choose any seat, no wait at 8:00pm and they were just putting out candles on the tables outside! It was romantic, great music playing and our server came over right away! We started with the \"potato chips\" which are a delicious crispy mix between French fries and chips! It's served with their delicious homemade Greek yogurt sauce and hot sauce. Trust me, start with this is so good and perfect to share between two! The food menu is small but packed with unique flavors! I tried the chicken sandwich --it was nice and piping hot and super crispy! The sauce and apple combination with the sandwich are unbelievably good! My boyfriend has the fish sandwich \"Adam and Eve\" style (lettuce instead of bun)! I love bread but the fish sandwich was yummy with the lettuce--it didn't feel like you were missing out on the bread! Great atmosphere GREAT FOOD, amazing service! We'll be back for happy hour and dinner SOON! :)",

The volume of the music along with the open kitchen setting made for a loud environment.  This last time I had the Ingo Cheeseburger and we shared the shattered potato chips.  The potato chips were thick and quite good with a crunchy border and soft middle.  The dipping sauce was okay.  The cheeseburger though was very oily - I assume from the mayonnaise.  It was so oily it coated the inside of my mouth and overwhelmed the burger in general.  The meat of the burger was so soft it was almost like eating mashed potatoes.  Between that and the oil,  it was unlike any burger I've had and I did not enjoy it.  It's my understanding that this restaurant is run by the same folks who operate chelsea's kitchen.  I love their hamburgers so this was a big dissapointment.",

First and most importantly, the food just wasn't as good as I had expected. We ordered a fish sandwich and a burger and split them. We also tried the chips and lebni appetizer. The hot sauce/ salsa served with the chips was awesome, way better than the lebni. I didn't enjoy the lebni at all, it was so lemony, but maybe that's what lebni is supposed to taste like? I'm not sure. The burger wasn't good at all. While it was juicy, it didn't taste seasoned. It tastes like plain hamburger meat which wasn't appetizing to me at all. The bun was delicious, which was a nice surprise. It was soft and fluffy with poppy seeds on top. The fish sandwich had a large batter coating with little fish. The fish that was there was pretty strong. It didn't taste fresh. On top of it all there were flies buzzing around inside landing on us and our food which was super annoying. The manager saw us batting at the flies and didn't try to take care of them. The service wasn't great either, we had to ask for everything: napkins, refills, check, etc. however they were friendly, just not attentive.",

Perfectly sliced potatoes with an amazing sour cream / dill dip which was lip-smacking good. For dinner I had the chicken Sammy and shared the kale/quinoa salad with my amigas.   The chicken Sammy was a fried chicken sandwich with a zippy sauce that was so flavorful. As for the kale salad, I hesitated a bit because I'm not one to enjoy kale (I hope to get there in my life). This salad was amazing!!!!! There were grapes in the salad which gave it a sweet something something. I need to figure out how to copy this salad because it's packed with superfoods.   For dessert we had the salted caramel ice cream sandwich which was sooooo good!! And to mention, if you don't get dessert go hit up their free 99 cookie table.   Definitely check out this restaurant for a fresh twist on american food.",

My boyfriend and I arrived around 1 pm on a Saturday and immediately found seating at the bar, which is awesome because it is essentially \"in\" the kitchen. We ordered deviled eggs to start and were impressed by their size and creamy filling. For the price, I wish they would add another piece to the serving, but after getting so much other good food, it was not an issue.  I immediately fell in love with the idea of getting the tuna burger, but due to shipment issues and the morning rush, they were out. The boyfriend and I decided on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the Paris, Texas Burger and our server talked us into a side of chips.  The sandwiches came out pre-split (which is ideal as my bf and I love to share) and the chips were just as delicious as promised (they use baked potatoes, which gives the chips an awesome texture and flavor)! Our server also hooked us up with a salted caramel Gelato sandwich to make up for the lack of tuna sandwich, which was very yummy too!  Overall, we had a great experience with delicious food and conscientious service. Next time (which I hope is very soon!!), I want to try the egg salad (weekends only, looks amazing and innovative) and the tuna sandwich. Keep up the good work Ingo's!",

We had a great time sitting out on the patio drinking and enjoying the gorgeous weather and delicious food via candlelight.

I ordered the chips to start, (thick potato slices) with a wonderful aioli dipping  sauce amongst a few others. I also ordered the cheeseburger. I was pleasantly  surprised of how well the burger was seasoned. I also added that aioli sauce on the burger which made it even better.   My boyfriend however was underwhelmed with the duchess (French dip) sandwich.  It was very plain and didn't include cheese onion or anything. Just sliced cooked beef.   Other then that, the rest was good and I'd come back!",

I had the Farmer's daughter and my husband had his favorite the Paris Texas at least before today. They have changed the meat size for their burgers. If you haven't visited lately they now offer two choices that are different than before.  2 oz flat meat patty for $4.75 or 2 flat patties for $9.00.    Because I have been coming here from the time it opened spending approx $9.00 would have been out of the question for a burger only but Ingo's burgers were exceptional and to my husband and I it was well worth it, as well as the drive from the far west side to come and enjoy a gourmet Grass-fed moist and juicy burger . But I can't say I would travel for this current burger. Or even if I were near I would not think of Ingo's like before.  Makes me sad    This has been such a constant count on experience for us and I thought I would never classify any of their burgers as common but unfortunately it is very common. They say the meat is the same but I can't tell due to the thin presentation.   Please please change it back",

Sometimes I find myself having to dunk veggie burgers in ketchup because there's not enough sauce on it, but this was just right! The spread had a delicious kick to it. Also I love pickles on the side but usually can't stand them on a veggie burger. I forgot to ask for my burger without pickles on it, but the pickles on it were actually really tasty!

My bf and my best friend both got the Texas burger and they really liked it. The burger seemed like it needed a crispy factor to it (there was bacon on it but the bacon wasn't crispy) but the flavors were all there. We also had the pistachio vanilla swirled soft serve. It was really good very light pistachio flavor that went well with the vanilla. The soft serve was not too sweet.   I do really like this place and would highly recommend everyone to try it.",

    "text": "Well, I liked the food here so much last Monday that I had to come back yesterday for some more! On my first visit I had fallen in love with the Kale salad and I just can't get enough of that. It's not quite enough to satisfy me as a meal, however, so both visits I got a sandwich too. First time I ordered the Paris, TX burger and it was fabulous; I would eat this every day of the week. BBQ bacon cheesburgers are my guilty pleasure but a lot of times they can get way too greasy and soggy. Ingo's version uses pancetta and grass fed beef which cuts down on the fat but amps up the flavor. This is probably one of the better burgers I have eaten but in the interest of trying new things yesterday I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. I thought they were being fancy by calling it chicken schnitzel rather than fried chicken but it made sense after I received it because it was a nice thin, skinless breast piece of chicken coated with a crispy breading. I think they probably do deep fry it because I don't know how else you could get the crust so nice and crispy but the meat inside was still very moist. Again it was not too greasy at all. I don't like aioli so she brought me some of their Dijon mustard and I thought it went perfectly.  I know I will keep coming back just because the food is so delicious but I also love the fact that they use organic and humanely raised meat products. Their prices are reasonable for the level of quality of the ingredients. Those two items (salad and sandwich) made a pretty filling meal for only $14. Service was great and even though the place is very small it wasn't too loud or cramped feeling. Really the only thing keeping them from 5 stars is the lack of parking. I can see that is going to be a big problem as they get more popular.",

It was a very kind gesture and after several months I made it back.  Once again this place has a killer atmosphere and extremely attentive and great waitstaff. Everything we ordered came out quick and tasty.   For an appetizer, I got their Deviled Eggs which had a rich and flavorful filling that is a step above most other deviled eggs. Next, I had the Chicken Sammy Sandwich which has an extremely awesome balance between the crispiness from the chicken, crunch from the granny smith apple, and added flavor complexity from the pickle and spicy aioli. It is truly a unique sandwich and unlike any other chicken sandwich I've had before.  So to circle back on my prior review, I do retract telling people to go to Hopdoddy's for a better burger. The Chicken Sammy, Post-It note salad, and Deviled Eggs were all delicious and live up to Ingo's \"Tasty Food\" motto. Perhaps from my first visit, the Ingo Cheeseburger just wasn't for me.   So why not a 5 star rating...because I'm still a little hungry. I know there are some places where you get way too much food and I respect the fact that Ingo's relies more on taste than quantity; however, with food so tasty I want my belly just a little bit fuller.",

So there's nothing particularly remarkable about the menu, on which burgers are the predominant item. Where the food does stand out though is the freshness and preparation: grass-fed beef and fresh veggies. What made my visit worth it was the fresh shattered potato chips served with a side of tart, creamy lebni. So highest marks for being creative with potatoes!!!!  The menu also has a few sandwiches and salads plus beer, wine and sangria. I REALLY hope that they start serving breakfast because it would be a great place to start the day. It's tiny but cheerful.....like a small diner complete with a circular counter around the open kitchen with some outdoor seating. Everyone working there is very friendly and light-hearted and they play good music which all really make this an enjoyable place to eat.

First of all, it's seat yourself, so of course we chose the patio! Great ambiance with strung lights all over.  The food was delicious! I had a chicken sandwich that I'm pretty sure will be my go to- yum!  The manager is hilarious! We joked with her the whole time and she even gave my boyfriend and I a free chocolate chip sea salt cookie. They are his favorite! (Definitely recommend them!)  She explained about their food and I can't remember what all was said because it's been a little while since we went but I was very impressed about the chicken!  Ask your server. I'm pretty sure it's grown locally but can't remember!  We can't wait to go back to enjoy the patio and eat some delicious food :)",

My chicken sandwich was great (but a bit on the small side) and my girlfriend's veggie burger was absolutely amazing.  The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the chips- they were smashed into small pieces that made it difficult to enjoy the dipping sauces that came with it.  Otherwise an excellent experience.",

The burger is perfection, and I am pretty picky about my burgers. The cracked chips and yogurt sauce are awesome as well. I've also had the heirloom rice bowl, the kale and quinoa salad, and the tuna burger.. All of which were great.  I can't wait to return for the egg salad at some point, though it'll be tough to stray from the burger. Their patio is dog friendly too! I LOVE that they have Scrimshaw on draft, and the happy hour prices are great. My only wish is that they had a larger beer selection to choose from.",

Their sangria is to die for and while they only have three beers on the menu they were good choices. Our waitress Erin was awesome! Friendly, quick and helpful.

Awesome little lunch spot, also nice for an evening beer / cocktail or two while taking in the scenery.  I truly enjoyed the spacious patio which offered lots of shade and ample people watching, as it sits on the corner of a busy intersection in a trendy area with other restaurants across the streets.    Really good, friendly service, and the veggie black-bean burger was one of the best I've had in recent memory.  Hangry for lunch?  Show up right at 11am weekdays to get a parking spot in the tiny lot and beat the rush!",

Ok, so why the 3 stars? My friend ordered a drink and there was still lipstick on his glass. Gross! The food is good but I question the cleanliness of the restaurant after this incident.

You walk in and you are immediately hit with a wave of scent from the grill, which is surrounded by the seats in a u formation.   The menu is simple. Booze and good food. We ordered the chips which came with an overwhelming number of chips with a delicious house sauce for dipping.   I highly suggest ordering some burgers. They give you the option of getting a slider or full size (awesome!!!!) of any of their burgers. First time here? Definitely get some sliders. It doesn't come with side, but it does come with a carrot (What's up doc?).   As I mentioned, it is SMALL.  Be prepared to wait or possibly break into smaller groups if you're with a larger party.   Ok, now for the best part. FREE COOKIES. Yes, you read that correctly ladies and gentlemen. FREE COOKIES FOR EVERYONE. When I went, there was a plate of cookies to take as you left. Others who were there mentioned they used to get cookies on their plate. I don't know how you'll get your cookies, but you are going to love these cookies.   Did I mention free cookies?",

A little garlicky for my taste, but I know my boyfriend - the garlic lover - would have enjoyed it. The sangria was great for $5.

    "text": "I have walked past this place probably a dozen or so times.  If I am down in this area, I am headed to Ingo's sister restaurant,  La Grande Orange,  for some pizza and baked goods.  I had always admired this beautiful, small, circular building, but I had never stopped in to try its food.  Recently, that changed!  I decided I would not cross the street to go to La Grande Orange, and instead, head here for a burger and some chips.  The pictures online and here on Yelp looked fantastic, and it was about damn time I tried everything out!    I drove down, parked in their overflow lot about a block down, and walked up to the joint.  A nice lady greeted me out on the patio and said that I could sit wherever I wanted.  I chose a nice little 2 top near a tree.  It was a beautiful 85 degree day out in Phoenix today, so I got some sunshine and shade all in one with the seat I chose.  I studied the menu for a bit and then placed my order.  I went with an order of Shattered Chips, a Paris Texas Burger (upgraded $1.00 to the grass fed beef) with no lettuce, and a glass of water to drink.  About 10 minutes later, my food was brought out to the table.  Here is how everything was............  Shattered Chips-  Um....FANTASTIC!  The word \"fantastic\" doesn't even really do them justice though. These \"chips\" are really thin sliced potatoes, deep fried to a golden brown, crunchy, yet still soft and chewy inside, piled high and then topped with some Lebni (pretty much a sour cream with a taste of lemon).  These chips also came with a little cup of green stuff that looked like salsa.  I took a bite of my first chip and was blown away at how great they were!  This was one of the best versions of ANY potato product I have ever had!  I dipped my chips in the Lebni and it was heavenly.  Next up, I dipped a chip in the green stuff.  WOW!   Taste explosion!  My waitress came around, and I asked what the green stuff was.  She told me that it was fermented/pickled jalapenos!  This stuff was awesome!  Tasted great, and packed just enough heat.  She told me that they were eventually going to bottle and sell that stuff.  I would buy it in a heartbeat!  It was a great compliment to the cold, smooth Lebni dip and the perfectly fried chips!  I would come back here again just for these chips...maybe order a take out container full of them.  They were flat out awesome! 5+ Stars!   Paris Texas Burger-  This burger came with a grass fed patty cooked perfectly medium, some cheddar cheese, some Nueskes bacon, pickles and some apple bbq sauce.  It usually comes with lettuce, but I left that off of there.  The only place lettuce belongs, is in a salad ;-).  This burger was presented very nice.  It was cut in half and held together by long toothpicks.  I took a bite and was pretty impressed.  The bbq sauce kind of overpowered everything, but it was still delicious and you could tell it was a high quality burger. The Nueskes bacon is awesome btw!  The grass fed beef itself was very tasty!   Maybe not the best burger I have ever had, but still a solid 4 star burger on its own.  I finished my meal, paid my check (just under $15.00)  and then walked inside.  Sitting there on the counter is a huge glass container full of mini sea salt chocolate chip cookies!  Yes, the same ones that they make and sell at La Grande Orange, only about 1/10th the size.  These cookies are like crack...I always have to get one whenever I go to La Grande Orange.  Perfectly crunchy, moist, gooey, salty and flat out delicious.  I grabbed about 5 of them, put them on a napkin and was on my way back to my car.  What a nice touch to end your meal!  Service was excellent!  All 3 of the ladies I interacted with were super friendly and helpful!  I will definitely be heading back here sooner than later.  Maybe a pizza from La Grande Orange across the street and an order of chips from here might hit the food jackpot, eh?  Wash it down with some mini sea salt cookies?  That, my friends, might be a perfect meal!  I will definitely be trying that combo out in the next month or so.  Can't wait!",

LGO has once again added a new place and it pleases on the more healthy simple side of the palette. Recently, I used a gift cert I had to try it out during a great winter day in Phoenix.. meaning, not the typical 'winter day' of anywhere else; The sun was shining and the birds were happily chirping as we were not under three feet of snow like other parts of the US. Ahhh us lucky Arizonians! We get to lunch in the winters on a sunlit patio.. and Ingo's has a great one! Colorful little tables adorn this picnic patio under the trees and on the corner for watching the life of whatever pass by. The menu is simple, as is the food. The special of the day is brought to you on a sticky note and thats cute. Clean and pretty healthy choices await you here at Ingo's. But if you're anything like me.. I can order everything healthy and then SOMEONE at my table inevitably will get the splurge factor involved that I can not resist. In this case and on this day it was the Fresh Shattered Potato Chips! Soo, so tasty! They are not 'chips' in the sense of being thin .. they are hand cut potatoes and a little thick with just enough sea salt and Ingo's hot sauce , (and yes, IT's HOT!(, or a creamy dipping sauce on the side. Too yummy for words! Completely shareable! We shared the Toni's Deviled Eggs that say they have goat cheese per the menu.. they were super good! I just don't know if I can say I actually tasted goat cheese. I also had the White Fish Club Sandwich.. and if you have read my reviews before, being from the bay area and growing up as the ocean as my back yard, I always ask if the fish is fresh. She assured me it was and I can attest that it tasted very fresh! I did the fish grilled versus fried and it was tasty! The sauce was amazing and made the sandwich very good! A decent serving at that! I also did a small Kale and Quinoa Salad.. YUM! The right amount of lemon sets the greens, grapes and red peppers offset with a smattering of parmesan, manchego cheeses and sunflower seeds into a spin for your tastebuds in this very healthy salad. I can see myself grabbing one of these to-go in large to fly with! Ingo's has housemade sangrias; cocktails; craft beers and LGO's own red and white wine. This was a 'school day' for me so no libations but Ingo's could be the perfect place for having cocktails on this great patio. They also have curbside service for 'to go' orders! In all of my years of living in the valley, not one LGO concept has disappointed me and Ingo's, by no surprise, did not either. I truly loved it.. a healthy, simple concept with clean ingredients! I only came in with 4 stars versus 5 on this review for the girl lacking in her energy in serving us.. I could not tell if she just wasn't into us or her day or her job! She barely cracked a smile .. I get it, as I have days like that too. Usually a perk of espresso makes me forget my woes for the time though! Nonetheless, nothing else could possibly have been wrong with Ingo's ! Can't wait to come back and hang out on the patio with sangria in hand!",

    "text": "I've been hearing how yummy this place is for quite awhile and I finally got to try it on a beautiful afternoon. First and foremost, parking can be a challenge as it's very limited but there's complimentary valet right across the street.   I sat on the patio to enjoy the weather and was greeted very quickly. My friend Taylor ordered a Greyhound cocktail and it was really tasty, sour from the grapefruit and cool from the mint. A great cocktail for a warm afternoon.  Taylor and I then ordered the Fresh Shattered Potato Chips. Now you might be thinking crunchy, actual potato chips but don't let the name fool you. Ingo's puts their own spin on a \"potato chip\" and serves up potatoes cut somewhat thinly, so their's still actual potato inside the \"chip\". See my posted picture for a visual. The aioli they serve up with the potato chips complements the overall flavor. The combo is mouth watering! Salty, soft & crunchy, with a kick of lemon.   Next we ordered the Farmer's Daughter Burger and the Crispy Chicken Sammie. If you like dijon and sauerkraut, go for the burger! The burger was so juicy, they make a perfectly cooked burger. The Crispy Chicken Sammie was a light sandwich, even for being crispy chicken. It's not greasy whatsoever. The apple on the sandwich adds a nice refreshing touch. Then the spicy aioli balances it all out. It's Ingo's take on a buffalo chicken sandwich but it's ten times better!  When our check arrived, so did three little cookies that were complimentary. I wish I had a whole basket of those cookies because they were chewy and buttery, finished off with some sea salt.   Overall, pleasant experience with incredibly satisfying food!!",

The deviled eggs at Garage are infinitely better.  The potato chips were good. Burger is fair at best-- meat wasn't bad but the bun leaves a lot to be desired. I much prefer the burgers across the street at LGO, at the Attic or at Chicago burger company.   With so many other great options in the area- Ingos just fell ridiculously short. You couldn't pay me to give it another chance.",

    "text": "Typically, I am wary of establishments that put the words: best, tasty or even yummy in their name. However, Ingo you are quite the exception!  Having breakfast at their sister store, La Grande Orange, across the street before it was an absolute must to visit Ingo's if you love their food. Instead of fresh juice, pizzas and crepes Ingo's provides grass-fed beef burgers, healthy apps and a good variety of wine and beer (some coming from CA) to cause some CA nostalgia.  Since I was dining with my roommate we decided to sit out on the patio and to share a meal with a couple of items so we could see what Ingo had to offer. We decided to start with the Hummus and Pumpkin Seed Guacamole served with crudites as our appetizer, the Paris, Texas burger to share and to drink the Black Market Hefeweizen and the Lyric By Etude Pinot Noir.  Hummus and Pumpkin Seed Guac- pretty large portion app for two people to share, good creamy hummus, with slight heat, thick consistency, the Pumpkin Seed Guac was not my fave, but it was all a personal preference. Comes with cauliflower, cucumbers, carrots, celery and golden beets.  Paris, Texas Burger- Really good burger, cooked well, juicy, love how the sharp cheddar cheese came through, crispy bacon, slight sweetness from the BBQ sauce and the pickles were awesome! They crisp the interior of the buns giving a good texturally crunch contrasting the soft, airiness of the outer bun.  Black Market Hefeweizen- Fruity, light, refreshing. I could drink this all night. Lyric By Etude Pinot Noir- Apparently acidic, tangy, berry flavor, spicy and tannic.  Great service through out the night, lovely atmosphere inside and out and awesome food! Definitely will be back to try their other burgers, the rest of the drink list and hell, I just realized they carry dessert here. Hold that last thought, I'm on my way back already!",

The outside patio is surrounded by trees so its shaded and really cute. You can definitely sit inside around the bar area. Okay, now let's move to the food. I ended up ordering shattered potatoes because literally everyone around me had a plate of these in front of them. I was not disappointed. They were delicious and paired well with the Ingo green sauce and lebne. I also got the veggie black bean burger, which I have to say is the best one I have had so far.  Definitely going back to try more stuff!",

Too bad they only serve it for an hour each day. So you gotta get there at a specific time.  Nice waitresses and they do a lot to make sure you are having a great meal. Totally recommend this place for it's quiet neighborhood, great food and the convenience of going across the street for dessert and drinks at the market and bakery... who is also own by the same company.",

I do a take out order and sit down to wait and then a large group of 7 comes in to sit so I give up my seat so they could sit together and the waitress thanks me and tells me to sit and as I sit this idiot in the group that sat in the seat I gave up asked me to move so he could sit next to his friend which there was a seat between his friend and I. Wanted to put my fist in his food since I gave up my seat previously and he was so ungrateful.   This led to my displeasure for my experience here.  I ordered the Ingo Burger with a fried egg which I specifically asked to not have sunny side up. As I opened my food later the first thing I see is a burger with a sunny side up egg. Also ordered the fresh shattered potato chips they were pretty good but the dipping sauce seemed a little off . Overall the food was average at best the service was average and the idiot in the restaurant was like a grade school punk . With all the quality restaurants in that area that will be the last time I will eat here",

I have warred with this place since it was built and took away the already scant parking for LGO and Postino's but I think it's time to wave the white flag and concede to Ingo's Tasty Food.  The place is small and quaint, inside is diner counter style eating with a nice shady patio outside.  The menu is, well, small, but we enjoyed what we had.  We started with the Post It Special of the day, Avocado Toast with Burrata, Heirloom Tomatoes, Grapes, Shallots, and Basil on Noble bread.  It was crazy delicious but the portion size was tiny for the $8 price tag.  Just once slice of bread with toppings.  Our burgers were very good, I had the Farmer's Daughter sans sauerkraut and The Boy had the Paris TX Burger.  The Shattered chips were just ok.  I like crispy, thin, potato chips and these were thick and soggy with some and thin and crispy with others.   What really won me over is the complimentary bite sized Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookie they bring you at the end of your meal.  I mean I still went over to LGO and bought the large version to take home but it was a nice ending to a meal to satisfy a sweet tooth.",

This restaurant has an awesome vibe and offers unique bar seating inside along with lots of outdoor seating. There isn't too much room in the building, but they have made excellent use of the space and done a great job decorating.  The employees were awesome! Definitely one of Ingo's main assets. They were so friendly and provided fast service. We ordered from our table outside and she was able to swipe the credit card right there on a mobile device.  They mostly offer burgers with a slight twist on the toppings. There weren't too many options to order, but like in and out, sometimes less is more. I can't eat wheat so I had to settle for a piece of meat with cheese on it, but that's the case at many restaurants so I'm used to it. There is definitely a market for gluten free food, so maybe they should consider offering some.  Their (only) appetizer was home made potato chips, but they were amazing and I would order them every time.  We ordered bottles of wine and drank from cheap plastic dixie cups. This is the only area I could see them improving on.   This place is definitely worth checking out!",

Ingos Cheeseburger is somehow the best burger I've ever had every time I have it.  The bun freshly baked in the neighborhood and lightly brushed with mayo, the tomato and the pickles, both thick and juicy, a bed of shredded lettuce for the juicy patty of meat to lay upon while being blanketed by a respectable slice of melting cheddar cheese.  If you have ever seen the episode \"Best Burger in New York\" of \"How I Met Your Mother\" Please refer to Marshals Monologue and then go eat Ingos Cheeseburger. Thank me later.  Chicken and Waffles are my next favorite dish at Ingos but it is only available for weekend brunch.  The chicken is just so good but add to it the strawberry jam they use with the syrup and waffles mmmm mmmm. I wish it was Saturday Morning right now.  The Chicken Sammy is my next regular at Ingos. It's great for summer or lunch anytime.  You know how they say opposites attract? This Sammy proves it.  It's hot & cold, it's sweet & spicy, it's savory & refreshing. I still recall the first time I tried it. It took me by surprise playing with both my senses and emotions, I was so young.  It was before I even knew about chicken and waffles.  Sometimes when I'm feeling saucy I get the chicken Sammy Paris style, or the Paris burger. Both great options if your feeling the whole bacon & BBQ sauce thing.  The chips! Gotta try the chips! The latki (sp?) white creamy sauce on top is amazing but make sure to get some of the green jalapeno sauce to dip it in also the bbq sauce! And sometimes even the spicy sauce they use on the chicken Sammy is good with the chips.  Mix the bbq, jalapeno and latki if your really feeling saucy.   Today I even tried the little salad. I'm not much of a salad guy so it took me off guard when I saw goat cheese and sunflower seeds but I trusted in Ingos and my great server Dama (sp?) and it was delicious! (Shout out to Dama hooking it up with the suggestions, sauces, and being on top of our drinks! ) Again the salad, very refreshing, when you get a good bite the mix of ingredients really compliment each other from start to finish!  I will definitely be having that again  Can't forget about the complimentary mini sea salted chocolate chip cookies they give for takeout orders!  These are addictive so be careful, you can buy the giant versions of them across the street at LGO.   My one complaint goes to the lack of Gelato Sandwiches. In the beginning there were these little round bites of heaven. I still remember the salted caramel melting in my mouth.  Makes me sad. I know the gelato is right next door at LGO but it's all about the cookie dough like super soft cookies used to hold in the freshly made gelato. WHY? WHY DID THEY STOP?!?! Can't LGO at least make them? I'm sorry to raise my voice but c'mon, it was the final piece to this puzzle I call lunch.    Anyways the service is always great, quick and helpful. You can tell the chefs take pride in what they make and present to you, which makes it all the better. Thanks Ingos!!",

But really, jokes aside, I am entirely disappointed with my experience. After the raving reviews, I was so excited to give Ingos a try, and break away from my LGO routine. NEVER have I ever been so disappointed. Sure, we were asked about our food by 3 different people, yet all of them were unable to crack even the tiniest smile while they spewed off their robotic dialogue. I'm sorry, did I bother you by being here? Do you understand what it means to be in the service industry? 100% will never go back.",

    "text": "We sat at the counter indoors for our first time.  We weren't sure about the noise level outside and we like to watch chefs at work.  Traffic level/noise at 6PM on a Wednesday was pretty minimal, so we will sit outside on the patio next time.  Order the shattered potatoes with the jalapeno sauce!!!  Amazingly good and they make them fresh right in front of you.  The potatoes are served with a ridiculously addictive dipping sauce called 'lebni' (greek yoghurt, spices & something highly addictive).  The 'lebni' was so tasty that we ordered a side to take home and try on other things.  Regarding the jalapeno sauce, they puree the peppers, add a few things and then let it 'ferment' for a week.  Then they add vinegar and a few other things.  Minimal heat level, fantastic jalapeno flavor.  Happy Hour -- $3 for good beer (and wine)!  We ordered two Paris burgers medium rare (we feel that it's a shame to overcook high grade, grass fed beef).  The meat was perfectly cooked with just the right amount red.  Amazing apple bbq sauce -- we ordered a side to go with the potatoes.  For something semi-healthy, we ordered their salad special for the night -- watermelon, feta, mint and pistachios.  Absolute perfection for an August night in Phoenix.  The people next to us ordered the kale salad and the avocado toast, both of which looked awesome.  It was funny watching them 'go foodie' on vegetarian food in a burger place.  :)  Regarding dessert, they do ice cream sandwiches from LGO ... but they aren't on the menu ... and they are really GELATO!!!  I had the 'fresh' mint chocolate chip & my wife had the salted caramel.    We are converts.  :)",

    "text": "Normally I am not a fan of 'the hipster burger joints', but in this case I was and there was a plethora of reasons to like. First off the bat is the fact that they have a very limited menu. Some people doesn't like this, I love it. If you want pasta, then go somewhere else. Want more beer options? Go to a bar. Doesn't want Chloe as a server, well I then loathe your very existence.  So from this limited menu, that is clearly dissected, analyzed and reassembled, I made a mistake. I ordered the Paris, Texas Burger WITHOUT asking it on a English muffin. I should have. I just should have.   Paris, Texas Burger The burger sure was fall apart tender. At the same time as the tenderness is a quality sign, it also make me look like a fool while trying hard to devour it. Innocently presented, but sneaky like a sloppy Joe. I gave up on eating it American style (that's with your hand people).. and resorted changing strategy to one with a fork. The flavors were there, but I would have chosen a different kind of cheddar, or maybe even go with a different kind of cheese (then again I am a stickler with consistency) and the pancetta  - it was freakishly awesome, was perfect as a burger topping and it came in profusion. What I didn't like was the bun. With that tender meat, the bun needs to be supportive, like a good friend during an intervention - not just pretty on the surface. The name of the burger doesn't make no sense at all. What is the Paris representative part? Was it that the bun was ready for an open relationship?   Fresh shattered potato chips This is the last thing that I need, but this is one thing that I will doubtlessly come back for. It looks like a sliced deep fried potato, but balances on that thin edge of awesomely crunchy before it would turn overdone. With this served Lebni which sounds like a east-european car brand, but isn't. Salt and pepper does the trick, but I would love to see a drop of fresh chipotle in there. Or the garlic-cucumber route to put a Greek spin on it. I'd also rename it 'devilishly specious potato'.  Beer While analyzing the beer choices, I couldn't agree more that the choices on the menu will suit most people thus make all sense to go that route. Again I love the decision to stay small, local & popular.   Homemade ice cream sandwich The choice of dessert is a an ice cream sandwich, with a scoop of peanut butter gelato as the buffer in this sweet menage a trois. I didn't like it - probably because peanut butter is not a dessert flavor to me. It's as deceitful as those parents that call raisins candy. It's lies.   Overall Ingo's did deliver. I didn't get to try the egg salad, that seems to suit everyone that had it. My hat is off for Mr Ruggiero, he knows what he has going here. And the service I assume was great, I know I couldn't have had a more informative and attentive server. Another reason why anyone would return.",

Both nutritionally and in treatment of animals.  All the other items on the menu are great as well, they have great beers, apps and other menu items besides burgers. The only recommendation I would offer the restaurant has to do with their \"to go\" burgers.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the bun and/or the way you request the burger to be cooked but only when I order to go I almost always get a soggy bun which I of course do not like. Eating at the restaurant this never happens.  Great place",

I really do enjoy walking there with my bf and our pup and hanging on the patio. They put cement down on the patio where it used to be dirt, and it makes a big difference! The service is always on point and the food is really good. The chicken Sammy and quinoa salad are bomb, and I love the white sangria - super refreshing on a warm day. Only reason why I'm not giving five stars is because I still think the servings are too small for what you're paying. Today I grabbed the salad with chicken and the avocado toast. The total was $21 for a small (but delicious!) salad and one piece of toast with avocado, tomato and mozzarella. Again, very good but a super small serving. Will I be back? Absolutely! But I may forgo grabbing a drink to make up for the food price. Thanks Ingo's, enjoy having you in our neighborhood!!",

However, I had to rate this place a little lower because our service was so bad. It started out fine, and she was really attentive and quick with our drinks and taking our order. Once she gave us our food, though, she pretty much never looked at us again. We were still hungry after the burgers and wanted to get something else and another drink, but after waiting for 20 minutes we just put our card down to pay and left (it took her another 5-10 minutes to get our card). It would be one thing if they were super busy or if she was stuck in another area for a while, but she passed right by us SO many times and never glanced over or seemed to see us trying to get her attention. I would like to come back here because I liked the food, but I probably won't rush back after such a frustrating experience :/",

First parking is an issue for all the establishments on the corner so that's nothing new. But we did find parking in the rear. That's what I saw that they keep the iced teas and the water or coffee (wasn't sure what but it was those huge beverage containers with spouts) outside near the bathrooms and in the parking lot area. probably should have left then it did not seem sanitary or safe. The server, while friendly, was clueless about the menu. I ordered the avocado toast which was around $9. You can find photos of it by others in the photo section.. The serving was a joke. The serving size was the size of something you would taste over your stove to make sure it tasted okay. It blew my mind that it didn't come with anything and it was $9. So after literally five seconds of eating the sliver of avocado toast I quickly left and went someplace else for a meal. How pathetic is that? LOL. also if you're still going to go please note that it is a super small menu maybe 20 items on it with the only side being potato chips.",

It's very very tiny you walk in and it's literally just a bar around the kitchen that seats maybe 15? I like the cozy feel and the servers are very attentive! We were in and out in about 30 minutes. Drinks came out immediately, the app came out super fast along with our entrees! I got the seasonal Rita, which was a frozen spiked lemonade with mint! It was so tasty. We started out with their shattered potato chips. They aren't normal chips but better. Almost a French fry feel. It came with a creamy dip and a spicy one, both were delicious. I got the black bean veggie burger it was to die for. You could tell all the ingredients are incredibly fresh. You literally watch the cook make it in front of you. The service was so friendly I can't wait to come back and bring friends!!",

Prices are on the higher side of moderate.  If you're in the neighborhood, this is a great \"meet me here after work\" kind of place.",

Really I can not find one thing wrong with this place, hence the five stars.  I ordered the Paris Taxes burger, and my wife got the special chicken and waffles. We ordered a side of \"chips\" on the side. The chips came out first, and they were like no chips that I have ever had before. Obviously house made, they were like tiny cuts of delicious potatoes with sour cream on top. They were very very good.  The burger was cooked medium rare and was very tasty. The house brewed tea that I ordered along with it was also very good. My wifes chicken and waffle was the bomb, seriously the best chicken and waffles ever!  Enough can not be said about the level of customer service. There was never a time when we felt neglected, nor did they hover. It was the right amount of attention. The manager even came out to check on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal.   This is a place I would highly recommend to anyone, try them out.",

Handcut chips definitely stand out from your standard side-- picture the first chef who tried dicing up a potato and fried it. You haven't tried it before and you'll like it. Texture was a 10, flavor lacked a bit for my taste (in all fairness I'm more of ranch and chipotle aioli on everything guy; their sauce is a more subtle sour cream flavor).   All three of us got the Paris burger-- picture a single from in-n-out for size, even your smallest of girlfriends will finish it. Don't get me wrong, appreciated flavor versus size.  I definitely advise getting the chips (and Stone IPA) to fill up.  On to alch. Although the simple menu is hip, I prefer a little more depth for the craft beer lineup.    Overall you'll enjoy their twist on a burger/diner joint. The 20 minute turnaround makes it a great call after work.   If I can't post my picture you'll have to take my word for it-- you're indulging in my first yelp contribution. Still a huge fan of Chloe.",

The grain is mixed into the tuna, so it looks more like a thin turkey burger than a slice of seared tuna. The sauce is a bit more spicy than I was expecting and reminded me of Sriracha. Over all it tasted great!   The potato chips are essentially thick slices of potato with a chive-y sour cream like sauce on top. It was excellent!   The Atmosphere - parking is limited but we found a spot. The location is off of Campbell and 40th near LGO. The circular design is unique and beautiful. The inside is set up bar style with full view of the kitchen, cozy yet open. The outdoors is just as you would expect.   Service - we were greeted multiple times and invited to sit where we'd like. Everyone we interacted with was pleasant, and helpful. Our food did not take too long and neither did the check!   It's a great place to go for lunch or dinner for a quick meal, they have drinks as well.   Total bill for two people $30+ tip includes two non-alcoholic drinks, two burgers, and a side.",

    "text": "I just found my sweet spot on the menu!  Crispy Chicken Sammy!!!  My second visit here, and again, I sat inside at the not too busy hour of 2:15.  Service, just as before, was rapid and friendly.  I had done my research, and already had a plan, so I didn't need to figure out the menu options this time.  I also already grasped the concept, and that the prices related to quality, organic, local ingredients.  I even knew what the numbers on the floor were for, although I didn't need to use them. (They are so if you are waiting for a seat, you know the order in which you get to be seated.  Pretty clever.)  I am now hooked on their Crispy Chicken Sammy.  They marinate their chicken breast in buttermilk, and pound it to make it super tender.  Then, it is lightly battered, deep fried, and served up juicy, crispy and tender on a bun with pickles, slices of granny smith apple (it works) and spicy aioli.  This is a sandwich that I intend to have frequently.  It is madly perfect.  Also to die for are the deviled eggs.  I wasn't sure how I would like the beets, but there are just a few pieces diced on top of each egg, and they work perfectly.  The eggs themselves were light, perfectly seasoned and piled high with deliciousness.  My shattered potato chips were perfect, and having the lebni on the side was the right way to go for me.  This trip, I added a Sangria to my meal, and it was just the right touch.  I also ordered a nice little house salad with goat cheese and sunflower seeds that I hadn't noticed on my last visit, and it struck me as a generous portion for the price.  Although I'm curious about other items on the menu, I think that I know what I will be eating here for awhile...Crispy Chicken Sammy, Deviled Eggs and Sangria.  I may eventually get around to trying something else, but I can't imagine a better meal.",

    "text": "Stand Up For Tasty Food!  Ingo's Tasty Food scores a big thumbs up for Trendy & Tasty. Awesome casual vibe with even better food.   The location's design and atmosphere set it apart from its surroundings. It has a nostalgic fresh off the grill, picnic in the state park kinda vibe, but with a modern twist, and killer music selection. But not too hipster... cause you know too many hipsters in one spot is just too much.  And say hi to Erin. She can make solid suggestions for you.  I had the Paris, Texas Burger and Fresh Shattered Potato Chips. Both cooked in front of me and to perfection. Paired nicely with Chardonnay to start and Cabernet Sauvignon with my meal.  If you like a little spice ask for the Homemade Lacto-Fermented Hot Sauce, made with only jalapeno, vinegar, garlic, and salt. Simple but super tasty with just the right kick.  Ingo's is a sister restaurant to Chelsea's Kitchen and la Grande Orange Pizzeria and Grocery, all within a few hundred yards of each other. Looks like this family of hot spots owned by Bob Lynn have it all figured out.  So great to find a small town favorite in a big city like the greater Phoenix area.  Don't miss it, and prepare to hang out, cause that's what your gonna want to do.  Finish the night with the Salted Caramel Gelato and Vanilla Cookie.  I'll be back.

This afternoon, my husband and I stopped for a burger and some wine. It was excellent. The food was delicious. The service was done with smiles for us. We were sitting outside enjoying our Phoenix 108 temps. with misters. It was delightful. There is no pressure to hurry up and get out. The ambience is that of a Parisian cafe and I can give you no higher praise than that.  Thank you for allowing us to really enjoy what w came for - good d food, good wine, and some relaxation.

First: parking is a bi*#%.  It's ridiculous. Truly. There are maybe 10 spots. You *can* park down the street behind a dry cleaners in the overflow lot for La Grande Orange.    Ordering:  weird.  Those who wish to sit outside need to go up to the ordering counter and place your order there. Then they seat you.  Okay fine. But come warmer weather and that window is going to be a cluster you know what.    We came for happy hour (they don't have one).  NO HH ?  That needs fixing.  Once you are seated then you can be waited on without having to go to the counter again. HOwever it's another pay as you go situation. Weird.  I will say the food was delicious.  I got the kale/quinoa salad and it was right up there with True Food's kale salad. However, it was more like a side salad portion. I mean, it's not a burger, it is a salad so it's not as filling. I was still hungry when I finished.    Everyone else got burgers and said they were outstanding.    Everything is a la carte, so you have to order a side on your own. My friends got the fried pottatoes and they were delicious.   The menu is quite limited but what we had was delicious, albeit somewhat small portions.",

    "text": "This is a very small casual sleek MODERN gourmet burger joint that also offers cocktails and beers. You're most likely coming here for the insanely great grass fed beef burgers. I had a really terrific beef burger from here before so this time I tried the sushi grade ahi tuna burger. The chopped up tuna patty was held together with whole grain and seemed light as air. The patty was topped with buttery avocado for richness and that spicy sauce made the burger really delicious. I also liked that the bun didn't seem too big and was sturdy but also seemed light at the same time. We shared the non-traditional deviled eggs. They were really large and tasty with a little fresh dill and pretty pieces of beetroot. We also shared the shattered potato chips. They were crisp and some had soft centers. The chips came with jalapeno sauce and labne. The jalapeno sauce that came with the chips was very tasty and the Lebanese style yogurt cooled you down so things don't get too spicy. When you're done they offer you complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies.   The help were extremely helpful and friendly.  The restaurant is hospital-like sparkling clean.   They offer a small dog friendly patio.  Parking lot is small.  A complimentary valet is located across the street.  High quality ingredients prepared to perfection with Great Service in a pristine clean environment deserves 5 Stars.",

My husband and I are LGO and Chelsea's junkies and thought we would give their other restaurant, Ingo's a try for something different.  We arrived around 9:10 on a Sunday evening on a holiday weekend, closing was at 10.  Our server was clearly not happy that she had to take care of us and wanted to get out of there by 10:00 sharp.  Our entrees were brought out almost immediately after the appetizer and once the entrees arrived, we were never checked up on or asked if we wanted anything else, even though our wine glasses were completely empty and we would have gladly taken another round.  The check was delivered before we were even finished eating.  As for the food, it was hit or miss.  My husband's Paris Texas (veggie) burger was tasty, but my whitefish sandwich was small and bland.  The hummus was average, but the pumpkin seed dip that came with it was delicious.  Oh, and the shattered potato chips were pretty damn good too.  We did manage to get out of there well before 10, thanks to our turbo server.  Might go back and try again at a time that is more compatible with the servers' party schedules.  They do have the infamous evil white sangria and chocolate chip cookies w/sea salt on your way out.  Yum.",

    "text": "We moved into the area exactly a year ago this week! We probably ate at Ingo's every night the first week we lived here because it was in walking distance, the people were amazing, and the food was soooo good. I am vegetarian and I of course tried their veggie burger. Hands down, this was the best veggie burger I have ever had, and I feel like I've tried them all. Finally, a restaurant was making something other than some black bean burger with corn or chilis. This and a portobello mushroom is everyones answer to vegetarians. Unfortunately, they changed the vegetarian option to a black bean burger. I was soooo sad about this because it was the one filling option for vegetarians on the menu. It's sad when the only option out there for vegetarians is the same option at every restaurant. There are a few other burger places popping up around this area and their options are also a southwest version of a black bean burger, and they all taste the same. Ingo's had it right with their original veg burger. One of their sister restaurants has a good one, Chelsea's Kitchen. But, Ingo's is one of my favorite places! Their old veg burger with an egg on top...I told everyone I knew that this was the best veg burger I have ever had. It was like the chef actually tried for us non-meat eaters, it was awesome. I hope they reconsider going back to that recipe. This is the perfect neighborhood place to walk to and just chill. I still highly recommend it to people we talk to. Now, my partner still goes a lot and I just order the hummus and have a few chips, but nothing worth a whole meal. Go to Ingo's if you are a meat eater, you'll love it!",

You should also look at the the Post-It Note special (which changes weekly). Don't forget the (free!) French-sea-salt cookies on the way out, either.  You can either sit outside, or inside at the bar in a tiny, modern, almost-hipster-but-not-in-that-annoying-way round building (bathrooms are out back). Service at the bar was *great* and super friendly (free samples were offered of the hummus/pumpkin seed dips for example; also got told about the gelato sandwiches). They have a small menu of beer and wine.   Only drawbacks; portions are smallish (burgers/sandwiches are stand alone so order sides if you're hungry) and prices are reasonablish but not cheap. That said, def making a return trip here next time we home Camelback.",

The menu is limited and aside from burgers doesn't have a lot of interesting options. Bathrooms are gas station style- accessed from the outside and in order to use them you have to wait in line to get a key from the ordering window. I was also bummed that my diet coke came in a (not as cold as I would hope) can served with a flimsy plastic cup sans ice.

Plenty of room and heat outside! Minus 1 star for the company's ever present parking issue. Don't try to valet at LGO/Postino. The valet service doesn't allow (but should) and isn't polite about it. However, the very attentive, amazing staff at Ingo's makes up for valet. Apparently, there is extra parking just north of building on 40th St too!",

Our server was lovely and provided friendly service. We both got the black bean burger and shared the house made potato chips. The chips were delicious with amazing dipping sauces. The black bean burger was the best I've ever had! Yes, it does fall apart quite a bit so be warned, but that really didn't bother us. Most bean burgers I have tried are very very dry and bland, but theirs was very flavorful and not dry at all. It left us both feeling full and satisfied. I love that they have options for both meat eaters and vegans. Usually places that offer vegan meals leave something to be desired, but they really nailed it with their burger.  Their fresh squeezed lemonade was delicious as well and tasted so fresh. Not too sweet. Just perfect.  Overall we left very satisfied!

The decor and ambience was cool and modern.  We sat at the bar which allowed us to see the cooks prepare the food.  My friend and I ordered the shattered chips, Ingo Burger and Paris Texas Burger.    The chips came out right away.  This was fantastic.  I would come back just for this.    My friend and I decided to split the two burgers as they both sounded good.  We pretty much had the same impression of both.  This Ingo burger had too much sauerkraut that pretty much overpowered the flavor making the burger part cold and soggy.  The beef was good but barely noticeable.  The Paris Texas burger was partially better but again had an overpowering sweetness with it's apple bbq sauce.  No complaints on the beef or the quality of the ingredients - just the balance of the flavors were off.  Overall the balance of the burger was no where near what you'd expect from a place like this.  What made it worse was the burgers are extremely small.  I'm not a big guy but after eating the burger and chip I was literally still hungry.  We didn't want to order another mediocre $8.25 burger each so we literally left to go to another restaurant nearby.   I might give Ingo's another chance just for the chips and maybe the 1 hour availability egg salad sandwich.  As expected the service was excellent and the complementary sea salt cookies are a nice touch.",

    "text": "Well, last time we came here, about 8 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars easily. Great burgers, everything was grass-fed beef, great happy hour prices, great atmosphere. Today, we came here after eagerly anticipating Ingo's, and it was disappointing. Now, it's $1.00 extra for grass-fed beef, and we were totally rushed by the waitress. We wanted to relax, have a few drinks, then order, but we were continually pestered to order, even though there were a ton of empty tables. We had the shattered fries, which were far greasier than usual, and we had the Farmer's Daughter burger and the Paris, Texas burger. Neither burger was worth writing home about. After 2 drinks and our burgers, our waitress just came and placed the bill on our table without even asking us if we wanted anything else. Totally killed the experience.  Food... Not nearly as good as it used to be. Drinks.. Greyhound is great but is $8 Waitress? Terrible.  Unfortunately, we won't make the trip here again when there are far better places to enjoy a few drinks and food in a much better and relaxed atmosphere.",

We started with shattered potatoes chips and a Paris, Texas Burger washed down with a refreshing Almdudler to really round off the salty savory flavors.  This sister restaurant to the LGO (La Grande Orange) market right across the street really lives up to name Tasty!  The chef was close enough to watch them make your meal, and a little Carmel ice cream sandwich made by the gelato place in LGO really made an exceptional conclusion to our new favorite spot!  Greatly looking forward to our next visit, quietest times on Saturday are before 700p if you enjoy a quieter experience  Recommended for quick meals at the bar with friends- 4.9 Stars",

    "text": "A beacon of light amongst a grim and draining work seminar.  During a work trip in Phoenix, I decided I needed some good food to keep me from trying to strangle myself with my conference lanyard. As always, I turn to yelp to guide me in the right direction. On overnight trips I get a dinner expense allotment and try to buy as many items as possible before I hit the max. If you're going to keep me in a cold, dark room for 10 hours and feed me nasty turkey meat and caesar salad all day, you will pay (literally and figuratively).  I found this beautiful gem and decided to get an Uber for pick up. I called ahead and they have curbside service which is cool. I ordered 4 items and only used 1/3 of my allotment. As a regular person, that's awesome! As a tired employee seeking vengeance, I was bummed out. I get there and run into two of the nicest servers/cashiers/to-go bag getters ever. They are just so helpful and happy, especially since they were about to close, I was so confused. They also kept complimenting me, that I started really feelin myself a little too much on a Tuesday night.  I get the green sauce and some cookies and I'm on my way. I decide to give a cookie to my Uber driver for waiting. He was pleased.  I ordered the deviled eggs, kale salad, chicken sammy and black bean burger.   Kale Salad - UM. YES. Kale on it's own, can really bum someone out. But this salad was amazing. The flavors blended so well. And even though it's not the biggest, it's rather filling.  5 Stars  Deviled Eggs - Good. It was closer to an ice cream scoop on the egg than a dollop. Nice and creamy. Memorable though? Not really. 3.9 Stars  Black Bean Burger - UM. YES Please. Simple burger, but great. Soft bread. Flavorful patty and spread. Just a good bite. Spicy though? Not to me. 4.8 Stars  Chicken Sandwich - Another win! Although I must admit, at this point I started getting dizzy from all the wonderful flavors building up on my palate , I thoroughly enjoyed it. The chicken wasn't really crispy (again, it was take out), but the sandwich is good. Nice kick from the aioli and balance from the apple.  I know you're wondering, did she finish it all? Well, you'll never know. I don't like being judged, especially on crowd-sourced websites. But what I will tell you is that I feel like a champion.  Oh, and I have yet to try the complimentary cookie, but my awesome Uber driver thought it was great.",

Beer, wine, sangria, maybe a Moscow mule or a signature cocktail. Not a full bar.   Food is quick and delicious. Burger, chicken sandwich, fish sandwich. A salad or two. Not an extensive menu out of that little kitchen but it's all pretty good.   I do recommend the shatters chips. The deviled eggs are pretty good too if you like deviled eggs. Not spicy. Mustard based not mayo based eggs.   Dog friendly patio. That could be a plus or a minus depending on your taste but at dinner it's usually a dog, maybe two. Not crazy.",

I was starving by the time we'd decided to have dinner, and my meal was more than filling. I'm not vegetarian, but I tend to eat veggie when dining out, and I LOVED my burger.. it was perfectly crisped on the outside and that vegan cheese is still making me drool. The fries were amazing -if you're not a huge potato chip fan, you could definitely share this, since it's a very generous portion.

They have limited seating inside but a large patio which is dog friendly! :) the service is always friendly and they get you your food quickly! My phone died at lunch (boo) :( so I couldn't snap pictures of my food but I would love to describe what I had! It's going to make me hungry talking about it!  Shattered potato chips - my favorite thing about this place and what makes me keep coming back. Delicious crispy potatoes served with a yogurt sauce and jalapeno salsa that is spicy and I would put it in anything! Love these, don't skip trying!   Kale & Quinoa salad - super fresh! Great flavors! They also serve this salad at LGO and seems to be very popular! The lemon zest on the salad is a delicious touch! This salad is light and perfect for lunch. You can add a protein if you desire.   The Duchess - French dip sandwich with a very soft bun and flavorful au jus! They pile the meat on and you definitely get your money's worth! It's a limited menu item, so try soon!  Veggie burger - I got the smaller size (they have two) and I am glad I did because it was so filling! The patty itself was a little dry and was crumbling and falling apart which made it a little hard to eat, but that doesn't take away from how yummy it was! It had a kick, there was some spice there! They put a cashew cheese on it that calmed the spice a bit. Worth a try and a great option for vegetarians!   The greyhound is my favorite of the cocktails - gin & grapefruit juice? Say no more!  Ingo's is a cute little neighborhood spot! (Same company as LGO) definitely worth checking out if you've never been",

    "text": "So disappointed in Ingo's, especially since I love LGO and Buck & Rider. This was only my second time visiting. My first visit was less than stellar but we live right around the corner so decided to give it another shot. We chose a table outside right by a heater since it was chilly. We asked the waiter to turn on the heater.  We both ordered a cheese burger, but my boyfriend added bacon to his, and the potato chips. The potato chips came out first, they were great! We love the sauces. Then the burgers. Immediately we noticed that it was missing the bacon. She took it back, added the bacon. Nothing major there. Then I took a couple bites of my burger, which were very good until I felt something strange in my mouth. I immediately spit it out and start pulling a long hair from my mouth that was cooked into the meat. Augh. It was terrible. I always threw up. We told the waiter that was very apologetic and took the burger immediately. I didn't have anything else to eat that night since I was so grossed out. They didn't make me pay for the burger which was good.   The location was not super packed and had several empty tables where heaters were not on. A couple decided to sit next to us by the heater that was on. We ordered a pitcher of beer, so we were hanging out until we finished it. A few minutes later, the couple complain about the heater being too hot and requested they turn it off. Without hesitation or even asking us; that were there first and specifically asked for the heater to be turned on, the waiter turned it off. We had two full beers left to drink. It was 60 outside and not comfortable enough to sit in the cold so we just left.   It was just one thing after another and I was disillusioned that already my meal had been ruined, but then my beer drinking got ruined too. I won't be returning. Do better, Ingo. Thanks.",

    "text": "Ingo's is a regular stop for me. Maybe it's the complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies or the fact they are located on one of the coolest foodie corners in the Valley (40th St & Campbell). I just love the laid-back vibe of this place. The round, metal building they are located in and the dog-friendly outdoor patio seating area make it a unique dining experience. There is walk-up window toward the parking lot that you can order from. If you prefer to dine inside, there is a curved bar area where you can sit and watch your food being made. Part of the LGO hospitality group, Ingo's specializes in gourmet burgers made of grass-fed beef that are cooked medium-rare. My favorite is the Paris Texas Burger (just think apple BBQ sauce and smoked bacon) The shattered potato chips come with the burgers and are really good and come with a special sauce to dip them in. If you are not in the mood for a burger, get the Crispy Chicken sandwich. It has a spicy aioli sauce on it that is to die for. Ingo's has a pretty decent beverage list that includes a variety of local beers, wine, teas and a yummy homemade lemonade. This is one of my favorites spots when I am in a mood for a quiet relaxing evening of eating good food or an afternoon lunch. They also serve breakfast and happy hour is M-F 11am - 7pm.",

    "text": "Rude Obnoxious STAFF.  AVOID this place.   Went for lunch but parking lot was full so I had to park in their curbside parking spot since there was no where else to park. One of their employees yelled at me that I could not park there. I was going to grab a sandwich to go but her attitude was unacceptable.  There was no where else to park.  Their staff is never friendly or inviting. It is obvious no one likes working there.  Yelling at a customer is unacceptable for any reason. I thought they had a walk up counter to order food but she really ticked me off.  I won't return. I usually ate there 3 times a month.   I ate here 2 weeks ago and the owner, I assume was yelling st the manager regarding the POS system.  Apparently many were broken and he was upset because they let customers break them. So rather than take my order he was chastising her and other employees.  Finally someone took my order grudgingly.  This gentleman kept staff from helping customers because he was upset about the POS. There is a time and place for staff meeting but don't do it in front of customers and diminish the service and yell at staff in front of customers.  Obviously there are many issues with this place.   The food is good but no one ever welcomes you or greets you. They only ask are you ready to order. No smile, no small talk, they ignore their customers.   La Grande Orange is across the street with better food and friendly staff.  The staff at La Grande Orange are very accommodating and you feel welcome.",

Potato chips : its worth a special mention. Chips are  deep fried but not completely fried. Like weird but tasted amazing with the green dip.  Amazing ambience and music. Not really sure about the groups. Totally worth a visit.",

Chill atmosphere,good music, friendly staff, cool-looking chefs(love the mini-mohawk man) and nice patio(dog- friendly).   First bite of their burger is like no other, light, airy, crisp & flavorful at the same time.   Buns are deliciously toasted, good sharp cheddar cheese,  crisp bacon,  juicy burger patty that is steamed then finished off with a pink center! Eh, on the pickles, too salty.  Great shattered potatoes(like my mom's) with a creamy dill(?) dip. Didn't care for their home made jalapeno dip that doesn't pair well with the potatoes, possibly better with tortilla chips.  Delicious, tart lemonade.   Overall, a must try!",

When it comes to burgers, there is absolutely nothing better. Grass-fed meat melts in your mouth and is the absolute perfect size, never leaving you overly stuffed and bloated and instead always happy and satisfied.   Here are are my go-to's but you CANNOT go wrong. Drink: Greyhound (MUST) Apps: crudites (fresh heirloom veggies with homemade hummus and pumpkinseed dip-- I told you I was a regular) and shattered potato chips (ask for a side of homemade hot sauce). Burger: Farmers daughter with an egg or any burger with an egg! Crispy Chicken sandwich or tuna burger mmm! Oh yeah chicken and waffles are to die!   INGO on!",

    "text": "We are new to Phoenix and saw this place as we drove by and thought it looked super cute. We looked it up and say good reviews so went for an early Sunday dinner.  We saw inside was only counter seating, so although it was still pretty hot, we sat outside. We ordered iced teas which were tasty.  (I would have had more if I knew there were free refills!)  We ordered Shattered Potato Chips, a cheeseburger and Troubadour Egg Sandwich.   The potato chips came out first. They are potatoes sliced into circles and fried incredibly crisp. We just made big eyes at each other after the first bite. The sauces were good, buy I preferred them just as they were. The egg sandwich and the burger were both solid. No big eyes but very good and fresh tasting.  We asked for dessert and were told they only had complimentary cookies. OK! These were super tasty too and a nice touch.  We were discussing our experience while waiting for the check, saying we really liked the vibe and the food was good while being very reasonably priced. Just then the waitress came over and said the manager was comping our meal because it took longer than they like for it to come out. What? We did not think it took an unusually long time and we did not complain. We argued, but they would not have it. It's nice to see a business holding itself to superior standards even if customers are used to service that may not be the best. We left a nice tip and promised to come back soon.",

The wrap around counter is really cool and a great use of space. Outdoor seating is great too. Very little parking available on site, but Ingos is worth the walk.  Please don't bring your small children here unless they are well behaved. This place is much too small for disturbances.   I highly recommend trying Ingos. If you are met with a long line or wait, please know if you wait, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Beautiful little spot with healthy, yummy food at great prices (for reasonable portions, all a la carte).  They call it a gourmet food stand which is basically a healthy, quick little burger-type joint, with beer, wine and lemonade.  My husband and I split the tuna and veggie burgers, both of which tasted healthy and delicious.  The ground tuna is mixed with bulgur wheat and topped with lots of avocado, and the veggie burger is a fresh mix of neat stuff - veggies, cashews, brown rice.  I do plan to ask for tomatoes on the tuna sandwich, next time.  Note: the portions are on the small side.  I personally love a place that serves the amount I'd like to eat and charges accordingly, but it's good to know.  There are tables inside and outside this small, circular restaurant - it looks delightfully swanky but it's totally casual.  If you're in the mood to grab and go,  there are several convenient to-go parking spaces, a dedicated pick-up window and super quick food.    After hiking Camelback, it's a great close place to stop to eat something yummy that doesn't negate your fitness efforts.",

    "text": "This is a fun local eatery with great outdoor seating and complimentary chocolate chip sea salt cookies!  Their shattered chips with jalapeno sauce are a crowd favorite. I'd liken them to a cross between french fries and potato chips, or the natural word-meld \"frips.\" Some are thicker cuts of tater, others are thins crisps, so everyone is happy. One order is good to share as a side for two people. I also overheard a guy at the next table ask for a half-order which isn't on the menu, but apparently is allowed!  My husband and I had the Paris, Texas Burger and White Fish Sandwich. Both were good, although the fish serving was a bit small and the buns were the kind of white bun that leaves you feel like you're eating air.   We didn't order drinks, but they have a ridiculously long happy \"hour\" that runs from 11am to 7pm and includes beer, sangria, wine, and cocktails.  The decor is colorful and tables are well-shaded. My only other critique is that the service felt a bit over-attentive. The waitress asked permission to refill our water glasses and cleared my plate while I still had a bite in my hand (not to be pushy, just trying to serve well). Although, I am coming from cold Boston, so the friendliness is partially just a bit of a culture shock!  Overall it's definitely worth a try. Check out the LGO grocery and knick knack store across the street if you have time to poke around, and don't forget to grab some of those complimentary cookies on your way out!",

We started with the deviled eggs, they were not our favorite. They tasted of whole grain mustard and lots of mayo, topped with a small pickled beet, that had no flavor. The menu describes goat cheese, of which I could not detect. Hubby got the fish and chips, one large piece of sea bass perfectly fried with shattered potato chips, which are thinly sliced rounds of potatoes deep fried. They were pretty good, and it seems that everyone there was ordering them. The fish was moist with a crispy exterior of light batter. The homemade tarter sauce was really tasty. I ordered their kale and quinoa salad with an added protein of grilled chicken. I liked the addition of sliced red grapes opposed to cherry tomatoes. The prices are extremely fair. For me, nothing was outstanding or something I'd crave and go back for.",

Although parking can be a real nag, once you actually sit down it's smooth sailing from there. Fun fact: their miniature parking lot sucks. But there's 2 separate lots a few blocks away for Ingo's and LGO.   They have a wait staff who are quite knowledgeable on the entire menu. I couldn't make up my mind on a drink (was undoubtedly necessary at this particular midday) and she got me hooked on the Ingo's Greyhound. Had I not had errands to run, I probably would've had another! Their food menu appears absolutely amazing (hellooo burger selections), but what stood out was the post-it lunch special salad. I was told it's quite popular so much that they've made it a lunch staple. Get it with the grilled chicken for an extra kick.   Can't wait to eat here again!",

The interesting thing was the menus or inside of a metal canister with a pencil and we had no drink menu. We weren't sure if we had to go up to the counter or if someone came and served us at the table. But after a few minutes are young girl came by and explained everything except the drinks. We had no idea until we saw our neighbors get lemonade that they even offered anything before that. They are sensitive to people's allergies and they have cashew based cheese and black beans vegetarian burgers. That is all exceptionally nice when you're watching your food allergies.  The food was fresh and prepared in a tasty way, and the waiter was very attentive until the end.  That's when I had to go inside to find someone for our ticket and a to go cup for lemonade. But the wonderful bonus of going inside is: they have free cookies. I don't know if they were gluten-free or something else but they went down good.",

If it's crowded you will need to be patient for service but the fast delivery from order to table is on point. My niece and I loved the homemade house chips. I enjoyed a fluffy tasty fish sandwich and she a burger. The deviled eggs were tasty but heavy on the mustard flavor. If you like mustered you will love the deviled eggs. I enjoyed a tasty craft beer and my niece a coke. She really liked how the coke was served in an old school bottle. Will come back if we are in the neighborhood and glad we tried it out.",

Ordered half-portions of two appetizers and the \"seasonal 'rita\" since I had a YEE (Yelp elite event) to attend after the meal.  Strange that I was charged full-priced for the drink after I was told that the cocktails were $2 off during HH...  Oh, well.    I like that I was able to order half-orders on almost everything on the menu, except the Crispy chicken sandwich.  And to be able to change my mind and do full orders mid-meal is even better!  I tried the special salad of the day, which was the Orange-Fennel salad, minus the orange (allergy), and the Shattered Chips-- deep-fried slices of potato chips dusted with cracked salt and garnished with lebni and homemade jalapeno sauce.  Both were fabulous!  The salad came with goat cheese and almonds.  I was not aware that it also came with avocado (allergy), so I had to fish the pieces out.    No dessert, as Ingo's Tasty Food is part of the LGO restaurant concept, and the idea is to have people experience deconstructed dining by eating food here and then crossing the street to have dessert at LGO.  There was a footed stand of complimentary salted chocolate chips, which I was told I could help myself to, which I did, but the cookies were too salty and too hard/dry.  I'd suggest to pass on these, unless you like over-salted and rock-hard cookies...  Hope to return soon!",

Parked West of the building in the neighboring lot and it's a pretty small lot so it was not the most fun maneuvering around or getting out afterwards.   Had the Paris Texas Burger, Fresh Shattered Potato Chips, and the Housemade Lemonade. The Lemonade wasn't sweet at all, so you might want to ask for some sugar packets. The Paris Texas Burger was savory and delicious. The atmosphere was pleasant, had string lights, and trees. Definitely a great spot in the evening. Service was excellent, attentative and amiable! The Shattered Potato Chips were okay, they taste super salty and burnt to me.  But loved their version of tzatziki sauce. Would go as far as to say that their sauce was better than the chips. The complimentary cookies were very hard/tough.  Burger, atmosphere, and service was great! Not a huge fan of the parking situation, lemonade, or chips.",

For almost 8 months now I have received nothing but bad service and I have withheld writing a bad review because I figured I have just been coming on \"off days.\"  Several months ago I was craving my usual, black bean burger on an LGO English muffin, I ordered curbside pick up, picked it up after work, drove all the way home, North Scottsdale, only to find sriracha dairy spread in my burger. I called and the manager wasn't available, it was at that time a bald gentleman if I remember correctly. I filed a complaint and he called me back, left me a voice mail and basically called me a liar saying he knows for a fact there was no siracha dairy spread because he himself made my order (he got confused and thought I was talking about the side of siracha). I called him back and he told me he would refund me and email me some gift card. That never happened, it's been about 8 months or so.  I let that go, no big deal, and continued going. I had mostly bad experience but I continued giving my business. It wasn't up until my last three incidents where I decided to change my review. I had hubby pick me up my usual order, he got home, I started eating it, I found hair in. I decided not to complain, mistakes happen. Second time I had my hubby pick me up my usual order, he came home, I find a hair in it. Okay, mistakes happen. Third time he went and picked up my order, he comes home, I check my burger, there are no tomatoes, no pickles. Just lettuce and the avocado and onion I ordered as an add on.  I'm really now starting to think this is all intentional or something. I can't be THIS unlucky.",

It melted in your mouth with the freshly baked bun. I love how they show where they get all their ingredients locally on their menu. Service was fast and the waitresses engage you in conversation and dont act like youre some shmuck and ignore you. Wish they had a larger beer selection and that my Stone IPA was served in a glass pint instead of a plastic wine glass type of cup. I understand they are going for a \"no dishes\" theme but hate drinking good beer out of a plastic. Drank enough natty light and keystone out lf red cups in college and get flashbacks. Anyways, nice place and they have a pick up window too if you dont want to sit you can take your \"craft burger\" home! We also got a free salted carmel cookie on the way out the door! Place was a little gem. Check it out if you get a chance.",

Knowing Ingo's was a design concept from the makers of LGO and Chelsea's Kitchen we knew it would be worth the wait...and Ingo's did not disappoint. The property is small, quaint, modern and clean. The staff is enthusiastic, friendly and excited to share why they love working there. The patio is a nice addition for the cooler months and I look forward to watching it mature with the trees that were planted to offer shade in the warmer months. Some have criticized the portion size but I find them refreshing in our \"super-sized\" dinning culture. What their sandwiches lack in size they make up in quality. My wife in I have a favorite chicken sandwich at another specialty sandwich spot in southeast AZ but Ingo's Crispy Chicken Sandwich is our new favorite. I had the namesake burger (the Ingo's burger) and it didn't disappoint. Ingo's is a keeper and I can't wait until our next trip.",

    "text": "Food: Solid. Any place that cooks a burger medium rare without me having to request it automatically gets bonus points. I got the Paris, Texas Burger. The beef was tender and well seasoned, the produce was fresh, the pancetta on it was crispy and delicious, the bun was decent appeared to be made in house. The Shattered Potato Chips were great. They came with lebni on the side which, isn't my cup of tea, but if you dig lebni I'm sure you will love it. The beer was fresh (very important for an IPA). The section left something to be desired, only 3 on tap and no bottles.  Atmosphere: Decent. Lots of outdoor seating. The building is interesting to look at. They have heaters for the chilly evenings, I have no idea what it will be like in the summer. I think the theme is kind of \"convenience stand\" and so all food and drink comes in/on disposable dishes/cups. Definitely interesting, but I definitely prefer my beer out of a glass.   Service: Excellent. Everyone was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. The one downside to this all is that you tip up front when you order your food before you sit down. I'd probably prefer the ability to tip afterwards.",

All of the food was awesome - the other couple we went with had the same reaction. The executive chef, Dom, came out to check on the food and introduce himself to us which was a nice touch. I love the architecture of the place...they managed to do a great job with such a small lot. I will definitely be going there again!",

Paris TX burger was interesting, a little sweet for my taste, but a noble effort. Kale and quinoa salad and lemonade were fine, but nothing special. All in all, a great place to side outside and enjoy a quite tasty causal meal.  Better than LGO IMO.",

But on my stop by the takeout window today at noon I knew I wanted something different and told the young lady working the counter (wish I'd asked her name so I could acknowledge her...cute brunette...ponytail I think). Rather than give the \"everything is amazing\" line that annoys the crap out of me she recommended a single item that she thought I would like, the Paris burger. She even gave me a food hack to ask for the next time I'm there (chicken sandwich with Paris burger toppings). I got home, devoured the delicious burger (I'm not normally a grass fed guy) and am already thinking about the chicken sandwich with Paris toppings she recommended. Kudos to Ingo for truly tasty food and also for such a great staff of friendly and knowledge people. They make the food even tastier...especially for people like me who score atmosphere and energy of a place right up alongside the food.  The Stand may have the best overall burger in Acadia/Arizona/America? but for the complete package, Ingo's Tasty Food can't be beat.",

    "text": "Had lunch with a friend this week.  Can't say I would want to go back.  Service  (patio) was great.  Paris Texas burger was very good although a bit on the small side.  Guess I must have automatically gotten the petite size and did not notice they had a regular size offered. I had read the reviews of the smashed potato chips and was hoping to experience a really good side but alas it was a BIG disappointment.  The chips were mostly burnt and the lebni sauce wasn't all that good.  The pickled jalapeno sauce was at least enjoyable when I could find an unburnt chip to dip it into.  The Moscow Mule was served in some type of copper cup which transferred the tinny taste to the drink so that was most unpleasant.  Might have been better if it had not been served in the cup but I am not going back to get another one and ask for a glass container to see.  On the whole if you stick to the regular size hamburger and forget everything else on the menu you will not be disappointed but if you try other items be ready to be sorry.  After all the good reviews I read I am wondering about their taste buds have gone on strike or they just don't want to truly critique the place.",

Now to the food...I had the Paris, Texas burger and it was delicious!  There were a lot of things on the burger that I would normally hold but all of the flavors worked really well together.  The buns are delicious since they come from the LGO bakery and the other ingredients tasted fresh.  We will definitely be coming back to enjoy the HH and I will try the shattered chips next time as I heard they were good.  They also have \"Post-It Note\" specials everyday which is a cool idea.",

The chicken sandwich was ordered grilled, but arrived breaded and was sent back. That was just the beginning of service that was just awful. The food arrived, but we had no silverware or napkins. One of my group of 3 asked for utensils, so the waitress brought her a knife and fork. The other 2 didn't get any. Then I asked for utensils (ordered burger with no bun-I really needed utensils) and she brought mine, but no napkin, and neither for the 3rd person. When the chicken sandwich came prepared as ordered, she STILL didn't bring utensils! Later after the plates were cleared the waitress asked my friend if she wanted more ice water. She didn't offer iced tea to the other 2 people sitting there with empty glasses. Then another server filled up my friend's glass with black tea, but didn't fill mine with green. I had to ask yet another server for more tea. It was bizarre-they couldn't see the needs of the whole table, just 1 person at a time. They need to hire some smarter people, these dingbats are hurting business.",

Upon arrival, we found out it was a paying event.  I think this was a ploy by the owners to \"bait and switch\" loyal LGO customers.  After looking at the limited menu, we decided to go elsewhere.

Ingo's is very small and cozy, but has a wonderful wrap around patio that's great for people watching, and also dog friendly.  The menu here is limited, but don't let that deter you. Ingo's is a little gourmet burger joint specializing in grass fed beef. The burgers are simply amazing. They are recommended cooked medium pink, which is really the best way to eat them . They're also available in two sizes...petite (3 oz) and regular (5 oz.). Do yourself a favor and get the regular. Otherwise you may be ordering two burgers, not just because they're small, but because they're that good! The other thing not to miss are the shattered potato chips served with Lebni ( a Greek yogurt sauce) and pickled jalapeno sauce. Sounds weird, but it's so delicious, especially mixed together! For libations they feature LGO's famous white sangria, and a wonderful Greyhound.  Good stuff. Check it out.",

I was there yesterday and I had the \"new\" Avocado toast.... why?? Why would you change such a perfect dish?!?! :(  I loved your old version. It was soooo good. I am not feeling the dates at all. I just don't get it. I would actually never order again now. Please consider changing it back. I beg you....   My suggestion is that you bring back the rice bowl for the winter! I loved that dish.   Anyway... everything is still fabulous. I love the chips, salad, burgers, chic sand, and the new egg troubadour sandwich :)",

As per the manager's recommendation, we ordered:  1) Hummus & Pumpkin Seed dip (which was the best hummus I've had in AZ!): the veggies were fresh and I loved the selection of veggies they provided 2) Kokuho rose brown rice bowl (rice, feta, pistachio, shiitake, egg, and herbs): at first, it seemed just okay. Then we remembered our server had given us a jalapeno sauce to go with it. It was the key ingredient! It really brought all the flavors together. 3) Shredded kale and quinoa salad (sunflower seeds, grapes, preserved lemon, red peppers, parmesan, manchego): there was a little too much dressing, but it was a good salad overall  The service was fantastic. Everyone was friendly and I liked how they all helped each other. It was lovely to be able to dine outside on the dog friendly patio! By the way - the servers were attentive to the four-legged patrons as well.",

Come a little early 11am, or late at 1pm to miss the rush at lunch.   Offers an insane military discount at about 50%. However, without that, it's a bit expensive (if justified for quality of ingredients and all). Some of the best burgers and lemonade around; I usually get the Paris Texas burger with an order of chips and lemonade.   I'd give 4.5 stars but that's not a thing on Yelp.",

Just the way my mom would make them, thinly slice  up the potato into circles and fry them up nice and crispy. The two sauces that came with the chips were splendid. One order is plenty for two people. Two people $30 for burgers chips and drinks. I will defiantly be back and recommend it if you just want a chill place to relax and grab some good food!!",

It makes me wonder how much clientele they get during the vicious summer months...think heavy use of water-misters.   I also love the small, intimate feel to the place. It gives it character. At the same time, the surrounding area feels like a social dining experience with La Grande and Postino's on the other side of the street, so Ingo's doesn't feel alone and isolated.   I've had the Paris, Texas Burger and the White Fish Club Sandwich. Both are really good and I highly recommend. I would call it fine-dining of traditionally fast-food. One other thing I noticed is that the portions of the main dishes are a little small to what I''m used too, but I think that just means appetizers are in order.   Parking within the immediate area is limited, but more parking is available a block north and on the other side of the street. A nifty accessory they carry is a hanger, which is a rod that's about 3 feet off the ground, which is used to hang your bags on.",

We went a couple weeks back and had the chicken sandwich and it was completely different and not very good in our minds, but we love this place so wanted to give it another try...who knows, it could have just been the night we went. The dips we had on the bad night were not great and we did not get them again for that fear, but agreed the next time we go, we will give them a try.  So we had the chicken sandwich again and it was up to par and delicious. We had the chips and they gave us this awesome Jalapeno dip which was delish (and they shared how they make it which made us happy!).  We also tried out their new cocktails which were awesome (try the greyhound!).  We cant wait to go again and try some of the newer items and retry some that we didn't have a great time with before. Every time we go back, they just get better!",

As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the parking is abysmal and the inside is small... and depending on time of day on the patio, you may be blinded by the setting sun.  I don't hold these things against Ingo's, just the LGO architects.  I've been here a few times, and am always pleased with the quality of the food.  There are two areas that could use improvement: Service, and beer.  The service is generally good, but sometimes is slow and they don't always get any custom requests done correctly (like not cutting the burger in half).  For Beer:  I would a) like to see a larger beer selection and more importantly b) stop serving the beer in a crappy plastic pilsner glass.  You might as well serve it to me in a sippy cup.  If you are afraid of people breaking glass, I don't know what to tell you?  But the small-ish size and the fact it is a lightweight plastic just seems odd.",

However, I have to give a fair review and say the food was subpar.  I had a cheeseburger and my girlfriend had the tuna burger.  She loved hers, but I thought mine was overly greasy and it fell apart as I ate it.  Not one of the better cheeseburgers I have had.  We also got the potato chips which were good and my girlfriend loved the sauce that came with it.

They have the best cocktail too-The Greyhound, made with a french grapefruit liqueur. It's casual, friendly and you can almost always get a table immediately. The people at LGO Hospitality know how to create a great restauramt.",

The interesting look and feel of this restaurant, coupled with the outdoor seating and the cooling weather enticed us to give their **tasty food** a try.   I ended up going with the Cale & Quinoa Salad, while my friend tried out the Mother Earth on Toast (vegetarian burger on toast, essentially). In preparation for an eventful evening, we both had their Single Cup Brew coffee... in all respects, it turned out to be just an average dining experience. The food wasn't overly exciting and the coffee was ordinary. To top it all off, our waitress (although attentive) seemed to be very distant and uninterested. Both my friend and I found it to be rather strange.  Nothing to seriously write home about, which was disappointing because the restaurant looked pretty trendy!",

There are just a few things that make me feel like this place will not be a regular on my restaurant rotation.  Ingo's has become a mecca for families with young children. That's okay but just go knowing that you will probably hear a few kids screaming or crying at any given moment. The shattered potatoes were good but needed more seasoning--they were basically fried potatoes with pretty minimal seasonings. And the  burger? It was good but I wasn't amazed. The kaiser roll got pretty soggy by the time I was done eating (and I'm a fast eater!). I think pretzel rolls or something else might hold up better.   Overall, Ingo's is a fun place. The food is decent and the vibe is fun. I'm sure I'll be back, especially for happy hour when certain wine is $3/glass! But the overall experience and food doesn't have me dying to go back too often.",

    "text": "Had a terrific burger here for dinner.  As for Ingo's as a whole, still not quite sure what to make of the place.  When you drive up to 40th St and Campbell, this tall cylindrical building on the northwest corner sticks out like a sore thumb.  I knew going in that it was an LGO restaurant (the same folks behind popular Arcadia neighborhood hangouts like La Grande Orange Grocery/Pizzeria and Chelsea's Kitchen), but the building is pretty unconventional even for LGO.  And as with the other LGO spots, parking is sparse at best.  Fortunately we got here at the right time on Sunday and got a spot.  There's actually quite a bit of seating outside the building.  Its shaded too, but it was 110 degrees today so we chose to eat inside.  First thing you notice walking inside is the tray of cookies right in front of the main entrance.  They're complimentary and taste great (basically the same complementary cookies you get at Chelsea's).  The rest of the interior mimics the building construction itself with the grill right in the center of the interior.  A circular counter surrounds the grill with waitresses in between you and the grill.  The menu is very limited, but I already knew I wanted a burger.  Specifically, I came for the Farmer's Daughter burger.  Dijon sauce, sauerkraut, and swiss cheese.  The toppings were great, but honestly the unique beef was what sold me on this burger.  Its a grass-fed, hormone-free beef from a free range family farm in Wisconsin.  I honestly don't actively seek hormone free or free range beef, but WOW this burger was unbelievably juicy.  I'm not sure why Ingo's seeks out this product, but boy am I glad they do.  I was a little weirded out that the burger didn't come with a side, but the burger was good enough that I forgot about it.  My only compliant about the burger would be that I wished it were bigger.  Total cost for the burger, a beer, plus tax and tip was $17.  The burger by itself was $9 which is a little steep for the portion I got (thus why I can't give this 5 stars), though I get that its a special type of beef that probably costs more.  We were in and out of this place in 20 minutes.  Staff was friendly and helped explain the menu to us.  It wasn't busy today, though I'm sure this place is nuts during the weekday lunch hour.  And I can definitely understand Yelpers' frustration with the parking situation.  If my burger hadn't been so awesome, I probably would've given this place 3 stars.  But the beef really is that good, so 4 stars it is.  Much of the rest of the menu is on the healthier (and cheaper) end so I'll do some more exploring next time I'm here.  But for the record, the Farmers Daughter is definitely among the Top 5 burgers I've had in the valley.",

Dipped in that jalapeno sauce, so good.  Also you can add a fried egg to any burger, and they offer fresh English muffins as an alternative bun, she suggested going this route with the standard cheeseburger.  The Crispy Chicken Sandwich came very highly recommended, a staff favorite. It had a golden brown crust and it looked friggin amazing.   Lots of people were ordering the kale salad, and it looked, well, it looked like a kale salad to be honest. Probably pretty bomb considering the frequency it was being ordered though.  The tuna sandwich was going out as much as the salads were, which I found a bit odd, but she said their Egg Salad Sandwich is one of the best sandwiches in the valley, and it's only sold for one hour a day...hot damn.  I had the Paris, Texas Burger. It was...wow...  The beef was unbelievably savory, cooked medium rare with incredible mouthfeel, juicy but not at all greasy. Pancetta was salty and perfectly crispy, bacon's better brother. Sharp cheddar cheese blanketed the beef, holding it all together and melding the flavors into umami heaven. The apple butter BBQ sauce is otherworldly, sweet but with this slight smoky flavor that just rounds it all out. The dill pickles chips gave a fresh & light crispness to each bite, and the fresh poppyseed buns were baked to perfection culminating in this amazing amalgamation of tastes and textures. A new flavor took center stage with each chew, and I must have made the family that sat next to us really uncomfortable with all the moaning and grunting I was making as I ate.   The waitress also gave us a little dish of their lacto-fermented jalapeno hot sauce and it took the flavors to another level.  Spicy-sweet-salty-savory-juicy-crisp-chewy-melty-glory.",

I could hardly resist eating them all in one go!          Dishes come out minimally with no frills or fuss. If you're looking for a special, their salad special is on a post it note. I decided to try their brown rice bowl and wasn't disappointed. Although the jalapeno was a little more fiery than I'd expected (which slowed me down a lot) the brown rice, pistachios and poached egg on top were a delicious combo!

    "text": "First, the star-reducing factors: Somewhat high prices and extremely tiny parking lot, but those factors are to be expected with an LGO restaurant I suppose!  Make use of their \"secret parking\" by their corporate office a couple minutes walk down the street, past the (chained up!) dermatologist office and dry cleaners.  I also find the servers here to not be as personable as they could be, and they spent time talking amongst each other instead of checking up on customers and filling empty drink glasses.  I've also had a waitress \"forget\" to take my mother's order!  Unfortunately, I think they have been hired based on looks and not on experience.  Star-bestowing factor: FOOD!  I've tried the amazingly delicious Paris, Texas burger and the chicken schnitzel sandwich.  The burger was fantastic, especially on an English muffin and with an egg on top.  The breading came off of the chicken when I had that, though it was still tasty.  Definitely not \"amazing\" like the burger though!  The smashed potato fries are fantastic, though I prefer them with ketchup.  The \"fries\" are like deep fried slices of baked potato, seasoned with sea salt and cracked pepper.  Don't forget to take a couple free salted chocolate chip cookies for dessert!  It's kind of a pain to get them yourself, and I think that the servers should consider offering a small plate of them to customers.  The servers don't even tell you about the cookies, much less help you get them out from under their enclosure as you use the tiny pair of tongs and hope said cookies don't slide off the provided napkins!  This goes back to my star-reducing \"decent but not great service\" factor.  Overall, decent enough service and really great food mean I will be back, but will have to be motivated to drive further past the more easily-accessible and better-serviced Zin Burger at Biltmore Fashion Park.",

    "text": "We are LGO frequenters and we watched as they built this place just across the street for a few months so I'm not sure why it has taken us this long to try it!  This past Sunday we met another couple for a late lunch around 2pm. Luckily there was plenty of parking spaces because as other regulars know, parking in this area during peak times can be a bit stressful.   The inside is cute but pretty small with seats at the bar and only a few tables. Since it was beautiful outside, we decided to sit out on the patio and they definitely had more seating outside, though the gravel was a bit of an odd chose for patio flooring. When sitting outside, you order at the window on the north side of building and then take your number to your table where they deliver it.  I ordered the Ingo burger without the bun, with the yuzu berry iced tea. My fiance got the Paris Texas burger and the other couple both got the cheeseburger. We also shared an order of the shattered potato chips. The tea came in a bottle and was really good, it did taste more like a green tea though and I doubt there are free refills but I didn't ask. I probably would have ordered a Diet Coke in a can when I saw someone else with one but didn't see it on their menu, only a Coke with cane sugar so it would have been nice to have it listed.   The cheeseburgers were delivered all at the same time and they were all really good. My fiance literally moaned every bite he took of his Texas burger. He said it was the best burger he's ever had. I had to try it after a comment like that and while good, I've had a few better so maybe he was just really hungry. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not the best ever in my opinion. The chips were really good and fresh and the accompanying dip was good too, different.   One other note, several people brought their dogs. I am a HUGE dog lover and would typically be a fan of being able to bring your dogs to a patio but the seats are pretty close to each other and the couple next to us had a long leash and I definitely felt like the dog was part of our lunch. Not something I'm into at a restaurant. They did try and watch him but it's still interrupting when the dog barked at other dogs or  when others petted the dog, you could see the hair flying in the breeze...enough to make me worry about getting it on my food and that's pretty gross.   All in all, I would come back here on a nice day and enjoy the patio and hope only shed free dogs were around.",

Got the potato chips (the jalapeno salsa stuff was to die for) the avocado toast which was amazing and one of the burgers. Everything was so good! To top it all off we got pistachio ice cream for dessert. It was the perfect way to end the meal.   I love this place and will definitely be back again! It's the perfect place to sit outside and enjoy the (now cooling) weather and have some delicious food! 10 for 10 would recommend!",

The only down side is that they do not have a whole lot of seating inside the restaurant.  But they do have tables outside.    The reason why this place is my favorite burger joint is because of the Ingo Burger.  It has sauerkraut, Dijon sauce and to top it off I got it on a English Muffin.    Let's just say I will totally be coming back here all the time.",

I was shocked that it was a restaurant going in this tiny little round building. I finally tried it a week an half ago and I couldn't have been more rewarded for my wait. I keep having to update my fav burgers in Phoenix and I have to say it. Ingos is it!! The Stand and Delux have been knocked down the list.   Backing it up this way -  Bun - Ingo's (Light and perfect size) Meat - Ingo's (Seasoned right, juicy and medium rare) Sauce - Ingo's (Whatever the hell it is it's delicious!) Fries/Potato Chips - Ingo's (These PC are something else. Worth the trip alone) Service - Ingo's (Great personable service. Goes a long, long way)  La Grande Hospitality has done it again. Another great concept restaurant that was thought out, from the space to the menu. There are a lot of conceptual restaurant groups in town and they usually fall short. Good job LGO, when do you open The Luggage Room here?",

Ingo's is a super cute corner cafe, with nice patio seating that I wish I could've enjoyed today, had I brought another sweater with me. Playlist is mellow and feel-good, and service was pleasant.  It was Happy Hour, so my 2 cocktails were only $6 each. The Ingo's Greyhound is a pretty pink drink with a great grapefruit flavor. Their moscow mule tasted quite unique because of the rather strong muddled ginger. It sort of worked for me, but I don't imagine it would for the usual mule drinker. Hubby had the Ska Brewery Modus Hoperandi IPA for $5.  Our food was BANGIN'! Hubby had the Paris Texas Cheeseburger and I had the Crispy Chicken Sammy ($8.50 whaaaattt). Don't let the sandwich sizes fool you! Both were so juicy and flavorful, you'll be comfortably satisfied at the end of the meal. Oh, and those thick-cut potato chips with ranch and salsa verde dips are awesome to share and start with.",

I had the chicken sandwich \"Adam and Eve\" style, which is sans bread.  The sandwich was tasty but small.  Had chips on the side, - they do a great job with the chips.  Service was lackluster, and here is what kills a star for me.  They use the mobile devices to run your card right at the table, then the tip amounts are automatically calculated, so you cannot decide what amount to give apart from their pre-set tip amounts.  Doing this while the server is standing over you is uncomfortable - especially when the service was as bad as it was.  Despite that Ingo's is a short walk from home, I think I'll pass in the future.",

Lunch today...deviled eggs, 1/2 order of smashed chips, 1/2 order avocado toast, 1/2 order black bean burger, tiny sample of the pistachio and vanilla soft serve gelato. Pro Tip: go with a friend so getting 1/2 orders of more things is an option.   I enjoy a good picnic deviled egg as much as anyone, but the deviled eggs here are not your momma's picnic deviled egg. Goat cheese blended with the yolk. Who thinks of these things? It's worth coming here for if you ordered nothing else. They are amazing. 3 half-eggs to an order.  The chicken Sammy, fish sandwich and black bean burger all share the same light, delicious toasted bun. Can't go wrong with any of the 3 and I can't wait to go back to try those buns with a burger in between. Smashed chips are fantastic and a 1/2 order is plenty for two to share. Avocado toast is loaded with cheese and tomatoes and is crazy good.   Soft serve gelato? Yes, please. Every. Time. Thanks to Kent for the samples and for overseeing a fantastic kitchen and menu. You could easily drive past this place and miss it. Don't miss it. Not many places have me walking out and trying to think about how soon I can get back. Wish there was something close this good and innovative back home in Dallas.",

    "text": "So, I tried the White Fish Club Sandwich and Fresh Shattered Potato Chips. All ordered ahead and brought to the car curbside.  Atmosphere (4): While small inside, I definitely appreciate the ability for drive-up service when you call ahead. There are also a few tables outside to enjoy your food. My only issue is the limited parking. Whether you are eating onsite or taking out, the parking is limited in their lot. I believe you can park across the street at a sister property (LaGrande Orange I believe).  Food (4): The fish sandwich was different than any other I've had in that it wasn't cod or some other pieced together fish. It was flaky and the crust was crispy and well seasoned. I opted for both the lebni AND Ingo's hot sauce, which I dipped my chips in both and it was damn good. I even poured some of the Ingo's hot sauce on my fish sandwich for some extra added flavor (excellent choice). I was expecting a little more flavor to the chips. I did not taste any sea salt or pepper (there was plenty of green shrubbery though).   Service (4): I used drive-up service, not realizing that they would come to the car. After hopping out and heading to the window to pick-up my order, the server told me that they would kindly bring my order to my car. (SCORE!)  Price (4): Prices were fair, $13.25 (plus tax) for a fish sandwich and chips (or fries, whatever you want to call them). The amount of food provided left me full and satisfied.   Overall, I would frequent Ingo's, especially for the fish sandwich. They have quite a few delicious looking items on their menu and they don't have too much so, it's not hard to find a selection. Next time I'll try their deviled eggs (who doesn't love a good deviled egg).  Enjoy.",

    "text": "Probably closer to 3 1/2 stars. I came here last night on a whim for dinner. The weather was perfect for sitting on the patio so we grabbed one of the few tables that were left and took a look at the menu. This place is small, and markets itself as a food stand with table seating. I didn't get a chance to look inside but the patio was cute and relaxing. Tables were a little tight but I enjoyed listening to our neighbors on what appeared to be a 1st tinder date.   For a drink I went with the Ingo's greyhound and my date had a Moscow mule. I ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer and they came right away. Almost too fast, and as some others have stated they were pretty heavy on the mustard. For my taste there was also a little bit too much yolk per bite. We also got the potato chips which were pretty dang tasty. They were served with two dipping sauces, one was sour cream-based and the other was a weird green hot sauce. The hot sauce was good but it didn't seem to go well with the chips.   Just an FYI the menu is pretty limited, but done well. For entrees we ordered the cheeseburger and fish sandwich. My cheeseburger came out perfect medium pink and the poppyseed bun was to die for! The pickles were crunchy and overall it was a solid burger. The real stand out for me though was the fish sandwich. Lightly battered and fried, served with tangy tartar sauce and that amazing bun. The breading on the fish was very light but also very filling (and let's be real fried fish is way better than grilled).   In short, good food, service, and drinks. Not blow your mind amazing but I would recommend it if you're in the area.",

    "text": "I never knew this place was right across the Postino's and LGO!! How I got here was due to eating at a sister restaurant, Chelsea's Kitchen. I received a certificate to dine in and I finally made it a point to come in for a bite or two. Today I came in for a super late lunch - at 4:30pm-  or you could call it an early dinner. Parking lot was a bit sparse but so is the rest of the other restaurants' parking. (Would be such a pain but luckily we came at such an odd time!)   I accidentally walked in the employee door where the staff forgave me and allowed me to enter. Otherwise, you should enter at the front double doors facing the street.  There are tables outside with heat lamps and then an inside bar that can seat about 16ish or so. 4 of us chose to sit inside since it was bitter cold outside. The area was shaped in a circular shape so that patrons can view the chefs. 2 chefs were working behind the somewhat covered kitchen while a couple staff members (maybe one was the owner) took orders and held the fort indoors.   The menu was limited as the space. Everything is a la carte style. I started off with drip coffee with cream and sugar to fend off the cold weather. Then I tried the freshly cut and cooked seasoned potato chips with skin-on with a sour cream-like sauce on top. Chomp chomp! Then I tried the Ingo's Cheeseburger made with grass fed beef, black creek cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mayo, dill pickle in between soft brioche bread. They cook their patties medium pink but of course you may choose to alter the making of that. This was quite juicy and delicious. The \"No.1 Tuna Burger\" was a tuna party, lettuce, avocado and a Siracha-mayo sauce (to give it the kick) in between a pillowy brioche bread. This actually seemed like a No.2 burger compared  to the Ingo's Cheeseburger just because it didn't seem as flavorful although both were juicy.   I was getting quite full but had to get something sweet so ordered a couple sea salt chocolate chip cookies. Found out that those were complimentary! Yummy for a Cookie Monsterish chick like me. My eyes became not full but my stomach was.  I ate 2 small cookies with the rest of my coffee.   The server was energetic and always checked how we were doing. Overall I enjoyed the freshly made meals and the comp cookies. I also saw that they make fresh juices too! I'll have to give that a try for next time! They have happy hour drinks from 11am to 7pm weekdays. Cheers!",

It's a cozy little spot, reminiscent of the classic bell ringing diner where your waitress stands in front of you at a counter pouring a fresh cup of coffee and the chef is behind the grill cooking away, but in a totally updated and refined way. The menu is simple classic American but with a twist and every entree is delicious! I commented to my wife at home that the chicken sandwich is the best I've ever had! Who would think to put a thinly sliced green apple and pickle in a superbly fried crispy chicken sandwich. The resulting balance is culinary perfection even if it's something so simple. Try it out you won't regret it!",

Like I've probably been 30 times and they've never gotten an order right. Tonight featured a kids meal missing it's chips and veggies, burned chips for me and no sauces which totally make the experience. And it was curbside and I sat for a good five minutes before walking up to the window myself because nobody was coming out to help me. I called to let them know so they could hopefully pay more attention to making their order correct and the \"manager\" who is also a cook gets on the phone and says \"so do you want free stuff now or free stuff later?\" WHAT?! I just want a correct order thank you. Lack of any sense of class. Don't go, when LGO across the street has an even better burger and fries or drive a little further and go to in'n'out foods about the same.",

We finally got around to coming back and we're super pleased with the service... great friendly staff (once again) and super helpful on explaining the menu. We ordered the chips again... jeez! This recipe is amazing!! The sauces to dip in are equally as amazing. I then got the cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the Paris burger with egg. He was super excited about his. Mine was a simple cheeseburger (just how I like it) but very comparable to other burgers. I'll be back for a drink and the chips!! Thanks again for the management team, owner, and staff! Great customer service.   OLD REVIEW: Okay, I wanted to be a huge fan of this place... it's walking distance from my work and house, it uses grass fed beef, and I LOVE locally owned restaurants. We ordered the devil eggs, chips, Paris burger, and chicken sandwich. Devil eggs were great, got us on a good start. Chips were the best part of the meal! Amazing! I didn't try the burger but I heard it was \"good\". The chicken sandwich had no flavor and was lathered in grease... the apple was a nice touch but it needed more flavor to the sandwich to make it better.",

We really enjoyed the outside seating. Another cool plus is the happy hour from 11-7pm Monday - Friday. The only gripe is the music selection.  They intentionally skipped through any hip-hop songs. Kendrick, Chance, DJ Khaled, etc. The alternatives were Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris. We visited Portland in March and remember walking down the street and hearing Gucci Mane in a random sandwich shop. Unsurprisingly we chose to eat there. We walked by a random brewery and heard A Tribe Called Quest and chose to eat there too.  I guess we still have a ways to go in AZ when it comes to that musical diversity.  This problem isn't exclusive to Ingo's and is something you see in most of our favorite spots in PHX. Just something to think about.",

First off, the fish on the fish sandwich was perfect and very moist & flaky. The dipping sauces with the fries are amazing, especially the jalapeno one.  Lastly, that's some of the best lemonade I've had since I was a kid. Really, tart, lots of pulp. Yum!",

    "text": "I can't believe it's taking me this long to write this review, but better late than never!   Listen to whatever others day and try the egg salad, but show up between 11 and 12 because they only offer it during that short hour. Even if you think, \"I don't even like egg salad,\" still get it. I was one of those... \"but I don't even like egg salad\" people and then I tried their version and was blown away. This isn't your typical egg salad sandwich. If they didn't put mayo on it, I would almost call it a breakfast sandwich with a twist. The eggs are cooked fresh for each order and they are combined with their delicious mayo sauce and placed on crispy yet fluffy bread. Make sure you order it with the pancetta if you like a little meat. It's crispy and salty and yummy!  Besides the egg salad, I have also enjoyed the tuna sandwich and cheeseburger. I was pleasantly surprised with the tuna sandwich because it was crispy and accompanied by an aoili and avocado. I don't typically order tuna but I was glad I switched my routine. The cheeseburger had the delicious LGO touch and the meat was perfectly cooked. You really can't go wrong with any food here. The Kale salad is a great side to accompany the meal. I only wish they had french fries on the menu. Their homemade chips are delicious but I am more of a french fries kind of girl.  This is a great location to enjoy lunch on the patio, but if it's too hot, then you can sit inside and watch them make your food which is really fun! They also have a walk-up window where you can place an order to go.   If you can't find parking, head north on 40th street and follow the signs to additional LGO parking.",

I wish they had a large selection of beer, wine, and drinks. :(   Burgers are the best, hands down. If you go, go for the burgers!

My favorite side to get is the potato crisps with that amazing dip - definitely worth adding to your meal. If you're not into beef, my favorite is the tuna burger. It's nice and spicy but not overwhelming, and the tuna doesn't get lost in the sauce. The blush sangria is on point, too!",

While many places act put off, we were never rushed and were given quite good service.  Thank you!  INGO's is located across from LGO and gives you another option if the waits are too long across the street.  We ordered the deviled eggs (yum!) and chips (also yum!) as appetizers.  Definitely get these starters - they rocked!  I had the kale/quinoa salad with a tuna patty.  Next time, I'd opt out of the fish addition, but this salad was quite tasty and will remind you of LGO's salad, if you've had that.  My friend ordered the brown rice bowl, which I would consider for next time.  Very rich and hearty.  I want to make these meals at home every day!  The boys got the white fish club sandwiches and were quite happy with their choices.  All food was devoured quickly!  We finished with ice cream cookie sandwiches.  Not the best desert ever, but a nice, sweet, finish.    We'll definitely be back!",

Three of us went for the first time around dinner time. The Food was really amazing. In my opinion sizes are perfect; however, that is the only one thing me and my boyfriend disagreed on as he thought that portions are bit small....No surprise there...hahhaha  We ordered their popular chips and I do not know if I like chips or dip more! These amazing chips were Crispy, crunchy, and served with a lemony tazaki kind of dip (not sure what exactly it was but - it's super legit!) Ketchup who?     For dinner me and my friend ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had a Paris, Texas burger of course. I was lucky to try both as me and him split ours....Crispy chicken was amazing, the spicy aioli they use is out of this world. The chicken was crispy but yet nice and tender at the same time. I loved the apples and dill pickle combination in sandwich as well. Burger was good as well but I am not big on red meet so I am not as good judge on that. However, I can say my boyfriend liked it a lot.   The only thing I did not like is the fact that they served food and drinks in plastic ware. Food in plastic didn't bother me as much as drinks did. For example, the beer would have been fresher in a cold glass as opposed to a plastic cup. But perhaps that is just me....  Outside seating area is amazing....Overlooking Campbell avenue with beautiful lighting outside was great! Service was amazing as well. The fact that their chef came out and asked how the food was, is kind of place I would for sure go back too.   Everyone there was really nice and friendly and I will for sure go back!",

This time my friend had the spinach apple salad and I had the bison goat cheese salad.  The portion was just right, both were delicious esp the salad dressing for the spinach apple salad! The owners of LGO somehow has the magic 8 ball dailed into the right frequency to create an ever lasting environment each time. When I am sitting out on the patio enjoying my food and drinks, I feel transported to a space and time that is of the moment not connected to any human created contraption such as the clock.

Our main complaint with him is although he doesn't ever actually make the food, once it's set out for the waitresses to grab and serve it, he'll randomly come by and just touch the food for no reason. It's very bizarre. He basically just walks by and \"taps\" your burger buns like he's hitting bongo drums. That might be just a weird little tic that one could overlook if his hands were clean. Unfortunately my party and I once watched him take out the trash, then, without washing his hands, walk right over and start doing his \"burger bun tapping.\" If you don't have to touch the food, don't touch the food. And if you're going to touch the food for no reason, please wash your hands before you do it.  That being said, I personally love the Farmer's Daughter burger. That with a individually brewed ice tea really is great on a hot day. It's a fun little spot and if you don't mind sitting at the counter with you friends, it can be great for a quick lunch.  I'm excited for the fall when sitting outside on the patio won't be horrible and then the seating will effectively more than double. I come here probably one a week for a bite, and hope you'll check it out.",

    "text": "Late afternoon Sunday Companion and I had different desires.  She wanted a Red Bull and a pack of Marlboro Lights.  I wanted a cheese burger. We went into Ingo's , which I thought was a combination of a \"Stop & Go\" convenience store and \"In & Out\" Burgers.   We were greeted by a blonde Jasmine or Jessica or some other \"J\" name who is a testament as to why skinny jeans were invented.  Shunning the outdoor patio area due to chill, we sauntered inside to the close quarters of a horseshoe bar/counter.  The bar had a close full view of the kitchen staff and those who get squeamish at the sight of tattoos and stretching earrings, sit outside. An interesting \"waiting area\" are painted numbered footprints on the floor, which reminded me of the lineup I stood in at the County Jail.  But I digress, onto the food.  Quality craft beers are served cold and in clear plastic solo cups.  (Disappointing they were not in the vintage Red Solo Cup to preserve my youth and bring back the \"Keg Party\" feel\".  If Management adopts the color, thank me.)  This is a burger place and it is aptly described as such.  The classic cheeseburger was a brilliant in its simplicity and served on a quality white bun (thank you for shunning the over used pretzel bun).  The violently named \"Fresh Shattered Potato Chips\" were a perfect compliment and remained hot during the meal.  Adjourning to the patio for an apres-beer, Companion walked up the block to retrieve her cigarettes.  Ingo's closes at 9, so I was asked to leave.  If you see Companion, please tell her she owes me for dinner.  I will gladly meet her at Ingo's.",

    "text": "The signage for this restaurant is minimal, but you can't miss the cute little round building on the corner lot with outside seating. Even at 3pm, the place had quite a few patrons and was gearing up for a busy evening. We had an exceptional waitress and also spoke with the manager who was also quite friendly. Our waitress actually comped an order of deviled eggs and shattered potatoes (of which they are know for).  We ordered the deviled eggs and Texas Paris burger. Being a southern girl, I like to think that I know deviled eggs. While I appreciate their creativity with the eggs, I thought the goat cheese was a little too strong (reasoning for a four). If you are a fan of mustard, goat cheese, and dill then these are for you. If not, then steer away.  The burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, flavorful, and appropriately sized. I'm a sucker for bbq sauce on burgers.   Like I said, we didn't order the potatoes but I would recommend them. They are topped with a refreshing yogurt sauce and served with fermented jalapeno sauce on the side. It might sound a little gross to some, but that green sauce is dynamite!  And last, but not least the cookies are free (if I had a microphone I would drop it)!",

    "text": "We stopped by on a rainy Saturday--it was great timing --we were able to sit down at the counter immediately.  We ordered the chips to start.  We are a family who likes our fried foods well done or extra crispy---these did not disappoint and the dip they come with is fantastic.  We all ordered burgers.  They are very good--but I know now that I will order a little differently next time--they were a little too pink for my tastes--not their fault--they were exactly as they were described on the menu. next time I will order a little more well done--which will also give a chance for the cheese to melt a little more.  We shared a couple of ice cream sandwiches (which were given to us for free for a little tiny mix up on ordering--how cool is that--what great service)  as the rain stopped it started to fill up.  by the way the building is great looking--so simple, but there is something sublime about it and loved the McIntosh vintage amplifier--spitting out the tunes.    Will definitely be back to sample some more of the menu.",

Every bite of all of it was exceptional. The salads I had were super fresh and the service staff was all smiles. I also tried their cold brewed green tea tonight. Yummm. I got to watch an amazing sunset from their awesome patio in the perfect weather. I'm not sure how long this place has been open, but they are off to a fantastic start for me.   I'll be back!",

The  only reason why I don't give ''tis place 5stars is the beer selection .  The Stone polder has too much bite,  you need something more drinkable and light.  Scottsdale Blond, or Orange Papago.",

    "text": "Ok, I'm a lover of Le Grande Orange and this concept restaurant for LGO meets, no exceeds, the exceptional food quality I've come to expect from LGO. INGO may be small on size but don't let that fool you. Their food has BIG flavors! So I started with the shattered potato chips. Crispy, crunchy, and served with a lemony tazaki like dip (whatever it was- it's super tasty!) no need for ketchup for these chips! Then to the grassfed beef burgers. When they say cooked and served with pink - that isn't a lie. BUT they are so juicy and delicious. I has the Paris TX burger- a delicious blend of BBQ sauce, pancetta, aged cheddar, and pickles. Ok, so I am usually not a fan of pickles on my burger... But these aren't your usual salty, vinegary, overly dill pickles. They make them fresh and they are the perfect blend of dill and sweetness with the crunch of a fresh cucumber and they compliment the burger amazingly. Overall 5 star food for a 3 star price!  Now I put the food first because let's be honest - that's why you review a restaurant!  But the atmosphere is worth mentioning. Indoor and outdoor seating with an open kitchen and bistro lights. Driven by on a Saturday and it seems like a great hangout. If you arent in the mood for an amazing LGO pizza but rather a juicy burger - cross the street and enjoy INGO!!!!",

I had higher expectations because of its connection to LGO, and it's a burger place.   The lemonade was extremely tart for my liking (and the three others at my table). I added a lot of water to calm it down.   The concept is cool, but I think it needs a little more work to get it right. I will return, at least because happy hour sounds like fun: 11-6pm or something, Tues-Fri is $3 beer, cocktails and sangria!",

Ingos was great, especially the young man Roy, or maybe it was Troy, or Tom. He helped me a lot especially picking the right cheese. I like cheese quite a bit. I love it. My favorite is provolone, but sometimes it changes. A month ago it was Swiss. They are all so good. One day maybe I can make my own new type of great cheese. But sometimes our dreams don't become reality even with really hard work. My parents never really had a lot of cheese growing up so maybe my love stemmed from that. Thanks again Roy (Troy, Tom?) Go to ingos and enjoy the great food and friendly service. I would go back again anytime and maybe even make some friends there or try new types of cheese. Thank you so much for everything.",
