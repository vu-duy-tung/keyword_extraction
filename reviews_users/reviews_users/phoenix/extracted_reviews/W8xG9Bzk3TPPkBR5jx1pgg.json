    "text": "We came here because my friend loves rooftop bars and our friend suggested we check this place out. I guess rooftop bars in Cali are very different then in AZ because we were very let down. I'll break it down as simply as possible.   Pros: Quiet- Don't have to shout to be heard. Quick service Light up menus- LIGHT UP MENUS! So cool.  Cons: Over priced drinks- Payed like $60 for 3 drinks. Ouch! Even in Cali that would be crazy. \"Specialty\" drinks- Our waitress assured us this is what they are known for. The drinks had liquors I had never heard of before, so I asked what would be the closest to rum. The suggestion she made sounded great but when it came it was blech in my mouth. It tasted of just straight up ginger. There was no notes of any alcohol, or pleasant flavors. I decided to give it another try and got a drink that claimed to have pineapple, orange, and other flavors I like. When it came it tasted like I was drinking cooking sherry. Where was the pineapple? The oranges? NOTHING! Gross, gross drinks.  cougar/creeper town- When we arrived it was empty. By the time we were going to leave I needed to use the restroom. I had to push my way through a crowd of people at least twice my own age. The dance floor was full of just older people. This place is definitely not the place for the younger crowd.   I will keep away from this place like the plague to save my taste buds and my wallet.",

We became a party of 7, continuously ordering drinks for 3 hours...Only to have an employee come by our section and put a sign on the table indicating it \"Reserved\", while we're there.  She then came by a few minutes later and told us we had to get up from our section and stand somewhere else unless we ordered a bottle!!  They wanted the section free in case anyone showed up and was willing to order a bottle-otherwise, it would sit empty.  What kind of \"business\" does that to paying customers??!!  We live within walking distance and frequent a number of the places there.  Will NEVER go back there...EVER!!!!  And I let everyone I know and meet what occurred.  Go to KAZIMER across the street.

If you're looking to get a vodka soda or something to that degree you may want to try something out of your comfort zone and go with their specialty cocktails.  It's got great outdoor and indoor seating for groups and one-on-one type convo which is great.  Days for being busy and energetic are hit and miss but it's more of a place to enjoy the people your with and maybe starting light conversation with a fellow patron.  Everyone is always very polite, professional and knowledable.  They also have a private room for rent for private parties which is great as well.  Always my go to for any type of classy or casual occassion.",

    "text": "Never book a party here!!!   I have to first say that the waitstaff and bartender who worked our party were great, but the party planner is an idiot!  Our party was suppose to be from 7 to 10 on the patio.  We were told that they opened at 6 so we showed up at 6:30 set up for our party only to find that they had booked another party on the patio the same day from 3 to 7. (This is kind of funny since we asked to use the inside party room and were told we couldn't because there was a party there starting at 10.)   We had no time to set up before the birthday girl arrived and had to fight to get the DJ from the previous party to leave so that would could finally set up. Also they were suppose to \"rope off\" part of the patio for our party, but they had nothing (not even a sign) to indicate that it was a private party so we had people eating our food and sitting with our party (can't really blame them since they had no idea it was a private party).  The food was mediocre and they had no lighting on the food tables so you couldn't even see what there was which I think lead to most of the food going to waste.   Luckily, like I said the waitstaff and bartender were great, so we manage to have a good time despite the stressful way the night started.",

    "text": "We were excited to Casablanca for date night, as we loved it when it was the Estate House. We arrived a bit early for our 7:30pm reservations and were led outside, past all of the cozy seats inside. I thought it odd we weren't asked for a preference.   But wait--it got worse. We were also taken past all of the cozy couches outside facing the movie playing and seated at this strange area way in the back. Between our two chairs, which overlooked the street, we had a giant heater and small table (in May). So much for date night. (The light-up menus are totally cool, though the selection is small.)  But wait--it still gets worse. Apparently our corner was the smoking area (!?), so they actually seated me, a severe asthmatic, in the middle of it. Thanks.  We ordered a crab dip, the sliders and the tacos. While waiting, we did get our well-mixed drinks. But then our waiter totally disappeared. After 35 minutes a water guy apologized for our slow food service. After 45 minutes it finally appeared. The two pork dishes were ok--but served totally lukewarm. The tacos were beautifully plated; the limes even had perfect grill marks on them. But couldn't they put that much care into getting me my damn food in a timely manner? While it's still hot? We didn't care for the crab dip, but that could be a personal thing. The plantain chips were yummy.  The final rub came with the service. Our waiter literally never came back after taking our order. When we decided we had enough, we actually went inside and stood at the empty bar and asked for our tab. Interestingly, no one thought that was odd.  So there we go. Bad service, mediocre food. We won't be back.",

    "text": "Casablanca. With a name like that you expect great things. What comes to mind for me is the movie, which could very easily go down as one of the top ten films of all time. Casablanca might go down as one of my top ten worst dining/going out experiences of all time, so I guess there is SOME similarity? That's stretching it...  I am going to relate my experience here to the early stages of dating. You meet the guy and the first impression is fantastic. You even think \"Oh my gosh, maybe he's THE ONE!\" and you can't wait to spend time with them. Maybe you meet for drinks for the first date, the guy was late, but you have delish drinks and great convo. You can't wait for a second date. Second date, you go to dinner. the food takes almost an hour to come out and is awful but you don't want to be a debbie downer and say anything. You pick at it in awkward silence as suddenly the glamour of what could have been has worn off and you realize you don't have much to say to this guy. But hey, maybe it was an \"off\" night. Then the guy pulls the whole \"I forgot my wallet\" act and you are stuck with the bill for something you didn't even enjoy in the first place. On top of that, there are items on the bill you didn't even order, but you just want to get the heck out of there so you pay. There are lots of apologies, he still tries to kiss you, and you leave irritated and pissed off wishing you had those two hours back, BUT that musician at the restaurant was super hot. Hmmm, wonder if he is single?   Casablanca looks great and sends out a great vibe. I was initially excited we were kicking off the evening there. Then to discover they weren't ready for our group (and they had weeks of notice) and made us stand around while they pushed tables together, etc. AWKWARD. The light up menus and drinks were fun and began to turn things around for me. I LOVED their seasonal drink and the Sophia bubbly. Then the food came (literally after an hour of us ordering it, I don't think most realized this otherwise we all probably would have been disgruntled a lot sooner) The food is a JOKE. The cheese and meat plate, all I could think was \"WTF?\" It was pathetic. We all had the thought about Postino being way better. But to be honest, I can't even help you understand how bad it was. The fact that a classy Scottsdale joint would serve that to their patrons (with a $25 price tag) and think people will be okay with it blows my mind. Tiny pieces of cheese. Pre packaged, presliced salami. Crackers I can find at Safeway. The hummus, also pathetic. It should be called the tzatziki plate. And we were given maybe three pieces of actual pita and told they were going to charge us for more. WOW. The blue cheese olives were the only thing I found yum, unique and not disappointing.   Now we get to the fun part. The god awful service. Some girls got there late so I decided to hunt down our server so they could order a drink before we left. I was wandering for five minutes (and the place is not very big) before someone FINALLY asked if I needed help. I don't blame our server for this at all. This is management and the event coordinator's fault. (Oh, and the event coordinator, I'd like to know what exactly her job is. She greeted us, said she'd be back to get us a round of drinks and was never to be found again. It wasn't that busy nor did it look like there were any other large groups there) The manager finally came out as if to our rescue and made things worse. I would rather have dealt with the newbie server and walked her through it patiently. Instead it took us 30 minutes to sort out the bill, which was separated into eight difference checks (when we had asked that three of us get put on one to \"make it easy\", we were charged for items we didn't order, and even when they \"fixed\" it there were errors but we just rolled with it because we so desparately wanted to leave.   Luckily we went to Mabel's after which was a 5 star experience so the night was quickly redeemed and we had a BLAST.   The ONLY reason this place gets two stars instead of one: The entertainment was AMAZING and the place has potential to be better. I really hope they get their act together.",

It's also not obvious where you should park....there are 3 options:  1 - Street parking.  However, arrive at happy hour and you'll be circling around forever trying to find a spot.  2 - Parking lot.  There are a few small parking lots around the area.  Best bet if you want to self park.  Just be careful you're not in a tow zone for a building that only allows you to park there if you go into one of their businesses.  3 - Valet lot.  There's a valet parking service that on the opposite corner of this place.  It will cost you $$$.  Once you get inside the place, it's a cool joint.  They have live music outside on the patio and if the weather is great, it will be packed out there.  The vibe inside is pretty cool too....it's dark, which I like.  I don't like lounges that are well lit....to me, that's not a lounge experience.  The food is pretty good too.  The Better Half and I shared the Short Rib Tacos ($13), Jerk Pork Sliders ($10), Pita & Hummus ($9), and the Edamame ($6).  The Short Rib Tacos were fantastic and my favorite out of the bunch.  The Sliders were good too.  The Pita & Hummus and Edamame were nice appetizers to get us started.    Return Factor - 85%",

I made a reservation for last night at Casablanca and talked personally to the manager a  month ago. I specifically asked \"Do you have food?\" because I had only been there for drinks and wasn't sure. I was reassured by the manager that yes, they did have food no worries.   Well we showed us last night, 30 hungry people. NO FOOD. The bartender told us that their chef had quit last week. Okay so stuff happens, on to plan B. I went downstairs to arrange for food from The Herb Box. I talked to the manager there. He told me that Casablanca hasn't had food for TWO YEARS!!! Yep the manager LIED to me.  We had great service and the outside patio is superb. But the fact that they blatantly lie to their customers is unreal. Wow. Who does that?",

The lobster and cheese sandwich and the wild boar sliders are an amazing partner to the many many local beers on tap.   The atmosphere was very friendly and comfortable. This lounge is good whether you're in a large group of 12, or just an intimate group of 2, there is a place for everyone.   Great bands, great music, and great staff. I'm not a local to Scottsdale, but I will always drop in and have a great time here!",

They had a band on the inside & a DJ (playing hip hop) on the outside. Who knew so many white people loved rap & hip hop (it was awesome to see)? The patio seating was the best & the staff was amazing. The server took our orders & returned quickly. He even started our cigars. The only downside is they DO NOT HAVE FOOD! Make sure you eat before you go here. That atmosphere was amazing, surrounded by cool people. It was a great way to close out the night (pictures attached).",

Once we got there they 'apologized' but they don't serve food anymore. No accommodations for maybe some drinks to make up for the inconvenience. They indicated that they had to let their chef go and did not give a courtesy call to let us know. We had friends came out  for a special event and they traveled from tempe which made me look like so improper. So inconvenient. When I called to talk to the Manager she was very sarcastic to me and said to me \" I can keep my reservation and I will go in the  kitchen and make  your food for you \" So rude!! Stay clear of this place!  ***In response to your email Samantha whom made the booking my friend she has email confirmation and text messages to prove that reservations made and she spoke with Ashley to make the reservation, there was no communication, there was a lack of care for the customer and owning up the mistake while we were present. Samantha stated she will be in touch with the manager.***",

    "text": "I had my B'Day party at this establishment Sat the 19th. We had a party of 12. First of all let me state that I heard abt this place on the radio 104.3. So I yelped for the reviews and checked the website.   The website indicated that they opened at 6:00 pm. Well we got there early to get seats. We found out that they do not open till 8:00 pm. The gentleman at the door indicated that 8:00 pm are the summer hours. This should have been on their website. The marketing on the radio was incorrect as well strike one.  Secondly: Once we got in and found seats for my party of 12 we tried to order snacks. The website indicated that they served a light fare of munchies. Well... No munchies at all! No food served. So my girlfriend and I walked to the Mexican restaurant on the corner to get snacks.   You may Say you should have called. Well I did call and left a mssg telling someone in the cloud that I was having a party their and wanted to reserve a space. To date I never received a call back. Strike two  Thirdly: I ordered a strawberry type of drink it was delicious my friend ordered a Raspberry Martini again delicious. We tried to order another round and a different waitress said we do not serve that kind of drink. We looked at each other and told the waitress we just order those drinks and wanted another round so you are not familiar with your own menu. Strike three  We wanted to speak to a mgr or better yet the owner but nobody knew who they were working for. Can you say strike four just for GP  Then the website indicated that there are two patios one facing old town Scottsdale the other facing Camelback Mtn. This is not True. If one of the patios face Camelback the other buildings are blocking the Mtn. Strike five  It was advertised on the radio 104.3 that there is reserved seating with bottle Svc started at $100.00. Well when we inquired about this service they indicated that this service started at $150.00. Strike six  Ok you may say darn what a bummer. Well I took my party with me so in-spite  of the False advertisement, outdated website and waitresses that did not have a clue over all we all had a great time.   The DJ was awesome and the band.....all I can say is wow. The keyboard player Josh Harley was awesome....the lead singer I met in the elevator coming into the establishment could sing to me anytime and everyday just loved loved loved them.  Overall I would not recommend this place. I recommend that you have dinner first. This is not a pickup place. If you bring your own party you will have fun. Please take heed to the six strikes that NEED TO BE RESOLVED.",

I then went on a hike to find another server. I told her I asked for a menu and never received one. She said \"ok\" and walked away. Incredibly rude! Needless to say I never got to eat. Oh and the kicker?! In her total was 2 bottles of champagne. NEVER received!!! How do you advertise champagne for the new year. Charge for it and never deliver. UNACCEPTABLE!

The venue is pretty dark and sultry, but sexy. On this particular Saturday night, there was a Jazz musician and he was GOOD! But, it shouldn't have been so loud because of the smaller space, Jazz genre, and being a lounge... you want to converse without shouting/lip-reading, right? Sigh. Maybe I have aging dog ears, but some notes he hit truly pained me, causing me to utterly wince, and this isn't a pleasant experience. But he was talented and had passion!  We only stayed for 1 round of drinks and decided that due to the noise level, we would relocate to a quieter place to eat and shoot the shit. While we were there, menu items/drinks looked appealing and service was friendly and quick. ** NOTE: I liked that they fully considered how dark their venue is and made their menus automatically illuminate so you can read food/drink selections. Cool touch! I'd definitely try this venue again!",

The cocktails were good and we ordered them during their happy hour. When it came time to pay our bill we were presented an iPad and didn't look closely at the itemized bill. We selected the 15% check box for the tip as the service was good but we weren't happy with the food or wine. I requested to have a receipt emailed to me and after seeing it after we left I was shocked at the total. We didn't get happy hour pricing on our cocktails as promised and our tip was now at 20%. A $15-$20 dollar bottle of house wine was listed on our bill at $45. This inflated price was obviously used to increase the overall total check to increase their tip. Based on what our overall bill with the Groupon amount included, we were charged a $20 tip for a $38 bar bill. After calling the restaurant to discuss and several emails, Cody the manager has failed to address my concern.",

    "text": "The Casablanca is officially my new favorite place in Old Town Scottsdale!  Wanna know why?  Read more!  My girlfriend and I went here on the two week anniversary of The Casablanca's opening, a Saturday night at around 10pm.  Before sitting at a table, we toured the place to see where we wanted to sit.  The decor was beautiful and would have been happy anywhere.  The weather was perfect so we wanted to sit outside, but all of the tables were reserved.  Empty, but reserved.  We grabbed a booth inside while we waited for our friend's to arrive.  We were greeted by a friendly waitress who handed us our light up menus.  That's right, these menus had fancy LED lighting in them.  It was a very cool effect that I have never seen before and it made them easier to read in the dark booth.  So not only cool, by useful.  Our friend's joined us at our booth and were also intrigued by the menu lights.  I asked the waitress for a mixed drink recommendation and she went off on how great the Seasonal Buck tastes.  Another waiter came up and also stated how it was his favorite drink.  I figured it's a new place, that's their specialty drink, everyone is raving about it, I've never had it or heard of it, so why not.  A round of Seasonal Bucks please!  The waitress brought the four drinks out and they were in this cool as hell copper mug that we all wanted to steal.  (Don't worry Casablanca, we didn't).  Then we all tried the drink.  I'd say it was a unanimous decision that it was the best tasting mixed drink each of us has ever had.  I'd go back just for this drink.  Seriously.  We had to order another round.  More friends arrived and they informed us that they had a reserved table outside with drink service.  We joined them for some Red Bull and vodkas.  Comfortable seats, perfect weather, nice views of the streets below, more friendly wait staff.  I think the lounge is going to take off once more people hear of it.  The Casablanca will definitely be my go to place when looking for a fun night out in Old Town.  There are plenty of reasons to go, but if for no other reason, go to The Casablanca Lounge for the Seasonal Buck drink.  Damn, that's a tasty drink!  PS: Just found a YouTube video on how to make the Seasonal Buck: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIz1Q-cLFDDw&s=12a184338ad6b9bdca25390a232260bb3815b09e940db70ae25251fed64f48e3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Iz1Q...</a>",

The atmosphere is definitely a high end lounge feel. High back booths, dark woods & the deor is appealing for sure. The cocktails were delicious & very pretty.

    "text": "My husband and I booked a ten person table on NYE. While we were looking forward to an entertaining night at this venue, as a group, we were very disappointed. For paying over $1000 on this night, we deserved better service. We are not blaming our waitress, as we understand it was a very busy night and she had a large area to cover while going up and down stairs in heels, while being subject to a lack of glassware. But the management could have organized that night a lot better. Initially, our table was not prepared, which wasn't too terrible since we arrived as doors opened for the festivities. However, we waited for a very long time for the alcohol (one hour plus).  It was not until 8:45 that we saw our server.  Once our alcohol arrived, we had no glasses, napkins, ice, water, or mixers.  It was another hour before we received any mixers or water (at this point it was 10 PM). Unfortunately after borrowing glasses from the bar upstairs, the group started to drink since we were already eating into the time we paid for. But when alcohol is involved in a large group of people, water is a must.  When one of us found a staff member to bring the group more water, unfortunately it only amounted to two wine glasses of water. Two wine glasses of water for ten people after two hours of drinking. The consumption continued throughout the night without much in the way of water or mixers.  We were told they were setting up speakers so that our table could hear music, but this never happened. The whole point of getting a booth or table was so that we could hear the music, talk with each other, and utilize a server so that we wouldn't have to push through the crowd. If our group wanted a romantic night, we would not have spent the money we did to go to a club. If we knew that it would take almost two hours to get our alcohol (as doors opened at 8 and table was not ready), then another 45min for mixers and water, no music because we were the one booth isolated from the party, and still hardly any follow up service on needing more mixers and water for the group- we would have not spent the money that we did at Casablanca. Thanks for ripping us (and what from what it sounds like- a lot of people) off. It was unfortunately a huge disappointment and we will not be returning again!",

    "text": "Wow, what a turn-around.  I'm really glad I gave this place another shot.  So, the week after my first visit (see previous review) I was invited back to Casablanca for a very good friend's birthday party.  There was no way I wasn't going, and I admit I was interested to see how his HUGE party would be handled compared to my previous experience.  I have to give props to both Trisha and Mandy for a job very well done.  Everything from check-in to service was well organized, the food was beautiful, seating was arranged for maximum capacity and there was still plenty of room to maneuver through the crowds.  Both Mandy and Trisha, along with Amar the owner were nice enough to speak with me about my previous concerns and acknowledge things that could've been better.  I was very impressed with their willingness to listen to their patrons.  To me, that shows a lot of promise that Casablanca will continue to improve and ultimately succeed.  I had a wonderful time with my friends at a fantastic party.  The live music was again stellar and I really appreciate the sexy and upscale vibe that's very different from other lounges in Scottsdale. Now that I've seen what this place is capable of, I would be happy to spend girl's night here again or enjoy an intimate booth with a date.  Order a Seasonal Buck and enjoy your night!",

Decent size dance floor with a stage (only for after the live entertainment is finish) two outdoor patios, one side has heaters the other side has a fire pit. There are two DJ's at this spot one inside and out (got to love that) keep the party going.  The restrooms are clean and have no waiting lines. Tons of room for sitting and VIP areas. The Strawberry Martini that the bartender made me had fresh crushed strawberries and was on point. Must I add the shots here ALL top shelf tequila may just do the trick, by only the first two hits LOL.  I gave Casablanca four stars because the DJ inside wasn't really paying attention to the crowd body language is key. Too many slow jams people were complaining and waiting for a faster beat. Faster songs more shots and drinks were flying just an FYI.  Now that that's all out; will I return a little visit? Yes, why not!!! I may have to bring a bit more friends this time grab a bigger table and dance my boot'a off.",

    "text": "I'm sad to report that \"The Casablanca Lounge\" that was a welcome oasis in a sea of cocktail mediocrity has morphed into just another downtown Scottsdale bar.  What attracted me instantly to The Casablanca Lounge were skilled and thoughtful bartenders that would produce wonderful and interesting craft cocktails with quality ingredients and were absolutely focused on quality, artisanal recipes and most of all, the experience of mixology from a time long forgotten.  I was \"this\" close to recommending it for my companies in flight magazine as one of the last great American bar experiences, but I'm sort of relieved that I never got around to submitting my recommendation.  It starts like this.  My wife and I thought we'd drop by for a cocktail this last saturday night for a delicious and interesting craft cocktail.  We approach the door and there's a podium set up and a lady we hadn't seen before who asked us, \"May I help you?\"  \"We're just here for some cocktails.\"  A pause.  \"Well, it's $10 for men, $5 for women.\"  That's odd, well, it was already past midnight so I didn't think it was worth paying a cover, which we hadn't been asked to pay before so I turned around.  \"$5!  $5 each! $5 for both!\"  Odd.  But then she let us in free.    We walked into the bar and it... was... disgusting.  Dirty floors, glasses across the bar, unattended and it looked like a disaster area.  We find a couple of clean seats at the bar and wait.... and wait.. and wait.  I disappear to the restroom and my wife is going to order a couple of drinks.  Then I realized that they must have had a management change because I've seen better kept restrooms in a Greyhound bus station.  During previous visits, this would have never happened.  I return to the bar and our two cocktails have arrived.  Instead of orange and lemon zest in our cocktails, we've literally got orange and lemon peels (thick pith and all) in our drinks, an incorrect liquor was used (we ordered Basil Haydens and we were charged Basil Haydens prices but for something with much lower quality) and the drink was absolutely incorrect.  After another 15 minutes, and watching some strange man walk in and out of the bar area that seemed to be a manager (tall guy, coat, scarf) but didn't seemed concerned with the operation of the bar, but seemed more interested in drunken female patrons and collecting numbers), we finally found a bartender to talk to about our cocktails.  He agreed that they weren't made properly and that there are a lot of new people and training was fairly lacking.  Sad.  We're already 45 minutes in, at this point, and I haven't had more than a couple of sips of my re-made beverage when one of the nastiest things on earth happens.  I feel something sticky on my pant leg and there's a large glob of gum was stuck on the leg of my chair and was now smashed into my pants.  I grabbed a napkin and did my best to remove it, but I'm afraid even as of Sunday, 22 hours later, my pants are permanently ruined.  I'm both pissed and sad.  I'm pissed about my experience and paying $30 for two drinks that I could have gotten poorly made ANYWHERE.  And I'm sad because one of the reliable greats, and oasis of cocktail wonderful in downtown Scottsdale has died under what seems to be horrific management, unskilled bartenders and a lack of basic bar cleanliness.  My favorite pants are absolutely ruined.  How this place went from a place that I would recommend to all of my friends and colleagues to an expensive, pretentious version of \"Patti's\" should be a federal crime.  Disgusting.  Unclean.  Pretentious.  Save this place.",

The outdoor rooftop patio is very accommodating to cigar smokers and is arranged to be conducive to any size party.  There is a large movie screen where various films are shown (without sound), which is a neat touch, but I don't know that it really adds anything to the ambiance.  I have been to Casablanca Lounge on at least three separate occasions and each time, the inside of the lounge is empty.",

Never tried it, and who cares? Go to Applebees for that. A bar is all about the drinks, the bar tenders' personality and service, and the vibe. I will definitely be coming back.  (Anyone who is a regular, feel free to connect with me. I just moved to Phoenix from Boston and I'm looking for other expats...or those who are East Coast at heart)",

    "text": "We came to Casablanca on a Saturday night to celebrate a friends birthday.  We thought it would be a good starting place, since it was more a lounge then a lounge/nightclub and somewhere new.  The positives were being able to talk to my friends without yelling.  The staff almost had a pin-up style look to them which gave a unique style to the place.  Drink prices are average, but the selection of Scotch's were spectacular.  The music was great playing a lot of classics we haven't heard in a while.  It was busy, but not packed. The menus had a nice lit up LCD screen that made them unique.  With that in mind, it couldn't keep us there for a long time.  The bar was very bright making the cozy atmosphere almost seem sterile.  The bar staff took forever to serve my friends, and it just wasn't one person.  A guy friend had to go to one side of the bar and a girl friend had to go to another to see who could get service first, and it wasn't even busy.  The music, albeit great, was old school hip-hop played in a classy bar with the staff dressed to form.  It'd be like going to a Chinese restaurant and listening to salsa music.  For now, I think I'd rather just hang out at Olive and Ivy and look over to see if Casablanca has gotten any better.",

    "text": "I loved this place when it was Estate House..... though I never ate there. Just drank. Lots. But I did love the fact that it was a rooftop bar, with a great view of downtown or the waterfront, depending on which side you sat. Who doesn't love a good glass of wine on a warm spring day, while watching the sun set? This girl loves it.  I was sad when Estate House closed, but was hopeful that something else just as great would open up. I think some sort of Cigar bar opened there... which I never went to. But then, as per usual in old town, that closed too, and then I heard rumblings of this new lounge opening.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm no longer hip. A big night out for me is staying up until 10:30pm. I was a bit worried about heading to Casablanca after dinner one night with friends and all the cool people at the bar laughing at me. Well, I can say, they didn't laugh. They were actually very low key, nice and welcoming. We sat outside, enjoyed some great drinks - and my husband just adored their Scotch selection.  We have gone back a few times for after dinner drinks - and each time we have a blast. I love this place - I really really hope it sticks!",

The DJ was actually pretty good which is quite the contrary of how I personally feel about most DJs in AZ. The setting and Aura were very nice too to bring a lady friend for a date. Balcony with heated lamps if u wanna step away from the music but still hear it in the background. Good eclectric group of people as well. I gave it four stars on their nightlife because they didn't have their bar fully stocked and were lacking Tito's vodka and several other requests I made for myself and my friends. The hookahs stopped being served a little early in my opinion but to be fair I don't remember the exact time we requested it. I just felt like we had time to kill when our request was made. Overall it's a nice spot to chill on a Sat night so I'll definitely be going back.",

We polished off the tasteless cheese sandwich 10 minutes before our cocktails were delivered. Later, we ordered more drinks, and the wait was equally as long for those drinks. Why??",

She brought us water & menus. I had informed her we had a Groupon. She told us our choices with the Groupon. We had the chicken wings which were tasty. The drinks we had we just ok. I had a lemon drop martini which was weak. The young lady who never told us her name came to pick up the plate but never asked if we wanted anything else. We finished our drinks & without asking if we wanted another she informed us that everything was covered under the Groupon. It was as if she was saying, \"Here's your hat what's your hurry\".  We left without either saying a word to us. No thank you come again. No good-bye. My daughter said thank you while we were leaving they stayed quiet. The kicker was we were the only customers in the place. Needless to say we won't be back there. I'm sure they could care less. It's a shame because the decor was interesting.",

Also note the frown upon \"booty shaking\" as if that's not a fairly universal pastime amongst all age and race demographics. Other cultures may call it \"boot scooting\" or \"shaking a tailfeather\", but the concept is the same Richard.   I get your point though, you don't want people moving rhythmically at Casablanca. You want them to be sedate. Got it!  I'd encourage Richard to maybe visit SumoMaya and other upscale establishments in Scottsdale that cater to the \"lounge\" crowd Casablanca aspires to attract. They play current pop music (the kind that's on the radio and pop charts!!) and some rap (!!) and still manage to attract a classy, mature, sophisticated crowd. It's regretful Casablanca couldn't pull this off, but IMO wrong to blame a genre of music for their failure to attract the \"right crowd\" to their establishment.   Also just who is \"the wrong crowd\", Richard? We who frequented Casablanca Lounge when the music was better are all childless professionals with disposable income who've traveled extensively. I have a career in Wealth Management. My girlfriends who I frequented this establishment with are Vice Presidents of Strategy, Directors of Operations, Business Analysts, District Managers, etc.. So, professional women who like to dance (and yes BOOTY SHAKE!) on the weekend are amongst the wrong crowd Richard would prefer not to have at Casablanca Lounge? Interesting and GREAT to know!!  Lastly, maybe they should update their menu to highlight these many cocktails that cost less than $12 or $14 instead of leaving patrons the responsibilty to \"guess\" drinks that may be better priced, but are nowhere to be found on the menu?",

We are in our late 30's (ugh can't believe I just said that) just looking to chill, not party.  The vibe here is perfect for that, exactly what we were expecting/wanting.  The rooftop section is gorgeous, we sat out there a bit then moved inside when the band started up.  We got a seat immediately but the longer we sat the busier it got.  I'll remember to get there early, especially if we have a group.  The drinks are pricey, to be expected for a venue such as this, but the pours are too small.  My husband's first old fashioned was literally 2 swallows, with his second old fashioned being about 3 times as large.  Not sure if they made a mistake?  I don't like inconsistency.  Also, I was expecting a lounge with such a great 'theme' to have some amazing craft cocktails but the list was unimpressive at best.  A little disappointing.   That being said, the band was phenomenal and fit the atmosphere of this old school lounge.  We will be regulars whenever we get the chance to go out and about later at night without our kids in tow! Thanks Casablanca for providing a more classy establishment compared with the majority of loud bars/clubs in downtown Scottsdale.  Not everyone likes to get sloppy drunk and party!",

I highly recommend the carnitas.  They were delicious and perfect for a large crowd. We also enjoyed the lobster grilled cheese and a few of the appetizer platters such as hummus, vegetable and bruschetta. The bartender and servers were very friendly. There were a few minor glitches having to do with the party booked before us not leaving on time, but once it was brought to the owners attention it was rectified right away.  Our guests loved the venue and had a great time. Thank you to the owner and staff at Casablanca for making my 40th so fun and memorable!",

This place has so much potential.  It is located in such a nice area in Old town Scottsdale.  The waitress was fine but over worked.  They have been opened for 3 years but can't seem to get anything right.  It is a great atmosphere but don't go for the food or the service.  We asked for napkins after we got our food.  Didn't get them.  I walked up to the bar and got some cocktail napkins to tie us over.  Finally our waitress came back and I asked again for napkins and she brought more cocktail napkins.  Small crappy napkins not fit for eating food.  Then we asked for small plates for our chicken wings and they never came.  We had to place our cocktail napkins in front of us to use as plates.  The tortilla chips were like sun chips from Costco.  Salsa was good though.  Chicken wings were not good at all.  First time I have not finished my chicken wings.  I want to give this place some advice but after 3 years. it may be hopeless.",

Although the threat of rain closed down the rooftop experience, it was the service, or lack of, that really disappointed us. Especially given that we were their only customers. The servers were more interested in each other than engaging in conversation with customers. Be careful, we thought the upgrade to the charcuterie board would include cheese as well, wrong. It was a variety of meats and fruits but no cheese. Our fault for not reading the details. Suffice it to say that this was our first and last visit. We have so many amazing choices in this area that settling for anything less is not required.",

I know they're open late so I'm not sure how crowded they get later in the night. Sat inside because it was raining while we were there so we couldn't sit outside. Normally they do have outside seating and it's right on the waterfront so the view looked nice. Dim lighting and tiny little booths, very intimate so this would be a great spot for date night. As part of our Groupon we got a bottle of wine and then chose the charcuterie board as our appetizer. The board was an interesting assortment but everything was very good. The main reason I'm giving this review 5 stars is because of the excellent service we received. Our server was very attentive, super nice and then I'm not sure if it was the owner or manager, but he was walking around making sure everyone was doing okay too. Loved the service! Would definitely come back for another date night!",

I was confused, so I asked for a little more lime juice and it was no help. I've never had Soco & Lime and not enjoy it. I had ordered one for a friend and myself, paid over $25 + tip. I was left disappointed, confused and frustrated. I thought to myself, what's wrong w/ this drink? I talked to a friend about the next day, she said it was probably watered down. It made sense, because it was bland! Who waters down Southern Comfort??? I called to talk to management about my experience and no one called me back. Bad experience.",

I called for a reservation after not being able to make one online and then found out they are not hosting live music anymore (which was originally a huge reason I wanted to go). I was also told there would be a large party there, so their regular patio wasn't available. I said that was fine as long as there was some outside seating, which they confirmed, there was. I thought everything was set, only to find out they didn't actually write down the reservation! Very strange. Managed to be seated anyway because the place was practically empty. Overall I enjoyed the views but for the general confusing nature of the whole situation, as well as the overpriced drinks, and lack of live music, I will probably not go back.",

As for seating, it's mostly reserved so call ahead of time to reserve a table.  Getting to it can be tricky. Look for a ground level sign that points in the direction of the stairs and just follow the stairs all the way up to the third level. You won't hear much of the music so look for a security guard.

However, the dance floor is small and unfortunately their servers often walk through the middle of the dance floor with drinks they are serving. Show up early on the weekends if you want to find a place to sit and enjoy the music and cocktails.",

I like to think of myself as a cocktail enthusiast. The cocktail menu read well and a couple of drinks really stood out. Had their seasonal mule and a couple of shots of whiskey that were harder to find in the valley. Bartenders were great and happy with the drinks. Then the music went on, we had migrated to the patio to enjoy a wonderful AZ night and were blasted by distorted and terrible guitarist / vocalist. I really wanted to throw him a fish! We lasted about 4 songs then tabbed out and left after we couldn't bare the musical ear infection anymore. As we left we realized how awful the music really was, we heard 2 more groups on the street comment on where that awful music is coming from. All in all, Place is cool. Drinks and bar staff great. Minus one star for location and signage. Almost minus two but just one star for music. Maybe they were just entertaining one of their investors and letting his son play or something!",

    "text": "Update: It's change up as far as ownership, but man this place was great... hope it continues! ~~~~~~~~~~~  There are so many options in Scottsdale when it comes partying, but I find Casablanca Rooftop Lounge to be one of my meetup spots with local & visiting friends. The keyword of \"lounge\" truly being the state of this place as it's relaxed, chill and has a good vibe.   If you looking to plan some a meeting place with a nice vibe, I still think this is a great spot for friends to come together as it offers a balcony view what chairs and awning cover that overlook a portion of the Scottsdale Waterfront area.  Live music is usually on tap for the weekend in the evenings & the night we were there, we were fortunate to enjoy the group \"Level 3\" that night. The music and atmosphere was a nice vibe as it was a mix of people... the biggest downfall to the experience was the speed of getting drinks to our table. Our server just wasn't available and honestly, we could've spent at least another $100 dollars. They do have VIP Bottle service with a reserved table so we should have considered, but given the small group size, we didn't expect the wait to be so long. I've done the table service in the past for another celebration and we did have to squeeze into the half-round booth (not so comfortable, but ladies did appreciate it)  The bartenders were overwhelmed at times but did a good job of filling the gaps and getting drinks out as needed when you came up to the bar. Rounding up my review from 3.8 to 4 as the server service is something that can always change from one person to another. I'm not a Cigar connoisseur but friends in our party took advantage of the Cigar Room and a few selections.",

    "text": "We were recently in Scottsdale for a golf weekend and we were looking for a good spot to get drinks after dinner. I opened Yelp and Casablanca was near the top of the list, and it happened to be only two blocks away from our dinner spot, so we started walking.  We walked upstairs and into the bar, with no cover at the time. It wasn't particularly crowded, but it was still early. We made our way out to the patio and got some drinks. There was an eclectic mix of people of all ages, all having a good time in the perfect Spring evening weather.   As we enjoyed our drinks, we noticed that here was a live band setting up inside, and when they started playing, the joint started jumpin'! We made our way inside and posted up near the band, and they were really good! A quartet made up of a drummer, bassist, keyboardist and a guitarist/singer. They played all types of popular music, and we couldn't help but to shake our money makers.  We met tons of cool people that night. A bachelorette party from Minnesota, local college students and professionals, and everyone was having a great time.   I want to call out the amazing bar staff that was working their a$$ off, quickly serving the large crowd with dim lighting and loud music. They were unfazed and rolled with it.  If you're in the area and looking for good drinks and great live music, check this place out. I think you'll like it. We sure did!",

    "text": "Okay, so let's start with the positives.  The view is wonderful!  The day we stopped in was gorgeous, so to spend the late afternoon outside with a breeze and a drink was a great way to escape the cold of Chicago.  We were greeted by a polite server.  He explained the happy hour special (which I was believe was $2 off some glasses of wine and most of the sharing plates).  We ended up ordering the dip, which was really good!  I could have ordered more of that!  After he provided drinks, another server began wandering around the patio.  This is where things took a turn for the worse.  Unfortunately, she rarely came to see us.  She was quite inattentive.  Close to the time we were leaving, tables around us were leaving after not being greeted for close to 15 minutes.  The place was getting a little busier, but I think it was worsened by the fact that the servers were standing around talking.  As we left, we saw them just chatting with the bartender and making no efforts to attend to their patrons.  We closed out our tab, asking for a printed receipt (they use an iPad).  We never got this, so we stopped by the chatty crew on the way out.  She then printed it for us.  We were further disappointed by the experience when we got in the car and looked at the receipt to find that she didn't give us the happy hour pricing.  It wasn't worth going back inside for $6, but it left us with a pretty negative experience.  Perhaps the staff should focus more on their jobs than on gossiping with colleagues and they could elevate to a solid 5 stars.",

The day before we were to visit, one of my friends purchased a groupon package for some appetizers and drinks for Casablanca Rooftop. Mind you, this was 3 days ago. When we arrived at 7pm, the doors were locked, rooftop abandoned and not one sign to indicate the status of the business. The week preceding our visit, we called repeatedly and tried to make online reservations. Of course, there was never an answer or any reservations to be had. There was another group of befuddled folks at the door at the same time as we were, Groupon in hand wondering what was going on. Insult to injury three fold: climbed 3 flights of stairs in 105 degree heat to find it shut down AND - YELP- why are you helping them with your reservations system, And - Groupon, why are you selling packages for this company?  I understand that businesses close, but this owner is beyond irresponsible.",

The usually have a live band and when they aren't playing, they have a nice selection of R&B or other recognizable music to jam to and enjoy your night out.   Love that they have both indoor and outdoor seating. People usually do get out on the dance floor but it's laid back so if you'd rather sit at the bar or at a table that works too. The outdoor rooftop has comfortable seating and one section even has a fire pit, which is nice in the chillier months.   From the rooftop you get a great view of the Old Town Plaza. It's super pretty at night with all of the lights and they have cool light up menus so you can see them in the dark. Great place to bring people visiting from out of town!",

Seeing that Casablanca is one of my top 5 movies of all time we had to go.   Since it was a beautiful evening we sat out on the deck. We were immediately greeted and we ordered our cocktails before we even sat down. As the sun went down the gas heaters were a great addition. Our bartender/server (gosh I forget her name but she was wonderful) made sure we never lacked for thirst. There is live music and the band was setting up as we left for dinner.   If you are bothered by cigar smoke (I'm not) be aware they have a humidor and you can smoke a heater on the deck. This venue was a nice change of pace from the other bars in the area and highly recommended for date night.",

The doorman, host, service staff and servers are wonderful to work with. The Promoters for table service are also very nice. The lounge is neat and classy. It's always a good time with a great crowd.   The food is very good here. Plenty of tables to sit down and enjoy a meal.",

    "text": "without a doubt the worst service I have ever received ... last night, Thursday Oct 24th, we arrived at the lounge which is absolutely beautiful ... a band was playing and they were wonderful ... we were three of maybe 20 customers in the entire place and we took seats at the bar. it took a good 8 to 10 minutes for the bartender to get to us although we were trying to get her attention ... she appeared to be a new bartender as she was searching for bottles and did not seem to know the location of things behind the bar. we enjoyed our cocktails and listened to the band, after about 25 or 30 minutes I was ready for another cocktail, try as I may I could not get the bartenders attention, mind you, at this point there were maybe only 10 customers in the entire bar including the patio area ... I finally got the attention of the manager who came behind the bar and he got me a second cocktail.  during the time that he was getting my cocktail the band took a break between sets, when the band was ready to start the final set, it took about 7 or 8 minutes for them over the microphone to get the attention of the manager and bartender to turn off the house music ... at this point there are only 5 people in the bar who were all laughing because it was so funny that the band could not get the attention of the employees, the manager finally turned off the house music and the band began playing the final set, at this point my two friends were ready for their second cocktail and we again could not get the attention of the bartender or the manager ... we were literally waving our arms for a good 5 minutes trying to get their attention, I finally got up from my seat and walked to the end of the bar where the manager was socializing with the bartender and I asked him if I could speak to him for a moment to which she said sure and stepped from behind the bar to talk to me and I explained to him that although the bar was beautiful and the band was very engaging and wonderful that the service was absolutely horrible ... his response was, and I quote \" well then I think you've had enough and you guys should leave\", absolutely no apology for the poor service, just told us to leave, mind you, my friends were still waiting for just thier secnd drink and I was still enjoy my second. I absolutely will not be back and I will be contacting the general manager to discuss the situation.  On a side note, The manager on duty seemed to be flirting and making himself very familiar with the bartender. I did pay my $30 tab and tipped the bartender $5 ... even though the service was very slow, she was friendly and again it was obvious that she was new.  The managers attitude on the other hand was horrific and completely unacceptable.",

    "text": "Yes, the place is nice, but it is True, the service needs a lot of work.  When I came in, I asked the hostess to direct me to the group of girls I was meeting.  On my way there, I girl jump on my path, I didn't know who she was, but she was so rude, she cut me off, and on top she gives me the \"EXCUSE ME\" with the two snaps and a zig zag attitude. Later I realized she was a server.  Way to go, customer service.  I just laughed it off, because I was going to have fun with my girls.  I love meeting girlfriends out and there is very little that can upset me enough to not enjoy my night.  I really wanted to like this place, but the owners need to hire more experienced management and servers.  Not everyone is cut out to do customer service, specially in the \"service industry\".  My drink was good, I stayed with a safe bet I have had before.  I asked if I could have a taste, instead our server said she would ask the bartender to match my taste and  if I didn't like it she could switch it. I hate returning drinks.  It would have been so much easier to just let me have a taste and if I liked it, I would have had it.  The cheese platter was really pathetic for $25.  Hopefully they will take care of the kinks, because the place is very nice and the music was great.  This could be such a great place to hang out with friends and chit chat, without loosing your voice.",

If you sit at the bar, you order your drink off of an Ipad. In my opinion, this is very impersonal. I couldn't request a certain drink off the ipad either, so we waited to order from the bartender. He was super busy and when he finally took the time to talk to us, he didn't seem enthusiastic about making a drink that wasn't on the menu.  In the end, my drink did turn out pretty good (some mixed whiskey drink), but that's not the only reason I go to a fancy bar. I expected a friendly bartender ready to bestow some mixology wisdom on me! This didn't happen. I recommend going during happy hour, if they have one. The drinks are very expensive.",

I think I kept opening and closing mine for a short while, lol.  Everything is clean and prestine.  When my beer arrived, it was in a beautiful glass with NO water stains whatsoever!!  This is not a place where you have to check your glass to make sure there aren't lip stains from a previous customer...  Jimmy and Ken were the bartenders taking care of us last night.  They were both VERY friendly and funny!  Ken should be a comedian!!  He had my sisters and I laughing for 2 hours!  Yes, the drinks are a bit pricey, but the drinks are fabulous!  It is definitely a treat to go to The Casablanca, and well worth the price.  :)",

It started when my friends and I arrived and was greeted by Taylor the Hostess who was so welcoming and friendly. Trisha the event coordinator was absolutely amazing and so accommodating to my every wish. We sat outside on the patio by the fire pit, and it was probably the best seat in the house It was so comfortable for my 15-20 person party. Ashley was our server and she was the best. She had great recommendations and knew EXACTLY what she was talking about when it came to explaining all the different drinks. Rich the Bar Manager was just as wonderful and even created a special drink for my birthday so my friends and I could enjoy something personalized just for me. Prices were totally fair, music was great to dance to outside, and the view from the patio was to die for. I am so so happy I came here for my birthday, and will continue to come here. Again thank you so much everyone. :)",

It's a really great atmosphere and there was an amazing live band and I even liked the light-up menus, but the service killed it for me. The manager tried to come over and salvage an experience that was spiraling downward for myself and seven other girls. She made it worse. Trying to get our checks sorted out was a nightmare. I almost felt sorry for our server because she clearly wasn't capable or prepared to handle a table of eight. We were told she was new by the manager, which I also didn't like. Why would you assign a new server to a group? She didn't know what was in the drinks and wasn't familiar with the menu. One of the girls in our group had to flag down the manager just to get my one (and only) round of drinks. I'd love to give this place another shot if they can invest in better service. The company, however, was fabulous! To all the ladies out on Saturday night, I had a blast with you all! Despite the Casablanca shitstorm. Does anyone know the name of the band that was playing there on Saturday? I'd definitely love to see them again (at another venue!).",

    "text": "This hidden speakeasy is the epitome of class and ambiance. This is not the kind of place you accidentally stumble into. It's the kind of place where you would see the lights on the rooftop patio and wonder what's going on up there. Parking can be a challenge so I suggest valet parking.   The lounge is dimly lit and cozy, yet definitely upscale. The clientele ranged from 30's to early 50's. Seating is very comfortable and perfect for long conversations. They layout is arranged to allow adequate privacy and intimate conversations.  The \"mixologist\" (aka bartender) is friendly. Made us feel like old time friends. The server was a wee bit on the snooty side, but friendly enough and quick to empty ashtrays and check on us.   Outside, is a rooftop patio which quickly became my favorite area. There are misters under the cabana portion of the patio as well as sofa seating. Open seating consists of comfortable chairs and side tables. Outdoor heaters are present for chilly nights.   Entertainment that evening was a vocalist, accompanied by a guitar player and bongo player. She was talented as were the other two. Her voice was soothing and it was the perfect compliment for this type of environment/establishment.   The drinks were generous, well presented and flawlessly made. They were not watered down or weak. I was expecting a dainty little glass for my cocktail, but it was presented in a large, chilled tin cup and garnished beautifully. So speakeasy-esque.   This is the perfect place to enjoy a good cocktail and cigar, whether you're unwinding after a long day, or gearing up for a night on the town.   I will definitely be back. As often as I can.",

Walked in here last week on a weeknight.  There wasn't a single person in the place.  The bartender and the waitress were kinda hanging out.  Bartender hands us menus.  I ask if they have blue cheese olives to make a dirty martini.  He gives me some story about how they can't because they aren't a kitchen (huh?..whatever) and he walks back into something that looks like a kitchen.  Then he doesn't come back.  And doesn't come back.....5-10 minutes go by and we are awkwardly sitting at the bar wondering what the heck just happened?!!..  So we leave.  Clearly they didn't want to have to serve customers.  This place needs to either shut its doors or get better service that cares about keeping customers there.",

    "text": "I'm giving this place two stars; one for having good food and drinks and one for having a great atmosphere.  However I did not feel like I had a good experience here last night.  A Group of friends and I sat on the patio last night. The gentleman in our group was about 150 pounds and he sat in one of the patio chairs.  Within the first 10 minutes of arriving one of the legs on the chair broke and my friend fell flat on his back on the patio. The manager or supervisor never came over to make sure he was OK and not injured. Later in the night a server brought over an extra martini that we did not order. We triple check to make sure that everyone had a drink before she set it down and we said we did not order that, everyone has their drink nobody is done with their drink yet. She left it on the table and said \"I'm sure someone will drink this if I leave it here\" and still charged us for that drink that nobody drank. Finally when it came time to go I was in a little bit of a rush to get home when I realize the server hadn't come back to our table for half an hour.  It took us half an hour to get our check, we had to stand up and get her attention to come over and bring us the check. This place is beautiful with a great atmosphere and great food and drinks and has such potential to be five stars. Unfortunately, The experience we had was terrible.",

We arrived waited 20 mins at the door then were taken to our table.The table I purchased was advertised for 12 guests at a cost totaling $1483. When we sat down it was only prepped for 6! No way to seat 12 comfortably. 6 glasses for drinks & 6 for champagne! So we order Drinks and mixers and we're ready to start the night. I ordered 3 apple Ciroc and one grey goose. So out to the table comes two big apple Ciroc one small Apple Ciroc bottle and a regular vodka. I ask the girl about it and she apologized and brings the regular size Apple and never returns with grey goose. She pours our drinks which I have to help with because her arm is broken and she's struggling opening bottles and pouring them. As the night goes on we basically never had a waitress again we never had refill on mixers never had more cups no ice everything was empty all night we had to go to bar and ask for cups which they didn't have and ask them to fill up our empty cranberry craft, pineapple bottle, and orange juice bottle, And then ask Another table to use their cups. We ordered food that never came and to top it off we had no champagne ever it never arrived! We had no toast for the New Years count down! Waitresses would occasionally walk by and if we asked for something we needed it never was delivered back. The total price included mandatory tip. This establishment was completely unprepared for the New Years event and sad the patrons were the ones who had to suffer on such a special event for many!",

Upon walking in and wandering around looking for a place to sit down a waitress approached us and offered to help find our group a place to sit down and relax. Within 5 minutes she had a large seating area cleaned and ready for us. The low point was when I ordered a vodka martini on the rocks with a twist but got a regular martini, in a martini glass, with an olive.  I thought that was a bit odd for a high end lounge but maybe I should just learn to order more popular drinks in the future.    Full disclosure - I am rooting for these waterfront places to succeed. It has been a tough few years and I admire the business owners who keep putting these places out there hoping that one day their venture on Southbridge will make it for the long haul.",

The 5 STAR moment: I had a VERY VERY good Tom Collins, made by a handsome bartender.  My friend and I decided to move to a table since we decided to order food, and the bartender continued to serve us, even though he had to continually walk around the bar.  It was nice and professional of him not to switch us over/close us out. The management was also very polite to come over to inquire about our experience at Casablanca.    The unfortunate part in our experience was our food was VERY late.  I know the food comes from the Herb Box, which is tasty and the restaurant was very busy (Saturday night), but the food was less than desirable how and when it was served.  The staff apologized and they did discount the food, so they did try and make it right. My biggest issue with the whole food experience is this has happened to me before with a large group here.    As far as the ambiance goes, this place is 'loungey' as the name says, with dark corners, dim lighting and cozy seating.  There is usually a band or a DJ playing enjoyable/soothing tunes.  It was dead when we arrived, but it picked up around 9...I am not complaining though because we were therefor able to have an outstanding bar experience.   Main point:  Go to Casablanca for drinks and the lounge...not the food.",

That said, the Saturday night crowd was having a great time, and the patio seemed like a very nice setting for dining out above the fray.",

    "text": "I was here back in 10/13 and thought this place was on its way out.  Thankfully the little details that make a nightspot a gem were all addressed. Diversity, Class & it seemed like folks come to Casablanca to have fun.  1. ALL the staff were on point.  From the gal at the door; the bouncers were cool; the bartenders were smooth with drink prep.  Who slices a lemon to rub on the rim of a glass and then takes a towel to wipe the glass down????  I'd expect that from a place charging more than just $10 at the door.  Nice touch.  The guy in the restroom seemed like he knew each paper towel personally & actually pointed out an upturned collar and another dudes tie that was tucked into his pants.  Classy.  2.  The live music.  The band was SWIF Music...hands down the best band I've seen in AZ.  PERIOD.  A full band playing R&B and doing it well....never seen it before in AZ.  They had the floor packed & folks were getting it in.  The back vocalists were dancing, the lead was dancing.  If you've ever seen a local band with big talent, you'll know how it felt.  They had a song about remembering to visit the bartenders.  You'd think it would come off as trashy but they grooved it.  They did Treasure by Bruno Mars & Remember the Time by MJ back to back and killed both of em.  If you like live R&B with a seamless band, you can pay $$$ to see Mint Condition or you can check SWIF out.  (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSwifMusic&s=dccc358b3586e24837278a8c0bd0cf2a9731f2deb9e03fd800ff8372d93387be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/SwifMusic</a>)  3.  Patrons.  It looked initially like the normal mix of scottsdale pretty people and the folks that came to watch/touch them.  That changed quick.  This goes back to the band cuz they turned up the energy and the well dressed folks in the room started dancing.  It was over from there.  I like seeing folks that put in effort to look their best put in work on the floor.  Old folks, young, white & black....everybody was rocking.  This mix is seen all over scottsdale but not in such a classy & fun way.    4.  DJ's.  Reggae outside and a ridiculous 90's/Top 40 mix that never sagged indoors.  The DJ's were in tune with the room and it showed.  The owners & investors at Casablanca should be very proud.",

    "text": "This place was really cool. You can call for a reservation or make one at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a> (which is what I did).  The one complaint I had (lets get it out of the way now) is that I tried to reserve a table for 8 (girls night out) and opentable kept giving me the message that that wouldnt be possible for several months. When we got there, it was empty, and even after it filled up there were plenty of tables for a party that size wide open.  Ok. Glad I got that out of my system.  The ambiance here is great. Dimly lit, very lavish comfortable seating areas. The staff was friendly and the menus light up! I just think that thats a brilliant idea. There are so many places that I see people using their cell phone to read menus or sign their tabs. here, both the menu and tab jacket light up. They also leave an Ipad at your table that has lists of all their cocktails, beers, wines, and spirits at your table. Which was cool. I had their cocktail that has \"japanese\" in the title. It was good, but not really my thing. My second drink was mixed beautifully however. I was suprised at how limited their vodka selection was though (personal preference).  All in all, this was a great place to start the evening.",

When we finally got a bartenders attention and asked for a menu she said they didn't have one and didn't even try to locate one for us.  Maybe it was an off night.",

    "text": "What a great lounge to go to after dinner. The DJ outside on deck was playing some tunes I hadn't heard in a long time and you couldn't help but either sing along and dance or even say \" yes that is my jam. Oh and let us not forget the live band that was playing inside. *side note: you could not hear the band inside while sitting outside and vice versa. Loved that\" *  Back to the band, Vaughn Willis and the band were on fire! It was a great way to end my 40th birthday celebration. Great company, great dj, great band, great drinks, one hell of a good time!",
