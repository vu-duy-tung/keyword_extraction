I came in and sat at the bar, ordered a beer and some wings. Actually, I ordered alot of wings. They showed up quickly and they were excellent. I say again, the wings are excellent. The service is a little confusing, because I was never serviced by the same person twice - but the personnel is polite and quick.   The only negative I can say is that it was loud in here, very loud. Maybe because of the football game that was on - but even so a little too loud for any kind of natural conversation.   Summary.  Its nice, clean and have a good atmosphere. The wings are rockin' and the service is great. I will be a return customer.  .. und das ist nach der kritiker.",

Despite the silly waitress, we got some giant beers and a few of their mixed drinks. Holy cow were the drinks delicious! That cheered me right up. Except then we realized two tables we were ahead of, got ALL of their food before we even received our appetizer. Might have been because they were all handsome dudes and the waitress seemed more interested in talking to them instead of doing her job.  Our appetizer was actually pretty dang good though seeing as it was just queso and salsa with chips, and we got some burgers. The burger was great. It was one of the biggest I've seen for sure. Haha.   I would probably go again if I was in the area and needed a drink really quick, but I won't be planning a night out there ever again.",

Not from a place where somebody cooks for a living.   I was also charged twice on my card for two different amounts. I was with a friend, but we had two separate bills and two separate cards. I'm sure they will take care of it but I'm not sure how that happened in the first place.

They do 1/2 off all drinks and appetizers 4-7pm on weeknights. There are also pretty good daily specials such as Taco Tuesday and Pizza...Thursday? Regardless, their food is pretty good for the price and their bartenders do not skimp on the liquor in well drinks, regardless of whether it's happy hour. Thursdays beginning at 9 is buy one get one all well drinks, too.  The service is okay, but you can't be TOO expectant since they usually seem staffed pretty thin and the place is pretty much always busy. The staff is attentive, though, however infrequent they may be able to get to your table.  The ambience is awesome. They have leather armchairs at the bar and the entire place is done in wood and bookshelves. Its mostly a sports bar, but it's also a great college hangout spot. I've had some great nights here.  When it's cold, they have heaters out on the patio along with two fire pits in a seating area/lounge. They allow smoking outside on the patio too.",

    "text": "I've only gone during the week at lunch hour, but this medium-sized sports bar has a lot of food and drink specials.  Their wings are pretty good. Definitely above average. The medium wings are crispy and had just right amount of sauce. The sauce itself is more mild than hot, however their hot is definitely very hot! Out of the dozen, a couple of them came out dry.  The street tacos, $1 on Tuesdays, come with crumbly cotija cheese, cabbage, and a creamy cilantro sauce. The chicken was well-seasoned and were great. Very tasty. The shredded carnitas were very good but a couple of them came out dry. The steak seemed unseasoned and just didn't taste very good.  The burgers were just okay and the sliders are barely the size of a silver dollar. In both cases they seemed to be under-seasoned.  The pizza comes on a crispy crust and an underwhelming marinara sauce. And the cheese...I just didn't like. It definitely changed in flavor when the couple of slices I took back were reheated 4-5 hours later.  Service is spotty. It will go from friendly and prompt to almost non-existent depending on the day.  There are TVs all over the place but some are up really high and only of the 17\"/19\" variety. I'll have to try this place out when a big game is on.",

Ordered the $6 buffalo pizza. Sauce was way to peppery and hot for my liking. Chicken rolls ok, but really heavy. Chips and dip trio also just ok.  I'm glad we only spent $31 for all of that food.

I've worked customer service in banking & Home Depot for over 40 years & always prided myself on giving great customer service.

My biggest pet peeve with nachos is when the toppings/cheese only covers half the nachos. These nachos were the epitome of that. The flavor was nice, but I had a nice pile of topping-less chips at the end. :(   The fried zucchini wasn't completely fried so the inside was still doughy. The vegetarian tacos have minimal flavor. Cue all three hot sauces they have available.   My pear cider was pretty decent, but my boyfriend said the gingerbread beer was less than average.   The waitress was super friendly and it has a nice atmosphere. We went for the BCS Championship game and there are ample televisions for viewing. I'd definitely go back for another game, but definitely not solely for food.",

We went there the other night hoping to have some fun with our friends however we never even made it into the bar because of this lake they have in the parking lot and the rude customers this bar attracts. One of our friends slipped in mud walking in and while we were standing their helping her clean her foot and shoes, an asshole decided to speed through the puddle, probably finding it hilarious, and splashed us all leaving us soaked and covered in mud. My phone was ruined with water damage. We went to the front demanding to speak to the manager or someone on charge for the night, explaining the situation, and he laughed. We asked again to please get a manger, simply because that puddle needed to be taken care of immediately so this would not happen to other customers and to recommend they have security of some sort patrolling the parking lot because no one should be reaching speeds like this guy in the truck did. This is simply for safety precautions of the future. However, the kid checking IDs at the front refused to get a manager and we stood there waiting for 20 minutes, asking again if he was going to get the manager.  The fact that the management has completely over looked this reflects a complete disregard for customers and their safety and the lack of respect this business exhibits.  I will never be returning nor recommending this place to any of my friends.",

I think I've had a fried something or other at one point or another and likely an order of wings; but again the food isn't why I visit. This spot is fairly busy all the time, again, think drink prices; those cheap drinks really keep this place in business. They do have a Taco Tuesday special on tacos, but I think there *might* be better places out there for tacos. Drinks are not amazing, you won't find anything special or exceptional, but you can't mess up a beer or an alcohol with a diet coke mixer, well, you can, but it's pretty difficult. Take this spot for what it is, a hang out and grab a drink, I like the atmosphere though!  Happy Yelping.",

It was super slow and I was told about the Bloody Mary bar, so of course I said YES!! I wasn't aware, which was partially my fault for not asking, that every time I went to get a \"refill\" I had to pay $8 I figured (this being a blonde moment) that I was going to pay a certain amount and it was good for the afternoon - that's how it is at several places I have been to. That's not the reason for my not so good review. I actually had to get up every time to get my drink replaced - what happened to my cocktail waitress?? The waitress I had wasn't super friendly but she did take my food order and nothing was wrong with it and I did enjoy my BBQ pork sliders.   My only recommendation is that if it's busy you may want to go elsewhere if you expect to have good service (service with a smile) or service at all. I was rarely checked on and that to me speaks mounds.",

All of a  sudden we  look around and their bringing out lunch food for tables around ours. Waitress never came back to tell us they were serving lunch. So we asked for lunch menu and placed an order of chicken tenders at start of 4th quarter. Last 3 minutes to end of game still no food. Waitress said be food will be up shortly. Waitress brings food we asked for plates and are told had no clean dishes. Waitress got us 3 lined food baskets. We ate and left.  Chicken tenders were good..  We''ve been to this establishment for happy hour. Always good food and service. Not today!!!! Won't go back for a game!",

This is becoming a favorite place of mine to hang out after work when I am looking for a quiet happy hour. If I am not going with a group of people and just want to hang alone or with another person, this spot is an excellent sports bar, has great happy hour prices, and good food.   I have had the street tacos before - one night of the week they are $1. Small, but tasty. During happy hour 4-7 drinks are half price as is the food. I had the wings and while the hot had an underlying spicy flavor, they also seemed to be somewhat sweet. Either way they were good. I have also had chips and salsa before  - the chips are fresh and immediately out of the cooker and the salsa is spicy. They do have $1 pints, but I am confused when that happens. I thought it was 4-7, but it might have been until 4. When I received my bill my first 2 were $1, then others were $2. Still a good price.  Oh, and I have to say - the staff at the Devil's Advocate is the hottest in town.",

    "text": "I think this is my place of choice for specials. There are specials (food and drink) every day of the week. Usually, the long island ice tea is my choice because it's only $4 on certain days. Also, $5 wings and $6 whole pizzas on other days. $5 giant mugs of beer too for the specials.   A lot of times, I only go on days with the long island special. The food is not bad for a sports bar and grill. I had the steak nachos, pizza and wings before and they were good. Depending on the days, service could be slow especially if there is a college game day or just a lot of people there.  What you should do is go on their website, see what they have on that day, and decide if you want to go. That's the best way to do it. Because some specials don't apply on college game days.  And plan out your trip with the light rail if you don't want to drive. It's a 5 minute walking distance from the University and Rural station. Then go drink and take the rail back home. Or take the rail Mill Ave for more drinks.  Like I said, check their website for the happy hour menu and the daily specials. Then decide if you want to go. There's also a sushi restaurant across the street, and a shwarma, Indian, Thai and pizza place next door too. If you don't want food at DA's, grab cheap drinks and go eat elsewhere.  Or grab some drinks and go to Fedex Kinkos next door to hang out. I'm sure the employees will love that. ;)",

I was like ok gross, but my kid isn't picky. Then another 10 min goes by and my burger comes out. Onion ring ON my burger and a heap of raw onion on the lettuce next to it and my side said is smothered in diced onion! I'm like hold on! Wtf?! I told this very dim looking waitress, \"I said I'm allergic to onions!\" \"She's like ooooh yea.\" She takes the burger back to the kitchen. A min later she appears with the SAME burger and a fresh salad. So I politely yet firmly ask \"did you just remove the onions and bring me the same burger?\" She replies \"well yea, the onion was only touching the lettuce\". I was dumbfounded. Are you f****** kidding me?!?! I will never eat here again! Clearly the waitresses are not college students. You don't give someone the same contaminated plate back when the have a serious allergen.

    "text": "I have been coming to Devils for over 2 years on Thursday and every UFC fight. It saddens me to give a terrible review to one of my regular bars.   A couple of us went to the bar for the Mcgregor Mayweather fight. We took to the patio where our server was Riley with the red hair. She was absolutely terrible! She refused to do individual bills, and it was impossible to get her. I understand it was packed and there are other customers, but when I order a water cup at 6 pm and never got it, like that is insane! I had to go to the bar consistently to get a cup of water.  I wish that was the only problem. Our group had to haul down other waitresses and back boys to get her, where she took forever to come serve our table! Now she did sort of well bringing our drinks after it took an hour to get her. She was an extremely rude waitress and was appalling over all. Gratuity is suppose to represent how well the server served the table. Riley complained to our faces as well as other customers about the poor tip when the service was terrible. Afterwards, she complained to the bouncer with the hat in which the bouncer said \"get the f*** out for tipping bad.\" The bar has a right to refuse customers, but to kick out customers for tipping poorly? Under what law of Arizona does a bar kick you out for tipping poorly? Under what law of Arizona do I have to tip a terrible waitress! The bouncer was just extremely rude.  The audacity to complain about the tip after your service is insane. I personally feel you got lucky to even get a tip.   So thank you Riley the terrible waitress and the idiot bouncer with the hat for ruining one of our favorite places to eat and drink! Riley should give her tips to the back boys and other waitresses for that terrible service.",

The nachos... hmmm, what can I say that is good about the nachos... nothing.  In fact, they were probably the worst nachos that I have ever had.  I really hate to knock a family-owned restaurant, but... perhaps the southwestern style cuisine on the menu should just be taken off and replaced by something else like burgers.    With that said, overall my bill only came out to $17 with two margaritas and three tacos on it!

    "text": "Ok so I love this bar on Thursdays typically because it's 2 for 1 drinks and it's usually beautiful.  Well last night was one of the worst experiences ever. The girl I ordered drinks from was so mean, didn't smile didn't say thank you or even look like she gave any cares about anything. And then I went to the restroom and it ran out of toilet paper so I kindly asked the security guard who was in front of the male restroom if he could get us some or ask another associate to get some for the ladies.  His response was I don't care about y'all I'm guarding the men's room and I'm not leaving and I don't care so no I'm not. I again said well we are woman we literally NEED toilet paper if you can please ask someone else to get us some that'd be great. Again he said \"girl I'm busy I don't have time to get y'all drunk asses toilet paper stop asking leave me alone\" I then went to one of the og bartenders who I know has been bartending there for a while and asked to speak to a manager about the situation and found out the very rude bartender who was serving me before was supposedly the manager. I understand this is a \"college\" bar but service is everything especially for me who has been in the industry for years and this was just SAD. I definitely will not be back any time soon, I'll just wait out the cycle of associates.",

    "text": "This place wasn't bad, but I was a little irritated by something. I called ahead, because I live in Glendale and this is a bit of a drive for me. I wanted to ask if I could not only watch the Diamondbacks game, but also hear the sound. I can go to any sports bar and watch the game without sound, but when I called they told us we WOULD be able to watch the game with sound.  However, once we got there we were told that we weren't able to watch the game with sound because the NHL playoffs and the NBA playoffs were on. I really don't have an issue with that, but I did have an issue with them telling us on the phone that they would do that for us.  As for the rest, the service really wasn't bad, the Caesar salad is a HUGE portion for only $6.50. We apparently got there during happy hour, so our first two drinks were 4 dollars, but they didn't give us any notification of happy hour until we got our checks.  During our time here we also ordered 2 additional drinks that were 8 dollars a piece. Again, not really a big deal but we had no idea what time happy hour was or when it ended. Most restaurants  tell us it's happy hour when we sit down.  Honestly, i'd probably go back to this place when the playoffs aren't on. They really weren't a bad place overall, but the communication leaves a lot to be desired. They did tell me if the playoffs weren't on, they would have been happy to turn the sound on for me. So, for now i'm just gonna leave it at 3 stars until I get another opportunity to try them out.",

I walked inside and went straight to the bar to order a drink. Of course, it was crowded because it was Saint Patty's Day. I'd been waiting for 10 minutes or so, and a guy walks up next to me, shakes hands with the bartender (not who I'm talking about) and gets his drinks right away. I wait for another 5 minutes or so, getting more frustrated. Then another guy walks up, super nice, finally gets the female bartender's attention. I believe her name is Lauren. He explained, \"These girls were here first\", so I quickly asked, \"Are you sure?\" and thanked him. Then the bartender  says, \"You lost your shot.\" and walks away from us without taking any drink orders... The guy was just trying to be nice... Couldn't believe we were treated in such a way.",

I have giving this place it's fair shot now over 10 visits - the most recent being the worst... If you get a table away from the bar good luck seeing your server more than once an hour. If you feel the bar is better suited you're in for another rude surprise as well as the service there is equally as bad. It's truly a shame. Such a good location and venue wasted away by poor staff and management. The only real appeal left to this place is it's two for one specials on Thursdays... but to take full advantage you better know at least some of the staff on a first name basis...",

Mixes the best attributes and ingredients of your favorite bar sandwich and country club snack. Pair that sandwich with a basket of french fries and one of their various ice cold beers on tap and it's an unbeatable lunchtime meal. Dinner's just as great, especially on Tuesday!! $1 tacos and $2 Dos Equis is the best deal in Tempe and the deal is good because the food is GREAT. Most importantly, this is the best spot in town to watch ASU football games in the fall and winter. A total Sun Devil bar!!",

The chicken is thigh meat and the steak had no resemblence to steak or carne asada and the tacos were loaded with too much sauce and cheap cabbage. Pretty average beer selection and not all seats at the bar can view the tv screens. Nice patio though and there was one pizza with potatoes that looked unique that i need to try on next visit.

She walked around the bar, came back and said the kitchen is just busy it'll be right out, as another waiter walked to our table behind her with our order... it's taco Tuesday but the service shouldn't be this bad.",

    "text": "Let's talk the worst customer service ever! I tried calling to place an order and left on hold for several minutes. I was in the area and decided I'll just go inside and place my order. Once, I got inside I was never greeted. They have no uniforms and you can't even tell who actually works there. I stood at the bar for minutes before I was ever approached. The girls that work there are too busy socializing, focused on how they look and playing with their hair to even notice they have customers. Finally, when I get service I am trying to tell her my order and she is walking away making drinks. But, she keeps telling me she is listening. I tried to explain to her that last week my wings were uncooked and they me wrong items in my bag. Did she even hear me no?! Because, she was too busy socializing and playing around with her coworkers. We waited over 30 minutes for our food. I was never told estimated time when my order would be out. This guys comes at the kitchen and basically throws my bag of food at us when it's finally ready. This is what made me write this review that took me over the edge. I added extra sauces at the end of my order. I paid with my debit card and I did not want to charge $1.08 on my card. I left a $1.10 in change and as I am walking out the door he is yelling smart comments . I turned around and said that was for the sauces. I already tipped her! It's a persons choice to tip or not. Even, with the poor customer service I still left her something. It wasn't much and we tipped her the other day as well. I will never go to Devil's Advocate again in my life!",

I go to Devils Advocate to listen to my favorite songs, but tonight it was just so much EDM with a few songs in between. I dont know who the new DJ is, but he definitely isn't a favorite and I heard plenty of complaints all night. We ended up leaving before 12:30 am!   Again, I love Devil's Advocate! One of my favorite bars! The bartenders and security guards are absolutely phenomenal and I get nothing but great service there whenever I go! But the music is absolutely what makes the mood, and tonight, the mood was pretty dead. I'm sure the only reason people actually stayed was to take advantage of the 2 for 1 drinks.",

The tacos on taco tuesday are the reason I come back to this place every week. Tacos range from $1-$2.50 and for being a college student that is a taco that I can afford. Not only is it cheap, but it tastes DELICIOUS too. The only problem with the tacos is that there is always a  solid chunk that manages to fall out. But maybe its the myself and not the taco LOL.   P.s. try the carnitas taco, you won't regret it  Service has usually been relatively quick and I am never waiting for an extreme amount of time for food or drinks. Staff has always been very friendly and accommodating to myself and friends. I look foward to my next experience at Devil's Advocate.   By the way if you are having drink during happy hour rum and gin well drinks are $2.50 ;)",

    "text": "Dear Riley,   (Or at least I think that's your name, since it was listed as server on the receipt.)   I did not appreciate how you spent the whole time my two friends and I were on the patio at Devil's Advocate, going out of your way to make us feel unwelcome. I did not like that you rushed our drink order, even before you dropped off the drink menu, and after we had to flag you down for service. I did not appreciate the attitude we got from you after we finished our 2nd round of drinks and wanted to hold off on the next. We had half a basket of food, some of which were on their way to our mouths, so no, we do not want our check just yet. It was unnecessary to take my napkins as I was still eating. Were they in your way?  You know, being unused and all? And it was ridiculously rude to clear our drinks, as we're sitting there,  still talking, after we just paid.  Maybe I didn't notice the non-existent line of people waiting for our table.  That's my bad. And if you felt I was rude for commenting that I wasnt done with my water just yet, as you're trying to shoo us out the door, I'm sorry.  Your insincere apology was duly noted.  I guess I didn't know that you guys ran a restaurant/bar where people left more annoyed than when they came in.  It's def one way to run a business. I'm sure many other places can take a note or two on how to make a patron feel unwelcome from you guys! Hope that strategy works for you in the long run! The only thing I do regret though, is tipping you more than 15%. If I weren't in the industry myself, you would have gotten nothing.   I honestly hope you were just having a bad day.  And that the ill treatment resulted from nothing more than that. If this is the norm though,  I'm surprised you guys have any customers at all.    Thanks, though! Tonight was memorable.  But I wouldn't do it again.",

The  staff at Devil's Advocate is amazingly friendly and attentive. I've never had a wrong food order come out and never have been dissapointed with the quality or taste of the food. Their happy hour prices are UNRIVALED and they always pour a strong drink.   In addition to the exceptional prices, atmosphere, and staff they have every sports game you can imagine available to enjoy on their tvs located anywhere your eye can wonder inside and on the patio. They have strong misters on the patio as well to keep you cool in the unforgiving AZ sun. Ive been here 20+ times and have never been let down.

I got the happy hour menu and ordered the Devils Island. Beware when drinking this! It's like a long island but better and extremely strong!   I also ordered the nachos which were pretty good. I really liked the melted cheese that they used. It was quite yummy.   I'm giving this place a 3 star because the happy menu is quite confusing. It gives you a list of items of food happy hour items, then on the back is the drink menu. However, those drinks were NOT on happy hour. So apparently mine was not. My friend ordered a regular long island and the waitress didn't even know if it was on happy hour or not. Seems like she wasn't very knowledgeable of the happy hour menu. If you go to their website they have an entirely different happy hour menu. It's quite confusing.   I think it's a really good place to hang out with friends for a drink or watch the game. I really liked my drink and nachos. I'd come back, but I definitely think they need to create a better happy hour menu for their customers and their staff needs to be more knowledgeable with it..",

It attracts students, but isn't grimey and dirty like some bars near college towns can be.  The service is always good and the food is decent for a bar.  This is a great place to meet friends and have a few drinks on the weekend or to catch the game.  I would give this place 5 stars but I went once on a Friday night and they were OUT of Bud Light.  Unacceptable.",

Lots of different seating options, so that you can choose what is most comfortable to you, but all near a TV.  Great drink prices, not your usual weak pour that accompanies such prices, and our waitress was great.  She had the perfect balance of never making you wait, but also not hovering/making you feel pressured to hurry and order more.  That made us feel comfortable hanging out, stay longer/order more, and want to go back.  How come everyone doesn't get it?  We didn't eat, but the menu looked great. We can't wait to go back, try the food, and whatever that fun looking game thingy is on the side.",

I can see how happy hour would be fun for college students.  The service and food weren't that great.  Considering we were the only people in there at 1045am, I thought they would be more attentive.  I had the Frisco burger which was way over cooked and dry.  I was surprised they didn't have a plain burger or even ask how I wanted mine cooked.  My husband had the chicken fingers which were amazing.  I ended up eating one of those because they were absolutely huge!  I would recommend those to anyone.  Our friend had the burger with the egg and onion rings and he said it was fantastic.  They do have a large selection of beer on tap and serve Coke products.  I don't think we would go back to eat, but maybe for happy hour drinks.",

I don't know if your server is doing the trick to serve the guy first because they would tip more... ...IThere're a lot of reasons I can think of, of why she did such a move--- putting the appetizers way on the side of my husband,,, in front of him... What was I???--- Table was empty except for our drinks... So what was her reason..... to all the lady servers... you don't know who handles the checkbook   :)  So my advise is to just plain respect the woman if they are with a man.....

I was going to stop in and have 1 drink with him there and then go elsewhere.   There was an employee guarding the parking lot and told us it would be $20 to park there. He said I would get my money back when I gave them the ticket when I cashed out.   I explained that I would only be having 1 drink which definitely wouldn't total $20. I asked if I would still get my whole $20 back and he said no. It wasn't at all like he explained it initially.   I'm not a college kid so I'm not willing to let a business rip me off more than usual just to have the privilege of eating in the same town as a football game that I don't care about.   I understand they probably don't care about my $6-10 tab being lost because they know that they can rip off dumb college kids all day for $20 a pop. The place wasn't really even close to being full though. It was 3 hours before the game. Your area isn't exactly a hotbed for tailgating.",

We waited to order dinner, and after a half hour, realized we did not have time to eat. We tried to order a quick appetizer, then waited another half hour and it never came. Our incorrect drink order was never corrected. Finally, we had to leave without eating, because it was time for the game to begin.

I should have known what kind of place this was when there were way too many seats open at kick off times. I ordered a beer and then I finally got it. I placed an order of \"chips and salsa\" and 20 minutes later still no chips and salsa.  Then it was kick off time and with over 30 tv monitors and over 10 different football games going on, the Cardinals were showing on every monitor. other games finally were turned on after doing some begging.  30 minutes later and still no chip and salsa! the young waitress was totally clueless and with the first day of the football season they only had 1 bartender!  My recommendation is to never go in there to watch a game or for any other reason!",

I had two tacos and a Dos Equis - $5.95 ... you cannot beat that price.  The tacos were actually above decent, so much so that I ordered another one after finishing the first round. It is a college bar, but there was a fantastic mix of people - students, locals, bikers, professionals.  The service was good (I sat at the bar) - it was busy by there were lots of follow ups and refills by the bar staff.",

You can pick your seat next which game you want to watch.  I ate the BLTA sandwich.  Plenty of bacon, nice and crispy the way I like it.  Toast just a bit too crunchy.  Onion rings on the side were delicious.  Also, tried the sweet potato fries which were very good as well.  Waitress was attentive, refilling drinks and checking in on our table.  I would go back to this bar.  Bill for four people was 36 bucks.  That was for 2 meals, a side of wings, 3 beers and several soft drinks.",

I met up with some friends to get drinks on a 2for1 night (which was dope!), The atmosphere was just as good as the drink specials. My issue was with the staff. After the bar closed at 2AM, one of the bouncers/security-guys got into an argument with a gentleman that was a little too intoxicated. One of the security guys kept escalating the situation and right as the cops were rolling up to check out the commotion, the security decided to take it a step further and tell the drunk man to \"get the fuck out of here you fucking nigger!\" I know that doesn't represent your business as a whole, but the other security guys seemed pretty chill with him blurting that out while everyone else around shook their head in dismay. As a black man, I'm not going to spend my  money at a business that hires scum like that. It's college town and the crowd was pretty diverse that night I was there with hip hop being played as well. There's no reason to have people working at your establishment,  that are supposed to act in a professional manner, calling people racial slurs. This was on Thursday 1/12 (technically 1/13 since it was 2AM).",

The beer menu has changed over the years but I have always been pleased by the variety of local brews.   They do trivia every Wednesday evening (it used to be run by Geeks Who Drink but in the past year it changed to Team Trivia). On Thursdays they have a two for one drink special after 8 pm and it gets super packed with college kids. Personally I prefer the more low-key trivia night but if you're more of a party person you'll probably like this place on Thursdays.   I did not get any food this time and it's been a while since I have actually ordered food here, but I don't really remember it, so it must not have been memorable. It is basically standard bar food options.  Parking is surprisingly very accessible despite being so close to ASU. There is a lot of parking in the back and I've never had to stress about it.",

The tacos were really good - the Mac and cheese one and the portobello mushroom ones were definitely my favorite. The tortillas were soft and for the price, the portions were generous. Our server was really friendly and attentive and the food came out quickly. The place itself has an interesting aesthetic - it felt like  a college bar that was trying to be a quiet adult bar, but in the middle of the day on a Tuesday when we went, it was a good atmosphere.

The service is prompt and nice too as they don't stand on your head and give your your space and time at the same time you don't feel neglected. There is ample parking space. Good option for vegetarians too. We opted for the patio seating on the 4th of July and enjoyed the view of fireworks while eating good food and great beer. My husband and I had a very beautiful evening here. Thank you guys!",

We came on a Friday night and there was reverse happy hour starting at 10. Before 10, they were still having normal Friday drink specials! $5 vodka and $5 jack and coke!  We were meeting up with some family and had a group of 7 people so we definitely took advantage of the specials.   I also ordered the buffalo fries and they were so good. I subbed the blue cheese for ranch no problem and everyone at the table couldn't keep their hands to themselves so we ended up having to order a 2nd batch! Yum. :)   Skylar did an awesome job serving us and being an awesome sport. My uncle and cousins were definitely having a really good time joking with her and embarrassing me, but she was such an awesome server and had a great attitude. :)",

I tried a Baja fish taco very tasty. It is a deep fried fish but was breaded very lightly. Hands down the best part is they have a portobello mushroom taco! Maybe it was my lucky day but wow who ever cooked that mushroom did a fantastic job. I also had a pork taco it wasn't my favorite but was still tasty. Lastly I had chicken green chili rolls tasty chicken but I personally would want more green chili. I think they had cheese in it as well I couldn't tell but that definitely was perfect for me. My friend had the pretzel   was warm fresh and there cheese sauce was yummy. I wish I took pictures but I guess for $1 to $2 for tacos why would I waste time eating them. Great happy hour drinks as well!!!",

I set up a nice Friday evening happy hour with a large group of friends with management's help. I asked for a few tables to reserve and they gave us the entire left side of the bar/restaurant area! Our servers were great, from the mass arrival of most of my friends, all the way til our group had been whittled down a few hours labor to just one table. There was a creeper around our group (oh happy day, before their PM security arrived) and the staff made sure to keep an eye on him until he left and drove away. Not much of a damper on our time.  Although they don't outwardly announce Friday happy hour prices, they have them 3p-7p. Your typical (carbolicious) bar food fare, mix of local and national beers, and well drinks. After a few rounds and some food, I spent roughly $30 on myself. Looks like they broadcast a variety of local and national sports too but especially heavy on the Sun Devils!",

    "text": "**Edited to reply to the Manager** *After receiving a response to my comment on Yelp, I took the time to reply to the manager through email on March 26th. My email detailed exactly why I'd written my review in the way I had and gave a further description of the waitress who'd taken our money. To clarify: I am not blaming this restaurant for the difficulty their patrons have with turning out of the bar, I am simply warning people who may come here to cautious when leaving the premises. My rating was based solely on what occurred within Devil's Advocate.   As of today, April 6th, I have no received a response from the Manager.*   There's something sketchy going on with the staff.   The best thing about this place is price and the worst is their service. Parking isn't awful, but turning west out of the parking lot is a nightmare. I only come here when we're looking for the diviest place in town, and this place always delivers.   Service: THIS was the problem. We had a middle-aged blonde serving us on a Friday night. Service was slow, and our waitress unfriendly. The worst part by far however, was her change giving ability. We had two bills at our table, and she managed to not only round down the change, but had shorted each of us a dollar. I ended up with $7 change after giving a $20 for a $11.39 bill.   I was not drunk enough to miss this. I didn't bring it up because it wasn't a big enough issue that night. Let's be clear: I would've given the waitress that dollar, and more, as a tip. It was nevertheless, a little presumptive of her to just take it.   Food: their bar food is alright. It's nothing to right home about, but they will guarantee you as much grease and carbs as your wallet and stomach can afford. The sweet potato fries are a favorite, as are their wings. Beer prices are cheap.   Moral of this story: don't expect a lot, and pay with a credit card. You won't get your change.",

I described it to my friend as a \"classy sports bar\".   Anyways, me and the boy grabbed a table and since I hadn't had dinner yet, I ordered the chicken rolls and some fries and he just had the pretzels. It was happy hour which was a plus, but the prices weren't outrageous to begin with. The description for the chicken rolls on the menu sounds far better than what they currently are (the server pointed out the change before I ordered them). They weren't terrible or anything, just pretty \"meh\" I guess. The fries were good though and they came in a huge tin. And my bf seemed to enjoy his pretzels. We had a few drinks while we were there, and there were plenty of tvs with various games on.   I can imagine when school in session how crazy busy this place is, but the business is well deserved.",

It's hard to tell where the real problem is, mainly because there are so many.  First, I think a big problem in this place is the food. The food specials are cheap ($5), but so is the quality. Every time I go in, it's difficult to know what the quality of the food will be like. I used to love their burgers, but as of late, they have been really overcooked and bland. The wings tend to be either overcooked or oversauced. Thier pizza's are just plain bad (no flavor).  Second, I think the staff is pretty cordial especially when you come in, but as time progresses, they have a tendency to make you feel rushed; especially if they are busy. Sometimes I like to just have a couple of drinks and watch the game. The second you stop drinking is when you should watch out. I actually was approached by someone that I think was a manager who basically made me feel as though I would need to either keep drinking or give up my table.  Third, I agree with others when they say that this place is kind of loud; especially at night. During the day time, it's usually pretty calm, but mainly because most days it's empty before happy hour.  On the brighter side, you can drink here pretty cheap and can always expect a heavy poor especially from certain bartenders. Monica is always one of the people to pour a nice stiff drink; sometimes with only a splash of the mixer. Don't waste your money ordering doubles, you get that and then some in most of your drinks.  In Tempe bars are a dime a dozen, and I just don't see myself making this my regular hang out spot unless it makes some serious improvements.",

Taco Tuesday is the place to be and with the amount of tv's, pool table, shoot'em up type games and great staff this is the place to go with a group of friends looking to reunite and remember all the blurry and forgotten nights again!  Being close to ASU helps to keep the crowds up if your looking for energy and during the week it cools down just enough to hold a few laughs and good convo.  I'm committed to this place for the food as well.  It's pub grub but its good pub grub damnit!!!",

Read on....  First off, it's clean.  For a bar that's down the street from a huge university (ASU), that's not an easy thing to maintain.  Clean facilities, tables, floors, glasses, etc....and we were there when it was pretty packed.  Second; our server was fantastic!  She was very nice, attentive and it didn't hurt that she was a little cutie.  She always made sure we had beers and kept checking on us through the night.  Third; food was really good.  The pizza was really, really good.  Like Italian restaurant good.  I was impressed with that fact alone.  And lastly, if you like Guinness like I do, this place served it right and it tasted great!",

    "text": "It's really a pity, because I would enjoy going there occasionally for their golden wing sauce and the laid back atmosphere. However after my last experience at this restaurant I will never trust their food again.   I had begun eating my usual order of wings, and I had eaten two or three when I noticed that the drumstick I was currently halfway through was RED and BLOODY in the center. I stopped eating immediately and pulled the other ones open and found that most of them were also undercooked to various degrees.   When I called the situation to my server's attention he carried my plate back to the kitchen for several minutes, then came back and set the SAME wings in front of me, and said \"Oh, it's alright. The cooks said those are just veins because we use such large wings. So it's a good thing.\"  (Note- not even entire rotisserie chickens are supposed to be bloody in the middle.) I argued this point with him and explained why undercooked poultry is a big deal, and even showed him that the meat and bone was still oozing blood. Then he tried to tell me it couldn't possibly be undercooked because they deep fry their chicken for several minutes and then bake them for about 20 minutes more. Which is absolutely ridiculous because then they would be so overcooked they'd be inedible. Apparently a manager got involved and my check got voided so I wouldn't complain, so I left after only a few bites. But what upsets me the most about the whole situation is not the mistake that was made, but the fact that the server kept trying to convince me to keep eating something that could have given me food poisoning, and even tried to pass it off as a sign of quality. Luckily I did not get sick from the little bit I did eat.   Perhaps he just ran plates and was clueless about proper food safety, but a corrupt kitchen staff is even worse. Maybe my experience was an isolated one, but I would advise all patrons to look at their chicken very carefully before swallowing.",

If i had it my way i would not come back to this establishment for the life of me. I am not a horny college kid that is here to stare at girls in shorts and their boobs all night.  They have a decent Thursday night special on drinks but i am over that stage in my life where i want to go out and get wasted and drink til i cannot remember type B.S. I would rather go somewhere get a good deal on better beer and wine and have maybe one or two drinks tops with DELICIOUS food. Not crummy food. How can you have a special going on and have nasty food? I think the reason people give such high scores is for 1. The Girls 2. Their drink specials 3. they are drunk and love the food. Yeah its like all the drunken idiots that love Denny's. Seriously? Denny's? Get out of here with that! \"Nobody goes to Denny's, People end up at Denny's\"  If it were me drinking like these college kids and looking to go out i would rather drink at home to pre game and save money then  go to the bars. That is just me I am thinking logically at the moment!    As i am looking at the reviews on the right hand side majority of my top 3 ideas as to why people are giving such high ratings and i can bet you one other thing is because they are single and have all the time in the world to come here for that special that isn't as great as it used to be. Anytime my boyfriend brings up the name i cringe and want to stay home.",

The waitress was friendly and took our drink orders quickly, but then disappeared for a long time when we were ready to order food. I think she may have been the only waitress on duty, since she was helping people on the far side of the restaurant area. It was pretty slow, but that's stretching it a little thin.  I ordered a BLT and sweet potato fries. Both sounded good, but didn't look so great when they arrived. The bread was grilled rather than toasted, so it was a little greasy and otherwise limp. I was happy that they served the mayo on the side, though a little cup of mayo is kind of unappealing to see. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, but the bacon was really odd. It was very similar to the kind of bacon you'd get in England, which is to say that it's sort of like Canadian bacon for pizza. Not crisp, greasy, stringy. Yuck. The sweet potato fries were pretty unappealing too. They were hot but limp and not particularly flavorful.  The ambiance and decor was good, so if you're wanting a drink, it probably wouldn't be an issue. I liked the comfy chairs around the bar, and there were TVs everywhere so it'd be a great place for watching sports. (They had a World Cup game on but the broadcast was in Arabic, which makes zero sense to me.)",

Honestly, it seemed to be filled with mostly old single men customers who were harassing the waitresses and the promoter girls. Plus, we just weren't impressed with the beer list or the food. The only plus was that they double booked two different promoters so we got two free shots.",

I went in with my son and a friend and we walked in the front door seen several servers just standing around so we sat ourselves on the outside patio. It's 6:40pm at the time we take our table \"they are slightly busy\" and we are hoping for a server to come over however; a group of 5 walk right in and get served. So we wait another 5 minutes  hoping to get served granted they are getting busy ...now it's 7pm we waited 20 minutes to get one server who was amazing but still took 20 minutes because the other girls that were to help on the patio didn't think we were good to be served. So to fast forward we ordered the chips and guacamole on the happy hour menu only to have my friend grab a bit and low and behold there is a Thumb tack that she bit on while eating \"granted this is the first scoop of the guacamole\" we proceed to let our server know Immediately and ask for the manager on duty. Well the manager comes out and we let her know about the thumb tack and she proceeds to answer with \" I'm not sure how that got in there since we don't use them in or at our store\"..... welll ummmmm look it's right here in your face so next! However what went from a place that I did a recommend I will not anymore just due to the comment the manger said. I'm saddened by this but it Could have been worse if my son had the chips and guacamole first. They did comp what we ordered and we stilled tipped our waitress 20% because it wasn't her fault but just double check your food if you do plan on going to this establishment.",

Updated 2017, same shit years later.",

I would suggest my favorites the taco Tuesday $1 taco and $2 Mexican beer deal and also the very popular 2-4-1 Thursday's!! This is the best bar in Arizona and I'm sure many other states so trust me done waste your money or time and go there! Also, try the sweet potato frys!!!",

I love mill more than I care to admit, but this place allows you to see a familiar face and have a legitimate conversation. A seemingly impossible task on mill or in old town. Long after graduating I have come to this place and never fail to see someone I know. This place is an icon in the ASU community.",

Unfortunately, we stopped in here for a quick lunch on our way to an ASU hockey game. We had 45 minutes & it wasn't enough time.  The service started fine. We had sodas pretty quickly. But then it was another 10 to order, and another 30 to get our food. The food was terrible. We ordered the cheese sticks which were cold, and not melted at all on the inside. They were served on a gross piece of lettuce that was still wet. My BLT also had the wet nasty lettuce, and bacon crumbles... not even a strip of bacon. Hubby's sammy was also gross. However my son liked his wings. All in all - don't bother with this place unless you want wings & beer.",

You get the pic, we've all been there and most of us don't want to go back (unless you're douchey frosted tip, 40yr old azucar papa chasing young tail). However, the food here is awesome!!! And served late .  No they don't have osso bucco, it's bar food, so think fried, saturated fat ladden, almost zero nutritional value food and it is SPECTACULAR!!! No triple fried wings here.  So if you're old like me, go get drunk elsewhere and then on your way home in a drunken stupor, at around 10pm or so, come here to crash the party and load up on grease. Zucchini, wings, chicken tenders, fries dear God, clog my arteries with this deliciousness. Plus watching kids act a fool while waiting is entertaining and makes you feel glad you're settled for boring and more liver friendly lifestyle.  I will be back!",

To pay for it, I gave her $21 and she never gave me any chance. 15 minutes later, I asked for it and she said she didn't know and thought I'd ask for my $10 if I wanted it back.

Sometimes, they have good servers, other times you'll be lucky to get service within a half an hour. Their tator tots are usually good. They give you free refills on juice if you're not a big drinker and their pizzas are usually pretty good. I also like their Frisco Burger. That being said, the food here is usually super greasy to the point of god why did I eat that. Again there's exceptions, but most of the wraps are just kinda meh. If you order a Cobb Salad - good god its the size of a toddler's head, its good but jeez louise its massive. Hard to have conversations here sometimes because of how loud it is, but it is neighborhood-y and doesnt feel like a chain, so hazzah for ambiance.  Final verdict: ordering a pizza is your best bet, the Hawaiian and Spinach pizzas are the best ones, the high top chairs can sometimes be uncomfortable and the tables wobble a lot. Peace out.",
