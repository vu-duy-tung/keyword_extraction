I also ordered the family tots they were cold and mushy, the bacon was crispy, but it could not save the dish. The beer cheese on the tots tastes like a beer, I could not taste any cheese.  When staff came to ask how meal was I said it was meh and he awkwardly removed our plates. No words were said. Staff overall is friendly and food was served quickly.",

The sandwich, with bacon, was good. The maple glaze adds a nice touch. The tater tots were horrible. They were greasy and clearly sitting around too long as they were barely luke warm. I'd try them once more but another crazy wait with non-hot food and I won't return (Ike's never lets me down).",

I had the Reuben and it was so delicious, tasty rye bread from local Noble Bread, crispy red cabbage kraut and not too overloaded with sauce.  The salad had fresh blueberries and granola over field greens with a very yummy vinaigrette dressing. If you are a fan of tater tots try them party style with bacon and avocado! They also offer breakfast too which I hope to try out soon.",

However upon sitting down at a table for a quick bite before a concert we were immediately told that they were out of a few things on the menu, which that's fine I get it, busy night. But then when we tried to order some small bites we were told no Brussels sprouts, no shishito peppers, no grilled cheese?! It's only 7pm on a Saturday! We then waited nearly twenty minutes for a small bowl of baked mac and cheese which I'm nearly positive didn't have real cheese (came out barely warm to the touch) and was topped with cold tomato slices and fatty bacon pieces and a hummus plate with pita bread that definitely wasn't freshly baked. I hope management gets with the program and realizes restaurant season is just about in full swing and if they continue having nights like this, I wish them luck. Probably won't be back.",

We drove around a good bit before we could a spot. Once inside though, it was a really wonderful experience! They had live music on a sunny Sunday afternoon although there weren't very many people inside. I checked in on Yelp and received a free cookie so that was a sweet treat! I was so excited to see that they served shishito peppers so we ordered that to start and then I ordered the Hummazing Vegan. I understand that hummus was the star to this sandwich, but I was overwhelmed by the amount of hummus there was! It tasted great with all of the other layers, but I wound up scraping a lot of it off. Another thing we noticed was the huge amount of homeless people that hung out right outside the storefront and we were asked for money constantly to and from our car. I would have loved if this place had a better location!",

Highly recommend this place.",

The major downfalls of our visit was that the sandwich I came here for was not available... and then the soup I wanted was out... and then they were out of soda cups. The establishment has some things to work on, but I enjoyed the grilled cheese that I ended up ordering very much. It has jalapenos inside which gives it a bit of spice. A salad is included and that was pretty average with just some greens, a couple tomatoes and I believe a type of balsamic dressing. I think you can opt for chips instead but I can't remember. I also ordered a side of Mac and cheese that had tomatoes and bacon in it, the bacon was really good, definitely freshly cooked and not bacon bits. The mac and cheese wasn't that good to me, I wouldn't order it again. My guest ordered the Brussels sprouts and those were tasty. They also ordered the capreezy sandwich and they enjoyed it very much. The staff was attentive and pleasant. They were apologetic for the missing menu items and lack of soda cups. Parking is difficult at this downtown location but if you come at a good time there are a couple meter  spots right out front. Definitely worth a try!",

You walk into a huge inviting space with super awesome decor and staff that are all smiles. I took a look over the menu and knew the Bahn Mahi was the one for me. Went with house made chips and a fountain drink for only $11, very happy with that!   Meant to get a shot of the food, but as soon as it was brought to me I couldn't resist digging in! Tons of yummy grilled fish, all the flavors of a bahn mi, and a perfectly toasted bun made this one of the BEST I've had. So good. My mom got the wedge salad and loves it with avocado salsa, looked really good. Overall, great spot. Oh, and my friend who I sent in told me they have the BEST Rubuen he's ever had- so there's that too!   Did I mention that by eating a sandwich there, they donate to a nonprofit to help feed someone in need? Eat to give!",

    "text": "Stopped by even Stevens to grab a quick sandwich before going to the airport.  All experience I had here was terrible.   1. It's a sandwich place you don't want to wait 30 minutes for your food which is the time it took for me to get the food.  2 I was facing away from the table and somehow they had put the food down behind me and I never heard them or saw them. The waiter claims that she told me as she was serving, but they have loud music playing in the background. Plus if the person hasn't even looked at their food for 5-10minutes wouldn't you check up on them? 3. Not knowing my food was served I went up to the cashier to ask to cancel my order because it had been 40 minutes since I had ordered and he had a very bad attitude. Blaming that I had my headphones in and didn't hear the waiter. I had one headphone in on the side of ear not facing the cashier/waiter. There was no apologies. 4. Food.  I ordered a humus sandwich with tater tots and Brussels sprouts. You get 3 sauces with the tater toys and they were all bad. Tater tots themselves were crispy. Humus sandwich was a soggy mess. Flavors were okay. The Brussels sprouts was really bad. It was bathing in a pool of water/oil and not crispy at all. It was hard to chew. Not soft 5. One good experience is they have live music. Hence 2 stars.  I would NOT come back to even Stevens next time in back in Phoenix.",

I had never heard of this place before, but free food and good company and I am there! He also told me he would explain the concept upon arrival. I wasn't exactly sure what to make of that!  first off, parking does suck. but it downtown so I guess every place sucks for parking! the place is pretty small, tucked in a corner unit under a parking garage. Super cute decor (we were lucky enough to meet their designer who is insanely talented I might add). I really liked the simplicity of the menu, some times too many options aren't a good thing.   I got the sprang chicken sandwich minus the greens, which comes with a side of chips. the food was amazing. it tasted great, and also like I was eating something healthy for once. Generous portion too, I felt. Price point is right where everyone else is at. They do have a kids menu, but as of prior to opening it was on a small menu board behind the register, not their large one posted on the wall. Again, fair prices and generous portion on that as well.  the best part of a place like this is not only do they have great food, they have a great cause as well. for every sandwich you purchase, one is donated to one of 4 (I think) companies they are partnered with. For once, I wont feel guilty being a pig and ordering more than I should!   great food, location, people and cause? a win all around, Rae will be back!!!",

And let me also add, I am not gluten free by choice - more like my body hates me.  I order my chicken sandwich on gluten free bread to go, walk back to my office several blocks away and take two bites before I realize that the bread on my sandwich matches the bread in the normal menu description, which is a red flag because one size does not fit all when it comes to gluten-less types. Sure enough, I call and they confirm that the gluten-free modifications were not made. They do offer to have another ready for me on the gluten free bread if I want to come back, however. So I walk all the way back, get a quick apology and exchange food for my new sandwich only to find a half thrown together sandwich that they could not take the extra two seconds to cut in half.   I do not mean to complain, because the flavor of the food was good but if you have a gluten allergy, beware. Cheers to getting sick for the next several days!   I even tipped on a to-go order. You'd think they'd at least try... :(",

I also ordered a mimosa and paid for it before they told me they were out of champagne. So they gave me a beer which was cheaper than what I paid for the mimosa.   We also got party tots and they looked amazing but they were just kind of warm and tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. Even the melted cheese that was on top was dry and I know that wouldn't happen if they were freshly made.   The atmosphere is pretty cool though and they have some good board games so we played some games and had a good time. And the staff is super nice. The food needs improvement though.

We were lucky to find parking spot in front of the joint and fed the meter $2 via credit card and were excited to check the place out.  Unfortunately,  as we entered the restaurant we encountered a horrible sewage or rotten egg sulfar-kind of smell.  In less than a minute we decided to leave instead of ordering.  The stink was too bad to take a chance at eating this food much less staying in that building.    I'm not trying to hate on this place... maybe they were having issues that day... but the first thing you smell should not be a rotten stench but delicious food.  YMMV.",

I went to order one the Cashier stated they don't have mimosas. On the plus side they have live music on Sundays. The musician was really good. They also donate a sandwich to a local charity for every sandwich bought.    This is not a restaurant I would be dying to visit again.",

Corned beef was incredibly flavorful and tasty, and the marble rye bread was great.  Absolutely delicious.  Cindy had the Mihami Vice (aka Cubano), and said it was really good.  I cheated and tased a bite of it,  and i agree.  It's a pretty classic Cuban sandwich with pulled pork, ham, and pickles on a baguette, and according to Cindy is a definite \"eat again.\"  Friendly, cheerful staff who were very helpful to a couple of first time visitors was a great bonus.",

I guess they're aiming for that hipster vibe.I was a little upset because I ordered the blueberry steel salad which comes with feta cheese but instead It had blue cheese which I always try to avoid for its strong flavor and don't understand because there was about two other customers besides me(on a Tuesday around 2 pm).

Plus a $1 Coors in the van for good measure.  (Can you beat that?!) Our pretzels arrived promptly and were holy moly amazing. The pretzels were warm and soft and perfectly salty, and the beer cheese was out of this world. I wanted to live inside it. Get this if you go, you HAVE TO! The sandwiches arrived shortly afterward and were equally delicious. The woman working at the front was bubbly and kind and very helpful to two out of towners. I highly recommend a stop at This awesome place! Yum!!!",

The problem doesn't seem to be isolated to the kitchen as the check out line takes too long as well.

My only reason for not giving them five stars is because they could have done one, minor thing better in the customer service department. I didn't know the difference between the Grad and Undergrad breakfast burrito, so I asked. I was told that the description was in the menu, but she didn't hand me one. I had to get the menu myself. An excellent customer service response would have been to hand me a menu while telling me the difference between the two. Good food is great to have, but the customer service must be excellent as well. However, that minor issue didn't stop me from eating there again and again.",

I spent $14 on a drink, sandwich, and Mac n cheese. Not really an issue except that the turkey day was extremely average almost as if my mother had made it for a school lunch. The Mac n cheese was literally lukewarm, basically equal to the room temperature, if not below. I went to an event at the Van Buran after this and while just standing there my stomach begun to hurt very badly. Something was just not correct with this meal.

Oh yeah, then let's add the grilled Jack fruit sandwich to that order which comes on a super soft bun and packed with flavor...tasty. lastly, for desert let's throw in a freshly baked sugar cookie smeared with a buttercream spread on top of it that are both whipped up and made in house. Solid experience with live solo acoustic music and friendly customer service. Thoroughly enjoyed.",

Their banh mi is insanely tasty with slow cooked pork belly as the meat and tons of fresh veggies..... I liked it so much, I asked for that same meat in a breakfast burrito....guys..... trust me...it's so good! Nothing like pork belly and tator tots mmmmm.  The portions are large and I always have leftovers. I can also get out of there easily under 10$. Complaints? Parking is a bit rough (not their fault, but a factor) and I think they may have changed their coffee....it used to be really good and the last time I went....not so much. Those are fairly minor issues though and I would 100% recommend you give this place your business.",

Their buns - mcgriddle style with the syrup infused,but burger king style with the croissant texture, must appreciate.   Also on point is their grilled cheese and tomato soup.

Arcade game when you walk in.  Breakfast is served all day. The boyfriend got the breakfast burrito with pork belly, super filling and yummy. The salsa was super fresh and yummy. Kids got kids meals which came with a side and a drink. Would have like to seen more nondairy options on the menu but still had a couple of choices. Had a couple other menu items that were also yummy. Everything was really fresh. Pricing is very reasonable.   If you check in with yelp you can get a free cookie. I got a non dairy chocolate creme pookie pie. For serious this pookie pie was absolutely amazing. I have since researched the business that makes them (city cakes). I didn't realize it was non dairy until half way through when the lactose free child wanted a bite of my delicous goodness.   There is a parking garage literally next door and tons of metered parking around the block.  You can get unlimited french toast for $4 on Sundays. Oh and $3 mimosas. You can also get some cheap local brewery beers too. San tan brewery as an example.  Defitinely will be back!",

The sandwich was awesome I also had some tots with my meal which are pretty big and filling. I ended up taking it to go for the road but over all the food was good. It's a nice artsy location.

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a young lady in her early 20s and who took my order.

My personal favorite sandwich is the Do Gouda and subbing the chips for tater tots with beer cheese.  Yes, the food is great, but what really impresses me about this place is the customer service. I am gluten free (not by choice, by serious need) and the gluten free bread is great. However, one time my friend ordered for me and forgot to say GF bread. I called Even Stevens to let them know and they had me come back so that they could give me a new sandwich free of charge. It was completely my/my friend's fault but Even Stevens fixed it themselves.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal and good vibe, all at a reasonable price! Thank you Even Stevens!! I'll be back again and again and again!",

I got the Spranger Chicken Sandwich with gluten free bread. It was was very good and filling. Their service was very good as well. One thing I'm not a fan of was how they have an option for tips. They turn the monitor over and have you choose no tip, 18%,20% or 25%. Felt awkward choosing no tip. I'm a big believer in tipping waiters not cooks and cashiers. If they want tips they can become a server. Servers make less than minimum wage and work hard to receive tips.",

I cannot review the food because we placed our order for French toast, paid, then sat down. The person who took our order came over and said they ran out of bread. So we went back to the cashier and got a credit and re-ordered a beet salad. We paid and sat down. Five minutes later he came back and said they ran out of beets. So we got another credit and left. Looks like a pretty cool place but has a very limited menu. Also some very unsavory characters were in there which made the place seem very unappetizing.  The gentleman at the cash register was VERY nice but he should've been better informed by the kitchen about what items they ran out of or what they still had to offer. I'm hoping that my two credits went through because I didn't get a receipt for either transaction. Also the music was much too loud! We kept moving tables to see if we could find a place not under a loud speaker but it was impossible!",

Don't lie to customers, just own up to losing my order.  Still another 7 minutes goes by before I get my burrito and it's not very good, kinda bland, including the salsa they provide. Sorry, but the service and the food are not worth the frustration or disappointment.  Like that they give back, but I won't be back.",

The meats are all incredibly tender and the sauces are succulent and unique. When you walk in you'll notice the staff are smiling and full of life. Very happy with this place! Wish there was one in SoCal! This particular location has a fitting farm theme that matched this history of the surrounding area. One of the coolest things about this restaurants is that they donate one sandwich to a charity for every sandwich that is sold. You can see the amount of sandwiches sold on the wall for this store as well as nationally across all of their stores. Giving back is great, but giving back while eating a delicious sandwich is much more rewarding. This branch has been open a few months and donated over 6000 sandwiches to charity. Nationally they have donate almost a million in 2 years.",

For every sandwich that is sold, the shop donates an equal amount of sandwich materials to various nonprofits in Arizona. There was a fairly steady line when we got here around lunchtime but it moved pretty fast and we got our orders quickly.  I had the hummanizing sandwich with the side salad. The sandwich had lightly toasty bread, hummus, and vegetables. It was supposed to be on wheat bread but it looked like they used the same French bread that my friend had on her turkey day sandwich. The flavors worked well together. The side salad had fresh mixed greens, grape tomatoes and a lightly sweet vinaigrette.  Overall it was a decent sandwich and we were done just in time to get back from our hour lunch. There are better sandwich places in this area but for the price and quick service Even Stevens is a good choice.",

I came here for lunch and I would imagine that this place is not busy at all during dinner since most of the business is on lunch. They have very nice seating area inside which includes standard tables but they also have a sofa area which could be for some intimate setting. I believe there are outdoor seatings as well which includes bar height seats watch the street. If you are a solo, I think that's a perfect way to eat and people watch.   It is a good place to come in for a bite or a sandwich. They have variety of choices from sandwich, wrap, soups and Mac & Cheese as well. I would definitely recommend this place and I will be here on and off.   I also think that they serve a breakfast but it's not very popular so if they can capitalize on that, that's an additional revenue stream which can be added to their existing business.   I have been here couple of times and it's pretty hip place however I didn't experience any wow movement so I am giving them a four stars.",

    "text": "Buy a sandwich, feed someone in need.  It's not unusual for restaurants to engage in benevolent causes every so often, but shaping an entire business model around such a cause is almost unheard of.  No wonder then why Even Stevens has grown from it's Salt Lake City roots to now (as of me writing this) 10 locations in less than 3 years, including 3 locations in Arizona.  Their Downtown Phoenix location is well positioned to take advantage of the Downtown breakfast and lunch crowd as well as the growing number of nearby college students.  And yeah benevolence is great and all, but how's the food?  I made my way here after work on a Thursday afternoon.  The Downtown Phoenix location is on the southeast corner of 1st Avenue & Van Buren, just a short stroll from the ASU Downtown campus and an even shorter stroll from the main Downtown bus and light rail stations.  Despite a relatively small looking footprint on the outside, the restaurant itself is actually quite large and spacious.  Seating for easily 100 people including some couch seating as well as patio seating outside.  In fact one of the smallest components of the restaurant might well be the front counter where you order.  I'd done my homework in advance and decided I'd go with a Sprang Chicken sandwich for my first venture here.  Chicken, provolone cheese, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, cucumbers, mixed greens, and honey mustard sauce on toasted multi grain bread.  Also comes with a pickle and your choice of chips or a salad (chips for me).  Total cost including tax: $10.  Came out to my outside patio seat in about 5 minutes.  Sandwich was excellent.  Loved the texture and the crunch of the multi grain bread, chicken was cooked perfectly, and the bacon, greens, and cheese were in abundance.  I also have to say I really liked the chips.  I'm not sure which brand they used, but tasted like old school kettle chips.  Much heartier and crunchier than your average Lay's.  Big thumbs up for this creation.  Back to that whole benevolence thing.  As I mentioned, Even Stevens helps feed those in need for every sandwich you buy.  At the end of every month they tally up sandwich sales and a portion of the proceeds go to fund sandwich ingredients which are then donated to local nonprofits who then make the sandwiches and give them to those in need.  For their 3 AZ locations, Even Stevens has teamed up with Saint Mary's Food Bank for this project.  As of me writing this, over 17,000 sandwiches have been donated to the food bank.  So to recap, great sandwiches from a restaurant that shapes its business model around literally giving right back to the community.  The Downtown location in particular is a welcome addition and has sandwich options to satisfy the myriad of folks and tastes that walk and drive by this intersection everyday.  My sandwich was already delicious regardless, but its nice to eat a good meal and feel good about doing so.  And I'd imagine many will frequent here both for the food and as a thank you to business model.  Even Stevens may be a Utah creation, but the concept is sure to have a faithful following here in the valley and elsewhere.",

    "text": "Even Stevens is new to the valley, and I hadn't heard of them prior to their AZ expansion.  After hearing about their cause (for every sandwich sold, they donate a sandwich/its fixings to charity), I was excited to give them my business.   They have 3 dedicated vegan sandwiches, marked with a tomato icon on the menu. They have some salads which can be tweaked to be made vegan. The Brava Tots can be made vegan upon request (they'll just add vegan brava instead of the vegetarian brava sauce).   They currently do not have any vegan desserts, but a PR rep and a chef informed me that a chocolatey vegan dessert will be coming soon. Yay!  At this location, I have had The New Morrissey three times. It has been different each time.  The first time was perfection: the wrap was toasted and warm, the perfect amount of veggies were added and it was delicious.  The next 2 times it wasn't toasted and didn't taste as amazing. One of the times they forgot the jalapenos and avocado/guacamole that I had added (and paid for), and there was an overload of carrots, which overpowered the other flavors.  The missing items were brought out a la carte after I mentioned they'd been forgotten.   The tater tots are so good with the vegan garlic brava mixed with ketchup. Napoleon would approve.  The restaurant space is large and open. There is an outdoor patio area, which will be a hit when it warms up again.  The music here is banger! I end up dancing in my seat every single time I'm here. I suggested they host a karaoke night once a week or so; it'd be a hit!  They have one of those soda machines with the 101 flavor mix options (disclaimer: I do not know if there are actually 101 flavors, but there are a lot), and they have crushed ice here.  Being a downtown location, my only complaint is the darn parking.  They initially were validating parking at 100% of the cost, but something happened with the building management and the validation was reduced to a discount of like a few cents. This gave me major side eye, but it's not the restaurant's fault. I was informed that they are trying to rectify this.  Cool concept, friendly staff, yummy vegan options, and reasonably priced. I'm sure the cooks are still trying to get accustomed to the menu, so I expect that I'll be able to update to a 5-star review once the inconsistencies have been addressed.",

My kids occupied their time by playing Guess Who, the 1988 retro edition.   The best part was really the food. My kids were happy with the macaroni and cheese with chips. Added bonus- a crisp pickle. My mom and I had the sandwich and soup which was also tasty and my hubby had a breakfast sandwich. The food was delicious and the was welcoming. Loved it!",

    "text": "I've been here twice, and have loved it both times! First things first: 1) If you're a student, show them your ASU ID and get a free coffee. 2) Check-in and get your cookie. The oatmeal chocolate is delish, as is the frosted sugar cookie. 3) HOW COOL IS IT THAT THEY DONATE A MEAL FOR EACH SANDWICH YOU BUY?!!?! I can't get over that.   Service: This place is on point with their service. The people are friendly and always have a smile and suggestion for what to get. They do a great job getting your food out to you on time, and making sure that everything is okay if you're eating in.   Food: The Reuben is our go to. It's melty goodness on cumin-studded rye bread. The bacon is delightfully flavorful and the dressing pulls it all in together. It's served with either a side said (delicious), or chips (delicious, but too salty). It's a pretty greasy sandwich, so be prepared for that. Oh, and maybe schedule a workout in for that day. The pickles are yummy and free!  I've also tried the Turkeyday: the turkey is good, but the red pepper(?) jam isn't my favourite. I wish there was more cranberry flavour, and stuffing!!! Oh, and maybe some mashed potatoes. I'm really looking forward to Thanksgiving you guys.   We bought our friend a Chicken and Beet salad, and it was a huge portion! The croutons were freshly made, and my friend said that even half of it was super filling.  Ambiance: Tons of seating available inside and on the patio. There's a strange retro-modern vibe happening. Not sure how they managed to make it work, but it does.   I'll be back. Maybe every week. It's that good. I really want to try the brunch items and the small bites.",

The resturant is very cutesy and convenient, it's right by all the music venues so it was semi crowded when we went. It was a clean facility, and the staff were pleasant to deal with.   When I went up to order, I ordered a basic sandwich and asked what sides they offered. She told me all the sides, and I picked the fruit cup. Little known to me, it was $2 extra. Which was NOT told to me. And not on a sign that I could clearly see (I will admit, I'm visually impaired).   I shrugged it off and sat down, my friend ordered and had the same thing happen, not being told what sides are extra.   When we got our food, we were happy with the portions but both of our sides were incredibly lackluster.   The Mac and cheese she ordered was LUKEWARM! Not even hot, it was a small small portion of it. We were in rush so we did not complain. Plus staff was nowhere to be found at this point.  My fruit was not worth $2, the blueberries were very mushy, the pineapple was good but it had such small slices.   Afterwards, we both started to feel ill. Our stomachs were extremely upset. We both ordered the same sandwich (I forgot the name but I do know it was the chicken one).  I expected more from Even Stevens due to its high reviews. I will not be returning.",

Don't let the Buy One, Give One idea lead you down the skeptic isle, the food totally holds its own, it's well priced and no Even Stevens venues are identical!  I just ran into one of their GM's by luck at a Starbucks and decided to sit down and have a chat. (he was geared out from head to toe in ES gear... which by the way, they make pretty sweet shirts)  He gave me the scoop on the concept idea, and that every location they open, the interior is designed on its local traits and history!  How cool is that?  Why go there: The sandwiches are just awesome, it's well priced and what comes with it will make your meal worth it for the $10-$12.  They are fast and consistent.  All locations support local food banks and other charities close by.  It's just an awesome thing to be part of simply by eating there.  Don't miss: The pun'd crown jewel of the place: The Do Gouda.    5 stars y'all keep up the good work.  Yelpers, check in and get a free cookie!",

I always prefer to eat outside and the patio is my favorite spot. My biggest issue is my latest to go order I placed last night. I opened the bag and they had added quacamole, some type of crushed potato chips, I think, and they ADDED the wrong type of cheese and NO DRESSING. Also, I noticed sometimes I get a huge amount of pork belly and last night I found literally mere specs of it. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but can't just yet.

I will definitely be going back to try some of their other options.",

Tip tho don't get this to go. By the time I ate it the bread was soggy from the jus (although still really good) and I imagine it would have been excellent fresh in the restaurant.  4 stars because if quality but not 5 because too expensive.",

Then there's the yummy hummus and the avocado, the arugula, and vinaigrette.  A couple of other things that I cant remember but all in all truly a hummazing sandwich.

My meal was just shy of $14.00, a little pricey, however,  for every sandwich ordered \"Even Stevens\" will donate one sandwich to the needy.  My meal arrived quickly.   The tots were good as was the sandwhich and salad. The sandwich, had a crunchy baguette, was flavorful and juicy, with plenty of pot roast.

And, they are great at substituting ingredients to make almost everything on the menu vegan! It's a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix!  My two favorites are the Hummazing Vegan (red pepper hummus sandwich - yum!) and the New Morrissey (jackfruit and tots in a breakfast burrito!). Both are vegan as-is. The Jackfruit Torta is as well. You can also get the tots made vegan (ask for extra crispy, of course). The cost is a bit high, but the sandwiches are big enough to split or take half home. Plus, it's good to know that part of the $$ is given back to local community organizations.   Service is always great, and they've only messed up my order once (I ordered online and it wasn't very good at handling changes). They've also provided free food for a student group at ASU that I supported, so I know their charitable efforts aren't just talk! And, for those that care about these things, they have the \"good ice\" (small little ice crunches). The dining area is comfortable and some of the booths have power outlets, so it's a great place to hang at for awhile as well. Highly recommended for downtown quick bites!",

They also serve alcohol and have a happy hour, though I think all their booze options are canned. Can't say I've tried. This is more of a workday lunch spot.   On the positive side, portions are good and takeout is reasonably quick. There's more of an ambiance than Subway, for sure.   They have vegetarian options and very limited vegan options but beware- I ordered the seasonal vegetable as a side and those brussel sprouts were choked in an overly thick, sweet sauce and covered in bacon. That's probably great for getting a kid to eat their veggies but if you're actually health-conscious or meat-averse, you should be able to get a side of \"seasonal veggies\" that works for you. Sadly, not here.",

Saucy tots and Party tots...who doesn't love a good tator tot?!  The service was polite, fast, and fun and the restaurant was virtually empty.  I've been here for lunch when it was packed.

We were the first customers but despite feeling half asleep, I was really impressed with everything about this spot. First, affordable!! Only $6 for stuffed french toast with berries?! We each only paid $10 for our meals. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which came in a deliciously soft yet crispy Hawaiian bun. I went semi vegetarian by having it with egg, avocado & no cheese. The tater tots were nothing special but for $7.95 this was a lot of food. I was amazed most of their menu can be turned vegan/vegetarian at a low cost. The design of the place is unique and most importantly the food tasted fresh and homemade (not greasy). The staff was very friendly, and helpful! Definitely recommend it for a quick breakfast or lunch!",

    "text": "Sandwich was good, but not a True Ruben. Very light on the meat, which was great tasting, but more like pot roast in flavor than corned beef. It was over powered by the red cabbage kraut. Most disappointing was that my last few bites was nothing but bread and kraut. Great quality of meat, however.  I love tots, but mine weren't as crisp as most. Loved having 3 dipping sauces, but I'll stick to the house sauce, which was very tasty. There was a cold sauce, like a flavored sour cream, which didn't bode as well with hot tots. The beer cheese soup was a huge fail, leaving a very bitter taste afterwards. Maybe they used  a beer that is more stout than I like. It certainly was not the caliber of beer cheese soup found in Michigan.  Prices were higher than those I saw in photos prior to dining here, but not too bad. I'll certainly return and try other meals. I'm also posting the latest prices.  Love the atmosphere and the collection of games. Found the music they played quite annoying, mostly bubble gum pop and rap. Drove me out sooner than I had hoped. Nice outdoor dining area and the cashier was sooper nice and helpful...a fellow Houstonian. All in all, this was A-ok!",

    "text": "I visited this spot for breakfast. They had nice covered outdoor seating, but since I was not used to the Arizona heat, I went inside for my breakfast.  The inside was quite large, with lots and lots of seating options. Since the spot is located at the corner lot, it was very bright in the inside with natural light.   To the left of the entrance is the order counter. When I walked in around 8:30am, it was empty... I was expecting some king of a morning rush, but I don't think I saw a single soul in here... But, that didn't stop me from getting my breakfast.  I ordered a Breakfast Sandwich that comes with two eggs and choice of meat or avocado, cheddar cheese on Hawaiian Bun. For meat, I wanted pork belly, but the staff told me that they don't offer pork belly option any more...how sad...  The sandwich was pretty darn tasty! Hawaiian bun was like a softer pretzel buns, with little sweetness to it. The eggs were fluffy, and bacon strips were crunchy, cloud-like buns...yum! Another thing I loved was that it came with tater tots instead of home fries. The tater tots were nothing really special, but comforting. It was quite filling, I took about half of it back with me.   Another treat I got was their sugar cookie, for FREE!!! How? Well, I checked in at this spot with Yelp, and it gave me a free cookie! Yes! Thank you Yelp!   The staff here was not very friendly, but nice enough and willing to help.",

I almost swallowed it whole and was tempted to order another, and in my excitement actually spilled half the au jus on my lap. Oops. Macaroni needed a little pepper but was creamy, full, and warm.   Might stop by again during my short stay in Phoenix.",

    "text": "First time at this Even Stevens. I arrived for lunch at 11:30 on a Wednesday and the line was 8 deep with 20 eating. It took me 15 mins to get to the register tho.   No paper menus in sight, I had to order based on the title of the sandwich. Big miss there. I ordered the Mihami Vice and a soft drink for $11.50. It came with salad or plain kettle chips.   My lunch arrived in 15 minutes, five minutes after the lady behind me in line got hers. Hmm, miss.   There was really, really loud music. With the concrete floors, wood walls and plaster ceiling, it was nearly impossible to converse. For a downtown spot, another miss.   Excellent sandwich: crusty bread, plenty of ham, pulled pork, cheese and aioli, plus pickle spears. Service was adequate but nothing notable.   Please turn down the music!  Return visit. Got there right at 11 on a Tuesday and there was one other customer.   I ordered the Do Gouda, which had NY strip plus Gouda cheese, lettuce, onions and aioli on toasted sourdough.   Thank God the music was lower. Actually it probably wasn't but they had all the doors and windows open so there was a lot of ambient street noise.   My lunch arrived in 5 mins. I chose the salad over chips this time. Neither one was a very tasty option, so they offered a side-sub for $2. Good idea but I'd rather they fix the basic sides.   The sandwiches are okay here but not memorable. I love the community concept but wish the food was better.",

It's like TOMS shoes, but with your lunch.   Anyway, it's convenient. There's plenty of seating, and even a giant TV where folks can watch sports. They've got a few beers, and if you feel like being cheap the aluminum pints of Coors Light are $2. I don't know how many you can order before they give you concerned looks. =)   Anyway, I ordered the So Gouda, with thinly-shaved steak, onions, and gouda. It was just OK. The bread didn't seem like anything special, and it was toasted in a manner that made it incredibly crunchy and crumbly. I really enjoyed the chips that came with it, and the price overall was good, so I won't complain.   If you're on the light rail and totally starving, I'd say look for this. If you want a really good sandwich, keep on going.",

I am glad we stumbled upon this place while visiting Phoenix. It was conveniently located close to our hotel, so we just walked right on over.  There are tons of sandwiches to choose from including vegan options (I'm not vegan, but I have a few vegan friends... And it's always hard to find restaurants that allow for us all to eat what we want). I ended up getting the JP Grilled Cheese. The cashier suggested I swap out steak for the jalapenos, but I went ahead and kept it how it was on the menu. We also ordered mimosas because they were decently priced, and they only had sweet wine.  The sandwich was greatness. Cheesy, spicy goodness. It has white cheddar and cream cheese on it. The cream cheese made it hard to keep the sandwich together as the two pieces of bread kept sliding around. Still, the flavor was very good. I think it might have even been better if I would have substituted meat for the jalapenos. My only major complaint is the bread kind of hurt the roof of my mouth because it was so toasty, but it was worth it. The mimosas were also very good and a nice size.   Overall, the restaurant was nice, clean, and the food was delightful. I'll definitely check one out closer to home.",

    "text": "So my group of friends are doing a 24 hour Questival adventure race and one of the \"challenges\" was to eat at Even Stevens. I wouldn't really consider it a challenge though because we were hungry and couldn't wait to get here after the opening festival!   My friends all got different sandwiches, which they loved but I ordered a chicken, berry and oats salad. It's very unlike me to order a salad but for some reason, I was craving something good but easy to eat. I'll admit. This was the first time I've eaten a salad with granola oats in it. It was made of homemade granola oats so the good type of chunky and flavorful.  With the blueberries and the feta cheese, it was a really refreshing salad! The chicken seemed like it was roasted and thinly sliced. The large salad was very filling even though it was just a salad.  The environment was warm and inviting. Tables resided both indoors and outdoors. The patio wasn't too large but gave just enough space for people to enjoy the outdoors especially during the nicer weather now. On the other side, there was a brightly colored turquoise couch with colorful pillows and a coffee table facing two large grey swivel chairs. Our group gravitated towards this couch! The coffee table had books about the history of Arizona and Phoenix with a lot of photographs.   The best part about Even Stevens is they donate sandwiches to non profits!! I can't say there are many sandwich shops out there that exist for a cause other than just food alone! I'm glad I finally got a chance to try Even Stevens and can't wait to go back to actually have sandwiches and not just a salad!",

    "text": "This place is a really good sandwich spot! I have been here several times and I have some tips for potential customers. 1. The tater tots are horrible. I ordered online for pick-up and the tots tasted old and hard. I called the manager and he was so AWESOME! He apologized and made me a whole new order. Sadly, they were hot this time, but still tasted the same. I'm not sure how they cook the tots, but they might want to cook or buy a different brand of tots because I'm telling you, they are the worst tots I have ever had. 2. Don't order online. I ordered online and my tots and mac n cheese were very cold when I picked it up. I was 10 minutes early from the time they quoted my food to be ready and the food was already bagged.  I have been here where I have ordered to go in person and the freshness of the food is night and day. 3. Do get the Turkey Day! It's my favorite sandwich so far.",

Today i ordered for pickup for the second time and was left, once again, thoroughly disappointed.  The first time I ordered, my sandwich was completely deconstructed and they didn't include my side order.  This time, I ordered the chopped salad and added chicken for an additional $2.  Guess what? No freaking chicken on my salad.  Also, this is THE WORST chopped salad I have ever had - ice berg lettuce, hardly chopped at all, a few tomatoes, a smattering of sliced grape tomatoes and a sprinkle of blue cheese with a few chunks of pork belly; for the $10 I spent, I could've made myself a better salad with ingredients from the CVS down the street.  Way to let me down once again, Even Stevens.  I will never patron your store again and I will never recommend anyone eat there.",

I can concur with other reviews on the issue of the atmosphere being a little too hipster/millenial, which just feels unprofessional at times but they are nice and helpful. They do have other issues they need to get worked out 1) everytime I go there it is freezing in there, 2) more often than not the coke freestyle machine is on the fritz, 3) yes, I agree that their chips seem like Lay's, which is pretty unoriginal, and 4) why am i asked to give a tip when i pay for the food when no one has served me yet? Tips are based on quality of service and not necessarily obligatory. The sandwiches, though. So, so good. Food generally comes out fast too. I will keep coming if they can grow into something better, but if they stagnate, I'll probably go somewhere else.",

The Hummus and avocado were spread thin. Considering I walked out of my way to check this spot out, I was hoping for a stacked sandwich. The salad was a delicious choice with a house vinaigrette.

Very bustling atmosphere, patrons mostly white collars on lunch and convention goers.   Food: Menu has your typical artisan inspired sandwiches and salads that include micro greens, artisan cheeses and other fine touches. The turkey melt had Havarti cheese and cranberries, which I thought was a nice combo. The goat hugger salad also was delicious with generous portions of feta and beets.  Service: Food delivered promptly and with a smile. They hire from disadvantaged populations which adds to the feel good vibe not mention they donate heavily to local non-profits  Price: On the high end but par for course in the artisan cafe world.  Overall: A great option for lunch when you're downtown that includes the feel-good factor that your contributing to a worthwhile social venture. Also check out Helpings if you're into cafes that donate back to the community.",

    "text": "So, I've been hearing a lot about this placed called Even Steven's that had opened recently in downtown. So I thought I'd give it a try after taking a look at their menu. Clever and funny it is at the same time. So after finding a parking space, I make my way to the sandwich shop.  My first impression of the joint was to immediately turn around and walk out. The place oozed millennial / hipster / Scottsdale-Bro mentality, pretty much everything I despise about the people running around off their meds in today's world... But then again, I am posting this with a smartphone, so yes I see the irony...   Moving on... I make my way to the counter and was greeted promptly. Plus. I told the hostess that I'd like to place a carryout order for two Do Gouda sandwiches, one without the red onions with the marmalade on the side. No potato salad? Fail. So plain photo chips that I'm pretty sure were Lays was what we got.  Fast forward nearly twenty minutes, my take out order is ready. Twenty min for two sandwiches when I'm the only one in the store? Did you have to go out back and round up the cow, and smoke the gouda while I waited really? Fail. Both orders went into two separate bags... okay whatever.  Meet up with the other person who wanted the sandwich, the one who wanted hers without the red onions and the marmalade on the side, well, sure enough, onions were on the sandwich as was the marmalade after the bag was clearly written on saying otherwise. Fail. And these people want $15 an hour, really???  Okay fine, whatever, I'm hungry and I dig into my sandwich. Now, I will say, these guys do make a mean roast beef and gouda. Damn good really. Plus. Aside from the boring Lays photo chips, the sandwich was absolutely awesome.  The greatness of the food greatly offsets the millennial / hipster dirty feeling one gets from walking into this place I will say that. I'm not sure I will return to the downtown location for this reason, and well, parking is a hassle, but I will have to go check out one of their other valley locations.",

The Pot Roast sandwich is the greatest creation ever! The Pot Roast is juicy and delicious, topped with a jalapeno jam and a nice, crunchy bun! The sandwich blends all those ingredients so beautifully and they play so well of one another perfectly! It's the greatest sandwich I have ever eaten! The baked Mac and Cheese is creamy and loaded with bacon! The staff is super friendly and so much fun to talk to! Plus, every purchase goes to a great cause! I will definitely be back! They are the #1 sandwich place in the valley! So happy that they are here! Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Visiting from CA. So excited to try this place since the reviews were so positive and the Even Stevens nostalgia in the name was kinda cute, but not too much good to say. The hostess(?)/server seemed bored and despondent and put out to hand us paper menus - and didn't seem to really want to explain how the place worked. My BF asked if the weather was unusual (it was raining and we are from Ca) and she literally looked at him with a blank stare and said \"I don't know\". Did she just arrive from somewhere else into Phoenix and this was Day 1 on the job?   Ordered our food and found a seat with our number and when the food came she brought no silverware - which was not located at the help yourself counter so had to find her again and ask for some. The burritos had so much cheese (and trust you me, I love cheese) that they were inedible and there was so much grease that the tortilla was soggy. We ate less than 1/2 each and just left.  TBH, the vibe seemed very sort of hipster, proud of themselves and more concerned with being cool than actually taking care of the people spending money - great that they give in the community but that money should come from giving everyone spending their money a positive experience.   Too bad, the inside is cute and has potential - hopefully they take care of others better than they took care of us.  **Update 5/4/17: the person who commented below reached out to me for my email to make amends, but never emailed. I messaged her a month later to follow up, still no response to date. Seems on par with the initial visit - all hat, no cowboy.",

We were greeted with a  warm, welcoming smile and  told to sit wherever we want. The sandwiches we wonderful and perfectly toasted. The saucy tots were nice and crispy with 3 very good sauces. The \"baked\" mac and cheese wasn't really \"baked\" (a little runny for our taste) but still good! (My husband still ate every bite!) All in all, I highly recommend it! And we will be back! Maybe next time I'll bring a book and hang out a while! (Oh! And they give back to the community! Another great reason to come here!)",

It goes to a good cause because they donate food each time you order a sandwich.  Moving on the the meal itself, I had a mimosa and a Mahami Vice, which is a Cubano.   Cubano includes ham, beef, pickles, and mustard, comes with either chips or a mixed green salad.  Other than being a little bit dry, the sandwich was a large portion and was a great breakfast!   It's a really laid back joint, the service is good, and they have study and small casual meeting spaces available.  If you're looking for a good sandwich with a good cause this is the place.",
