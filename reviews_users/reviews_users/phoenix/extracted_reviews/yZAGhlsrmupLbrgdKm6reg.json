Everyone deserves to have an off day with service and this was their night. What I did find not acceptable was when I showed my server a simple $10 coupon I received from them 2 days ago, I was told by her and the manager that I wasn't able to use it tonight because they couldn't properly scan it into the system and that I could use it another night. Good idea for them. Sure makes sense. For me, won't be back as I feel that this was totally dishonest. Mind you that the bill was well over $200 so the measly $10 is not the issue but truly just the point. Not acceptable. They should be ashamed. No interest in going back. BTW Don, my family had been eating your ribs since you were in Chicago. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.",

Great potential, but seriously needs some tall tree dividers from noisy Camelback Road!  Never ceases to amaze me how restaurant owners  build a patio next to a parking lot or busy street and fail to add landscaping!  Seriously, plant some queen palms or a row of ornamental orange trees.  We moved to a table inside.   Food and ambience always great, but do agree with others that much touted ribs are lacking in real meat quantity.  Wait staff is always pleasant and professional.  I just want to have dinner on a beautifully landscaped patio!",

    "text": "Don & Charlies 7501 E Camelback Rd Scottsdale, AZ 85251  This is an old restaurant to Phoenix people that has survived simply because it's good. You don't stay in business for more than 20 years unless your doing something right.  The restaurant is decorated with tons of sport memorabilia; signed baseball bats and balls all over the place. I'm not sure that one would say that the restaurant has a lot of ambiance, and it's not the place to go for a romantic dinner, but it is interesting. Reservations are a must here.  Our wait for our table with reservations was about 10 minutes, which was spent in the comfortable bar. In fairness, the place was packed with people.  We were seated at our table, and were promptly served complimentary chopped liver, onions, chopped egg, and a basket of wonderful bread. I could have made a meal just out of this.  Companion and I both had the house salad ($2.50) to start and shared the Baked Spinach and Artichoke dip ($7.95). The salad was crisp and not watery, and the dip had good flavor and was nicely done. I ordered the House Anchovy dressing and companion had the Creamy Garlic. Both dressings were better than ordinary.  Next came the main course. The menu covers a lot of territory, ranging from chicken to fish to shrimp, and of course, meats. They like to trumpet their ribs, and they are very good, but I come here for the beef. They have the cooking of steaks down to a science, and they always are served exactly as you order it. Their Rib Steak ($30.95) and Bone-In Rib Steak ($44.95 - 22 oz) are always winners as is their Prime Rib ($25.95 - $31.95).  This evening I ordered the Skirt Steak. This particular cut of meat is extremely flavorful and when cooked right beautifully tender. The steak comes with burnt onions, but I ordered mine with sauteed onions instead. I prefer the taste of the sweet caramelized onions as opposed to the burnt ones. I ordered a baked potato with mine and companion and I shared a dish of Creamed Spinach. My steak came exactly as I ordered it, and was hanging over the sides of the plate it was so big. It was tender and juicy.  Companion ordered the Prime Rib large cut. Though companion could not possibly finish the large cut, the extra that was taken home made fine sandwiches the next day! The Prime Rib arrived medium rare with both horseradish sauce and au jus to go with it. Companion also ordered Sauteed Mushrooms ($4.95) which were pronounced excellent.  Neither of us had room for desert after this meal.   Interestingly, they have a gluten free menu which is a bit unusual to find these days.  Sanitation was as it should be for a restaurant of this caliber, and it is nicely handicapped available.  I give Don & Charlies 4 stars for quality of food and cleanliness.",

    "text": "I can't believe the great reviews this place gets. I think its reputation among people who actually care about good food was summed up by two separate concierges at our 5-star hotel when I told them we hadn't liked Don & Charlies: \"WHO SENT YOU to Don & Charlies????\" Its listing as a \"steakhouse\" and reviews referring to it as \"steakhouse\" or \"chop house\" leads you to believe this is going to be of a Flemings or Ruths Chris caliber, but it's absolutely nothing like that. Not. Even. Close.  I was with friends who are not foodies and don't go out nearly as much as I do, and even they were completely baffled why anyone would recommend it. I guess if you like (love) baseball you might enjoy going in just for the museum aspect. They certainly have a lot of balls (heh) and photos from the 70s. Nothing, including the cooking techniques, has been updated since then.  We had reservations and were seated promptly in the dining room -- two tables away from a large party celebrating the birthdays of a couple of small children. We immediately asked to be moved and were quickly and graciously relocated to the bar. This was fine with us, and actually was a bonus for one of our party since she had a burger from the bar menu which was the only edible meal.  I ordered a pomegranate margarita which was undrinkable -- too syrupy and sweet. Others had the prickly pear margarita and they said that drink was ok.  First out was the chopped liver which none of wanted so we sent it back. We had a spinach dip appetizer which was ok. I had a caesar salad, nothing special, the rest had the vinegar cole slaw which was deemed by all to be good but nothing special.  Then came the entrees. The gal who had the burger was the only happy one, but the \"onion strings\" that came with it were a joke. Gloppy strings of over-fried dough that looked to have sat out for awhile before being served. Four people had the famous ribs and proclaimed them to be dry, meatless, and impossible to eat. I had the filet trio with three different \"crusts.\" The little blobs of meat were dry and flavorless, and the \"crusts\" were just dabs of some kind of mixture that added nothing to the meat. The only one I got any flavor from was the dijon mustard one, and that was kind of overwhelming. The twice-baked potatoes were huge, but so dry and tasteless.  This is the kind of food that was considered gourmet back in the 60s I suppose, but they seriously need to update things. I've been to throwback type places that at least serve good food. The concierge told me, politely, that they would only send their \"over 60\" clientele there, and then she said, \"But I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I don't like it AT ALL.\"  This is a place you can definitely afford to miss.",

It was by far the star of the show.  The sides were not bad, but were merely unremarkable. The creamy coleslaw was just bland, the salad was forgettable, the fried onion strings were certainly decent but not the best I've had.  The service was stellar, and a couple of times \"manager-looking\" people strode by and asked me how everything was going.  Servers who were not even mine spoke to me in a friendly manner.  Nice experience. Go check it out.",

The good news was that we had time to look at the memorabilia in the entry way without huge crowds to maneuver around.  So much fun stuff to see.   Our waitress and the rest of the staff were very helpful.  No one was pushy.  My wife and I split an entree and they were very good about splitting the potato on 2 plates. Plenty of food for us.  (we took home leftovers).  This meal we had the ribs.  As always, the food was good old American food.  Not too special, but tasty and filling. Drinks and wine are about normal for Scottsdale.

Great recommendation from a good friend from Mayo Scottsdale. Great sporting decor, warm ambience. Came again with kids (2 two year olds, an eleven year old and one thirteen year old) and a few adults.  Ribs, chicken, fish (Mahi mahi), potatoes, fries, broccoli all made with care with quality ingredients and quite tasty. A little expensive but I think it was worth it given the quality of food and the excellent service. Even the childs portions were a good value given the portions. I ordered prime ribs which isn't on the menu but is indeed the prime ribs after the steak portion has been cut off. You have to get there early to get this and only by request since again, it isn't on the menu. Cool.",

She validated our first time at Don & Charlies, and gave a brief overview of the restaurant and its history.  When we were called to our table, we had a young man named Jeff as our server.  He provided us with good tips on our interested appetite selections. I had the prime rib which was excellent tasting and very tender along with cole slaw.

A man whose job it is to go around and say hello to diners, thank them for coming, and ask if there's anything he can do to make the meal even better.  A waitress who not only brings you your coke, but puts a lemon in the side and fills a carafe with more in case you want seconds. How about manners?  It even rubs off on the busboys who ask politely if they can clear your dishes and who refill your water without you even having to ask.  My wife and I thought we died and went to restaurant heaven.  Or is this the way it was in the 70's but we have all become so attached to our cell phones that we didn't notice that no one gives a sh_t anymore?  I had the cheapest thing on the menu.  Pulled chicken BBQ sandwich with onion rings.  I was full after three bites but I had to finish.  It was best I ever had.  Cole slaw on the side...a kind of cole slaw I haven't had in decades.  Awesome!  The wife had BBQ chicken dinner ($20).  So much food she will have two lunches from the leftover. Mmmmmm.  She said it was really, really good.  We also had a side of broccoli which was served with some kind of dressing on the side to dip it in.  Wow!  That was soooo good.  The baked potato that came with my wife's meal was HUGE....forget about that Wendy's potato you/ve grown accustomed to...this is a real potato.  Crazy good.  Mine came with French fries - there were so many fries they were literally falling off the plate.  This place gets 5 stars.  No doubt.  I loved it and I'll totally be back.

We shared it all- Caesar, wedge, ribs, prime rib, rib eye, au gratin, baked, and twice baked  The rub on the rib eye was killer- it competes and outpaces the big steak houses around town.   Martinis were top notch and service was just right.   Turtle pie for dessert pushed us all over the edge- doesn't look like much but it's dense and packs a good punch- full of flavor and the perfect finish.",

They were very accomodating by putting us in the back room which allowed to enjoy ourselves freely with out disturbing other patrons. The staff right off the bat was amazing one of our servers had been there since the beginning and she was a blast to have as well as the other server. They both put up with our antics and played along with the mood. The food was delish. I shared the liver and wow! Yummy. Not a liver guy but this was good.  Most everyone had the steaks and were all raving about the cuts and flavor. All in all had a great time there as did our entire group. The memorabilia was a great added addition to as every piece could strike up a conversation.  Cant wait to go back again!",

It's where my sister and I decided to have our Grad party and were met with zero hesitation from my parents.  I love this place the atmosphere is fantastic with all the sports collectibles, it doesn't happen to be terribly loud for dinner unlike a lot of places. Let's not forget they start you out with some of the best chopped liver I have ever had.  My favorite here is the prime rib as it is always perfectly cooked and seasoned and nice and juicy. I am also a big fan of the cesar salad here, for some reason it is better than most.  Oh and found out the steak sandwich is really a medium steak served with 2 pieces of bread on the side. My buddy ordered it at my grad party and we both expected some slices of steak between some bread. What he got was a full steak and 2 pieces of garlic break.   I have no idea what made me post the last review and not throw out the one random night they were a bit off on a busy holiday. This is on of my favorites in the valley and my first choice when I want a steak. Been here tons of times and hope to go back tons more.",

He also treats his employees extremely well. I have nothing bad to say about D n C. The food is awesome which is how I ended up getting a job there because my family all loved the food so much and took me there a few times before I started working there. The service we received was always great before I worked there and for the most part I loved my co workers. I wish I could move D n C's over to San Diego!   If you want a great meal order the prime rib, the filet topped w blue cheese or parm cheese, or get the famous baby back ribs (charred dons way), also the Seattle style salmon is KILLER order the twice baked pot or the au gratins. Our expresso martini and the peach cosmo were to die for.   If you want a funny server ask for Hershey he's the best and will have the table laughing hysterically. If you want an experienced server ask for Patrick or Mary they are both very attentive. If you want an overall good server who has it all ask for Jennifer or Sam.  Austin the manager is awesome, Don is impressive, and the food is great period.  As far as the liver goes people get so mad that its not free anymore, but think of this...what other restaurant just gives you free stuff besides bread?! In my eyes it was a smart move. I will continue going back to D n C's to eat every time I am in town.  D n C I will miss you and maybe will see ya next spring training season :)",

We loved it so much this year we are going back for my husband's birthday tonight and I can't wait!  I don't understand some of the negative reviews as we have never had a bad experience.  We eat at a lot of fine dining restaurants and this place has a charm all its own, that you don't find in new restaurants. It is an older restaurant that has been around a long time, but I love the 'old' Chicago style feel of the place, and the way the food is served. Cole slaw (creamy!) out first is part of that charm, and the way they prepare their ribs as well.  Service has always been impeccable with friendly, attentive staff.  All the potato dishes are excellent!  We usually all get baby back ribs but occasionally we order fish, steak, prime rib, all of which never disappoint.    The only disappointment we found during our last visit was that the liver dish that was usually brought out complimentary is now a charged item.  This happens from time to time with a lot of restaurants we visit so I can understand.  Other than that, this place is excellent.",

I got the French Onion Soup, its actually better at Mimi's.  They put way too much cheese, the bread is pathetic and there's hardly any onions in it.  The prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter.  Never heard of that before either.  Luckily I had some sour cream with my baked potato and I asked for some raw horseradish so I can concoct my own.  Wasn't the best, but way better than the butter!    The barbeque chicken was ok.  I've had better at diners.  They didn't really season the bird, just threw some barbeque sauce on it.  At least it wasn't terribly dry...  I don't think I'm coming back to this one.  Nooooo..",

Not only was every inch decked in awesome old sports memorabilia, but the environment and food were over the top amazing! What a relief to enjoy a mom&pop type of restaurant packed to the gills on a Thursday night. I got the more classic Cobb salad with salmon and it was the best salad I ever had... My fiance who is a meat snob (cough cough) ordered pork chops and he was more than pleased. We were also very impressed by their home made apple sauce. This is the only place I've ever been that has gotten me excited enough to write a Yelp review of my own. We will return and we will highly recommend to all. Our two dishes were $55 together, which is just barely pricier than normal for a casual night out, but it was certainly worthy of it. Thanks for a great meal!",

I unfortunately was stupid enough to begin a very strict diet before using my groupon but decide to struggle through a meal with out being able to splurge on everything that would tempt me. My boyfriend and I went (we go out to eat way too often but seem to overlook the classic spots like D&C's and always seem to go to the 'new' places ) . I did survive my meal. And as bland of a diet I had to stick to, I still had a good meal. My boyfriend LOVED everything he had. The owner Don brought him out some cheesy bread appetizer that he raved about (that I was not allowed to taste LOL). I was able to eat the shrimp cocktail with horseradish. Yummy cocktail sauce. Very good side salad (yes...I know...boring to the rest of you but you have no idea how scrumptious good lettuce can be when thats pretty much all your are allowed to eat!)  More importantly, I had no problem getting a reservation once I planned accordingly (considering my days off are Sunday/Monday and I work late most nights) I really wish I could remember our waiters name. He was attentive, helpful, accommodating and friendly. I had explained to him my ridiculous diet restrictions and he kept coming back to make sure everything was working out ok. And yes he knew we had a Groupon.  I cant wait to be able to order anything I want on the menu and will go back.  Furthermore, as a local business manager who has run Groupons, I am aware of the mad rush especially toward the expiration, and what clients expect and what the businesses sacrifice when running a groupon. I thankfully was not treated like a \"groupon customer\" and am sorry for the poor reviews. I too called for a reservation at some point and heard the recording they would be closed Mondays. Never once did I get from the recording they were closed for the summer.",

The waiters and waitresses are professional, the baked mac and cheese is out of this world...as is the cole slaw (either way you get it).  If you're considering going...don't hesitate or else you'll regret it!",

I personally prefer the baby back ribs while some of my friends preferred the charred version. Don't forget about the sides either! I think the best way to experience Don and Charlie's is to go with a group so that you can literally order everything on the menu.   Our server that night was Hershey and he is awesome! I think he's moving to California which is too bad for Don and Charlie's. He was one of the best servers I've ever had - friendly, attentive, fabulous!",

I also love the atmosphere of this place, with all the sport decorations on the wall, which is very different from any restaurants we've been to. I would recommend  this place to anyone who loves steak/BBQ!!",

    "text": "Was excited to try this place since I saw from their website that it had tons of sports memorobilia, and that the owner was from Chicago (where we are from).  And, it was within walking distance too.  Walked over there for dinner - it was, of course, ridiculously crowded.  Problem #1 - the hostess was completely clueless and overwhelmed.  We asked how long the wait would be, she said she was unsure.  We asked if we could put our name in, she again said she didn't know.  In the meantime, they're calling other parties names for seating, so we ask again.  The hostess gets a confused look on her face and ignores us.  So.... we just sat ourselves in the bar dining area.   Fifteen minutes later, a server decides to come over and ask us if we'd been helped.  She takes our drink order.  Two other servers come by and ask if we would like to order drinks, and we tell them we'd already had our drink order taken.  Throughout the course of our meal, I think four servers served us.  No clue who our actual server was.    I think this was in part because there was an ASU sports group (head coach?) in the restaurant sitting a few tables over.  It was amusing to watch the cheeseball of an owner spend the whole evening name-dropping and schmoozing with them.  Too bad it was at the expense of the other customers.    The food we ordered was actually good.  Kind of surprised that the burgers didn't come with fries, especially for over $10.  After we were done eating, it literally took almost a half hour for us to get our bill.  One of our four servers actually caught on and brought a bill and apologized for the sketchy service, but assumed we understood since the table behind us was \"more important.  It is the new ASU head coach, you know.\"    We admired the memorobila collection as we walked out, listened to the owner do some more name-dropping about how he knew Bud Selig in the lobby, and left.  Despite the good food and impressive sports collection, we probably won't be back.  Too bad - was hoping for better.",

Things I like: + The Creme Brulee- quite possibly the best in the Valley. + Their seafood appetizers (Shrimp Cocktail, Calamari, etc)- delicious. + The Wedge Salad with their creamy garlic dressing- amazing! + The service- outstanding; took care of every need/concern. Top notch.  Things that are not so great: (-) The steaks- they're decent, but not phenomenal. I've got other go-to places for a Filet Mignon or Prime Rib, but it definitely won't be here again. (-) The tables- they really pack people into this place. Feels like everyone is at one big table, so close you wouldn't have to strain to get into other table's conversations...in fact, you have to strain NOT to get into other table's conversations.  Overall, I'll be back, but not for a steak...and never on a weekend. I'd like to try their burgers. And I'll certainly be having that wedge salad and creme brulee again.",

We did not take him up on the offer (though gracious), but called one month in advance for our party of 6. We were seated immediately at a nice round table and our server was lovely.  The food was fine- not exceptional but good.  The prime rib in particular was stellar.  My complaint and reason for the 3 stars was my nemesis-- this large white vent that blew 60 degree air conditioning directly into our table 6 feet away.  There was an empty table next to us which they could have moved us to (and sat empty well into our meal). Instead l, I spent 90 minutes with air blasting into my face and food every 10 minutes for 3-4 minutes. For such a nice successful restaurant, you would think  they could do better. This is Scottsdale.  How about some central air people?!",

I ordered the trout and it was moist on the inside with a nice coating on the outside. My husband said he never enjoyed a rib eye steak that was prepared so well and juicy with so much flavor as theirs.   One of my son's enjoyed their prime rib and ate his entire plate. My other son had the ribs and said it was good and was glad he got to take that home to his dorm for left overs.   We also got to try the liver Pate, and spinach dip.   There is a set menu for hearty eaters. We had 4 on our table that came with a choice of appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert for $44.00.   A strong Yay to recommend Don & Charlie's for Dining.",

When he handed me the $4, I gave him 2$ (more than 20%) and he said NOTHING. No thanks. No, here is your change. Nothing.   What a dbag.   A 'tip' is on service and this guy gave none.

There are autographed baseballs, basketballs, footballs, bats, helmets, photos, cards, etc. This place could rival any collection of sports memorabilia in the country. I am a huge collector and one time the manager pulled me in the office to see a few items that were purchased which was the official lineup cards for all 7 games of the 2001 World Series.   As for the food, great prime rib and baby back ribs. The calamari is top notch as is the potatoes au gratin.  3 different size prime rib cuts and ask for it to be medium rare or it will be a little dry plus they will supply as much au jus as you need. Tip of the day, if you have a young one order the kids meal prime rib because it is a generous cut at a portion of the adult size.   The ribs are also a staple here where I would suggest if you come here with a guest split the prime rib and full rack of ribs.  The restaurant has been a part of Restaurant Week and is a decent deal.  Love this restaurant and will come back to celebrate another occasion.",

My mom likes the big tender coconut shrimp. I also recommend trying the coleslaw as 50/50 which is half creamy style and half deli style perfect when mixed together.

The additional char on the steaks is worth it, and makes a definite difference as my dad had his prepared this way and I did not.

    "text": "Don and Charlies, a Scottsdale gem that has been serving up midwestern (ala Chicago) food that hits mostly on all cylinders. While the food was THE standout star, the service and ambiance prevent it from earning a 5 star mark. Here's why:  Service: We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner. However, despite having reservations they proceeded to make us wait 5-10min. Fine, we can look at all the baseballs.. did I mention they had a babe ruth signed one? The waitress was nice and even brought us some free cheesy bread. She made us feel like we were regulars, even though it was our first time dining there. The only downside, she was absent for a good chunk of the meal, only popping up here and there to deliver condiments and other things (granted their busy, but you should take extra special care of a first time diner) and can someone fill up my water glass?? You get thirsty eating bagel chips!  Food: Wife and I had the Prime Rib, which were excellent in terms of quality and price. The Prime Rib was Prime Grade beef and it showed. Now, I've eaten at some of the best Prime Rib Spots here in the valley (Durants/Stockyards come to mind) and in Las Vegas, but this place is now up there. Not Lawry's/House of Prime Rib good, but no one in AZ is in their league. They said they had the best Prime Rib in town, one would have to agree...   Salad: Deli style coleslaw. Vinegar and Sweet. Bring more now.   Bread: Warm and soft. Especially the comped cheesy bread. That stuff I could eat all day.   Dessert: Banana Cream Pie, ehh... I've had better.. Come to think.. You want good banana cream pie? Head to Emeril's Delmonico..  Atmosphere: Nothing fancy, but clean and orderly. Nice baseball memorabilia on the wall. Only one problem. Its soooooo loud. Not obnoxious (well, except this one girl who sang happy birthday out-loud.. to the whole restaurant.. and she was a patron), but I had speak a tone that is not conducive to a trying to eat and digest a full pound of Prime Rib. Can they have less tables and charge like 5-10 more per entree? That would solve that. Or maybe we should go at like 7:30pm when all those grey hair had left....",

It's not a cheap place, but you are paying for central Scottsdale and walls of memorabilia. Lots of COOL Sports Memorabilia. As for the food, it was good. Nothing stunning, but good average food. Since they are \"FAMOUS\" for their ribs, I had to have them. They came sauce on and it's a good sauce. The Southwestern Sauce is the best, since it's spicier. I would prefer sauce off, with the nice char they had on them. The flavor was very good, though even having them sauced didn't compensate enough for the dry meat. Just a tiny bit over done, but still one of the better tasting ribs I've had in a new place for me. I'd say maybe the 5th best ribs I've eaten in the valley. They should vacuum seal them after smoking to keep them moist till they put them on the grill for a nice char. They do cost about $8 more than I think they are worth for a full rack. Their slaw and baked potato are top notch. Loved the potato. The best I've had in years with a wonderful herb crust. As for the other dishes at the table, The Salmon was happily enjoyed along with a big steak. The Cobb salad next to me looked fantastic. So were the deserts enjoyed by other people. I'm glad I was full. It's a neat place for a once a year meal, but not the type of place I'd eat at regularly since the food isn't much different than most similar chain restaurants.",

The Caesar salad had a little too much dressing on it so next time will ask for a little lighter but nothing near drowning in dressing worthy of being sent back.  The atmosphere is really comfortable and not like a stuffy steakhouse I have seen at other higher end locations.  Lots of cool sports memorabilia on the walls.

I had broasted chicken for the first time which was great.  I added a wedge salad which might have been overpriced. My wife had salmon which seemed high for $24 but adding au gratin potatoes added $4. My well vodka martini at $12.50 plus a couple of glasses of Sauvignon Blanc added another $30.   I am not sure what things should cost these days. Adding tax and a fair tip then paying and tipping the valet brought this to $119 for a simple dinner for two. Service was great. Neighboring tables were loud and obnoxious.",

    "text": "Never thought I would be writing this one especially after going here for twenty years. Getting a bad meal does happen but all four of us at the same time. What has happened to this place???. The server was not very good to say the least. Didn't seem to understand different meat temps(i think she was a vegetarian). Filet ordered med rare came out med, prime rib ordered med rare came or med I asked if they had any VERY rare prime rib before ordering, was told I can order it for you, asked if she could check to see if they had any VERY rare before ordering as I know very well that they run out if it early, and would order something else if they were out,  she insisted she could \"order it rare\" I repeated very rare and she insisted she could deliver, sure enough it came out med, not even rare, looked identical to the other one we had ordered med rare that was med. She said she would get me another, again I said if you don't have any VERY rare I will order something else. She brought me out another aside from being a very poor cut it was med rare. She was getting closer but still not rare let alone VERY rare. I asked if she knew what VERY rare was., she said would you like it \"black and blue\" seriously, prime rib prepared black and blue!! I said forget it I'll have the NY strip cooked VERY rare. She asked if I wanted it black and blue, I said no, but VERY rare. When it finally came out it was rare, still not VERY rare. But at least it was rare and it was a dry steak, not very juicy as was the filet one of us had that was also overcooked.  Overall the quality of the food served  was well below what I had come to expect after 20+ years of frequenting the place. When the waitress brought out the check she made a point of saying she took the prime rib that I sent back( because it was overcooked & she was to either stubborn or ignorant to see if they had any VERY rare) off the check(like she was doing me a favor) and replaced it with the NY strip that I ordered for an additional $8.   There were more issues with the service but enough said, just a very poor experience at what WAS my favorite place in Scottsdale to get a great steak and always recommended it for the food not just the memorabilia. I guess that's all changed now.",

We came with friends, and would probably not come alone, as it does get loud with crowded tables....definitely would not bring kids.  Some yelpers have said that when they arrive, even with a ressie, they have to wait. We must have been lucky....we were seated immediately for our Saturday night 6:45 ressie. I'm not sure you could get into this place with out one. Oh! And they have valet parking for $7.00( a bit steep)...but there wasn't a spot to be found.  I was very impressed with the food quality...as we started off with a huge plate of onion skins, courtesy of yelp. At the table they give you sliced bagel crisps and rye bread.  I ordered the prime rib 12 oz medium rare with a side Caesar salad, mayo cole slaw,  and baked potato. Unfortunately they ran out of baked potatoes so I got potatoes au gratin. My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I see why everyone loves the coleslaw....one of our guests said that he hadn't eaten a steak this good in a very long time.  Don and Charlie's isn't for everyone, it's not trendy or gourmet....it's just solid good steaks and ribs, older crowd atmosphere, with excellent service you should expect from a great restaurant.",

    "text": "We went here last Friday night 1/10/14.   Had a reservation for 4 people at 8pm. Got there a few minutes early, ordered a drink in the bar.  A few minutes later our name was called. The place was packed, that is a testament to their customer following as the dining room is rather large.    It was our first time here.   I loved the complimentary crunchy, thin toasted bagels and rye bread.    We Ordered the artichoke dip (free for checking in with YELP) and It was good.    I had the 8oz charred filet, it was really good! I ate the whole thing!  It was served with a salad and a ginormous twice baked potato! I couldn't eat half of it, but it reheats very well wrapped in tin foil in the toaster oven. FYI.   Ryan ordered prime rib, Peggy and Haynes both ordered ribs with cold slaw.   We all enjoyed our dinner very much.   Good selection of wine and cocktails as well.   Very old school supper club kinda vibe mixed in with all that sports memorabilia.   We will definitely go back.  The management and waitstaff were very attentive and personable.   The ONLY gripe I have is that I wish people weren't dressed so casual.  We were all dressed up as it was Friday night and this isn't an inexpensive restaurant.   I felt sorta overdressed compared to the other customers, but not for the restaurant, if that makes sense.   I am guessing they have many local regulars who feel comfortable going \" up the road\" in their uggs and sweats or jeans and sweatshirts  for a nice steak.   But that complaint really has nothing to do with the restaurant and my dining experience.  I guess I feel the need to bring it up because it took me by surprise how some of the customers were so under dressed. More like a \"Chilis and dollar movie night\" rather than a $300 meal in a nice steakhouse kinda night. But anywho......   We really enjoyed the food, the waitstaff and management and we will be back..  Oh!! The creme brulee was wonderful! Banana cream pie was really good. The chocolate cake, huge and pretty good.   We will be back..  Excuse my choppy sentence review. But you get the drift. :)",

Our server (a former owner of a Greek restaurant, as he mentioned) was very attentive and during the meal's only misstep--when a friend's steak came out medium rare, and he was hoping for it to be rare--our server and management were very accommodating in bringing out a corrected portion.  Calamari and the cheese bread were great; we got a $70 bottle of wine which was excellent, and my steak (8 oz. filet) was succulent and perfectly cooked at medium rare.  Desserts were fine; the cheesecake was the star of the three that we had (cheesecake, chocolate cake, key lime pie).  I have had better servings of everything elsewhere, but all of the chow was solid.  My only knock is the space; while I'm sure it's fine for some, the low ceilings, tight restroom, and small tables (our table for six is a four-top in most cities I visit) make it much less than ideal for someone 6'1\"...and worse for someone who's 6'7\", like one of the guys I went with.  All of this is to say that if you are a meat-eater under 5'10\", you are all good!",

Your head will be on a swivel looking around at it all.  I'd say the place is casual, even though they say proper attire required.    Food-I ordered the signature ribs...and sorry to say..but I don't get it.  They say up front it's not meat falling off the bone type of ribs but I figured I'd give them a shot anyway since they hype it up so much...and say they've won awards..but I don't get it.  I barely got 1 bite per rib and had to really get after it to get any meat.  Uh, not award winning in my opinion so...I'd say order something else if you go here.    Service-A lot of retirees go there right at like 5:30-6 and they have blue plate specials and it got packed quick so service was a bit slow but understandable when you have that kind of a rush.    Overall-So if you want to grab a beer and enjoy the memorabilia and possibly see a famous baseball player during Spring Training I'd definitely check this place out.  I'll give it another shot with some of their other food selections next time but overall this place is legendary but the food in my opinion is average.",

I'll try & keep this review short & to the point. At first I was a little overwhelmed by all the people waiting to be seated, but then seeing how every inch of the place was filled with absolutely amazing sports memorabilia, you become lost in the greatness. That was just the first good part of the night. The best & most important part was CHARLIE (sorry if I misspelled your name ). When I tell you she gave the ABSOLUTE BEST service I have literally ever received in my life, I 100% genuinely mean that. She was SO attentive, kind, fun, caring & helpful to a table full of first timers & even my 4 year old. Watching her interact with other tables she waited on, I could tell she loved her job & was so outstanding at it. Nick (who bussed our table) always made sure we had water in our glasses & dishes cleared when needed. He was so polite & was totally on top of things. I can not tell you how incredibly happy I was with everything over all. I almost forgot to mention how great all our food was. Nice sized portions,  cooked to perfection. Makes me want to drive the 6 hours just to experience this wonderful place again. I would recommend this to anyone.",

Despite the fact that we waited a long time for our food and stayed 2.5 hours there, the servers were actually great.  Our server was only 4-days into her training and she was very attentive.  Bread selection before dinner was unique with assorted bagel crisps and some strong anise (I think) flavored bread.  We ordered the chopped liver appetizer and it was decent given it was my first time trying it.  My parmesan crusted New York strip steak was medium rare as requested and tasted great.  The Parmesan crust was not very prominent and didn't add much so wasn't necessary in my opinion.  The sides (potatoes au gratin, onion rings, mushrooms) were okay but nothing special.  Dessert was my favorite course.  We shared their triple layer chocolate cake and chocolate sundae.  Cake was soft and chocolatey of course.  The sundae was very frozen vanilla ice cream in a chilled glass with dark fudge and fresh whipped cream on the side.  The sundae was delicious but could have used more toppings.  \"Where are the nuts?!\" my aunt said. We also got envious of our neighbors' amazing looking giant banana cream pie and turtle brownie.",

Other than that, just about a 5-star rating.  We didn't have reservations so we walked in and the hostess said about an hour and 15 minutes. Tables and customers were turning around left and right, which was a good sign. We waited about 40 minutes.   Service was awesome, our waitress (Claire), was super nice, checked on us often and was pleasant. After we ordered and got our appetizer (delicious calamari), we ended up waiting a very long time for our main course to be served. Claire checked on us a few times and apologized.   My rib eye steak (rare +) was cooked to perfection! The Shrimp Marinara was AWESOME, loved my potato au gratin and salad was good. Overall a great dining experience. A must dine if you're in the area for a SF Giants spring training game or just stopping by. Reservations recommended. Full bar, $5 valet parking and tons of sports memorabilia! Loved it!",

And even at 7:30 the front was wall to wall as was the entrance and the bar and the dining room all confirming that so many have experienced the pleasure of the company here. The staff is top notch. From the hostess to the bartender to our amazing server our experience was great! I had the Chicken limone which was excellent. Served with wilted spinach and mushrooms.I added the potato au gratin and was a great meal. The presentation of the full bone short rib was likewise amazing.  But my only wish is to be granted the pleasure of spending about an hour in the place to explore examine and enjoy the mementos before opening someday. Wow, the stuff I saw made me want to interrupt the patrons to see what is on the wall behind every table.  I heard rumors of the days being numbered for this place. I sincerely hope that it stays open forever!  Thanks to all of you at Don and Charlies!!! Until next time.",

There is something for everyone on the menu though I think there's more options for meat eaters in the family.  My personal favorites are the rib and BBQ chicken combos and a nice steak in the restaurant or a burger and fries in the bar area.  I am rarely lucky enough to get beef ribs (which are first-come, first serve but run out very quickly due to popularity).  The service is great, and I especially enjoy the gold brick sundae for dessert!

The french onion soup is excellent (worth sharing so you've got room for protein), the onion straws are light, flavorful and not greasy (great for sharing between 2-4 too). The baked potatoes are delish with that salt-crusted skin. We had great service too - all dishes were nicely timed and we never felt rushed.

    "text": "Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.  It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received.   I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant.   It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should.   Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.  We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point.   To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.  Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.",

The memorabilia is FABULOUS!  And definitely gives you something to do while you wait.  I ordered the Parmesan Crusted New York and requested it \"Don's Way\", which is charred.  I also ordered a side of broccoli and a salad.  The salad was fabulous.  I don't know why it was so good, but it just tasted great!  The New York Steak was the best steak I have ever had.  The charred parmesan crust was amazing!  I would highly recommend ordering your meat \"Don's Way\"!!!  The broccoli was just broccoli, which is what I expected.  The steak was also served with grilled onions and mushrooms.  Sooo good!  The only downside to our night was our service.  The waitress took forever to bring us our food, drink orders, etc.  She was just awful.  I would definitely go back to Don & Charlies, even though we had bad service.",

We have always had a great experience but not this time and when I sent an email directly to the company they have never responded to me. We were sat in the room off the bar and we were next to a make shift partition wall and right outside the kitchen door. So to say the ambiance was terrible in an understatement. The server was very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, 2 of the dishes that she spoke VERY highly of were already sold out. It was 7:00 PM and they open around 5:00 PM and they were already sold out of 2 MENU items, not specials.  This is not acceptable. Since we were right outside the kitchen we got to hear all the kitchen noise and chatter also.  Plus we had to keep waiting on the server for refills and other things we needed. Not what I would call \"fine dining\" experience. Overall it was a poor experience and my family expressed their disappointment as well so we will not be going back which is sad since we have been eating there for 30 years. I originally went to the Don and Charlies website to express my disappointment because I did not want to go right to Yelp with a bad review but they never responded to me so I guess THEY REALLY DO NOT CARE.",

I ordered the chicken schnitzel and was surprised by the huge portion (two large pieces). I also ordered the caesar salad which was prepared perfectly. I checked in on yelp and got a free onion ring appetizer large enough to feed ten people. So, guess what I'm having for lunch in a few minutes? woohoo. I'll be back.",

    "text": "Other than catching spring training baseball games, Don & Charlie's is a close number 2 on my to-do list when visiting Scottsdale, AZ.  This establishment should be on every visitor's must do list.  The memorabilia is unsurpassed, the food excellent and the service attentive.   In the lounge area the bar is staffed by veteran bartender Shelly, the single most professional and personable bartender that I have ever encountered.  I travel to Phoenix and Scottsdale for business about 5-6 times per year plus I take in spring training.  After my first visit to Don & Charlies, I walked in and sat down and Shelly looked and me and said hello to me by first name after nearly one year and only my first visit; somehow she remembered me from the previous year.  After sitting down for awhile, it was apparent that Shelly knew all the customers and introduced folks to each other.    On another visit with my wife and in-laws for spring training, she asked me for my business card.  About two weeks later I received a very nice note handwritten thanking me for coming to the restaurant and mentioning my wife and in-laws.  Shelly is by far the best bartender I have had the honor of being served by.   I stopped in two nights ago for dinner and a glass of water and the next day I had an e-mail message thanking me and wishing me a happy Thanksgiving.  That is service that is unsurpassed.  I would recommend Shelly and Don & Charlie's to all baseball fans who travel to Scottsdale for spring training and to those just visiting during the off-season.  One word of caution, during the season, they take reservations one-month in advance unless you try to sit and eat in the bar.",

Their au gratin potatoes were bland and the twice baked potato was burned on top and the insides were overpowered with bacon and onion flavor. Service was great, and creme brule for desert was delicious. Don't need to come back...",

The only thing I was disappointed in was that I remembered them having onion strings but today they had rings. Not nearly as good as the strings. Other than that the New York steak, fried chicken, shrimp scampi (Chicago style) and ribs were all great. If you are going to go make a reservation.",

Her name was Pam and she was excellent in explaining, suggesting ideas, and quick service. The onion strings appetizer is piled high on the plate and was hot and crisp. Our cocktails were exceptional and they have a great variety for all at the table. I enjoyed my coconut shrimp entree and it was more than I could eat since their salads are wonderful with lots of homemade dressings to try and chilled well and delicious. I tried my daughters prime rib and hands down we all agreed best prime rib anywhere! Since it was my birthday I was served a house sundae that is similar to eating a Klondike bar. Yummy ending to our meal and plus I got to blow out a candle! Fun evening and positively going back again soon!!",

It was obvious she was used to this environment and did a super job taking care of us.  I had the filet duo which was cooked to my liking and it was delicious.

I remember going to Don & Charlie's for an elite event a few years ago and especially loving the creme brulee because there was a rich chocolate layer that gave you the sense the entire dish was built on a hershey's bar!   We came to Don & Charlies last week as a part of our Steak Out (search for the best steak in the Valley) --I recommended it with dessert in mind! -- and within 3 bites, we could confidently say this was not it!   My tomato soup was good but that's about the only nice thing I can say about this visit!  Overall, the experience failed to meet expectations.  My fillet was barely seasoned and was cooked to medium well, despite being ordered medium. We discussed sharing our disappointment with the waitress but we noticed others weren't sending food back, so we figured it was common practice for the kitchen.  The cheesy bread appetizer (complimentary with check in) took forever to arrive, so by the time it did I had had my fill of bread from the standard issue basket.  There was nothing notable about the creamed spinach.  The chocolate at the bottom of my creme brulee more closely resembled a faint layer of chocolate pudding than the rich, chocolatey hershey's bar I remembered.  Sadly, I'm in no rush to go back.",

When it came time to order the entrees our server said \"We are out of Chicken Limone.\" My boss immediately told her that is why we're here. She came back with the manager who honestly explained that his chef went on vacation and he wasn't happy with how the current chef made the Chicken Limone so he didn't want to offer it. We thanked him for his transparency and because of that my boss said she would like to try it anyway and it was great. He promised he would watch him cook it.   We will be back.",

Filet mignon was cooked perfectly, you get complementary cheese bread and the real winner, in my book, is the deli style cole slaw.  Not enough could be said about Jamie's service. Guy was on point and very personable. Really enjoyed my time at the bar here",

My one client said he wished his beer was colder.  15 minutes later he had an ice cold beer and fresh frosted mug every time.  The prime rib was tender and full of flavour. One of the orders was undercooked.  Fixed no problem.  Very polite and efficient.  The steak was to much for my boss to finish and he's not one to waste a great piece of red meat.  Small table and low ceilings made it very easy to chat and all 6 able to be a part of the conversation. 2 soft talkers in the group so that's a big deal.  Yea there were a couple bumps but they were fixed quickly and politely.  The whole group enjoyed the evening.",

Every season my family arrives to go to spring training they insist on Don and Charlie's.   Drawbacks include the noise. It is almost deafening. There is 1 chair  to sit when waiting a long time for a table despite reservations. The food is the most salty food ( I had trout almandine and blanched spinach in olive oil and garlic with their signature baked potato ) that I have eaten in world travel. I think this restaurant could do well to cut the salting down by 90% and still surpass the minimum daily requirements. Go and see the memorabilia. Don't go just to eat unless you have no issues with so much salt that it affects negatively on the food's favor. This is the last time I eat at this restaurant. I will just go with my family, have a drink and gawk at the collection.",

Don and Charlie's is a cool chophouse in downtown Scottsdale that has a huge collection of autographed baseballs behind walls of glass. You'll often see Major League Baseball players and personalities dining here during Spring Training in March.   They have great steaks, pasta, and some of the best bbq ribs that you will find.   The food at Don and Charlie's will remind you of the great chop houses in Chicago such as Harry Caray's, The Chicago Chop House, and Gene and Georgetti. This should come as no surprise as one of the founders of Don and Charlie's grew up in Chicago.   The winners at Don and Charlie's are the calamari as an appetizer, the cheesy au gratin potatoes as a side, the bbq ribs as an entree, and the creme brulee as a dessert.   They also have an extensive wine list and a beer from every Arizona Spring Training team's city.  Great food, good atmosphere, and just an all around fun dining experience give Don and Charlie's five stars.",

Probably not for everyone, but this is one those timeless establishments that at least bring me back to a time when things were simpler. I love everything about Don & Charlie's, you guys rock, thank you.  You need to get the ribs if it's your first time, the burger is worth talking about, broasted chicken, steaks, fries, potatoes and cole slaw. I prefer the bar room, more casual, you can catch a game, but if it's your first time or a more special night, then the dining room is cool too. Famous sports memorabilia everywhere.",

They were tough and dry, and the meat was very skimpy, barely enough to keep the bones together.  My brother also had ribs, we were served a 1-ounce container of sauce for the two of us.  Fries were tasteless and cold when served.  Seeing how long it took to get a straw, I felt complaining was pointless.  This place seems to be living on it's rep.",

    "text": "Don & Charlie's is one of those restaurants that is a nice addition to add to your \"favorite list.\"  We are from out of state, but when visiting we always find an evening for dinner at Don & Charlie's.  The ambience is the best. The restaurant is moderately lit, with lovely dark wood walls, the tables are covered with white tableclothes. Every empty wall space, including the ceiling (well what used to be empty) is covered with a piece of baseball history (there is a smattering of football items too) The lobby provides the best view of some of the prized pieces of memorbillia.  Our service was terrific from start to finish.  The hostess greeted us promptly, and was very cordial.  She showed us to our table and gave us our menus. . We were only seated 30 seconds when we had ice water and a plate of bread. Our waiter came to the table within two minutes dressed in black slacks, a white dress shirt, black bowtie and a bibbed, long, black apron.  He welcomed us, told us about a special, and took our drink order. Just one negative here, the bread was stale and sort of tasteless and the butter was frozen so solid we were unable to use it.  I was envious of the folks seated across from us. It was their first visit and they received the complimentary cheese bread. I wish now that we had said we were first-timers too.....lol  We had the creamy cole slaw to start.  I love cole slaw and this rated in the top 5 in taste, but the very fine grate made it soupy. I would prefer a coarser grate of the cabbage.  We all ordered different entrees. I had the prime rib, cooked to perfection served with the best raw horseradish I've ever tasted.  The entree came with your choice of potato and I opted for the red potato, mashed (very good, but the serving was twice what I could eat). The prime rib was excellent, I'm not sure I've ever tasted better.  The two others in the group ordered nut encrusted halibut and coconut shrimp and they too gave rave reviews.    The waiter checked on us often, our water glass was always full, and we had our check within minutes of passing on dessert.  If they hadn't served the stale bread, this would have been four stars.",

    "text": "An expensively unpleasant dining experience  I have dined from street vendors to top of the line 5 star restaurants. I can be very appreciative but I also expect to get a good return on my monetary output. Six friends and family members and myself were going to the Botanical gardens and decided to make an evening of the occasion by dine out. Not being familiar with the area we used my Open Table account to search for a restaurant to seat 7 at 6:00 pm on Saturday,April 16th in the Garden's vicinity. Availability was limited so I was pleased to find an opening at 5:45 at Don and Charlie's. They had a good rating, good reviews, good menu, ambiance, sounds great right? Wrong. From the onset the experience was unpleasant. The main group of 5 arrived before myself and husband but they were informed the party wouldn't be seated until all guest had arrived. I received a text from my sister telling me there was no available self parking and to use the valet (a surcharge of $5 not including a gratuity). When seated we were lead back into a back room while having to squeeze past the chairs of other guest and maneuver past servers. Our waitress came by twice and belted out in a loud, albeit necessary because of the volume of the surrounding noise, voice that she would be right back to take our drink order. The waitress finally returned and using the same loud voice took our drink order. A good 45 min had elapsed by thus time. When she returned with the drinks she was going to leave without taking our food order, it was only due to our insistence that she took our orders. When delivered the order was incorrect, the quality of the food, in my case, prime rib was tasteless and coated with butter, the presentation-there was none. It was difficult to enjoy the meal while being jostled by other guest, waitresses and bus staff; it was difficult to hear and impossible to have a group conversation, rather than maneuver around the crowd, the staff reached so far over the table it was invasive. I would definitely question whether or not the legal fire department approved seating capacity of the restaurant is being exceeded. Had there been a fire I can guarantee that they would not be able to evacuate in an orderly or expedited manner - Definitely not worth the price tag.  Oh yes, The highly touted sports memorabilia would be difficult to see at best given the crowded conditions and the poor lighting but I guess if you are a sports idiot it could be a positive aspect of this miserable restaurant.",

Hmmm  FIrst visit -  Very impressed by this museum-alike restaurant with all collections of baseball, hall of fame, jerseys, baseball bats, or you name it, all about sports! The manager or a guy in nice shirt got us a free cheese bread on the bar while we were waiting for our table as it was our first time, the cheese bread tasted almost like the Chicago-styled deep dish cheese pizza. Our order of medium rare prime rib and the BBQ pork ribs arrived pretty quickly after order is placed and the food was delicious.  Second visit - We come back with a group of 6 the next Saturday, reservation was made for 7pm and just about 10 mins wait and we were seated. Waitress was an older lady who took care of us very well when took our ordering, however, one of the broccoli sides (and it happened to be mine) came out way over-cooked, you can so easily by the almost yellow-ish color when there was a comparison to a well-cooked one, and the taste was just...(don't even want to describe). When asked for a replacement, I was told that it has to be re-ordered, not sure what that means, but sure, i'll wait for another one...5 mins later, 10 mins later and.... until we finished our dinner, the broccoli still did not show up... the waitress had a few other tables and seems very busy, she came only once to check and left right after, I didn't even get a chance to 'chase' my broccoli...I guess it was good that 'extra order of broccoli' did not show up on the bill... And it took way to long for her to understand how to split the bill even when we wrote it down by credit card and amount... So be sure to tell your waiter or waitress to split your bill before it arrives!  p.s. This is a popular restaurant, parking seems to be filled very quickly, you might need to park along the street side or the bank's parking lot across the street...",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated Valentine's on Thursday 2/13, always avoid 2/14, all restaurants way too crowded.  Anyhow, Don and Charlie's was crowded but fortunately, I had made reservations.  They hit the mark right on, we were seated right on time.  Because this was our first visit, Pam, our exceptional waitress, comped us the parmesan bread and it is delicious...next time we visit, I will gladly pay for the scrumptious bread.  The menu is vairied, lots of beef and ribs, seafood and more.  I won't go into what we ate because I humbly believe that whatever you order will be delicious and plentiful.  The atmosphere is a little noisy but that's OK, the vibe makes for the dining experience.  You could go crazy looking at all the sports memorabelia, if you are sports fan, any sport, you will find something to ooh and ahh over.  I have to repeat, Pam our waitress was terrific.  They were unusually busy that night because of a large take-out order that came as a surprise to the restaurant and the wait for our main dish was a little long.  Pam made sure we were informed that all was in order and to be candid, it was nice having a little time between our salads and the main dish.  I understand that a diner or two could have a less than perfect visit to any restaurant but I don't understand how anyone could rate Don and Charlie's anything less than 5 stars.  I can't wait to go back.  Thanks to Pam, you helped make my Valentine's weekend.",

So we went, we got the coconut shrimp, which aren't like I remember them from when I was a kid, but I liked them and I normally don't like shrimp at all. I ordered a double baked (droool.... this is the best item at this restaurant.... all bacon -y and delicious and a house salad which was just ok, but what do you expect, it's a house salad. We also got a slice of chocolate cake that comes with fudge.... the fudge... mmmmmmmm sooooo good! That was definitely a good choice. Chris really went the extra mile to give us really good customer service and we really appreciate that. I guess that is what makes this restaurant stand out.",

Oaky cabernet sauvignon for beef and go for a zinfandel for the barbeque. For the prices, you can't go wrong!",

In retrospect, we needed the Luck 'O The Irish to turn this \"so so\" meal into an exceptional dining experience.  The food was good -- coconut prawns, french onion soup, prime rib -- and the service was warm, pleasant and fast. Actually, too fast. We felt rushed to get through each course so they could clear the table for the hoards of people waiting to get in.  It wasn't anything to write home about, but worth another shot.",

They are very generous and start you with some amazing warm rye bread with chopped liver. Every meal comes with soup, cole slaw then let you choose a potato to go along with your main course.

For one, they're not kidding when they say if you're a fan of sports you'll love this place. There is signed stuff on every square inch of the walls, even the posts that hold the place together. As for the food, it was scrumdidiliumptious. I ordered the New York Parmesan Steak, my sister tried the Skirt Steak, and my dad ordered the BBQ Chicken & Ribs. We were all in love, and we all amazingly finished our portions. We all ordered the mashed potatoes on the side, and they were so creamy and homemade, they were awesome. I wish I had them now... For dessert, I got the \"half\" Hot Fudge Sundae, and it was big. I didn't finish it. My dad ordered the Banana Creme Pie and said it was some of the best he's ever had. So for the food, I loved it! Can't wait to go back. Prices weren't outrageous, just you're average nice dinner price. The server was very friendly and accommodated to everything we needed. Wish I could stay in that place for hours just to look at all of the signed memorabilia. I mean, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays? Come on!",

    "text": "I have been coming to Don and Charlies for six or so years now and have never had a bad experience. I like it here a lot. The ambiance is just different at D&C, it's upscale but it doesn't take itself too seriously. You could easily spend hundreds on some of the best steaks and ribs you've ever had, but you'll never feel out of place or judged. The sports memorabilia all over the walls is cool even for a guy like me who doesn't care much, it's still rad to look around and think of all the history.     The food at D&C is plain killer. You can't go wrong starting with the simple but tasty onion strings or the baked artichoke dip, while neither is a creative masterpiece, they are done right. I'm also a sucker for a wedge salad and they have a good one with house made creamy garlic dressing. Now, I can totally recommend the coconut fried shrimp, they are tender and bursting with flavor, and the marmalade sauce adds a wonderful tang to it, but you come to D&C for the steak and ribs. I have tried most of the ribs and can only say get them. All of them. Just order one of everything, you will eat every bite of the tangy, juicy and tender but not too tender meat. If you aren't a big rib fan, then you only have one other choice, my favorite thing on the menu, the regular cut prime rib... it is perfect. Freaking perfect. Put it on your bucket list and add a twice baked potato. Period.    Don and Charlies is a red blooded American restaurant, meat, booze and sports are everywhere, and it's a blast. Throw in the amazing food and nothing but the classiest service and I dare you not to have a fantastic evening.",

It's the best collection of sports memorabilia in a restaurant that I have seen, and it's all been personally signed/retrieved by the owner (except for one item, I think it was the Bonds baseball).  I would have given it 5 stars, but when I ordered my Petite steak, they came back 15 mins later to tell me they ran out and that i could order a very rare steak as an option (which i dont like) or I can have them butterfly a Filet Mignon.  I chose the latter and I wasn't impressed.  However everything else was excellent, especially the twice baked potatos.  They gave me a free dessert for screwing my steak up.  But , yeah.  Go for the decor, make a reservation, and enjoy yourself.",

Thank goodness we made reservations, and also that we made them early (5:30 pm).  It was right after a game, and already packed.  We cooled our heels in the awesome bar.  Nobody was in there yet.  The bartender, very friendly, told us to just wait an hour and the bar itself will be packed, too (but we hoped we'd be eating by then).  But the bar has all the baseball memorabilia....wow.  We were finally seated at a corner table, and struck up a conversation first with a local sitting next to us, charmingly complaining about all the tourists running him out of *his restaurant.  And then we started talking to Scott Eyre, seated on the other side of us, a pitcher at that time for the San Francisco Giants.  He had brought his nephew and his friends to dinner.  He was very gracious and we had a marvelous time watching him down a humongous sundae (\"aw, I'll just run a few more laps tomorrow\").  And the food was good, too.  5 stars for the ambiance, the baseball references, the players in sight, decent service and awesome food.",

The restaurant gets full especially during spring break time so we were lucky to score a dinner reservation just 1 day in advance for 8:15pm.

We arrived about 630 on a Sat night and were seated immediately in the bar, which was totally fine. We got a nice booth and our hostess (Molly) gave us a little history on the booth we were seated in. The reason we know her name was the hostess at the desk in front called her over an intercom about 15 times during our dinner \"Molly...can you please come to the front\"!. That was annoying while we were trying to dine and talk during our dinner. It was kind of cheesy considering the prices of their steaks. We actually thought the prices were too high for steak. The atmosphere didn't lend to the amount that was being charged. 40 dollar filet with no sides. No salad. No veggie. No.....! We decided on burgers, a ceaser salad and Mac n cheese. All were pretty darn good. I had the hickory burger with bbq, cheese and bacon. That's literally the best bacon I've ever had. My friend had the green chile burger and loved the heat of the chiles and pepperjack. Mac n cheese was delicious and creamy. The burgers come with coleslaw (deli or creamy), and we both had deli and it was very pungent and vinegary. We topped it all of with banana cream pie which was fresh and had lots of whipped cream on top. Definitely big enough to share. Our service was spot on and Keasha was efficient and friendly.  Oh yeah, you get a bread and butter plate that's pretty forgettable. They should save their money and not even serve it. We had a great overall experience and I would go back just for that bacon.",

You need a reservation to eat here during spring training, for sure, but the rest of the year it's pretty easy to get a table.  I always get the same thing when I come here; cuda cut prime rib cooked medium rare and it's always fantastic. The crust on top is fabulous and its juicy and tender. My sister had the triple crusted filet's on the waitresses recommendation and she said they were cooked perfect. I upgraded to the twice baked potato and the top was crunchy with a soft inside and good flavor. The service has been spot on during my visits, attentive and quick, but not rushed by any means, plus the extra side waiters make sure to keep the water filled and the plates cleared when needed.  We decided on their delicious banana pie for dessert, but had them wrap it up since we were full from our dinner and they graciously did. The piece of pie we got was so big we split it and still had more than enough for each of us! I wouldn't say Don & Charlies is casual, but it's definitely not as buttoned up as City Hall, another favorite. If you're in the mood for a good steak and service in a fun atmosphere Don & Charlies delivers.",

Don trolling restaurant, he knows/knew my guest in wheel chair.  I have photo of us from earlier visit.  Asked him to stop by on his tour around dining room, he finally did, we shook hands, then he was more than condescending, and said to me I talked with his partner of many years, had no idea what he was talking, said he had no interest in talking to us.  Rudeness and /it dementia, dunno which or both.  Will never return here, I do not need to be minimized by an owner to whom we paid north of $100.  Shame on Don Carson to treat a long time customer as he did!",

    "text": "The iconic Don & Charlie's is closing soon, and rightfully so, as the service has gone in the tank.  We have loved this restaurant over the years and have eaten there once or twice a month regularly.  Last night's experience left us agape!  We had a party of six with reservations a few weeks in advance with a request of a round table in the back of the dining room if possible (it tends to be quieter there).  When I checked in, the hostess asked if our entire party was there yet, & I replied no, so she said to tell her when we were all there, which we did.  Soon after, they said our table was ready, so we were escorted to a table in the back like we requested.  There was also a vacant 6 person table beside us.  Looking at the wine list to order both red & white wines, I commented to my friend that it was a very good price for the white wine we both love, and ordered it.  (My husband ordered the red).  We were munching on the bagel crisps, waiting for the wine to arrive, when a gentleman came to our table & asked us our name.  He said we were seated at the wrong table if our name wasn't so & so and we would have to move and had no choice.  We were all perplexed, as THEY had seated us there & knew our name?!    Soooo, we all got up (we aren't young) & waited in the front at another 6 place table while they set it up.  Our \"new\" waitress, Taylor, was delightful so we tried to let it go & have a good time.  When our bill came, our white wine that was a good price we thought, was $10.00 higher, which they did adjust after bringing it to their attention.  Being a business owner, I am so disappointed with the way the seating situation was handled.  We certainly were inconvenienced by their error and they made us feel like it was our fault as we traisped back to the front to be reseated.  No apology was given.  We cancelled our reservations we had made for next week.  I guess it is time for this iconic restaurant to close.    There for the LAST TIME!!  SF",

Steak fries were hot and fresh. Hubby had French onion soup and gave it an 8 out of 10 ... the French restaurant in Kierland got a 6 out of 10!  The only slight negatives ... got loud when crowded, husband's chair was in the isle and people kept bumping in to him, and creamy coleslaw wasn't my favorite. I'd try other one next time.

    "text": "This low rating is mostly for the extremely unpleasant experience with the owner, not so much for the food or service by the staff. I would have given a minus 5 for the owner, if that was a choice, and a 4 or 5 for the food and service. No customer who's spent close to $300 should have been treated the way we were treated by this rude person.  We were in Arizona for Spring Training and heard about this great restaurant with amazing collection of sports memorabilia, so we made a reservation and went to this place after all day of meeting players and going to a baseball game. Everything was awesome and our 2 families with 4 adults and 4 children were having a good time. All of the staff were courteous and good at what they were doing.   Midway through our meal, we noticed that there were some Colorado Rockies coaches and players eating right next to our table. We didn't want to bother them, so we were just eating and chatting. We saw a couple kids going over to them and asked for autographs. Again, we didn't want to be rude and interrupt their pleasant meal, so we were just minding our own business. When it looked like all of the them in the party were about finished with their meal, my 11-year-old went over to one player(a pitcher) and politely asked for an autograph on a baseball. At that point, the owner came charging at our table and started talking to us in a very rude and loud voice. The contents were that he does not allow anyone coming into HIS restaurant to ask for autographs. If we want autographs, we should be going to baseball fields 7am in the morning and get them there...which by the way, we did...we went to a baseball training facility earlier in the morning and met many players...2 straight days. He added in a very angry and rude voice that this is the LAST TIME he's going to say this.   Are you kidding me? I could understand an owner of a restaurant getting fed up with all kinds of rude \"fans\" asking for autographs to these athletes who are there just to eat, but it was the way he communicated this to us, grown adults. It was so embarrassing being treated this way by some insane man. As I'm getting up from the table with my children, one of the staff members apologized to me for the owner's rudeness and told me that he's always extremely rude like that. The staff also added that I should definitely speak up and let others know.  The funnier thing was that as we were walking out of the restaurant, feeling confused at the way how we were talked to and treated, I see 3 guys walking out from behind us, holding a baseball each, talking about getting players' signatures and how lucky they were to take pictures with them as well. So I asked them if they, too, got yelled at by the owner. They were very surprised at what happened to us.   I tried to give the owner the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe he mistakenly thought that my son was with the other kids that \"bothered\" the players. These kids spent good 5 minutes or longer, talking to the players and getting signatures from several of them. My son went over for 10 seconds and came right back to our table. Well, my two boys were the only Asian boys in the restaurant at the time. I am not pulling the racial card. I'm making a point that there was no room for a mistake for recognition of who was who.  Moving forward, if this is such an important issue to him, the owner should have a clear sign somewhere visible and let the customers know that the privacy of all of his customers are important and ask politely to refrain from asking anyone for autographs. I'll totally understand this policy.  It was such a shame that all of us walked out of this restaurant feeling wronged and bitter for no clear reason. We were their customers, after all. I hope that whoever is looking to visit this place be fully aware of this owner's policy regarding getting signatures, because we clearly had no idea and got yelled at for no reason.",

Quickly served to each table was a dish with three small scoops of chopped liver, mock chopped liver,  charosis, and 1 piece of  gefilte fish, all to share. Then they served matzo ball soup, not hot. Then came your choice of roast chicken, brisket or fish.  Supposedly served with sweet carrots and potato kugel.  However it was 1 small dish of carrots to share and 2 small pieces if kugel to share. Finally, came dessert which most thought was good.  No coffee or wine was served.  All for the grand total of $36.95 plus tax and gratuity. The food was thrown at us, and if we asked for another piece of fish or vege. we were told NO... We have eaten at Don and Charlie\"s numerous times in the 17 years I've lived in Phoenix and it was always good. Passover Seder was diplorable!",

    "text": "I grew up eating at Don & Charlie's and honestly it's gone downhill especially for the prices they charge which just went up again.   The dining room is nostalgic but it's tired. They are still using cheap plates and glasses and for the prices and childlike presentation, it's really weak!  Additionally, they pack you like sardines, as my wife got her chair bumped by the waitstaff 4 times without even an apology.   Food- it's good not great. We had the chopped liver to share and it's decent at best and if you grew up on this stuff, you won't think it's anything special. I ordered the broasted chicken $19, and u get 3 pieces ( drum, thigh and breast) while it was good, truthfully not nearly worth that price in the least. Sadly, a step above KFC.  Others had the ribs & if you know BBQ, this is not!  These ribs are not smoked and therefore it's not BBQ as these appear to be baked, meh!  Coleslaw, not fancy but very good. Baked potato, it's just that. Other sides- mashed, broccoli, fries again just pedestrian.  Would I go again? Sure only to sit in the bar area for a burger. Skip the dining room, service is poor and food is average for prices seen in top prime steakhouses.  Sorry Don, u look great after losing all that weight but this dining experience was very disappointing!",

So if your a sports fan, this would be a nice place to go to enjoy your steaks or prime ribs. This place may look old and out of style, but it still attracts  a lot of clientele, which I noticed are very well affluent retirees living in Scottsdale.   The servers are excellent, very helpful attentive to our needs. We didn't need to ask for the water to be refilled,  the waiters are constantly refilling without being asked.   As for the prime ribs, that was tender. the Ribeye was cooked to perfection. .Choose the coleslaw with mayo. .that tasted pretty good.The shrimp cocktails was over cooked. .but that didn't matter because the cocktail was tangy with a little spice. .now that saved the a slight over cooked shrimp. Pam the waitress was awesome! ! Recommended a delicious wine, cabernet for our dinner.",

Our bartender and server were very nice, and the bussers regularly came by to clear our table.  The hostesses seemed frazzled with the reservations, walk-ins, and phone ringing. I have to assume that during spring training, it's like that every night so they're used to it, but the host desk seemed discombobulated.    The food came out more quickly than I expected, given the size of the place and how busy it was. The food was decent, but nothing spectacular.  Our table had everything from ribs to prime rib to filet to chicken sandwiches, and everything tastes fine. It's worth going because of the amazing memorabilia they have.  It's very old school otherwise.  Dark interior with no windows and lots of booths.  There's also valet, which is very helpful.",

It is literally a sports museum with every type of sports memento you can imagine.  But this is also the place for you if you like plentiful, well prepared food and very good service.   A bread basket was served which consisted of rye bread covered with onion bits & garlicky bagel chips with butter.  Fresh and delish.   We started dinner with two house salads consisting of iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes and croutons.  The salad was huge.  The blue cheese dressing actually had chunks of blue cheese in it which I totally enjoyed. Texas toast with a Parmagiana cheese crust was served prior to the main entrees.  Very yummy.  I had the NY strip steak garnished with delicious onion rings.  It was accompanied by a baked potato which was peppered and salted on the outside prior to baking.   The steak was a little overdone as I had asked for it medium Rare and it came out medium.  Nice char on the steak and it was mighty good.  Hubby's pecan crusted trout was good with one exception.  There was an excessive amount of butter/oil? on the plate. That was the only fault with the fish.  For dessert we had the \"bric\" sundae---large scoop of ice cream with a hardened chocolate top.  The service was attentive without being overbearing which made our meals all the better.  We will be back!",

I was worried that it wouldn't live up to my memories.  Fortunately the place doesn't look like it has changed since \"We are the World\" was tearing up the pop charts and the food hasn't either, in a good way.  First, the chopped liver is a must. They'll ask if you want it, just say yes, even if you think you don't like liver.  I think I don't like liver and I can tell you that I'm mistaken.  I had the fish of the day (Mmmm. That sounds good, I'll have that.); halibut, broiled.  My wife had prime rib, rare and we both had the Au Gratin.  We demolished it all and wished that there were more.  There wasn't.  So we had a hot fudge sundae and key lime pie for dessert.  This was the only minor disappointment. The sundae was good but the hot fudge they serve it with was nearly cold. The key lime pie was a little mild for my taste.  Give me my fudge hot and my pie bold, I always say (I've never said that).  Don & Charlie's is an old standby for a reason, so go check them out.  Or drop back in if the last time you visited was for your post Hands Across America party.",

It was a Thursday evening so it was not very busy but I happened to see everyone's favorite sheriff , Joe Arpaio, sharing a meal with some friends. To be safe, reservations are recommended.  The food was spectacular. They serve chopped liver with bread. The bread was delicious; the liver, eh, not my favorite. My dad though couldn't get enough of it. We ordered prime rib, BBQ chicken and ribs. Everyone was very much satisfied. For dessert, we shared creme brulee. Just loved the entire meal!  For the most part, the service was great. Even the bus boys were very polite and helpful throughout the meal. Our server ever offered us two free desserts because we were celebrating two occasions! My only complaint was when I ordered a cheese burger, our server told us burgers could only be ordered in the bar... but it was on the menu. Shortly after we got our food, the table next to us, had a burger delivered to their table!!! Then a burger was delivered to Sheriff Joe's table too! What the heck!?!? I was very satisfied with my order but they need to get that burger situation figured out because it looked damn good and next time I go, I want the damn burger! haha",

The chopped liver at the beginning of the meal was also a nice bonus!  Only cons would be that the french fries were mundane. Also, we were a little confused about what was a part of the meal (sides, soups, etc), what was an upcharge, what we couldn't add, etc. It wasn't outlined on the menu, and our server had to explain a couple of times.

We both had beef on the brain, but started with a calamari fritti appetizer, followed by D&C's caesar and the wedge salad. My wedge was smothered with still-sizzling bits of applewood smoked bacon over bleu cheese dressing--incredible! Rich had a perfect medium rare prime rib, and my ribeye steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare as well. Although it was a great steak, I would probably not order it with their signature char crust. I think the meat was so tender, it would have been fine with just salt and pepper seasoning. Our server, Christina, was the perfect combo of attentive and non-intrusive, with a strong side of helpfulness. If the walls of Don & Charlie's could talk, it would roar with the voices, stories and camaraderie of my sports heroes who have frequented this establishment-- Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and Will Clark, to name a few.

The waitress was really friendly, and took our drink order pretty quickly after we sat down. Then she brought over a basket of toasted thin sliced bagels and rye bread. Yuck... We asked for just regular sourdough and they didn't have any. So she brought a basket of French bread with cheese, on the house. Nice gesture but the bread was greasy and flavorless. Next, my mother in law and I ordered the salmon. We were informed that they had ran out of salmon. So scanning the menu, I decided to get the broasted spicy chicken. My husband ordered the ribs, my mother in law ordered chopped beef with peppers and onions, one daughter ordered hamburger, and my other daughter ordered mac and cheese. Soon after taking our order the waitress brought out cole slaw for us and bland apple sauce for the mac and cheese. Bland and boring. None of us ate more than a bite. Then she brought out my fried chicken, with no garnish or anything else on the plate and a burnt looking baked potato. No garnish. Same with everyone else's plates. My chicken was juicy and had a good flavor, but NOT worth $17! Mother in law got what looked like a giant hamburger patty. Totally dry and flavorless. No onions, no peppers. The ribs were ok, nothing spectacular. The hamburger was as expected. But the mac and cheese was aweful. Lots of dry cheese on top, my daughter wouldn't eat it. Everything was very expensive. After dinner I was done but one of my kids wanted to try the chocolate cake. It was a small piece and tasted like what you would buy at the grocery store.   The food here is bland and boring and bad. We will never ever go here again. There are too many great restaurants in the Scottsdale area to waste tons of money here. I can't believe this place is in business.",

My salad arrived and was presented beautifuly. The only pboblem was it wasnt the right salad. I sent it back and when the salad arrived it was half the size and obviously thrown together by an angry kitchen who had to remake it. By this time I lost my appetite. The server sentcthe manager over a heavy set woman who came over ans said. I heard you didnt like your salad, not Im sorry your salad came out wrong twice. Shevthan told me I wouldnt have to pay for it. Well since I didnt eat it and our dinner was ruined I wouldnt expect to pay for it. Very bad customer service. I would think twice about returning. Were people who eat there all year round, not just in the winter.",

    "text": "My family and I moved to Scottsdale over 20 years ago and I have always had a place in my heart for Don & Charlie's.  We used to go there often for birthdays/anniversaries/graduations, etc.  It was my birthday this week and my parents wanted to take me out so I said \"Let's go to Don & Charlie's, I haven't been there in I don't know how long\".  Sadly, after having eaten there I believe that I made a mistake with this suggestion.  The restaurant itself hasn't changed since the last time I was there - it's still got wall-to-wall memorabilia, it still has the same old-school steak house ambiance, but the feeling that I got during and after the meal was really one of a restaurant that is resting upon its laurels and not doing much to deliver a quality product.  My Caesar salad was made with lettuce that was obviously old - it was not wilted, but it was very soft and floppy with no crunch to it whatsoever.  My father ordered the creamy coleslaw which bore a great resemblance to cabbage soup so high was the dressing to cabbage ratio.  My mother greatly enjoyed her house salad with a balsamic dressing but this was mostly because she thought the balsamic was the best that she had had in a long while.  All three of us ordered baby back ribs for dinner - my parents just had the ribs, I had a combo with the ribs and a filet.  All three of us remarked that the ribs were \"passable\",  the meat was tough and fatty - not at all what I remember in terms of quality from when I used to eat there.  I have honestly had ribs that I found more enjoyable at casual restaurants like TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's.  When you are charging $30 for a rack of ribs, they REALLY need to be better than \"acceptable\" which was the highest grade I could offer on these.  While ordering our entrees, my mother asked which ribs were more tender and our server informed us that the beef ribs were the most tender, but they had sold out of their entire stock of beef ribs already.  Our reservation was at 6:30 - fairly early in the evening, so my mother's reaction was \"Really?\"  His response - \"Oh yes, they were actually sold out at 5:00 PM.\"  This speaks to a lack of organization and knowledge on the part of management - if you are running out of a popular item by 5 PM on a weekend before proper dinner service even begins then that indicates a serious problem.  My Filet was better than acceptable - it was not as good as I remember, but still very good.  Unfortunately my disappointment in the ribs was such that it overshadowed any feelings I may have had about the steak.  Our server was professional and courteous and I did not notice any of the issues with the hostesses that some others have reported, but I really have to say that I am disappointed in Don & Charlie's.  It's one thing to go back to a place you have a fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation what you remember - we all have a tendency to look at the past with rose-colored glasses I think.  This was a case of going to a place that I have a genuine fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation to what I consider acceptable for any high end restaurant.  I believe my grade of \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is completely accurate - I have experienced better at other steak houses, at other casual dining restaurants, even hole-in-the wall eateries where I used plastic utensils to eat my meal.  I say this as someone who has nothing but fond feelings for D&C's - you guys need to improve, because a wall full of signed baseballs and dim lighting will only take you so far.",

The steak is always cooked to perfection and I have recently fallen in love with the spicy broasted chicken. It is the perfect combination of crispy and juicy. I would love to shake the hand of whomever created this fabulous meal. I have only sat in the dining room a handful of times but the atmosphere is very light but also extremely inviting. I have sat in the lounge or at the bar for most of my visits. As a sports fan there is always a game to be watched and they almost always have the game I want to watch on. The service staff is extremely attentive and have never had an empty glass in all the times I have visited. If you have not been to don and charlies now is for sure the time to go. If you haven't been back in a while what are you waiting for?? Don and charlies gets a 5 star rating from me. Can hardly wait until my next visit.",

    "text": "After the Padres Spring Training game, we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entree or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!",

I then arrived with my party of 4 we were seated promptly. I then went through the whole process one more time with the waitress every detail, the thrid time I addressed this for one dinner. the food came and my $40 steak was covered in something deep fried. My waitress to her credit noticed it and the food was never set down. the manger then came to apologize and assured me it was only canola oil, not soy or corn, which I do not have an allergy to. I still politely refused and reminded him that they fry all of there shell fish in that same oil. they were very nice about every thing but 2 phone calls plus discussing it with the waitress should have been enough even then they attempted to convince me it was fine as it was canola oil they failed to mention that shell fish is fried in it all night every night. they offered to comp me a meal in the future but I just don't take those kind of risks so I politely refused again. They were very professional the whole time but I would not eat there if you have food allergies",

The food is consistently good, which is why we usually make it to Don & Charlie's for various birthdays or holidays. This time, it was Father's Day. Two words for you: chopped liver. It's fantastic. You could make an entire meal out of it, as it really is the best thing going here. However, then you'd miss out on their shrimp de jonghe, also the very best incarnation of this dish you'll find in the Valley. Their steaks are good but not great - nowhere near the quality of places like Mastro's or J&G - but the price is right when you factor in the sides they come with. The sides are very good - the salad with creamy garlic dressing, the cole slaw, and the potatoes au gratin are winners. The dessert selection isn't particularly exciting, but they dishes they do offer are good, from a light and tart key lime pie to a sweet, creamy banana cream pie.",

Lucky for me, I am the only one in my family that likes the liver. :) Their steaks are the BEST! I asked why my sirloin cuts like a filet and is so tender...I was told that their meat is prime. That explains that. The prices are fabulous for the quality and the portion sizes. I have never ever finished a meal. 16 oz parmesan crusted sirloin with all of the trimmings for $23.95!! I Also have to mention the mac and cheese. The best ever, so cheesy. Since I LOVE dessert, I never miss one here. I have had them all. My favorites are the banana cream pie and anything with the hot fudge. (I have been known to buy some to take home.) Service is always top notch. ENJOY!",

    "text": "I was down in AZ for a college baseball tournament and my dad had come down to watch me play.  He heard that if you wanted to be surrounded by baseball and have the chance to mingle with current and former players, Don and Charlie's was the place to go.  If you are a baseball fan, this is the closest you will get to Cooperstown without having to go to New York!  As soon as you enter the doors you are surrounded by baseball heaven!  Two things that really stand out:  The Hall of Fame case which has probably 30 baseballs signed by the greatest to ever play the game (Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Ted Williams etc).  Second, the mural of the '69 Cubs with signatures on the wall (never seen anything like that before).  Needless to say I was amazed by this place.  Although the food was great the atmosphere is what captivated me.  We had the opportunity to meet Don (oddly enough we were seated right next to him in the dining area) and he was one of the nicest people you will ever meet, but maybe that's because we are both from Chicago!  Oh and one more thing...as we were finishing our meal who comes walking from a back room?  One of the greatest coaches in MLB history Joe Torre!  What an amazing experience, if you are ever within driving distance of Don and Charlie's you should make it a priority to eat at this fine baseball-themed establishment!!!",

There's always something new you haven't seen before. It's the perfect place to eat and study what is around you.  I had the crusted Parmesan cheese steak. I had tomato bisque and the string onions. Those are good! I had the steak and it felt like it was missing something. I'm not sure what as I don't eat steak a lot.   The soup was great. It was a cup and perfect. The onion strings were good. The steak was ok. I'll always go back, but not for steak. I also wish their menu was more broad with more items to choose from.",

The service was quick and competant, and friendly enough even though we did stay a few minutes past their stated closing time... While all of us were hungry, none of us orded traditional entrees, preferring to eat appetizers instead. I had a delicious shrimp cocktail made with massive prawns, an incredible macaroni side dish that was great, and shared a coleslaw dish with a friend that we both agreed was quite good, even though neither of us arre fans of coleslaw per say... I think the overwhelming presence of carrots in the dish won both of us over. Yea, I'll come back, no problem.",

    "text": "I went to Don & Charlie's with my wife, in-laws and daughters on Christmas Eve.  This ended up being anything other than a normal night out.  Shortly after ordering, there was a commotion at the table next to us.  An elderly man was apparently choking and another man from his party (I later learned his son) was trying to help by doing the Heimlich maneuver.  He was not succeeding.  I went through Heimlich training twice before each of my daughters was born, so I went to help.  I took over from the son and managed to get some of the food to dislodge.  Another diner reminded me to stand the choking man up out of his chair, after which I was able to get the rest of the food dislodged.  The family of the choking man was very nice and grateful for my involvement (they bought our drinks) and our waitress was thankful as well (she gave us my dessert on the house).  In the end everyone went home safely having eaten a good meal.  Here's my problem -- though my waitress pointed me out to one of the owners, I never got so much as a \"thanks\" from him or a manager.  The dessert was nice as were the thank-yous from fellow diners, but I find it amazing that management didn't bother to say anything.  Look, I am not saying they should have put my name up in lights, but when a patron is choking and can't breath and another patron resolves the situation, I would expect ownership/management to at least be as nice and thankful as all the other diners sitting near us who said thank you.  The food is good, the decor is fun, but management is missing common sense.",

I joined some old friends for dinner at Don and Charlies at the recommendation of my friend's family. To be fair I am a \"foodie\",so this might seem a little harsh.  . The first thing I received when I walked into the place was the smell of mold mixed with some industrial cleaner,probably the most pleasant  aroma that I had throughout the evening and of course the duct tape all over the old carpet was quite attractive..My server  informed us that she had worked there for 30 years..Wow. Unfortunately for her time here she couldn't answer  our questions very well. We asked about the  so-called Prime beef ,if that actually meant Prime Grade  Beef  she seemed dumbfounded and if it was wet or dry aged.Also inquired what was in the rice pilaf ( vegies,stock etc) still no definitive answer,what size were the shrimp . We were not trying to harass the server we  have some  dietary needs and we were trying to  get some entrees and appetizers  that we could all share.We decide on  the chopped liver,the rib appetizer and a couple of wedge salads,caesar,and a french onion soup to begin followed by salmon,New York ,prime Rib,BBq cicken,Bone in Rib eye and ,halibut. The ribs were not very meaty and extremely tough  probably the worst that I have ever had,,french onion tasted like knorr beef stock and liver..and we all love pate, was quite frankly disgusting. The steaks were ok but not prime grade the salmon was previously frozen  farm raised Atlantic salmon the deli cole slaw was decent the creamy tasted ok but exactly like the Colonel's The BBq chicken was gross.,Halibut was so-so. All and all  my review of the place would be outdated cuisine prepared without skill or love but with the same price points as high end steakhouses in the area. The place just looks old and tacky with ripped chairs, old smelly carpet,.crud stuck beneath the tables and servers who  are as antiquated as the establishment..Comfort food? Only if you are comfortable with ghetto crap food . Sorry Charlie (and Don)",

We felt welcomed the moment we sat down. She greated us as if we knew her for a long time. She had a great knowledge of the menu,  history of the place,  and shared some fun stories. We ended up ordering 2 appetizers cheesy bread and the Coconut Shrimp. Both were good. The onto our coleslaw YUM just like Granny's. Our entree was cooked just how we asked for it. Lots of food and tons of Choices. OUr dessert we split a Creme Brulee which was amazing as well. From start to finish our experience was fantastic and I cant wait to come back next year.. I just hope we get to sit and visit with Christine again..You guys have a gem there I hope you treat her and your serving staff they way they deserve becasue they all looked like they worked like crazy but appearred to be having fun doing..

    "text": "You step into the restaurant and are right away immersed in decades of sports memorabilia and history, it seems quite a few famous people frequent the place. For someone who doesn't eat red meat, the menu is a little lacking.  Not that there is anything wrong with this, I was still able to find a selection that put quite the smile on my face.   The only part of my meal that wasn't as good as I remembered from the last time I frequented D&C's many years ago was the lack of a Roquefort salad dressing, the garlic house dressing over top the fresh greens was still enjoyable though. I had the spicy broasted chicken. For those of you wondering what it is, it's cooked in a pressurized fat fryer. Much akin to KFC's original chicken, but with a slight burn from the extra southern kick. The flavors, taste and overall experience are another thing entirely. This had to have been some of the best chicken I've had in a long time that I didn't cook myself. Perfectly crispy, not a hint of grease anywhere. Accompanying the meal was a side of the cheesy au grautin potatoes, I could only eat half of it due to the feeling of my blood starting to slow down considerably in my arteries. Overall, a delicious meal.   I will advise not to get the prickly pear margarita unless you like your drinks VERY sweet. I usually expect sour when ordering this Arizona option, not hummingbird food. Next time I'll stick with a good beer for hearty food.   Service was impeccable, everyone on the staff was warm and friendly. I would caution about parking though, it's almost non-existent except valet. If you want to park your own car, you'll be walking about a quarter mile to the nearest public parking spots.",

They were able to seat us about 30 mins early so that was awesome.  The place does get pretty crowded so be prepared.  * Don's Iceberg Wedge = very good but pretty standard as far as wedges are concerned.  It wasn't anything special.  * Mumsie's Chopped Steak = this thing is awesome.  It is a full pound of meat mixed with pepper and onions.  It was juicy and delicious.  I couldn't even eat 1/2 of it so I took the rest home.  This is definitely a meal to share.  The fries that came with were excellent and seemed to be pretty fresh.  The ambiance is pretty neat even though I couldn't care less about all that sports crap they have everywhere.  Our waitress was pretty good, was fast and friendly, and didn't mess anything up given the large size of our party and how busy the place was that night.  Oh and the highlight of my meal was that the waitress left me with a large crafe of diet coke right off the bat.  It is almost like she knew I would be constantly bugging her for refills.  Although my wife says getting any of the steaks here would be a waste of money and wouldn't be as good as going to \"a real steak place\", I still would like to give them a shot because most of them sound delicious!    Anyway, it was an excellent meal and I can't wait to return.",

I wish their au-gratin potatoes were a little cheesier though.    My favorite thing about Don and Charlie's is the complimentary chopped liver plate they serve before your meal.  Chopped liver is served with chopped egg and onion and is the best I've had here in AZ.  I always get an extra 1/2 lb to take home.  If you come here during spring training expect the place to be jam packed and rowdy.  You'll probably see more than a few baseball players here also.  It's not the place to come for a leisurely dinner in March.  Other times of the year it's not so bad, and it's easier to wander around and take in all the baseball memorabilia.

    "text": "Do you like meat? Feel like checking out the most legendary restaurant known to the spring training crowd? You've found it.   Don and Charlies was a part of my growing up. Beginning in a booster seat and now as an adult, I've spent many nights enjoying the food and atmosphere at Don and Charlie's. When you walk in, the walls are stocked with pictures of those who've visited over the years as well as some classic memorabilia. The low ceilings give it the feeling of a members-only club. It's Old Arizona to the tee and on most nights, it'll have a wait list out the door of the old timers. I love it here. It could be the memories, the great All-American food, the fact that I had my first date here with my now fiance, the pitchers of diet coke they provide or just the vibrant environment and character...but whatever it is, I'm happy every time I walk inside.   Like I said, it's solid All-American cookin' like BBQ chicken, great tender beef or pork ribs that fall right off the bone, awesome steaks, mouthwatering au gratin potatoes and the list goes on and on. Start with a Cesar salad, order their famous BBQ ribs for dinner, accompany it with Au Gratin potatoes and finish the meal with a Goldbrick Sundae.   Whether you're in town for spring training or you're just up for a going out to dinner, I suggest giving Don and Charlie's a try. This place shouldn't be just an old timer hot spot. I am no old timer and I still enjoy my visits.",

It's definitely a cool place for the sports fanatic, lots of great sports memorabilia donning the walls. I found that the food was actually very good, however you get a ton of it so sharing an entree would be a good option. The crowd was made up of middle aged men and families. Word on the street is that it's a great place to see some of the athletes during spring training.",

Well I can promise most of you that you can make almost the entire Don & Charlie's menu at home. So go for the experience and ambience...it's classic and memorable.

Make sure you have a reservation on Friday and Saturday nights, we had one and by passed a 30 minute wait. Start with an app and hey check in here on yelp and it's FREE! The steak sandwich is unique in that's it's not a sandwich at all but rather a genii round sized steak with cheese bread, best plate at the table in my opinion. Did I mention they had old style, nothing like a fancy steak and a can of old style. You pay for what you get and in this case it's a great ambiance, great food, and great service!",

Even better because even though the lobby was mobbed they sat us right away and we had a great corner table in the main dining room. Since it was early, and just filling up, we had time to chat with our server, Christine. She was fantastic, and not just because we were all from the same town back on Long Island. She told us about serving my all-time baseball hero, Willie Mays, the night before and how he was as great as you think he is.  We had the ribs and the broasted chicken. Almost too much food. And it was perfectly made. Since it was my birthday, Christine brought me a sundae, which of course I had plenty of room to finish!   Overall, a great, fun place. Like being in Cooperstown Hall of Fame, only better. Because they don't serve food and drinks in Cooperstown!",

    "text": "Don is from Chicago. His Partners are Lettuce Entertain You. Chicago boys as well.  This place makes the food desert of Phoenix bearable to live in. I don't have to order food and get it fedex.   You can read the other reviews as most are spot on. Here are a few tips.  If you like ribs that fall off the bone or are really meaty go to Hooters or Famous Daves. These are Ribs like you get at Carsons or Bones in Chicago. In my eyes the best ribs you can get. If you don't like them it is because you don't like Chicago Style. It's you not the ribs.  Everything is now ala carte. The liver. I hate it, my wife loves it. It's not free anymore but it's enough for 3 people.   The meat comes from Stockyards in Chicago. If you were to order them yourself online you will pay more for just the steak than a whole meal here. They are Prime Steaks.   The Skirt Steak is one of my favorites. Again that is if you like skirt steak.  The ribs, I love the ribs, Dons way with sauce on the side.   The wedge salad. Best blue cheese dressing in the world.    The potatoes. Get the Au Gratin. If you like fires get the skinny fries. Instead of steak fries they are fresh cut yet a nice thickness, not skinny like in and out but thinner than Five Guys. I love Five Guys fries by the way. The burgers not so much. The burgers here at D&C are very good though.   The hot fudge sundae is awesome. Really good ice cream homemade hot fudge is to die for and whipped cream is homemade.  Only problem is you don't get enough fudge or cream and they don't give you nuts anymore because of all the folks with allergies.  If you get a steak and it's not the skirt get the filet. Get it medium rare with char crust. If you get it any other way it will either be dry cause it is over cooked or flavorless because they don't use butter or bacon on them to help a fairly tasteless cut of expensive meat. If you get filet at D&C it's because you like filet and love the side dishes and dessert.   The pork chops are not the same as Chicago. They are thin and tough.   It's expensive so share. One dinner is enough for two people to split. My wife and I order the ribs with Au Gratin and a wedge. The only problem is no leftovers. We love the leftovers. There is room for a small hot fudge sundae though.  Go either early or late and sit in the bar area. If their is a sports team or celebrity you will be treated like chopped liver. Don didn't get all those autographs on the wall for nothing. The athletes get served first.",

When we got there to check in (early), they said that they are running about 30 minutes behind. I don't understand how when you make a reservation a month in advance, that there is still a wait time?!   We were dealing with Betsy, the host at the front desk. She was EXTREMELY rude on the multiple occasions that our group had to deal with her. She was not accommodating at all and had a bad attitude.  Once we finally got to our table at around 8:45pm, It took our server over 15 minutes just to acknowledge us and then another 20-25 minutes just to bring out drinks. Once he finally brought our drinks, he forgot two of our 7 drinks. It then proceeded to take him another 20 minutes to get us the remaining 2 drinks.   Once we got the rest of our drinks, then he finally got it together and started being more accommodating. I understand that this is a very popular restaurant and super busy, but they should really do a better job of staffing enough people. (especially for a Saturday night). For having a reservation, we spend most of our time here just waiting around.   On the other hand, the food was AMAZING.  If this were a rating for food alone, the I would give them 5 stars... but the service was just awful.",

Well, I must admit, it was a much better experience than prior.   Jeff F was our server.   Even though it appeared the restaurant was quite busy, he was very attentive.   After checking the wine menu and  giving his advice on what was a good cab, which I solicited, I started perusing the food menu only to see there were bar suggestions.     I quickly had him flagged down and he helped me order my all-time favorite, which the bartender managed to make to perfection.   Ahhhh.    A good start, indeed.     We ordered the cuda cut prime rib and the spicey broasted chicken.    The cuda cut was cooked to perfection and very tasty.   The spicey broasted chicken was flavored with the right amount of spices.   For our sides we ordered the chicken soup, which had large pieces of chicken and well seasoned.   Also ordered were the baked potato and french cut fries.    I liked the fact the baked potato was covered in spices.    No plain jane potato here!  The fries were so-so.    I think it would be a good idea to add a little seasoning to take it out of the ho hum category.       I would categorize my return visit a success and would probably visit again.",

So...here's the latest if everything goes as plan (zoning, plans etc.) they will close Oct 2019 but worst case into 2020.  So there some time to get in for your fix.    Came in the summer (Thursday night) and it was pretty slow so the service was excellent!  Got to our table right away and drink orders were taken right away.  We came with veteran D&C patrons so we knew a little about their menu and what they really liked.   As we walked in.....it really is impressive.  The sports memorabilia is spectacular - one can really spend all day looking at each rooms, it's so impressive.    The food was simply delicious.  I ordered the baby back ribs and my husband got the New York encrusted parmesan blue cheese steak.  We ordered by popular demand the cheese potato au graten and the creamy cole slaw.  Man O man...everything was so delicious.    Could not eat the entire meal and they package everything up very, very nicely.  I was impressed.  Everything I have heard (all good) about Don & Charlies was been spot on the atmosphere, the service and most of all the food.  Great experience.  My husband and I will be back before they close this treasure we have in the Valley.",

If you like chicken, the broasted chicken is out of this world good.  Try the cole slaw too!  Try and control yourself with it though because once you start, you won't be able to stop.  I heard it is the new gateway drug.  I have never had a bad meal here and will continue to frequent this restaurant.  The staff is also amazing and has been there forever and they always have great stories.   If you try and go here during spring training, you better have a reservation because it gets packed early.",

I first dined here about 20 years ago and Tommy Lasorda (RIP) was holding court at the next table.  Since spring training has ended our Sunday night wait was only about 15 minutes. I spent my time checking out all their cool baseball artifacts it's like Cooperstown in the southwest.   Our dinner was fine. Our steaks were seasoned and cooked as ordered. Service was spot on and my leftovers were just as good the next day.   I would definitely recommend this old school eatery to baseball fans or fans of good old school dining.  Review updated as I mistakenly stated that Tom Lasorda had already went to that great ballpark in the sky. Sorry Tommy here's to 10 more years plus of good living!!!",

The service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is lively and nostalgic. If you're a sports fan, it has tons of sports memorabilia. Like every inch of this place is covered with it.  It has that perfectly relaxed old-school vibe. For Chicagoans (and there's certainly no shortage of those in PHX/Scottsdale), this is a little slice of home.",

    "text": "Our first visit last year was very good.  We enjoyed it immensely, to the point of recommending Don & Charlie's to all our friends and family who visit Scottsdale for Spring Training or otherwise.  Sadly, our most recent experience was downright tragic.  The following is not meant to dissuade anyone from visiting this restaurant.  It is only being provided to recount a bad experience that was not worthy of them.  If you prefer not to read on, know that we were finally taken care of by the manager (read on for more on this) who agreed that this was a True \"redo\" on their part.  On our way to the restaurant, we called them as we were going to be 5-10 minutes late for our reservation and didn't want them to think we were skipping out on our plans.  When we called, we were told that they didn't have the reservation we had made three weeks prior.  Luckily, though, we managed to get a table around 6:45.  Off to the bar!    At 7:00, our party was called and we headed to the hostess.  We were seated and perused the menu as we finished our drinks from the bar.  Our server stopped by to say, \"Be right back.\"  Our bread and toasted bagel slices came, we read the menu, our server stopped again to say, \"Be right back.\" A third time, he stopped to say he would be right back. Twenty minutes later, he came back; no name, no apology for the wait; just, \"can I get a drink order?\"  I replied, \"sure, but this has got to get better.  Please help us have a better experience ...\" I recounted our wait (not his fault, of course, but he did not communicate with us honestly or with any sense of care).  He barked back, \"It's very busy tonight, sir. We are backed up as you can see ... what do you want me to do?!\" At that point, I wanted him to get the manager.  A very pleasant young man appeared right away, saying he was the manager, visiting from another establishment.  He reiterated that they were busy tonight, which we all knew.  I asked him, \"why not tell us that up front instead of making us wait to get a table AND then making us wait for a server?\" He apologized again just saying how busy it was and asked if he could take our order.  The wine and food came out quickly and was cooked as we had requested.  We all ordered steaks, salads, and sides which were solid.  No problem at all with the food.  Dessert was offered and we asked for chocolate cake.  The manager brought out the cake and a Key Lime Pie.  He graciously offered the desserts on the house to make up for the earlier wait. Nicely done, we thought.  The bill came.  We slid two credit cards into the bill portfolio and waited.  Without a word, the server picked up the portfolio and came back in record time.  Unfortunately, only one card came back with him with the entire meal charged on it.  We asked him where the other card went.  He said that he only saw one and walked away.  We pulled out our cell phones and started looking for the card on the floor; no luck.  The hostess noticed us looking around and helped us look; again, no luck.  He had obviously flung the card out of the portfolio and onto the floor.  We asked for the manager, again.  We told him about the missing credit card.  He reaches into his back pocket and asks, \"Is this it?\"  Thankfully, it was.  He'd found it on the floor and was taking it to the hostess.    We all thought, \"let's just back out the charge on the other card and re-run the bill 50/50.\" Not so fast, though.  The server came out, insisting, \"that's just not how it works!\" The thing is, we all have significant experience in the restaurant business.  We know how it works. He just didn't want to be bothered - before, now or again with us - We just wanted the credit slip on the original charge and we would be on our way.  The server persisted, \"I can't do that ...\" Perhaps that was True. He either didn't know how or did not want to.  He became flustered and defensive, which was understandable considering his performance with our party that night.  As we were arguing with him, and just as he stormed off, the REAL manager came over to ask just what was going on at our table.  By this time, other guests were trying not to get too involved, but would later tell us they noticed what a hassle we went through ...  The (real) manager heard enough.  He rolled his eyes and agreed that something was just not right. He canceled/credited the entire bill and then charged us (basically) for the wine.  We'll take it.  Again, we knew this was a busy place.  We expected to wait.  But, how this experience went down and how we were treated by that server leaves us with a terrible taste that cannot be improved by the food.   For us, at least, please don't apologize for being busy.  If it's going to take extra time, tell us.  We will empathize if you're honest with us and we will surely complain if you're not.",

What we weren't impressed with was the food. The New York Strip steak was just OK, while the coconut shrimp was average. I enjoyed a glass of the house Pinot Noir and the banana cream pie was fresh, delicious and truly made at the restaurant daily. The twice baked potato is also worth the upgrade. In addition to the mediocre food, the place is long in the tooth, tight, has low ceilings and needs to be refreshed.",

There aren't many places in the world you can see autographed Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, and Mickey Mantle baseballs all next to each other. The entrance is lined with signed baseballs and memorabilia covers the walls and ceilings of the entire restaurant. During spring training you MUST make reservations to get in.   Overall the food is mediocre for the price. It is pretty expensive. My wife ordered a medium rare steak that was cooked to medium. She mentioned it and was quickly given a new one cooked correctly, and they even comped her order. That was some great service! We also had some Moscow mules, but they were very weak - id stay away from cocktails here. The employees are very friendly and we had a great waitress serving us and making the right amount of conversation. The largest group the restaurant will take is 8 and they won't seat you until everyone is present.   If you can, you should come here and see the amazing baseball history before it closes. Our waitress said it would close in May 2019.",

    "text": "There was a time when this place was our Go-To destination for steaks in Downtown Scottsdale.  A lot has changed this since. There are so many other options now; but Don & Charlie's still holds a place in our heart for being a good standard of delicious BBQ meats in the area.  We were celebrating another amazing Year-End and were looking forward to what 2017 had in store for our business; and we opted to dine here after being absent all these years.  For a weeknight, this place was still humming, and parking could've been dreadful; if it weren't for the availability of valet parking - which we always take advantage of when offered.  We were famished and didn't really waste any time ordering. Bring on the meat - as we emphatically stated!  For starters, we had the Tomato Bisque soup. This soup had an amazing consistency about it. It wasn't too tart, but not too watered down either. It could not have been any more perfect than this.  For the main course, we had the BBQ Chicken, the BBQ Beef Bone, and the Parmesan Crusted Sirloin. All fine examples of the large portions that you receive in this establishment.  And that is where I think we trail off in terms of opinions as far as the food here is concerned. Don & Charlie's always prided itself in the immensity of their portions. Their advertisements, and even word of mouth, regarding their portion sizes comes to mind.  The flavor of the food just doesn't quite distinguish themselves as much as they used to. The Chicken was light and moist, but the flavor was on the bland side. The Beef Bone was saturated in BBQ Sauce, but tasted overdone and the flavors were only skin deep.  The Sirloin was just okay, and the onion rings were soggy.  Don't get me wrong, it was still a good meal - and definitely still a good value. However, it just doesn't liven up the palate and senses like it used to.   However, the Creme Brulee with the Chocolate Center is still one of the best that we have tasted here in the valley.",

The food is over priced. A 10 oz prime rib is $39.99...really?It came cold, cooked to order. Expensive. The ribs were $24.99 for a half slab. They were hard to cut and just average.

    "text": "Shame on me for not writing a review sooner.  Dined here with three other friends during our Spring Training trip at the end of March. We had to make reservations about 2 months prior as well.  We arrived for our 6:30pm reservations and the place was packed! The bar was flowing, both dining areas were filled with people and the entry area was bustling.   As we waited for our table, Muhammed Ali walked in with his wife and family members. That was a huge highlight. This place is rich with sports memorbillia and players often eat here after a game. Only odd thing was our waitress told us after that the Brewers Manager was also dining in the next room and that we could walk over there if wanted to. I am a super fan of baseball, but even I know the limits of someone's personal space.   We each ordered a few appetizers, bottle of wine and some salads before our entrees. I ordered the 10 oz ribeye and it was delicous. We ordered a side of mac and cheese and it had lots of flavor.  This place is fun because of the sporting atmosphere, fans, players, coaches, etc. and it's walkable from Downtown Scottsdale.   I'd definitely go back here again next year. For all the ladies, this place is a must visit for some great eye candy.",

From the moment you walk in you are surrounded by baseball and other memorabilia.. bats, balls, pictures, overwhelming for my daughter.. famous for its baby back ribs, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Half rack was $18.95.. daughter had a burger, $11.95.. service xlnt. For me this is the best baseball themed restaurant anywhere.  We saw ex-Giants and current Reds manager Dusty Baker in the lobby.. nuts.. love this place. Place packed during March for baseball spring training in summer pretty dead..",

We were down in Arizona for Spring Training and had gone looking for great baseball eating places to go to after the games. We first went to Pink Pony and were disappointed. Then someone told us that D and C's was the new hotspot so we went there and was it ever great.  It was packed inside and the walls were filled with amazing baseball items and photos. Luckily, we were seated in the VIP corner booth right in the center of all the action. Then the Mom of the owner came up and started speaking to us, she was so nice and friendly, and eventually she sat down with us and spent much of the time of our meal with us in spite of all of the hubbub going on around us.  We got steaks and they were big and delicious. The potatoes were huge, the horseradish fresh and spicy hot. The entire night was terrific and the next time we return to Phoenix, we will probably go to D and C's every night because we know the food will be excellent and the service perfect.",

    "text": "My golf group decided to take me out to dinner as a reward for having them down to Scottsdale for our winter golf trip.  One of the guys wanted to go to Don and Charlie's so that's where we ended up. We got there fairly early on a Friday night, and were able to get right in.  We were seated in a large booth and given menu's but then seemed to lose our waitress.  It was busy at the time, so we weren't upset, but we wanted to order drinks.  We finally flagged the woman that sat us, and she located a server that took our order.  She then brought us our drinks, but was so busy with other tables, that she seemed to forget us for a while.   Apparently they had a special on their prime rib that ended at 6:00 pm, and everyone wanted to order before the magic hour was reached.  But so did we - and she made it just in time. But was she ever frazzled and curt.  The prime rib was wonderful, the baked potato was delicious, and the drinks were great.  I don't eat red meat that often, but I love it, and the prime rib and steaks were cooked just right - and the fresh horseradish was an extra treat.   It should be noted that by the time we finished there was a line waiting to get in.  They were swamped, but they did not seem in any hurry to rush us out and free up our table.  As sports fans, we all wandered around looking at the sports memorabilia during the time we were eating, so it took us a little longer to finish than usual.  They were patient and we did not feel rushed at all.  The only thing that detracted from the experience was the general commotion and noise of the crowd, and people waiting to get in.  It made it difficult to talk, so of course, we raised our voices.  And that just added to the din.  But all in all, it was a great experience.",

I asked for recomendations.....i ordered the dish my server said was very good . I had their chicken schnitzel , no flavor,  their potatoes, no flavor and the awful salad , a bowl of coleslaw -brown and vinagary. For the record I am a good cook, I use seasoning!

    "text": "Since work (if you consider covering spring training work!) brought my boyfriend and I to Scottsdale, it seemed appropriate that Don & Charlie's, this steak-filled, sports memorabilia mecca be on our list.   We had reservations for 7:45, but since we were starving, we thought we'd go at 7 to see if we could get a table a little early. No way, Jose Canseco (Sorry, I felt I had to make a baseball joke, albeit a bad one). Tt was packed - so there went that thought! (note to Yelpers, make a reservation) After the hostess told my boyfriend that he smelled \"delicious\", we decided to hit up the bar for a few drinks and admire the floor-to-ceiling memorabilia.   Time passed quickly and we were ushered to our table. We tentatively agreed to the chopped liver appetizer (complimentary) and while it didn't rock my world, it was free! We also ordered the shrimp cocktail, and for entrees, I ordered the mustard crusted salmon and he got the blue cheese crusted filet medallion tips. And because the experiences we've had at other steakhouses require you to order sides to share, we tacked on some mac n'cheese and sauteed mushrooms to our order. My eyes must've widened to the size of a 42 oz porterhouse when the waitress told us that our meal came with a few sides outside of the ones we ordered. Say what? Feeling a little overwhlemed, I downed my glass of wine and promptly ordered another. Nothing like a little alcohol-induced appetite to help you crush that much food.   The food came promptly and what ensued next was sheer enjoyment of a delicious meal of food. We honestly couldn't decide who had the better entree. But while it wass too tough to compare a fish to a steak, I still think mine sqeaked through as the True dinner champion. Definitely check this place out if you're in Scottsdale - especially if you're a sports fanatic. Just don't forget to make a reservation!",

EVERY single thing that I ate at Don & Charlies was A+  We ordered an appetizer of shrimp de Jonghe (sauteed in wine, topped with garlic bread crumbs) and it was perfect!  Best shrimp appetizer ever.  Then I ordered the rib & filet combo.  These ribs could rival anything you have ever had.  I did half char rubbed and half midwest sauce for the ribs.  The steak was cooked exactly as I asked which rules!  My buddy ordered the filet medallions and was super happy as well.  We ordered sides of potatoes au gratin and they were wonderful.  We also tried both cole slaw options and while we are not into cole slaw, this actually was super good!   I couldn't stop eating it.  Dessert was awesome - we just ordered simple hot fudge sundaes and the hot fudge is HOMEMADE - are you kidding me?!?!?!?!!  Amazing.  Drank the housemade lemonade as well and I loved it.  ANYTIME I am in Phoenix, I am headed here.  The memorabilia collection was so awesome and I plan to bring my friends and family here.  A+ location with A+ service.  We had Brittany as our waitress and she's awesome - so friendly and 100% on top of her game.  Amazing amazing amazing place.  You MUST visit!!!!!!",

    "text": "If you find yourself in downtown Scottsdale at lunchtime you might drop in at Don & Charlie's, the sports memorabilia paradise which incidentally serves really good steaks, chops and ribs. The main restaurant isn't open, but the lounge hosts The Burger Bar from 11:30 to 2:30 PM.   The menu is small. There are a few appetizers - guacamole (not the best in town) and a Cabo style shrimp cocktail ($6.95) which I've heard is quite good. A few salads - chicken   Caesar and Mediterranean with chicken, both $8.95. They looked tasty and were quite large. And a few uninspiring sounding sandwiches.  The real reason to come here is the burgers; big, juicy and cooked to order (even if the menu says differently). The basic burger is $7.95, and nine variations are listed (all $8.95), but you can create your own for the same price. Slaw is served alongside. But, get this, for $1.95 you can get a huge plate of delicious onion \"strings\". I don't know why they're called strings, which are often dry and overcooked. These are basically onion rings which have been cut open so they're not round (again, I have no idea why). Fries are the same price, or you can have half and half.  The other reason to go to The Burger Bar is the broasted chicken. This is half a chicken  deep-fried in a pressure cooker. According to the explanation on the menu, \"pressure frying seals in the flavors and seals out the oil\". Ken will attest to this. The chicken was nice and crispy, not greasy and not salty. And the price was right - $9.95 for a serving size that runs at least $16 almost anywhere else. A word of caution. The chicken isn't pre-cooked (thank heavens) so it takes 20 minutes to a half hour to reach your table.  There's a mini creme brulee ($1.95) for dessert. This lone little offering struck me as very funny.   While you're waiting for your chicken you can walk around and look for artifacts from you favorite team. It's a fun place and a most reasonable price for lunch.",

So when my other uncle flew down from San Francisco for spring training, we decided to see if he was really telling the truth.   The chopped liver appetizer tray was really good considering I've never had it nor was I even remotely interested by the sound of it.  I had a salad which was good (how can you really mess up a salad.)  Now I ordered the prime rib rare with fresh horseradish and a baked potato.  It was singlehandedly the best piece of red meat I've ever eaten.  Cooked to perfection (as was my wife's and uncle's steaks) just melted in my mouth like butter.  I've been to Fleming's, the Keg, and various other steakhouses, and they don't come close to this.  The horseradish was incredibly fresh with a lot more kick to it than normal.  The service was excellent with a very friendly staff.  The manager was more than helpful in trying to help us locate the picture of my uncle and his baseball team from Chicago.  He narrowed down the area for us and after 3 minutes of searching, low and behold, there it was.  19 years later the picture is still there.  I will go back, and not to visit the picture, but for the great food that awaits me.",

Things have gone downhill over the years. It seems as though you slowly raise the prices, and give you less and less items for the money. Yes I get it there is inflation, and you can't continue to give the same thing for the same price. But why are you the only restaurant I can think of, who constantly takes things away, and then charges more to add them back when it used to be included? Maybe you guys just were horrible at the beginning, and gave too much value? No, I don't think that was it. It's just that you are getting greedy.  There's no other way to put it.   But on to the dinner. Like many servers, our server clearly has been with your restaurant for many many years. And it shows. Not because she is so experienced, but because she seems to just be like a robot, rushing to take your order, not really hearing what you're saying, and not looking answer any extra questions. She simply want to move on, get the order in, get your food out, not stop by any extra times, get you out, and get the next warm bodies into the seat. What's frustrating is both the owner, & a manager are roaming around the dining room during our dinner, but neither one of them stop to ask him anything was. In fact I didn't even stop and talk to anyone in the dining room, not that I can't say it didn't happen, but I never saw it at all during our visit tonight.   You guys are an iconic restaurant in the valley, so you need to live up to your reputation, but instead you rest on your reputation and take advantage of your customers, many who spend up to $100 a person. I'm not saying you guys are in a good restaurant, I just think you need to remind your staff that the people who are dying in here are out to relax and enjoy the evening, and they should not be rushed through their meal, or be given any kind of attitude, or lack of customer service.   I hope you will stop and think, and remember it's the regulars who really build your business. If you slowly change everything, and disappoint, and don't respect them, you won't have much to show for it in the end now will you? Again, I think there's lots of good things about your restaurant , but I also think customer service is key, and this is not the first time I've not been impressed with it.   Your wait staff really needs to be reminded that they're lucky to have this position, and that regulars like us, as well as all customers, deserve better. Unless I see a change, my next visit may be my last.",

    "text": "The Boy took me to Don and Charlie's for my yearly anniversary of NOT getting older and we really enjoyed our experience!  Don and Charlie's has a lot of charm as that neighborhood restaurant where you take your family or meet your buddies after golf.  The menu is easy to navigate and reminded me of home (yay Midwest!). We decided on an appetizer, the onion strings, which was delicious and MASSIVE.  The two of us barely made a dent in it.    The Boy felt like ribs and I was feeling steak so he ordered a full rack with the Southwest Sauce and I got the NY with Parmesan crust.  The Boy LOVED the ribs and raved about the Southwest sauce so much that he has mentioned it several times since the visit and even talked about going back and seeing if he could buy a pint.  I ordered the Deli style cole slaw, a must if you like vinegar and mustard but was just ok with the Parm Crusted steak.  It was good but I felt like the steak had enough flavor that it didn't need the parm coating.  Our server was delightful, attentive, and very helpful when navigating the menu.  She even surprised me with a piece of their delicious chocolate cake for my birthday!  I mean, ummm, my special occasion.  Everything about our visit was amazing and we look forward to coming back!  One tip, use valet due to the many clubs in the area as well as the new residents being built across the street.",

The burger was nothing special (bun was dry). The wedge salad is the reason why they got another star - that I would order again & again. After ordering our food, the waitress promised to bring bread to the table but never did. As well it was very unprofessional when two waitresses started bickering & being petty towards each other in front of the customers.",

Surely they had to notice when they cut it to serve it! The wedge salad was lukewarm, and blue cheese dressing was \"interesting\" to say the least.  The ribs were overcooked and dry, the best part of the meal was the skin of the potato and The coleslaw. The draft beer was flat and we returned that.  Not sure what to expect if we had ordered one of the very expensive steaks... We will be not be going back.  Perhaps this restaurant is living solely on its reputation at this point. The sports memorabilia is fun to look at, but that's where the True enjoyment ends.",

Outside the restaurant as we were getting our car, a Man approached, who I assume was the manager, and said he could get us a table and we indicated no thanks since his staff should have been able to accommodate us if he could now.

We've dined in the restaurant area and the bar area.  If we want the full service treatment, we'll go in the restaurant....for quick eats, we go into the bar.  You can get the same menu at the bar as the restaurant, but not vice versa.  We've ordered the following:  Chopped Liver Platter (Sweet Bell Pepper Strips, Carrot Slaw, Onions, Chopped Egg, 4.95  Spinach & Artichoke Dip, 9.95  Cheeseburger, $10.95  12 oz Filet, $37.95  1/2 & 1/2 Cole Slaw, $2.50 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-and-charlies-scottsdale?select=1Ci3JFh8BI-pWVnAOzTxxw#1Ci3JFh8BI-pWVnAOzTxxw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/don-...</a>  Onion Strings, $4.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-and-charlies-scottsdale?select=abvoE3gWzuqV72x055JNug#abvoE3gWzuqV72x055JNug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/don-...</a>  The Filet & Cheeseburger are amazing and are my favorite.  I order one of these every visit.  The Better Half loves the Chopped Liver Platter....it's not for me though.  The Onion Strings are addictive...you've been warned.  I love how they offer a Cole Slaw side dish that's 1/2 Creamy and 1/2 Deli style....they're both good, but I give the nod to the Deli style if I had to choose only 1.  The service here is pretty good.  The only complaint that I have is that they never have any Ribs when we're here.  Our 1st trip, we came at 8:30 pm and the server told us that they were out of Ribs and that if we ever wanted to have them we'd have to come early like around 5:30 pm because they only order/prepare a limited amount....OK....so we came one day at 5:30 specifically to try the Ribs, guess what?  They were out already....WTF?!  Come on Don & Charlie....order enough to at least give us the opportunity to try this....I'm not going to play the game of come earlier next time.  That's the only bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended) about this joint.  Return Factor - 80%",

They are a solid 3 stars, and could be a 3.5 star is their food just wasn't so expensive. I don't mind paying higher prices when the food is on-par with the price, but Don and Charlie's is not a 4 or 5 star steakhouse, but their pricing says they are... It's hard to say what a 4 or 5 star steakhouse looks like because it's such a competitive space with some many variables such and inconsistent supply and staff to manage so that it is hard to be a solid 5 star to everyone every time.",

The reason for my 2 star review is as follows:  1.  Even with a reservation, you have to wait 30 minutes to get seated. 2.  They have increased their prices and decreased their portion sizes at the same time. 3.  The service is minimal, often having to remind your waiter/waitress to bring you what you had asked for. 4.  Prices are outrageous.  Dinner for two, with one drink each, has never been below $100.  We will be looking for other places to get a good steak from now on.",

Possibly because Willy Mays was there signing his book and other souvenirs. That was pretty surreal.   Once seated I checked in and was pleased you get a free cheesy bread appetizer with checkin. Definitely a plus.   The bread it came with wasn't that attractive. Also the bus boy grabbed my appetizer plate without asking so I had to tell him I wasn't done.  10 minutes after ordering the waitress came back and said she lost our ticket. Really? Hm ok. Too bad I reordered the first thing I ordered which was called \"mumsies stuffed chopped steak.\" I presumed it would be a stir fry but I clearly misunderstood because out came a pound slab of meatloaf. It was okay but I was miffed that I ordered just a hunk of ground beef with mashed potatoes on the side.   Also we finished our first round of drinks and she came back way later to check on us. The margarita was okay but we decided to keep it simple and get a bottle of wine to share instead.  I saw bench coach Ron wotus on the way in and clubhouse manager mike Murphy on the way out. Said hello to the latter. Anyway, the memorabilia was cool but the misleading menu and average wait staff brought the experience down for me. This place is a one and done for me.",

We made a reservation and we were sat about 15 minutes late. Then when getting seated they asked who's birthday is it? (I put a note in the reservation what we were celebrating) and I said it was his! We sat down and were greeted by our server who seemed to be overwhelmed with her night. We were in no rush and took our time ordering and getting drinks to start off with. We ordered our food and when it came out it looked great! Then once I cut into my steak that I ordered medium rare, it was well done. Thankfully his steak that he ordered medium rare was cooked to perfection. I tried to have a couple bites of mine but it was just way over cooked. Our server never once came by to ask how everything was and just asked if I wanted a box at the end. You would think that if I was paying that much for a meal and took a couple bites they would ask if everything was okay. Then at the end we were never asked if we wanted to get dessert! And our server never acknowledged his birthday! Why ask if we are celebrating something and then never acknowledge it??",

My girlfriend has been coming here since she was a kid and I was lucky enough to be invited along for the past year or so. Since my first experience (I had ribs which weren't bad but weren't 5 star worthy) the food quality has only gone up for me. The parmesan crusted New York strip was to die for. Best coleslaw I think I have ever had and the au gratin potatoes are always delicious.   Perhaps I just don't know where to go but it seems like old school places like this don't really exist much anymore. After all, I am old at heart. It was a non pretentious spot for family gatherings or date nights where you wanted to have a nice steak but not feel like you had to dress up in club attire. Reasonable prices for the quality and portion sizes too.   You'll be missed Don & Charlies. Our farewell dinner was as perfect as it could be. Perfect food and perfect service. I'm glad I got to visit you several times before the end. If you haven't made it back for a farewell, the time is NOW!",

    "text": "D&C is a classic sports memorabilia steakhouse.  As Spring Training is in the Greater Phoenix region, you have a good chance of running into athletes and this place, you'll see the most evidence of why.  It's a classic old looking dimly lit place but with all sorts of baseball and sports artifacts.  Photos of Muhammad Ali who visited here. Autographed Babe Ruth baseball. Classic bobbleheads (the Bob Ueker one was my favorite) Jerseys everywhere.  Trevor Story and Nolan Arenado's are displayed in the main dining area.  To me it was information overload and there was no real methodology as to how they were all laid out.  Just a ton of artifacts everywhere.  Service was perfect.  That's all that needs to be said about that.  Food was 3-3.5 star quality.  It's good but I've had better ribs and prime ribs (which were what I ate).  The ambience is a 4.5 if you love sports.  I love sports so I enjoyed it here.  It's a very social friendly place.  It's moderately loud but you can carry on a very good conversation amid a large round table holding 8 persons.  The fries here are outstanding.  I recommend the larger looking fries.  They were perfect.  5 star quality fries there.  The \"Deli style\" cole slaw side (3 stars) was too sweet in my opinion.  The creamy (4 starts) one tastes much better.  The ribs I didn't like (3 stars).  Too burnt and hard to eat.  They warned me in advance but I had to at least give them a try.  The prime rib is much better (4 stars)  The mashed potatoes ( 3 stars) taste pretty good with the prime rib's gravy poured on it.  But they're too dry.  For a decent dinner, you will have to pay around $40-$60 after tip.  Also, this place permanently shuts down early this coming April so this review won't be too useful considering you need a month in advance to make a reservation here.  Was an interesting experience.  I recommend it once because of the artifacts and the history of this place, but you'll find better steakhouses elsewhere without all the hype.",

No matter what, that space will not be replicated and that is sad.  The ribs, the baked potato, the salads, and the Gold Brick Sundae are half of what makes the place great. The camaraderie of all the diners, the great staff, and wonderful memorabilia are part of the fabric of America's past time.  It is one of my must eat places in the world more than for the food, but for the experience.  If they come back, even if half as wonderful, I will say it isn't the same, but is and always be a place to go to.  I hope the boutique hotel will pay homage to the restaurant even if it isn't the same.  I have so many memories of this place and have met and sat next to so many famous people.  My favorite is having busted out of work and flown to down to 'Zona for a guys weekend of baseball and golf.  We were exhausted but when we got to the restaurant the doors burst open and it was the Giants broadcasting team of Kruk, Kuip, and Simmons. Kruk held the door open and said \"Gentlemen, welcome to Baseball Heaven\".  Thanks Don and Charlies, as Lon Simmons used to say, \"Going, going, ........ Tell it goodbye.\" You established something great and memorable in this world that brought people joy.",

Steaks, ribs, etc. The usual classic steak house sides. All solid with a good drink and wine menu. The thing for me is the memorabilia. I mean words cannot describe it. Wall to ceiling. Hall of fame stuff. Babe Ruth signed baseball sitting next to Ted William's. I mean awesome. Go for the love of the game and get a great meal while your at it. Sad to see this place go but glad I got in here just once. No other place like it in the world.",

Maybe it's all their collectibles in display cases as you come in, but it reminds me of my first trip to Gene & Georgetti's thirty plus years ago.   The five of us came here for our Easter dinner and for the most part we left impressed. The food was very good and cooked to perfection. Our server Jeff was incredible. I'm going to write that again, our server Jeff was incredible!  Steakhouse are not inexpensive dining, but Don & Charlie's prices are in-line with some of the others here in town, like Paul Martin's, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, etcetera. But what you are really getting at Don & Charlie's, besides a good tasting steak, is atmosphere. Don & Charlie's has atmosphere in spades.   I've taken a few photos and yes, the food was as good as it looks. Expect to pay $65 each, including dessert, one drink and taxes, but before gratuities.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "Very popular and a staple of Scottsdale, you can expect to run into one or more athletes over dinner.   Valet and street parking available.  Many sports memorabilia decorate every square inch of the restaurant. Large, busy bar and lots of seating for small and larger groups. Sufficient beer and wine selection. Steaks are cooked perfectly, and they are famous for their ribs. The New York steak was cooked right at medium rare and came with a crusty, wonderfully delicious crust. Salad and broccoli are a strong pass, the salads probably super high in calorie with their dense sauces and the broccoli being very bland and with a tangy sauce that didn't look appealing both visually or taste-wise. Potatoes, whether roasted or mash, seemed visually more tasty and a better option.  Not a five star because our server didn't seem too excited when we ordered desserts, and even mentioned it would be more preferrable to turn the table around for a new set of customers but would make an exception for us to order dessert.  There's a rumor the store is closing and being converted to a nursing facility or senior housing with the restaurant perhaps or not moving to another location. Hope that's not True as even if they simply relocated, it would not be the same. A jem and old school tradition that needs to stay.",

I cannot recall how many years we have been coming here. My daughter always wanted dinner at D&C's for her birthday, presents were not required as long as we took her to dinner here. We always order a full rack of baby back ribs because they are so good, meaty and tasty without having to be dripping with sauce.  There was a method to our madness on this night. We were going to order a rack to take home, alas our waitress, Maggie told us that they were not doing to go orders on the last nights. So....I asked if I could go ahead and order extra dinners and she said this was fine! So I ordered 2 racks of ribs and just got a doggie bag for the extra set. My wife ordered the 12oz Filet Mignon, medium rare. It came out looking so delicious, I begged for a bite, amazing! We also always get the creamed spinach which we also got as extra orders. I love their creamy coleslaw and got an extra order. Our table looked to be overflowing as platters we all over, it looked great. Don was walking around greeting everyone one this, one of the final nights at this great location. He is such a gentleman. We will miss this great establishment. Even though they are to open and scaled down version when the hotel is built, it will not be the same. Thanks to Don and Charlie's for many great memories and so many great meals.",

Honestly, I thought why even try Don & Charlie's. It can't be better than City Hall or Steak 44 (I'm not a fan of Bourbon and Bones). I'm so glad I gave it a try.   My wife had the steak sandwich, which isn't a sandwich at all. It's a NY Strip with a side of cheese bread. She loved it. I had the ribeye and it literally melted in my mouth. The best ribeye I've had in Old Town. I really liked the coleslaw and the original sauce as well. The banana cream pie was delicious.  I'm so glad I came here before the shut it down before the rebuild. We will be coming here from now on when we have a steak craving.",

    "text": "Don and Charlie's was interesting. It's a steakhouse meets sports bar type of place. We came here for a celebratory dinner for my sister after she graduated from college. We made a reservation for 7:45pm. I checked out the menu beforehand and based on the pricing, I envisioned this place to be pretty upscale. I was surprised when I walked in that the whole place is littered with sports memorabilia. It's on the walls, ceiling, everywhere. It's pretty cool to look at but not what I imagined at all. It was very quiet on a Monday night and only a handful of tables were occupied. Our server was sweet and efficient. And so was the bus boy who cleared plates and filled water.   Shortly after we sat down, bread, bagel chips and butter were brought to the table. I love that the butter was room temp so it was easy to spread. We ordered shortly after and the food came out about 20 minutes after that.   Out of 7 of us, 3 people got ribs, 3 got steaks and one salmon. The Parmesan crusted NY which I ordered was delicious. It was cooked medium as I requested. The Parmesan crust fell off the steak so that was a slight annoyance but still tasty. Each entree comes with coleslaw creamy or vinegar style, and a choice of potato. The coleslaw was delicious. It was cold and tangy. The mashed potatoes were ok as well as the fries.   Minor gripes.  My bro ordered the \"steak sandwich\" which is literally just a piece of steak and cheese toast on the side. The waitress warned him that this was not what you think a sandwich would be, and she was not wrong. But my thing is why would you even call it a sandwich then? Also it came out very burnt. My bro didn't want to complain but I would have said something. Also the ranch although homemade, was SO SALTY. I could barely eat it. And you know I love my ranch.  I hear this place is closing soon because it got bought out by a hotel or something. But I think it will be open for another year or so.",

It was Sunday and they didn't even have any of the special left at 5:30 PM.  The person I was with said the prime rib was very good.  Another person said the chicken ceasar salad was good as well.  I did hear a resounding 'YUM' regarding the mashed potatoes.  For what they charge here, I would not be compelled to go back nor would I recommend.",

Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips.   Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous.  We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training.",

Sat down and a gentleman came up and started a conversation with us.  Come to find out that this was another friendly patron who was there by himself.  Just needed someone to talk to.  Almost everyone in the restaurant was in a good mood.  Lots of autographed and sports memoribilia.  Found out that the owner's family owned Carson's Ribs: a Chicago staple.  So of course had to have the ribs.  They were fantastic.  Get the vinigar cole saw.  Out of this world.",

    "text": "5 visits to Don & Charlie's and I can form an opinion finally. Well, thats not all True, I had a good opinion formed after the first visit but kept coming back because everyone sang such high praises. In all honesty, I have to wonder about the people singing praises of this place. Are they the same people that think TGI Friday's is a nice night out? Red Lobster is good seafood? A phenomenal upscale night out is Cheesecake Factory? They must be.... MUST BE.  Now before you all go screaming how you are insulted because you like Don & Charlie's, hear me out. They are part of a chain of 35 restaurants called Lettuce Entertain You, cute. The other Phoenix location they own is Maggiano's Little Italy, which is always forgetful. From the moment you walk in and are coldly greeted by a teenage girl, who is only there because daddy wants her to have a job to prove she is mature enough to drive the BMW he just bought her for sweet 16, one has to wonder what they are in for. Is this going to be a fun-filled evening with wacky sports memorabilia all over the walls and fun servers? Are you going to be taken into the wacky world of Chicago/Phoenix sports history? Are you in for the best BBQ you've ever had? Hardly.  Despite warnings from a co-worker whom had been prior to my visit that said the tough and dry ribs won't come off the bone despite any efforts you make, I ordered them. He was right. With me done trying to separate the meat from the bone, and giving up, I put the bone down, still covered in meat. The ribs came with a chicken schnitzel that had pretty much zero flavor, at all. Next visit dad and I both ordered Prime Rib, ate about 2/3 of it and both agreed that eating the rest just wouldn't be worth it. Another visit we ordered a shrimp cocktail, a couple of steaks, wedge salads, calamari, and a few other odds and ends. The 4 of us that night spent quite some time in the bathroom at our respective homes.   The service has never been really friendly, to say the least, but usually spot on helpful. On my 5 visits, I've had 3 different servers. One, a large middle aged gentleman, is the most matter of fact guy I've probably ever encountered. Just not the personality for a server and while I understand where he is coming from, my guests thought he was downright rude. Another, an older woman, likes to slam stuff onto your table, without saying a word. I'm sorry, I expect you to be nice to me. Maybe you could be more like the *runners* at Applebee's and tell me what you are putting in front of me and ask me if I want anything else. Sad that you don't even stack up to a food runner at Applebee's, a place that I'll never give an endorsement to. Stop giving me the cold shoulder. I'm not your enemy, in fact we have never met.  I understand Don & Charlie's for what it is. It is a restaurant that appeals to two crowds. One crowd is the elderly who want blander foods because they don't like the spices. I can understand that, and it's only fair they have a place to go. They go here because they know what they are going to get, have a great choice of early-bird specials, and will never get indigestion from spices. Old people tend to be incontinent anyhow, so they are likely to not notice the diarrhea they get afterward. The second group is tourists/people hosting tourists who go for the kitschy sports atmosphere, and accept that the food is less than average and or don't really care. Maybe some of these people aren't interested in quality and just think food is food. I have a buddy who swears it is the best steakhouse in town. He is also the same guy who eats Taco Bell, Applebee's, Outback, Etc. on a regular basis because they are the best places in town. There is something to be said for people with no taste buds, they are way easy to please!",

Our great waitress Haley..... promptly  took drink orders and made sure we received our first visit/complementary Parmesan toast. The menu was traditional steakhouse and didn't disappoint. Wedge salad.....Parmesan NY strip and blue cheese fillet mignon medallions along with creamed spinach were A-1. Bring your appetite to this place....... It compares to the top east coast steak spots. The topper was the birthday sundae. Two candles..... low key and just right to finish the evening. If you're in Scottsdale and a hungry baseball fan.......you have to hit Don and Charlie's......

Wow, how exciting to walk into a place that models itself after places I grew up with.  The ambiance is second to none - the Chicago sports memorabilia is worth millions.  Totally what I had hoped.  Sadly, we caught Don & Charlies at the worst possible time ever.  Our reservation apparently happened just moments after the ASU football team showed up.  It was by far the worst service I have experienced in a long time.  One of my kids fell asleep waiting for his mac and cheese.  And I couldn't get a drink to save my life.  We sent back two of seven meals - and we are not the fussy food type.   I would give this restaurant a single star (because I am a sucker for Chicago memorabilia), but, I give it a second star because the manager was amazing - taking care of us even better than I could have hoped.  He was obviously embarrassed and apologetic.  I will try it again and hope the other reviewers got it right.   But, couldn't justify more than a couple of stars for tonight's dinner (I didn't eat).",

This famed spring training hangout is not just for the snowbirds or baseball fans in the spring. I have had some of the best meals during the summer season when the hype of spring training has faded.   Amongst the vast collection of baseball memorabilia is a great steakhouse. I have had a lot of fantastic meals and a few not so fantastic meals. Bottom line is that if something wasn't prepared to my liking the management and staff have been trained to please the customer. For that reason I will be a lifelong patron at Don & Charlies! Don Carson and his staff have hit a \"grand slam!\"",

VERY GOOD.. highly recommend.  Second course, ordered the cole slaw.  Saw they had a section and the menu and was intrigued.  They serve it before the meal like soup or salad.  I like coleslaw that was also VERY GOOD.  Nice taste of onions in it.  Main course was the \"George Will\", NY Strip with fresh garlic and a side of the Au gratin pototoes.  Ordered steak medium rare and came out medium or better.  Said something to waitress... boom... it was gone and new one was back in 5 minutes.... medium rare.  Very Good steak!  However, I was a little jealous of my some of my friends choices.  One ordered the bone in ribeye...charred on the outside and medium rate in center.  AWESOME.  Another friend ordered the mash potatoes.   I like mashed and these are very good.  Creamy.. not chunky.   No room for desert.  Spent about $70 for dinner including a couple of drinks.  Well worth the money.  I wish I could have spent more time looking around.",

    "text": "Just mention the name of this restaurant and my hunny immediately starts making noises of pleasure. NOM NOM NOM he says. He loves this place. I have been eating here since the 80's. It hasn't changed much. Baseball & sports decor literally covers every square inch of wall. Still inviting and comfortable. The menu hasn't changed much either. Ribs, steak, prime rib and a few comfort foods. I always say I am going to order something other than ribs next time I go, but I just can't get past the deliciousness of their ribs. I always order the char.             This last visit started like any other. My hunny was having a birthday and he wanted  Don & Charlie's. I invited my sister and her husband and we went on a Weds night.  They can be very busy any night of the week, but we had reservations, so getting a table wasn't a problem. We were seated right away. We ordered drinks and I was disappointed to learn that they no longer served the complimentary chopped liver. After decades of being free, it is now on the appetizer menu. I know alot of you are thinking \"liver, eww!\", but it was one of the things I loved about the place. I went ahead and ordered it while everyone decided on meals. Our side of the table was a no brainer - RIBS. It was my sister and BIL's first visit, so they took a bit longer. They settled on a small filet for my sister and the larger filet for my BIL. He added the shrimp appetizer to his steak for a surf & turf. As we all wanted salad, we had to add that to the order. Last year they stopped serving salads with the meal and made them an additional cost. You can have cole slaw for free, but it's just not the same. There is nothing special about the side salad to warrant charging for it over the slaw. Their blue cheese dressing is exceptionally good tho. My appetizer came and my BIL and I shared it while we waited for the salads. After apps & salad we got our meals. Service had been uncharacteristically lax up to this point. Drink refills and such were slow in coming and more than once we had to get someone to find our server for us. The ribs were delicious as usual. My sister's filet was overcooked and needed to be sent back. It was returned to the kitchen with her sides as well as the mushrooms she had ordered. It was sent back without the sides or mushrooms she was paying another additional fee for. We had to ask the manager for her sides. He very graciously brought them out and apologized for the lack of them. My sister still wasn't happy with the steak. It was rare as she preferred, but there was no color to the exterior. She ate half of it and then cut the rest into small pieces for her dogs. Yes I know GASP! My BIL enjoyed his steak & shrimp. The appetizer he had added to his steak was excellent and went very well with it. They should consider making it an option!           As with most dinners, I could not finish mine. I had only eaten 1/3 of the rack and I asked to have it boxed. I learned later that the server had tossed everything on my plate into one box. Normally this isn't so bad, but at Don & Charlie's, the baked potatoes are covered on the outside with coarse salt & pepper for baking. The result was that my leftover ribs were far to salty to enjoy and ended up being thrown out.     We ordered dessert and then waited for the check. The server had failed to seperate the checks as requested, so we had to wait while she re-did them. She brought them out and they still weren't accurate, but we didn't want to wait any longer for it. She told us that they had a new system that she hadn't figured out yet. We went ahead and paid. Debit card for us, cash from my BIL. We discussed the tip. Normally when eating here, the service is excellent. This night I think our server had other plans because she definitely had her mind somewhere away from our table. We ended up leaving 15%, which still amounted to about a $30 tip. My sister was very disappointed and has said she won't go back. I tried to explain to her that normally everything is much better, but she is stubborn. Later we learned that the server had swiped our debit for both meals. After several phone calls and conversations with management, it was resolved. They were very apologetic about the service that night and made sure the debit was voided. They mailed us confirmation of the void as well as complimentary certificates for dinner. They wanted to make sure all was well.     This is the first real issue we have ever had here. After 30 or so years of dining here, I'd say one bad night is allowed. We would be going back for dinner whether we had the certificates or not.",

It was crazy busy when we went on Saturday (mainly bc it's spring training and they are big supporters of the Giants). We didn't stay to have drinks but we got to walk around (food looked great from what I saw on people's tables as I tried to squeeze in to see the autographed baseballs).   We were really lucky this weekend when we got there, because Willie Mays was there doing a charity autograph signing, and we were also able to get right next to the Giant's world series championship trophy on its traveling tour. The two women who were guarding it were really nice, and let us take pics with it and look at it up close. We just couldn't touch it, which is fine.   I want to come back here during non-Spring Training season, because it was way too packed over the weekend, and it looked like it would take 2hrs to get seated to eat.",

The complimentary chopped liver with an assortment of breads and chopped egg and onion was a great start.

    "text": "I don't eat red meat so Don and Charlie's isn't a place I would normally find myself going to. I went Friday night for a friend's surprise 30th birthday dinner with a group of about 15. Our table was set up and waiting once the birthday guy arrived, so that was nice. As other reviews have mentioned, this place is covered in sports memorabilia and framed Sports Illustrated magazine covers. I felt like I should be in a sports bar, but nope, I was in a steakhouse. Also, my group was the youngest in the restaurant by about 25 years until a rowdy bachelor party showed up (we had 6:30 reservations).  Our group was split between two tables that were next to each other and each table had a different waiter. My table definitely got the short end of the stick. A friend's girlfriend really wanted a grilled cheese kid's meal (no clue why)...when she ordered it the waitress started yelling at her and told her no she couldn't have it. She only agreed to ask a manager when the girl started crying (which is a whole other issue in and of itself). I've never ever seen a restaurant give an adult a hard time about ordering a kid's meal. It wasn't like the rest of the table wasn't ordering full meals. Strike 1.  The food itself was mediocre. I had the cobb salad which was fine, but some pieces of the chicken in the salad didn't look cooked all the way, so I pretty much avoided eating most of the chicken. Three friends at my table had the ribs which none of them really seemed to enjoy. My husband had a caesar salad starter (I took a few bites and there was way too much dressing on it); the ribeye for a meal (he said it was just OK), and garlic mashed potatoes as a side, which we shared. Yuck. They had almost no flavor and congealed pretty quickly. Strike 2.  After the food came our waitress was pretty much MIA and never asked if any of us wanted another drink. We couldn't even find her to order another drink. The table that had the other waiter had the same complaint that after the meals were delivered, he never asked if anyone wanted another drink. Strike 3.  Overall, I was pretty disappointed in my dining experience at Don and Charlie's. My friend's mom paid for everyone's meals (sooo nice), so we didn't pay for our dinner so I know I shouldn't complain too much. My friend was quite shocked by the surprise dinner and I was among good company, so I'll be nice and round a 2.5 star experience up to 3.",

    "text": "Update 5/7/08--- I had no choice but to bump this down to 2 stars.  While it was nice, again, to be on the winning side of the day's golf and therefore receiving a free meal I didn't walk out feeling like a winner.  The service is still very attentive and the place is cool to see but the food is at best average.  The cuts of meat were marginal, not bad but nothing special at all, and were cooked inconsistently and not always to order.  In general it just came across as a novelty experience - lots of sports memorabilia eye candy with food as a secondary consideration.  We were a big group last year and an even bigger one this year but I'm pretty sure there won't be a next year for us at D&C.  First posted 5/14/07--- This is a 3.5 star rating.  At times I find myself adding points for one aspect only to deduct some for an entirely different reason.  I guess that makes this place a bit of an enigma to me.  I am left thinking of it as a classic throwback blue-collar sports bar B.B.Q.-joint diner steakhouse with an interesting atmosphere.  I was in the Scottsdale area as part of a group of 12 guys on an annual golf outing and this was the third and final dinner of the trip and served as the high priced ($40/guy) loss for the losing team (of which I unfortunately was a member).  The food was good - they definitely know how to cook meat.  I had the 12 oz. filet and it was cooked exactly as the waitress described medium rare - pink and warm in the middle.  The guys sitting on either side of me each ordered different steaks cooked to different levels and both seemed equally satisfied.  I also really enjoyed my iceberg wedge salad - it was huge and fresh - but that shouldn't be hard to get right.  My double baked potato was fine and desserts were at best average.  I had the flourless chocolate cake which was fine but the banana cream pie was essentially whipped cream on top of banana pudding.  The atmosphere was not exactly what I expected although I didn't really know what to expect.  When I think 'steakhouse' I think two things.  First is a somewhat dark dining area with booths and a sort of intimate feel to it and second is a menu that features various steak/prime rib cuts along with token chicken, fish and pasta selections.  Don & Charlie's is none of this.  Then again it is not strictly a steakhouse.  The dining area is essentially one big, brightly lit room with no booths and a fairly loud din.  It, along with virtually every part of the building, is covered with sports memorabilia.  The menu is broad enough that you actually have to look for the steak section.  Being there for the reason I was made these variances a positive to me but on other occasions they could just as easily have been a negative  Random notes:  The service was great in a very straightforward way.  With such a large group it is almost inevitable that when the food comes out there is some confusion about who ordered what.  But we experienced none of that.  People were served what they ordered and without any chaos.  Bud Selig, of \"Chopped Steak a la Bud Selig\" fame, or is it Commissioner of MLB fame, was there.  Valet parking at $5 was expensive and an out of place option given the rest of the experience.  The main thing that made me round down to 3 stars was the price.  It's just too expensive for what you get.  I didn't see the final bill but it must have been $45+/guy without drinks.  I have no problem paying that kind of money for a meal but I have had many better meals for that kind of money.  It was fun to see the sports stuff but ultimately it is about the dining experience and, on the whole, for the price it really was average.",

But my adventures in Phoenix didn't end there.   My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great \"Q.\" He was convinced that AZ would have great \"Q\" on every corner. Now referring back to the link above, I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time. Anyway, I'll press on. We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot.   I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died (most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before) and was now in heaven. This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted. Of course I'm in heaven and BGF is grousing about the \"Q\" not being any good.   Now I've listened to this all week from him.   - This Q is too Spicy  - This Q is too wet  - This Q won't fall off the bone  - This Q doesn't have the right flavor.   I'll admit it, I snapped. (And I didn't forgive him for about 2 weeks). I went up one side and down the other. If you don't like the gosh darn (loosely translated) Q in AZ, the quit ordering the Blankity Blank (translation again) stuff. Needless to say, I got quite the look from BGF and boss. Boss was actually laughing at us.   Anyway, I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken, and he fell in love (I don't know why, it wasn't a rooster - oops, I digress). Anyway, it was decided then and there, this is the best chicken around, hands down.",

    "text": "This is far and away my favorite steakhouse in Phoenix.  I have eaten here dozens of times with my wife, my friends, my family and even a private function I scheduled here for my sales force at our National Sales Conference.  This is my first stop with guests from out of town, and the restaurant has never done anything but exceed expectations.  The prices are far less than many of the \"elite\" steakhouses in town, and the steaks are on par or better.  The service is impeccable.  I always request Donna, a server who has been there for many years and is a True professonal.  She knows the menu and knows her customers.  The staff goes out of their way to make you feel at home.  One of the many things that I love about D&C's is the fact that they still give you a full meal with your steak.  Salad, potato and usually onion strings are all standard with the price of the steak.  You also receive a plate of chopped liver and home-made bagel chips at your table.  How refreshing in a world where salads are now $9 extras and sides are all ala carte at \"top\" steakhouses.  My personal favorite is the bone-in ribeye, and when ordering beef at D&C's, you should always request the char-crust.  The smoky, blackened crust is a unique touch, and when topped with a roquefort butter (you also need to request this), I really dont think it can be beat.  I've had a few other entrees, but I will never order anything other than this steak again.  The others were all good, but the ribeye is in a league of its own.  Some extra add-ons that you may want to try (although you really dont need them) are the Shrimp DeJonge (like a scampi but far better), baked onion soup, and creamy cole slaw.  I am serious - order the creamy cole slaw, just to try it.  It's fantastic.  The creamed spinach is also very unique.  It's not like traditional creamed spinach, more of a gratin with gooey strings of cheese.  We get it every time - I think it's about $4.  Last, what more can you say about the memorabilia on the walls?  If you love sports, this is your church.  I still take the time to wander around and always find something new.  Very rarely have I eaten here and not been in the presence of some sort of sports celebrity.  Bud Selig, Mike D'Antoni and Willie Mays, just to name a few.  During spring training, it will be hectic and you need to expect that.  This may be the most popular restaurant in Phoenix in the month of March.  Make reservations far in advance and you will be glad you did.",

    "text": "I must preface this review by saying that normally I only review a place when I can I rave about it positively.  My experience at Don and Charlie's was so horrible, I feel an obligation to warn people about going there.  My family and I have dined at Don and Charlie's a few times in the past when visiting AZ, after our latest experience, we will never return.  We were used to the crowded atmosphere and the wait (even if you make a reservation) but the service was completely unacceptable.  I have gotten better service at a Taco Bell.  First, the waitress asked us for our drink orders before we had even sat down.  When my mother-in-law asked to see the wine menu first and asked for a minute, the waitress huffed, rolled her eyes and walked away. When she returned, my father-in-law couldn't hear the waitress (it is quite loud in the restaurant, which is fine) but her response was to roll her eyes in his face and yell back her response.  Unacceptable.  My mother-in-law wanted to hear more about the two different kinds of cole slaw (which is a Don and Charlie's specialty and I would assume the wait staff would be prepared to respond), but the waitress told her to read the menu.  While we were eating dinner, another waiter spilled a beer on my mother-in-law's jacket and then ran away before she could stop him.  So rude.  Finally, we had finished dinner and sat forever before the waitress brought our bill.  Literally, we sat there with a cleared table for 15 minutes.  Then she brought the bill and had included extra charges which my husband questioned - no surprise, she rolled her eyes and walked away with no explanation.  She then came back and had adjusted our bill to reflect what we had ordered.  We were totally disappointed with how the waitress treated us.  Even though the food was fine, it was the WORST dinner experience we had during our trip.  If you are visiting AZ for spring training, I would recommend going someplace else, like Cafe Monarch, Houstons, Bandera or anyplace but here.",

While they were accommodating in making replacement suggestions that's not what we were there for. Even though the food was very good and the service excellent. Come on Don or Charlie, get with the program!!!",

    "text": "We went there to celebrate my mom's 80th birthday because that's where she wanted to eat. There were seven of us, and when reservations were made we informed them it was her birthday. I had the 24 oz. bone in ribeye cooked medium rare with char-crust. It was cooked just right and came with onion rings (greasy) on top. Had I known I'd have told them to leave them in the kitchen. Not what I expected on a $50.00 steak. My wife ordered the fried (formerly broasted) chicken. It was a small leg, a small thigh and one other piece which seemed to be fried, not roasted as the waitress stated. For the $18.00 you could get almost four roasted chickens that taste better at Costco. If they wanted to serve chicken and charge a higher price they could have made it tastier. At each table there was a basket of bread, but we received none at ours. It didn't dawn on us until we were done, so we didn't request any. The waitress we had seemed to be unfriendly and we felt rushed. The unfriendliness persisted throughout the meal. When we left my wife and sister voiced their complaints to the hostess, who agreed that we should have been given a basket of bread. She claimed that the restaurant had recently served some 800 people because it was Spring Training, and that they needed to slow down now that it wasn't so busy. With tip we laid out right around $300.00 and will not be returning. It's difficult to park there, and they offer valet parking at $5.00 with a sign that explains that the $5.00 does not include a tip. Thanks but no thanks.",

My only critique is the server had almost no knowledge on the wine list or scotches on hand. It is definitely worth the visit.  All those reviews whining about the Willie Mays thing are ridiculous, don't give two stars because Say Hey wouldn't sign your kids baseball, he is there for charity not just to sign stuff for one time visitors. Review the place based on its food quality...which is at least a 4 in itself!",

Now the food is not as good as it used to be. Also, the servers ask if you want to upgrade to this or that. A salad is an \"upgrade.\" The chopped liver must be purchased as an appetizer.  When you go to a restaurant, you should not be asked if you want to upgrade as if your going from coach to first class, unless of course, it wants the customer to perceive its food as Coach class or average. The restaurant needs to change the way it talks to the customers and get back to serving quality food like they used to.  No one needs to go to a restaurant and be forced to choose between and an expensive meal that is average and a more expensive meal that is a little better than average. The management has taken the joy of dining out at Don and Charlies.",

I wanted something classy, that was not full of families (aka - small kids) but not too fancy. Don and Charlie's was perfect. Just the right combination of class, style, and tastefulness. Not so quiet that it's awkward, but not too loud that it's annoying. I had the 16 oz New York strip  George Will's style (garlic on top) and it was absolutely amazing. The sports memorabilia is really cool too. I recommend this place to anyone.",

I sat across from my wife and our table had a round base so I couldn't scoot my chair forward.  I had to lean in to talk to her the entire night.  The lighting is poorly set up.  The shadow from my head made it very difficult to read the menu or see my food in any detail.  Tables were pushed close together so that other parties conversations were somewhat invasive, despite not being terribly crowded.  The sports memorabilia everywhere is kind of cool, but seems out of place with the dim lighting and expensive pricing.  Food: ok.  Nothing special.  My wife had the prime rib and I had the BBQ chicken.  Quite honestly, we would have been more satisfied at Applebee's or Chili's.  Price: Very high, especially for what you get.  Not to mention that some of the sides aren't really included in your meal price.  We paid $70 (after tip) for a bad steak, ok chicken, coleslaw, fries, a salad and one soda.  That's it.  Very disappointed.  Service: Poor.  I get that my wife and I weren't big spenders (no alcohol, etc.) but we still felt as though we were heavily ignored.  The waiter would be at other tables two or three times as much as ours.  The waiter and bus staff seemed overwhelmed.  Overall - NOT RECOMMENDED.  Unless you want to pay way too much for just ok food, pass on Don & Charlie's.  I would take the money and cook a nice meal at home, or go to Outback (better prices, service and food) and spend the extra on a movie or something.",

They start taking reservations on their website a month in advance for this time of year, and there's a reason for that. It is very, very popular. We had a reservation for 8:15pm on a Thursday night in March. We arrived about a 1/2 hour before our reservation, and when I checked in, the hostess said our table would be ready around the time of our reservation. Not a problem. We went to the bar, got drinks, and then wandered around & looked/took pictures of all the incredible sports memorabilia on the walls/ceilings. The place is incredible. The food: fantastic! If you check-in on Yelp, they've got an offer for a free onion strings or garlic cheese toast appetizer. My boyfriend go the prime rib & I got the ribs (\"Don's way\"). We both loved our selections. The ribs weren't fall-off-the-bone type ribs, but they were fantastic. I loved that there wasn't too much sauce.  The tables are pretty close together in the restaurant because they try to use as much space as possible. This ended up being great for us though because we met two awesome men who were on their 24th Spring Training trip together. They were very enjoyable to talk to & I'm really glad we decided to talk to them. They've been coming to Don & Charlie's since the very beginning, and we hope to make it a tradition as well!",

But you have to get the twice baked cheddar potato. Is it worth it you ask? Well...let's just say we had to order a SECOND one because it was mind blowingly good. *drool*   The bread and bagel chips were amazing as always and the ribs well, the ribs speak for themselves.  We've always had great service and food here and this time was no exception. Mary recognized us and told our waitress about us (well, ok, my sisters, not me) and they threw in a free dessert - for all of us. We were there for my Dad's Bday so he was already getting one - but we all ordered something different and nibbled the night away.",

The atmosphere is very lively and the crowd, well the crowd is mainly older (50+).  However, being in my early 30's, my wife and I really enjoyed our time at Don and Charlie's.  The server was very helpful and upbeat.  We never went without a full glass of water or asked by multiple people if we needed anything else, keep in mind the place was packed.    The food was awesome.  I went for the prime rib and it melt in my mouth!  I went medium-rare but rare may have been a better option.  My wife had the schnitzel, somewhat of an odd choice at a steak house/BBQ place, but it was very tender and had a nice flavor.  Not getting salad or soup  with your entree was strange, you get a huge bowl of coleslaw.  It was very good, but different, I believe a salad will cost you a little more.  The potato options are great as well.  Overall, if you are looking for a nice meal with midwestern flair, stop on by.  I will say you will drop some money, but you get a ton of food in return.",

My best friend, Mandy, and I went there last night for dinner...and it was fabulous. Mandy happens to work there as well, so if you go in then you should ask for Amanda. Anyhow, last night...usually when I go to D and C, I wind up getting red meat. Duh. The prime rib is to die for, as well as the Skirt Steak. However, I decided to change it up last night, and go for the Salmon. GOOD CHOICE on my part. Absolutely delicious! I also got a side of au gratin potatoes...they are so good I want to like, bathe in them or something.   The manager came by the table and when I complimented the Salmon he informed me that it was just flown in fresh this morning. In fact, most all of the waitstaff came by to say hello. I mean, I know I have been going there a long time, but I still think its nice that they take a second to come and chat. So aside from the friendly waitstaff and managers, you are also presented with incredibly fresh and tasty food. My kind of place.",

Not going to give them a 1 star as they have killed it forever and hope that some training may help our hopeless server.  Never seen someone serving there that didn't know what he was doing, but this night it happened.  Waited 5-10 minutes for initial greet and forgot multiple items numerous times that we would shave to keep asking for (he was great at apologizing that he kept forgetting).  It wasn't just us either, the table next to us sat without butter or sour cream for baked potatoes for about 15 minutes and had to ask for it twice.

It is a nice little private restaurant that has both lounge, bar, and dining areas.  The decor is amazing.  It must have taken the owners a while to compile such an extensive amount of decorations.    I love the food.  From the burgers to the desserts even to the liver and onions they give you before hand, this place is amazing. it ROCKS. The liver and onions is actually what kept me coming back! Drinks are moderately priced and very fair as far as portions.  Service is where I would have to knock down one star.  The busser, waiter, and bartender was awesome.  As well as the manager in charge or owner that was there when I went.  He remembered me both days that I came in and greeted me with so much kindness.  The hostesses however are not the most fabulous thing.  They are cluttered in a corner when you walk in. No greeting whatsoever.  They just look at you as if you were suppose to greet them.  My first time here I did not know whereI was going, what it would be like, etc.  I was recommended to go here by my friend who plays baseball.  Right when I walk in, I made a quick left into the bar area because the hostesses that were there did not say a single word to me, look at me, or acknowledge that a customer had walked in.  After making a left into the bar area and taking a seat at an empty table with NO reservation sign, the hostess hunts me down and says \"you can not sit there.  This is NOT self seating. you need to wait your turn to be seated.\"  The place was pretty empty, the table was not reserved, and there was no one in the foyer waiting when I came in.  I walked back and had the hostess seat me in the EXACT same spot where I was sitting originally.   Other than that little incident I absolutely LOVE don and Charlies.  The food is great, the decor is spectacular and the service is awesome minus that one little glitch... ehhh, it happens.",

Pouring a lot of Tobasco sauce on it helped only somewhat.  My broccoli had no spices whatsoever, altho it is was overcooked as in most American restaurants.

Great atmosphere, definitely a baseball fan's paradise with memorabilia hanging all over the ceiling and walls.   If you go in March, that place is super packed, it made me forget we were in a recession with the amount of people there!!!! Even with reservations, we still had to wait over 30 min for our table. Sitting at the bar area while waiting, you'll see alot of \"hootchie mamas\" in tight short skirts and hooker heels, probably in hopes of getting lucky with some baseball players or rich old dudes, but at least they were entertaining to look at....so if you're male and single, I highly recommend dining at the bar area.  Anyhow, on to the food....you gotta ordered the blacken  ribeye!! The first bite felt like yummy goodness, it just melted in my mouth, cooked to perfection and the hint of smokiness as well as the juiciness of the meat....HEAVEN!! It also comes with twice baked potatoes and fries. Food size is ginormous so come hungry!!   We tried other stuff on the menu on different occasions, and let's just say nothing compares to the ribeye. A must try place for baseball fans!",

During Suns games and other sports events burgers at the bar for like 8 bucks and for you birthday they give you a 25 dollars off for spending 50.

Don and Charlie, LEY should revoke your membership.  If you're going to advertise your Rogers Park heritage and tout all your North Side hangouts either 1.) be genuinely Chicago (or suburbs!) or 2.) have food so great that everyone can ignore the lack of #1.  Decor is an attemp to knock-off a Loop Chop House mixed with Harry Caray's baseball fanaticism.  Arrived at 5 PM; nobody took our order until 5:20.  Wait staff stood in the back and argued about who would take which section--we had to ask a busboy if we could get service.  Appetizer arrived at 5:40--decent coconut shrimp.  The wife ordered the porkchop--which arrived lukewarm, dry, and hard as a rock.  Her soup tasted like Campbell's Homestyle from a can and the applesauce was like Mott's from a baby food jar.  I had baby back ribs with chicken.  Gents, don't tout your rib abiliities--I've lived all over the US and these were some of the worst I've ever had.  I had to hack (not cut) these with a steak knife and what little meat was on them was unpalatable.  The chicken was pretty good.  The sauce was not \"Midwest\" style.  The creamed spinach was so hot that I had to wait until I had finished everything else to even start tasting it.  Final tally:  $72.72 WITHOUT drinks.  In Chi-town, you would have been run out of business/shot in a driveby for prices such as these--ie:  Scottsdale does not immediately equal Loop (or Lake Forest) in terms of price vs. quality.  The $50 gift card brought this bill down the correct level for the experience.  What surprised me was that by 6 PM this place was packed to overflowing and what appeared to be \"regulars\" were all bellowing about how \"authentically Chicagoan\" they found it to be.  I never write reviews because I like to give places the benefit of the doubt, but this was such an incredible letdown that I had to post something.  Seriously folks--do no waste your time/$.  If you want a Chicago experience, go to Chicago.  If you want good food at a decent price, there are plenty of places in Phoenix that put this joint to shame!",

    "text": "I am an unabashed baseball geek, so suffice it to say that I'd enjoy a baseball-themed steakhouse.  This place has amassed some amazing memorabilia over the years and it is cool to check it all out.  D&C's is always bumping during Spring Training, personally I am one to avoid big crowds and long waits, and have found that I enjoy the memorabilia and the food just as much during the other 10 months of the year.  A wide variety of nice steaks, ribs, and other tasty grilled meats.  Great place to go with your buddies after a day of golf.  The last time I was there, Don, who as one might imagine, owns the place, joined us at our table for a few minutes and told us some great stories about ballplayers that he's met, and even gave us a box of candy for free.  Very nice and genuine guy, and anyone who loves baseball as much as I do is probably a good man in my book.",

I am a huge sports fan and truly appreciate the memorabilia, but first and foremost, I am a \"foodie\" and appreciate great food and great service. This place has EXCEPTIONAL service and food, and one of the best bartenders I have ever met!  Her name is Shelly and people will literally stand and wait for a seat at the bar just so she can wait on them.  I know because I am one of them!  She is friendly, attentive, and makes you feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door - her customer service is OFF THE CHARTS and rare to find these days.  She is truly a GEM!!!  And the food?!?!?  Where should I start???  The shrimp cocktail (the sauce is amazing), the ribs (to die for), the prime rib (OMG) - you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  It is ALL SOOOO GOOD!!! I recommend this place to everyone!!!  It is HANDS DOWN my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!",

The service was excellent friendly and I ordered the prime rib. The prime rib was excellent. They've got quite a diverse menu and next time in town I will definitely go back and try some of the other fine looking menu choices.  The only downside is if you're there for a group, it's a very loud environment and it would probably be difficult to carry on conversation, however if you're there to watch sports and get good food, it's the perfect place.",

Being from Chicago, it was a pleasant surprise to read the history of what brought Don to Scottsdale and see the influence of Chicago and Millers in the restaurant. The ambiance felt like a classic Chicago steakhouse (love the Sinatra music) and the sports memorabilia is mind blowing. The servers are experienced and friendly and the food was plentiful and delicious. So glad we found this classic gem in Scottsdale and would recommend to anyone wanting great comfort food, great service, cool ambiance, or a taste of Chicago!",

Went for an early meal before going out in the Scottsdale area on a weeknight. Led by their amazingly gifted owner Don Carson, the customer serivce is as good as it gets, combining kindness with True assistance, never a difficult moment, made to feel welcome when you walk through the door. Valet parking plus lots of nearly street parking. Love the extensive menu, so many quality choices, and waiting in the bar area is a fun experience. This is the epicenter of MLB spring training baseball and has been since Don & Charlie's opened, a Who's Who of Baseball throughout its operating hours. Stunning amount of sports history on display, including a Babe Ruth autographed baseball, Hall of Famers in abundance. Tip...get the onion strings!!!!! I never miss a chance to visit Don & Charlie's, as it has never disappointed, a guaranteed positive experience with a great, relaxing social vibe. Strong recommendation.",

I have always loved the ribs and have been eating them since I could chew solid food.  I also love that they serve liver pate w/ rye bread slices and various cracker/bagel chips before the meal.  The twice baked potato is fabulous and I'm not really a potato person! I've never had a bad meal here and like I said, I've had plenty of meals at Don and Charlie's.  The meat in general has to be good (I usually stick to the ribs)... my grandfather had a cattle ranch and my father owned a steak house (award winning ribs by the way), so if they like it I'm sure it will please most people!  This is a valley establishment, nothing trendy about it... just a big friendly restaurant, good food and lots of memorabilia in a nice atmosphere of dark wood and crisp white linens.  Quick tip: I would suggest a reservation and they have a private lot that I believe is valet only or mostly valet- so, if you don't have any cash on hand you might have to park on the side of the street or in a near by lot.",

The artichoke dip and bread and chips that came out as appetizers were flavorless and uninspiring.  The service was good, the owner was friendly and all the sports memorabilia was fun.

    "text": "This was my third time at Don & Charlie's. I warned N. (who'd never been here) to make reservations well ahead of time, and she was glad she did!  She couldn't understand why I kept raving about D&C, but once she stepped in the door and was overwhelmed by the memorabilia displayed on every available surface, she understood.  Our server was an old-school waitress, she was superb.  I liked their margaritas from a previous visit so ordered one, and it was just as good.  Skipped appetizers. Okay bread, accompanied by a plate of deli-style garnishes which I didn't eat.  Ordered the beef brochette entree. Fancy name for shish kebab. It was de-skewered before serving, so no wrestling the meat off the stick. The beef was juicy, not overcooked as can easily happen with shish kebab, and the fresh veggies were lightly charred and crisp. Served atop a bed of rice pilaf and mushrooms which I picked at. Sorry, nothing can beat my pilaf.  Ordered the creme brulee as it included chocolate according to the menu. Sure enough, the bottom of the ramekin had an 1/8\" layer of dark chocolate. Nice crispy top too. Yummmmm!!!  I didn't expect any sightings on a Monday night, but at D&C's you can never tell! I noticed a guy who got up from two tables away and seemed to be glad-handing the room as he made his way to the restroom. I casually nodded to N., \"it's Kuip [Duane Kuiper],\" and her eyes got big as saucers! I looked beyond to the table from which he arose, and sure enough there were Mike Krukow, Jon Miller, Dave Fleming -- the entire Giants broadcasting team -- and a fifth guy we couldn't identify; so when they left the room as a group we [me and the Bay Area guy from the party of 4 at the next table] asked 'em, and it was Duane's brother Jeff.  Although it would've been nice to see a current player or two, N. was thrilled with this sighting. In fact, she couldn't even speak to them!  The quality of the food redeemed D&C's from my first visit in 2003 when I had their ribs and found them wanting. Heck, you don't even have to eat here to enjoy the place, just elbow your way to the bar!  Ambiance: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Food: 4.5 stars Hobnobbing with baseball elite: Priceless!",

    "text": "I'm sitting here at work, on yelp, and I realized that I still haven't written a review for Don & Charlie's, and for the life of me I'm not sure why. Actually, when I first started posting reviews on here I was going to write a review for D&C's right away even though I no longer live in AZ and it had been awhile since I was last there.   Well, I was in AZ a few weeks ago for my birthday and came here for dinner. Oh...I guess I should probably mention, every birthday since my early teens (I'm now 30) has been celebrated at Don & Charlie's with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 when I wasn't in AZ on or around the time of my b-day. So with that you can probably see why I'm giving this place five stars.   The funny thing is for as often as I've been here (and there have been plenty of times other than my birthday) I've always ordered the SAME thing...BBQ ribs & chicken (I actually think for that \"last meal\" question on my yelp profile this is my answer). I'll mix it up from time to time though and sometimes get a twice baked potato and other times gratin. I also LOVE there salads that come with all meals. I guess there's nothing really all that special about them, but there balsamic is fantastic! Usually when we come here we get the spinach-artichoke dip for an appetizer, which is creamy & delicious!  Also, since I'm usually here for my b-day they give you this delicious sundae with vanilla ice cream that's encased in nuts, fudge & hard chocolates.  It's Sooooo good!   The service here is impeccable! For soft drinks they actually give you a carafe for each person (I wish they did this for alcoholic beverages ;). One thing that was really cool when I was here the last time was this deal they had going on where they had $15 bottle of chardonnay & Cabernet!  We had a couple bottles of each...why not at that price!   Don & Charlie's really is a place I can go on and on about, but at the end of the day I'd pretty much just be reiterating how great it is, so I'll just stop here :) If you like BBQ, steaks & fish...GO!",

Anyway, my husband ordered the full rack of ribs he said they were tough with little flavor. I ordered the lemon chicken dish that was categorized under pasta but doesn't come with pasta...strange. Needless to say there's too many places to eat in the area... peace out Don & Charlie!",

The Caesar salad we had was below average. No anchovies and packaged croutons. I can't understand that in a good restaurant. Our waiter was bad - patronizing and insincere beyond what I find acceptable in a waitron - and he forgot our appetizer. I will go back if we come down to Scottsdale again. The food was good enough to warrant a return. I'll skip the Caesar Salad and hope for a better waiter. A reservation is a MUST!  What a crowd this place draws!",

We started with the house bread- rye and it was great.  I had a small prime rib, Creamy cole slaw and double baked potato.  It was cooked perfectly and it was accidentally served with a side of whipped cream!  Instead of horseradish but that as quickly corrected and everything was delicious.  My husband had the broasted chicken, half slab of ribs, cole slaw and a baked potato.  It exceeded his expectations the ribs were meaty and well flavored. The ribs and slaw are supposed to be Carson's for ribs recipe.  The waitress kept the wet naps coming!  Next time he might try the spicy broasted chicken. Enjoy !",

Today, the early bird, known as \"Six by Six\" , has returned, but the salad is extra (and smaller than it used to be), the au gratin's are extra (not thoroughly cooked) and the prime rib was delivered to our table medium-well done (we ordered medium).  I used my groupon and was excited to return to Don and Charlies, but we were disappointed in the meal.  We each had a glass (okay, I had two) of pinot noir, and how a restaurant doesn't know that red wine does indeed need to be chilled is beyond me. Adding ice cubes to red wine is intolerable, but had to be done to be drinkable.    Still, this is an old Scottsdale establishment, and I love the feeling of returning to the old days.

    "text": "Update: Don C, the owner, replied to my comment with this: \"Dear Anthony C, Thank you for your rant. Over 2100 guests redeemed their Groupons in the 90 days it ran. Since 1981 I have run D&C's with the guest always in my thoughts. Very happy to honor the $20.00 you spent. Best wishes, Don Carson\"  My reply was this: \"Very happy to honor the $20 I spent, is Groupon fine print policy, so of course you are happy to do it. By not honoring the full $40 value, you lost any chance of my being a customer and all of my friends. Which since I've lived in oldtown since 2004 and go out daily to it's restaurants and bars is not a small number of people. There are too many other places that serve a great steak (bandera's, citizen public house, cowboy ciao, etc)  You are correct, many other people did not get confused like I did. And I am happy for them. They are apparently more clever than I. I tried to come in. I heard your message on a Monday. I got confused. I lost out. If our roles were reversed, I would honor the full $40 groupon for you even if you were the ONLY person who got confused trying to come to my restaurant. Because I thought the purpose of a Groupon was to get new faces in the door.  Especially one that lives walking distance from my establishment and yet has never been in.  Finally, you say you always have the customer in your thoughts? Calling my review a rant is not good customer service. I hope that as folks read your reply they get a clearer picture of your customer service style.  In my opinion my review describes events and my feelings about those events in a logical way, not as a rant.\"  Now here is the best part: Groupon refunded me the $20.  So while Don and Charlie's accused me of ranting, Groupon, who has a FAR larger customer base heard my story and decided a happy customer was worth the refund.  They could have ignored my request given the huge number of clients they have and barely noticed my decreased spending with them.  That is Excellence in Service and I will continue to be a very loyal Groupon customer.  Groupon had this to say when I thanked them for my refund when D&C failed me: \"Hey Anthony,   Thank you so much for the feedback! We appreciate feedback in all forms, but it's all the more gratifying when it's positive.   You've made my day, and we're so happy to have a customer like you. Thanks for your continued support!   Take care,   Shannon T.  Groupon Customer Support\"  THIS is what fantastic customer service means. Groupon has my business forever. Not so D&Cs.",

One of the dudes in a golf cart taxi recommended this place and I would have never known about it otherwise. What a g!  I've paid top dollar for a steak at other places and been disappointed too many times but the NY Strip I had here was hands down the best I've had at a restaurant. The owner actually came over and talked to us about the dry rub they use, told us where to get it, offered to sell us some to take home and gave us instructions on how to prepare and cook our own steaks!! The rest of the group was very pleased with everything as well. We were actually there during restaurant week but most opted for the a la cart meals and it was worth every penny. The beer selection could use some improvement but I didn't go there to drink. Next time I am back in Scottsdale this will be my first stop for dinner!",

Very disappointed. Asked to be seated in dining room after another patron offered his dining room reservation to us because he heard it was my birthday. He was told by the manager it would be \"No problem\" and then the manager puts us in the bar area anyway near the door at a table that was very cramped for 6 people. Then sits a party of 2 in the large booth right behind us after we sit down. Pretty obvious that regular customers get preferential treatment by the manager. The gentleman who offered us his dining room reservation wasn't very happy that the manager told him \"no problem\" about accommodating us and then not coming through.

I'd expect a place like this to be very quiet. Another problem I have is the valet only takes cash they do not  accept Credit or Debit Cards which is really annoying.

It's not pretentious and certainly has marked its standing among the finicky crowd of Old Town. In fact, it reminds me of Frasher's but all love for Chicago rather than St. Louis. You can feast your eyes on every type of sports memorabilia so it's like stepping into a museum of goodies. I have to admit it is geared towards your mature active adults, such that you might find yourself amidst the heated debate between councilmen or City of Scottsdale employees ranting as to why this is the most livable city!   I don't disagree with the most recent Yelp reviews. The food isn't amazing, nor will it knock it out of the park. They do serve schnitzel.; burgers are stacked high and salads are generous in portion. The price tag certainly doesn't justify me choosing this over Wildfish or Ruth's Chris. But if you are looking for low key vibe, chill with the power players of Scottsdale, or missing a piece of Chicago, grab a seat and take it all in.",

My friend told the server he wanted his steak we'll done, so what cut of meat would she recommend.  She told him she could not recommend anything because they didn't recommend steak to be cooked well done.  She again said she couldn't recommend anything.  It was obvious she has not been trained to help her customer.  Then when it came to my order, I told her I wanted it med well, pink in the center, but not red u der any circumstance.  She told me with med well, I would not have any pink.  While waiting for our  meal, she never came back to see if we needed any refill so  water or more drinks.  The meals came. My friend that wanted his well done was pink inside.  Mine came bloody red.  We had to hunt our server down because again, she did not come back to see how our meal was.  Another server found her at the bar talking with someone and sent her over.  I showed her my bloody red steak and she took it back, not acknowledging my friends.  By the time my steak came back the rest of the party was almost finished eating.  I was only able to eat around the edges because the center was still red.  Both of us who had filets were extremely disappointed. No flavor, not cooked at all like we had requested.  I have had steak that cost a quarter of the cost of the steaks at Don and Charlie's and much better in taste and were able to be cooked to perfection. Our server was awful! Again, did not offer refills on drinks and did not offer any dessert or coffe.  Would not recommend this establishment!!!",

It is worth a trip to see all of it, but the Red Sox jersey in front of the ladies room needs to go. Most of the food was hit and miss, but it all is about Chicago this and Chicago that. RIBS - by far do not order the charred style unless you really like eating a burnt hunk of ribs. The regular style was way better, but both were nowhere close to the best ribs ever, not by a longshot. These don't strip off the bone which is what I prefer.  SIDES - redskin mashed potatoes not good and cole slaw was cold and crisp, but not top notch. APPS - the spinach Artichoke Dip was chunky and good and served with great chips SERVICE - very professional, except when they overcharged us 66 bucks (corrected)  It seems like if you have been going here for years, you don't go anywhere else, but I won't be back for anything really. If your famous for ribs and they are average, then it's case closed.  Free birthday sundae was a nice after thought and the Wedge salad was also decent.",

I love a good, old-fashioned steakhouse that doesn't take itself too seriously (no tuxedos, etc.), but that also delivers an excellent meal. While Don and Charlies isn't inexpensive, you could certainly spend a lot more for a similar meal at some of the \"bigger\" steak houses (chains and otherwise). I've never liked the a la carte aspect of the \"fancier\" places. Don and Charlies doesn't do that.  My steak, the New York with the parmesan crust, was fabulous. While I liked the preparation with the parmesan, the steak was the star. Excellent and perfectly prepared. Everyone around the table was more than happy with their food.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I've been going to Scottsdale for Spring Training for 7 years. Just before I left, my buddies Dad a huge fellow Giants fan asked me if I'd been to Don and Charlie's. I said I had not, and he looked at me like I was an alien from Neptune. Apparently, it's like visiting SF and not going to or knowing about Alcatraz. Place is a freaking institution! So, my buddy and I broke away from our large group of 16 and tried to sneak in for a steak dinner on Saturday night. Nothing doing, the place was booked SOLID. Apparently Willie Mays was in the house signing his book. Willie Freakin Mays! When the lady at the check in name dropped Willie, I said \"oh I love Willie Nelson, he's here?\" She corrected me and got the joke. So, with a little smile she let my buddy and I know we could be served at the bar on a first come first served basis. Well, guess what we totally lucked out! The place was spilling over with baseball fans and celebs alike. Hey is that Ray Fosse?!? We were able to grab two bar seats as a couple was finishing up!  So, my buddy and I sat at the bar and had one of the greatest steak dinners ever while surrounded by literally millions of dollars worth of sports memorabilia. Our bartender Shelly was an absolute class act! She set up our table, introduced herself and even remembered our names in what was truly a challenging environment. Now, the food was crazy good and reasonably priced for a nice steakhouse. I had a 16 oz NY Strip ($43) with char crust, au gratin potatoes and washed it all down with a bottle of Malbec $(33). Just as I was done ordering a local sitting next to us noticed it was our first trip. He yelled over, \"Shelly tell them to get the burnt onions.\" Shelly explained they caramelize onions on the grill while bathed in A1 steak sauce which pairs nicely with the steak. Of course I jumped on the suggestion and I was very glad I did. The onions with the steak were heavenly.! My buddy had essentially the same meal but had a 12 oz filet which was also cooked to perfection.   I will surly make Don and Charlie's my first reservation when I book a trip to Scottsdale. And if someone tells me they go to Scottsdale regularly and they haven't been there I will look at them like they're an alien from Neptune.",

Clearly a veteran to the service industry, she's what is sadly the exception to the norm in Scottsdale when it comes to impeccable service.  The prime rib with creamy horseradish is perfect and I haven't had a side item here I didn't love. There isn't a better shrimp cocktail / house made cocktail sauce in town.   The ambiance could use some updating and they do have a patio which appears to serve no purpose, but the walls are plastered with sports memorabilia and pictures of all the people who have had a meal there.  It's classy and upscale but not too pretentious like you might feel sometimes in other fine dining establishments. I will request Mary every time I go and you should too!",

The waitress said people rave about it. When he got the steak, every piece he cut was fatty. He NEVER complains but he was very disappointed so he gently asked she take it back. The waitress was very apologetic and asked if he would like something else, but he didn't. At this point he didn't want anything else, the waitress said the manager would come over. Let me say our waitress Stephani was VERY good, however the manager Corrina has some of the WORST customer service I have experienced! She never came.  I told Stephanie she never came by. She had even just walked by our table, but walked right by. I requested to speak to her. She was full of excuses why she didn't stop by, she was the only manager on, she normally touches every table.....I said as the manager I would think she would definitely stop by tables that had a problem, so apparently there were a lot of problems. There apparently were not problems elsewhere just more excuses. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience due to extremely poor management. We hope others looking to celebrate a special occasion have a better experience!",

I declined because it was really busy and didn't want to wait. Baked potato was good. Service is pretty good and this place has been around forever with many loyal customers but I didn't experience much value this visit and not in a hurry to return.

After cocktails we told him we wanted to order wine with dinner. He told us nothing about the menu and after we finished ordering he explained that we ordered incorrectly - salads and sides were included and not ala carte (the bill said otherwise, but by that time we had given up).  A server brought our entrees and we asked him to get our waiter so we could order wine. Then a woman showed up  (management?) and took our wine order. When she returned with the bottle our waiter came by to tell us that we mumbled our wine order so he didn't understand. I replied that he never even asked for our wine order. The guy was an ass. Eventually waiter returns, apologizes insincerely, and says he's buying our wine.  Our steaks were medium and we ordered med-rare.   Place is rundown, noisy, and unfriendly.  Martini was excellent.",

The host said that the dining room was full, but if we waited in the bar, we might be able to get a table there in about 45 minutes. The only open spot in the bar was in a dark corner with no lights. We got a drink and sat down to wait. After a few minutes, an older gentleman in a blue sweater walked by and asked us why we were sitting in the dark. We told him that it was the only place available for us to wait. Thinking he was a regular patron, my wife asked him what one had to do to get a table there. He replied that he would go see, and he asked our name. Then he wandered off. Five minutes later, we had a table in the dining room!  When we asked our waitress who the older gentleman in the blue sweater was, she relied, \"oh, that's Don...he's the owner.\"  For me, that would have been enough by itself for a five-star review, but the best was yet to come. We both tried the baby back ribs, prepared Don's way, and they were delicious. The sides were equally as good, and the service was excellent. Next time we visit Scottsdale, we will eat here again. We highly recommend this restaurant, but make a reservation!",

So we decided D&C's was the place to go this time.   I just love this place because of the atmosphere and the decor. It's all about sports. Baseball, football, jersey, helmets, and pictures all over the place. If you love sports then this is the place for you. The place is always busy and the table are always close to each other. If you get a table in the middle of the dinning room then there is hardly no walking room. This is all part of the experience.   We had the fried calamari and cheese bread for appetizers. The calamari had a nice crust  and crispy. It was pretty good with the tomato sauce. The cheese bread was good and cheesy. Overall, the appetizers were okay.   We all had the clam chowder and it was pretty good for our area but can't be compared to SF. So I had the full rack of baby back ribs. My wife had a half rack of baby back ribs with coconut shrimp and my kids had the cuda cut prime ribs. The baby back ribs were very good. Mouth watering and the meat would just fall off the ribs. The shrimp were huge and were really good. Prime rib was gobbled up. I also had a double baked potato. So overall the dinner was really good.   So if you have a chance to try this place. Enjoy and have fun.",

    "text": "This was my first time here at the recommendation from the friends we were with and it was also restaurant week. I didn't partake in it but boyfriend did.  The place is a huge memorabilia center...and its full of old people. We were the youngest people there, but I don't think that's a downfall...just funny.  Most people are aware of how restaurant week works - 3 courses usually ranging from $30-$40 on a fixed menu. You also receive a free app when you check in- either the cheesy garlic bread or the onion straws.   One thing I think is a rip off when you do restaurant week with these guys is that if you are two people ordering the restaurant week, you only get one app between the two of you - yet you still pay $30 each. The food is plentiful, but I just don't think that's fair. 4 people out of the 6 ordered from the restaurant week menu and I had the free app so we had the onion straws, cheesy garlic bread, and the spinach dip. The onion straws were bland, the bread was good, and the dip was good.  Boyfriend had the prime rib with the twice baked potato, friends had the ribs with the twice baked potato and another the salmon. All came with cole slaw, either deli (vinegary with a kick) style or creamy (more traditional in my mind). Prime rib was good, not the best, salmon seemed ok from what she told me, and everyone agreed the ribs were the best. The twice baked was yummy (how can you go wrong with baked potato loaded with cheese?  My other friend and I had the french onion soup and the wedge salad. The soup was bland was really pisses me off...this isn't just to this restaurant, its to all. I am not a huge salter, I am very conservative with how I use salt, so for me to go to a restaurant and think something is bland means that it was WAY under seasoned. The salad was good but again, how can you go wrong with something so simple? The portion was huge so boyfriend and I shared that.  I think the real kicked with all of this was the price of the bill. It was $90 per couple including tip which on a regular date night I wouldn't think about, but from what everyone said I was expecting it to be more of a deal and better food. I think anyone is always upset when they don't get what they expect and have to pay a good amount for it.  I would go back here again, but maybe not for dinner, maybe for happy hour or just a couple apps or something. I hate giving bad reviews, and really tried to look on the bright side of our experience and that's why I settled in the middle with three stars.",

Sports memorabilia everywhere.  Over 900 autographed, and glass encased baseballs, line the walls.  Jerseys, bats, pictures, banners, and pennants all over the place.  Now, Laura, the awesome waitress who waited on us Friday night, told me this is a \"San Francisco Giants\" bar/restaurant.  My first reaction, being from Los Angeles and a huge Dodgers fan, was to high-tail it outta there!  But, I got over it and enjoyed our wonderful food.  We shared the fried onion appetizer (check in on yelp and they're free!!).  Real tasty...and huge! (kinda like me hahaha).  Crispy, hot, and seasoned really nicely.  My wife had the ribs with au-gratin potatoes and mayo-based coleslaw (which she said was the best coleslaw she's ever had.  She seemed to really enjoy her meal.  I had the chicken breast smothered in spinach and mushrooms with a very tasty herb-garlic butter sauce.  I didn't care for my coleslaw though.  I chose the vinegar-based slaw.  Over all it was a great dining experience.  We even ran into an old friend.  P.S. - Try to sit in Laura's section.  She's super cool and sweet.  Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?",

The Caesar salad was good, but nothing spectacular. Baked potato - well, what else could they do? So the steak - it was too thick to cook properly. To get the inside to a medium, the outside was overdone, crunchy....\"Char\" is not appetizing. Staff was great, as was the atmosphere. But they really need to look at a 40-50 year old menu and bring it up to date. There are better choices in the area if you're looking for a steak.",

    "text": "Had a great time at Don & Charlies this past weekend. It was my nephew's wedding rehearsal dinner in a room that did a nice job of seating about 100 people. The food was good, but the staff was really amazing.   The servers included Sam, Donna, Christine, Ana Leslie, and Pam. So appreciative of the remarkable job they all did. It's hard to believe that they were able to serve such a large group so well. These guys really know how to do a large group!  So let's talk about the food. The meal started with what I understand is a staple at Don & Charlie's: chopped liver. It was pretty decent chopped liver, but it's hard to get rave reviews from me because my wife's chopped liver is widely believed to be the best in the world. The cheese toast was also pretty darn good and served really hot which, in my opinion, is a must for really good cheese bread.    Our meal included of a choice of salad which included a tossed salad, Cole slaw or potato salad. I choose the Cole slaw and assumed it would be on the side, since I have never had it served as a starter (like a basic tossed salad) but, nope, they serve it before the entree just like a green salad. A little strange to me, but, hell, these guys are entitled to do it any way they want to do it.   Our group had a choice of four different entrees: prime rib, salmon, chicken, or BBQ baby back ribs (I did the ribs, of course). But since it was a family event, I had no problem finding someone to share the other three entrees so I'm here to tell you, all four entrees were damn good. There was nothing unusual about the preparation or particularly creative about their plate presentation. It's just a bunch of good, tasty food served to be chowed. And I definitely chowed! The prime rib was awesome. I love going to Lawry's Prime Rib for killer prime rib, and I gotta say this was some really good prime rib.   The hot fudge sundae was a nice way to finish the meal but I gotta be honest, I was way too full to enjoy it. Although, I did eat most of it! I like the way they serve the hot fudge and whipped cream in separate little serving pieces. It helps keep the ice cream from turning to soup and you can adjust the ice cream, syrup, whipped cream ratio to exactly what you like.  I gotta mention the memorabilia that adorns just about every wall in the place from floor to ceiling. I heard it's all been given the the owner Don, which is not hard to believe since most of it appears to have been signed with a personal note to Don. The guy certainly has received autographed memorabilia from just about everybody. He's even got a baseball signed by Babe Ruth stashed in there, the first one I've ever seen.  Pretty cool place with generous portions of pretty tasty food.",

Wherever you sit, just above your head could be a picture of your favorite athlete, from any sport... that's pretty cool.

Our server was AWESOME... he even made a connection with my sister for his upcoming move out to LA.  His attention to detail and cheerful, fun attitude surly made the night that much more special.

Despite a reservation, we had to wait 30 minutes. They don't have a waiting room, just a sports museum type of long entryway with a very low-hanging ceiling. With a ton of people in the entryway, it started to get very claustrophobic. Once seated, the owner came by and introduced himself. Not sure if it was just because he knew a guy in our party or not, but nevertheless, he was very nice and funny. The waitress had been there for 9 years and was very knowledgable and held good conversation with the table.   As for the menu, it was pretty pricey. I got a burger for $13 because the cheapest steak was a ground beef for I want to say $19. Pretty pricey all around. My burger was typical, big and tasty. I also tried my buddy's fried chicken, which was awesome. All around the table, the portions were huge. There were several to go boxes at our table.  Forgot to mention, MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who has a steak named after him on the menu, came in to dine that night. It was the end of spring training and I'm not sure how often he comes in, but for any sports fan, it's got to be a great endorsement for a place that worships the game of baseball on its walls. Overall, it was a good atmosphere that would make the price worth it on occasion, if I were a resident of Scottsdale.",

It's been a year since I was last here, but the quality of the food and the service are still top notch.  I discovered that when I checked-into Yelp I received a free appetizer, so I opted for the garlic cheese toast, which was awesome.  The ciabatta was toasted perfectly and if I hadn't thought about not finishing the rest of my meal, I would have eaten all of it.  However, I  managed to eat over half the basket.  I ordered the spicy broasted chicken and had to order their two awesome sides (creamy cole slaw and garlic mashed potatoes.  The skin of the chicken was crispy and the meat was both moist and tender.  The spice was perfect (a little heat, but mostly excellent flavor).  This quite possibly was the best fried (broasted) chicken I've ever had.  Plus, they give you 1/2 a chicken and even the white meat was extremely tender.  All I can say is \"Wow\".    I again surveyed and admired all the memorabilia inside the restaurant, while watching the Western Conference NHL Playoffs.  My server (Jaime) was very attentive and offered excellent recommendations for my meal.  Needless to say, I enjoyed another great meal here.",

The server had ZERO personality and had blinders on. He never looked any of us in the eye or made us feel relaxed.    I ordered the burger with fries and then noticed it was $14.00. It was ordered Med-rare w/ cheddar. I received a Well done burger with American no lettuce, tomato, onion, or mayo...

She was at the podium next to the manager when I explained it to her, so it was taken care of very quickly; yet, the burger just didn't taste that good...There was not much seasoning or flavor to the burger...It was just a big chunk of ground beef grilled...boring...

For that crew it's an experience but you can get AN EXPERIENCE by going to McDonalds - it just depends on the palate.  This last time I had the chicken sandwich - Chick-Fil A  has it down. Don & Charley's sandwich is AWFUL. Tasteless, dry YUK!  So far I had ribs - the worst, where's the meat?, several chicken dishes - go to Chick-Fil A, the salads - UGH!  Anybody who gives this place a good score must be a factory worker from Detroit.  Oh, I almost forgot, I had the Clam Chowder.  They have the taste right  but my cup had one clam that hadn't been cleaned - I don't like chewing on sand. Even worst was the texture - clams should be tender and not rubbery.",

    "text": "I've never paid so much to be so disappointed in my life.  This was my dad's Christmas present this year. It's ALL he wanted. After we showed up for our RESERVATION we waited another 10 minutes. We were sat on a very busy night, and I'm trying to keep that in mind. Our female server had little to no interest in serving us - intent on keeping an eye on all her tables. She wouldn't even look us in the eye. Never. Made. Eye contact. My dad is REALLY hard of hearing and asked her to repeat herself. She actually got exasperated. Like...huffed. I'm sorry - look around. That's your clientele. People can't hear. Especially on a busy night.  We ordered, and felt supremely RUSHED. Our dishes were constantly being taken away from us before we were even finished. I ordered the Mahi Mahi, the nights \"special\" - I swear I have seen the exact same dish at Bangle Barbeque in Disneyland. And paid about $15 LESS.   It's pretty sad that the best thing I had that night was the free liver pate. That stuff was amazing. So...yay liver.  We ordered drinks, appetizers, and desserts READ - $$$ - and yet all our server was looking at were the more expensive LOOKING tables. Older gents in suits. Not a family.   Now, I'm aware this is mostly about the server - but isn't that the face of a restaurant? I had a HORRIBLE time - the server severely negatively impacted our entire meal. It was my last weekend visiting my folks. It was awful.  After we paid, we actually went into the bar - hoping to not feel so rushed and relax with each other a little while. It almost felt like it was something the management told everyone to do: servers, bussers, runners - everyone was RUSHING. There was no time to enjoy anything.  Well, the BAR was an entirely different story. We had a GREAT time, stayed a couple hours! Didn't feel rushed, patrons were happy and everyone was having a great time, as was the bartender! I noted to myself that if I HAPPEN to ever come back, I will sit in the bar. It made a horrible night, sting a bit less.  The place is good for sports fans I guess and people in a hurry - or who have money to intimidate, but if you're looking for a great meal, and an enjoyable time, save your money and dignity. Go elsewhere. Except the bar. You can go to the bar.",

    "text": "We went on Friday night to Don and Charlie's with some friends.  We didn't have a reservation so the wait was quite long, which really wasen't a big deal because I knew the wait would be long.  The owner saw that we we had been waiting so he found a table for us. The problem was the waitress was quite busy and when we ordered our food she assumed that we would be sharing so she had everything split.  We asked numerous times for ketchup and she kept forgetting.   The biggest problem I had was that I ordered ribs.  They were so dry that I had to pour lots of sauce over them.  Earlier that night the ASU football team was there, I think they cooked a ton of ribs and had extras that they didn't use, so then they served those to us.  They were the worst ribs I have ever had!  I do love the decor and maybe the food would be better at another time.",

Following a great restaurant set up is amazing food!  wow i love to order sides because they are for sharing and taste so great.    I personally think the steaks here are done right.   Service, 5th Star is always on the service.  People treat you like a home guest.  so many servers have been here for many years.  I can't remember the ladies name that took care of us but she was just a great character .  Some restaurants just bring out the fun personality of its people.    Great place for a big party for those special occasions.",

    "text": "This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?  So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert.   Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.",

    "text": "It's a ritual.  In February, hoards of people flock to Phoenix to escape the chill, play golf, watch spring training, and go to Don and Charlie's.  Don and Charlie's is an institution around this area, especially during February and March.  Dine here and more than likely you'll see a big league player, manager, scout, etc.  Tonight there were some Milwaukee Brewers dining with us.  This place is covered with so much sports memorabilia, you feel like you're dining in a museum.  I think the memorabilia is worth more than the restaurant, and it's definitely worth more than the food.  Expect a long wait if you come at prime time, as this place does get busy.  Food - your typical upscale ribs, steak, and prime rib place.  Good but not great; the memorabilia is the main attraction here and is worthy of four stars.",

The sports memorabilia are worth viewing so I would suggest a visit to the bar, have a cocktail, look around and enjoy the decor.  That's our plan for next year's spring training visit.",

Ordered the broasted chicken, ribs and mac & cheese. Chicken was incredibly juicy and had a great skin. Ribs weren't fall off the bone, but we were told they wouldn't be. The flavor was good (wife didn't like the sauce, but I did). Mac and Cheese was subtle underneath the layer of cheese, which was a nice mix.   Also, we mentioned that we saw them on yelp and we were offered the cheese toast for free. And it was so good we wanted to eat each and every one of them.   Entrees came with cole slaw, but since we are not a fan of that we optioned to change them to caesar salads - for an up charge. Salad had an olive oil twist instead of creamy caesar, which was interesting.  We will be back, and we recommend you do the same.",

They have taken advantage of all the space they have in the restaurant. It was fun to be there. The waiter was super sweet he came often and recommended some dishes. We were given warm bread while waiting for our food. We had the cheesy bread as our appetizer. It was ok but not a big whoop. I ordered a Parmesan crusted steak. It was pretty good wasn't the best I ever tatted but I'd order it again. The order came with coleslaw and I chose a baked potato. The skin had salt and pepper on the tater which made for a yummy twist. All of enjoyed our meals. My daughter chose the brosted chicken which I have to say is the star of the show. It was so juicy and delicious. You have to try it when you go.  For dessert I got the key lime pie which again was ok but I've had better. I enjoyed myself mainly because all the staff was very pleasant and the sports memorabilia was so cool. We all agreed we would go back especially for that chicken.",
