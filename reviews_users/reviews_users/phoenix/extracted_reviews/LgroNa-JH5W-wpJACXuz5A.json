By \"all you can eat\" they really mean \"all you care to eat,\" as they do warn that they'll charge extra for negligent over ordering, but I've never seen that become a problem. For $20 a dinner, I definately get my money's worth - and it includes sashimi! The sushi rolls are great, they also have things like gyoza, fried scallops and crab wontons, as well as some udon and soba.   The atmosphere is great, the restuarant isn't too big on the inside and you do get a lot of families and groups of people, but it's never been loud or hectic. On top of that the service is effecient and quick.   The ordering style is a fill it out yourself form where you mark down the queantity of items you want - and get this - the menu they hand out actually has pictures of EVERYTHING, so there's no confusion as to what you're getting. AND YOU CAN KEEP ORDERING. It's amazing.  Don't forget the green tea ice cream!",

For lunch the prices were great - $12 a person.  The menu is kind of tricky to figure out at first because there are no prices or guidance for what you can order -- but you can order anything off the menu without restriction, and as many times as you want.  Each item comes in a small portion so they suggest you try it first before ordering multiple orders.  We went with the classic edamame, gyoza and shrimp tempura for apps, as well as miso soup and avocado salad.  The gyoza was one of my favorites and I thought it was well executed - crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside.  They have a decent selection of sushi rolls and nigiri and I thought the quality of the salmon nigiri was actually really good.  My mom wanted the chicken katsu cutlet and that was dry and tough, I definitely wouldn't order that again.  Dessert was delicious - fried bananas and green tea ice cream. :)  Can't wait to bring my husband back here -- I'm sure he would love to eat his heart out!",

    "text": "Tough review to write.  Food: 5 Stars Service: 1 Star  I came with a group of 11 for their all you can eat ($12) lunch. Yes, they knew we were coming. 2 hours and 30 minutes later we were finished.   Ok, the good first. The rolls were great. I had 3, which were the 3 listed on the \"Specials\" board, not on the menu. Everyone else really enjoyed their rolls too. There were no complaints on the quality of the food or the size of the portions.   Now for the not so good. They took our food orders (first round) at 12:30. I ordered a spring roll (appetizer) and 2 rolls. 45 minutes later I had nothing. Some people at the table were on their 2nd roll. The waitress had no idea who ordered what and would come to the head of the table with a roll and ask who's it was! Several of us ordered the same rolls and she gave it to whoever's hand went up first, even if they ordered last! A few minutes later I got my first roll. Still no Spring Roll. I asked again about my appetizer. 30 minutes later I got my 2nd roll and placed an order for my 3rd roll. Then after an hour and a half later, my Spring Roll came. Followed 15 minutes later by a 2nd Spring Roll. She must have put in another order when my first one never showed up. It took another half hour to get my 3rd roll. I dared not order dessert, however several people ordered the Fried Bananas, some with chocolate, and some with honey. Needless to say, they messed up on the orders so I ended up getting someone else's messed up order.   The problem wasn't the food, it's the management. They seem to have no system on making and delivering the orders. They should have know which seat the orders went too and not just stand at the head of the table and yell \"Who ordered.....\" Perhaps they do better with small parties. They had 3 sushi chefs preparing the rolls yet it seemed like a long time before plates were appearing on the counter to be delivered. A lot of other customers came and went while we were there.  Perhaps they were delaying our orders to accommodate the other patrons. The jury is still out on whether I'll be back. There are a lot of sushi places closer to my home that have top notch service.",

They don't have any really fancy or exotic rolls but they have everything traditional. I was concerned that at the price point (13 lunch and 20 dinner) the food would not be fresh. It is and this is our 6th trip here in the last 2 months. I won't go anywhere else for sushi even though there are several places closer to us. Check it out!",

    "text": "I honestly don't even know where to begin. We ended up at Akita tonight based on yelp reviewers stating that it's $11.99 all you can eat Sat-Mon. It was a toss up between Geisha's awesome Sunday specials and this. We decided to give someplace new a shot...  We sat down, all you can eat dinner menu in hand, no prices in sight, conveyer belt not on.. We ordered a few spring rolls, edamame, the pork cutlet, and a seaweed salad. The only thing that made it out was the salad... When it came to the sushi, every roll that should have been cold was warmer than room temperature (still crossing fingers that we don't get sick). I decided to try and order some appetizers again.. I ordered two spring rolls, two scallops, a calamari tempura and a shrimp tempura. We eventually got ONE spring roll, ONE scallop, and shrimp tempura... No calamari in sight. Okay... Wanting to at least end on a sweet note, we ordered the fried bananas and vanilla ice cream. My thought was to eat the fried banana WITH the ice cream, however, the bananas came out about 10 minutes after the ice cream, therefore, that was already demolished.   I felt that even with all of the screw ups, it was almost decent enough to be what I thought would be a $24 bill for two people. WRONG!!! To my surprise, dinner is apparently $19.99 a person, which nearly doubled my expectation. Knowing that I could have had an amazing meal at Geisha for half of what I paid is still not sitting well with me.   It is also worth noting that nobody that works here seems to know what they are supposed to be doing. We had three different people taking our orders, which probably explains why we didn't get half of our food. They should really think about giving customers an order sheet/pencil like most other sushi restaurants. It would probably make it much easier on the employees and give the customers a better experience. They should also, perhaps, post prices somewhere. Even if it's just on the big white hand written poster boards taped all over the building advertising the all you can eat special. There was no place to verify prices since there is no website either.   In conclusion, Akita really needs to get their sh*t together if they want to stay open. We definitely don't plan on going back anytime soon... If ever...",

My husband ordered a salmon hand roll, and instead of putting actual pieces of salmon in it, there was some type of salmon paste.  It looked like sawdust, and tasted terrible.  The beef teriyaki was terrible.  My husband said that he would not even feed it to our dog.  The pieces of fish on the nigiri sushi were so thinly sliced that it was mostly rice.  The fried zucchini was not as crispy as it could have been, and the seaweed salad was warm.  For $21 a person, it was a total rip off for dismal food.  We will never go back there again.  We have been disappointed too many times by mediocre food that is not worth the price they charge, even if it is AYCE.  Go to a happy hour somewhere else with decent food.

And I just can't contain This taste that remains  Sushi buffet time!   I came on a Friday night with my group.  ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi/sashimi for $20 - count me in!  I went for sashimi; mackerel, tuna, salmon, tempura vegetable, and the Volcano Roll.  The sashimi to me was pretty good and basic and so was the tempura vegetable.  The Volcano roll came with tuna, crab, cucumber and deep fried while drizzled with chipotle mayo, siracha, and a brown sweet sauce I couldn't make out. I would say this combo worked well.    Things got more interesting when Chef Sam came out to speak to us about what he can do and make for us; so I was like well show us what you can do!  Thus, he made us some specialties; Smoky Roll, Nanuto Roll, and Ninja Roll.  The Smoky roll was crab meat, seaweed salad, topped with yellowtail, salmon roe and doused with mayo and brown sauce; and yes you can taste the smoke, which was the interesting part.  The Ninja roll was a clean roll; no rice, just wrapped with seaweed was tuna, crab, avocado, and topped with wasabi aioli.  The Nanuto roll, my favorite of the night, was again a clean roll; wrapped with cucumber, salmon, tuna, roe, and drizzled with ponzu sauce!  Overall the experience took a 180 once Chef Sam came out to speak to us and show us is specialty!  Service overall was on top of things and the place was clean and welcoming.  In the end, gotta thank Chef Sam for making this a wonderful experience! - Enjoy!",

My favorite item I had was the spicy Cali roll. The rice on most of the rolls was quite warm, which warmed the fish. Dinner price for all you can eat off the menu is 22.99.

Big selection from appetizers to entree to Ramen or Udon Noodles to Sushi to desserts.  All orders are small like tapas but you can order as many as you like.  It is good to order in small quantities so you know if it is something you really want or like and then go back and order in \"mass quantity\".  I started with the appetizer and got the tempera shrimp, deep fried scallops and gyoza. All 3 were prepared very well so I reordered in larger quantities.   Also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and Teriyaki Salmon. Both were excellent so I asked for another order of each. Keep in mind all orders are small.  I also tried the shrimp tempura sushi which was also very good.  I ordered the seafood Ramen which comes in a very small bowl and was probably one of the least favorite dishes.  The best dish was the teriyaki salmon which had a good consistency while having that crispy edge.  The soda drinks were also endless.   That people waiting on us were very good however some of the dishes took some time where we could not remember whether we ordered them or not.   Now keep in mind the restaurant states any uneaten food will be charged on top of your regular buffet bill.  Overall I was impressed with the overall concept and $11.99 lunch price.  I look forward to returning to eat here again.  Arigato!!",

Nigiri sushi has big chunk of rice and super thin fish but thats ok bc sashimi is very expensive.",

The extra price for dinner is because they add certain items for dinner like certain special sushi rolls. But I almost always go for lunch because their variety is still great.  Now food quality. DO NOT expect 5 star sushi quality ok? Be reasonable. Their fish is not flown in from Japan daily ok? But it is still good quality for the price. Again, my word was VALUE. For the price, the food is great!   Recommendation: Gold Roll. I have yet to find a better tasting roll ANYWHERE. Its freakin' great. I also like the nigiri because its thinner pieces of fish which I like.   Overall, try this place if you love sushi. One of my absolute favorites.",

Not a good setup to celebrate a friends 21st birthday. The waiter was serious and not friendly at all. I was serving my friends like I worked at the restaurant. We didn't get to order until 30-45 mins after we were setup.   Sushi was quite delicious and for an AYCE for about $21! Great price and food! The interior design of the restaurant looked awesome and bathrooms was very unique with how the flows to your hand. I will give this restaurant another shot b/c it's definitely worth it.

    "text": "The most craptastic AYCE sushi I've ever had.  No wasabi dabbed in between the fish and rice. The supplied wasabi was in the form of a rigid block, dried out, and possibly stale. Even worse than the wasabi served at revolving sushi bars.  There was too much rice in the nigiri that created an imbalance in the flavors of fish and rice. I like sushi rice, but that's all I tasted in the nigiri, no matter what type of thin sliver of fish was slapped on top of the rice.  Really awful salmon and tuna, each piece had a firm and chewy flesh. Somewhat similar quality to the frozen fish served at Chinese buffets, they all lacked moisture. The yellowtail and white tuna were a little better and were the only fish worth repeating.  It was my first time being served warm mackerel from a sushi bar. Maybe it was cooked or toasted together with eel. Aside from having an odd slimy texture, the mackerel was flavorless for this type of fish.   The spicy yellowtail handroll was as dry as the Arizona desert. The ingredients wrapped inside the nori were salty and rough, and reminded me of eating dried shrimp.  Either the sushi chefs were uninformed or being cheap. They served a piece of kale with sashimi, and added a sliver of nori in between the ika and sushi rice. Have they ever eaten these with shiso leaf before? That would be a better choice of ingredient in my opinion.  To sum up my experience, the meal was a waste of calories.",

However, because I am a fantastic wife that allows her husband to choose a restaurant on his birthday, I've learned to live with it.  My secret is looking for shellfish and avocado and drowning the poor bastard (the sushi, not my husband) in soy sauce.  So, we arrive at Akita.  I like the name.  It reminds me of a big fluffy dog.  I like it that I can inspect the plates as they pass by on the little conveyor.  If this was a concept at a Mexican restaurant, I would weigh an easy 400 pounds.  I wished there were a menu available of what was in each roll, but no worries, if I didn't like it, birthday man would eat it.  And actually, my visual assessment of the ingredients was pretty good.  I liked everything I chose.    Although our drink order was taken promptly, I did have to ask for them when it became clear it was never going to happen.  I can only imagine it was an oversight, as the restaurant was not busy.  My only real complaint is that there were huge gaps on the belt.  I get it that since it wasn't busy, they didn't want to overload it with food that wouldn't be served in time.  But the spacing should have been better.  At times, it took a good 10 minutes for anything to pass by.  I also would have preferred fewer pieces on a plate.  Most plates had at least 4 pieces of sushi.    But overall, for a newly opened place, great job!  And for $35, we had a stack of plates.  My husband was a fan as well.  Hopefully, he'll write his own review.  But I'm not counting on it.  My work is never done.",

    "text": "just opened! i got 2nd to review!  i love the revolving sushi concept...because it's cheap and it's quick. you sit at one of numerous bar type seating areas and a conveyor belt runs in front of you with smaller portions of rolls and sushi items. you simply pick out the ones you want without having to wait for table service.  they give you a full service menu as well, and it describes what each roll is (beyond the obvious ones). the sashimi selection on the revolver is limited but the prices are inexpensive so you don't have to order a whole roll to find out you don't like something.   the sushi and sashimi we did try was very good, tasted fresh, and i wasn't at all worried about a second rate sushi place. i first tried a place like this in new mexico and loved it ever since, but this is the first place i've seen it since then. i've heard it's popular in japan......and it is popular to me!  prices range from 1.50 for 2 pieces of mackeral nigiri up to 5.00 for 3 pieces of salmon or tuna sashimi. average for items is 3.00.   i love it, and will be back!",

It should also state \"As much patience as you have for the process\".  That would be more appropriate since I know that I could have surely eaten more, but was ready to get going long before my appetite was satisfied.  The place feels a little cold when you enter.  Not terrible but certainly not a cozy inviting atmosphere.  They still have the steel things in place from when they must have tried to make it revolving sushi and the waitresses are nice but speak little english it seems.  The busboy must've gone past us 4-5 times with an empty cart that he kept pushing and had a shirt on from a local auto mechanics shop.  We ordered gyoza, fried rice, teriyaki beef and a seaweed salad for apps.  The seaweed salad arrived right away, the fried rice and beef 7 minutes later (more than 5 less than 10 at least) and the gyoza didn't make it for over 20 minutes.  We presumed they forgot but they didn't.  Still, it came well past our sushi that we then ordered.    They were super disorganized.  I didn't know if people were waitresses/waiters or cooks or busboys.  I kept trying to make eye contact because I didn't know who was supposed to wait on us and who wasn't and eye contact was difficult.  And there was no rhyme or reason to when or how the orders placed would arrive.    We finally felt pressured to order desert and so we did.  Fried bananas and green tea ice cream.  They came out in this order:  1.  Fried bananas 2.  Beef fried rice that had been ordered 15 minutes earlier 3   5 minutes after the green tea ice cream.  Thats banana's B A N A N A S!  I can hear Gwen Stefani singing it now!  Just an arduous process.  The sushi was fresh but nobody points out the specials on a blackboard in another area of the restaurant.  Pieces not large, but for $20 if you've got the patience you could surely clean up.  But you've gotta be OK committing a lot of time because orders don't come quickly (well some do some don't...you have no idea which is which).  I think I've gotta get drunk first next time.  Then I'd probably love it.  But for a structured night this was not the call.",

    "text": "When this place first opened, I was excited to have a revolving sushi place so close to my work. Revolving sushi is usually inexpensive, and makes for a good lunch to break up the monotony of the work week. We didn't have a chance to check it out until this weekend, and I don't think I'll be going back.  I guess the whole revolving thing bombed for them, so they went to an all-you-can-eat menu. Good in theory, but in practice, it left much to be desired. It's $11.95 a person, and the menu has everything from various appetisers (gyozas, yakitori, edamame, etc) to soups, fried rice and udon entrees, to sushi.   I just wasn't impressed with anything, really. Our server was nice, but the food just wasn't worth it.   We got tempura shrimp, and stir-fried seafood udon to start. The tempura was ok, but nothing special, but the udon was squishy, and lacking flavour. For sushi, we got the eel and avocado roll, the spicy yellowtail and the shrimp tempura roll.   None of it was anything to write home about. I've had better. Way better. I guess for $28 the amount of food we got was ok, but when I really had to choke it down, it just wasn't worth it.",

However, the last couple of times have been disappointing. I am an avid miso soup lover, thus I will often order soup with every round of sushi. With that said, this last time I came here, the waiters were rude and were constantly laughing at my order to one another. I understand that miso soup is typically not ordered multiple times, however, that is not a reason to make fun and joke around about my order. I did not feel welcomed and extremely disappointed with my last visit. Additionally, I ordered a hot green tea and had to continually ask for refills, while also reminding my waiter multiple times that food we had ordered had not been brought out yet.",

They did a nice job on the inside with the sushi conveyor belt, sushi bar, etc. The entrance looks tired and dilapidated - we almost turned way before we walked in. A tired door, a curtain over the glass (on the inside), a weatherbeaten and abandoned menu box outside all contributed to a look of a neglected restaurant.  The service and friendliness of the staff was top notch. We were warmly greeted when we arrived and got a nice thank you on the way out. They kept our area clear, our tea and water full, etc. Actually, this was some of the best service I've seen a while in a restaurant of this price range or even a bit higher.  Now, to the main course - the sushi. It was average - not great, not bad. And for sushi, not bad is a good thing. I like this much more than Sakana's too large of portions and too low quality seafood. There's a reasonable selection of items on the conveyor and a lot more to be had in the conventional menu. None of the conveyor items were particularly noteworthy and none had the \"wow\" factor of terrific seafood or a terrific roll recipe. But none was bad either.  I think I'll be back - quick, friendly, reasonable prices, reasonable food.",

You really can't go wrong when you walk in and find more Asians rolling the sushi than the actual patrons! Staff is attentive and friendly without being imposing as you consume an entire continent of sushi to your stomach's content. The quality is far better than I expected for a revolving sushi joint; my fave is the sweetheart roll. I will have to make a trip back with my entourage to see how the rest of the menu fares from the conveyor selection. I'm excited it is in my backyard! Give it a try and tell me your thoughts :)",

Akita has a pretty extensive menu which also includes non-sushi and dessert dishes, perfect if you have that one friend that doesn't like sushi but wants to come out.  If you go for dinner (4:30 and later), the price is $20.99 and it includes AYCE sashimi which is almost impossible to find elsewhere!  The service is sometimes slow depending on how busy and who your server is but Brian (my favorite server) is exceptional!  I gave 4 stars based on sushi quality/value but I would give 5 stars on Brian's great service.  So let's call it a 4.5.  I'm big on value for my money and this place provides that.  Is it the best sushi in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area?  No.  Is it the best value in the area?  I believe it is!",

Food is decently fresh, portions are mini, but that's a great way to eat lots of different items.  There are a lot of different items on the AYCE menu too - surprisingly nice.   I was expecting a pared down AYCE menu, but this was not the case at all.  They have all kinds of apps - spring rolls, soup, seaweed salad, gyoza.  All different types of rolls, even special rolls. Ramen, udon, fried rice, terrayaki too.   Limited beer and wine menu.  Flat screen tvs above were all on ESPN.  Eat all the food you order because 1. it's wasteful otherwise 2. you get charged the full price for each item you don't finish.",

Even my vegetarian wife loves eating at Akita for the tempura, veggie rolls, and other spectacular meatless dishes. The quality of each roll/dish is easily on par with or better than the competition in the valley, and the price for all-you-can-eat makes it the best deal hands down.

    "text": "While in the area, I was in the mood for sushi so simply picked the closest place to where I was. This sushi place is an all you can eat establishment where you order what you'd like and they bring it to the table. I prefer this type of sushi place over a salad bar type of sushi place as the rolls are made fresh. Our server was just OK, sometimes we needed something like more drinks or napkins and we had to wait a bit till we saw him again. My rolls were good, the tempura type stuff was OK but my California roll had very hard pieces of avocado which were not quite ripe so I had to take them out individually in order to finish it.  Not a big deal really but I've never had to do that before. I would go back again if in the area. I will say the presentation of some rolls were quite pretty. (Update 6/2018) I've been back a few times, service is just OK, last time our server walked away while I was still talking asking a question. It wasn't even that busy. Overall you come here to eat a lot of sushi, that's it. It's just OK really. I prefer quality over quantity personally. Also, I ordered the veggie fried rice and got chicken and the person who delivered it just looked at me like he didn't understand what I was saying. I find this has happened a few times now. If you love sushi and want a lot of it, go here. If you prefer quality of service and food, try someplace else.",

Admittedly, sushi is pretty good, lots of variety. The nigiri, though, just doesn't taste as good as I think it could be.  Absolutely adore their tempura! I could eat that for hours.  Their chicken teriyaki is a little lacking, though.  Notes: they no longer have mango ice cream when I went! They have Butter Pecan, Mango, and Vanilla. The butter pecan ice cream was absolutely superb with the honey coated fried banana!  If nothing else can convince you, go for their bathrooms. Seriously. Go to their bathrooms. You will message your friends about it.",

The specialty rolls are SO DANG good. I wanna go every day, totally would if it was realistic   The appetizers are exceptional as well.

Do not pass up the green tea ice cream and deep fried bananas, also go wash your hands, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise in the unique decor of the restrooms.

There wasn't anything that we ordered that was old or not fresh. We had yellowtail sashimi which was my favorite.  The rolls were good as well.

I like that for $12 you can get all you can eat sushi including seaweed salad, tempura, etc.- basically it's a buffet freshly ordered and prepared.   I will be honest and write that I was initially skeptical at the quality of the sushi for the price. And I was pleasantly surprised!  The nigiri is tasty and fresh, not on giant pieces of rice as it sometimes can be.   I usu get the miso soup, seaweed salad, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, California roll and that's pretty much all I can eat before becoming full.   Next time I need to bring some more friends so we can order more sushi and rolls together for me to taste some of the speciality rolls.   The clean rolls Bao H. described sounds wonderful. I will have to order those next time I go in.   The only minor comment I will make is that despite the fact that the interior is nicely decorated, the now defunct conveyor belt for the rotating sushi is a distraction. It makes a poor impression upon initial walk in.   I'm not sure what they can do about it since I am sure it was expensive to install & will be expensive to remove.   Aside from this minor distraction, this place is great for an all you can eat sushi joint!",

My usual AYCE place in the Chicago suburbs is $5 more expensive with half the options.   Tempura: A- Miso Soup: B- Garden Salad: C (It wasn't actually bad, it just want the ginger dressing I've come to expect from places like this) Salmon Nigiri: B+ (too much rice but the fish was very fresh) Volcano Roll: A+ Sweet Potato Roll: A+ California Roll: B- Rainbow Roll: A  There is absolutely no beating the $12.99 price (lunch special) for the quality of sushi.   I would agree with the other reviewer who says stay away from the nigiri. There is a LOT of rice with a very small sliver of fish. But on the flip side of that coin, it's really really fresh and good.   And speaking of other reviewers, it is absolutely standard for an AYCE place to charge for anything you don't eat. That's how it works. So if you didn't know that already, consider this your heads up.",

    "text": "This is my favorite buffet style sushi place.  The fish is very good.  You get appetizers for one price. Lunch does not offer sashimi BUT dinner does.  The dinner price is twice the price of lunch.  Overall I have been here maybe nearly 10 times since moving to Arizona 8 months ago.  And overall it's a solid 3 stars. The things I don't like is every time I order spicy salmon or spicy tuna or spicy fish it comes with tempura flakes and it's kind of lacking in the raw fish department.  I learned that the best way to order sushi, is by ordering a hand roll.  If you want sashimi, you will have to wait for dinner.  The place is worth the trip if you need a quick raw fish fix or you want to entertain more than one friend.",

No authentic gyoza sauce, but a syrupy pink sauce that was worse than the packaged stuff.  The salad was drowning in a sweet vinegary concoction that didn't resemble anything Asian. We couldn't eat any of it, yet they insisted we pay anyway. It was a very disappointing experience.",

Dinner comes with sashimi, lunch doesn't. Anyway, this place has a variety of food for AYCE! It has fried rice (REALLY GOOD FRIED RICE BTW!!!!!), udon, soba, fried udon/soba, fried bananas, ice cream, and I can go on......The service here is really good everytime I've gone and I just think it's such a good price for ayce (especially lunch!!!). My favorite roll here is the Manhatten roll and my overall favorite food here is the beef fried rice. For some reason, the fried rice here is just really good, very flavorful...and I usually end off my meal with fried bananas (in honey or chocolate...OR YOU CAN HAVE BOTH!!) and vanilla ice cream. This is definitely my go to spot for sushi! Would come here on the daily if I lived closer!",

Place your drink order with the server. (Generous refills on non-alcoholic drinks!) Check off your selections (sushi, sashimi, appetizers, hot wok items, and dessert.) from the paper slips, and off you go.  Tip: Plan your orders as needed, as everything is made to order. Also, keep in mind that your eyes may be bigger than your stomach. There is a $5 charge if you're not able to finish what you ordered. I've only fallen to that once. (Once - during lunch. I'm pretty good otherwise.)  The miso soup is pretty basic, but then, it's about the sushi and sashimi here. The tempura battered shrimp and veggies are pretty much what you can expect for decent stuff. (The shrimp are delightfully crunchy outside, tender inside!), and I have not been let down by the fish, either by itself on beds of shredded daikon (white radish), or in rolls, or as nigiri (Fish on rice.)  Keep in mind that sometimes they do run out of garden salad. I do agree with Ian L's writeup, they could stand to improve the salad dressing, but if you want greens with your fish, go for it. ^_^ (They do also offer Edamame, in generous portions for one, or to share with others in your group.)  Personal favorites for the special rolls: Amazing Tuna Roll, Out of Control Roll, and Tuna Mango Roll.   I'm usually there every week or two, decent value, food, though I usually hold court there for about an hour, it's a good place to check out. (Parking can get a bit packed some weeknights.)",

This place has good ratings on google I was surprised to see some of the bad reviews on yelp. The service is fine, wait staff was attentive and we are always seated quickly. Will be returning many times.",

    "text": "Finally an all-you-can-eat sushi place in Scottsdale. I could not wait to give this place a try.  Thanks YH!  Upon entering I was greeted by the host who did not seem very happy to see me but was cordial. I was alone and chose a seat at the sushi bar. I was expecting it to be crowded but I was actually the only person sitting at the bar.   After looking at some of the pictures posted on this site and trying to find some of them on the lunch menu, I realized that a lot of the nice rolls you see pictured are on the dinner menu.  That is completely understandable since the lunch price is a ridiculously low $11.99.   I ordered the Eel Avocado and Yoshinko rolls, as well as some standard nigiri tuna, white tuna, salmon and yellowtail. I eat quite a bit of sushi in quite a lot of restaurants and this is certainly standard quality, but  the value for the price is outstanding.  Please keep in mind what little you pay at this place when you come in and give a critical review about the presentation and quality.  The service was very good, the sushi chefs were pleasant and overall I like the atmosphere of this place. The location is conveniently a one minute drive off the 101 freeway.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying dinner. That price is a whopping $20.  Also looking forward to seeing what rolls are offered on that menu.    I would recommend raising the lunch price and offering a better assortment of rolls. And honestly I think dinner should probably be in the $25-$30 range.  Even then you could get \"sushi drunk\" and still only pay what you would typically pay for two full-sized rolls.  Food coma!   I just had some top-notch sushi and sashimi with a friend at Roka Akor.  It's nice to pay for that quality sometimes, but it's also nice to hit a place like Akita and go big for a small price!  Roka will run you 10-15 times the cost of Akita.   Be sure and tip well. I typically give 50% and take care of the chefs in AYCE places. Personally I feel guilty eating a ton of sushi and paying $25!    Give this place a try and enjoy!  Arigato!",

    "text": "I've been reading about Akita Sushi for the past few months and finally had an opportunity to take my son there last Saturday. It was a good experience and we enjoyed the variety, friendly service and $11.95 all you can eat menu for a weekend lunch. Appetizers were hot and freshly made to order,  so it took longer than. expected, but that was okay and understable since there wasn't an empty table there. A plus was that half of the tables were occupied by other Asian people. That's always a good sign when going into an Asian restaurant!  what I liked is that it was not a buffet with troughs of pre-made food. The menu had a large selection and you could order as much and as often as you like. Portions are small but that was ok, so you get a chance to sample more. Just be sure to not order more than you can eat because they can charge you for items you don't finish. When you get your bill, everything you ordered is itemized with a cost of $0.00 next to each dish you ordered.  If you don't eat it all, there will be a price other than $0 there for the dish you did not finish.    I was happy this wasn't just an all you can eat California roll place. There was a large variety of appetizers to choose from and good selection of sushi and rolls. I've had better but not for $12 and the sushi was not bad at all. The same selection  we had at any other sushi bar would have cost us $75 + easily. The drinks were an additional $1.99 each. I read in previous reviews that drinks were included for $11.95, so maybe this is a weekend thing or just a change in the pricing?  We will definitely be going back in the future.",

Sushi rolls where super tiny and so was that deep friend banana, they where cheap and gave me half of a banana. WORST PART OF IT ALL they charge you for your left overs if you don't eat all your food and you are not allowed to take it home. Sushi was not fresh and warm and my Las Vegas roll was undercooked the deep fried was still batter on the bottom. WILL NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER BE BACK!",

I've always been a huge fan of eel (unagi) and they have several different options with eel involved. I highly recommend house special roll \"#121 Green Dragon\", eel and cucumber inside the roll topped with avocado and eel sauce. Delicious!

It took a long time sitting there to get over the stentch. Next came the glass of ice water., I could taste the seafood funk even before I put the water in my mouth., disgusting. Like the ice is bad., like bad as in they store seafood in it and then serve it to customers., that's what it tasted like.   How can the people who work there not know this? I had to buy a $4 bottle of sealed water to get thru my meal. Apparently they'll be closed on Monday for summer, I highly suggest they use that day to do deep cleans throughout every inch of the restaurant. The food actually was pretty good., normally I would have left, but I came as a guest and I did not want to be rude to my host, but if I would have came by myself I would have turned right around.  I was surprised I didn't get sick afterwards, but still back in my mind I'm like I could have gotten a tape worm or something.  The health department needs to check this place out., the smell, water and ice alone are huge red flags.",

I wish I knew this going in because I would totally pay the extra money for the sashimi. The nigiri was NOT worth it at all. They slice their fish very thin and give you a regular portion of rice so it fills you up quick.   The rolls on the other hand were pretty good. Everything I ate was pretty fresh and tasty. Love the salmon skin hand rolls and the eel and avocado hand rolls.   I thought it was pretty neat that they have other items on their menu for non sushi eaters but I don't recommend that either. The fried scallop was fake scallop, the stir-fry beef udon literally came out with no beef and just taste like udon in soy sauce, the spicy udon came out tasty very strongly of Sriracha and it was luke warm...  the winner was the fried rice, can eat that all day.  Other than that, the food came out super quick and I love that there's ice cream on the menu.  Maybe I'll come back to try out the dinner for sashimi but this place is extremely far from me and did not leave a good impression already.",

    "text": "The all you can eat lunch here is incredible. I've come probably 5 times now and the sushi is all made to order. The fish also tastes surprisingly fresh for an all you can eat lunch. My favorite here is anything with Salmon. Honestly haven't had a bad dish here (except the deep fried scallops aren't great). I do wish they had some kind of scallop roll but it's understandable for buffet style. The service is friendly and beyond worth the price. I would recommend this place to everyone!  UPDATE (03/04/2018) I have visited this restaurant probably just under ten times now and every single time that I have been, the food has been wonderful and delicious. I have had a couple visits that had long wait times for food but what do you expect with freshly made sushi? Either way, you cannot go wrong with this place.",

Thought sashimi was a bit chewy for my taste. I like a very tender pieces. Had salmon and yellow tail. Sure portions are somewhat small but you can go for a second round. Lots of complaints from other reviewers is portions. Well just order a second round..!  Anyway. Has an out of control roll. It fell apart at the time of trying to pick it up with chopsticks- no big deal. Thought green tea ice cream was fantastic! Avocado salad was somewhat disappointing but miso soup right on point, although gyoza was more reminiscent of potstickers (was was still tasty). Overall I haven't decided if I'll be back or not. Probably...  PS alcohol is not included  PPS fun, unusual bathrooms  PPPS somewhat trashy parking lot (lots of cigarette butts) and overflowing garbage bins (first impressions)",

The quality is a disappoinment, the sashimi is thin and they wrap the roll full of rice just to fill you up. Just like any other Chinese buffet that have horrible quality food but in a vast amount just to fill you up. DONT GO HERE.",

The dessert choices were okay, but I wish there were more options for that. I really like the aged tofu from the appetizers. The taste is subtle and not too heavy. I also like how they have seaweed salad as well. Their seaweed salad tastes fresh, not too fishy or sea-like taste. The sushi are tiny and cute. I definitely will be coming back here.

Okay, different but great price. Well, we got our drinks and first round of our sushi order in good time but then never saw our server. When we FINALLY ordered our second round of what we wanted (35 minutes later...seriously) we didn't get half of what we ordered and it took another 20 minutes to get it. Fed up, we left to get our bill which was way higher than we were told ($20 a person) and when we told them about what happened, they just said they are short staffed (which I guess is the guests' fault) and took our card. We didn't have the option to pay only for the food we actually received, or pay what was deserved and fair. No offer to discount, come back again, anything.  AVOID.

They have around a half dozen kinds of fish to choose from but when filling out the sashimi form, you are ordering by the \"piece\" and not an \"order\" of the said fish. The pieces are tiny, so if you want tuna, for instance, order at least 6 pieces.   The seaweed salad is good.",

But their nigiri don't have much rice on them either. There sushi stuff is pretty good. Their Las Vegas roll comes out piping hot.   I don't suggest getting Raman udon or fried rice. It's very very bland and just bleh. Their appetizer are okay but obviously I'm here for the sushi.  They also include 3 different flavored ice cream: green tea, mango, and vanilla.  Don't forget about the fried banana, my friend got it and said it was good.  The only thing preventing a 5 star is their service. It's not that organized and can be a bit slow.

I'm new to the area and have been trying out many different sushi restaurants. I'm a connoisseur. I know my sushi.  I roll up to Akita and notice that it's pretty dead. I figured that this was due to the holiday, but I soon realized that this may not be the reason at all.  I went inside and ordered two rolls. I noticed that they were extremely small, 6 piece rolls. They were average tasting. Nothing special.   At this point, I thought \"Ehh, average. Probably won't come back here, but not terrible.\"  Then, I got the bill. I assumed that for 2 small six piece rolls, it would be maybe $10-15 tops (before the tip).   NOPE! $25. This is the biggest bill I've ever gotten at a sushi restaurant for friggin California and Philadelphia rolls. This was also the first time that I didn't leave any tip at all (I always leave 20% unless the service is bad, in which case I leave 10%). But I've never left 0% in my life.  I don't regret it though.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner, party of 6, on a Friday night. Never been here before and heard pretty good things about it. It was pretty busy when we got there but there wasn't much of a wait we had like 2 parties before us, unfortunately we weren't seated in order. Since we had a bigger party, we had to wait almost an hour to be seated. There were like 4 parties that got seated before us on top of the 2 that was there before. I wish that they had a better system in seating big parties.  We were seated in a huge booth though, more than enough space for 6 people. Right away we filled out the paper to get our orders. I love the fact that the price of 20.99 (for dinner) included sashimi, nigiri, regular rolls, hand rolls, fried rice, chicken teriyaki, dessert and more....like ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT! I mean in our party of 6 we had one guy didn't eat and a child, so technically 4 adults eating. We kinda sucked because we only had like 2 rounds of food..  We did order 25 salmon and 25 tuna sashimi right away, and 20 salmon nigiri, plus like 5 other rolls, edemame, and cheese wontons (which were sooooo bomb).   At first, the server tried to tell my friend that he can't NOT eat (but he was full, he was just there to hang out). In the end, they didn't end up charging him, which was nice.   Ooohhh their mango ice cream was bomb!!! soo good def try it! Served in individual one scoop bowls but since AYCE u can order as many scoops as you want.  Anyways...def worth the money. Sushi qualitywise is pretty good for the price.  Will be back again!",

I'm not really sure how a ayce sushi place can only be $12 for lunch and still remain open because the sushi is actually surprisingly good!   With the lunch buffet there's a menu of 100+ items that you can order including many tempura items, nigiri, pork/chicken cutlet, soba/udon/Ramen, sea weed salad and a myriad of both regular and specialty rolls! And to top it off you can get mango, green tea, or vanilla ice cream to finish off your meal!   The price and quality definitely can't be beat and it's a nice surprise that there's so many appetizers/sides you can order as well (in comparison to mido sushi in Chandler). Unfortunately it seems like they do mix up orders quite a bit cause the last two times I've gone, we've had some repeat on rolls and even rolls arrive that we didn't order. On a side note, check out the bathroom, it's pretty cool!",

We ordered 6 rolls and only ate half because of how dry the sushi was. We waited about 15min just to get our check which we had to ask a different waiter to give us. When we got the check our waiter said he has to charge us an extra $30 for the left over sushi. We explained to him that we didn't eat it because it didn't taste fresh and was too dry. His response was, \"I have to charge you something extra at lease $5 because you didn't finish the sushi. And if you didn't like it then you should have told me something.\" I don't understand how we can tell him if we don't like something when he isn't around. He also has the manager/owner come by and say the same thing. Apparently at this place if you don't like your food you get charged extra.",

Lots of ppl In the dining room came in parties of 6 or more which left no space for smaller parties.    Luckily a table opened up for us. We ordered a bunch of specialty rolls. Including  XS roll,  Sweet heart roll, Las Vegas Roll, Amazing tuna, Manhattan roll, Angry dragon roll. Volcano roll   A lot of variations had imitation crab meat, mango, cream cheese, avocado or tempura  The Standouts has to be XS roll & Sweet heart roll   Las Vegas roll was a fried sushi with cream cheese and Volcano roll was similar with more sriracha decorations we wished we had gotten instead sashimi which was very fresh and was served with thick slices  Best sashimi: salmon, tuna           Nigiri: eel, salmon roe   Cons: There is a long wait for the sashimi and servers sometimes get orders mixed up, understaffed   Pros: fresh sashimi, price, generous portions.

The service is decent but can get VERY slow once there are a few full tables.  The BIGGEST area of concern is the fact that there was a LIVE ROACH in the hallway right outside of the kitchen AND another one inside the women's bathroom. This is unacceptable in a restaurant and should be taken care of. Definitely not sure if they would pass a health inspection. That is the last time I will be eating there.",

    "text": "Going here twice in a week is what I call worth it!!! As in $11.99 to eat all the sushi you want during lunch from 11am to 4pm. I mean seriously, if you are planning to spend more than $12 for sushi, you need to come here. It is definitely a \"Your money's worth\" situation! Two specialty rolls at other restaurants cost more than this.  It's all you can eat on anything from appetizers such as shrimp tempura, seaweed salad to dessert such as fried bananas and green tea ice cream. You also have chicken, beef, salmon cutlet, ramen, udon, maki rolls, hand rolls, nigiri pieces and so on. The drinks do cost extra money though. I usually stick with water.  The pieces are decently made and they are not overstuffed with rice. I'm glad the owners are respecting the customers in that regard. The fish is decently fresh as well. So for moderate pricing and decent sushi that is way worth your money, you need to come to Akita.  I think I ate about 30-40 pieces of sushi every time I went not including the seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, miso soup, friend bananas and other random things. You can also order their specialty rolls which include Las Vegas, Manhattan, Rainbow and 3 other specialty rolls. Usually I always eat about 6-10 salmon nigiri pieces first because salmon is just that good. :)  This place is awesome, but it could use more than 2 waitress since everything is made to order (not buffet style) and then brought to your table. I also had several instances where they just forgot what I ordered and didn't bring it. Or they got the order itself wrong on certain sushi pieces. They could put more specialty rolls on their menu too.",

There were the sushi chefs standing behind the sushi bar just staring at us, not doing anything and they still didn't bother to let staff know that they should probably come over to seat us. We had to walk over to them and ask if they were going to seat us or not.  When we got seated, our waitress spoke horrible broken English and we had a hard time understanding each other. Not to mention she had the voice level of a mouse. We kept asking her to speak up and no matter how hard she \"tried\" it was next to impossible to hear her. She also didn't come around during our entire meal to refill any of our drinks.   Besides the service, the food was pretty good. Sushi rolls were flavorful, udon soup was just Ok, tempura was super oily, sashimi was good. Menus are hard to read as they're all scratched up and the pictures and words are almost no longer visible. We had to ask for different menus which, honestly, weren't that much better.   Oh, the bathrooms look like caves and have a marble type waterfall as the sink faucets...#EXTRA.",

    "text": "Prologue: My girlfriend and I are sushi fans and we're always on the lookout for something new and different. Generally speaking, I've found that the quality of all-you-can-eat sushi is usually acceptable and it's significantly more economical for me that a la carte. On the other hand, my girlfriend's sushi dining experiences in this part of the Phoenix Metro area have been limited to just one conveyor belt restaurant (see our review of Teharu Sushi on 10/21/16). So, an online search of all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants yielded some good reviews for Akita and we decided to give it a try.  The Plot: One of the best parts about all-you can eat is that you get to try lots of different items from the menu. My girlfriend and I shared several salads and appetizers, including Seaweed Salad, Avocado Salad, Salmon Teriyaki, Aged Tofu, and Fried Scallops. Our Nigiri selections included Masago, Tobiko, Red Clam, Mackerel, Tuna, Yellow Tail, and Salmon. The Maki rolls we tried included, Tuna, Eel Avocado, Sweet Potato Tempura, Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Crispy Onion, Manhattan, Kanpyo, and Gold. We wrapped things up with a taste of each of the desserts, which included Fried Bananas, Mango Sorbet, Green Tea Ice Cream, and Vanilla Ice Cream.  The Scene: We both agreed that the number and variety of menu items exceeded any of our previous experiences at this type of restaurant in southern Arizona. Overall the quality of the food was 3 stars and consistent with, and in some cases better than, what you would expect from a lunchtime all-you-can-eat sushi buffet. The salad and appetizer highlights for us were the Seaweed Salad, which was a good as we've had anywhere, the Salmon Teriyaki, which was very tasty, properly cooked, with good salmon flavor and not too much teriyaki flavor, and the Aged Tofu, which was interesting, different, and a much preferred alternative to Natto. The quality of the Nigiri was all as good as one would expect in this setting and my girlfriend was pleased with the portion sizes; however none of the items we ordered really stood out. We truly enjoyed all of the Maki rolls; the Manhattan was the most visually impressive, the Spicy Crispy Onion was new, different, and definitely worth a try, and the Kanpyo was the most traditional and also a new one for both of us.  The Rest of the Story: We thought it was noteworthy that all of the rolls can be ordered either as Maki or Temaki and all of the noodle dishes can be ordered either as Udon or Soba. Over the several courses we ordered I noticed that the quality of the rice varied. Sometimes it was warm with a nice texture and proper seasoning and at others it was a little cold, a little chewy, and consequently had less flavor. The Avocado Salad was okay but was essentially a waste of time; there are few other salads on the menu that are much better.  Epilogue: The main ingredient that raised our review from 3 to 4 stars was the price. It's safe to say you will not find a more economical lunchtime sushi option anywhere considering the variety and quality of the food. We are definitely planning to return to experience their more extensive dinner time menu. The service was prompt and courteous, all of our orders arrived fairly quickly, and my girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, enjoyed chatting with the chefs at the bar, all of whom are from China and spoke Mandarin.

Not only does the interior surpass expectation, the sushi, service and price point were all very good!  $12 for lunch and $20 for dinner for good quality fish and AYCE- someone pinch me I'm dreaming!   I started with nigiri, typically I go with Sashimi to evaluate how good a sushi place is as it shows the quality of their product without the smoke and mirrors. The nigiri were portioned well, fresh fish/seafood and the rice was great. My biggest pet peeve with sushi is cold, over or undercooked sushi rice. The nigiri was on the money.  What I ordered: Nigiri: Tuna, Salmon, Red Snapper (Tai), Shrimp, Mackerel, Yellowtail, White Tuna, Red Clam, Masago, Tobiko   All were good, though I did not enjoy the Masago, Tobiko or Mackerel as they left more to be desired.  Rolls: Eel Avocado Roll & Tuna these were simple and yummy, came with 6 pieces  Fried: Shrimp Tempura, Calamari Ring and Fried Banana (with honey)  They do tempura very well here, crisp and light! Pass on the calamari, the shrimp is amazing! I did the fried bananas with green tea ice cream and found the bananas good, but a bit greasy and the green tea was too artificial and tasted overly floral.  I love the fact that there's no limit per order- as long as you don't waste. Also it's awesome that they do single item orders, so you can try a little bit of everything here. I'm excited to come back to try more of their appetizers, rolls and nigiri. The ramen they have here I would pass on as they come in small bowls in simple ramen broth and straight noodles.",

We were greeted and brought drinks fast and once we ordered our first round of food we got it quickly.   The quality is good for the price, better than most places. There is more fish than rice on the sushi rolls and nigiri, and they even offer sashimi on the AYCE dinner menu! The salmon and tuna sashimi was great, fresh and large pieces. Others in our party ordered the fried rice and chicken teriyaki. The chicken was flat (more of a cutlet or pounded out) and could have used more sauce but the taste was still good. They offer so many options on the AYCE dinner menu that there is easily something for everyone. Highly recommend and we will be back!",

I like variety and hate the anxiety of ordering $10-15 sushi per roll at other restaurants.  Oh sure, they may have the most divine fish but in the end, if I want more I'd have to pay for it.  Here I can try different things all for one price and not worry about a $100 bill later.  Anxiety free eating is what a \"buffet\" is meant for.  If I want the best quality and burn a hole in my wallet, I'd go Yasu Sushi Bistro but here is good comfort every day food with excellent service.   If you haven't, try the specialty rolls.  I did love the sweet heart roll and I'm not the kind of person who likes over doneup sushi.",

If you're looking for a lot of sushi, nigiri, tempura, teriyaki, etc. for an incredibly reasonable price (that yung $14 lunch special), look no further. I almost didn't want to write this review so I could keep this sushi mecca somewhat underground, but I gotta give the people what they want. You're welcome, people. Cancel your plans, slip into your sweats with the stretchy waistband, and buckle in for the ride.   If you're a sushi snob perhaps you may look down on the sushi quality, but I think for your average Joe-san it's more than satisfactory -- it's some of the best sushi I've had in this price range and all you can eat. They have a wide variety of common rolls (you can also get them as hand rolls, which are kind of like one large piece of sushi in the form of a seaweed basket); I'm personally a fan of the spicy tuna and the eel and avocado, but I would stay away from the crab. Specialty rolls are also great, and their Crazy Volcano Roll is just the right amount of fried -- I think the Las Vegas Roll is fried a little too heavily.  Make sure you visit the bathroom (just do it -- top tier bathroom, and trust me I know bathrooms) and get the green tea ice cream!",

I wanted to leave right then and there but as soon as I got back to my table the appetizers were there. The avocado salad that I ordered had an eyelash stuck to the side of the bowl. I pointed It out to the waiter, who quickly took It back to counter. I watched as he dug is finger into the bowl to retrieve the hair, wait around and tried to give It back to me. Hell no. I gave It back and told him that I didn't want It. Nigiri came out and fish was warmer than room temperature. That is a food hazard for sure. Not worth the risk even for 13 bucks. Di beware",

    "text": "First time here, currently writing the review as we are waiting for the remainder of our meal. Writing this review on behalf of my aunt who traveled long ways to visit. Sushi is really good here, but the service and our waiter was not. He asked if it was our first time here and we nodded yes. My mom and I ordered a la carte instead of \"all you can eat\" because our appetite wasn't up to par, and my aunt ordered all you can eat. Once the waiter brought out our sushi, my aunt asked if he can bring us a few sauces and then I followed asking if he can please bring us the soy sauce dish for the since they weren't already on the table, and he rudely rolled his eyes. 1 - I am extremely grateful and appreciative every time I go out to eat, 2 - I am a generous tipper unless service is trash. My aunt didn't even want to tip. Once she got her first round of sushi, he kind of didn't come back so that we wouldn't ask him for anything.   My order: The spicy tuna was fresh and spicy just like I like it. My avocado cream cheese roll with jalapeno was obnoxious. They threw in a large chunk of jalapeno inside which I've never seen done before. I took them out and had a huge hole in my sushi.   My aunt's order: avocado salad definitely not as pictured and her salmon jalapeno roll also included abnormally large chunk of jalapeno. Luckily it wasn't spicy.   I may consider giving this place another try, however, servers should do a better job at welcoming new comers. We really didn't even ask for much. My family almost didn't leave a tip because they were so turned off by the hospitality received, however, I convinced them to leave something. Probably not much though (not my decision).",

So paper thin. * avoid the beef teriyaki & chicken teriyaki.  Same reason.  Paper thin. * thought we ordered the unagi avocado rolls but when the rolls arrived, didn't resemble unagi or taste like unagi.  As we were leaving, we looked at what other folks were eating - how come their food looked better than ours did?  Hubby & bro in law both had the tempura udon noodles.  Looked like the noodles came out of a package.  But they both enjoyed the udon.  Easy parking lot.",

    "text": "AKITA IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE SUSHI AND BUFFET JOINT ( and one of my all-time favorite places to eat)!  I've been enjoying dining here for over a year and  Every time I have had the most enjoyable & delectable experience! They always make me feel like family & at home!  With cultural decor, extremely kind and considerate employees and delicious, high quality, nourishing fish and food, they do not disappoint! The managers and owners there are amazing and it shows through the quality of the facility & staff! Major kudos to them!   Fast service with a unique business set up which prevents wasted food which I highly respect! It is a maid to order buffet meaning, you order food and then they make it. This is an awesome concept considering how wasteful people are with food in the states! If you are wasteful with your ordering you will have to pay for large left overs but I think that's a great incentive to not waste nor disrespect the company and other patrons opportunity to eat.    Sushi rolls are traditionally  \"Asian\" sized unlike giant Americanized sushi rolls. When they get busy they have secondary servers that come by quickly just to drop off food while your personal server will come and check up on you, if they are really busy and I need something, I wave at one of the attendants and they always quickly assist.  Yvonne Is not only my favorite server but her heart and kindness transcend into the rest of my day, beautifying my life with her uplifting, bright, insightful, helpful & loving spirit! She always makes our time there more enjoyable and we look forward to see her when we go, she is truly one of the major reasons we love eating here!   I highly recommend Akita, affordable & delicious! A real gem in the desert!",

Amazing. Overall quality of the fish was acceptable, not fishy but not super high quality either. The rice needs work. I'm pretty sure it's unseasoned sticky rice. No flavor.   Good variety of hot foods and sushi on the menu. My son had a bunch of gyoza and the udon. Don't get the tempura udon. The tempura was two fried sticks of imitation crab. Scarfed them down but not good. The tempura shrimp was thick breading with small shrimp.   Overall a good deal for AYCE sushi that is pretty hard to come by in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I'm hesitantly giving Akita sushi only three stars because I really desire to award them four.  However based on our total dining experience (food quality, selection, cleanliness, service and wait times) I must in all honesty deliver only three stars, primarily based on the extremely long wait and inaccuracy of our order.  When it did finally arrive to our table the food itself was pretty good, considering this is an AYCE sushi restaurant and comparing it against other identical establishments.  A 20 to 30 minutes delay from the time we placed our order to the time it physically arrived on our table seems a tad too long compared to other similar dining venues we've had.  Additionally, a few items we ordered did not show up at all.  We spoke to our server about this and he apologized for the mix up, finally bringing our ika nigiri and Las Vegas rolls towards the end of our meal.  The slow arrival of our dinner items could be attributed to a very busy and totally unexpected Sunday evening the day before July 4th.  I was told normally Sunday evenings are fairly quiet according to the staff however it appears the volume of customers this evening caught them off guard.  It was so busy the owner \"Sam\" who was off that day had come in to help the other sushi chiefs meet the demand.  But this speaks a great deal of Sam's dedication to his customers.  They have a pretty good selection of items from the sushi variety to the appetizers and hot foods.  Our server \"Brian\" was awesome.  He was very attentive, always mindful and filling our water, iced and/or hot green tea glasses without having to be asked even though he was busier than a one legged man in a butt kicking contest.  His temperament was exactly what you'd want and expect in a server, a friendly demeanor with a nice smile every time he interacted with us.  Brain apologized often for the long wait and provided an acceptable reason for the delay.    We used the long delay productively catching up with one another in good conversations and showing one another photos and videos from our phones.  Thank God for technology effectively filling in the gap.  Overall we were quite satisfied and happy with our dining experience and will be going back in the future at which time I'm hoping to be able to increase their rating to four or possibly five stars.  And at $21 per person its a great deal.  Here's a few tips for future diners to be mindful of:  1.  The nigiri style sushi is only one piece per order (traditionally served in two pieces) however you can order as many as you want.  2.  The sashimi is also limited to one piece per order but once again you can order as many as you desire.  3.  There is no tako (octopus) on the menu.  4.  The makizushi (rolled) sushi are smaller than normal which is cut into six small pieces.  5.  They do and will charge you for any wasted food. This is a very good practice as it keeps the cost down for the restaurant which in turn is passed on to you, the customer.",

Sushi, appetizers, fried rice, noodles, dessert.   You order appetizers, nigiri and sashimi  by the piece. Their specialty rolls were okay. Nothing was extraordinary. And there was eel sauce on many of them.   We tried the seafood ramen too. It was meh.   The staff was super friendly and were good at describing what was in the rolls. But def try to sell each one as really tasty lol. The waitress told me the sweet potato roll was so good it tasted like meat..... Hahhahaa. Um. It was ok, but def did not taste like meat....",

Anyways, Totally recommend the place, You'll definitely enjoy it and I know for sue I'm going there again.   Cheers!",

More rice than fish, and rice was hard. 2. With the exception of the sashimi, all the fish came out room temperature. I expect my rice warm and fish cold. Knowing this is raw, eating it room temperature was very concerning... 3. Certain fish tasted old. Spicy tuna and salmon rolls definitely were dry and felt like they've been sitting around.  Pros: 1. There is all you can eat sashimi, which is decent quality. Very rare to find an AYCE that will offer that. 2. Decent prices... We're used to paying $26+ for dinner, so not bad. 3. Service was polite and prompt, although not enthusiastic.  Good for a sushi craving, but definitely not the best around.",

    "text": "The rating is for the quality of the food. This sushi here is hands down the worst sushi I ever had. The quality of the fish is horrific. All the rolls and nagiri came out dry and devoid of flavor. It was obviously old. Verrry old. The spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail was extremely dry and had the texture of sand. The salmon pieces were so old that it looks more grey than orange. Everything here is not fresh. Not even close! The miso soup was also terrible and also so salty that its impossible to finish it. Instead, I used it to hide some of the inedible sushi pieces I couldn't finish.   Ohhh.... and the water sucked too. Tasted like tap water with the chemical aftertaste.   One thing that WAS good though was the shrimp tempura. It was warm and pretty tasty.   I guess the reason for the high reviews is because it offers cheap AYCE. Prices for lunch AYCE rose to 12.99 from 11.99. They also don't have muscles anymore. If you want to eat alot of shitty food for cheap then this place is the place for you. Otherwise, any single roll at any other sushi restaurants is better than anything this place offers.",

I can understand as they have to have a certain amount of customers for the revolving to make sense.   Instead they had all you can eat off the menu which covers a lot of ground. Sushi and other traditional items. For the price it's a good value.  Had shrimp tempura appetizers. Quite good...small shrimp but crispy and well prepared. Wife had the pork cutlet appetizer also and it was tasty.  Dived into the sushi. Surprisingly they had yellowtail on the sushi menu which is one of our favorites. Also had white tuna, masago, spicy tuna, mackerel and red clam. They are a tad heavy on the rice but standard for an all you can eat place.  Wife liked the yellow tail and we had two or three more orders. The eel avocado roll is good also.  I went back to the shrimp tempura a few more times. I liked it. Nice crispness.   Finished off with fried banana and green tea ice cream.  Overall good value and I should be back. After I lose the weight gained here...  Oh and you have to go check the restrooms out!",

I got sat down at a table and got handed a menu and I didn't see prices for the food so it had me really confused on the menu it didn't say it was $13+ for all you can eat. (Not a bad price) but I literally had no clue the prices. Being that it was my first visit there they should have asked me if I've been in before because I wasn't familiar with the menu and so I ordered a few rolls and the were only so so. There are other places in the neighborhood that are a lot better on the food quality and more friendly. I may give this establishment another chance but not anytime soon.",

Most all-you-can-eat places are either buffet or have a very limited menu.  Not Akita Sushi.  Special rolls included; a beer deal for buy one, get your second for a penny; a great variety of food even beyond sushi (tempura, ramen, fried rice and more) makes this place a great deal!  If I only lived closer, I could see becoming a serious regular as my whole family loves sushi and this place would make going out for dinner with five hungry kids actually affordable!  I recommend the spicy tuna hand roll-- delicious!-- although the soup and salad were a little too salty and sweet, respectively.  All the other dishes, however-- dumplings and spring rolls and sushi and more (oh my!)-- were delightful.  Portion size makes you mindful about choosing what to eat, and the fact that you can have as much as you want is pure indulgence.  Yum!",

Sat patiently and waited and waited then noticed that I was the only patron left at about 1:30PM.  A couple arrived and sat several seats away from me, ordered off the menu and got their food before I did.  When they received their food I overheard them talking that they did not order one of the items.  It sat for a while in front of them while the staff tried to figure out what was going on - again only two patrons in the place.  This item ended up being the appitizer I ordered, now cold, and since I had already started eating the sushi I ordered I did not want the item so nicely refused it.    They offered to make me a new one which was nice but how could you miss serving a dish when only two tables in the place??  No, thanks -  Food was good - service was slow - staff was nice and apologetic but left a bad taste in my mouth.  Might try again but all in all was not really impressed.  The revolving sushi was interesting but since I had plenty of time to sit and wait for my order wondered how long it had been revolving -",

We were very disappointed to hear that sashimi was not even on the menu.  A single serving of teriyaki salmon was 1 maybe 2 ounces at the most.  The rainbow roll had the thinnest slices of fish on it that I have ever seen. The fish in the spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls seemed to be heavily cut with a filler such as Panko. The TINY chunks of fish that we managed to find in the other rolls did not taste very fresh.  To add insult to injury we noticed two employees eating at one of the booths as we left.  They had two big plates of salmon and shrimp with NO rice!!!  What a kick in the groin. We won't be going back.",

The price here for the AYCE is PHENOMENAL: $12 for lunch, $20 for dinner. Their AYCE menu's have a pretty good selection: soup, salad, kitchen items such as fried things and noodles/rice, regular rolls, nigiri sushi, and special rolls. There are also a few options for dessert.  I tried a variety of things like the shrimp tempura, fried scallops, multiple regular and special rolls, and nigiri. All were pretty decent with the Manhattan Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Shrimp Tempura being the stars. The fried scallops were disappointing as they were just pollock in the shape of scallops that were fried. The Nigiri were on the iffy side to me as the fish was VERY room temperature, to an almost uncomfortable point. They were also quite heavy on the rice. I would also avoid the deep fried rolls as they were low on feeling and on the heavy side in terms of rice as well. They offer Ice Cream in a few flavors as well as Deep Fried Bananas for dessert. I had the Ice Cream and it was pretty standard.  All in all, this place is absolutely great for the price. The selection and service are also great but one should beware of certain items on the menu.",

We passed by Akita on our way, and saw the \"all you can eat\", so we decided to try there.  We were seated immediately, and our food came out just as quick.  We are from Southern Cal and really expected excellent sushi, and WE GOT IT.  The rolls were very flavorful and varied.  Definitely worth the price, and all of it was really fresh, even as it was towards closing.  Would recommend this place to all!",

Order a \"crab roll\" and what comes in it? Crab. That's it. No cucumber, avocado, or anything else. I'm a big fan of cheap sushi but I also like it to be pretty decent with maybe a few veggies in the roll. I would recommend a Teharu type rotating place over this if you want cheap sushi. At least they put more than one ingredient in their rolls.",

Once you walk in, you are received in a friendly manner and seated according to preference. I always enjoy sitting at the sushi bar. The waiters are prompt and courteous. The best part is the quality and presentation of the food. The sushi chefs are amazing. Presentations are appealing. The food itself, fresh and expertly prepared. I ordered 10 small plates (1 pc each, except for a special roll). From the appetizers to the nigiri, sashimi, hand rolls, and house special rolls, they were all excellent. Everything was so delectable, I had to resist ordering more. It is an all-you-can-eat menu, but they ask -and courtesy requires - that you only order what you can consume. I've been there a few times already and the service and food quality have been consistently great. I will definitely go again.",

Nothing wrong with that :-) i sampled several appetizers: gyoza (good), aged tofu (fresh out of the fryer, could use some salt), ans miso soup (actually just a tiny bit of broth...). Then i had the spicy salmon roll, that was interesting, taste and texture were not right, but the spicy tuna was decent. Not the best ever, but good. Then I handed in the next slip for one more roll and dessert.... The ice cream came before the roll or the  fried banana, green tea ice cream didn't taste like green tea. Kind of a weird sweet flavor. Vanilla ice cream with a little matcha mixed in, maybe? Tuna avocado roll was good when it came. Fresh tuna, equally sized piece of avocado, sea weed, and rice. The fried banana arrived last... Also fresh from the fryer and piping hot. And absolutely delicious!!! So for ayce but prepared to order sushi, this place is great. I'll be coming back.... But first I have to find someone to roll me out to my car :-D lol",

The sushi chef and owner also came to our table to ask if we needed anything else that is service.  Now from the servers some are good and some are not.  The good thing is that you can wave down any of the server and they will be happy to help you out.    The best thing about this restaurant is that they you don't have to just have sushi or sashimi all that you can eat, but also have a wide selection of other items such as tempura, ramen, fried rice, and salads (squid, seaweed, or regular).    Conclusion, as for the distance from me, I would take the 40 min drive to go to this restaurant again and again,  I liked the personal attention from the owner (sushi chef)  They do have a reservation online that you can do and 20 buck for all that you can eat.  You can't beat that.  They only down side is that when it is busy you may have to wait to be seated, but that is expected.   The bathroom is awesome, which is weird to say.  Wait till you see it.",

As, we went to the eating establishment not knowing it was all you can eat we ask the owner/manager if we could order from the menu in which case he indicated that we could. After having to almost trip the server to order and also receive our bill we were charged for a full all you can eat meals with only ordering 2 rolls and the server never even ask when and if we wanted anything else. Besides, the horrible service the food was sub par to say the least. I have never seen such small and stale tasting sushi. There is a great sushi restaurant down the road that is always packed. I'm sure the only reason this place has ANY business is overflow from the great place. When I told the manage/ owner that we would pay $40 for our meal he refused to give us back our credit card. I had no choice but to call the Scottsdale police when the owner started to yell and act obstinate to my 80 year old Mother. Very poor food and service. I am SURE they will be out of business quickly as nobody in Scottsdale is going to put up with either horrible service and awful stale fish. Which was slight in the rolls.",

I went for a lunch on a Saturday with my daughter, the food was good as usual when I noticed a lot of movement next to me. I ignored it at first as a shadow then looked again and about came unhinged! There was the biggest black roach I'd ever seen! I jumped out of my booth and stood away from my booth. Some of the wait staff noticed but ignored me. I debated on what to do as I didn't want to cause a commotion but wanted them to tKe care of it. My daughter is a chef at a restaurant in town and even though it happens in the best eateries, couldn't believe the size of the roach. I finally got the manager's attention and told him what happened he went and made a show of looking and when I told him which way it went he just shrugged & asked if I wanted to move. I said of course I do & they moved us to another table. I couldn't eat anything else & we asked for the bill. Throughout this neither he nor our server ever said sorry or much of anything. They didn't offer to discount my lunch, offer anything to calm me down. Will not ever be back!!! In fact as we sat there, as if to show how much they disbelieved what I was saying they actually sat people in the booth behind mine even though there were plenty of places in other parts of the restaurant. Worst customer service ever!!!",

Our server was extremely attentive & friendly, & even the manager came by to make sure everything was good.  This is definitely a hidden gem in Scottsdale. I would not expect this kind of service, nor quality, AND get this kind of a steal! Will definitely be a regular.  The Sweet Heart roll is delicious, & the classics are whats to be expected. Our Las Vegas roll with added miso sauce made this classic roll more savory & creamy than your regular old LV Roll.   I recommend the green tea ice cream to end the night :)",

    "text": "Akita Sushi is an All You Can Eat Sushi establishment, and it is perhaps the best one I have ever been to in terms of value. The value is incredible, and the amount of options available is amazing. I believe the prices vary depending on which day of the week you visit, but it's always extremely reasonable for an AYCE made to order sushi joint. If you come hungry, you will leave very happy and very bloated.   The sushi is made to order, and there are lots of rolls to choose from, including some premium rolls that would be quite pricey at an average sushi place. The sushi itself isn't amazing by any sense, but it's decent enough, and it certainly gets the job done. You can also choose from other items such as tempura, soup, salad and dessert as part of the All You Can Eat menu. Like I said, the amount of options available is insane. Even people who don't like sushi will find something.  The service is quick, the staff is fantastic, and they NEVER give you any angry or disgruntled looks after you eat 9 rolls of sushi or however many you can fit inside your gut. Not only is this an ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi place with an amazing selection and acceptable quality, this is also a judgement-free zone. Phenomenal.   If you're looking for very high-quality sushi, Akita Sushi is not for you. There is much \"better\" sushi to be found. Please understand that. But if you're looking for decent-quality sushi at a great price, and you want to eat as much as you can with no restrictions whatsoever, Akita Sushi is absolutely a dream come True. It is one of the best restaurants in terms of value I have ever been to.   Akita Sushi gets 5 stars, and it is one of the easier 5 stars I have ever given. If you're ready to stuff your face with sushi, your search is over.",

The service was good, but the food overrides any positive points they might get for service. The rolls are chopped up fish and filler. I have no idea what the filler is, but we were unable to distinguish between the spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail rolls. The waiter did not even know which one was which!!! The nigiri have tiny, thin, tasteless pieces of fish on them. The sauces on the rolls are just sweet, no other flavor. And the seaweed salad had this thick, green slime on it, similar to snot.",

Most all-you-can-eat places have crappy little rolls and limit how many specialty rolls you can order - but not this place! I also love that they include appetizers, salads, soups and desserts on their all-you-can-eat menu, and you can order as little or as much as you want. This allows you to try a variety of different things without overindulging and for a great price.   The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because the service can be quite slow when they are busy and they may forget to bring out part of your order all together! However, they do somewhat make up for this by allowing you to order as many rounds of food as you want.",

It's a great place for reasonably priced sushi and Japanese food.  My personal favorite is the teriyaki eggplant.    The all you care to eat arrangement is a nice treat for sushi because you don't have the price of every roll in the back of your mind as you're dining.  For the price of a couple rolls elsewhere you receive a full meal here.   I recommend it for a casual/quick (by sushi standards) evening out.",

Which was 4/5.    *THIS IS AN ALL YOU CAN EAT PLACE; SO IF YOU DON'T EAT IT YOU PAY FOR LEFTOVERS*  - sorry you'd be surprised how many people don't get this concept.    Pros: *Good Quality Sushi *Customizable  *Huge selection *All you can eat - not buffet style though *Decently Priced *Drink Specials *Good Atmosphere  Cons: *Every blue moon you have someone just learning english (just bare with them - it isn't an easy language to learn).   *Listening to _____  people not understanding the concept of all you can eat which means you pay full price for leftovers.  Then complaining about it yet, it says it right on the menu.  Seriously, who doesn't know you can't take leftovers at all you can eat places.  *Hot Green Tea isn't that good - which I am happy to deal with due to all the positives. However, I'd be happy to pay more for some quality green tea.    I feel like I am a regular there.  I love it.  The quality is good ( I only have had rolls, sushi and nigiri).  They don't over pack it with rice.  You can customize your rolls.  They have great drink specials.  I don't know how there isn't a wait to get into this place.  Some of the servers are learning English so bare with them they really are trying very hard!  They have a lot of options on the menu and are decently priced!   I don't know what else to say about it, besides it is a must try if you like rolls & sushi.",

Let me explain:  1) We entered a quantity by a certain line item and it was not keyed into the system.  Had to ask again nearly 3-5 times on two items when not delivered.   2) We entered something on the sushi card and it did not match to what was brought out.  Happened a few times.    3) We entered something on the sushi card and it was not available in their stock.  Rather then coming back to us and reconfirming after that was noted, they just did not bring it out.  We only found out at the end when we started wondering where certain menu item was.    Otherwise, the quality of the sushi is good.  They need to start paying more attention to what is entered on the sushi card (both sides of the sushi card), and make sure they are entered.  They also need to let the customer know if there are any issues.",

Here's a big one (especially for me and anyone who knows I review based on this perspective), it is GREAT for vegetarians! There are many different kinds of sushi rolls you can get there (the avocado roll, avocado cucumber roll, sweet potato roll = ones I get), you can also get the spring rolls, miso soup (no fish stock or chicken broth), the veggie tempura, they have an udon dish. Basically, there are a lot of options you can get as a vegetarian, and there's also tons of options for your friends who might not follow that dietary preference! A perfect place for mixed dietary needs/preferences to get together and hang out!  I personally try and starve myself half the day before I come here so I can enjoy as much food as possible. It is good quality food and very enjoyable. I have not gotten sick here once! (Well, except for when I eat too much.) Their desserts are also very good! I like the mango ice cream!  I would recommend this to anyone! It is a place great for a date or great for groups! Either way, bring some company and eat some food!",

Even better their lunch price is 15$ for all you can eat and I don't see how you can beat that. We have been here about 5 times and the rolls are consistently great and the service is always great. They are very attentive with refilling waters which I think everyone can appreciate when you are stuffing face with rolls. The ambience is great, very clean, and great decor.

    "text": "I have had sushi from all over and when I moved to Arizona I thought I would have to give it up, because no ocean of course so how fresh can fish possibly be.   The service: Let me start by saying that I have never been for dinner, I have only gone for the all you can eat lunch special which is fantastically priced. There have been days where it is moderately busy and days that it is not, but regardless, the service has always been prompt and kind. I have been seeing the same two waiters there for a year & 1/2 now. Drinks are always full and the sushi comes out fairly fast depending on how busy the restaurant is.   The food: I would say I like about 80% of the menu on an off day. If you know fish texture you know that most kinds aren't supposed to be chewy or firm. I have been over a dozen times and there have been a couple times where the texture was pretty off and it's usually with the salmon because they don't have really fatty salmon. The yellowtail, tuna & mackerel have always been a safe bet. I have not liked anything fried, the calamari in particular because it is very chewy. Because I have gone so many times I have figured out the best bets for me that I can't get enough of: spicy yellowtail roll, sweetheart roll, yellowtail & mackerel sashimi/sushi.   Overall: Everyone has a variety to what they like in regards to raw fish. Going to their amazing lunch special is one way to find out what you can and can't get of your favorites. There are plenty of options for those that don't like sushi, and for those that just want to branch out and try new things, one little plate at a time. As many times as I have gone, it is still getting only 4 stars because of the fish quality off days and sloppy plating here and there. I have figured out what I love from there and I will keep going, every, single, time, that I'm in the valley because it's the best I've found in the state so far.",

    "text": "Love this place and go pretty often especially since the price is so good. It's 14$ for all you can eat lunch any day of the week and 22$ for dinner!  The sushi is actually pretty good and there's a TON of options other than sushi (udon, chicken, beef, rice, etc).  If you go for dinner it's more expensive but there's rolls with better ingredients (crab, lobster, etc).  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you put an order in and most of your order will come but you have to remember what you order because they'll bring the rest out when you think you're done and you have to pay for what you don't eat.   They only do AYCE so keep that in mind but overall awesome place! - highly recommend",

    "text": "So... for the price, this place rocks!!!  Was VERY impressed with the extremely extensive menu and how it's set up. We came in, we're greeted immediately and were sat at a booth. The restaurant and restrooms were VERY clean (very important). My friend told me you must go into the bathroom! She was right, it's a cool and unique touch!   They give you several copies of their huge  \"All You Can Eat\" paper menu. You mark what you want and they bring it to your table!  Just be sure you don't order too much or else you pay full price for what is left, so it's better to order a decent amount the first round and order lighter after.  Some of the items you order per piece, like the tempura veggies, sashimi's, hand rolls, etc. which I loved!!! My son and I were able to try soooo many different things. Loved the miso soup, the Las Vegas Roll, Tuna sashimi, spicy tuna roll and their tuna mango roll. The crab puffs were not worth the calories and the hand rolls had a Lot of rice, but were beautiful. Tried several tempura veggies which were all delicious and we were VERY surprised by the seaweed salad, it was perfection! For dessert we tried the honey bananas, chocolate bananas, Butter pecan ice cream and vanilla ice cream. The honey bananas were definitely our favorite, the rest were just OK.  Was so good we came back a few days later for my son's bday dinner and had the green tea ice cream. That was pretty good!!!",

    "text": "$21.99 for AYCE dinner sushi. This includes sashimi and some extra special rolls. I loved being able to order a ton of different stuff. Our waiter was very understanding as we ate our way through the menu.   I'm a big fan of the fact that they give you small portions of everything, so you can taste it without wasting food. Then you can just order a ton of your favorite, which in our case was salmon sashimi and white tuna. I wish they gave you half portions of special rolls (maybe 4 pieces instead of 8) so that you could try more variety.   First Round: Eggplant teriyaki, chicken yakitori, calamari tempura, salmon, white tuna, red snapper and mackerel sashimi, salmon avocado roll and Akita roll.   Second round: Fire Dragon Roll, five more slices of salmon sashimi, Angry Dragon, age tofu, shrimp tempura.   Third round: Four slices of salmon sashimi, three of white tuna, three of red snapper, three unagi nigiri. We are flagging at this point.   Fourth round (dessert): Green tea ice cream, mango ice cream, and fried banana. Green tea ice cream was by far my favorite. The mango ice cream was a bit watery and the fried banana was mostly breading.  If I were to go again, I would eat mostly salmon, white tuna, and red snapper. I would completely skip the hand rolls and go straight for the special rolls, probably go for the rainbow roll and out of control roll.   I would go there again if I wanted affordable sushi.",

I am a fan!!!  You got to try this out if you are looking for fantastic ayce sushi.   Young, one of the owners personally ensured that everyone dining in had a great experience, the service was very fast and I am definitely coming back.",

We have come here probably 10 times now and I always enjoy it. No it's not the highest quality sushi in Phoenix, but what do you expect? It's all you can eat. I never want to try new places when I come down to Phoenix because I just go to Akita sushi now. I love being stuffed after I leave. I love the spicy salmon and salmon sashimi. Try the yakitori, it's good. My favorite roll is the angry dragon roll, and the hand rolls are also really good here. It's worth a try if you go for dinner and when they're not too busy.",

    "text": "I use Yelp to read reviews and never to write them but I think my experience with this place deserves a very lengthy one. I've been coming to Akita for years, about once or twice a month on average. I'm a sucker for all you can eat sushi and theirs is pretty decent. Throughout all that time, I could stand to make the long trip and deal with the mediocre customer service because the food and the price still makes it worth it.  Put simply you come here for the sushi, not to make friends. I never cared that the floor manager didn't remember my name no matter how many times I come, or how the waiters never smile or ask me how I'm doing, or even remember that they've tended to me before. It's ok. ESL probably. I get it. I still tipped fairly, and I still kept coming back.   Then this all changed when I came here again with a group of friends. Our waitress was a lot colder than usual. It's the kind of coldness that makes you think they've got something else going on in their lives and they're taking it out on you that day. It's not just being cold, it's teetering dangerously into being outright hostile. There were about 10 of us and we ordered a lot. We all frequent this place and the waiters should be able to remember that, but I guess that didn't matter. This particular waitress would take your order but never acknowledged that she even heard you. She stares unbrokenly at her notepad, not bothering to make eye contact, nod her head, or tell you that she understood you.  She even brought down an item that none of us ever ordered and when we told her that it wasn't ours, she actually rolled her eyes and muttered a complaint before taking it back. My friends and I all looked at one another, wondering if we had done something to insult her.   This attitude persisted throughout the whole time that we were there. So at the end, when we all got our receipts separately, I decided to tip her 1 cent to give a message. I wanted to make sure that the establishment didn't just think I had forgotten to tip. Shortly after the receipts were collected, the manager came directly to our table and asked who the 1 cent tip came from. I said it was me.   I was thinking he probably wanted to at least ask me why I tipped the way I did. Was it a problem with the service? The food? Is there anything that he can do to make it up? You know like any sane rational manager would have done. My oh my how wrong was I. He basically just lost it and exploded at me. He didn't care to find out what was even wrong or to hear me out, he just came over with guns blazing. I responded by telling him he had a lot of nerve coming here and shaming me in front of all my friends when I had a perfectly good reason for tipping the way I did. After an intense shouting match, I left the place.   I was shocked and puzzled. Why did the manager immediately pounced on me as if he's trying to impress the waitress that he was \"defending\"? If he was this quick to anger and fight an actual customer, how does he usually treat his employees? This dude definitely has major temperament issue and should not be allowed to work anywhere near customers ever again. I work in customer service and if I'm even remotely this confrontational, I'll get canned immediately.  In short, I've never had anywhere close to a bad experience anywhere, than I had with Akita that day. The place is poorly run and if they don't have any problem losing a regular like me, they probably don't care at all about any customers. Don't keep feeding this god awful sushi dump. They don't deserve your money, not even a penny of it.",

The AYCE include appetizers, sashimi, specialty sushi rolls, teriyaki, tempuras, udon noodles, and dessert ice cream. Really, it's worth it.  I appreciate good sushi but I am definitely not super picky about the quality. With that said, the sushi rolls are pretty average but they have substance.

We were greeted promptly by who appeared to be the manager. Great number of booth seats available. We came in for the lunch AYCE, which was actually  decently priced at $15 per person. They gave us a small pencil with many slips of papers to put our orders. This was convenient compared to other AYCE sushi places I have eaten, where they would only give 3-4 rounds. One neat thing I noticed is that some of the appetizers can be ordered as 1 piece, like gyoza and zucchini tempura. This is really neat, as I jusr wanted to try a bit of everything.  Other things I have tried were the salmon teriyaki, chicken cutlet udon, pork cutlet, and beef fried rice. These entrees were not bad, but not the best in taste of course; the portion size was small, whoch was a good thing. Onto the sushi, we got a couple of rolls (limited to whatever the fish was, such as tuna roll, salmon roll, yellowtail roll, etc). These were not bad either,  but not something we expected much due to the cheap price.  In all, this is a good place to get really filled for a cheap price for Japanese cuisine. Thumbs up for their tempura selection and unlimited green tea ice cream scoops.",

    "text": "This place is a good place for lunch if you have a craving for sushi. Affordable and all the basics are there. Visited around 2ish pm and it was pretty full for lunchtime. They automatically gave me the ayce order slips (4) and a lunch menu when they seated me.  Food wasn't especially great but it was decent enough and enough variety for the price of an ayce lunch. A good bargain. For cooked dishes, I would skip the udon noodles, not especially good. I tried a few of the tempura appetizers and I liked the yam tempura. For appetizers, I'd skip the yakitori and cheese wontons. Sushi...decent but not great.  Basic sushi list, all there.  Favorite this meal...the Tamago sushi nigiri, never tried sweet egg before, was cold but sweet, which I liked.  Dislike...the vegas roll (is what I think it's called), never tried fried sushi before, didn't like it.   Dessert...the fried banana wasn't as good as I'd expected...loved the green tea ice cream.  Service...wasn't as bad as the reviews I've read but wasn't especially good either. I got a more \"matter-of-fact\" type service.  You needed your water refilled, flag them down when they're near or place your cup near the edge and they will automatically come over to refill your water when they see it when they make their rounds. You want to place your next food order, fill out your slip and place it near the edge of the table and they will grab it while they pass by. Little to no interaction or face emotion shown either. One small issue to me was that they don't pick up your emptied plates unless it hinders them placing your food down on the table. So my entire meal, I was stacking up my dishes to make room.  Summary... Decent food. Okay service.  Overall visit was good. I'd revisit. I'd recommend it if you don't really care too much about quality and just want to fill yourself up to the brim with sushi.",

Lunch all-you-can-eat pricing is around $15 a person. pricing is definitely good.  You get a menu and you get to choose what you want and they make the order on the spot. Which is definitely a plus instead of having it pre-made.  I don't really eat much of the raw stuff. So my favorite was the eel. Definitely recommend getting the hand rolls over the regular rolls. They don't skip out on the quantity. Also I had some tamago, which was okay. Shrimp and roll, shrimp tempura rolls were average.  I do like their seaweed salad, Garden salad was okay as well but was mainly cucumbers on top.  Fried scallop was also good as well, would pass on the Yakitori's.  Finished it with a green tea ice cream, which is pretty good. Not too sweet, but you will finish that one scoop and want a little more. But summer shredding.  Menu is pretty extensive especially if you like the raw stuff and they also have fried rice and udon noodles, but I was full already.   Menu does mentioned that you will get charged for food that you don't finish, so order what you can eat. Don't be greedy.   Service is pretty fast and friendly.  Decent parking lot outside.",

We got there around 3 and the staff immediately sat us and walked us through the process. The conveyor belt wasn't on, but that wasn't too surprising given the time of day. The menu is all you can eat from appetizer to dessert and the waitress said try anything you want just don't waste food. We did not think anything of this at first but then we noticed that the top left corner of the second page tells you that if you do not eat all of the food you will be charged accordingly. The food was great, everything was freshly cooked for us. We were able to try several rolls, appetizers, and desserts, and we enjoyed everything we tried. Our bill came out to $30 after taxes including two drinks. Can't beat it. My personal suggestion is to try the miso soup, gyoza, spicy salmon roll, volcano roll, and the deep fried bananas with green tea ice cream (it tasted like Fruity Pebbles!). Overall, a great experience, definitely the first of many for us.",

    "text": "I thought this place was really good for what it is: a quick and relatively cheap spot to stop in for a sushi meal. It's got a nice build-out, very clean, decent atmosphere, and efficient service. The sushi is good--it's not trying to get at the top end of sushi dining like some of the much more renowned, gourmet places in town, but for what it's trying to be the quality is good. The prices are the best part: everything is $2-3 below what you might pay elsewhere. Plates start at $1.50 and top out at $5.00.  The $2.00 and $3.00 plates are primarily nigiri, the $4.00 and $5.00 plates are rolls and sashimi. We were able to feed three of us quite well with several drinks for just $50, and we were in and out in well under an hour.  If you're short on time and want a relatively inexpensive sushi meal this is your spot.   I did see some other reviewers refer to a \"dirty dining\" news report from a couple months ago...they even gave bad reviews while admitting they didn't even go to the restaurant, which I think does review sites like Yelp a disservice. Anyway, I was aware of that report and reviewed it before we visited. I can say that having worked in restaurants and dealt with inspections before, the violations were all very minor, things like missing consumer warnings about raw food on the menu (which we all know anyway) and some minor labeling or employee training issues.  According to the health dept website all violations were corrected on re-inspection a couple weeks later. So, while you should always check out a place before you eat there, I think you can't judge this place based upon the report that ran on the news without checking on both a) what the violations were, and b) the results of the follow up inspection.  You definitely shouldn't be judging a place you've never even visited. Just my two cents.",

    "text": "When I spotted \"all you can eat\" and \"sushi\" glaring at me from the same sign on the exterior of the building, the stage was set.   As a preface, I should note that I have been an avid sushi hound for nearly thirty years. I know good sushi, sashimi and seafood from meh and there's no fooling me.  First Impressions What I liked - We were immediately greeted upon entering and offered seating. I always prefer to sit at the sushi bar where I can see all the action as well as the food preparation. This was no issue as the sushi bar was deserted. We were promptly handed menus and offered drinks. Very good. What I didn't like - There was no clearly defined reception area. It was somewhat uncomfortable entering, as if we had walked in on someone's private dinner party. A woman walked in right behind us who had arrived ahead of the rest of her party. There really wasn't any place for her to comfortably sit and wait for them. In addition, there was evidence of a defunct conveyor carousel. A neat idea that obviously didn't fly. Cutting boards had been scotch-taped over portions of the carousel as make-shift service areas. It had a very 'not ready for prime time' feel to it. I'm certain it would raise a health inspector's eyebrow as well.  Offerings What I liked - Where AYCE is concerned, one expects a stripped down, naked menu. Such is not the case at Akita Sushi. They present an extensive selection broken out into appetizers, wok dishes, teriyaki and tempura, udon/ramen faire, nigiri sushi and sashimi, rolls, house specialties and desserts. If you are looking for more exotic items like uni (sea urchin) or freshwater scallops, you aren't going to find them at an AYCE establishment. So, be reasonable. What I didn't like - There were no descriptions for many of the dishes. Even simple faire like an udon noodle dish warrants a brief accounting for those who have dietary restrictions or are unfamiliar with Japanese cuisine. For those with severe food allergies, proceed with caution as native English speakers are in short supply and concerns about ingredients may not be fully understood.  Service What I liked - Service was prompt and very courteous. As soon as one of us lifted a menu, someone popped right over ready to take our order. Soft drinks and water were never empty. Very good. Food never sat in the service area for long before being delivered. Empty dishes were quickly removed as well. The check was presented along with desserts and was taken care of in short order thereafter. Again, very good. What I didn't like - I asked a server whether the eel was anago or unagi (sea eel or freshwater eel). He didn't know and didn't offer to find out for me despite standing only a few feet from the sushi chefs who most certainly would have known. Not exactly a deal killer, but servers should be able to answer basic questions about the menu and a shoulder shrug is never the right answer. I ordered it anyway and for the record, it was anago and the only dish I had that wasn't particularly fresh. I told you there's no fooling me. The food delivery was, at times, poorly expedited as some dishes we ordered appeared directly while others seemed to catch up to us twenty minutes or so later. This is more a dysfunction of the kitchen than the service staff but reflects poorly of the service in general. Despite there being only two of us, servers didn't know to whom the dishes belonged when they were delivered. This was an annoyance as we had to stop and identify the dish to try to figure out who ordered it. It would be a nightmare for a large party. Lastly, the check had a full accounting of every last thing we ordered reminding me of my penchant for sushi gluttony. A simple 'AYCE sushi $19.99' would have been in better taste.  Food Quality What I liked - Save for the anago, everything was reasonably fresh, tasted good and was well presented. I had some miso soup and a sampling of a gyoza, then got right down to business with the sashimi and sushi. The trio of sushi chefs seemed a bit overworked but turned out consistent good quality all the same and didn't seem to balk at special requests from other diners. Portions were reasonable and not overly spiced or awash in sauces. Most dishes came out quickly with a few exceptions. Nothing really went over what was reasonable timewise. All very good. What I didn't like - Sushi rice should be sticky. The rice was a bit flaky and didn't hold together. Nigiri pieces not wrapped in seaweed disintegrated on the plate. Once again, not a deal killer for $20 AYCE, but you wanted a review and I'm giving you one.  Ambience The dining room was comfortable if arranged a bit cafeteria-like. The sushi bar was more brightly lit than necessary but ok. The interior was decked out in nice upscale finishes belying the $20 AYCE modus operandi.  With the caveat that service is a bit quirky and Akita has the feel of a first-time restaurateur, I would recommend it for good food and value.",

Second visit was far, far worse. It seemed they only had 2 waiters for a packed lunch service, we arrived and were seated promptly. Our waiter brought us ice water and took our order.  Then the wait began, we sat for approximately 40 minutes with zero attention or food. We watched 3 tables that had come in AFTER we had been seated receive their food and begin eating, waiters were walking table to table with plates of food asking if they had ordered it before finally realizing that (some of it) was ours. We waited 45 minutes for 4 pieces of gyoza and 2 pieces of nigiri hamachi sushi. The sushi we received had dry rice and the fish felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp.  15 minutes later we received two more of the rolls we ordered (we ordered it all at once) after seeing it sit in the food-pass for the duration. 10 minutes after we received our 2 rolls, we received the rest of our order, which was admittedly better than the food we had received so far, likely due to it not sitting for long periods of time before reaching our table.  Overall, our first visit had us very excited to go there again and again but it seems like amateur hour without the owner around. We'll probably give it one more shot but the second visit left a very sour taste in our mouth,",

    "text": "I have a feeling this place won't be in business very long if they keep running things the way they are.  First off, we went to this place on Sunday for what we had been told was a $10 or so all you can eat (we were debating between this place and a few others we usually frequent that have similar specials, but decided to give them a shot as we'd never been here).  When we arrived the ATMOSPHERE WAS VERY DRAB and the CONVEYOR BELT HAD BEEN TURNED OFF.  We shrugged it off, sat down, and the waiter (before even giving us a chance to look at the menu) asked what we were going to order.  We decided to get some appetizers (WHICH NEVER CAME) and after waiting for about 20 minutes (and having 3 DIFFERENT SERVERS ask if we needed to place an order) we finally decided to get some sushi.  When the sushi came out THE ROLLS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE COLD CAME OUT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE (we didn't think about it until we were halfway through our meal).  We decided to try to get our appetizers again, and when they finally came out WE ONLY GOT HALF THE ORDER (did I mention the PORTIONS OF THESE SERVINGS WERE VERY SMALL, like a seaweed salad was literally about 2-3 bites).  Finally we ordered the ice cream and fried bananas (with the intention of eating them together)... we got the ice cream and didn't get the banana until we had finished the ice cream 10-15 minutes later.  All in all this wouldn't have been a dealbreaker as we had been under the impression that we were getting this for around $20-25 bucks... then the bill came... it was $45 DOLLARS.  We paid without even thinking about it... our change came back with NO RECEIPT (VERY SKETCHY, almost like they were INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO RIP US OFF... btw, you won't find prices anywhere online for these guys or anywhere in the restaurant... not even on that giant chalkboard at the front door that says \"All you can eat\").  I talked to the manager, who asked if we paid already... and I said yes but we wanted to look at the receipt.  He gave me a run around and told me the special was $20 a person, all you can eat.  This is ridiculous, I could've gone to RA, Geisha, Hell... even Stingray and paid less... for better sushi... and a better atmosphere.  Needless to say we will never be returning and I've already told about 5 other people who live nearby not to visit.    Tips to Management:    When you set a price, stick by it (and make it clear that the consumer knows what they're paying for and for how much)   Actually train your servers and assign them to tables... or at least make sure you can keep the conveyor belt running... since you know, you are a conveyor belt restaurant (which probably explains why the service was so terrible)  FOR GODS SAKE, MAKE THOSE LITTLE SUSHI ORDER FORMS, YOU GUYS COULDN'T KEEP TRACK OF A PHONE NUMBER IF I WERE TO GIVE IT TO YOU!  If you're gonna charge as much as you do, you damn well better make sure you're sushi is at least (if not better than) the quality of your competitors (there is no excuse for lukewarm sushi... take that shit to Mesa or South Phoenix or something).",

Good quality, good variety, friendly service.  Tempura was too thick, but the zucchini and shrimp were the best of what I tried.  The red snapper and tuna were my favorites as both nigiri and sashimi, but that is likely just preference.  The unagi nigiri was nice too.  The rolls are small, but that's nice, because you have room for more variety.  I always like rainbow rolls and Akita's were delicious.  My hands down favorite was the special roll with spicy tuna and avocado topped with with cracked black pepper crusted tuna, tempura flakes and eel sauce.  So good, one of the best combos I've tried.  If you're looking for the finest sushi in Scottsdale, this is not your spot, but you want a nice meal out with friendly staff and delicious sushi, Akita is a great spot.",

Pretty much everything you could want on the menu was there, tons of variety. I highly recommend the Akita roll. The service was also super fast and friendly. My only complaint is that the agedashi tofu had too much batter caked on before frying. Then again, this place offers incredible value for the price so it still gets 5 stars. I will definitely be coming back again.",

The wait was only about 5-10 minutes and we were seated right away.   After ordering several rolls, my girlfriend and I were anxious on seeing how these would turn out. When we got them, they were a nice small portions compared to ones I've been too, which isn't so bad. You can order a bigger variety and still be able to eat them all.   But the rolls where I wanted to add crunchy tempura flakes were just awful. We couldn't immediately tell these flakes were hard and just straight up stale.   The Salmon sashimi ( on my second order) seemed slimy and just fishy. All the fried tempura (crab leg, mushroom, sweet potato) tasted pretty delightful.   I had a better time eating some of the appetizers than the actual house special rolls. All in all, it was a decent place for the price!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I absolutely love Japanese food and usually spend on average $40-50 each on sushi. So when we found out that there is an all you can eat japanese restaurant in North Scottsdale that would only cost us about $21 each, we drove all the way from Central Phoenix.    In addition, a coworker of mine had mentioned that this place is decent for all you can eat sushi. Being that this place is an all you can eat restaurant, my expectations were not high at all.   With that being said, I was still very ecstatic to try their food, especially because they had a little bit of everything. In addition to the variety of sushi, they had appetizers (gyoza, tempura, etc), salads, teriyaki and fried rice and udon/soba/ramen. I started off with the seaweed salad. I love seaweed salad and can seriously eat it everyday. However, I couldn't take more than a few bites of their seaweed salad. It was sitting in a puddle of green liquid and it pretty much just turned me off. I had the gyoza which was nothing special, and tiny shrimp tempura which came with a dipping sauce that was tasteless. My boyfriend had the ramen/soba, and he thought it tasted like water with salt in it, undercooked noodles and broccoli (broccoli in soba?!?). Sushi was nothing great, but definitely better than all the other items we tried on the menu. I had one of the rolls with the salmon and mango in it, and it was okay. If I was rating just the sushi, I'd probably give Akita 3 stars. Service was sub par. You definitely get what you pay for in this restaurant.",

    "text": "All-you-can-eat sushi in general raises eyebrows.  I went in there twice in two weeks now, hoping to get a good feel for this place the second time around...  Pricepoint: Pretty good for lunch, $14-16 including tip.  Quality of the food for a all you can eat: Honestly, surprising. The nigiri sushi is clearly sliced thinner than normal, though the variety of nigiri is fairly good. Having mackerel is always good and shows that the owner insists on a good variety.   Why go there: The variety of the all you can eat menu is very good. The hot kitchen cranks out some pretty good hot food, sushi isn't necessarily the star here. The tempura'd pieces are good, the oil they are fried in is clean, though most of what they call tempura is panko, which means... They are frozen goodies dropped in the deep fryer! With this volume I don't blame them. Nevertheless, they are not bad. Same thing with the gyoza. There is soup and grilled things, even dessert. You can't beat the price and the service is decent, they could use more smiles on their faces though as my wife says.  Verdict: Good spot for a filling lunch with a buddy or dinner, to shoot the breeze, eat slow and not really have specific cravings for anything in particular, but you know you want Japanese... I sense though the owners are not, as the food reflects a few other cultures in its details. They do crank out the food rather fast.  Try: The fried scallops, the shrimp tempura is good too when it comes to the fried stuff (panko'd). Give their Rainbow roll a shot, it was their most thoughtful and fresh roll. If you don't mind thin nigiri go for it, you just might have to load up. The mango ice cream makes for a good ending.",

If you are not willing to serve the guests that are in your restaurant then what's the point of being open.

    "text": "My friend Patrick and I eat at Akita Sushi regularly because there are very few places in Phoenix where you can dine-on a large variety of all-you-can-eat sushi for only $21 (if you go during lunch, the all-you-can-eat option is only $12). Sure, there are a ton of AYCE sushi restaurants, but they typically restrict you to a tiny menu that's primarily comprised of California rolls and things with cream cheese. Akita, on the other hand, offers nearly their entire menu to all-you-can-eat patrons. You can even order sashimi! Besides sushi, Patrick and I also order udon, tempura, yakatori and potstickers-all for $21. Of course, you have to finish the majority of what is on your plate (although they've allowed a roll or two to straggle behind before), but that's typically a given at any all-you-can-eat place.  The quality of the sushi is also surprisingly good. The fish actually tastes fresh, unlike the unjustifiably popular Sushi Brokers. It's not as high-quality as Hiro, but I've never hesitated to eat something on my plate. If anything, the rice sometimes lacks freshness, but never the fish. The service is friendly and refreshingly speedy, and Akita even offers two-for-one deals on their beers every single day! Combined with the fact that I've never had to wait more than ten minutes to be seated, I'd say that that Akita is a great spot for anyone needing a good sushi fix.",

We live in the middle of the desert and they bring in fresh fish daily which is a miracle in itself! I have been here well over 100 times in the last 3 years and have always had friendly wait staff.  Now, I will say when they are busy, and understaffed then you can wait awhile for your food and sometimes not get everything you ordered.  That is why I don't recommend going on Sunday which seems to be the busiest day there.  I usually go on Saturday right when they open at 11am.  Service then is always prompt, courteous and friendly.   They are usually open on all holidays but recommend calling the day before and check as they were closed once on a holiday.  Parking is a breeze and so is ordering.  Nice big menus to look at then choose anything you want and as much as you want on the little sheets of paper then hand to your server and get ready to enjoy some very good sushi in the desert all for $13.95 (lunch)!  Even if you don't like anything, $13.95 is what 1 roll costs on average at other places, so calm down if you think it's \"nasty sushi\" as you have only wasted a few dollars.   Side note: check out the restroom! It has cool rock features and a unique faucet.    Side note 2: sometimes their water tastes a little like fish so I bring my own bottled water.",

While the menu does not have all of the options found on the dinner menu, it still covered a lot of ground with appetizers, fried rice, basics rolls and specialty rolls. They even have a few dessert options. The sushi is not the best quality but certainly isn't the worst. For being able to order however much you want I actually thought it was pretty decent.   There are papers on the table where you mark down your order. They charge you if you order too much so definitely start small and don't be afraid to put in several orders. The staff was friendly but it did take awhile to get our checks and some small items ordered never came but we did have a group of 7 so maybe it was a bit more difficult to keep track.   I enjoyed the out of control roll and the fried banana for dessert the best. I also had a salmon avocado roll and the Las Vegas roll. Those with me tried a lot of different things on the menu and most had positive reactions. Again it's not the greatest sushi but for the price point it definitely is a deal. I'd return if I was in the mood for an AYCE experience.",

You can order in the beginning and later, so don't worry about not worrying enough. You can get your money's worth.  In the beginning the service was slow, but it really picked up. The waiter kept coming back to see what else we needed.  I also liked the decor a lot, pretty flowers and eye pleasing tones.  I tried to order what I reasonably felt I could eat. Out of what I chose the mushroom tempura was probably my favorite. The seaweed salad was overdressed. My rolls were okay, but kind of messy. I believe the out of control roll was the table's favorite. The green tea ice cream is also worth mentioning.  I am still on the fence about this all you can eat sushi place, yet I think it could be a better experience now that I know what to order (definitely taking a peek at what my other fellow Yelpers said!)",

Look at my other photos I post and you'll see a significant difference - and the price is identical to this place. Luckily I'm just visiting from out of town,  but yeah a complete thumbs down. Service was okay just really impersonal and the staff not talking English when around customers but I can tell they're talking about other customers and making snarky jokes because I work at an Asian based company so I know the language to an extent. But really, just some advice: please less rice. It's bad. Reallly, really bad. And makes it taste starchy and chewy.",

They offer more than just sushi - they have appetizers, salads, teriyaki, udon, etc.  The delivery is fast and there's also free refills on soda.

Granted the dinner price is expensive, they do have all you can eat sashimi which makes up for it, and the rolls menu is expanded. The fish can either be good, or it can be old, it's not really consistent so it just depends on when you go.   I do tend to go about once a month because it does satisfy the sushi craving. The problem is that if you do order the nigiri, be warned that the rice they use isn't legit sushi rice. It's almost as if they just take rice from a rice cooker, wait for it to cool down a bit, and then they throw fish on top of it. It's hit or miss on the rolls, sometimes the rolls are good, sometimes they are bad.   The one thing that is constant however is the appetizers, they seem to do pretty well on that, except for the time I ordered the crab tempura (which they use imitation crab by the way), and there was a plastic wrapper around the imitation crab and it was deep fried (I showed them this and they decided to let me eat that day for free, cool I guess?).  Overall it is okay here, I clearly have had better, but for the price and what is offered it isn't that bad. If you do have a sushi craving, it does satisfy it if you do come here.",

It was $23 a person if I remember it right for dinner and you can have anything on the menu. The only thing not Included are drinks and if you order too much and do not finish it you will get charged a full price for the sushi you ordered. Needless to say we finished everything.  I only rated this place a 3 star because the ginger they provided looked like it had been dried out from sitting out too long, also there's no real crab meat, it was all \"crab stick\" but the menu does say it so you won't feel cheated if you order something with crab. When I checked their online menu they used to have a soft shell crab that I was looking forward too but they don't carry that anymore.  It was clean for the most part. I did see a fruit fly but it didn't land on anything I was eating.  It was an ok experience but not sure I would go there again. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.",

Ouch.  As I shoveled another piece of some kind of dragon roll into my mouth, I began to wish that we stuck to only eating sashimi because dang, maki rolls had hella rice! The fish quality here is pretty great and at $23ish/pp, you really can't beat that price. The yellowtail here is so buttery and delicious and the salmon was amazing. The knife cuts are a little thinner but are very uniformed. It's also fresh as you can still see the fish glistening under the lights. I also recommend trying the eggplant teriyaki. Most appetizers, sashimi, and nigiri can be ordered by 1-piece and the rolls comes with eight pieces. Don't end up over-ordering like me and my girlfriend. They also serve fried rice, stir-fried and soup-based udon, tempura, and dessert on the AYCE menu. Service is fast and prompt and I definitely think it's one of the better AYCE sushi joints in our land-locked state.  \"Do you think I can sit here with my jeans undone?\"  \"Yeah, I'll do it too.\"  #NoShame #OkayMaybeALittleShame",

There is a very dated taste to the rolls that is masked by heavy sauces (e.g., eel sauce, sweet sour sauce), and a lot of rice. The flavor profile is just bad.  The appetizers that are deep fried (e.g., tempura) tasted frozen and the batter was just awful. Our yakitori chicken was also not fully cooked.   I might be too critical since I am from Hawaii, however, I believe there must be some standard of sushi especially for the price of $15 each.  Our waiter was great and understanding.

He's absolutely horrible. Then drops off the bill when you're not even done! On top of that, the manager or owner, whoever stands in front where the register is, is so unfriendly, unprofessional and makes you feel like he doesn't want you there.

It took them over a half hour just to get us drinks (she had WATER) and when our food came after 40 minutes it was only the food that I ordered. I saw my food sitting in the window for almost 10 minutes. My friends order NEVER showed up. I offered her some of my food. When we complained they did not take her charge off the bill because they said that she ate my food!!! I was furious.  I said over and over again that she did not get her meal and he just kept repeating back to me that she ate. The bill ended up being $28 and I will never EVER go back there again.  Thanks for ruining her birthday lunch and CHARGING me for it!!!",

    "text": "I grew up in the area, and drove by this location on Via Linda and 90th almost every day since I was 10 years old. In the last 20 years, this building seems to have the worst luck in the world. It's been several different restaurants over the years, none of which seemed to be particularly successful.   I LOVE sushi. I tried Teharu further north at FLW and the 101 and really liked the revolving concept--it was cheap and FAST. Perfect for a quick lunch when you've got a packed day. The sushi there was kinda mediocre, though, so I really only go in anymore when I need that FAST lunch. I was really excited to try Akita to see if they did any better.   The first time I went in was within the first two weeks they were open. I was really pleasantly surprised. The prices were almost double what you'd see at Teharu for some things, but the portions were larger and the quality and freshness were much higher. I went in several times after that and really enjoyed each time--the bad luck of this building made me want to go in and spend money there as much as possible...   In July, when I finally managed to get my mom over there with me to try it, we were disappointed to see they had just started the all-you-can-eat thing on Sundays and Mondays (it was lunch on a Sunday). While our food was good, it took forever and we had many different servers handling our orders. We eventually got everything we asked for, but it was not the experience I went in there expecting from my many lunch visits. And now, I'm reluctant to go back... I loved the revolving-ness of it for the speed and ability to just pluck up what I want and tally up my plates. Good, fast easy lunch. But if they're going to make me waste my already short lunchtime waiting for the menu items, then I might as well just stay on the freeway for a couple more exits and go to Teharu instead.   All in all, if anyone from Akita is listening--I've been in your place enough to be called a \"regular\" and I really don't think you gave the revolving thing enough time or effort. I'm sure there are ways to figure out what your bestselling items are, and keep those on the conveyor in smaller quantities to avoid waste and then allow people to order those items not on the conveyor a'la carte if they want them. I don't want you to close down--I love your food. But I HATE that you gave up and started the \"all you can eat\" thing. I think it's a big mistake and I will NEVER come in for the all-you-can eat again. If I walk in and the belt's not moving, I'm walking right back out.   Good luck--again, GOOD sushi. Poor strategy. I'd stay away from the all-you-can-eat, but if the belt's moving, it's a treat. :)",

Needless to say, all the rolls were great.  We also had a small noodle bowl and a small salad.  We also ordered calamari tempura, fried bananas, green tea ice cream. The portions are not overly large, so we were okay even after eating all of this.   The service was good.. I'm not sure why people complained about service because to us it was fine.   I'd recommend coming here for sushi if you're hungry!",

    "text": "I am not a fan. First, when we walked in, no one greeted us, although several staff members did give us sideways glances. After a few minutes one of the waiters seated us. Several minutes later the waiter came back to take our drink orders. We told him that this was our first time here and asked how it worked. We were told to help ourselves to any food coming by on the conveyer belt and we would be charged for it at the end. Then we asked for the prices and he pointed to some different colored plates on the wall with prices written on them. So it was something like $2 for a pink plate and $5 for a black plate, etc. The prices seemed reasonable.   The food coming around on the conveyor belt was mostly pieces of rolls. We tried some and it ok, nothing to brag about. The problem was the same stuff kept coming around and some of it looked like it had been there awhile. Also, there was no traditional nigiri sushi on the conveyor belt and we were tired of California rolls, so we flagged our waiter down and asked for menus. He brought them and when we tried to flag him down again to order the Manager or Owner (someone more important) came over and informed us that they were not doing menu service, only conveyor service. When we said that after being there for over 20 minutes we still did not see what we wanted coming by on the conveyor and we just wanted some nigiri sushi, he said ok, ok I will get it for you. I think he was trying to please us, but instead of nigiri sushi we got sashimi, again, it was ok. The food was actually kind of boring.   Overall, this was not the sushi experience we had been looking forward to. The quality of the food was a little low and the hospitality of the staff was missing.",

The revolving part is great fun, although a few of the signs could have used more detailed descriptions. You can also order off the menu & there are lots of traditional cooked items as well as sushi & sashimi. Plates are color-coded for price so it's easy to keep track of spending. The chef is right there to create specialty rolls at your request. He is extremely friendly & more than willing to answer questions (the revolving thing cost $100,000 & this is his third restaurant).  The entire staff was friendly & helpful without being intrusive. When we sat down & were handed the traditional split bowls with wasabi & pickled ginger, I laughingly told the waiter we would be needing LOTS more ginger, expecting refills later when we ran out. He immediately brought a huge bowl & yes, my sister & I ate it all.  Don't know what to say about the food violations concerns that 2 people mentioned. One at least was written when they'd just opened; perhaps the problems have been resolved. The place looked immaculate & the food was extremely fresh. We both loved it. Definitely going back!",

    "text": "We wondered about this place every time we drove by and finally decided to check it out tonight.  The staff was friendly and the service was good but... The sushi was warm and all the plates on the conveyor belt have been rotating even before we got there and most of them were still there until we left (we stayed over an hour). AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.  They never even bothered to replace the older plates no matter how long they've been sitting there rotating at room temperature.  Seaweed salad was been on there for so long,  it was seeping moisture,  looked more like seaweed soup than salad. I was craving yellowtail sashimi but didn't feel like taking the only plate that's been rotating there for who knows how long,  so I ordered fresh plate and the fish came out half frozen.  Plates on rotation are warm and the ones you order come out frozen..  Also it was a bit pricey for the quality and considering it's a revolving sushi bar rather than a traditional sushi restaurant.  (90 bucks Not including gratuity for not so fresh sushi,  I wasn't very happy about that).  I really hate leaving negative reviews but one thing that makes me mad the most is spending decent amount of money for bad quality food.  If I'm gonna spend hundred bucks at a restaurant,  i want to feel satisfied after dining and it wasn't the case this time. I'm very disappointed at this place  since I've been looking forward to check this place out for several weeks. I guess i can stop wondering now. I just hope I don't get sick from eating warm raw seafood. I give 2 stars for friendly service. After i came home,  I immediately came online to see what other people had to say and saw that the restaurant had several health violations. Honesty I'm not shocked... I'm sorry to have to leave negative feedback but this is how I felt after tonight.  I don't think we will be going back unless there's a significant improvement.  Good luck Akita revolving sushi.

What I really didn't care for was the arrangement of the place.  the revolving sushi is set up in the shape of an \"E\", with all of the seat as though you were sitting at the sushi bar.  One end of the E you are sitting at the bar, but the remainder you're looking across sushi parading by and into the eyes of another diner.  I was fortunate to have a couple of cute girls across from me - a plus - but one could envision situations that would be less pleasant.  The other place in town gets past this by putting tables that extend off of the revolving sushi conveyor, an arrangement I much prefer.  There were a few of these at Akita, but not many.  I'll be back, but either with a group so I get the table, or sit in front of the prep are (bar).  I certainly wouldn't want to be sitting across from another dude that looks like me....",

We informed waitstaff and they appeared to be clueless. service is sooo slow we ended up staying at the restaurant for 2.5 hours before we started getting irritated and got up and left. Not worth coming here when there are better sushi restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "I experienced the WORST customer service at Akita Sushi.  We came in on Sunday with 7 people right as Akita Sushi opened.  We were seated immediately and the restaurant began filling up very quickly.  We placed our order and waited for our sushi.  We spent about 2.5 hours in the restaurant, and by the end, still did not receive all the items we ordered off the menu.  It was absolutely ridiculous.  It also didn't help that our waitress didn't speak any English, so it made the ordering experience much more difficult (even though we indicated everything we wanted on the sheet that we were instructed to fill out).  Anyhow, we placed the same order over and over again in hopes that we would get the food we wanted, but no luck.  We got a couple of sushi items we ordered but not all of them.  We kept bringing this to the attention of the waitstaff, but nothing was done about it.  After 2.5 hrs, we finally got impatient and left.  Not to mention, there were people that came in after us and left before us.  Not sure what was so complicated about a table of 7 people...  The sushi we received was decent, but NOT worth the overall experience.  There are a ton of great sushi places in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  Don't waste your time on this place.  Horrible, horrible experience.",

Our waiter recommended 2 crab sushi rolls that weren't on the conveyer belt because they wouldn't have kept well for a long period of time.  They were both unique and flavorful.

From the moment we walked in and asked a question, the host yelled back at us $13.50!!!!! We weren't even asking about price. We should have walked out at that time but my daughter really wanted rolls for lunch.   The young lady that took our drink and food order was pleasant but we rarely seen her. When our food was brought to the table, it was dropped in front us and practically thrown on the table if you happened to be on the far side.   All in all, we got one order of the All You Can Eat sushi. We put in a second order but after waiting a half hour for it, I ended up just asking for the check. My kids had another order ready to go in for ice cream but it was pretty evident that would not be taken anytime soon and we were not about to wait another half hour for food that wasn't going to come out.  Needless to say, our Sunday lunch was ruined.",

I'm super happy we decided to give it a try because it was so worth it!  okay so basically as of 6/11/16 the lunch price is $12.99 and dinner $21 for all-you-can-eat sushi plus other food on the menu(A LOT MORE). The catch is that you have to eat it all with no waste otherwise they will charge for leftovers not consumed. That being said, I did notice they add a lot of rice to the sushi, but not overly crazy. I recommend ordering the 6 pieces instead of the 1 hand-roll since the handroll is 80% rice and fills you up faster and equal to 3 rolled pieces. The 6 piece rolls have more flavor and are actual sushi rolls.   Holy cow we had our fill and enjoyed it all:) We will definitely be going back!",

There all also some non sushi options like fried rice, teriyaki chicken, noodles, and more.  The entire place seems very clean and well kept, and the staff is very friendly and polite. I think the food comes pretty quickly as well, which is impressive since it's made to order! The quality of the sushi itself is spectacular. I love the volcano roll. A few hands of salmon skin rolls is also one of my new favorites, definitely worth a try if that's up your alley. To finish off the meal, I always highly recommend a serving or two of the green tea ice cream - yum!  Definitely come with an empty stomach, there are so many tasty sounding options and I always get too full before I can try everything. Overall, best ayce sushi you can find!!",

Everything was clean and well kept. Our server frequently checked in on us, and our food came much more quickly than expected. You could see all of the sushi chefs making the fresh sushi. Weird side note: the bathrooms were SO COOL! The walls were rock and the sink was jade and went up the wall then divided into two. The food was amazing!

Over all, food was good for the price. I would definitely go again, but the guy needs a attitude adjustment. Without the guy 4.5 stars.",

The sushi was clearly top rate, more equivalent to that of a full service sushi bar. The service was exceptional even though they have only been in business a few months. Yep it costs more than Teharu but the quality and taste was there. My wife and I will be back to sample the more extensive menu!",

It's not buffet style which definitely classes it up. It really is a beautiful place, actually. Not cheap like you might expect. The bathrooms are incredible. I might sound crazy, but just see for yourself. They have a large variety of food to order from and they always serve it so quickly! Go in with an empty stomach, you'll definitely want to make room for everything! The Volcano roll is really neat and delicious, too! Keep it up!",

    "text": "This is my first experience with any type of AYCE sushi. And let me just start off by saying, I didn't have high expectations. This establishment is by no means terrible, and for an AYCE style restaurant the quality was acceptable. I will say that I did feel a bit sick after leaving, but that's probably because I ate more than I could handle.  The lunch special is extremely affordable and the nigiri is by far the best thing on the menu. However, I wasn't the biggest fan of the maki rolls, or the yakitori. The fish wasn't necessarily some of the best that I've ever had, but for the price it is being sold at, it's understandable. Regardless, there is a huge selection of food that you can choose from and the serving sizes are perfect so that you can get a little bit of everything.  The restaurant was exceptionally clean, the bathroom was unique. You would have to see it to understand what I mean. The restaurant had a very calm and cool ambiance that made it seem kind of young. I would definitely recommend this place solely on price, but maybe not so much on the quality of sushi.",

You can also pay for the Dinner selection for lunch, which is what I always do, extra $8 for dinner selection, but you get unagi (eel) sushi, sashimi, and more specialty rolls.  Also you can get oysters.  There appeitizers are good and the portions are small for noodle/soup dishes and cooked dishes so that makes it easier to try several things.  Now is the sushi as good as Hiro downt eh street, no, but for the price the quality is higher than a AYCE Chinese place that servers sushi.  I'm a fan of both places.",

The server handed us a menu and we looked at it.  There were no prices.  I asked our server why there went any prices.  She told us, everything on the menu is ayce and it's $11.99.  I could not believe it .  This menu had sushi, tempura, soups, salads and many more items.  Now let me just say that when you order sushi it's by the piece, as well as there temura.  Sushi and rice ratio is perfect. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that they don't have scallops for sushi.  Dinner is $19.99 and is a way bigger menu with sashimi on it. If you're in the neighborhood you should really check this place out.  It's only an ayce place, so don't think you can go in and buy one item because you will be paying full price for the ayce.",

Tried  the udon noodles which was tasty but the beef was way overcooked . I ordered  teriyaki  chicken and got salmon.  This was way overcooked.  The scallops  tasted like  artificial  crab.

The website was a little confusing because it doesn't say anything about it being an all you can eat place, more so it shows things you can order for takeout, which are much more expensive then dining in.  When we got there i instantly ordered as much nigiri and I thought I could stomach (its one piece per order), They had really high quality salmon and tuna, to my surprise.  We then moved on to rolls, then more nigiri and I instantly regretted it since I was getting so full I thought i was going to burst. (why you were leggings or a dress to all you can eat places!) hahaha. Yet, we fought our way through 6 more pieces of nigiri. While we were looking at the menu for dessert, we read some small print stating that whatever you don't eat you have to pay for.  So i start panicking... is that extra $_ per roll?, per piece? per part of nigiri?! I have to admit I started just to eat the salmon off the tops of the rice balls so I could end up eating more fish and not being tricked by the rice.  After reading this, my fiance and I had a hilarious time trying to hide left-over balls of rice into our napkins while the servers weren't looking.  I'm sure this was dramatic on our part because we ate everything else, but you can never be too careful!  This place does say that its a rotating sushi restaurant, but none were running when we were there, it was just made to order. So, just be mindful of how hungry you are, and hope that your brain isn't bigger than your stomach.   After reading all these amazing reviews I really wish I would of tried the dessert, but I guess there is always next time.   For ambiance and service, it was quite dark in there, but like I care to see other people, I just want to see enough to evaluate the food in front of my face.  The service was fabulous. Super attentive and always clearing off our plates and filling our water glasses.   I must admit, the dessert does have some excellent sushi. Shocking as that is.",

    "text": "I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars because I think the only downfall I experienced could be easily improved upon.  The food is wonderful.  The sushi is delicious -- I had several different rolls, including the California Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Green Dragon.  No complaints about the sushi.  The tempura is good, too -- nice and lightly crispy.  The udon is very decent, and the pork cutlet that came with it was cooked perfectly.  The ice cream is okay, but the fried banana with honey is probably the best banana I've ever had in my life.  I went for dinner, which was $20.  It's a little pricey, but I hear that the lunch menu is very similar but only $12.    The one thing I think could be improved is their efficiency.  There's nothing wrong with the servers -- they're very friendly and helpful.  Even the owner came to say hi, and he hopped in to help when things got busy.  However, I feel like they all work too hard.  Work smart, not hard, right?  They're literally running around, trying to keep up with the demands of the tables.  They do a great job given how many people they have, but with current circumstances, it's just not feasible.  There were times when my table waited five to ten minutes to get a hold of a server, and they weren't standing around lazily ignoring us, either -- they were BUSY.  Akita Sushi either needs to hire an extra server or two OR they need to change the ordering system.  All in all, it's a great experience if you have the time.   I will be back, though, and I hope things run a bit more smoothly next time.  I'll keep this review updated!",

This time, however, I did the all-you-can-eat ($11.99/person??!!! YEAH!) and it was SCRUMPTIOUS! DELECTABLE! DELIGHTFUL! and oh so tasty.   We ordered miso soup, teriyaki eggplant, edamame, volcano rolls, manhattan rolls, and a variety of tempuras (including shrimp, crab, scallops, and banana w/ honey and chocolate for dessert). The only thing that wasn't a hit was the spicy tuna, but at that point we were so happy with everything else that it is barely worth mentioning.   The service was excellent and attentive.

I tried the Las Vegas volcano roll for the 1st time and I wish I would have tried it sooner. It's a deep fried roll with crab and salmon with some spicy sauce spread across the top. It is now my favorite dish. Service was excellent, food came out quick and drinks were topped off. It was $15.50 a person with the drink plus tax, best deal around.",

We were  sat right away and the waiter was great by explaining how it all worked. Almost everything we tried we liked. It was nice because we were able to take some food risks without worrying about the price tag. The waiter was great, despite how packed out and busy it was, empty plates didn't sit on the table for more than a minute and our drinks were always being refilled.

They have these cards that you fill out while you're there for each individual item you want to have on the menu each person fills out one and the food supposed to come to on separate plates but instead of doing that they put the teriyaki chicken and mixed it with the salmon which was only for me yet my girlfriend ordered teriyaki chicken as well and is allergic to salmon and they expect my girlfriend to eat it with salmon. They tend to mix up orders a lot. Don't ask if you have any food allergies. And seem to pretend to not speak English. The table next to use got teriyaki chicken that was still raw. I could have cook this stuff home and had a better F ing meal.

For dinner its around $20.00 per person. They have a pretty diverse menu, sushi, ton's of apps, udon noodle soup, fried rice, chicken/steak and salmon teriyaki, etc. so there is something for everyone here.  - Service was spot on... Our waiter was friendly and attentive without being obtrusive.  - Food surprisingly wasn't bad... even the sushi quality was on par with what you would get at a RA or Stingray (in my opinion). - If your a fan of Americanized sushi (think Las Vegas rolls, Philly Rolls) this place is for you!  - Food came out quick and hot. Everything is prepared to order. - Skip the spicy scallop roll, I don't know what in the world the filling was, but It wasn't scallops.   Overall, I wasn't expecting a positive experience for my first AYCE sushi, so I was pleasantly surprised. When I am in the mood to eat my weight in sushi rolls and want a little bit of everything - Akita will be my spot!",

Why wasn't this in my life all these years in Arizona?   Typically other AYCE use low quality fish.  However, the fish here is high quality - fresh and flavorful.  The sashimi and nigiri are similar to the ones you order at any sushi restaurant. The boyfriend was raving about how good the squid and mackerel nigiri were. Presentation wise, this place gets an A+. All the rolls and hand rolls were beautifully displayed in front of our faces. If you're tired of eating sushi, they have a variety of appetizers, soup/salad, fried rice, teriyaki, and udon. I really enjoyed the cheese wonton and tempura, all fried to a crispy perfection. My friends had the seaweed salad, which was delicious. If you still have room for dessert, get the green tea ice cream. I just can't enough of anything that's green tea. Simply unbelievably! All of the above for only $20.99 per person.    The service was fast and efficient, especially for serving such a large party. I like the convenience of specifying the quantity of everything you want on a sheet of paper. There is no doubt in my mind that I will be returning.",

They did not charge us extra for not finishing.  I think the extra charge for leftovers is if people order too much food that they don't finish.    The seafood udon (not soup) sucked.

    "text": "First of all the food was fabulous! No complaints there at all! The one star I am giving is for food.  Unfortunately the service was dismal, and pretty much ruined the event. My partner called ahead for reservations for his birthday part. We had 14 people. There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant, so our service was very very slow. While most people seemed to eventually get their orders, I think they literally forgot about me and my kids.  I put my orders in for myself and my kids, and after 15 minutes I got one of my items and that's it. I gave it to my children because they were starving. While other people were getting served (some of them on their second rounds), my order and my kids' orders seemed to have been forgotten.   After 45 minutes and repeatedly asking the waiter when our food might come (she did not respond-- she was overwhelmed and just kept nodding her head and walking away) my partner got up and found the manager and alerted him to this problem. Apparently the waiter missed the fact that three people were sitting there without food for an hour.   We had to resubmit our order. Fifteen minutes later (and over an hour after we originally ordered) we got *some* of the items. We never got the full order. One of my kids never had her beverage delivered, even when I asked repeatedly for this. I shared my Coke with her for the whole meal. Another guest asked for tea three times and her tea never came.  The other issue is that apparently you can ONLY get the all you can eat for dinner. You are not allowed to order separate entrees for dinner. This can get expensive for a family with kids, at $25/person (especially when they are not even given their food!). The entree option is only available on the lunch menu. We didn't know this until we arrived. Neither the menu or the website mentions this.   The lunch menu, by the way, still advertises a rotating sushi bar. That rotating sushi bar is no longer at the restaurant. Which is why we chose the restaurant in the first place.",

First of all you'd think $20 is a good price for all you can eat sushi but they purposely take their time bringing you your food so you can digest.

This time I came with my friends and I already ate prior so when I told the server I wasn't eating, he gave me such a dirty look and proceeded to go to the manager and talked crap. I'm assuming he thought I was going to try to get away with eating some of my friends' food but still. They also stare at you every time you take a bite of food. I'm sorry but you should never treat a costumer the way our server did. Very disrespectful! It's sad to say that I've felt this way on more than one occasion.",

They tasted like they were made from fish.  I thought yakitori was typically grilled, but it looked like they just threw it in a dryer.  Was pretty oily so I left it on the plate.  I would stick with sushi here as it's the best bet.",

The green tea ice cream was indeed delicious, the fried bananas were okay, I liked the chocolate sauce ones best. The fish was cut well and was good quality. I did not see how much the \"all you can eat\" costs but I luckily arrived in time for lunch and it is priced as 12.99 .  The green iced tea was pretty good very green, and my server was better as time went on",

It ranged from not just sushi, but also fried noodles, udon, soba in soup, dessert, so that was pretty satisfying to try out. The ratio for the nigiri of rice to fish was pretty sad. It was about a 1:3 ratio fish to rice. The other all you can eat sushi's I've had, the quality wasn't too bad but this one was mediocre. It fulfilled my slight sushi craving, but also disappointed me at the same time. Price is really cheap for lunch though, just $15 if you want to fulfill that quick sushi craving. for a good price.",

When I saay slow I mean real slow...and inaccurate. Lol we had to laugh but you get a paper to mark off what your table wants. Then the waiting begins...and stuff starts coming in intervals. Some of the items we ordered we had to put 3 papers in...but I think at this point other tables are tired of waiting and when the waiter asks them if the order belongs to them they just take what they want instead of waiting another hour. The waiter even asked us to please be honest in a frantic display of desperation to bring out the correct food. Overall I would be back for a good laugh and good food. The price is good but be prepared to be patient!",

Akita offers a huge selection of sushi, appetizers and desserts in their all-you-can-eat menu and at a cost that you would not believe! In a sitting, we would order about five rolls and they'd be at our table within 10 minutes. The staff were super friendly, the food was fast, fresh and very well made, and to top it off, it was affordable. I will absolutely be going back.",

They never ask how you're doing and it takes them forever to give you water. If I'm eating wasabi, I would like some water. They usually get your order wrong, give you a dirty look when you don't eat the food they mistakenly gave you, and then you're stuck waiting for what you actually ordered. The place is dirty and gross. The cooks spend half the time watching T.V. The quality of the sushi has generally declined over time. The last roll my fiancee ordered was falling apart it was wrapped so poorly. Their fried food is sometimes undercooked. Their seaweed salad is sometimes still frozen. This place is just not worth the money or the head ache. It is sad because there were times we went and it was awesome. We are never going back.",

It's understandable that they need to make profit and putting too little rice would take away from that profit margin but it's a problem when all you can taste is rice. Second round of nigiri had horrible quality sashimi so as someone else has stated before make sure to order what you think you'll need the first time around.   As for the service expect it to be very slow and horrible. Everyone there gets super defensive when you ask them something as if they'll get in trouble for doing something wrong. For example, we told them that we had ordered a hand roll and not the regular roll and one of the waiters (Asian guy who seems like he has something stuck up his ___) got very defensive saying that he wasn't the one who took our order so it's not his fault. All we were asking was to possibly get another order of hand rolls, which shouldn't be a problem as it is an ALL YOU CAN EAT RESTAURANT. The only plus was the lady waitress who was the best and most normal.   But in the end it's 11.99, which is pretty much what stopped me from teaching this restaurant a lesson on what service should be like. Hence the 2 stars instead of 1 that they rlly deserve.",

It was all really really good and some of it (the salmon and spicy tuna/salmon) was exceptional. The sashimi cuts are great and the nigiri is wonderful (no skimpy fish on top of huge rice balls here).

    "text": "We stumbled into Akita because Hiro had line out the door and I was impatient and figured we could drive across the street and get Miso soup and a roll.   Everything about Akita had feel of cheap Chinese all you can eat buffet.   If youre a college kid or wanna stuff yourself because you just got out of prison...fine.. but dont go here on date night.   I am shocked this place gets decent reviews when there are quality sushi places in SCOTTSDALE.   ( Hiro ) .  From reading reviews, there apparently is demand for cheap,  warm,  raw fish with bathrooms decorated like a cave ( wtf? why would anyone post a pic of a toilet on a review of a Sushi restaurant ? )  and this restaurant fills that unique niche.    The fish was sliced razor thin on the rolls. I could actually see through the tuna on the whatever-it-was roll.   The rolls were not cold and crisp and no flavor as youd expect.  Couldn't finish the miso soup, tofu was tiny squares like youd get out of packaged miso at grocery.  My lovers eyes were a whirlwind of pain as she chewed slowly and smiled politely, and I knew my haste was responsible for her suffering.   I had to avert my gaze and fixated on the water bucket Dad had hidden in the hallway he was using to rinse the bus rag ( like listening to a mop bucket during dinner? )  and how the son had filthy jeans on like he worked construction earlier in the day.  Mom was shuffling around in her new pink crocs.  Ditto on everyone in the family tripping over themselves to handle the tables and getting orders mixed up.   Meal is $20 for all you can eat which would be two rolls to break even but we couldn't finish what we ordered.  Next time Hiro is packed Ill goto Frys grocery and eat in, their sushi is much fresher and more flavorful.",

Everything is good quality and really tasty. The only bad thing is that it gets really busy in there and the service can be slow, but at that price it's worth the wait. And that the lunch menu is much smaller than the dinner menu, so if you want more variety I suggest going for the dinner menu.",

Everyone was really friendly and funny enough, the kids thought the bathrooms were cool. I dropped a star because the restaurant is a bit dark. I think they should play music or something to improve the ambiance.",

The sushi and sashimi taste pretty great, especially for Arizona. And the pricing is very competitive. Lunch is $12!! Hopefully that will discourage people from feeling obligated to gorge. Try it! Service is great too.",

    "text": "Well like so many others I loved Akita sushi. We went for a late lunch today, a friday.   We were seated immediately and drink orders were taken. As soon as we sat down the little paper order sheets were presented. This is your ticket to sushi bliss. Just mark down the quantity of each item you want. Then the very attentive waitresses start bringing out plate after plate of fresh sushi goodness.  It was almost embarassing how many plates we had at our table.   We tries lots of different rolls and a few appetizers. I WILL be back to try more and hope to, someday, possibly try some of the hot food items like udon, teriyaki, Katsu style chicken and pork......    I am so full but already planning my next visit.  ENJOY, I DID!!!",

Unlike most other AYCE Sushi restaurants, Akita allows unlimited Sashimi! I would have to say I've tasted slightly better quality sushi but with the great variety that Akita offers, I would still choose this place. The service was decent - good, sometimes we would have to wave a waitress over to take our next order, but everything came out relatively quickly. They were all friendly and overall I had a good time eating here. Will DEFINITELY be back!",

He loves all the sashimi options. The food is cooked to order so it is not spinning around on a conveyor belt for lord knows how long.  I'm not a fish eater and find plenty of yummy options. It's clearly stated to only order what you will eat so don't complain if they try to charge you for ordering too much. What he is able to consume would cost us over $100 at other sushi places.  This place is a gem and we will continue to go there often.",

With any all you can eat place, there is an understandable compromise of quality, and most people going to the restaurant understand that. With Akita, the sushi was definitely good enough to come back. By no means are you getting world class rolls, but they are just as good as other places, and for only $12 for lunch, it's a steal.  The restaurant was clean, and the staff was very attentive.  If you don't want to spend $100 on incredible sushi, then you should definitely go to this place and eat to your hearts delight.",
