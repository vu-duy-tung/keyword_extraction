I had the Bianca Vigna bottle that was just Devine. I sat at the bar with my wonderful wife and a family friend so it was just a great atmosphere. An unexpected plus was the lovely ladies from El Paso sharing great foodie tips. Postinos has a simple menu but yet established choices with a hint of wow. Simply saying that it's a wonderfully exquisite spot.",

I want to say, up front, that this place was my absolute favorite for HH a couple of years ago....nice patio, tremendous service, and good wine.  I was there at least once a week with a variety of people BECAUSE of  the extra touches.  My last few experiences have ranged from lackluster to \"meh\" and I've decided it's because of the service and not the food.    This trip was no different...from the hostess who let me stand 2 feet in front of her for about a minute without acknowledging me, to the server who seemed not to feel well and had no real patience for our slowness in ordering.    It just looks like this team was not having a good time at work.  There were some notable exceptions; the bartender very pleasant and the young lady who took us to our table was nice as well.  I miss the smiling faces and the energy of folks who enjoy their jobs.  I have no quibbles with the food at all....loves me some tomato jam bruschetta, the salmon plate, pickles, and a range of other tasty treats but brunch is also about ambiance and I expect so much more when I'm spending $100 for a table of four.    This neighborhood is filling up with good restaurants and what separates one from the rest is the general comfort and welcoming vibe.  I fervently hope that this location begins to value this very simple concept as the market becomes more competitive.  So, how does Postino get to that 4th, or even 5th, star??  Say Hi to me when I come in.  Smile at me and say \"Be right with you\". Swing by and ask how my food is. Don't tell me you \"have\" to be here.  I can think of several other things but these are quick and don't cost anything.  Until then Postino, you aren't a destination for me.",

There are SO many things on the menu that I love, and I'm trying to maintain a girlish figure, so I can't order everything.  My absolute favorite lunch is the prosciutto/fig/brie sandwich on ciabatta with the mixed greens salad.  The fried shallots, pear, candied nuts, and grapes make it an unforgettable dish, and the salty-sweet combo in the sandwich is perfection.  Their lemonade is the best in town, and it is a steal when you factor in the free refills.  Of course, their wine list is extensive and amazing... but I just can't seem to give up my lemonade!   The service is always good.  Unobtrusive, knowledgeable, and friendly... plus a little hipster (but not TOO much).  It is always on my most-recommended list to friends and visitors.  Their consistency and quality are always spot-on.  If you haven't been, then get yourself there pronto!",

    "text": "I have been coming here for years and recently returned for brunch. I have no idea what happened. From start to finish it was nothing like it used to be. Maybe since they have opened the other locations the owners and partner's just seem to have forgotten about the first one. The hostess was completely rude after telling us there was going to be a 30 minute wait for a table inside she refused to let us take a table out side on the patio when there where 4 open tables and I explained we would just have drinks and one  appetizer there because I needed to feed my child why we waited, and when the table was ready we would move inside . She refused to take our name for the inside table and said, if we take an outside table we could not move inside because it's too confusing for the server to have to move us.  I didn't realise its the severs job to move and reseat guests. After we were seated outside in the 104 we were brought 3 waters for a party of 4 about 7 minutes later a fourth finally arrived and our drink order was taken.  Those took 15 minutes to come. Then a different person whom I believe was our actual server walks up to the table and says ,\"  What do you want brunch is about to end!\"  Not even,  Hello, Do you have any questions? We ordered and the food did come out fairly fast! The food was good and that was consistent. My daughter enjoyed her Granola.  I was the last one still eating and clearly I am no where near done and still eating starts to reach across me from my right side to my mother, who is sitting to my left and why reaching asks her,  \"can I take that?\"  He started to take the plate before she could even answer!  With his smelly arm pit in my face why I am still eating . The fact that his serving etiquette was rude to start but that its summer and we are in Arizona and he's sweating to cross over my plate and put his open arm pit in my face is appalling.  At that point I couldn't finish eating. Requested the check immediately. Too bad the owners have let the customer service go down hill. This place really used to be a great place were the servers took pride in their job and it was considered a great spot. Won't be going back.",

    "text": "I went to Postino Central last night, the food and wine were de-lish, the service was terrible. The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and professional. After that, it really went downhill from there. Disclaimer: it was a very slow night; the restaurant was half-empty.  Part I: The first waiter promised to bring an extra side of brie since we were skimped a little on the fruit and cheese board. He stopped by a few times saying he'd do it (each about 20 minutes apart) and then finished his shift and left without letting us know. So we actually had no idea that we were server-less until we finally stopped to ask someone else.  Part II: The new server who took over was really nice, but kept disappearing. Half an hour after ordering a dessert he let us know he forgot to put it in. He was really polite about it and took it off our tab, but one of the other servers mentioned, \"I thought you said you were full anyway\". It was a little snarky and just made us a little more irritated about waiting for two desserts for 35 minutes.  Parking at this location isn't very convenient. I had to valet my car and then the valets wanted to take off for the night so they said they'd just give us our keys back. I felt obligated so I tipped them, but it left a weird taste in my mouth.  I was disappointed because I've heard such amazing things about Postino and it just seemed like the staff really didn't care about helping us. Maybe it was just an off night, it was slow and Thursdays are pretty hit-or-miss at most businesses. Either way I'm not in a rush to head back there. Aside from the initial hostess who sat us, the servers seemed a little fake; like they were just trying to get through the shift with tips, but didn't genuinely care at all about our experience. Saying they'd help, they'd be right back and then disappearing for twenty minutes, (or in the first server's case; forever). At the prices they charge, it's just not worth it.",

They were really good, i think i want to try some others ones, definitely don't get all of one kind unless you are afraid of change. If that is the case i don't know why you are trying somewhere new to eat.  Food was really good, i got the half panini and soup of the day. The panini i chose was the 9 iron.

All were happy with the food, service, and happy hour drink prices. We went there with 3 kids so my only suggestion would be make sure the parents get that kids menu right away because they were sweating the choices just a bit. All were immediately happy when presented with the kids menu. I love Postino's and can't wait to go back again.",

Most are dressed in formal or business attire. Food is really good and drinks are reasonably priced. I would recommend Postino's to anyone. When I get a chance I always take it to go here. By the way parking sucks, if you don't arrive early enough good luck finding parking or using the valet.",

It was only the last time that they took care of it on the check.  I still love the food, the wine is great, and the atmosphere is swanky.

It's tough to beat. The indoor/outdoor bar is fab. Service is always great and food is always better. The bruschetta, the hoegarden, the paninis, the hoegarden.  And don't forget the brunch, it's amazing. The scones, the egg sandwich, the french toast are all amazing.  Brian DeMarco's Trio plays here on Sunday afternoons too.  if you are looking for a great place to hang out, people watch and enjoy amazing food and drinks, this is the one.",

I definitely know what type of foods/items I will choose. Only rarely, do I completely step out of the box when it comes to food. I just don't like to leave disappointed! The Nine Yard is beyond delicious!  And you have to order the focaccia bread! So light and soft, but filling too! The bacon is quality and was perfectly juicy and crispy. Love to add bacon to most dishes, I have to admit ;) I would have loved to have pesto on this sandwich instead of the dijonnaise. (sp?), but it had the perfect ratio of meat, veggies, bread! Yum!!! I also ordered the Chicken and Mozzarella sandwich. This one is excellent! I had been expecting a chicken breast, so be ready when the chicken comes thinly sliced like lunch meat! The mozzarella is SO fresh and the sun dried tomato mayo is unbelievable. I almost wanted to ask for more. haha! For me, I'm used to ordering a combo lunch with salad or soup. To just get 2 halves of 2 sandwiches I was wanting to order is the best of both worlds! The sandwiches had plenty of greens on them, therefore, just get chips! They are crisp and taste soooo fresh! You may even have leftovers to eat later on! Another bonus is the $5 wine until 7pm or the $5 pitcher! Cant beat that! We would have indulged if we werent on lunch break at nursing school! The brain cells really need to be available for more information ;) I really need to find a friend to indulge in bruschetta with me because they look and sound, AMAZING, just too much for 1 person to eat! They do offer a $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine on Mondays or Tuesdays! Anyone care to join me?!??",

The mixed greens salad with those devilishly good candied pecans and frizzled leeks is something I could eat buckets full of.   I don't understand the bruschetta bullshit though. Their bruschettas are largely bread! Little in the way of the toppings. Kind of a disappointment. And the bread isn't even THAT great (unless you were raised on shitty bread).",

I hate when I asked for a taste of one of the beers and they serve it to me and a warm glass.  Madeline made sure that the glass that I got to taste the beer was cold without even asking. I had a bruschetta board   My favorite is the arugula with bacon and tomato. I also love the salmon with pesto and I asked them to add extra arugula which they did with no problem.  I never want to be a high maintenance customer, but I do like when you have small requests and they have no problem satisfying them. The employees here are great. I especially like Maddelein and Slade. They go above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your visit. Give this a try at happy hour",

Midway through our lunch he told us they were going through a transition and we would get a new server. Our new server was Jenny. We finished our food and closed out. I tipped in cash and wrote CASH on the tip line. Upon checking my accounts, I found out she tipped herself an extra $8 on top of the other cash tip I gave her. My sister and I had a great time and it's a shame that happened. I don't feel I would be comfortable going back as I feel like I was stolen from.

But this morning I felt like we'd have dodged the wait with the 115 degree weeks. That wasn't the case but the wait is a testament to how much the high summer temps doesn't faze the appreciation from their clientele. It's a neat space with inviting and friendly service (none of this hipster aura of exceptionalism). Enjoying $5 mimosas -- and they don't skimp on the bubblie-- we went to town on olives, butchers blocks, and bruschettas.  Oh, and a salad.  The rest was just details. The food was all excellent-- literally every single bite was perfect -- and, while I thought the place looked a little pricey before we were served but, once I was finished, the tab was well-earned.   There's nothing on Postino to make this work. Bygones be to your fear of waits, it's on you to go back to Postino's more often.",

    "text": "Bottom line.  Nice location to have a few drinks and light upscale pub(ish) food with friends.  Service 4/5.  Friendly and engaging, served their function by keeping drinks and food around, knowledgeable about the menu selections and parings with the beverage list.  Personality 4/5 .  This location has it's own little vibe, although you get the sense it is trying to be cool when it should just relax and be itself.  The location, ample shade, and open air concept is enough to be a nice canvas to paint a fun experience with friends without the pretentiousness.  Quality 5/5.  My group only had appetizers, and all of them were definitely a step up from what you would expect from a bar.  Being a little of a tapas fan, the (fill in the blank) boards are all great (of course that is more a function of the items they select for the boards as there isn't a ton of additional prep).  They do have a cergonia olive there that is definitely unique and tastes fantastic (oversized, taste like a cross between a black and green olive without the silly pimento).       Recommendation 4/5.  A nice spot to make your \"local\" go to hang out and have some drinks and light fare.",

When my partner and I started speaking Spanish and that's when we were discriminated against. I have had great experiences at Postinos and now it's become a very racial place.",

I think this was one of my favorite restaurants that I tried on this trip!  We came for brunch and sat outside. The patio is great and the weather was perfect that day. The patio also appeared to be dog friendly for those like me who like to bring their dog along! For food I got a couple of small plates: the one egg with bacon (got mine over medium, and it was perfect) along with the walnut toast with brie and berry preserves (at my friends recommendation and I am SO glad I tried it!). The walnut toast was out of this world. The combo of sweet and salty was perfect. I also got a couple of the peach bellinis, which was the perfect brunch drink and something a bit different than your average brunch mimosas.  The prices are super reasonable too. It may just be because I'm from the Bay Area and everything is insanely expensive here, but the fact that both my small plates only equaled to $7 total and each drink was only $5, I was floored at how cheap my meal was. Service was friendly and very fast. I will definitely be back to try some more things including their bruschetta next time I am in Phoenix!",

Perfect for a date or a ladies lunch! Honestly, it is an all around no brainer, because the staff are AHMAZING!

The staff was friendly and they were good at checking in and making sure we were pleased with the food and kept our drinks full.  Well, I suppose that's about the best of what I can say. There was little on the menu that really appealed to me, but the food was pretty good. Nothing to write home about... it actually looked much better than it tasted. Though, importantly, it tasted very fresh. A bit pricey for what felt like an appetizer. I actually left feeling a bit hungry.  The worst part was that they were blasting disco so loud, no one could hear each other speak. Terrible for Mother's Day...  Overall, I can see how it might appeal to some, but I definitely won't be going back.",

Waited over 20 minutes to order a second round of drinks and in order to do that had to flag him down and ask if it was ok to order more. The time we were there before this we were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes before asking a manager if we would be helped.   I've gone to postino for years and the last two experiences being ignored by the server are putting a stop to that. Perhaps it's lack of employees and being there at busy times but for a place like this you'd think they'd be staffed appropriately on busy weekends.",

I've definitely been back a few times and the bruschetta is getting more dry and chewy each time.

If you get there before five pm, all glasses of wine and pitchers of draft beer (2 pints worth) are only $5. A pitcher is still only $7.50 after 5pm.   As far as food goes there is a simple menu that is full of delicious flavors. You can order a board of bruschetta that allows you to pick 4 different kinds, 4 pieces each for $14. My favorites include green apple and Brie with fig, prosciutto with fig and mascarpone, and tomato jam and fresh sheeps milk cheese. Always fresh tasting, always delicious.   Besides the bruschetta there are a variety of salads and paninis, which you can also do a  mix and match combo on by doing a half order of each ($9.75).   If you come after 8pm on Mondays and Tuesdays you can get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20.   I've had brunch here a few times. While it's good I prefer to go to Fez about a mile south on Central.",

I've not had problems with service (food has been prompt within reason depending on the amount of customers); the servers are friendly, though I wouldn't classify the service as 'amazing'.   We usually go to Postino for Sunday brunch as a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids); the wait is reasonable (20-30 min), and the food is always quality.  We also drop in on random week nights for a date night- can't go wrong with the bruschetta board!  Thank you, Postino, for taking care of your Phoenix community.",

If you are looking for a bargain, go on a Monday or Tuesday night after 8pm - close for the special \"board and bottle\". It is a cutting board of bruschetta (mix and match from the various offerings) and choose a bottle of red or white from a surprisingly boutiquey list of reds and whites. All for $20. Yes, $20.  This place is also without pretense as the servers don't wear any particular uniform so they look very comfy. A must try!  The regular menu is tapas heavy with some salads and sandwiches mixed in.

They have paninis, soups, and salads, but my favorite is the bruschetta--so many flavors to choose from and they're all amazing.  I'd recommend heading down with two or three friends so you get to try even more of the options.",

    "text": "Absolutely fabulous - who knew bruschetta could be quite delicious? When my friend suggested Postino, I had little expectations. I know many people love bruschetta, but I usually find them (specifically, the bread) to be too hard or too soggy. A caprese salad with garlic bread would be tastier.   BUT Postino serves up extraordinary bruschetta (bruschetti?). We ordered two orders of the bruschetta + bottle of wine (what a deal! Just $20 per order after 8 PM) so we got to sample 8 of the 12 offerings in total. I love how each bruschetta was sliced into 4 so that we could share them easily.   Listed in order of faves:  (1) PROSCIUTTO WITH FIGS & MASCARPONE: Sweet and savory. The thin layer of saltiness paired wonderfully with the chewy and tang of the figs and the sweetness of the mascarpone.  (2) RICOTTA WITH DATES & PISTACHIOS: Totally unexpected and delicious. The nutty and buttery crunch of the pistachios paired with the chewy dates and the sweet ricotta = divine.  (3) SMOKED SALMON WITH PESTO: Really well balanced and tasty. (4) BRIE & APPLES WITH FIG SPREAD: The green apples were very fresh and elevated the rich brie.  (5) WARM ARTICHOKE SPREAD: Yummy! You could really taste the artichoke.  (6) BURRATA, BACON, ARUGULA & TOMATO: Tasty, and exactly like you would expect these combinations to taste like. Although the taste of the burrata was buried under the bacon. (7) ROASTED PEPPERS WITH GOAT CHEESE: Assertive goat cheese and great taste of the roasted peppers. (8) SEASONAL: We got a tomato jam one, which tasted like an elevated lunchables pizza spread. I used to have these almost everyday in middle school! Quite interesting.  If you are ordering one by yourself, I highly recommend (1) to (4) above! They are so interesting and the flavors come together to create scrumptious harmonies. Since I live across the country, I might try to recreate these flavors until I can come back and visit!",

The ambiance was nice for a date night, complete with fireplace outside.   Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is I didn't care for the autostrada panini much. It was a good sized sandwich but it just wasn't very toasted as it had barely notable grill marks and the meat and cheese were cool (I got the ciabatta bread) and despite the bread being good I felt like the bread to meat ratio was off: Too much bread and not enough meat or cheese.   Either way I would definitely come back and try something other than the panini. It was a nice experience overall. The gf was happy drinking her wine :)",

    "text": "Bruschetta.  How exciting is it really?  I have had it as an appetizer at many restaurants and I have made it at home.  Grilled bread with garlic and tomatoes, basil, olive oil and salt generally.  Well, the Postino restaurants have taken it to a completely different level.  It is, what I assume this chain of restaurants in AZ, is known for as there are pictures of their bruschetta boards everywhere.  And rightfully so.  Postino's bruschetta is unlike any bruschetta I have ever experienced.    On a recent visit to AZ, I made plans with my lovely friend, Karen W, to meet up in Phoenix at Postino Central.  This is one of two locations in Phoenix.  There are a total of seven Postino restaurants in AZ.  I was glad Karen researched this as this location is Phoenix has a parking lot behind it and on this very warm summer day, we decided to meet up when it opened for lunch at 11 a.m. and were able to find parking in this lot.  There is an outdoor patio, but as the weather was over 100 degrees already, all patrons were choosing to sit inside.  The restaurant has a bar at the back with seating and a community table next to it.  The rest of the dining area is comprised of a few booths and mostly table and chairs.  The hostess who seated us was war and inviting and welcomed us to the restaurant.    Our server was really nice and told us a bit about the menu.  My friend and I knew right away that we wanted to sample the famous bruschetta.  The board is comprised of four choices of bruschetta.  There are 12 types to choose from with one selection being seasonal.  It was hard to choose just four as they all sounded fantastic. We finally decided on the Warm Artichoke Spread, Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, and Burraat, Bacon, Arugula and Tomato.  We were undecided on our fourth and final choice.   I asked our server what his favorite bruschetta was and he said the Sweet & Spicy Pepper Jam with Goat Cheese.  We went with that as our fourth. Words cannot express how much I LOVED this bruschetta.  It was a sight to behold.   It was almost too beautiful to eat, almost ;)  First off, it is on thick slices of untoasted bread.  The four selections we picked were all fantastic but I would have to say, hands down, that the  Burrata, Bacon, Arugula and Tomato and the Warm Artichoke Spread were my favorites.  I am a sucker for Burrata cheese as it is one of my favorites and with the savory goodness of the bacon and combined with the arugula and tomato this was a winner in my book.  The Warm Artichoke spread was absolutely delicious, too.  I loved the creamy, flavorful goodness of this one.  In the future, I would seriously order two boards just to sample eight types of their bruschetta.   I also ordered a Butcher's Block, but it was kinda noisy in the restaurant as it was quite crowded on this weekday, and I think I distracted our server by asking him about his favorite bruschetta.   This was overlooked on our order but I ordered it again after we polished off the bruschetta.  The Butcher's Block was gorgeous.  That is one thing with dishes here is presentation is just beautiful, but the food tastes good too.  A board of artisan meats and cheese and hummus, nuts, olives and toast points.  It was very good.  I also ordered a Honey Cucumber Lemonade as my beverage.  I am a huge fan of cucumber and this was so refreshingly good on this very warm day.  I ordered a second.  There are no free refills on this drink.  They have an awesome selection of wine and other adult beverages here, but we opted to not imbibe this lunch.  The staff at Postino Central were all friendly, attentive and helpful.  Our glasses of water were kept filled which we appreciated, also.  I cannot say enough about this restaurant.  For a chain of seven restaurants, I was surely impressed with this location and wouldn't mind making my way to each of the other six locations in the future :)",

They have a bunch of different ones to choose from with a wide variety of fancy meats, cheeses, and spreads. Warm artichoke spread is for sure my favorite. They even offer gluten free bread! They also have a seasonal one so be sure to ask your server about that too.   Normally you can get a board and choose 4 for $15 but if you go after 8pm on Monday or Tuesday you can get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20! Such a good deal.   Also, be prepared for a wait. This place is always poppin'",

This is where postino's comes in.   The menu is full of salads, Paninis, bruschetta and a few apps. There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance.   Service here is great, the patio is quite nice with heaters, a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.  Great for a date, hanging with friends and conversation.  We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus. The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be. The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.  For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread, the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.  We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta. Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.  For desert we had a crem burle, simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.",

There were also a few fireplaces going. We had amazing service the entire time we were there and the staff was very attentive. I ordered bellinis to drink and they were delicious with a great peachy flavor that was very strong but not overpowering or overly sweet. We decided to split the mix greens salad and two orders of the bruschetta. For the bruschetta, we picked the brie and apples, prosciutto  with fig, warm artichoke, buratta bacon arugala, ricotta with dates, and smoked salmon with pesto. I honestly loved every bite of everything I ate here. Everything was well thought out to make sure each bite was splendid. I loved how each bruschetta had textural and flavor contrasts. The salad was also very delicious.  The pears and grapes were perfectly crisp and fresh. The candied pecans were a nice touch to the salad. The poppyseed vinaigrette was super tasty and very light. I loved it! I loved it here so much I went the following day to the annex location to have brunch!! No shame. If you haven't been here before, go. You are missing out!!!",

    "text": "I'm just realizing that I have WAY too many 5 star reviews but maybe it's just because I go to some amazing places.  This is one of those places.    To save whoever is reading this to consider going or not....  just go. Now.  You might want to consider making a reservation.  Stop reading this.  Run.    I effing love this place.  They do bruschetta like no one else does and their service and drinks are awesome too.  They are the rare triple threat- like if this restaurant were your girlfriend that you've been dating for only 6 months your mom would love her and all of your buddies would tell you to \"lock it down\".  Seriously that good.   My favorite bruschetta are the apple and brie and the \"classic\" tomato and mozzarella.  I generally get a pino grigio (house) or pino nior (house) depending on my mood.  I really need to try more of their menu but their bruschetta is so freaking good that I never get past it.    The normal every day deal is $14 for 4 different types of bruschetta.  It's a pretty big order- each bruschetta is about 4-5 inches long and it's cut into roughly 1 inch pieces so it's sharable and not messy.  I personally can fill up on just that but if you've got 3 people with bigger appetites you might want to order 2 orders.    You might want to consider making a reservation or be prepared to wait- in the evenings they get packed.    I moved from Phoenix to Reno this past year and this is the number 1 place I miss the most.  If they ever want to consider opening up a place here we have a superb foodie community and I know they would be welcome.    GO TO THIS PLACE NOW.",

Then had to wait another 15 to get our food order taken. Then our food came and we had to ask a couple times for silverware, and that took another 5-10 minutes to get. The bruschetta boards were delicious but a little too oily for me.  Overall a good first experience except the slow service. They weren't crazy busy but they may have been understaffed or something. I would go back and try it out again.",

There were also a large amount of flies in the restaurant.  While I do understand it is an open patio, flies would have been reasonable,  however gnats covering the walls by the restrooms is not. While eating, my.mother noticed something large moving behide the bar and back door to the patio,  it was a mouse, that ran outside into a shed of sorts. Again, i understand there will be some elements of nature that this type of restaurant will endure, this however,  crosses all lines of cleanliness. Grab a towel, some hot water and bleach and CLEAN this place up.",

Major bonus points to Postino for corking unfinished bottles so you can bring them home, too. I will definitely be back!!",

I loved the presentation, so elegant and gorgeous. The flavors melted together in my mouth in harmony.   I got the Hannah's Field salad as my entree, which had amazing textures and complementary flavors. Definitely recommend if you're not feeling a full meal.   My cousin and his boyfriend seem to frequent this place, and I can definitely understand why. The ambiance on a Friday night was trendy, with clientele in their mid 20s- 40s. Classy without being snooty. Intimate without the claustrophobia. It's definitely a place you go to for both the food and the environment. The whole package is a winner and I only wish I lived closer to Postino!",

The bread is quality bread that's light and crispy which really made all the difference in the world. The eggs, ham and gruyere on top was cooked perfectly. They also serve it with cherry tomatoes on the side and most of them are green cherry tomatoes which really was a perfect compliment to this dish. I really was impressed. Wanted a mimosa but was still a little dehydrated from the beer from the night prior. Will definitely have to come back and eat/drink more vittles here.",

    "text": "Totally love this place. Visited it on a Friday after work with my parents, brother, and boyfriend. We were greeted warmly and quickly, put on the wait list and escorted to the outdoor patio which was busy. As we waited, my Mom, bro and myself shared a delicious and refreshing bottle of a white blend wine. I'm not a huge fan of whites but on a hot afternoon, it was fantastic. We weren't even finished with our first glasses and we were seated at a nice little table near the front windows. Although it was a little tight for 5 people, a bottle (and ice tub) of wine, and then tons of food to follow; our waitress made it comfortable and kept us all happy! It was great!  To start we shared the pub board and a plate of some of the delicious bruschetta; brie with apples and fig spread, warm artichoke spread, white bean and chopped tomato, and the fresh mozzarella,tomato and basil. The pretzels were mouth watering, buttery and salty. A Sierra Nevada mustard came along with and was just spicy enough. All of the bruschetta was delicious but the apple and fig, as well as the white bean and tomato both stood out. Different ideas and tasty unique flavors together. Great combinations!  For our main course, we shared some sandwiches; my brother and Mother had the Tuna, while my boyfriend and I had the prosciutto with brie. This also had the fig on it and I couldn't get enough of it! My Pops had the raspberry chicken salad, which was also delicious.   We didn't have dessert but we did have a bottle of the wine on tap. It was a white (once again, not a huge drinker of white, so I'm not sure what kind) that was again, delicious. It was very crisp, had some bubble to it and wasn't too heavy on the honey flavor; what I deam my theory on white wines (they all taste a bit like honey).  Although I've never visited the original in Arcadia, I will definitely head back here in the future (especially because I work south of Camelback on Central!!! Thanks Postinos!",

I have been here a handful of times and every server I have had has an excuse of why they cannot meet my requests. I understand a policy of not splitting checks, but then please let us know that when you are taking our order. One of the servers also told me that they cannot seat parties of five without a reservation. I understand having to wait for a table, but the place was just opening and nearly empty at the time. The menu also gives very vague descriptions making it nearly impossible for anyone with specific food allergies. I love my wine, but I am pretty comfortable with the fact that I will never go to this place again.",

You absolutely MUST have the brie, apple, and fig sauce bruscetta! You will literally be licking the board, it is just so delicious!   I am not usually one for wine bars (I don't drink wine, but my boyfriend does) and the wine was almost expensive per glass as the food, but he said it was worth it. If you are prepared to spend $9+ a glass, then it's worth every cent. It's not much from the outside, which actually almost deterred us, but don't turn back! It's dark and romantic, but also edgy and hipster-ish.   They have $20 bruscetta and bottle of wine nights on Monday and Tuesday after close, and I cannot wait to go back.

Been here at least a handful of times since they opened earlier this year and i've had everything from brunch to apps to lunch, dinner and dessert. The staff all knows their stuff when it comes to the wines, so they can always find you something you'll love (had the Grayson Cab recently, 2 thumbs up!).  The bruschetta is fool-proof. My faves are the Roasted Red Pepper w/goat cheese and the Tomato Jam w/sheep's milk cheese. The Warm Artichoke and the Brie w/Apples are a very close second. Go a bunch of times and try them all. You won't be disappointed. If you do the Mon-Tues board & bottle, its like getting the board for free! Why not!?  Paninis and salads are good.  I've had the B.E.L.T. from the brunch menu and sampled the bf's Ciabatta French Toast... both delish! On most recent visit tried the Mozz & Tomatoes Jr and i might be hooked. I had to create my own at home!  The Salted Caramel Sundae is by far their best dessert. Vanilla ice cream w/ choc-covered corn nuts and a pretzel rod, served with a big shot of salted caramel to pour over as you eat it... Soooo goood!!! Join their club online to get a free bruschetta board too!",

    "text": "I was here...  you guessed it.. Saturday night. I have been drooling/dreaming about/over the pictures of their cheese plates and bruschetta since frequenting yelp. Every weekend I would put off going swearing I would get there next time. I finally made it and was absolutely not disappointed.  I tend to stay away from super trendy places as my cheat meals generally include at least two places and a small time window. The wait is usually really long and although the service is usually good the food wait time is usually up there.  I came fully prepared to wait for a while and for mediocre to bad service based on the reviews I've read. I was pleasantly surprised on both topics. We were instantly greeted at the door by a very nice/enthusiastic hostess. She apologized that they couldn't seat us right away and helped us find a comfortable place to stand and wait for a table. The wait was about 15-20 minutes. Fearing the service I had read about I was keeping an eye for open tables. One opened and the hostess quickly cleared it and was showing us to our seat within a few moments of the table freeing up.  Our waitress was at our table asking about drinks within 2 minutes of sitting down. We ordered and drinks and appetizers right away. One of the apps hit the table within 5 minutes. The only complaint I have is that it was another 5 before the rest came out. Better to serve it all at once.  In summary the service was GREAT. Total opposite of what I prepared myself for.  Onto the Food:  \"The Plate\": An assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini. Absolutely delicious. There was a huge variety of olives. The goat cheese was a little ripe for my liking but that's just a personal thing. The dish needs to be served with a little more bread then was provided.  Bruschetta: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone Warm Artichoke Spread Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese Salami with Pesto  I'll spare you all super details. Just know that its all worthwhile. There were two in particular that the whole table loved. I'm not even sure \"loved\" is a strong enough word. You absolutely must try \"Brie & Apples with Fig Spread\" and \"Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone.\" Freaking delicious!  They are running a special now for an order of Bruschetta and a bottle of house wine for $20 mon-tue. This is one heck of a deal and a great way to get a little drunk and try the food on the cheap. Go and thank me later :)",

    "text": "My partner and I took a stroll to try Postino Central for the first time.  By walking there we didn't have to worry about parking.  Postino's does have valet in case you were wondering.  There is a neighborhood directly behind the restaurant and the home owners put out pylons and road barricades to keep customers from parking in front of there driveways.  Parking is tight at Postino's so if you have to end up parking in the neighborhood have some consideration for the home owners.  I am sure they are annoyed with all the traffic.  Enough said about that.  Postino Central has had huge crowds since it opened.  My partner and I put off going until the novelty of the place wore off.  Guess what.  It hasn't worn off.  It is a great restaurant/bar and hangout.  We went later in the evening and there was a big crowd.  I tried the bruschetta.  I ordered a half order.  There are 11 choices of bruschetta.  Take your pick.  To drink I ordered a Cucumber Honey Lemonade.  Yum.  No alcohol for me that night.  My partner ordered the NYC Grilled Cheese.  So simple but delicious.  We went back to Postino's that same week.  Another large crowd.  They are doing something right there.  -good service -wine list -full bar indoor/outdoor -patio -valet  Both times I have been there I ordered and Iced Cafe Mocha to go for the stroll home.  By walking there and back it felt like I was in NYC walking to my favorite hang out.  We will definitely frequent Postino Central.  This place is a Hot Spot for many reasons.  Check it out.",

    "text": "That's some damn good bruschetta. For those of you that are not a fan of the tomato persuasion, you know how comforting it is lately to see bruschetta that does not contain tomatoes. Not only does Postinos offer great alternatives, they are divine. My favorite by far though, is the one with pistachios, though I devoured them all. Second fave, roasted red bell pepper. Mmmmmm. Okay need to stop thinking about that. Already had breakfast and am craving food again.   Our server was super nice and attentive. I felt like I was at a resort being pampered, not out for a brunch with friends. When my champagne, honey cucumber lemonade concoction erupted like Mt. St. Helens and not even the champagne drink champion could down it in time, he promptly came back with a towel to clean the table up. LOVE!  The country toast was mouth watering. I was a bit surprised to see tomato salad on my plate as I didn't see it listed with the item on the menu, but meh. It can easily be pushed aside. More things should come without tomato as a default garnish though.  I ate every last bit of my food and consumed my entire champagne beverage. Not sure that last part is surprising to anyone at all.  The outdoor patio is beautiful though a really tight fit. We were pretty close to a cactus... almost too close for comfort.  Will I be back? More than likely.",

    "text": "I heart Postino.   It's not always my fave but I'm always happy I chose it in the end.   A few girlfriends and I recently light-railed up here and a glass turned into a bottle...into just splitting one more glass...and then another bottle...and then some port. God bless light rail.   We started by each getting a glass of something different to help us decide which bottle to buy (crafty system, eh?) When we decided mine was delish and ordered the bottle.  The server informed us that the wine I was served was actually different from what I pointed to on the menu. ??  Turns out they ran out and what I got was actually a huge upgrade...so they honored the price of the original printed bottle and we enjoyed an amazing wine. Gotta love that.   Everyone knows the bruschetta is the bomb- I'm the biggest fan of the prosciutto/fig and the others try to be just as good. This time I was pleasantly surprised by the salmon pesto and warm artichoke.   We also had The Plate- which I've had twice now with meats and cheeses and each time I do I think \"d'oh!\" why didn't we just get cheese? There's barely enough on the plate to split and white bean hummus is a little underwhelming...next time, wino, just get the cheese plate.   I've also never had the salted caramel dessert...which sorta lived up to it's name. They warm caramel in a shot glass and serve it next to a scoop of vanilla with some pretzels as garnish. It was sorta cheating since I was dreaming of a fleur de sal concoction, but the pretzel/caramel combo was still tasty.",

We arrived at about 8pm and were seated right away.  The place kinda sorta looks just like their other location and had the same chill vibe going on.  The service was fast and friendly as always.  We each had a glass of wine and split the grilled cheese (totally random I know).  I am always impressed with their wine selection.  They have some good stuff that will appeal to just about everybody and it is all reasonably priced.  Anyway, the wine was good and the grilled cheese was just ok.  I'm not a fan of grilled cheese where the bread is real crispy and big.  Also, I'm not sure of the cheese they used but I wasn't a fan either.  It was just eh.  It wasn't horrible, but I won't order it again.  Hmmmm....maybe if it came with a bowl of tomato soup ....  My only gripe about this location as well as their other one is the parking.  It is ALWAYS a clusterfuq.  I mean good for them for always being so busy, but it really is a pain in the ass.",

    "text": "Lemme say this first:  1) If you frequent this place EVERY DAY after work with your husband, or even every weekend you have FAR too much $$ and I'd like your healthplan, please. Jesus!  2) Phoenix: you gotta stop handing out 5 star reviews like clinics hand out penicillin during flu season. You make it WAAAYYYY too easy.   3)Please don't \"hoorah\" the end of Katz Deli. It was a good place. Kind of scary to see Phoenix starting to erase it's own history little by little.  UPDATE: And a star downgrade. Been here several times, and decided to take my mom for lunch. The wait was 5 minutes...not a prob! Then we were crammed in what seemed to be the last corner of the restaurant - inches...and i mean INCHES away from the next table occupied by three guys. Cozy. Water? check....Menus? check.... Waiter?....waiter?......ten minutes pass before we have to flag someone down. We order hummus first and salads to follow. The hummus arrives, and the guy spills half of it on a chair, sets the rest down for us to start on, and disappears. Another 10 minutes pass. No cleanup, no replacement of the smooshed half of the hummus. Flag down another person - he's clearly annoyed as we ask \"what's going on here today? We still don't have the other have of our appetizer. This is bad service\". Pretty-boy McSnarky-face replies, and I quote,...\"can we just get past all this negativity and move forward together and put this behind us?\"  He's serious. He dashes away and we never see him again.  Almost another 10 minutes later, other half of hummus arrives. Previous mess gets cleaned. Then our salads come. Then so does every single other waiter in the restaurant in five minute intervals (to ask 'how we are'...in that really uncomfortable \"someone in charge told me to come to your table and be nice even though this isn't my section but I actually don't give a shit\" way). This gets awkward...and annoying and embarrassing all at once. We just wanna eat and I just wanna have some nice afternoon time with my mom because she happens to be an incredible person.  Long story longer: the manager arrives to talk with us about this no-so-nice experience. He is very focused and thoughtful and attentive. He's not happy to hear about McSnarky-face's little spiel (as well he shouldn't be). He comps our meal...which was NOT our intention because we ate it and it was really good. An odd day.  Won't be rushing back to Postino as readily in the future. Service really can wreck a lot of things. When they hire more based on actual service abilities and friendliness rather than who \"looks\" the best next to the leather seats in the dining room, I might visit. Their staff, for the most part, comes off as annoyingly self-involved. Yeah - pretty people are fun to look at: but it's more important that they're good at what they do...and some here aren't, from what I've experienced in the times I've visited.  as if all the Scottsdalers aren't annoying enough",

There were others who arrived around the same time.     Though there were plenty of seats, we had to wait a while to talk to a server and then we waited for our meals to arrive.     They later explained that they had a crush of ten orders.    OK.    That happens.  They got my order wrong.    Sandwich made with the \"other\" bread.   That wasn't what bothered me.        It would have been nice if they had served me anyway and asked if it was ok.     After all, we had waited a looooooong time already.     I would have been fine with the \"other\" bread.  Give me the choice.  Ah, you say, the server would have had to CARE about you as a customer to think this through!     But the servers don't care.        And that is the problem with Postino Central.     The food is ok, not spectacular.    The servers don't care.     And they make that clear with their inattention.",

MMMMMM!  yes, it's pricey, but most of these trendy spots tend to be.  The last time i came, we ordered The Plate and The Salumi as starters. The Salumi is good, but hello, what a stingy little plate! I think 3 little slices of bread, 3 slices of salumi, one little glob of burrata, and 1 baby roasted tomato cut up.... there were 6 of us. SIGH. The plate is good, but again, skimpy! I had ordered the same Plate about a month prior and it was NOT that pathetic.  $5 mimosas always please everyone. and wine is $5 a glass every day from 11-5pm.   anyways, as always, the bruschetta pleased the masses. And I will come back, when i have visitors. or when i get another gift card.",

Easily the best deal in the house. The variety guarantees that you have nearly endless different combinations. Did I mention they have wine & beer too? An excellent global selection of each at standard wine bar pricing. But there are deals to be had at Postinos as well. It's not difficult to enjoy a glass of $9 wine for $5. The Monday Tuesday after deal of $20 for a bruschetta board & a bottle of any house wine will keep you out late on a school night.",

    "text": "Seriously, Postino... seriously?  I came here with some friends on Tuesday and it was honestly one of the most infuriating dining experiences of my life. First of all, I understand we came on their busiest night.  Bruschetta and a bottle for $20 great deal. I was expecting a wait when I got here, and I was told 30-40 min.  I waited an hour and a half.  I would have left, but they started a bottle of wine for us which we drank while waiting.  We were figuring on the wait they quoted when we got the bottle, and had I known, I wouldn't have started the bottle.  We waited and watched as people who arrived after us were seated first. I guess our look wasn't hip enough for their Jean-claude Van dam impersonator host. After an hour we got so sick of standing in the damn parking lot that we took a seat on the blacktop, at which point jcvd came up and said we can't sit on the pavement, but we were moR than welcome to sit in the couches that already had occupants.  Maybe he checked with the people in the couches first and got their approval for us to go sit in their laps, but we weren't go ing to test it out.  We went back to standing.   When we finally got inside, it took a good 10 minutes to get our wine brought over to us, at which point it was at room temperature. The food was great as usual, but the service continued to suck throughout. After we got our check, it took a good 15 minutes for them to let us pay.  At no point was anything offered to us to apologize for the twice as along as quoted wait time other than a half assed sorry and a smirk.  \"everybody is just hanging out extra long tonight\" was the recurring line.   We saw people get seated, and finish before we were seated.  It was ridiculous. Somebody at that restaurant needed to learn something about restaurant management.  When you have a table sitting for two and a half hours, maybe you should say, \"we need the table\". In fact they actually do that.  They did it to a party I was in a few weeks ago there.  So why Was it ok to do with my party but not with the tables on Tuesday. We had no problem clearing out to make room for other patrons. Postino is a great place, usually, but this terrible service cannot be excused.  heads out of asses... Quickly please.",

The space is rather nice--keeping with the wide open windows, lots of natural light thing the other location has. However, something just didn't sit right with me whenever I ordered anything to eat that wasn't their famous bruschetta. My sandwiches either came out wrong or were just average and the Tuscan white bean soup I had here one time was, for lack of a better word, gross. I like the burrata appetizer though, which I never really tried at the other location. Nice and creamy. The wine is decent, but not amazing and it's nice and empty here earlier on in the day. The bartenders are nice and the prices are right, but if I had the extra time, then I'd be over in the Arcadia neighborhood soaking up the sun on the patio instead.",

My sister and I went here for a casual Saturday afternoon lunch. We started with the bruschetta and it was freakin amazing! You get to choose four kinds but we got 2 of the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone and the roasted peppers with goat cheese. They were so good that we decided to ditch ordering salad and get another bruschetta board. This time we did kind of a wildcard mixture. One of my favorites was the ricotta with dates and pistachios. It sounds weird but is really tasty. For drinks they have tons of wine choices but if you want a great non-alcoholic alternative the cucumber honey lemonade is terrific. I recommend this place because the food is so good but bring your patience for the parking and slow service.",

She was a lady and only ate half of her food, while I was a little piggy and ate up all my panini and salad!  Not because I was hungry, but because it tasted good.  Threw my damn 860 calorie a day fling way out the window. I was ok with it.  A beautiful little spot decor was nice, although I wish I would have had a friendlier wait staff, they seemed rather pretentious and uppety for being servers.  Its cool to be good looking at a swanky spot in uptown Phx and all, but not too cool to bring this \"way too hot for you\" attitude to work, and make people feel like crap as you throw their plate on the table.  I suggest smile more, be more humble, and enjoy being friendly.  Its nice sometimes! Overall though a cute spot, I'll visit again and hope there is better service.",

My group arrived before me but the hostess refused to seat them because the person who took my reservation spelled my name wrong so my reservation was for Kirsten not Christine. The hostess thought that somehow the same amount of people showed up at the exact same time as \"Kristen's\" party and that my friends somehow knew this and we're stealing the reservation, REALLY! The hostess told my friends that they would have to wait to make sure \"Kristen\" didn't show up. She also refused to call the phone number they had on the reservation. The manager temporarily redeemed herself be offering a comp bruschetta board. Then the bar windows were opened. It is the end of June so the temp inside instantly shot up and we all started sweating. It was probably cooler outside with the misters. I have now learned my lesson; I will no longer come during summer months and always expect to be treated like I am inconveniencing the staff.",

Very, very good.  I am a huge cheese, wine, and brushetta person so this place is literally my heaven.  The only thing I'm knocking a star off for is the staff.  I've been there a few times and some of the staff could be rude and snobby, and one instance that irked me was when I talked to the server about adding burratta to my order, he basically charged me for the whole plate (burratta, olives, salamis, etc) and didn't add it on to the big appetizer plate, like I thought he would.  No big deal, I just wished that he would have explained it was a separate appetizer plate since we had so much food!  Overall, still my favorite place in Phoenix.",

It has allowed me to perfectly time getting off work on a Tuesday night, dropping my car off with the valet, and finding a seat just in time for the 8pm-this of course begins the $20 bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta celebration! The service here is always spectacular. The waiters are very knowledgeable with the wine menu and are patient with helping you make the best decision. My friends and I believe there is some sort of conspiracy involving the water glasses, the \"water boy\" is so attentive that I will have but a sip of water and he has returned to top me off. I understand that the bruschetta is not a complicated thing to specialize in, they do it so well. Brie and apples, prosciutto w/ figs, smoked salmon, salami w/ pesto-all my favorites-equally! The atmosphere really is what makes this place even more fantastic! The outdoor seating is fabulous, but limited, and this goes for both locations. I must admit that it can be a bit obnoxious to not only valet your car when it is parked 10 feet from your seat outside, especially when the valley insists on driving it to you...?? Also, it can be a bit of a wait at times and the hostess could use some lessons in approximating the wait time, but I tell myself to relax and grab something to drink while I wait. I mean, can you really put a time limit on a table sharing an outstanding bottle of wine and good conversation?..I think not...",

However there is another blonde older woman who is always very nice and fun to be waited on by her. She was northers today and we got seated in this servers section near the restrooms and i can see why that's her section.  Another thing who is cooking the eggs over easy here? Because they can learn a thing or two from hula's down the street who can make an egg over easy. But because my wife likes this place sometimes we came here. The eggs were over cooked and brought on two separate plates.  Why they couldn't put two eggs on one plate is for the owner to figure out. I didn't complain because I would rather share my experiance here with all of you.  Postinos normally good service food is ok but that blonde server on Sunday placed a sour note on breakfast.

    "text": "The food was good.  It wasn't awe inspiring by any means, but the flavor choices were well paired and the wine and beer selection is excellent.  The atmosphere was great too.  It's a younger crowd, really happening, and seems like a great place to grab a drink.  Where they failed miserably was in the service.  It's clear from the start they're trying to turn over tables asap (which I realize is part of the point from a business perspective, but making that obvious is a huge turnoff).  The waitress came to our table 3 times before we were ready to order, all within the span of the first 5 minutes, before we had even received our 1st drinks.  Once she brought the apps out, she vanished.  Another server brought us our entrees while we were still HALFWAY THROUGH our apps.  That may sound picky, but it's a huge pet peeve of mine.  When we finally got finished with our apps, I needed another drink.  Unfortunately our original server never came back to the table until I was done with my entree, at which point another drink was moot.  Terrible service overshadowed good food.",

    "text": "Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.  Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!  Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.  My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.  I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.  I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!",

Thanks for valet parking...looks like it couldn't happen any other way in this neighborhood.  Great design of the floor and seating.  Just a handsome restaurant.    I really like old style al fresco dining and the lunch menu looks like it was designed to be just that.  We chose the antipasti board and a bruschetta board....antipasti was very nicely presented and had a variety of cheese, meats, white bean tapenade, goat cheese, great olives, yellow sundried tomatoes and some cracker like crostini....we chose the tomato jam, fig proscuitto, artichoke and tuna bruschetta...enjoyed both very much.    The highlight of the meal was the Spanish Grenache which was the wine buyers special choice on the menu.  He picked it right!  It's been awhile since enjoying a Spanish wine and this one is good....earthy, almost taste the barrel and the earth the grapes were grown in, great fruit and acidity.    Service was excellent!  They even offered us a glass of water to go while we waited for the valet.  They even provide hand bag stands for the ladies made out of steel...nice touch!",

    "text": "The food here is good, and the wine list is great. I recommend any of their bruschetta. The Postino exclusive red wine, Stage Dive pinot noir, is also excellent. The reason they only get 3 stars from me is because I bought a bottle of Stage Dive to go today, and the server brought me Rickshaw pinot noir (in a paper bag) instead. I didn't notice until I got home. When I called the restaurant, they told me they were all out of Stage Dive and the Rickshaw was their substitute, and they didn't know when they'd get more Stage Dive. Servers need to tell customers this when they try to buy Stage Dive, because not only is Rickshaw nowhere near as good, but it retails for $5-$6 less in stores than what they're charging at Postino. Inform your customers as to what they're buying! Or at least forgo the paper bag so they can see the switcheroo rather than trusting they got what they ordered and paid for.",

I did not expect to get the quality service that I did because I assumed that the staff would be overwhelmed. This was not the case. The service, recommendations and the bruschetta were all fantastic! Though a friendly and energetic woman named Maya was my server, I was helped by a total of four people without solicitation (while the place was still slammed with customers).

Anyway, the best time to come is on Monday or Tuesday at about 7:40.  This way you will get seated at around 8 when magical o' clock happens.  this when you can pay $20 for a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine.  Seriously, the deal is so great you will find yourself getting three of these pairings and Postino will gain all there money back.  But nevermind that.  Let's dwell on the bruschetta.  My favorite is the prosciutto.  The tomato jam, mozzarella with tomato basil, and brie and apples are always quite stellar.  They also have this new burrata with bacon that should make a welcome addition to my usual board rotation.  Can't go wrong with the wines, but ask your server for a recommendation as the men in plaid (yes, all the men wear plaid) are usually never wrong.  If you are so lucky as to come on a day when they are serving corn chowder, then you must high five your future self by ordering a bowl.  Oh, yea.  The patio is amazing with the fireplace and their giant bar  is both inside and outside and the inside has all the couches and intimate lighting and wine racks.  The only downsides are the necessary valet and the ugly Circle K across the street.",

I would pay to be able to park it myself. Postino (both locations) has the smallest parking lot and it is all Valet. This did not start us in a good mood as we drove around the neighborhood looking for parking.  We got there just as Brunch was winding down. I had my eye on the French Toast, so we went ahead and placed an order. We both had French Toast and Bacon and Bellini's. The food was very good, but over priced when you add it all up. The place was crowded and we had to sit at the bar and the service was not the best.  I really hate to sound like I don't like this Postino, because the food is certainly good and it is a nice building. Some of the staff is much better than others and I think Brunch is just chaos here as small as it is anyway. I do recommend going here but just take the negatives into account and you should have a good time.",

We chanced upon Postino as one of the few places open before 10am on Sun.  I'm glad we found the place.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with salad and tomatoes and my husband had the ciabatta french toast.  Both of our dishes were fantastic, though portions were smallish but overall decent value for the price/quality.  Our coffee and mimosa were great too--mimosa way more champagne than OJ as it should be. My complaint here was with the service.  I didn't realize that the restaurant's specialty is bruschetta and that they also serve the full menu on Sunday morning; nor did I realize that if you want bread with your breakfast you need to order bruschetta.  Our waiter never said a thing.  He seemed more interested in \"looking the part\" and I had to ask that he take our order at one point after we'd both been seated more than 10 minutes at a non-busy time. To top it all off, when we asked for the check, I was handed a bill padded with an extra drink and breakfast item--really, really BAD. I do see a return trip here, however, as the food is really, really well prepared from very fresh-tasting ingredients.  But WATCH THE BILL HERE, KEEP TRACK OF WHAT YOU ORDER.",

The food & wine is the same at both places-EXCELLANT!! The service at the Central location was pathetic! The young female waitress was not very knowledgeable about the wines and acted like she didnt feel like discussing or offering anything other than the wine special. (bad attitude). She was very annoying and persistant about getting our drink order as soon as we sat down and before we could even look at the menu or discuss. We had asked to wait to order until our last guest arrived at the table, but she requested our drink orders 3 times in about 8 minutes, so we finally just ordered a quick glass. She was also pretty good at interrupting the tables conversation throughout the night.  I ordered the olives for an appetizer and by the time my meal came, I still had not received my olives. I mentioned to our server that I had not received my olives, but that it was ok and to just 'skip them'.  She looked at me and said,   \"I brought them!! They are right here!!\" as she reached down to the OPPOSITE end of the long table from where I was sitting and gave me a half empty bowl of olives that the other ladies had already eaten. (Not the ladies fault, as they thought they were set on the table for everyone like a bread basket.)   I was appalled, especially since the half eaten olives did not come with an apology, they only came with a price tag. (Thats right, she didnt even take it off the bill for me!)

Great addition to the neighborhood as this \"hood\" seems to be an up and coming area with new restaurants and revitalization.    I would really give Postino Central 5 stars, but I feel that the wines offered by the glass are only worth $5 as they are offered during the day.  They have done a good job making customers believe that they are getting a good deal at this price while this is what they should be priced at anyway.  It's not a huge complaint of mine, I just know what these wines really cost.  Overall this place should be on anyone's list of places to check out and experience \"Uptown's\" new swagger feel!",

Its the most popular days to go on but only after 8pm. The wait can be brutal if you go at 8pm or even before 8pm. So, if you're in no hurry to eat or drink, then by all means wait. The bruschetta is amazing, you CANNOT go wrong with whatever variety you choose. For some reason I always get carded (good reason- makes me feel 21) so I make sure to bring my ID but on one occasion I couldn't find it and brought my passport.  I showed the bartender my passport and he said it was expired, (you would think I would know better than to bring an expired ID), So I told him it wasn't expired and he argues with me for a solid 5 minutes and proceeds to tell me I needed to renew it. It was until he realized after arguing back and forth that it wasn't expired and he looked like an idiot so he pretty much gave me my drink and avoided me the entire time.  Another time I went to this same location with my sister and her daughter during the day. We were ignored for 20 minutes before anyone attending to us and asking if we were going to order food.

I arrived on a Wednesday night, and only valet parking was available.  The servers/hosts inside were so nice and attentive.  The restaurant was dimly lit; there were stringed lights in the outdoor seating area.  The ambiance was nice and classy.  Yelp says they are casual attire; it's like more classy attire.  Try not to show up in shorts or flip flops..   Postino is a great place for wine and small plates.  I can't say much about the wine, but the food was great.  I tried the bruschetta.  For $14, you can try 4 flavors.  All of the flavors I tried were amazing; they were so PERFECT.  I've never had such combination of flavors elsewhere, and I wish Postino would open up in southern California (it's only 4 hours away!).. my favorite was the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone - salty but sweet at the same time!  I also tried the Baker's Block.  They serve it literally on a block with pieces of everything.  It's like an appetizer sampler.  It's good to try, but it wasn't the star of the evening.    Just thinking about it is making me salivate!  I want to go back..",

Oh and get this, Mondays and Tuesdays after 8pm you can get a house bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20.    Thank goodness it's walking distance from the lightrail.   We share their cheese board and get bruschetta.  You get to choose four when ordering so it's a nice variety.  We got the brie and apples with fig spread, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone,  roasted peppers with goat cheese, and burrata, bacon, arugula and tomato.  Previously I did the pick two and got the Italian picnic salad: fresh greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette, and the autostrada:  sopresatta, Italian ham, cappicola, mortadella, provolone, arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish.  Both so good, and they paired very well.  It's the perfect go to place when trying to figure something out in the area.",

Had a red pepper and corn soup...excellent and our party had procutio and brie paninis and a tuna panini. Everything was very good and reasonably priced. By the way, their iced tea was great. Best I've had for some time.",

    "text": "First time today for lunch with a dear friend.  Wonderful place.  Had the vegetarian panini.  It was served on either focaccia bread or ciabatta bread.  I chose focaccia and it was the best!  You can't even tell that it was a vegarian sandwich.  Wonderful flavors and the accompanying salad was delish.  Salad is tossed with pine nuts in a flavorful vinigrette.  Our friend had their mixed green salad and it looked fantastic.  Appeared to have honey roasted pecans mixed in.  Hubby had the turkey panini on ciabatta bread.  He paired his sandwich with Yukon potato chips, which was very good.  Overall, this place gets my vote for several return visits so I can try other menu items -- like their bruchetta.  A must visit and dine place if you are ever in Phoenix.",

I explained that we had a grandmother with us and if at all possible we would like for for he to not stand in the heat. They were wonderful and held a table for us. Brunch was very good. The egg dishes were well done and everything was well presented. All agreed that the food was terific. We will definitely return. They had some specials posted like a bottle of wine and bruchettes for $20 that looked great and we learned about 5$ pitchers of beer before 5PM every day!! What's not to love! Get some!",

I freakin' loved this place, now I know why my very good friend Holly basically LIVES at this restaurant!!!!  Food:  + Bruschettas. We did 4. #1 Tomato jam, chives, fresh Sheep's milk cheese. #2 Fresh mozzarella, basil and tomato. #3 Ricotta, pistachio and dates. #4 Brie and apples with fig spread.  They were all absolutely fantastic, my favorite was the classic fresh mozz with basil and tomato. The tomato and jam one provided for a very interesting twist to something you're not usually combining and eating. The creamy ricotta paired quite well with the very crunch pistachio and soft gooey dates. Brie and apples with fig...nuff said. + Butcher's Block. $14. An assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini. This was a great board, beautifully presented and man did it pair well with the beers and wines we ordered. Very well put together - loved the gherkins, loved the meats and brie, loved the presentation and Parmesan shards in the hummus.  By far, my favorite place I went to in Phoenix and I highly suggest you go here, sit outside and enjoy LIFE, for several hours, like I did.  THIS has been a review by Gaurav",

That being said, it's worth digging up a spot and waiting in line to get in.  Wonderful wine... what can I say? You will easily find something you like on the menu. There's plenty of beer to go around if that's your thing. Also, the bellinis are really yummy!  For food, I usually stick to the bruschetta. Mix and match to your heart's desire. My favorites are fresh tomato with mozzarella and basil, roasted peppers with goat cheese, and smoked salmon with pesto.  Sit outside if the weather is nice. You will not be disappointed!",

We ordered the Bruschetta, which came with four choices. Great variety there. We made ours gluten free but you'd never have guessed. It was warm, soft and seasoned well. The toppings were well thought out and executed.   We also split a Turkey Panini, which, when combined with the Bruschetta, was plenty for both of us. We actually couldn't finish it. The Panini was also on gluten free bread. It had pesto, tomato and greens and was savory and hearty.   The atmosphere at Postino's was interesting: When we arrived, there was a 15-30 min wait. When we left, it was 1/4 full. Remind you, it was Saturday night.   We will plan many return trips to Postino's on Central. Very good dinner.",

I ordered the warm artichoke, brie and apples with fog spread, almond hummus with chopped tomato, and roasted peppers with goat cheese for the bruschetta. For the wine, I ordered the Biancavigna. I definitely recommend coming here for great food and service.",

I came here on a Tuesday evening and it was still really busy! I wanted to eat inside because it's so hot during the summer but I didn't want to wait so we ate outside. Outside wasn't too bad because it was around 6pm so the sun was going down and they turn on the misters for the outside patio. My favorite thing to get is the Bruschetta. I like the option of having to choose what you want to eat. It comes with 4 choices. We got the Smoke Salmon with Pesto, Burrata Bacon Arugula with no tomatoes, Salami with Pesto, and the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato Basil. The Bruschetta alone doesn't fill you up. It's more like a snack than anything. My personal favorite was the Salmon and the Bacon. The only thing I don't really like is that the place is really small and $15 for a snack isn't really worth it. But overall I like this place and would come back here again.",

There's seating indoors and outdoors. The vibes are chill. I can't believe I haven't gone back (will definitely be going sometime soon as writing this review made me realize how much I enjoyed myself there).  Parking can be hectic because this location is in a hotspot in Central Ave near a bunch of high profile restaurants.",

They also have a wide variety of bruschetta and you can choose FOUR of them when you order the bruschetta platter. I tried the Brie and Apples (meh), burrata-bacaon-argula-tomato (tasty but salty), artichoke spread (tasty) and goat cheese with peppers (MY FAVORITE). The platter is huge and is perfect to share with others. There is a seasonal option which I've heard is very good as well. I must go back to try their charcuterie spread! Also to try the rest of the bruschetta. It is definitely a hip spot with a very chill atmosphere. Service was great! I really like it.  Be advised since the entrance and main parking lot is located in back, it can be hard to find at first. Additionally, the lot is SMALL and there is limited street parking since it is located close to a residential area. There is more parking available across the street in the same plaza as Churn, which is nice but a tad inconvenient. Solid 4 stars for me!",

I wanted something like a burger and this was NOT the place for that! I got a half beef roast sandwich and a cup of cream of Brussels sprouts and asparagus soup. Sarah got the bruschetta. The soup was delicious (not because I was hungry) and the sandwich was really good! But what was amazing was the bruschetta! Sarah, always the ever-sharer, shared half of her bruschetta with me. The salmon caper bruschetta and the pepper jam with goat cheese bruschetta was mind blowingly delicious! The tomato basil fresh mozzarella bruschetta was incredibly fresh and the ricotta with dates and pistachios was the perfect dessert! I'm using this forum to apologize to my fiance and I want everyone to know that she's always right! :)",

Meals here are an ordeal, and not just stuffing your face. Easily spend 2-3 hours here just chatting, eating, and drinking. The ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars is because one time we went and it was crazy busy, we got our bruschetta and the bread was soggy and not toasted. I asked the waiter what was up and was told that when they get crazy busy they will sometimes skip the step of toasting the bread. Errr...what? Please please dont sacrifice quality for quantity! Thats what causes great places like this to be not so great any more. First the bread, then what? Otherwise, awesome place as of right now.",

    "text": "I was visiting Phoenix, Az and a friend of mine suggested this place to go for dinner. This place isn't exactly cheap, but the food is pretty good. As all the other previous yelpers have yelped about, there is a special $20 deal for a bottle of wine and 4 bruschetta choice topping. The 4 toppings we had was the brie & apple w/ fig spread (our most favorite! Easy to make at home too in case you are low on money but feel like being fancy, lol), smoked salmon w/ pesto (pretty tasty), salami w/ pesto (nothing really worth writing about) & the warm artichoke spread (was actually good, but would probably want to try another option if I ever come back here again).  Well this place also serves soups and sandwiches. The sandwiches are a pretty good big size and are very tasty. The bread they make your sandwiches with are just amazing. I had the turkey sandwich and it was great! My fiance and I also tried some dessert wine (I really love dessert wines only) and we loved the Moscato the best. But $7 for one small glass is not really a good deal. I could easily buy a Moscato bottle of wine for $16 at Bev & Mo that has at least 4 servings of wine. But obviously when you're at the restaurant you pay for the convenience and service. Well as other yelpers have said previously, the service is quiet attentive. My water glass was refilled several times throughout our meal.  Also the bathrooms are pretty large and interesting. The decor inside the restaurant has that posh, homey and relaxed w/ low lighting, type of vibe. Also the parking lot is pretty small and so you will have to drive up to do the valet. We tipped the guy who brought us back our car, as I guess that is probably the norm.  But overall, I thought this place had good food, but the price was a little pricey for me (come on' sandwiches and appetizers with 2 glasses of wine for 2 people costing nearly $50? I am pretty sure I could go somewhere else for the same food but cheaper... yes I know some of you may argue that the food won't be as tasty, but I still think it's a little nuts to be paying so much for 2 people for this low fuss food).",

The complimentary valet is mandatory due to the fact they are in a residential area & there's no parking on the street. Due to the fact that my tom-tom lied to me, I was lost, disoriented & it was dark by the time I got there; I didn't even see the signs, just a full parking lot,,,,,,, 3 hours, a full belly & a parking ticket later, I was on my way home, lol",

For $14, you get to pick 4 different types of bruschetta. The taste is absolutely out of this world (it may sound like i'm exaggerating, but i'm not....truly tasty!) The portion is also generous as well. Trendy decor with a cozy feeling. Love LOVE LOVVEEE this place!!! (I have tried the Gilbert location as well, and it is just as good).",

I spread a little mustard on the goat cheese red pepper one and it was great!! I tried my Sister's sandwich and salad, she had the nine iron and it was one of the best panini's ever!!

    "text": "I've had Postino bookmarked on Yelp for awhile now, but finally decided to give it a whirl -- or maybe swirl is more apropos -- about a month ago. It was the perfect location for a nice dinner with my mom on a Monday night. Apparently, this place is hoping most nights because when we got there it was packed with only valet parking. Now, I'm not opposed to valet parking, but I'm just not comfortable with it. I'm a native of Phoenix strip malls and massive parking structures. It takes some getting used to when I head downtown to tiny parking lots and have to give over my keys to some stranger (okay, that is more the control freak in me).   Anyway, after succumbing to the valet parking necessity, we made our way into a cozy and inviting atmosphere.  We were quickly seated, even though it seemed rather busy (we must have come at the perfect time because after we were seated the place started getting really busy). I had a fantastic view of their wine offerings -- in fact, I was sitting right next to them.  Unfortunately, I didn't partake of anything since I was the designated driver, but I did stare longingly at the rows of beautiful bottles.   I did, however, have a delicious meal. I order the Prosciutto with Brie Panini and the Mediterranean Salad, and I savored every morsel. It was truly fantastic, and I can only imagine how much better it would be with a glass of wine!  This experience has certainly made me begin the countdown until my next visit. And, I'll look forward to sitting on their patio area when the temps cool down.",

Within 5 minutes, even at busy times, you'll usually be asked multiple times for your drink or food order.  I personally think the drink menu needs to be expanded (wine and beer only), but the bruschetta boards and service are so good you'll sacrifice this small misgiving.  Thanks for great service!!",

It was a Monday and they had a wait for what we found out was a poppin special. 20$ for bruschetta and a bottle.  The choices that we were guided to were good but the wine was ho-hum.  Either way it was a good date night not great.  Fast forward a month to the most recent time. We had a blast, we found seats at the bar top and the bartender was engaging and fun and made great suggestions. The food and wine were on point and the vibe was completely different.

Luckily, when you sign up for their newsletter, you receive a coupon for a free bruschetta appetizer. My husband and I immediately drove downtown. First, the parking was pretty bad. I know, its downtown and the parking is bad everywhere! (If only we lived closer, we could bike.) Second, the patio is awesome looking, but so packed we had to sit inside. Luckily, the inside is nice - it's trendy and hip. We sat at the bar inside and pondered over the menu. I saw other folks enjoying wine, so I wanted to be just as cool and ordered a rose. (It was good, but let's face it, I'm more of a cocktail girl.)  Now, when you order bruschetta, you can get up to four different types. We got the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, and Smoked Salmon with Pesto. We also ordered the warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus. With both the dip and the bruschetta with warm artichoke, it was a little too much. Everything was really tasty, but definitely too much of a good thing.   Overall, this is a really good place to get some appetizers and we'll have to come back to try dinner and dessert. Can't wait!",

We had one of the paninis and bruschetta- both were simple, well prepared, with no whistles and bells. They really do a great job of letting the freshness of the ingredients shine. Particularly noteworthy were the bruschettas. Definitely get the burrata one (over the caprese one, they sound similar, but the burrata one is better) and the prosciutto and fig- those were my favorites. Four is plenty to share between three people, and almost too many for two people to share.   We had the creme brulee for dessert. Like everything else, it was low-key, unsurprising food that just really speaks for itself.   Great spot for dinner or a late night. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "My friend from Ohio has me hooked on Postino's. I have tried this location as well as their location in Arcadia. I have truly loved both times that I have gone. I would prefer the Central location only because it was easier to park and I liked the atmosphere/vibe. Be careful not to park in areas that are restricted. The only downside to this location is that it is adjacent to a Circle K. This was our view but we could have also sat the other direction and looked at the bar.   I honestly have not tried any of their main food items. My boyfriend has gotten their Chicken & Mozzarella Panini and it was really good.  I always get their charcuterie boards. This time my boyfriend got the Butcher's Block and I got the Cheese Board. We have no issue at all of making snacks a full meal. We devoured both boards and left happy.",

We sat outside and it is a nice shaded patio with a relaxed vibe. The staff was very insightful and welcoming.  We ordered the bruschetta platter. Oh my we we blown away. They have so many different flavor combinations to choice from. Definitely the best bruschetta I have ever had.  Went during Happy Hour so all glasses of wine were $5. Upward Projects is doing it right. Will be back for sure.",

While the inside tables were full as we were leaving, the outside seating was very much available.  The waitress who served us throughout the night was a sweet lady who called me and even my dad \"honey.\"  The brushetta ($14) was delicious - esp. the brie and apple, bacon & arugula. The tomato, basil & mozzarella was okay, but not stellar.   My parents and I all had the split two ($10). The salads are pretty similar. My mom couldn't really tell them apart.  The prosciutto with brie was great as was the soup of the moment (kale & sausage).   After dinner, we shared a creme brulee ($7) that was not overly sweet - it was just right!   The ambience of the restaurant was amazing - as the sun went down, servers placed candles on each table.  Cons: 1. No reservations (only for 8 ppl and larger)",

FOOD: the bruschettas are so amazing. The various options allow this usual appetizer to take on an entree role. Some with jam, some with meats and some with veggies. There's definitely one you'll love. The salads are so great. Fresh and light. They carry one soup de jour everyday. Don't even ask what it is, just order it. I bet it'll be awesome. Wine list is great with many to choose from. We typically do the 4-bruschetta ($14) set to share and I order the half-half soup salad combo ($10)   SERVICE: so great. They are friendly, welcoming, and sweet. They let you take your time, constantly check up on you, and will even suggest one of their savory wines.   VIBE: it's dim and cool. We were wondering if it was an old post office turned restaurant, hence the name. But that was just a guess. Seating is ample, and booths, tables or bar.  Also enough outdoor seating when the AZ sun is beating down on you.",

I tried the bre and apple fig, smoked salmon and pesto(my fav), sweet and spicy pepper jam and prosciutto and mascarpone fig  I was originally \"talked into the bruschetta by the server figuring I would try it and then order something else and maybe take the rest home. I never made it to something else. I ate the entire tray. Did I say wow yet?",

The bottle of wine is normally a value of $20 +, so this deal is sweet. I enjoyed the Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese the most - I highly recommend it being one of your bruschetta. If you want to go for something new, there is always the seasonal bruschetta (ask your server for details).   We went on a Tuesday night, and arrived around 7pmish. Requested a table for 6. We were fine with sitting either outside or inside. It's a little hot to be outside even with the misting system, so ideally I wanted to have indoor seating. Surprisingly, we only had a 30 minute wait to get a big table inside. Service was fast and efficient. Our waitress did an excellent job. We were 15 minutes early before the special started, but she still granted it to us. She also split the group bill correctly.   The ambiance was perfect. Drinking wine with dim light and candles all around - definitely keeping me in a classy mood. I love the food and service. If you're going for the special, plan to arrive early. The wait can get up to more than one hour in a matter of minutes.",

    "text": "Postino I love you!  I've been coming to Postino's for a few years now, I think it's about time I write a review. This is where my love of wine began to grow. Their wine list is not very long, in fact, it's on a half sheet of paper on a small clip board.. BUT don't let that fool you, their picks are usually quite delicious. Monday's and Tuesday's are holidays on my calendar because it's $20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta night!! This makes me a happy girl!! It's a relaxed atmosphere, music level is just right, all you hear is people enjoying themselves. Service is excellent, waiters/waitresses know what they are talking about, and help each other out even if it's not their table. If you come on a busy night ($20 dollar nights or the weekends) expect a long wait. However, there are plenty of spots to hang out... grab a menu because you can order your bottle of wine and have a glass while you wait for your table.. is that awesome or what? The combination of this being a small place and generally busy on most nights makes it difficult for them to accommodate a large group. Save Postino's for a more intimate place with a date or small group of friends. The food menu is also short, with a mix of a few appetizers, paninis, and salads. The bruschetta board is a whole other topic because it's the most popular thing on the menu... they always have the same list of 10-12 bruschetta to choose from with a seasonal option depending on the time of year. It's not listed on the menu but you have the option of getting the bread \"thin sliced\" which I recommend on $20 nights because I know you will want seconds :) Everyone I have brought to Postino's to experience their magic has loved it. Believe me... You will love it too.",

I generally end up finding empty chairs in the outdoor bar area and pulling them together with a side table to create a makeshift booth of my own! I'm not picky when it comes to things like that, and the price is right at Postino's so it's still one of my favorite date night spots. And the lack of seating only attests to how tasty this place is!   You don't need to be a wine connoisseur to enjoy Postino's either. The staff is good at explaining their flavors without making you feel incompetent for not understanding the difference between shiraz and merlot.",

I was greeted at the front door and mentioned that I was just looking for a spot at the bar, finally deciding on a seat on the exterior portion on the bar.   Their menu is simple but well defined.  I knew I wanted to try the brushetta board.  Thinking I would probably end up taking some home, as you can choose 4 varieties per board order.  On this visit I picked (listed in order of my favorites) the tomato jam with sheep's milk cheese, proscuitto, fig and mascarpone, the burrata with tomato, arugula and bacon, and last but not least the date, pistachio with ricotta.  While all were good, the first 2 definitely  stood out.  Needless to say I finished every piece on my board.   I look forward to trying their salads and sandwiches.",

    "text": "Would it be weird to say that my favorite thing about this place was the restroom..??  It was so much fun with the music all loud and so much space and so many mirrors, I just wanted to wash my hands in there forever and ever...such a happy, unexpected surprise (after a few beers, haha).  Yep, I see now that that really was weird to say...  But alright, starting over...came here for happy hour with a few friends.  Having to park valet was a little off-putting to me, maybe that's just the way it is downtown?  I wouldn't know.  It's just that I rarely have cash on me, so I cringe at having to give a tip or something unexpectedly.  Anyway, other than that, the patio seating was wonderful.  Loved that they had shade over the area so we could enjoy the outdoors without melting or bursting into flames.  Loved the $5 pitcher of beer happy hour special.  I didn't eat, but the bruschetta my friends ordered looked amazing.  How they were able to decide among all the mouth-watering options listed on the menu, I really don't know.  The girls also had a panini sandwich that looked delicious...we snickered a bit that the server said it was too difficult for the kitchen to slice the sandwich into 3 instead of 4 portions, but whatever.  They did accommodate our request to put our next pitcher of beer on ice for a few minutes before we were ready to drink it, so that was nice.    This was my first time at Postino Central, and I will definitely be back.  Perfect place for happy hour with the girls.  Next time I'll make sure to go hungry so I don't miss out on that bruschetta!!",

We were not disappointed, we chose the Central location versus the Arcadia location only because we were on a tight schedule, and it's closer to home. The day we went there it was cold and rainy, inside it was packed, and the outside patio too. They had a waiting time of about 45 minutes, at first we thought, maybe we should come back another day, and were going to go to our usual date-night dinner fare, sushi, at Hana, just down the street... but we persevered, and waited! It paid off, we were called after just 20 minutes of waiting, and were seated at a little table by the wines. The atmosphere was very pleasant, not too loud, although there was a bunch of people at the bar, but I knew they were not there just for the beer, everybody had a bruschetta in front of them!! We ordered some Mimosa and a Bellini, the Cheese Board $14, and the Bruschetta... oh! the Bruschetta! $13.75 for a selection of 4 different types, we ordered the Smoked Salmon Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, and the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone. Everything was delicious!! I wanted to talk my husband into order another round of 4 just to try different ones, but unfortunately, we were too full! The service was excellent, and our visit was really enjoyable. We will be going back there soon!!",

The wine list is hard to beat, but they've also got a great variety of beers on tap. But really... If you're going to Postino, it's for the life-changing bruschetta. Yes, that is every bit as ridiculous as it sounds, but also equally True. Your moth will leave very happy and proud of your for choosing such an excellent restaurant at which to dine. My favorites were always the brie and apples with fig spread, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, warm artichoke spread, and roasted peppers with goat cheese.  If you happen to be coming by Postino at an earlier hour, the brunch menu is equally as delectable. Whether you want the savory Country Toast or sweet Ciabatta French Toast, you really can't go wrong.  Oh, yeah, and the beaded, flannel-wearing bar tenders are pretty easy on the eyes, too.",

On this appetizer you get to select 4 different types of bruschetta so we selected the smoked salmon; the tomato, basil and mozzarella; the apple and brie; and the roasted red pepper.  They were all delicious!  We split the auto strata panini and also had olives.  And, of course, a $5 pitcher of beer, was very nice!    The only thing that I didn't care for was that we were seated in a back corner and right under a speaker so it was difficult to have a conversation.

I wanted to rattle my bobbles in your general direction. But, tonight, you made a lover of me in you. For shame, you bad bad boy.   I met up with three other people tonight for a casual dinner; I brought the light rail because I imbibed in an absinthe gin martini at home while starting a cross word puzzle.   When I arrived, I was greeted by my diner companions and a row of bruschetta. Both were lovely, but the latter were more filling. Since my late arrival, I'm not certain exactly what was ordered: there was one with bacon, one with tomatoes, one with goat cheese, one with prosciutto, among other. I macked them down double time, they were that good. But, I rather filled me up, so I wasn't able to finish my roast beef panini. Oh well, lunch for the following day isn't such a bad thing. All the food was wonderfully delicious.   Postino also has a pleasant wine list and some great beers on tap (I had the Kronenbough 1664).   As for the washrooms, I liked them. The sliding door made me feel butch, like I was tough enough to drag a large piece of frosted glass across the floor. Loved that they stamped their toilet paper with their name and the logos, but wouldn't want to be the first to wipe with that portion.   I understand the neighbors in the Medlock District have issues with the street parking. Hey, I totally understand your concerns. But, having a jewel like Postino in your 'hood makes up for the inconvenience of losing your street parking.   Being a reasonable walk from the light rail, I see this as a place I'll likely frequent.",

These folks really know their wine and bruschetta. What about dessert? You haven't really had an affogato before until you've had a Postino affogato. And the chocolate bouchon? AH-MA-ZING! Have you popped in for brunch lately? I go nuts for the Farm Scramble; they know just how to roast Yukon Gold potatoes and it's always just the right blend of gruyere and white cheddar. Yum! Treat yourself to the triple cream brie and walnut toast; you'll be pleased with the berry preserve that tastes oh-so-truly housemade. The servers here know their wine and treat you with platinum service. Seriously. I feel like I am being waited on hand and foot when I come here. I see my water glass refilled before I can even ask, my wine bottle never stops pouring and they beat me to it whenever I feel like I need a second helping of well..anything. No wonder this is such a spot for first dates - if you want to make a good impression or really just make sure your guests have a good time, this is the place where you'll surely be taken care of.",

    "text": "YUM!  If I lived in Phoenix this would be a place I frequented.  My dining companion was nice enough to share food with me so I could try more things.  First item up was the raspberry chicken salad.  I love Gorgonzola.  I love nuts in salads.  I love raspberry vinaigrettes.  I loved this salad.  The greens were fresh, there wasn't too much chicken, and nothing was too overpowering in the salad.  It was balanced mix and so delightful!  Second item(s) was the bruschetta.  You get a selection of 4 types and it would have definitely been enough for the two of us to share without anything else.  Each selection has about 4 small(ish) slices.  Our first choice was the fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil.  It was good and everything was fresh, but kind of meh compared to the other ones.  The burrata, bacon, argula and tomato was nice. I can't remember which one we decided on for the third (not surprising since I'm writing this review a few weeks later).  And the last was the tomato jam & sheeps milk cheese which was delicious!    I feel like this place probably serves up everything delicious and it would be hard to go wrong with anything you ordered here.  The one thing that sucks is that it is pretty much valet parking only.  It's complimentary but still a hassle.  If you're in the area I definitely suggest you check this place out!",

The atmosphere is really nice. The servers were really attentive and patient with our large party. They had $5 pitchers of beer when we went which is awesome.  I split the: Bruschetta (Traditional, Brie and Apples, Smoked Salmon, Burrata) You pick two: Vegetarian Panini and Mixed Greens salad  The bruschetta: Traditional was so yummy Brie and Apples was a little sweet with the fig jam but, still really good Smoked Salmon, I was worried that it would be too salty but it was good Burrata was my favorite. The cheese was so good. Also, the bread was really good which made all the difference. I really appreciated how they cut each piece into 4 so it was easier to eat.  Panini and Salad Really fresh, very tasty.  I misread the \"you pick two\" and thought it came with a soup. The server was really nice about it and gave us a cup of the roasted cauliflower to try and it was the best soup I've had in a very long time.  I will definitely be coming back here!",

    "text": "I REALLY DON'T KNOW what the hype is all about. I came here with my husband expecting good food, good service, and a clean restaurant. I'm very OCD when it comes to cleanliness of a restaurant. I always inspect my cups, plates, and forks before I ever use it at a restaurant.  STRIKE 1- My husband's water cup had a very visible and distinct LIPSTICK stain on it. The outline of the person's lip was still there! We informed the waiter, he looked embarrassed, and gave us a 'new' cup.  STRIKE 2- The 'new' cup the waiter gave us still had lipstick stains on it... but it was much smaller. We're not sure if he just wiped off the first one, or if many of the cups are this disgusting.  STRIKE 3- My OWN cup had food debris on the inside portion where my lips would have been. I flicked it off with my nail and finger.. and was so disgusted. Both of us didn't drink a sip of water the whole time there.  STRIKE 4- My plate had visible and distinct food debris on it. I wiped it off with the napkin... my husband gave me his plate to use. I had enough of this 'yucky-ness', so when my food came, I literally ate over my napkin.  Now for the food, we ordered the Bruschetta and Nine Iron Panini. You get to choose 4 flavors for the Bruschetta. We tried Smoked Salmon with Pesto.... Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato... Salami with Pesto... and something else I don't remember. Visibly appealing. Too bad it doesn't taste as good as it looks. I'm not saying its nasty, it is just not 'all that.' The bread wasn't as crunchy as I thought it should be. The bread was more... chewy than anything else. My favorite out of the 4 we got was the Bacon one.  The Nine Iron Panini was just okay. Thick bread, nice portion, but nothing I would get again.  CONCLUSION- If they were more clean, I would maybe give them a 3 out of 5 tops. But seriously, who wants to eat that dirty? WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.",

    "text": "I just don't know. I liked the valet service. I don't like not knowing where to stand and wait for the hostess to seat you because you come through a back patio door and assume it's not the front. There aren't many tables inside, and they are all close together because the huge bar table takes up a ton of room. The patio outside did look cute though.   Always wanted to try the bruschetta here so I got the prosciutto fig & honey, the classic mozzarella basil tomato, a salmon caper something, and my waiter suggested the roasted red pepper as my fourth choice.   You get a ton of food, each slice is cut up into four pieces and quantity wise it is worth the price. But taste and flavor, not so much. The fig and prosciutto was different and almost desert like with the sweetness, but the rest of the three were lackluster. The salmon and caper was blanddddd like barely any salmon flavor at all. The red pepper was the opposite, way too much flavor. Roasted red pepper is a huge taste bud explosion but you have to balance that, the chef did not know how to do this as it was a huge pile of pepper and you could barely taste anything else. Last sadly was the \"classic\" mozzarella tomato basil. So sad. I guess I am spoiled by my Mother's perfect fresh basil and tomatoes with her balsamic glaze back home. They had no balsamic on the dish and I had to request a bottle, it still didn't add up.   Service was great though. Maybe I would come back and try some of the other flavors. Hopefully those are worth the price because my choices didn't seem like it!",

    "text": "OMG! Postino's went above and beyond for me on my birthday and I cannot even begin to thank them enough.   See they do not take reservations on Sunday's because it gets crazy busy with their brunch and it is just a very popular day. Plus rain was in the forecast for Sunday which was going to make space even tighter. However I called up Postino's on Saturday and spoke with Troy # 1 and told him that I was coming on Sunday with about 20+ people and asked if there was anyway he could help me out. Hmm he says, let me get your number and I will call you back when I can figure out something. So about an hour later he calls to let me know that he can't reserve a table for 20 but that he can can hold at 4 top for me and as my party comes, we can seat them as needed and as long as their is not a wait. Deal!!!!   So Sunday arrives, I go to Postino's and Troy # 2 lets me know that Troy#1 told him about me and my situation and that he was there to take care of me. :) YAY! so we were seated at our 4 top, and soon after, we were able to take over another table, then another, until we took over the entire back booth area as well as one 4 top that was close by. There was a couple, Sandy and Mike, that was sitting in the back booth who were so very sweet. We pretty much took over their area to the point that by the time they got ready to leave, they had gone from sitting in the middle of the booth to the very end of the booth. My friend Deb bought them each a glass of wine because they were so very generous and just all around great people.   Now everyone told me how fabulous their bruschetta was and they were right. I only had a few pieces because I wanted to I talked to everyone and make sure that they were having a good time. But I will be back to enjoy an entire board by myself. Ok maybe not by myself but still, it was damn good. The wine I was drinking was also excellent as well. Hats off to my friend Deb for picking a fabulous red for me. You are the best.   Special thanks also goes out to our server TJ who rocked it for us all afternoon. He made sure everyone was taken care of when it came to food, drinks, etc. Thank you TJ!!!   I truly enjoyed myself and I will be back again VERY soon. Thank you again to the entire staff at Postino's on Central for making my 35th birthday extra special.",

For any first timer you should try any of the Boards, but they are known for the Bruschetta board, you will not be disappointed (unless you don't like bruschetta).  Share a sandwich or salad, and make sure to ask what the soup of the day is, always worth a try.  Finish it off with the Salted Caramel Sundae, not a sweets fan but the saltiness is perfect.   Your building is beautiful and well thought out and I love the old school skate stickers that I spot randomly.

    "text": "For my 300th review, I wanted to write about somewhere that I have been yearning to try for a long time.  This was my first visit to Postino and it definitely lived up to the hype.  Ever since I moved to Phoenix, I have observed that every time I am hanging out at a wine bar with friends, this place inevitably creeps into the conversation.  \"Oh, look, they have a comfy couch like at Postino's\".... \"This bruschetta is not as good as Postino's\"....\"Cool, their happy hour glass price is only $5 like Postino's\". So, I have felt a need to visit for a while but just never been able to make it happen.  I live in Chandler and work in Scottsdale so I don't really visit downtown/uptown Phoenix often.  And when I pulled into the parking lot I remembered why.  No place to park except in a tow away zone so my friend and I had to drive a ways down the street.  Say what you want about the suburbs but sometimes it is just nice to drive up, park, walk in and be immediately seated without a hassle.  Once we had settled in to our comfy seats, however, our cares melted away.  Our server was super nice and friendly (as everyone there seems to be). Even though we took advantage of the awesome $5 glass special, we both wanted to try each others selections so she brought us extra glasses.  We noshed on a fantastic bowl of olives while enjoying our wine and deciding what to order. Of course I knew going in that I needed to order the bruschetta board but my plan had been to get it for an app and then order something else.  My friend suggested getting that as a meal to share which actually worked perfectly since the portions are surprisingly large.  You get to pick four different selections (very hard to do since they all sound awesome) and then each one is so big they cut it into three bite size pieces.  We did finish with a cappuccino and split a dessert, mostly because we just didn't want to leave, yet couldn't keep ordering wine since we had to drive afterwards. So, there you have it, the perfect meal!  Top it off with a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum down the street afterwards and you are in perfect day territory.  I hope to visit Postino again with the hubby some time in the future.  I had been envisioning someplace a little more girly and a lot more pretentious, but it really is very homey and laid back so I know he would love it, too. There was a real diverse crowd when we were there.  Plus, they have a decent beer selection in addition to the fab wine list so that will help get him in the door. Now if only it was more conveniently located.  Well, I hear that they are opening one up in Gilbert soon so we just may have to become regulars there!",

It's not unreasonable to have to wait an hour to be seated and then another 20-30 minutes to get your order in.  If you have a large party, even longer.  Worst of all, they do not take reservations, so you cannot avoid the 2+ hour affair of going to Postino.  I'm surprised so many can go on a weekday and take such a long day.  It is a great place to eat at, I just wish it wasn't so popular and at the very least took reservations or call ahead seating to make a more pleasurable experience.",

The appetizers are worth the trip. The boards are great, really nice nuts, pretzels,cheese,  meats. And everyone loves their bruschetti, which is a meal. I al also an autostrada fan, kinda like an Italian sub grilled down to nothing.  I wish they had domestic beer, their lightest beer is rather heavy. They only have a few beers on tap and they aren't for the wimpy. The walls are lined with wines, if that's your fancy. The single best thing is probably their walknut chicken salad. And you can do a 1/2 and 1/2 for just a smalllll price. (salad/sammy/soup). I will say that me and my cohorts got pretty ill here once when we were cheese tasting. Then I thought about how long it takes to get goat cheese here from France and all the things that could go wrong along the way. Weigh that risk yourself before you take a walk down the exotic cheese path they offer there. Overall, nice upscale crowd, great outdoor seating,  super food and friendly staff as well.",

At first I was skeptical about the limited menu and how good bruschetta can be - i mean its bread with some cheese and toppings. Well they Postino proved me wrong. The variety of the Bruschetta was fantastic! My favorite was the smoked salmon with pesto - it had these delicious capers in there! So Tasty!  The atmosphere was great! We had outdoor seating and it was very comfortable.   Highly Recommend!",

Anything on the menu is excellent and the servers are really cool and helpful with suggestions.   Only drawback is that the parking sucks, pay the \"free\" valet or get a 16 dollar ticket.

Came here with my man-friend the other day for lunch, and my only complaint is that they don't serve the brunch menu on the weekdays... Something to look forward to on the weekends though, because it is goddamn delicious. Not only is this place great for breakfast, lunch, dinner or HH.. its also got a decent selection of wines for sale, AND wine on tap.. are you kidding me? Love it.  To accompany our Mimosas, because it was a champagne kind of day, we shared the prosciutto & brie panini along with their famous bruschetta  - you get to choose 4 kinds per order so we did the brie & apple with cheese spread, prosciutto with figs & marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto and the roasted pepper with goat cheese.. ahhhmazinzazing! All of them. F-ing mouthwateringly delicious. Certainly try a few if you happen to visit.   Their drink deals are ridiculous.. $5 glasses of wine or $5 pitchers of beer from 11-5pm, Monday and Tuesday its $20 for a bottle of wine and plate of bruschetta , and you get $9 off any bottle if you take it to go. They have a a groovy back patio that is wonderful for anytime of year since they bust out the heat lamps, 1 per table it seemed, plenty of parking and pristine bathrooms. I like the minimalistic decor.. and the fact that it was very light and airy.. literally the place was packed about 15 minutes after we sat down, and I never felt claustrophobic like I do so very often.   Everything about this place makes me smile. Its just GOOD. Go here as soon as you can, I promise you wont regret it.",

Ricotta with dates & pistachios 2. Salami with pesto 3. Brie & apple with fig spread 4. Almond hummus with tomato   It's ALWAYS sooo good and fresh, full of flavor and it felt healthy eating here.   For wine I always got a bottle of moscato...it's just so good! I love Tuesday's for that reason haha.   If you order a bottle of wine and can't finish it for some reason, you can take it home which is very nice!   Their take out service is very fast and convenient.  The atmosphere is very hipster, young and trendy.   Do be warned though, I feel like if your looking to come here for a full course dinner, this isn't where you'd go for that....so don't come here starving wanting to get full off of food you pair with wine.   The staff are usually nice, it's a good time here.",

Any mix or match of them will be sure to keep any group happy. They have such great options. My very favorite is the salmon pesto. They do slice them into I think 4's it was so each one can be shared so everyone can enjoy all the different flavors. Such a wonderful concept.   The only reason I snagged a star from this review is because on the patio there seemed to be a lot of flies. We pushed them away but it just feels kind of icky while eating to have so many out and about. Hard to control on a patio space I know but I don't find this an issue at other locations. Just a small something I noticed that really did change the feel of the experience at the location.",

It is more compact than some other locations in some respects. We took a spot at the bar and were greeted by Vanessa, friendly and just an outstanding bartender. She never stopped: kept tabs on us as she hustled around the bar, mixing drinks, cleaning up and multitasking like a ninja. Fun to watch.   We only ordered a bottle of sparkling rose as we'd just eaten at another place, but the food here is always good and well-made. Another win for Postino in my opinion and it'll be added to my roster of regular stops.",

I've been to three different location and I've never had an issue with the service. There's always a friendly, warm, welcoming ambiance at Postino.   I've heard great things about their brunch and would love to pop in one of these days to explore more of their menu. If you're out of town or maybe it's your first time here, then I would go with their bruschetta because I feel like that's what they're really known for.",

We got there a little before 8 pm (when the deal starts), so our waitress was very friendly and offered to get some appetizers started in the meantime. We had the meatballs with goat cheese, which I surprisingly enjoyed. I am not a fan of goat cheese, but the flavor wasn't too overpowering on these. Once 8 rolled around, she came back and took our orders. Our food was promptly delivered, all the while she kept coming back to check on us to make sure we were doing well and refilling our water. Bruschetta was delicious as usual, wine was flowing and great company. What more can you ask for?!",

    "text": "Postino: A haiku  Bruschetta divine Butcher's board: plentiful food Noisy when busy  Seriously, go here for the bruschetta. I spent a lovely afternoon with the always awesome Kelley U. enjoying some shared \"bites on boards\". We ordered one board of bruschetta ($15) but in hindsight I would have liked to get another order of bruschetta to try out all the varieties instead of getting the butcher's block ($15.50). Everything about the bruschetta was near perfection. The bread was lightly toasted and strong enough to hold all the ingredients on top yet soft enough that it wouldn't be tough to eat. The ingredients on top were all fresh, well balanced, and a generous portion. Our selections were the warm artichoke, burrata bacon and arugula, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and pepper jelly with goat cheese.   The butcher's block was also good, but I didn't like the toasted bread as much since some pieces were very hard while others were a little too chewy for my tastes. The ingredients for the board though were plentiful and a beautiful sight to behold though. Some of the foods included on the board were goat cheese, hummus, olives, roasted tomatoes, dried cherries, nuts, and asparagus spears.   Service was friendly and polite. There was a slight miscommunication with our order (Our server didn't hear us when we requested the butcher board while ordering) but once it got cleared up our missing food came out in a matter of minutes.  We got here right when it opened and it was easy to talk and dine. As lunchtime progressed though it got harder to hear each other as it got progressively more noisy in the dining area as more people got seated.   The one reason why I decided to dine at Postino Central over the Arcadia location was that it was easier to find a parking spot. There are a small number of spots in front of the building but if you go around the corner to the back there are more spaces to choose from. It's not a huge lot but I had no problems finding a spot and when we left at noon on a weekday, despite being busy there were still a few spots left in the lot.  I'll definitely be back for more of that bruschetta!",

We split a bottle of wine, had the cheese board and soups, all of which were excellent and well presented.   Parking was kind of limited with lots of signs saying don't park here.   At checkout, I find out that the gift card was never loaded with funds.  It was kind of frustrating, I'm not going to bother the gift giver with a request for the receipt.  As my frustration started to build, the manager Kara did a fantastic job managing my frustration.  I understand they can't do much at the restaurant and was directed to call the corporate office to get it sorted out.  She took money off the check even after I said to not worry and ring me out so she did her best.",

My favorite was the mascarpone with figs! SO GOOD. Then ordered a salad and fiance had some type of sandwich with a salad on then side. I prefer his salad over mines . Food was just okay, nothing special. Especially there menu is very small.   I gave it a 3 because it took awhile to get refills or even more wine .

I usually get the half sandwich and soup for lunch, but my favorite occasion to visit is for the bruschetta and a bottle of wine night on Monday's and Tuesdays. It is amazing!

The bruschetta board saves this place.  They are excellent, myself being partial to the tomato and basil, burrata and bacon and arugula, and the white bean with tomato.  I've also had the pub board, which is great to nosh on with a beer (Spanish corn nuts too!)  The grilled cheese is solid, nice thick, chewy bread, good amount of quality cheese.  And the butcher's block, another noshing board that I can't complain about.  If you are looking for truly excellent wines, this is not the place.  The wines here are a great value.  They are good enough for the price when everything is $5, or $20 for a whole bottle and a bruschetta (on Mondays and Tuesdays.)  But they are not deep, complex, mouth-filling, blow-your-mind wines.  I come for the beer.  And the ambiance, which is awesome.  There is nothing better than sitting outside here with a pitcher of beer and picking at one of the boards.  The energy here is great and the staff has always been friendly.  Oh.  The salted caramel Sunday.  Again, it's got corn nuts.  Awesome.  Sign up for their email list and you get a free dessert (get this one) on your birthday.",

    "text": "I believe this is my first Yelp review ever. So you know this place is either really good or...  My party ended up waiting an hour and a half for a table that was five feet from where we were standing. Our table was given away thirty minutes into our wait because they \"couldn't get a hold of us.\" Even though we never moved and they seem to find us fine when they wanted to sell us more wine.  I know, \"Why wait so long?\"   Trust me, it wasn't my decision to stay and wait. So I had to give this place a chance.  I've worked in restaurants for most of my life. I know that \"Your table is being set up\" means \"I think one of our tables is about to ask for the check.\" Personally though I would never use that lie when that party can reach over and touch the table in question.   After sitting down and looking at the menu I realized that I had come to a bar expecting a restaurant. Which should be my fault but I've never had to wait over an hour to get into a bar so you can see where I became confused.  With over-priced food like \"bruschetta\" breadsticks, bland cauliflower soup, Starbucks style panini's, and a brussels sprout salad that lacked actual brussels, I should have understood that people come here to drink and feel fancy.   The wine was good (probably because it was made by somebody else). The food, however, was lacking in flavor. Which could be a reason why the staff pushes the booze so much. But based on the taste of the food alone, I could imagine the assembly line of out of the can produce they scoop onto some kind of toasted bread to sell their inebriated customers.    It wasn't just a few bad qualities here and there, it was a good number of them that just kept stacking up. In my experience, if I ever made a party wait that long for a table I would, at the very least, have the manager come by to apologize for the mishap.   It's easy to come off as not caring when that's not the intent. I get it. What's hard is always killing it with customer service every time so that not one customer falls between the cracks. With the kind of hype that accompanies this place, I expected that kind of experience. I'm really disappointed that wasn't the case.   It was only my mother's birthday dinner but I guess if I expect great food with great customer service I should cook food at home. At least then if my guest have to wait long for their food, I can distract them with free booze or something. Hopefully, Postino learns to do the same.  I would recommend this place to: The Pumpkin Spice Girls of the world.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere and great food. We asked for a seat on the patio and it was a perfect day for lunch outside. The servers were so very nice and greeted us quite quick. They gave each of us water and then took our drink orders. Also, any day before 5:00pm all glasses of wine and pitchers of beer are $5-yes I said it $5. So naturally I ordered a glass of red, because $5. My friend was recovering from being sick, so she got the cucumber honey lemonade. I had a sip before she did and it was very refreshing and light, I highly recommend it! My wine came out, but I noticed the bottle had been corked. I politely informed the waiter and he was more that ready to take it away and replaced it with a fresh uncorked glass. I ordered the Bruschetta board, apple and fig, spicy jam and goat cheese, bacon and arugula, and a seasonal. I also ordered a side of their roasted brussel sprouts, the way they make it tastes like nature's butter-so delicious!! My friend ordered the Autostrada panini on ciabatta bread with a side salad. Both of our meals came out quickly and did not disappoint. We had left overs and when the bill came it was roughly $20 person with tip. Will be returning in the future!",

This is a perfect hangout place with your friends, a very good date place or a place you could just go for some low key relaxation. And when you are there you have to try the bruchetta. My personal favorites are the smoked salmon and the artichoke but they have a decent variety so mix and match. Last but not the least, it's a wine place so definitely have your glass. This is by far my favorite wine bar in Phoenix. Do visit.",

The environment has a soft ambiance with a more upbeat feel. Diners can choose their own wine from the wine racks or order by the glass. You haven't experienced Postino's until you indulge in their selection of pick and choose bruschettas brought out on a wooden slab. My favorites are the brie & apples with fig spread, the fresh mozzarella with tomato & basil, prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and the warm artichoke spread bruschetta. The panini and soups are also wonderful and they have just started serving brunch on the weekends until 1pm.   Don't miss out on their Monday and Tuesday nights special! For $20.00 it includes one bottle of house wine and a slab of bruschetta.   I would highly recommend this place for a date night, night out with the girls or gathering. Definitely one of my favorite spots in town to sip on wine and take in the scenery while enjoying a mimosa on the patio.",

    "text": "Hmmmmm, interesting...  Evolution and growth?  It seems apropos that I was to meet up with fellow Yelpers Lauren V. and Mr. K (aka Omar K.) for a couple drinks on a late Friday afternoon.  This was my first trip back to PHX in roughly three years and was doing a bizarre \"visit old friends/places and see new friends/places\" kind of trip.  So, with that in mind, Lauren V. and I had been discussing various HH spots and places we liked which the original Postino's was mentioned as a place we both love.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue with revisiting the past or do something new...so after much hemming and hawing on my part she made an executive decision to meet up at the new location.  Her choice was perfect in so many ways.  Shortly before HH, I looked at the map provided in the B'berry Yelp App and asked my friend Lindra F. If this was near Katz Deli....a sad look was returned and it was explained this IS where Katz Deli was...maaaan, really?  An old Phoenix institution gone?  For a wine bar?  Shit...I was bummed and had a chip on my shoulder coming in...which by the end of the night...dissolved.  The remodeled space is a throw back to the Palm Spring-ish modernism of chunky stone and floor to ceiling large pane windows.  Flat lines and clean angles characterize the place but there are enough accents to make the whole place feel seriously intimate.  Basically, the feel is ultra-cool lounge of the late-50's and early 60's.  I like this.  I don't like this everywhere...but I like this here.  It's something of an homage to older Phoenix, and to me, the idea that it replaced Katz (which was born in that era) shows a huge sign of respect and knowledge of the underlying culture of an area.  The quality of the space is top notch as is their understanding of sense of place.  Lastly, on the topic of design, the outside patio and the bar servicing it offer great Western views for sunsets.  However, those inside are not robbed of any views either.   The layout offers those with both the same view the patio has (over the bar) and stunning Eastern views as well (saw a great lightning storm on my visit).  The wines-well...fantastic of course.  Living now in San Francisco I can say that Postino's can enter into any upper echelon of San Francisco wine bars.  The servers know their stuff and the beers are great too....Anchor Steam Celebration Ale on tap every Winter makes me ridiculously happy and impressed.  The grub...just like the original..fantastic.  You can rarely go wrong with anything on the menu.  Postino's offers the prime place to have some quality wine and grub while chatting it up with new or old friends.  If I lived nearby I'd be here at least once a week.  ...which leads me to the dissolving of that aforementioned chip on my shoulder.  I was getting tired of the pervasive thought in the Valley of just demolishing the past and throwing something new in its place for the sake of something new.  I was very worried about that here...especially in almost hallowed ground of Katz Deli.  However, what I came to find is a well planned slow growth of a high quality establishment who designed the space as an homage to the past but showed a enticing view of some of Phoenix's future.  Thanks to Lauren V. for the rec...you were spot on.",

I am a frequent lounger at the Postino on Campbell and I figured this location would be just as great when I decided to meet a group of  girlfriends here for drinks a few weeks ago.  We sat down at a lovely little couch/chair area and waited for our server.  We waited...and waited...and waited some more.  It took forever for them to realize we were sitting there, greet us and take our drink order.  Once I got my wine and was a little more pacified we decided to tackle the topic of what bruschetta would we be ordering this visit.  Well, we had plenty of time to decide and debate because we waited forever for our server to come back.  I would understand this much better if they were busy, but they weren't.    I am a big fan of Postino, so I will chalk this up to a fluke.  But, next time I hope that I don't have to wait an eternity for my glass of wine and wonderfully delicious bruschetta...it's rather cruel to leave me hanging when I know what awaits my taste buds.",

    "text": "If you are ever looking for a place to reunite with long lost family members, I highly recommend Postino.   I went there on a suggestion by my Bestie, Dottsy Z. after I received a phone call from my uncle (whom I had never met in my life) wanting to meet for brunch on Sunday. I was looking for a central location between Mesa and Avondale and Dottsy being the Social Diva Extraordinaire knew the spot!   It was the perfect day for sitting on the patio. The trees provided enough shade to prevent me from improving upon my already awesome farmers tan I received the day before at the Good Guys Auto Show. There was a trio playing a good mix of soft music although I would have toned down the volume a bit. All in all it was the perfect setting for my first meeting with my uncle, his wife and my cousin.   The menu is perfect for light Italian dining. The majority of us ordered panini's. I had the prosciutto and brie on ciabatta with salad. It was AH-MAZING. Being the Italian gal I am I love me some prosciutto, and added with the brie and fig...YUM! My cousin had the same and he devoured his before I had even three bites in to mine. It may be the fact that he is on spring break from the Naval Academy that he has the constant appetite of a teenage boy. My aunt had the bruschetta which she loved but couldn't finish, my cousin took care of that problem. My husband had the tuna panini and like my cousin took his down in seconds flat.  The only down side to the menu was the lack of kid friendly options. We had our 18 month old son with us and there wasn't a thing on the menu he would touch. Luckily our server was kind enough to bring a bowl out of their organic chips for him to munch on, and happily he did. So unless your little one can maintain on chips alone or has an advanced palate, I would refrain from taking them along.   There are so many other things on the menu that I want to try. I cannot wait for my next visit!",

I cheated heavy on my vegetarian diet with the i-n-c-r-e-d-i-b-l-e \"B.E.L.T\", a panini-style sandwich bursting forth with eggs, thick slices of tomato, fresh spring mix, and perfectly cooked, amazingly flavorful bacon. The berry french toast, sprinkled with almonds and drizzled with some vanilla-y goo, also lived up to our lofty expectations. The apricot scone, which was thoughtfully served warm with a side of perfectly softened butter and apricot preserves, was very tasty, but not quite perfection. As a self-admitted snotty scone connoisseur, the texture was not quite up to snuff although the flavor was quite nice. The mimosas were delish, although really, how does one really fuck up a mimosa?  An extra half star for our brunch server, who either eavesdrops like a mofo or reads lips on the side, as he managed to congratulate my still-dizzy SO on his graduation from his MBA program (which had occurred approximately two hours prior!). Or did the shirt and tie on a Saturday morning give it away? Either way, my SO was dumbfounded and flattered at once. Nice touch!",

    "text": "High on Attitude...Low on Service..  By this point, I would have imagined Postino would running better then a Patek Philippe watch....That was not the case last night.    My suggestion... Give Postino Central time to hire a service focused staff with a sense of urgency before you come here.   The arrival of Postino in my 'hood was highly anticipated.  I was hoping the new \"central\" location would be \"inspired\" by Postino... not an Exact replica.. Which was a little boring!  We arrived at 7:30 to a full bar.. Which, a full bar is nothing new for this restaurant group, so why did it seem so chaotic?   We found some seats at the bar and waited to be served... and waited... and waited... we counted 3-4 on bar staff... yet the \"main'\" bartender seemed pre-occupied, and easily distracted.. AHAD?  We were finally acknowledged after 10 mins and placed our orders.    As we looked around, we noticed others at the bar with either an empty drink or no drink at all. (Amazing that the owner was monitoring the restaurant, however did not pick up on the fact so many at the bar had to wait so long for service)   There was one lucky group at the bar, ( We think they were the original cast from  the movie Sixteen Candles  ) that enjoyed exceptional service and attention.. Full drinks at all times, maintaining the bartender's attention as the rest of the patrons suffered.  Perhaps they hypnotized or used voodoo on the staff... Hey ...whatever it takes... I guess I'll go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight before my next visit!   The bruschetta we ordered was great, the same quality as the Campbell location.  Warm, thickly sliced artisan bread, covered with generous amounts of toppings.  Our favorites were the prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone cheese and the Apple & Brie.. yummy!!!  The food was the only reason I gave this night a 2 star.    Although we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed  our food... we stayed.  Big mistake!  We foolishly thought  once Jake Ryan and Caroline Mulford left the bar , the voodoo spell would be broken, that was not the case...the wait for the following drinks were just as lengthy as the first!  If I were the owner, .. I'd replace the Bar Staff with the Valet Staff.. The Valet Staff was quicker, service focused  and had more personality then anyone at the bar..  I look forward to returning back to Postino Central when they have \"ironed out\" the \"kinks\"..",

It has been lots of fun watching the change from Katz to Postino.  Finally, on Monday, we drove by and saw it open.  We immediately turned around, and then around and around again trying to find parking.  We gave up and decided to plan on it two days later.  Well, two days later arrived and we found a place to park across the street and next to the gas station.   Everything else is worth 5 stars.  The service here was impeccable.  Our server was both friendly and knowledgeable.  Every server in the restaurant was attentive, I had seen a few different ones stop by our table to clear our plates or refill our water.  It was really nice to see servers that operated like a family.  The food was out of this world.  Usually, I don't get salads, but the raspberry chicken salad sounded too good to pass up, and it was wonderful.  It was very appropriate in size, and quite filling.  The raspberry dressing went so well with the gorgonzola and apples.  The lettuce was fresh and tasty.  The bread they served with it was also quite good.  I'm going to guess it was some kind of blueberry walnut bread.  We also got a grilled cheese to share.  I love grilled cheese, and this one was fantastic.  They served it with three dipping sauces, mustard, ketchup, and pesto.  All three of them were excellent with the sandwich.  Their wine list seems to be pretty well rounded but I don't know anything about wine.  I love that Postino is on the way home from work.  The relaxed vibe of this place makes me really comfortable in here whether I am dressed up from work or wearing jeans and a t-shirt on a weekend.  Phenomenal place.",

    "text": "YES! This place is phenomenal -- hip, trendy and just fun! Went here recently for a girls' night on Tuesday to take advantage of their screamin' deal: $20 for a whole bottle of wine and 4 (4!) bruschettas. I'd never had wine here before, so honestly I was expecting the wine to be sub-par, especially for such a great deal. I could not have been more wrong! Our server (forget her name, but she had short blonde hair) was excellent for the following reasons: had the firepits turned on for us since it was a tad windy/cold out that night, patient when a few of us took a few extra seconds making up our minds about what to order, and last but not least: recommended a wine that matched my EXACT taste/description. Being from Northern CA I've gone to Napa/Sonoma/Healdsburg, etc tons of times and while I'm not a huge wine connoisseur, you sort of figure out over time what good wine is and what isn't. The wine here was great and high quality!! The bruschetta was also plated nicely, served on a wooden board in decent portions...and were SO tasty! The atmosphere was super-cool -- any place that's packed you know is going to be great and this place was no exception! When a place is as good as this, everyone there is in a great mood so it makes for a cool opportunity to chat it up with your fellow patrons. Even the bathrooms there are awesome! Candle-lit and hip. Parking is super-easy with the free valet! I love giving credit where it's due: great job POSTINO!! You guys got it right. :D",

Either way, it seems like a great place to take a first date or to scope for one because it's always full middle-class people eating toast. I think they're bored.

When I got the email that they were starting to serve brunch I had to try it out. (Not to mention it was the perfect day to sit on a patio and drink mimosas). I tried the fritatta, which more closely resembled a Spanish tortilla, and it was good. (Not as good as the tortilla Espanola at Sol y Sombra....sniff, sniff). My husband had the country toast, which was kind of like an open face Monte Cristo, except minus the French toast part. A classy Moons Over My Hammy , if you will. It was also good, although I wish that there was an egg on each piece of bread. The other brunch offerings include French toast, BELT (Bacon, eggs, lettuce, tomato), a salmon dish (not quite a bagel and lox) as well as other egg dishes. They offer a few sides and starters- the walnut toast was fantastic. Walnut bread with brie and preserves? Yes please. In addition they also offer a huge pot of French press coffee, which my husband really liked. (It is Lola coffee).   They have also recently expanded the patio, which I didn't notice on my last visit a few weeks ago since I was seated inside. It now has more seating space and a nice fireplace. (Which was going when we were there for brunch, a nice touch but completely unnecessary, it was quite warm).   I am confident that Postino's brunch will make its way into our regular brunch rotation.",

I ordered the green salad with chicken, candied pecans, blue cheese, grapes and pears. Delish! It was fairly busy when I went and at times the service was slow. The bartender was very busy but apologetic for not getting my second mimosa out very quickly.

I went on a Tuesday evening around 7, and the place was packed. However, my friends and I were able to enjoy a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board at the bar while we waited for a table. An hour later (we had a large group of 6+), we were seated on the patio next to the fireplace, and we had a blast munching on the meat and cheese board, another bruschetta board - the apple+fig jam+brie is amazing, and more wine. They had a fantastic Argentinian Malbec. To our delight, there was a bottle + board special going on that night after 8pm ($20 for both), so we left at closing with full tummies, still moderately full wallets, and happy hearts. Many thanks to the bartenders who were great too! I'll be back!",

Every Monday and Tuesday Postino will offer a special on their wine and bruschetta, starting at 8pm.  Make sure to get there early so you can put your name down on the list.  For only $20 you can get a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta.  The board comes with four bruschetta and they are huge.  The service was amazing but parking can be an issue.  They have valet service so that does help with parking, and they only ask for a tip.  The servers will let you taste the wine before you jump into purchasing a whole bottle and they always have suggestions.  When I went the second time, the hostess forgot to come and seat us at a table.  We let the hostess know and without hesitation, she apologized and sat us immediately.  Not only did the hostess apologize but the servers and the manager also expressed how sorry they were.  We told them that we understood because it is a busy night (which is a good thing) and they have this special going on.  This place gets five stars all around for great service, ambiance, price and food.",

    "text": "Postino is a fantastic wine bar with a nice ambiance. The wines are priced $8-12/glass, but happy hour glasses of wine are only $5 every day! During peak hours it is loud with music and lots of conversation. So do not expect a quiet romantic setting. But it's a lively atmosphere.   The wine selection is fairly large (maybe 25-30?) and they usually have other wines that are not on the menu. I had a moscato that was not on the menu and it was one of the best I'd ever had. Sweet and bubbly, which is what I was in the mood for. As for food, it is inexpensive considering the quality of the place and area. Paninis are under $10 and come with a small romaine salad. Or you have order the Pick 2 with half panini and a small salad/soup of your choice. I highly recommend the prosciutto and brie panini. The strawberry chicken is very good.   Postino is quite famous for its bruschetta though. It is pricier than other menu items but is pretty big and can be paired with a good wine and shared with someone. My favorite is the brie, fig jam and apple.   They have complimentary valet, which you really need during their busy friday and saturday nights or the weeknight where the bottles of wine are very cheap (I forget what night that is, but it's suuuuper cheap).  Come to Postino and you'll want to come back again. And again. It means \"mailman\" by the way. Maybe you'll want to become a mailman. And then maybe you'll want to come in to make the argument that since you are a mailman you should get a little discount or a free glass a wine. Try it and let us know if it works.",

Like everyone else, I love the bruschetta, but I tend to come for brunch more often now. The french toast is probably my favorite menu item. I admit that I might indulge in a glass of wine before the clock strikes noon. Usually, it's a Mimosa for me, though.

    "text": "Brunch here is underwhelming, but for dinner/drinks it's a great spot. If the wine list ($5 a glass before 5pm) and bruschetta aren't enough, their salads and paninis are amazing. This is a very ~hip~ place located in central phoenix surrounded by a handful of other hip eateries and some empty lots. It's not super spacious inside, but there is a patio and a corner booth I like to take over when I come here with my bb. To my delight, they have plastic highchairs and a counter space in one of the bathrooms you could uncomfortably change a diaper- not exactly family friendly. But honestly, my best experiences at Postinos have been sans baby, when I can relax and leisurely sip wine & eat olives as if I have no responsibilities other than selecting which bruschetta I want.  Parking is annoying. If you have cash for a tip, take advantage of the valet.",

At $5 for a bellini, mimosa, or any wine that is served by the glass (regularly $9-12) the happy hour is a great deal! We ordered olives for the table and each got a panini & salad combo. The flavors and ingredients were stellar. Everyone was satisfied and thought their particular panini/salad was the best! There is a nice outdoor seating area as well as the dining room & bar inside. You can also purchase wine by the bottle. I highly recommend this place and wish they had a location in LA.  Carry on, Postino Central. You're doing everything right!",

At first, we went over to the Arcadia location (closer to where I live), but it seemed much snootier than the Central location, so we drove an extra couple of minutes to get there.   Again, the food was spectacular. This time, though, we had an amazing waitress who made the whole experience an absolute blast.

While they don't necessarily have the most amazing selection of wine, they do have a good selection and I had some pretty good glasses (from Spain and Argentina) while I was there.  They don't really have a dinner menu, but they did have some good appetizers.  They have some great hearty selections of bruschetta that are really unique, such as Proscuitto with Figs and Marscarpone and Brie and Apples with Fig Spread.  When it comes down to it, you're really coming here for the atmosphere and not for the food.  I'd definitely recommend this spot if you're looking to socialize in a cool, sleek environment rather than a typical dive bar.    My only complaint was really the bathroom - they have one bathroom with one stall for men (I heard women have two stalls?).  With the amount of people who can be there, there's a possibility of long waits when it comes to using the bathroom.  It doesn't really make any sense: a place serving alcohol should have at least a few stalls so that people don't have to wait in long lines.",

I like this location best between this one and the Arcadia location (splitting hairs here) because of the patio, on a cool day outside it's heaven.

There are multiple types but for me I have to make sure I order the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, the Brie and Apples with Fig Spread, and the Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheeps Milk.  I've had all of them though and you really can't go wrong.  If you live in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Mesa/Tempe and haven't been to a Postino you're ridiculous and missing out!",

We chose the outdoor seating, it was after 930 on a Saturday, and I noted the lower amount of staff.  I can say a lower amount of customers as well however. So my review is totally based on service, I would give it a 2 star, but the food is that good that I would come back; to Arcadia next time, since I still have the sour taste from poor service from this location.   The waitress did give me a box to take home what I did not eat, took my card to ring me up and never came back.  We finished our pitcher of beer, then we finished our waters and finally I could not wait another 10 minutes.  We waited 10 minutes after the waitress picked up the check and card.   When I got up and asked for my check, they handed me someone else's tab??? Then I explained that they had my bill and card already??  So looking down and the table it was under all the these other tabs, like a disorganized table of bills and little clip boards?  Wow, even another employee asked my waitress if she helped another table yet at this point.  I could see the worry in his face.... To sum it up a customer should never have to get up and go look for a credit card after 10 minutes.  I was never rang up and basically my table was forgotten.  Maybe the waitress thought I was enjoying the outdoor seating at 11:30 at night, but at the end of the day I am not looking for an explanation.  I can only tell you that it has been a long time since I have received such poor service from a restaurant.   Next time I visit Arizona I am steering clear of this location for sure.  I might have to drive to Arcadia just to have a great experience of food and service.",

    "text": "I came here 2x on my trip to Phoenix. The first time I liked the place enough  (especially at it's price point) so I brought my co-workers a couple nights later. Unfortunately after only two times of dining here, I got bored of the menu and realized some simple taste-flavor things were off.    Immediately I appreciated the great vibe, nice outdoor seating area, cool crowd and wine and beer selection for price. I have to admit I 'love' the $2.50 shorty beer option and if my review was based only on the ambiance and  wine menu, it'd be a 4-5 star review.  Foodwise, not so much...  First night, I had the pub board which I do recommend. It's fun - pretzels and cornnuts with my cheese and chorizo!! And initially, I was blown away by the size of the bruschetta. The most memorable and yummy version was the tomato jam.   Second time, one of my co-workers got the bruschetta and he again was shocked at the serving size. But the basic tomato/moz/basil one was bland and no bueno. For something so basic, a place with such a high yelp rating should be able to knock it out of the park. I can make a better version of this at home.  The kicker and why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 is my dish. I wanted a salad, but all the salad options were just standard fare - uninspired and uninspiring. In fact so uninspiring that instead of ordering a full salad, I got a half salad/sandwich combo. The salad was just OK and my sandwich was decent, but nothing to rave home about.  Unfortunately, after only 2 times of dining here, I got bored of the menu =(  and I doubt it changes often. If I lived in the area I'd go back for a glass of wine, the ambiance, and possibly to snack on a meat/cheese/pub board, but definitely wouldn't go for a full dinner.",

When you are there, ask for a Pretzel stick. They are hot and devine. Also, make sure that you are there for the $5 pitchers. The 9-Iron is my favorite sandwich on focaccia bread.

I tried a Mimosa, and our waitress seemed really concerned that I didn't like it.  It was good!    The food is amazing.  The menu is very small and limited, but in a good way.  You know that anything on those few pages is really, really well made with awesome ingredients.  I got the 1/2 veggie panini and  1/2 spinach greens salad.  So good!  I don't know which was better.  We were convinced that our waitress had to be an owner or manager based on her attentiveness, but she said not.  Really great service and food, and what seems to be a major selection of adult beverages.",

OK, the service was a touch slow the first time, but no big deal.   The cheese plate was beautiful and tasty: three handpicked cheeses (we had a lovely goat, a hard cheddar, and a brie), some baguette slices, dried fruits, nuts, and marmalade. Loverly.   The bowl of olives is very good, about what you would expect for a bowl of gourmet olives. The olives at TMI are waaaay better because they are marinated in sinful lusciousness, but I digress.  I had the \"pick two\" option with a cup (bowl? the thing was huge) of potato cheddar soup and half of a tuna salad sandwich on ciabatta. My parents had sandwich/salad combos that looked awesome. I particularly like the portion sizes (large) and the fact that you can pick from any of the salads rather than being forced to eat some bland \"side\" salad or Caesar like at other places with this option.  Didn't get any wine, but the selection looks great.  Today I had the soup again and the Autostrada sandwich, which did not disappoint. And it was the most perfect weather to sit out back on the patio.   This is why we live in AZ! I will definitely be back, and can't wait to try the (closer) Campbell location.",

    "text": "After several years of a hiatus to Yelp, this is my first review.  About a month and a half ago, looking for a new place, I suggested going to Postino Central.  While Id been there before, my boyfriend had not.  It had been about two years since I'd been to Postino Central and it wasn't because of any negative experience that I didn't return.  We headed up and parked our car in the packed parking lot and then noticed that there were two awesome bike racks that we'd have to use if we chose to come back.  It was just after brunch... about 1:15 or so (they serve until 1:00pm... last call brunch is at 12:45.)  We got a spot at the bar outside.  It was an uncharacteristic warm Saturday... so you know how it is in Phoenix at times like this... simply beautiful.  We got a pitcher of beer for FIVE BUCKS!  Good beer at that.  What a steal!  We both also got a nice sandwich.  I tried something that's very uncharacteristic for me... the Prosciutto with Brie and my boyfriend got the Autostrada.  The one thing I didn't like was how crunchy my focaccia was at first... but then noticed how easily it was to bite in after I tried it. (I'd just had a root canal a few days prior and was being careful.)  I loved the sweetness of the fig jam and the softness of the brie... I'm not a huge fan of arugula, but this wasn't bad at all, it worked.  I tasted the Autostrada which was filled with all kindsa MEAT.  I love a sandwich with meat... and this one, it had a good amount of yummy Italian meats.  I'd gotten fries with this that were pretty tasty too.  I ended up leaving half of my sandwich which would go to the mouth of my boyfriend for lunch the very next day.  So... we've returned two more times since.  Once to bring a few friends who'd just helped us move into our new place (better than pizza and beer).  We came up by light rail this time, but again missed the brunch, which is one of my favorites.  But did see the Mayor and his kids enjoying the beautiful day.    The next time we went up, it was just the two of us and we rode up on bike.  WE JUST MADE BRUNCH!  Outside bar, last call brunch, two pitchers of delicious $5 beer and music on a very packed patio.  I had the grilled focaccia and he had the scramble.  BOTH were delicious, but honestly I loved the flavor of my herbed butter.  The butter did it for me.  So yup, we'll be back.  I know this place gets over-reviewed, but hey, what's another one.  If I could give it 4.5 stars I would.  I don't like waiting to get into places or to get a seat.",

    "text": "The wife chose Postino Central for date night.  We had been wanting to go to the original for awhile but for whatever reason never made.  This was is a little more convenient and we ended up there.    We arrived around 5:30pm (parked a couple minutes away on Colter) and the place was hoppin'.  Surprisingly, the wait was only 25 minutes.  We were able to order a couple of drinks and enjoy them over at the mini-stand up tables on the side of the outdoor patio.  Our wait (which including the sighting of a local semi-celebrity, so exciting) did not seem too long, and we were seated.  Since we had a chance to review the menu while outside, we were able to order quickly once the waitress came by.  (While we were waiting, it seemed like the music was quite loud inside, though I can't recall noticing it being a problem once actually inside...).    The food was served quite quickly, we each had a salad with a panini.  We both enjoyed our salads (mine was just a side w/ the full panini, nice touch with the pine nuts on the greens) but thought the panini's were a little weird.  It's just that every time I've ever had a panini anywhere else, the 'filling' has been warm.  Here, the outside had obviously been grilled, but not for too long as my roast beef was still cold.  Don't get me wrong, the flavor was still good, but I didn't quite get what I expected.    The drinks we had were good, though, I'd like it better if they extended their wine happy hour so it went past 5pm...  Service here was quite attentive and the (minor) issue was it seemed like a little bit too long of a wait from the clearing of the table until the check was brought, but it was busy, so not that big of a deal.  I give Postino on Central 3 Yelp stars, but in the real world, I'd give it 3.5.  Good service, good tasting food (though not great execution).  If I was going to meet someone for a drink in the area and it was before 5pm, I could be persuaded to go back, otherwise, maybe, but probably not.",

She didn't seem to care and almost apologized as she casually went to get at towel but didn't hand us one. We cleaned up the water on the outside and inside of the handbag with our napkins. After searching for and flagging down the waitress to order our lunch, I ordered the mixed greens salad with turkey. The salad was ok but the turkey appeared to be packaged sliced lunch meat chopped into squares. It was awful. The bread on the salad was extremely tough and chewy. As we were eating, we watched, who I think was the manager, clean the lights over the bar as people sat there eating their lunch. The dust was flying everywhere and also landed on the bar. From our table we could see the dust because the bar was higher.  She didn't wipe the bar off but rather went around and began inspecting the clean glasses. One man was sitting there with his lunch and a glass of water. She cleaned the light next to him anyway. There also seemed to be something going on between two of the gals in the dining area. Not impressed this time around.",

This is NOT your celery sticks and carrot sticks with a dip dish in the middle. Far far from it.

We stopped in after I was done with work.  I was looking over the wine list and our server says, \"You know about our deal tonight, right?\"  Intrigued and unaware I asked her to please go on, \"We have bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20\" WHAT?! That was music to my frugal/foodie ears!!  Any bottle of wine and the bruschetta board comes with 4 flavors of your choosing (4 slices of each!).  We chose the Sauvignon Blanc (The Ned) and for the board we got the: buratta, (minus the bacon) arugula, tomato; white bean and chopped tomato; fig (and other stuff  I can't remember) and salami with pesto.  There's a sparkling Sauv, too...but I wasn't really in the mood for bubbles.  For dessert we ordered the creme brulee.  It was pretty good, but I'm kind of a creme brulee snob, and I thought it could have been cooked a little more.  All in all, a great time here at Postino.  We will definitely be back.",

So, although it's a little further away, I just had to go try the new Postino, and I finally made my way there for lunch last week...  Sure, the valet parking situation sucks (that's my one pet peeve with this place and I knew about it going in), but get over that and you'll have a delightful experience at Postino Central no matter what time of day you're there...  The restaurant is brand new and beautiful - a clean, fun, welcoming atmosphere - just like the Arcadia location.  Service is friendly, iced tea and of course it's the same delicious food as the original location too.  During my recent lunch, I went with the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and added turkey to it too).  Yum!  It's delicious - I could eat that again and again and not get sick of it.  I also love their bruschetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of unique selections).  While the Arcadia Postino is closer to home, I have no problem driving the extra couple of miles to go to the new central location.  (Either way, I'm a happy camper.)  I'm just excited that Phoenix now has double the pleasure (double the fun) of having two Postinos to choose from!",

    "text": "Thank you, Kris and Craig DeMarco, for bringing Postino Central to CenPho: we've been waiting for you.  While we'll miss the charm and $2.79 breakfast of Katz Deli, the refurbishment of this pearl of a 60s building north of Camelback warrants commendation.  The original cinder-block and brick edifice has been preserved, but the remaining vestiges of Katz's greasy blue-boothed diner-feel have gone away.  The stained concrete floor is shined up to reflect the myriad votive candles dotting nearly every ledge space.  A view across the 1,000 square-foot, one-room design reveals smart furniture and several table arrangements: plush booths, a coffee table and vintage chair lounge, traditional wooden two and four-tops, high bistro tables, the long concrete bar inside, and the matching concrete bar on the back of the restaurant, where a comfortable patio meets the inside space with large windows that swing up and open. The large glass doors facing Central Ave. also open to create a breeze from front to back. (You definitely feel that the design of Postino Arcadia informed the restoration of Postino Central.)  My yelper-friend K.G. brought me to a fundraiser here on Saturday night, and though the full menu from Postino Arcadia wasn't available, the pinot noir and chardonnay that were selected for the event were strong choices.  The familiar array of bruschetta and the stand-by cheese platter served on the bar/communal table were abundant and tasty.  My personal favorites remain the tomato, basil, and mozzarella; the warm artichoke spread; the roasted peppers and goat cheese; and the ricotta with dates & pistachios.  Postino continues to succeed with cheeses that retain distinctive and memorable flavor.  This is defiantly not one-taste-fits-all cheese.  From the dessert tray of Tammie Coe delights, I grabbed what I thought was a Russian Tea Ball but soon found out this was a decadent, sell-your-soul chocolate truffle dusted in powdered sugar.  With the pinot chaser, oh, dear me...it was close-your-eyes good.  The servers were in full force with at least 10-15 prim and polished attractive bartenders, runners, wine-glass fillers working the front of the house for the event.  We liked Stevie with the hipster hat and fun haircut the best.  His most memorable rejoinder when we hesitated at his request to fill our glasses again was \"I'm just going to pour it in.  You don't even have to drink it.\"  Occasionally you'd see front and back of the house mingling through the order-up slot window into the kitchen.  Foodies of Phoenix want to see the chefs working their magic.  Now on to the restroom.  The sliding doors to the mens and ladies are frosted.  The circular tiles throughout cause a double-take as does the deep sink.  Noticeably absent is a mirror, and I imagine this will be remedied by the March 30 official opening of the winebar.  But without a mirror to inspect my red-wine teeth, I was a self-conscious swiller.  Postino Central is a three-minute walk from the light rail stop at Camelback and will be a mainstay hangout for CenPho mavens who enjoy wine and open-air lounging.  After the Grand Opening, I'll return to see how they're doing as a winebar with full menu, and I imagine my star rating will reach 5.",

Be sure to take a group of friends so you can sample as many types of bruchetta that you can.

Aside from this hectic picture, the food is simple in terms of elaboration, bruschettas and paninis (in ciabatta or focaccia). I had the Autostrada half with salad. Enough for dinner and good mix of flavors.   By the end we also tried the creme brulee wich was ok. I had a fresh squeezed Mimosa and my friend one of their wines. The funny point, are those little double purpose cards they have on the table where the sugar/sweeteners are. You can glue your chewing gum or flirt with any other costumer.

    "text": "So good! So adorable! I want to give it 5 stars and there is only one reason I'm not going to. The service.  The service was strangely slow. It kept seeming like our server was forgetting about us. Even when he'd come over he seemed pretty distracted. The woman who was refilling the waters also seemed pretty distracted. At one point she dumped so much ice in my husbands cup that it was a little ice mountain sticking out of it. And then she overfilled my cup with water which started spilling on me but she never noticed. They also never even asked if we wanted a second glass of wine or beer. I probably would have gone for it seeing as we had to wait for the food for so so long.  The food though, the food was so worth the wait!!! First of all the appetizer we had, mozzarella and basil was amazing. The basil was really fresh. There seemed to be two types of mozzarella, and the really creamy one on top of the appetizer was to die for. The pesto drizzled across the plate I could drink.  They have a really nice option where you can choose 2 out of 3 things, half sandwich, cup of soup and half salad. All for $9.75. I went for the half vegetarian sandwich and half Italian picnic salad. I loved both. The vegetarian sandwich was unlike any vegetarian sandwich I'd had before. Sure I've had the things on it before, but I'm thinking not together, and maybe not stuff of such high quality. The salad had these delicious cheeses in it along with bacon. What's not to love?  We sat outside on the patio and it was so nice. Really pretty furniture and accents and I loved the outdoor/indoor bar.  So, weird service, if the food had sucked I would have been annoyed, but since it didn't I'll just hope that's not normal because I'm going back for sure.",

The food & casually hip ambiance are definitely the reason that people come here. I have tried the bruschetta, the salad, and several appetizers. All are very high quality and well-plated. The cucumber honey lemonade is mouth-puckering yet refreshing and divine. I like the fact that this a local establishment and when you spend here, your dollars stay local. However, I have never been blown away, or, for that matter, even mildly impressed by their service. The hostess in front rarely smiles. The waiters are curt and to-the-point. We are always seated wedged into the corner by the wine racks, which leaves me feeling a bit cramped and awkward. On our last visit, the bus-boy (more like a bus-man, with a large beard and a ponytail), was actually reaching across our plates to rearrange the salt and pepper shakers WHILE we were eating. Not cool. Get a better bus boy, Postino's, and smile more!",

    "text": "The manager contacted me about the review below. He was Very understanding and easy to talk to. We discussed what my wife and I had experienced and he informed me that they have already taken steps to resolve these issues.    He also mentioned that the Hostess was new and was giving out higher wait times than it really was. This makes sense because it looked busy, but not any busier than normal. (i.e. about 20-30 min wait, which is not long for such a great meal and dining experience.)  So, i am moving my star rating up to a five!  Still great service. A one time anomaly, that is being resolved.  thanks  --------------------------------------- Original Review ---------------------------------------  Need to talk to the Valets!  When we arrived around 8 pm on Monday Aug 12, When we were pulling into the parking lot, we thought another car was going to ram into us. I had to slam on the brakes. As we pulled around to the Valet station, the person that almost ran into us, jumped out of the car behind us. It was a Valet. He took our car and sped off WAY too fast.   We went in to get on the list (usually about a 20-30 minute wait) and we were told it was over 2 hours, so we decided to leave. The second Valet took our ticket and i mentioned to him (very nicely) that they might want to let people know that there was a two hour wait. he was very short with me and said something to the effect of he's been too bust to go check on the wait times.  We watched while the two valets zipped the cars around all too fast. It was crazy. I understand how they run off to get your car, but they should NOT be driving any car like they were that night.   management needs to watch what the Valets are doing and they need to let the valets know when the wait time gets long. If they were telling people \"2+ hours\", i bet most people would leave and that would free up the valets from parking the cars and then 10 minutes later having to go get them again. When we told the people that had just come out of their car that it was a 2 hour wait and they might want to grab the valet before he drove off (too late, he was gone)...They said to us, \"2 hours?!? We'll we will just have him bring it back.\"  We love Postino. We've never had this bad experience with the valets ever. we've never had a 2 hour wait and we do not fault them for being busy. We'll be back, but if this was our first experience we would never go back. That is why I gave 3 starts and not 1.",

I've tried just about everything on the menu and I have never had a bad meal here.   My favorite soup is the creamy chicken artichoke bisque. Soooo good! I could probably drink a bathtub full of that stuff. All the bruschetta are great, but my favorites are the prosciutto/fig/mascarpone cheese, the brie and apples, and the sheeps milk/tomato jam ones. The creme brulee here is also amazing. As far as their brunch goes, the menu is limited, but everything is really, really good.  My one complaint: they changed the veggie sandwich! It's still good now, but it was SO amazing before and I was so disappointed when they changed it! If it ain't broke, don't fix it!",

    "text": "For many years my family and I came here when it was Katz's Deli.  Then, $1.95 got you the breakfast special of two eggs, hash brown potatoes and a bagel of your choice (weekday's only).  Howard and Wanda (?) would be happy to see what has become of their neighborhood place.  Postino Central is still very familiar to those who remember its earlier incarnation but it's now clean and hip, and still very inviting.  If you're a patron of LGO or any number of their other restaurants, you know this group just gets it.   The menu and layout are right out of the original Postino.  Hey, if you've got a winning formula why screw it up (are you listening Hanny's?)?  The outdoor patio has an open bar to the main restaurant a la Chelsea's Kitchen.  It works here too, bringing some of the interior vibe outside.  The principal problem with LGO, it's parking, has been addressed with a large number of spaces and complementary valet parking.  Very nice. I was interested in the bathrooms (that didn't sound right), as their location is basically unchanged from the original, though dramatically improved.  The guy's has a funky sliding door and the girl's two sinks.  I'm guessing this has something to do with the fairer sex's inclination to potty in tandem, though I admit I'm unclear of the benefit of the two sink, one toilet layout.  Interesting. You have to hand it to this group.  They take interesting buildings and make them better (when it's obviously cheaper to just tear them down and start over), they locate in real neighborhoods and improve the property values and they know how to stick with a winning formula.  If you know Postino you won't be surprised by Postino Central but you will be happy you came.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I went there on Saturday with my boyfriend and two other friends of ours for lunch. We arrived around 12:30 and the place was already busy and had a 20-30 minute wait. We decided to sit at the bar and grab a drink while we waited for our table. I couldn't believe their pitchers of beer were only $5 and they had my favorite, Hoegaarden.   When our table was ready the server came over promptly and grabbed us two more pitchers of beer. We started out with the bruschetta however we let the server choose what bruschetta we would be eating that day. If you know me then you know that I'm a snobby/picky eater but I was blown away with the Roasted Peppers and Goat Cheese bruschetta. I would have never tried goat cheese but I'm glad that I did. It was so creamy and flavorful. Also on the plate were: Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. We gulped down the last of our pitcher, ordered around round and had another round of their delicious bruschetta. This time the server brought us: Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese (I'm begging you to try this one), Salami with Pesto and Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios. They were all so mouth watering that I highly recommend all of them.   At the end of our lunch the server brought over a complimentary desert for us, a salted caramel sundae: vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nut's, a pretzel stick and salted caramel. By far the best dessert I've ever had in my life.   Postino's left such an impression on my boyfriend and I that we ordered takeout the next evening. We both decided on the Turkey Panini with a side of salad and the organic chips. They make their own lemon honey dijon salad dressing which tastes great on everything.   I will definitely be a repeat customer at Postino's and I am demanding you to try it out this week/weekend. I promise you will not be disappointed.",

Wellll, as if it couldn't get any better, they just started, that day, $20 for a bottle of house wine AND a plate of bruschetta. How could we resist?  Bruschetta favorites definitely were the smoked salmon and prosciutto with fig and mascarpone, accompanied by the La Linda Viognier.  We ended up doing another round of bruschetta with a bottle of the Riesling, left completely toasted (we live 3 blocks away, phew!), and think this deal is the devil. $40 for 2 bottles of wine and 2 bruschetta plates??? Too damn good.  From the service, the ambience, the food, fantastic wine, there is nothing I can say bad about the joint.",

    "text": "Okay, so Fez/Ticoz/Switch owner take note: Postino does modern/chic/classy/laid-back without it looking like Ikea threw up all over the restaurant.  So I had heard tons of good things about Postino and had been dying to go and never got the chance until just the other night. I was afraid that I had built it up too much in my head and would be greatly disappointed. I was also afraid that eating here would  require me to call my bank and ask for a credit limit increase so I could afford the bill. Postino definitely lived up to my expectations in every way EXCEPT for the fact that the prices were great! I had the half panini and soup meal. I ordered the Tuscan Tuna panini and the white bean and chicken soup FOR LESS THAN $10! Both were so good and flavorful. I wished I had ordered 2! The beer/wine list was great. I ordered whatever beer my friend had and it was really good. I had never heard of it before but he had tried while in Europe and was impressed they had this beer. (Sorry I don't remember what it was called...) The service was great! I loved our server, she was friendly, sweet, and just completely on her game! I want to go back for brunch  and I want to go back soon! Now I chose the $11-30 price range because although you can eat for under $10, you have to have some wine atleast  right? Maybe an appetizer?  Well I do!",

If you do visit you MUST try the bruschetta. You get to choose four types and it is AMAZING. By far the best I have ever had. Definitely try the roasted red pepper. They have a great wine and beer selection and if you can't decide your helpful waitress can narrow down your options based on your taste. My friend ordered the panini which wasn't as good as the bruschetta but is a nice runner up. The lighting is intimate and only compliments the chosen color scheme. If you are looking for a date place this is it. Another thing caught my eye was the unisex bathrooms. I love a place that can offer the sophistication I am looking for while saying farewell to social norms. Keep Phoenix feeling urban Postino.",

I love the indoor/outdoor bar and the feel of the inside. I love the food. The menu looks like it has been updated/revamped a little since the split and everything I ordered was cooked and seasoned perfectly. They have this breakfast dish that is a piece of grilled french bread with an egg and grilled asparagus and a little tomato salad...to die for. I love the cheap wine during the day (even on weekends!). The sparkling Sauvignon Blanc is worth a stretch outside your comfort zone. In general I just really like this place. In fact, I like it enough to forgive the sometimes spotty service...which is the only thing keeping me from a 5 star review.",

Perfect little lunch spot featuring your favorites (i.e. bruschetta planks in all the varieties, yummy paninis and plenty of wine) AND my personal favorite part, the smokin' $5 deal. Just five bucks for a mini pitcher of a draft beer - that's a little over 2 pints' worth of Kiltlifter, Hoegaarden, etc. - or glass of wine = sa-weet. That special runs 7 days a week from 11a-5p. The lunch food items are well priced for what you get, too, with generous portions. Delicious and fresh, for less than $10.

The restaurant is pretty small, and can be crowded as well, so be prepared for a wait from happy hour on through the night.  The food here is absolutely fantastic. Their bruscetta (brew-sket-ta for you illiterate fools) is off the charts. I recommend the ricotta and date. On monday evenings after 8pm you can have bruscetta and any bottle of wine for $20... can't beat that with a stick.

My colleague loved his chicken panini, ordered on focaccia. Loved the MJ breads. Nice wine selection for decent prices.   Service was fine both times - quick and efficient, not overbearing. The inside nicely blends coziness with open airiness, and seems less stuffy then the Arcadia location.  For lunch I arrived at 11:40 and the outdoor seating was full, the inside almost so - consider arriving early or late if going for lunch.   I'm partial to valet parking, so I consider the parking situation perfect.

Anyways, the place is packed every night (even Tuesdays) with Brads and Buffys. Good luck getting in.  We finally got a table on a Sunday morning at 11:05 AM. I guess Brad and Buffy had a tennis match at the club. It somewhat pains me to report that the service was impeccable, the decor was mindblowing (that back porch... wow!), and the food was pretty fantastic. I had a delish salad with shredded chicken, and Spouse enjoyed his Valet-style sandwich.  We will definitely go back once Brad and Buffy have moved on to the newest CenPho hotspot (St. Francis perhaps... if that place ever opens). Until then, drive carefully down Camelback. Brad's behind the yellow H3, and he's had one too many Chardonnays.",

While I think Brie is gross by itself, it sure tastes good when mixed with things like Apples, Pistachios, Salami, Pesto, Tomatoes. and Proscuitto. Our server was a doll as well. A few negatives. We went at 2pm and the place was packed!( Doesn't anyone work on Fridays?lol And if you are unemployed how do you afford to sit in a wine bar?) By 4:00 though the place was dead, just in time for us to leave to catch our movie.-Hmmmmm that didn't make sense to me at all so not sure if that is the norm here. The parking is kind of an issue here. Even though it is free to have them valet your car it is crazy trying to get to the back lot and dangerous. I almost got hit twice. And crazy drivers just leave their cars right out in the middle of the street. Very odd they don't get a ticket or hit. Another issue I have is kids in bars. I don't agree with it and I saw several. I just don't get that at all. I really don't consider Postinos a restaurant or a kid friendly place but hey that's the teacher in me. All in all the food is good here. The restaurant is hip and warehousey looking and we had super great service! I'd go back. ( but maybe at 4pm-ha!)",

    "text": "I'm not terribly inspired by Postino Central, but I'm not complaining either. Yelp says 3 stars mean, \"A-OK!\", which aptly describes how I feel about it (albeit translated into 1950s American English).   The food is as good as the other location. The menu is the same. The staff are pretty much the same. The space is not actually a post office anymore, which makes me question why they decided to call it \"Postino\". (Answer: $$$, i.e., because the original Postino's name is now worth a lot of money on the local scene). I always thought part of the charm of being at the original Postino's was telling an out of town guest the story of how it was an actual nondescript midtown Phoenix post office before being converted into the hip restaurant we're now sitting at, and by the way right now we're sitting underneath a former garage door where the mail trucks would exit from. I guess those days are gone, as LGO's expansionist visions are implemented.   I will likely come here more often than the original, because this location is 2 blocks from a train station and it's a major pain in the arse to park in the other location.   I guess I just feel ambivalent about this place simply because of my natural aversion to chains. I'm admittedly biased against them, in a major way. With McDonald's being on one end of the spectrum and Chris Bianco being on the other, Postino is now one step closer to McDonald's.",

The goat's cheese and roasted red pepper is the best.  Overall, an amazing (my favorite) place in Central Phoenix!",

When they finish adding a Pizzeria, Market and Bar in that little corner I will be stoked.  Thanks for the recommendation on Taco Tote also! Tj",

I haven't been where it's not packed, but it's worth the wait.   My favoritesss are the brie & apples with fig spread and prosciutto with figs & mascarpone. I get them all the time. The last time I went, there was a seasonal with butternut squash and pinenuts with a ricotta spread (pretty sure that's it), and I really liked it. The smoked salmon and pesto, artichoke (only warm one), and fresh mozzarella with tomato & basil are all solid choices too.   As far as other items, I haven't tried anything I haven't liked. But if I don't go for the board or if I'm sharing with a friend, I'd usually opt for the mixed green salad (add chicken) or the turkey panini.   The servers are also really great. They are attentive but not over bearing. I have never felt rushed, even though I know many more people are hoping we'd get up from our seats.   Cozy, quaint atmosphere. Great service (though not phone service). Wine and board nights.   Love. Love.",

Postino's has enlightened me: their bruschetta is absolutely amazing! The ingredients are so fresh! It's delicious! It's easy to eat! But I'm getting ahead of myself...  My mom and I came here, lured by the rave Yelp reviews, while on a road trip through Phoenix. My mom ordered a glass of cava, which she liked, and we started off with a plate of bruschetta (four flavors for $14). My favorite was the salmon, pesto, and capers - the pesto is fresh and exciting, and the whole combination makes for the perfect mix of savory flavors! My mom's favorite was the mascarpone, fig, and prosciutto, which was both sweet and a little bit savory. We also got the artichoke bruschetta (great depth of flavor- absolutely delicious!), and the traditional tomato-basil-mozzarella bruschetta (the tomatoes were fresh and to die for). Everything was amazing. Each bruschetta is cut into four pieces, so they're non-messy to eat and easy to trade. The ingredients were so fresh, and so capably combined! I absolutely loved everything. I almost wish I lived in Phoenix.  After we had the bruschetta we realized we were hungrier than we thought, so we got the white bean and artichoke dip plate as well as a bowl of chicken dumpling soup. I got to have more of the artichoke dip, and the white bean dip was very good as well.   What I loved even more than the bruschetta (I know, how is that possible!) was the atmosphere. We sat on the 'outside' part of the restaurant, and it was just perfect for relaxing, talking, and sharing the finger food. The whole atmosphere is relaxed and fun. DON'T MISS!",

The reason I keep getting this sandwich is that it's a perfect blend of savory and sweet. The sandwich comes with a side pine nut salad too. I've seen others get the bruschetta board and I've heard nothing but good things about those dainty, tasty bites.

And that way you can try more stuff  they also have lots of happy hour and late night deals which I would check out if you're looking for something around that time. Decor and ambiance is cute too. Good for a group of friends because it is a little livelier but also fun for a date night.",

The fresh mozzarella bruschetta was just okay. I think it would have been better if there was an olive oil or more spices with it but the sweet and spicy pepper jam was definitely my favorite.  We came on Sunday and I ordered a mimosa and French toast from the brunch menu. The orange juice was fresh and the French toast was very tasty. I will definitely be back.",

Advertised as Shishito peppers, pecorino, Sierra Nevada mustard.  That's exactly what they were.  No salt, the pecorino was so light it had zero taste and didn't add anything to the dish.  And Sierra Nevada mustard?  It was a really odd combination and we didn't have any more after the first bite.  But really - no salt?  Usually a light sprinkling of Fleur de sel - or a sprinkle of sea salt or kosher brings out the flavor of the shishitos.    The panini's that we ordered were ok in flavor.  Loved the bread - just the right amount of crunch.  I ordered the Nine Iron - Sugar cured smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and Dijonnaise.  The flavors were spot on - but I felt the quantity of protein left a little to be desired.  My dining companion ordered the Roast Beef - Wood roasted premium beef with aged Port Salut cheese, red onion, pickles, Sierra Nevada mustard and mayo.  I tasted it and it was overpowered with the mayo - it was a mayo sandwich with some other things thrown in for good measure. We were guests of another party.  They raved about the food before coming - so we felt a bit shy to refuse the food.  Desert - we shared a creme brulee. A W E S O M E!  Very good!  It looks like the boards and bruschetta are the way to go here.  Perhaps we'll return for a nibble session and give that a try.",

The restaurant was incredibly busy, but that didn't take away from the great service we received.  The staff was prompt about getting us our bottle of wine and informed us off the bat that the food would be a little backed up and would take 15-20 minutes.  When our food came there was a mix up with one of the bruschettas. We told our server and she immediately went and got us the one we had ordered within 2 minutes. I was very impressed with the staff and how the restaurant was running as a whole for such a busy evening. I looked around and all the tables I could see looked happy.

We tried 4 different ones for $15. the priscuitto with the figs and marscapone. That was so good. The bacon with fresh mozzerealla was pretty on point too. The crispy of the bacon was perfect.

Our waiter told us that they are opening a Postino Central in Houston, well I am hoping they will open one in the Dallas /Fort Worth Area!!!",

The same goes for the food and beverage menu. I particularly like the \"tomatoes and basil\" appetizer which is really more of a beautiful stacked Caprese with burrata and pesto. Just get it. The Antioch Zinfandel is also a steal at $5 a glass during happy hour.",

    "text": "Postino Central is the pinnacle of perfection. It represents the peak of human endeavor and is worthy of every Nobel Prize past, present, and future. This is the highest praise, I know, but it is completely deserving because Postino is more than just a restaurant... It is holy ground. And modern science can prove that.  Bruschetta is, at its core, a simple dish. Traditionally, it is served as a slice of toasted bread rubbed with garlic, drizzled with olive oil, then topped with an assortment of ingredients. But Postino takes this minimalistic preparation to new levels, turning every slice of toasted bread into a dynamic canvas that highlights the finest quality ingredients. They offer eleven varieties of bruschetta, each with a signature taste to tickle your palate. And through the eleven options, there is not a single flavor profile that goes uncovered, no spectrum of taste that is lost. From savory prosciutto to herbal red peppers, dinner at Postino dances with your taste buds in every way.  My personal favorite - brie and apples with fig spread. The apple slices are fresh and the brie is so delicate. And the fig spread... Ahhh the fig spread gives a subtle sweetness... Then they all come together in that first bite, so sensual, so seductive. Like an exchange of honey betwixt bees or a whispered promise to your lover, the first bite is intimate... a pleasure you just may lose yourself in... And it's simply exhilarating.  Postino is a necessary part of the human experience. I feel that words cannot do this restaurant justice so my review will conclude shortly. Just know that should you ever walk through Postino's doors, you will feel the universe expanding in that initial bite. And don't forget to order a bottle of wine... Because bottled wine is bottled poetry. Bon appetit!",

    "text": "I have been to this postinos several times and havent written a review yet. Will try to sum up all my experiences here in one review :p   First off, the place is excellent as the ratings suggest it to be the #2 restaurant on yelp in PHX (behind Postinos Arcadia). The biggest attraction for this place is of course the \"$20 for a bruschetta board and any wine bottle\" on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8pm. Make sure you get there by 7 atleast on these days, bcs finding a table is like hell here. Negative points for the long wait.  Each Bruschetta board comes with 4 of your choice. Since I am a vegetarian my favs are Ricotta With dates & pistachios, Fresh Mozzarella With tomato & basil, White Bean With chopped tomato, Roasted Peppers With goat cheese, Chopped Tomato With pesto, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese.   In addition I also love the vegetarian panini. Their wine collection is ok as well. Not too many beers on taps but I love the cut-throat pitcher. The staff is friendly for most part, had great experiences on most days I was there, except ofcourse when I encounter sacastic bartenders. Like I always say, you cannot be sarcastic and be a good server in my dictionary, need to know when not to cross the line.   I wll keep going here anyways for the lovely food and since we just got a biggg gift card for ourselevs :)",

Service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. My husband asked for a beer recommendation based on other beers he likes and the server made a great suggestion that he ended up loving. I had the sparkling sauvignon blanc which to me tasted like overpriced champagne. Our friend ordered the only Riesling on the menu and really enjoyed it. The server was kind enough to let us order a pb&j from the kids menu, and it came with a generous portion of apple slices, grapes, and potato chips.   I liked the ambience and decorations. Our friend thought the music was a little sleepy but there were at least a few songs that I really liked. I'd like to go back for lunch sometime since they have a nice selection of salads and paninis and $5 glasses of wine before 5pm.",

From the outside you imagine the inside will be very modern with clean lines and relaxing  colors.  I may be a sucker for large double-sider bars where one side is inside and the other is outside.   As you walk in to their inside dining room, there is a medium size wine collection in racks surrounded by tables to one side.  I think they could find a less space consuming way to house these wines by they are still a unique way to look at them. They also have a great selection of beers both local and domestic.   My friend and I got the cheese and meat platter as well as a pizza. Everything was to die for.  My mouth still waters and its been over 10 months. Although this place is a bit off the beaten track, if you have a car it's a must for travelers. Gives a perspective of Arizona architecture that may other places cannot take advantage of.",

Candlelight and sexy music add to the already chic ambience Postino has.    The food?  Bliss.  I can still remember how the creamy ricotta and sweet figs on my bruschetta tantalized my tongue that first night.  I can feel the velvety red wine at the back of my mouth and drizzling down my throat.    Parking is a bit of a hassle, but they have valet for a reason.  If you're stuck waiting for a table, squeeze in at the bar and grab a glass of wine (or three).  People watching is almost as fun here as eating.    Now that there is a Postino in the East Valley, I am hoping Postino Central will get a little less busy... if only to serve my selfish purposes.  I love everything about this place and I hope to be back soon.",

We also ordered the brushetta. Their brushetta is the number one reason I frequent Postinos regularly. As far as the brushetta goes, you can't really go wrong. I've tried everything and have loved them all. The newest one on the menu is a sheep's milk cheese with tomato jam. It is probably my 2nd favorite. The prosciutto with figs & mascarpone is my number 1.   If your looking for a hip, fun and delicious wine bar/restaurant your search is over.",

The paring lot is so damn small and it's not necessary to vallet. Plus they rolled down both my windows... my passenger side window is broken and doesn't roll back up. So naturally I didn't tip him because I knew I'd be driving around Phoenix for days with my window stuck down.  Anyway! Love the atmosphere and the live band, I mean, come on. ho has a live band at a Sunday brunch, that's awesome! The wait staff seemed a bit hungover or tired or just disinterested because our waitress wasn't the most pleasant woman I'v ever met. None the less, the food was unbelievable.   Second compliment (I know my reviews seems to have a lot of complaints but I'm rating them high because the food is bomb) was that our waitress was quite displeased to have to split the check and Postinos jacks up the gratuity and then splits it evenly. So even if you ordered a small plate SOMEHOW you end up paying the same amount as the person who ordered the smoked salmon. That was kind of annoying.",

The bartenders were really sweet and really cute, and the service in general was awesomeness starting with the hostess on down.

Service seems to be the object of concentration in Postino Central reviews. My experience was about as good as it could get, short of having a hot male waiter. We had a reservation, so the wait was non-existent. I did notice three groups of people waiting... make reservations, people, if you wanna avoid a wait!   The hostess and waiter were very friendly and attentive. The waiter was very knowledgeable and recommended some excellent wine pairings. We actually DIDN'T have the bruschetta, which I'm kind of regretting seeing how beloved it is (next time, Postino C., next time!), but the sandwich and soup combo I had was superb. I think it was the chicken with sun dried tomato pesto and corn chowder.  Didn't have to deal with the valet since one of us had a relative who lived just up the street, so we parked there and enjoyed an evening stroll. Hey, it's good for digestion.",

You really can't go wrong with any of them. If you go on Monday or Tuesday night after 8pm, a bottle of wine and board of this gloriousness is only $20 bucks. Get on that. If you're not in the mood for bruschetta, the Tuna Melt is out of this world...order it with a side of Sierra Nevada mustard and you won't go wrong.   The brunch here on the weekends is incredible, too. Central is the only one that offers it so don't try going to the other ones and ordering the BELT sandwich, because you won't get it....but come here and you'll experience the fantastic brunch  Free valet, too.",

What seems like a short menu was brilliantly prepared with quality ingredients! The bruschetta was at the top of the list; regardless of which 4 you chose, not one fell short of amazing. Both the Butcher's Block and Pub Board had an amazing selection of flavors. If I had to pick, the pretzels with sweet honey mustard, white cheddar and Schreiner's Chorizo were at the top of my list. Everything paired perfectly with my Tempranillo from Spain! We didn't have the Panini's but they did looks delicious and very large like a 5\" square. We had a fantastic time and look forward to our next visit to make our way through what we originally thought was a short menu. We can't wait for the other 2 stores to open; which will make it 6 stores in total. Keep up the excellent work and keep on rocking!!",

    "text": "Have been to Postino's now three times and I must say the food consistently lives up to expectations as does the wine.  I love the Midtown location as the beautiful bar opens up to a great patio.    The first two times we went, the staff was very helpful and friendly and the music was light jazz - very relaxing.   I would love to have given this  restaurant 5 stars but  i need to give it a 4 star rating because of what transpired during my third visit.   The third time was lunch with co-workers and the music was very grating and loud (Rap/grunge -which is not my cupof tea, especially when trying to have a converstion) .  When we asked our server if the music could be turned down or perhaps changed to someting less frenzied, she replied.  \"No - I don't have any control over the music and I haven't received complaints from other customers.\"   Needless to say we weren't too happy with her response but we did not want to make a scene  nor let this ruin our lunch .  She was pretty cold towards us after my request which, unfortunately for her,  affected her tip.    That aside, whatever you order here, bruschetta, sandwiches, salads - everything is delicious and in good -size portions.  I will be back - just next time I hope the music  is  a bit more relaxing and the server with the negative attitude is not there.",

    "text": "One of my favourite spots to eat, and it's even better on a Monday or Tuesday night when you get a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20. That may seem like a lot at first, but considering their bottles of wine alone are usually $20+ it's a hell of a deal. Their bruschetta is amazing! I don't know that I've had one that I didn't like. The fig and marscapone is a favourite, as is the smoked salmon, but they're all fantastic. And no tiny, hard pieces of bread here. Big pieces of crust bread smothered in whichever flavour you want and a board comes with 4 pieces, which is always more than enough for the two of us. For dessert, try their salted caramel sundae. It's ridiculous! The ice cream is smooth and perfectly creamy, the salted caramel sauce comes on the side in a tall shot glass, and the whole thing is garnished with chocolate covered corn nuts. No, really. And they're great! (and this is coming from someone who doesn't like corn nuts... at all!)   The patio is really dog friendly, the staff is usually very attentive, though service can be a little sluggish on Mondays and Tuesday, simply because they're usually so busy. If you go on either of those nights, be prepared for a wait, but it's usually not too bad. The ambiance is great and it's a perfect date place.",

They do not allow smoking on the patio - smokers can go around the side of the building to partake.  Great wine list, also has beer and pop.  No mixed drinks.  Light food menu.  We ordered off the appetizers and it was more than enough and had the Salted Caramel sundae for dessert.  If you get there before 5:00 p.m wine by the glass is $5.00 and pitchers of beer for $5.00 - not a bad deal.  Very nice staff and free valet parking.  We'll definitely return - a very nice alternative to the chain restaurants that seem to have overtaken Phoenix.",

Their wine reco's were pretty good and have a great list of wines by the glass.  They also sell a good variety of wines by the bottle in their shop.  We had an assortment of their bruscettas -- so very creative and all were delightful. I couldn't pick a fav but I must admit I loved the one with the marscapone cheese. The hard part was choosing what to order. I also had a salad/panini combo -which was so fantastic.",

I had an enjoyable time sitting on the patio.  Definitely need to go back to try their wine selection since I could not partake last night.  I only had time and an appetite for something small so I chose the Bella Postino.  Warm artichoke spread, white bean hummus and MJ Breads.  The spreads were tasty, the bread not so much.  I imagine the bread would have been heavenly (after all it is MJ's!) if it had been fresh and soft, but alas it was day old and crispy.  Not a big fan of crispy bread.  Perhaps next time I'll make mention and have the bread subbed out with soft fresh bread.  Looking forward to visiting again and trying some other items and wine !",

It was fig, apple and brie bruschetta, and the most gorgeous local tomato, basil and pomegranate salad.  Anyway, after the wine tasting, we got a table and ordered their 20 dollar bottle and bruschetta special, which is a selection of 4 bruschettas and a bottle of anything on the menu.   First of all its a smokin deal, and the bruschetta is great, and there are like, 10 to choose from.  I highly recommend it!",

But I was a little concerned that the beer selection was somewhat haphazard compared to the care that the restaurant has placed elsewhere in the menu.  At Catherine's urging, I went for my first bite of Postino's signature bruschetta selection last Saturday with a couple of friends.  All I can say is that it was yummy and a huge improvement in positioning from what I recall of my last visit to their Arcadia location (a couple years ago).  I remember previously thinking that Postino was little more than an average but trendy neighborhood spot.  This time around, my only recommendation besides improving the beer menu (only one local brew!) is that they perhaps drop the price of the bruschetta by about $3-$5.  For afternoon snacks and drinks, I thought $45 for two was pushing it a little.",

I haven't been to the original in years so I can't really compare it but it feels the same.  Open, airy, industrial, fresh, and classy are all words I would use to describe it.  Really, a great conversion.  There is almost no parking.  It is a bit sickening to think about when you consider how crowded this place gets.  I appreciate transit oriented development as much as the next person, but the poor neighborhood around this is going to get mobbed.  The LRT is close but might be enough of a walk to turn people off (especially during the summer).  They have valet parking but I refuse to let anyone else drive my car so that was out of the question.  We parked across the street by the gas station, prayed, and ran across Central to get there.  There are like three entrances to this place but I guess you just sit wherever.  Service was good, friendly, and knowledgeable.  We were wicked disappointed that there was no sangria.  For a wine place, there should be sangria.  I had some Lion Stout beer that rocked my world.  The wife had some Riesling.  It was good too.  We ordered the NYC grilled cheese for a starter and it was great.  Came with pesto, mustard, and catsup and was sliced into like 6 small pieces.  It rocked.  I ordered some panino that was rocking a bunch of Italian meats, tomato, and some cheese.  It was great.  It came with homemade chips that would have been better with some more of that catsup.    The place was really just quality.  The crowd was good at 4 which was surprising.  The patio was packed.  The bar is pretty cool.  No hard liqueur but that's okay.  In all, well done!",

The wine by the glass list is small but very good, when the food arrives it's even more interesting and tasty than you expected when you read about it on the menu (excluding the bruschetta which I found uninteresting), but I think the best thing is that this is a great place to hang out for an afternoon.  Staff are friendly but not in a goofy way, helpful when you need without being condescending and, unlike so many wine bars, professional in appearance and behavior.  Good people watching with a pretty diverse clientele.    I haven't done my usual Saturday chores for two weeks now, instead finding excuses to hang out here all afternoon.  baaaaaad  I prefer this location to the one on Campbell because it's airier and has better service.    Recommendations?  If you can't decide, get The Plate which has bits of all kinds of things, all of which are wonderful. Try the sparkling sauvignon blanc for a nice change from the typical white wine.  And of course try to do so before 5pm to get your wine for $5.",

    "text": "I did some day drinking at Postino yesterday and it was great.  The outdoor/indoor patio feel was awesome for getting out of the AZ sun.  They have $5 wine from 11-5 daily as well as average priced drafts and beers.  I had framboise (belgian raspberry beer) which was $10 ($12 at most other places I've been to).  They also let you take beer to go for 1/2 price which is really a good deal if you want to try something different but only want one to take home.  Or for my framboise that would make it $5 which is no different than what it would be at the store.  I didn't try the food but was drooling over everyone else's... there are a million kinds of bruschetta that looked really awesome.  The panini's looked decent as well.  The vibe is kinda of midtown, hipster, \"FEZ-like\" but it was quiet and relaxing too.  All around good place to have a mid-day drink and it's now on my list to go back and try the food!",

We tried some soup, sandwich, and bruschetta, all of which was really delicious and we had a lot of leftovers because of the generous portions. The waiter came by frequently. The restaurant is located along Central, but its location is so close to a residential area that it feels to me to be more of a neighborhood hangout place and less of a huge Central Ave attraction. I will be coming again!",

When we did finally get a chance to order more wine the server ran off without asking what we wanted. I guess she assumed we wanted to stick with the wine we started with, but we didn't. Dishes were not very clean. All around disappointing trip this time.",

We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and a bruschetta and were very pleased with the service and quality of food.  The place was packed!  I think this neighborhood has been waiting for something like this for some time.    I won't miss the old Katz Deli too much though it was a part of local history; the new Postino is a welcome change and I love the openness of the back bar and patio.  It's a nice place and we will be back!  Oh, and expect to hear a lot of 80s new wave music, at least that's what was playing when we showed up...the Cure, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode seem to be their theme.  Like their other location, expect the finest breads from MJ Bread as well as tasty treats from Tammie Coe Cakes.  mmmmm.  And you'll need to use the valet unless you get there between 11-4 (and you'll get $5 wine for being early).",

The service is here is awful!! We went on a Friday night and even with 3 bartenders behind the bar  and a near empty bar, it was impossible to get service. They were very interested in talking to eachother though. They take empty glasses away without offering refills and when the food arrived I had to retrieve some silverware and plates since the bartender(s) didn't even acknowledge that we needed anything. No joke, it took almost 10 minutes to get the attention of that bartender to get another glass of wine or a beer. The food is what keeps us going back and they do have a great happy hour with $5 glasses of wine. We will try the other location next time to see if the service is any better there.",

The patio was just about full, and within an hour there was a waiting list for both inside and outside dining, so try to hit this place during off-hours.  Service was friendly, and the bruschetta was great--for those who haven't done the Postino's thing before, you pick four flavors out of twelve and get a bite of each for each member of your party.  The peppers and goat cheese, the fig and apple, and the prosciutto were outstanding.  Paninis and grilled cheeses floating by looked delish.  Wine was reasonably priced, and a lot more so from 11-4.  You can watch the poor valets scurry about in the sun while you lounge on the patio, reminding you that you're glad you walked or light railed in.  The place is open-air, even inside, and I'm interested to see how it works in the heat of summer.  We had a perfect springtime afternoon in the sun on their patio--just make sure one of your foursome brings sunglasses. :)",

    "text": "Sorry Switch, My Florist, Bombaros, La Bocca, Main Ingredient, and other wine cafes that sell gourmet sandwiches and salads. Postino's has you all beat! Why you ask? Postino's has the best deals with consistent and high quality, delicious food and wine. I have been to Postino's on Central more than a handful of times and there is a reason I go back over and over. . . because you people make my dining experience so good.   First of all, Postino's has the best brucetta. Hands down! They use larger pieces of bread and their ingredients are really flavorful. Their sandwiches taste just a little bit fresher and yummier than other restaurants. I cannot put my finger on what it is exactly, but it is fabulous. They also have a great wine and beer program that changes every month. They seem to be able to incorporate different malbecs in their wine list, which is a super plus for me! Their new brunch menu is spectacular and although I have only ordered one thing on the brunch menu so far, I have seen the brunch plates come out of the kitchen and they all look so scrumptious.   Second, Postino's has deals that you just can't miss. Monday and Tuesdays after 8:00 pm you can order a bottle of wine and board of brucetta for only $20! $5 wine glass or pitcher of beer everyday until 5:00 pm. If you sign up for their email list, you get coupons for free meals occasionally. I just noticed that on Wednesdays they have a special word deal on facebook, when you write the word on a business card, you receive all glasses of wine for $5. During this time of recession, you make dining with reserve wine affordable.",

They take historic buildings and turn them into awesome neighborhood restaurants with amazing food, local ingredients and edgy culture. Oh and a great place for a first date!  If you're going for some appetizers, make sure you try the Mozzarella and Tomatoes! The Mozz is super fresh and those Caprese lovers out there will keep coming back for more.  Another go-to is the Butcher's Block - An assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, asparagus, nuts and crostini. And I'm a sucker for olives. WOW! This plate has an amazing quality of meats and cheeses, with tons of extras, you can't go wrong here!  Great ambiance, great bar, did I mention the STAFF is awesome, friendly and has it together. Postino will always be a REILLY favorite, so thanks for being you!",

Also, for all the old school Phoenicians, you'll understand when I say that I was able to sit there and magically transport myself back to the days when this was Katz Deli and I was eating another delicious sandwich in this very spot, about a million years ago.  I so easily visualized the old Katz deli counter right in front of me, it was kinda eerie..",

Even though my main plate was not up to par, this place still deserves 5 stars because of the amazing service!

I had my 2 dogs with me and we sat outside. A haboob was forming and they were ushering everyone inside. They offered to let my dogs be in the lobby and I even offered to just eat in my car with the dogs - they are service animals, specifically ESA, but I didn't have their vests or tags on me. They wouldn't even hear of it lol! They insisted on us eating inside even with the dogs, assuming my critters didn't bark or disturb other people. My guys are fairly good. They just hang out underneath the table or sit on a chair next to me when we go places.   I tipped them very well for the amazing customer service and making sure my 'fur-babies' were well taken care of. :)   Food wise - Bruschetta is second to none! It is truly the best I've ever had! I always get the cucumber honey lemonade! I have never had a bad experience here! I think they are few & far between and if someone does have a bad experience here then someone is just off on their game that day. It happens. Love this place, highly recommend! Whenever our CA people come to AZ we insist on them checking out Postino. Your life just isn't complete without trying it once :P",

As soon as I order my food with someone, it is entered and I've never had to wait long to get anything.  Must haves: Cucumber Lemonade, Bruschetta Board (at least 1 apples&brie), and for dessert, the Chocolate Bouchon is to die for!   There are always great deals on wine, so grab a bottle while you're there and celebrate",

I visited a few weeks ago to pick up their rose box, and the young lady helping me was very friendly and helpful.  In case this is the first review of you've ever read about Postino (no apostrophe S, thank you very much), here's the drill: come on Monday or Tuesday night for board and bottle. You get a board of tasty bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $25. Awesome deal! I've seen a few people complain that the price rose recently, and it makes me roll my eyes. There's no better deal (especially considering the quality of wine) in the Valley.",

We arrived right at 9  am opening (hey, I get up early these days...) and were really the only patrons on the patio for some time.  Our server and the other staff were incredibly friendly and patient, never rushing us to order and keeping water and coffee cups full. It made for a super pleasant morning. My only complaint about Postino was they should have told us about the national potato shortage! That's the only realistic explanation I could think of for the skimpy serving of breakfast potatoes that came with my meal. It was actually pretty funny. I think we counted about 18 pieces of small, diced potatoes on my plate - about maybe a 1/4 cup worth. The eggs were good. The 2 strips of bacon were good. The coffee was good. The fruit salad was old. I thought the meal was a little pricey for my taste, but hey, you're also in a very cool atmosphere which is definitely worth something.  So no doubt I will return to this cool hipster patio to have cocktails and some bruschetta.",

I was here to celebrate a friend starting a new job. A party of 6 without reservations on a Sunday afternoon we had to wait for seating on the patio for about an hour. Not unexpected and it was a gorgeous afternoon to just hang out and chat.  The patio seating was worth the wait. Service was a little slow as the place was packed. I had the Tuscan Tuna panini which was really good and also filling. I did not hear any complaints about the food in our group. I would definitely go back here.",

They have inside seating and outside seating area with misters. They're very attentive when customer walks in so we got seated right away. The restuarant has a rustic modern feel to it. Mostly wooden bar and tables and wine rack in the aisle, I think it's very neat.   We ordered the bruschetta, which we can choose 4 toppings. We pick:  *fresh mozzarella, tomato & basil *prosciutto di parma, fig & mascarpone *warm artichoke spread *smoked salmon & pesto Then we ordered the vegetarian panini. Everything tasted delicious, except the fresh mozzarella, tomato & basil bruschetta it can use a little seasoning because it's a bit bland so we add little sprinkle of salt just for taste.   Service was great and he was very attentive to our table to fill up our glasses of water and see if we need anything else. Everything was great for dinner. I would definitely come back again for happy hour! Their happy hours are from opening until 5pm everyday with any selections of beer and wine for $5.",

Brie, Apple and fig spread : mind blowingly delicious. Best one on the board. 2. Mozzarella, tomato and basil: okay-ish tasting. 3. Ricotta, dates and pistachio : top 2. You would literally moan after eating this. I'm serious. 4. Piquillo pepper and goat cheese : wouldn't recommend this.  Vegetarian Panini - quantity is huge for the price, worth a try.

Details: My coworkers and I came here after work on a weekday. This was my first time coming here. Now, I'm not a crazy fan of bruschetta, but I did ordered a few. I also ordered the skewer which it was also good, but kind of wish it wasn't $12 just for two skewers. The 2 skewers were one fish and one steak. However, for four bruschetta for $12, I think it's worth it. I like the salmon and the one with pesto the most. This place also has beer and wine. I ordered a moscoto for myself and it was really good. My moscato taste light and refreshing. Now I'm obsessed with the moscato brand that they had. AS for one of my coworker, she also ordered a panini along with an order of bruschetta but they never brought it out. My coworker didn't bother tell them about it because she got full already. But by the time we finished everything and they still didn't brought it out. She mentioned it to the waiter that she never got her panini order but it's okay since she was really full. They went to check it and saw they forgot about it, they still made her the panini and let her take it home. They didn't charge her for it since they forgot about it. I thought that was very generous of them to do that. Overall, I had a great experience here and so did my coworkers.",

The best nights to come are Monday and Tuesday where you can get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20!! Such a steal!!

    "text": "Wow! This place lived up to the hype. Went here Monday night for their $25 Board & Bottle special. Starts at 8pm we arrived a little early to grab a table  on the patio. Our service was great. You're close to other people but it didn't seem super loud or like you had to yell to hear the people at your table. I didn't have a single item that wasn't delicious. The warm artichoke & the burrata/bacon/arugula/tomato were my absolute favorites. Also had the: Brie/apple/fig & pepper jam/goat cheese.  They slice the bruschetta for you also which is so nice. Makes it easy to pick up and bite. Everyone I was with loved what they got also. AWESOME! A must go in Phoenix. Plus you can't beat the price. Also for the bottle - you get to choose any bottle from their menu! Whites, reds, rose, bubbles. It's a steal for $25. And if you don't finish your bottle they will cork it for you at no additional charge.",

    "text": "Just love coming to Postino's every time I come to Phoenix to visit. There are now a few locations, but my go to is located down Central. Monday's are one of my favorite days to come here. You can do a board of mixed bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $25. The list of bottles to choose from is pretty decent and the selections of bruschetta are hard to choose from; they're all equally delicious. This particular special starts around 8pm and goes until close. If you arrive a tad before, seating is usually not too bad. However, if you come a little later be prepared to wait at least up to an hour or longer. Staff here is always very friendly and patient considering this is one of there busiest nights. Overall, I can't wait to come back and divulge In more tasty bruschetta and delicious wine!",

    "text": "I love coming here. Postino has been my absolute go to in the Valley for about ten years. There are more locations now, but Postino Central was the first love and closest to my home in PHX. I love the outdoor seating here. Inside it can be a bit loud, but still a great atmosphere. The food hasn't changed much over the years and that's the best thing about it. The prices really haven't either. Getting a bruschetta board and a pub board to share is a great way to go. I also love their raspberry chicken salad. Really, anything is good. The $20 for a full bottle of wine and a board late night can't be beat. All day wine is $5 a glass or $5 for a pitcher of beer. I mean, come on. It's been that way for ten years at least.   On the weekends and evenings it is a cluster to park here and the wait can be long. To be fair, there is an additional lot across the street that is open for parking at all Upward Projects restaurants. But on a weekend it is slammed, too. Joyride, Federal Pizza, Windsor, Churn, and Postino are all right here and that is great - but busy by PHX standards. If you are from another major city, it will seem normal. But everything else is a steady 5 stars for me. If I could only go back to one of my Valley favorites, it would always be Postino.",

So when I was in Phoenix a few weekends ago, I wasn't the least bit perturbed when our reservation for Tuck Shop fell through and we ended up there.  The atmosphere was mature which I seem to enjoy more and more these days, and the decor was that of Elizabeth Taylor's demeanor: chic, but not uptight. The structure of the dining area was impressive, giving several options to patrons. There were bistro tables for two, a long wooden raised table with benches for a large group, of course the bar, a sexy booth for a smaller group, and then an area (where we sat) that had some modern couches and fabric chairs and a little trunk / table. And the music selection was even better. Cozy can't even begin to sum up that place.  The wine selection was wonderful and the servers were charismatic. The food was so delish, although everything does seem to run on the cheesy side, so if you're lactose intolerant like I've become, then talk to your server or order one of their amazing salads. Overall, everything was great, great, great.  When I'm in Phoenix again, I'll definitely be going back to Postino!",

We saw the deal for a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20 and just couldn't pass it up.  The restaurant was beautiful on the inside, and had a very cool, semi-secluded outdoor patio that made you feel like you weren't even in the city!  We go the Salami with Pesto, the Burrata Bacon, Arugula & Tomato, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto, and the Warm Artichoke Spread. Every one of the them was absolutely delicious. My favorites were the Burrata and Bacon, as well as the Smoked Salmon. The bacon was thick, not burnt or too crispy. The tomato and burrata complimented the smokiness of the bacon very well. The smoked salmon was extremely fresh, it reminded of growing up on lox and bagels. It was the kind of thing you could eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The other two we're also great. The salami looked like artisan meat, not just something you get at the store. From what we've heard, their Butcher's Block (meats and cheese) sounded amazing, and looked delicious, too. The Warm Artichoke Spread was everything that you'd expect. Not too creamy, like some restaurants make, it was perfect.   We cannot recommend this place enough, and we can't wait to try the rest of the bruschetta's!  If you're foodies like us, make sure to check out the Whistl app for iPhone! We've been using it regularly and have found so many new great places!!  Happy Eatings Everyone!",

Their wine list seems to change quite frequently, and they always have a great selection. And they have a pretty good beer selection too, for those non-wine drinkers (I'm still questioning if those folks are human or not).   My favorite bruchetta is......umm.... all of them. I love going with 3 or 4 girlfriends, because we can get one of each kind, and bathe in the deliciousness.   Check it out, you won't regret it!

It should be THAT place where \"everybody\" knows your name or that Go To spot when family and friends are in town and you want to make some kind of an impression. Recently met some girlfriends there for Happy Hour (which runs from 11 am to 5 pm daily) and our servers, Patrick and Kristen, made the experience even better.  They were so positive and attentive but in a way that was not obnoxious. Postino's atmosphere felt as if you were sitting at your friend's kitchen table.  It's spacious, well lit and the decor is not heavy. Man, their meals are big.  If you go, it's better to share even though the price is reasonable. I'd like to suggest that you valet park and make sure you have cash to tip the attendants.  It took me 10 minutes to parallel park my car, but that's beside the point I'm trying to make here...tee hee.",

It's also one that you don't need to dress up in black like a starving artist or Scottsdale nightclubber in order to fit in.  Postino has a bright and modern ambiance and awesome food.  The bruschetta is fantastic.  We tried (from best to not quite best) the white bean with tomato, smoke salmon pesto, brie apple and fig, and mozzarella with tomato and basil.  I could have kept eating all of them until my stomach exploded.  The flavor combinations were amazing and the ingredients were fresh.  If you can't find one that you like, you my need to have your taste buds examined.  We also split a chicken and mozzarella panini.  Delicious.  The sun dried tomato mayo and the arugula are a tasty complement to the protein.  The sandwich is as fresh and well prepared as the bruschetta.  Add a glass of wine and you have the perfect little meal.",

We also had, like, 7 different servers for some inexplicable reason, who wouldn't listen to ANY of our requests to stop filling up our water glasses every 3 seconds.  We didn't want water, we wanted food.   We ended up going across the street to the Italian joint because we wanted real food instead of a frikkin crackers and crappy lunch meat.  This is good for the whole Ed-Hardy-40-something-year-old-popped-collar crowd and their 22 year year-old consorts to meet up from their ads on Craigslist; but otherwise this place is awful...which is weird because their sister business, The Windsor, is absolutely amazing.",

I think I'm going to marry him just for his taste in food and wine :)  To begin, the hostess let us know it would be a 30 minute wait. She took our name down and obviously heard me whining to him about how hungry I was... so she came back about 10 minutes later and seated us. That was incredibly sweet of her and I knew the customer service would be awesome.  So, the waitress tells us the special was bruschetta and a bottle of wine... for $20. I couldn't believe what she was saying. $20... for an entire bottle of wine AND four different selections of bruschetta? Is this real life?   Yes, yes it was... and I was in heaven. We ordered salmon, tomato & mozzarella, artichoke, and white bean (which turned out to be hummus, yay!) and I feel those are the top four in my book. We also ordered the Pinot Grigio and it was a perfect combination. For dessert, he ordered an espresso ice cream and I ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream... both to die for.   Then the bill came, and it was less than $35 altogether. So, I was a cheap date and happy to be so for this place! I can't wait to go back - 10 stars if I could!",

As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I am giving 4 stars. I am giving it four stars only because for some reason every time I go here the food just doesn't seem as fresh as the other Postinos. Also, parking is a nightmare and you are literally forced to valet.   If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good.   Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic.   Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a try of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!",

    "text": "Amazing food!   My boyfriend and I went for lunch on a Saturday after going to the art museum. I was happy to see that wines were only $5 a glass. Pitchers of beer were only $5! We got almost four glasses out of the pitcher. And it's not bad beer, either; the four choices on tap were ones I'd never heard of. Our wait was only about 20 minutes, which was fine considering that it's a small space.  It would have been nice to get the bruschetta before our entrees, as when we ordered we said \"to start,\" but all the food was delicious. You could have a light meal of just the bruschetta. The four we chose were: brie and apples with fig spread, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, warm artichoke spread, and burrata bacon arugula & tomato. The brie/apple/fig spread was by far my favorite-- such a neat combination of flavors. My boyfriend said that the artichoke spread was some of the best he's ever had.  I only had room for half my giant panini after eating the bruschetta, but it made great leftovers. My panini, the Nine Iron, had chicken, arugula, dijonnaise, tomasto, thick bacon, and mozarella. High stacked and wonderful. My boyfriend got a panini with roast beef and onions, and he enjoyed it.  The service was the downside-- the waitress came over once when we first arrived and we asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu, but 10 or 15 minutes later we were still sitting there waiting for her to return, and it's not a big restaurant. Luckily another employee (maybe a manager?) noticed us waiting and took our order, and apologized for our wait. The hostess was also really nice, asking us where we were from and what we liked to eat.   The vibe is hipster and laid-back. Most customers seemed to be 30 and under, but there were a few middle-aged couples. Would go back if I'm in Phoenix again.",

    "text": "One more five-star review for Postino Central. I have been to the original Postino and, of course, love it for its cute setting, interesting selection of beers and wines, and great prices! The only real difference between the Central and Arcadia locations is the same as the difference between Central and Arcadia....both are yuppie, but Central slightly less so. Also, of course, Central has a slightly more 'urban' vibe. Bottom line, if you are a yelper, you will probably like both Postinos, but you will LOVE Postino Central!",

I love all the bruschettas, but my 4 go-to are the white bean, fig/prosciutto, tomato jam, and mozzarella/basil. Beware: Mon/Tues are packed right around 8. You're better off going around 9-9:30. The sandwiches here are also tasty. I've had the autostrada and tuna. The tuna is so good that my tuna-hating mom is the one who recommended it! You can also do half sandwich/salad. The mixed greens salad is great, but the Italian Picnic is my favorite! And not just because it has delicious bacon, but it does help. If wine isn't your thing, they have 4 beers on tap and more in bottles. And during happy hour (11-5 every day), pitchers are $5. It's not a huge pitcher, but enough to get 3 beers out of it. Glasses of wine are also $5 during happy hour.",

    "text": "I wish there was a Postino close to us because our area could use one!  Everything was fantastic.  Upon entering, the flow of the place is on point.  It has a modern open-air feel with the back wall open to the patio diners.  We decided to sit at the bar.  It was about 2pm on a Saturday and the place was buzzing.  Had great vibes for sure.  We ordered some wine along with the Bruschetta board.  If you have a chance to go here you cannot pass up the Salmon Bruschetta with pesto and capers...TO DIE FOR!  The staff was energetic which I like.  I hate seeing miserable restaurant staff that move slowly and look like they hate their job.  That was not the case at Postino.  We also had a salad but I don't recall the name.  It had candied walnuts, blue cheese and grapes I think and it was also very good.  Can't beat the price either.  Give me a great atmosphere, tasty food made with fresh, high quality ingredients, good drinks AND be kind to my wallet then I'm yours!  Glad we tried it.  My fiance is still talking about it a week later.  Next time we are in Phoenix we will definitely be back.",

I have no idea, it must have been a rip in the space/time continuum. That's the most obvious answer to me, anyway.  If you haven't eaten at a Postino's, I mean seriously, what are you waiting for? An invitiation? Well if that's it.. then here. I cordially invite you to dine at Postino's.  The service leaves a little something to be desired- like a server pouring my wine. All they did was open the bottle and then set it back on the table for us to pour out ourselves. We even opened one of the two bottles of Prosecco we ordered. To me, that's absolutely ridiculous. This is a wine bar, if I wanted to serve myself, I would go to Total Wine and take that shiz home with me.   But whatever, it was still a blast and the bruschetta were delicious. I will definitely come back. Many times.",

    "text": "An incredible meal!  This is a great space, dark and romantic, but still fun and engaging.  Great music, lovely wines and delicious bites.  Waitress was knowledgeable on the wine list and I went with her recommendation: Cambridge Cabernet.  Yummy!!!  Ended up having two glasses!  After ordering what seemed like the obvious first choice, bruschetta to share, we decided none of the sandwiches or salads were calling out to us.  So, we decided to order \"snacks\" and ordered both their pretzel board and meat/cheese board.  Great decision!!  We really enjoyed our bruschetta choices: brie & apples with fig spread, warm artichoke spread, roasted peppers with goat cheese, and salami with pesto.  They were all delicious but I really enjoyed the roasted peppers and goat cheese the most.  It was the perfect blend of tangy and savory.  Those bruschettas were no joke either- 4 very large pieces of bread, sliced into 4ths- perfect for sharing!!  The butcher's block and pub board were both delicious!!  Perfect for sharing, perfect for getting a little bit of everything: meat, cheese, bread, olives, dried fruit, pickles and corn nuts.  There wasn't anything on either board we didn't like.  It did end up being a bit too much food to finish everything though (sorry hummus and fancy pickles.)   All in all, we spent more than 2 hours here.  We never felt rushed, server was attentive but not intrusive and we had a wonderful time talking and eating.  I would highly recommend this place for a girl's night out, or a date.",

It reminds me of an open-air Spanish tapas bar with a Cali twist.   Every year that I come to town for Spring Training, I make a beeline for Postinos and breathe a sigh of elation as my vacation begins with the first clink of my Bellini filled glass to the lucky individual I have decided to share this amazing experience with.  I can now say I have tried almost every bruschetta combination (there were 11 at last count) and j'adore the prosciutto as well as the white bean.   Soup of the moment makes me wish the moment would never end (corn chowder, rave reviews).  Panini sandwiches - whenever I can bear to part with my bruschetta these really are amazing sandwiches with unique flavor combinations.   Tip: don't be afraid to try something that sounds scary or really odd as a flavor combo. The combinations that I was thinking sounded the worst ended up being my favorites!!",

We shared a glass of the carminere/cabernet blend since it was before 8, and then upon our server's recommendation, opted for a bottle of the ganacha when the time struck.  Good choice!  Get there early because it tends to get packed.  We got there around 6:45, and by 8, there were people waiting outside for a table.  They waited a long time.

    "text": "This past weekend, I finally had a chance to try the brunch at Postino on Central. I went as part of Smunch, my monthly brunch meetup. I was really looking forward to this, as the reviews I'd read were glowing, and Postino did not disappoint!  I started brunch with a delightful peach bellini, and my wife and I shared an order of walnut toast with brie and fresh berry compote. The berries and brie were a fantastic combination and the bread was yummy, toasted lightly to add a bit of crunch.  I had the French toast, which I'd heard from Georgie S. was good enough to bathe in. It lived up to its reputation, as it was warm and soft inside without being too well done on the outside. It was served with creme fraiche, berry compote and sliced strawberries. It was an altogether delightful take on a breakfast classic.  Finally, I finished the morning with a glass of honey cucumber lemonade and a cup of coffee. The lemonade was absolutely wonderful, light and refreshing. I'm sure it's magic during the hot summer months, but even with the winter weather I found it enjoyable. The coffee is from Lola Coffee a local coffeehouse and roaster. It was slightly more bitter than I prefer, but I accept that I'm an unrepentant coffee snob, so I rate it as perfectly acceptable for a restaurant setting.  Finally, I have to commend Postino for handling the 30+ Smunch attendees very well. Troy (the manager) had set up four tables, but the group quickly expanded to seven. The staff, especially our excellent server Jenny handled everything with grace and a smile. I was also impressed that the kitchen staff was able to turn out so many simultaneous orders while keeping the quality high.  The only problem was with figuring out the bill. Instead of doing separate checks or checks per table, we had three or four checks which each contained the orders for several people, but we weren't sure whose was whose. In the end, we got it handled, and since this was a special situation, I didn't feel that it should take away from the five stars I feel Postino deserves.  Overall, Postino brunch is a resounding success!",

    "text": "I've been to Postino Central about five times in the last two months.  The atmosphere is a cute little restaurant with large tables for groups and outdoor seating as well. I have gone with small groups of 3-4 and larger groups of 9+, and we are seated within a reasonable amount of time. The outdoor seating can get a bit warm in hotter months, though.  The parking is complimentary (complimentary + tip, actually), so make sure you have some cash on hand, or the Light Rail is just about a block away or less.   The wine selection is nice, although I haven't seen a Chianti on the menu. They also carry hard-to-find beers, such as my favorite, Duval and Raspberry Framboise.  The bruschetta is delicious, and there are interesting choices, such as white bean/tomato/basil and fig/apple/cheese, quite tasty!  Update: Since I wrote this, about 4-5 trips later, again, wow, I'm so impressed with this place. In October, a friend came to visit and we had a party of 15 on a Saturday night. I made reservations, but they had the table ready to go by 6:55 pm and didn't mind that just three of us sat down while waiting for the others. The servers were quite attentive, and I've never had to wait. I recently brought my mom last week, and she described the food as \"delicious,\" and today took part in the 3-5pm $5 happy hour, delish!  Another perk - it's so chill. I noticed many people wearing jeans or shorts at Postino today, yet some people dress up.  The only thing that can be annoying - if you can't find parking or if the valets are done for the day, be careful about where you park in the street. I've had friends who got tickets.",

The bartenders here are really sweet, and make sure that you are good to drive home before you leave.  For the record...I slur my speech after a few glasses of wine, I wasn't really that drunk.  They still have the amazing wine selection, absolutely delicious bruschetta (get the tomato jam and goat cheese, heavenly!), and great soups and salads.  And of course the paninis are a godsend.  Though this one is a little farther, I think I will frequent it more often because of the bigger space and bigger bar.",

It has been a blast every time thanks to the people I am with. Maybe we're too dysfunctional to get quick service, but it usually seems to take longer than you would expect. We aren't ever in a hurry though so its never a been a big deal. Im not sure which bruschetta is my favorite, but it's definitely the ones with meat! Forget the vegetarian options IMO.",

Also, my bruschetta suggestions are:  Tuscan Tuna, Warm Artichoke Spread, Roasted Peppers & Goat Cheese, and Brie & Apples.  I'm a pretty big fan of this place, but am glad that I can have a boozy brunch here when I feel it necessary, now.",

We tried during a the weekend and the parking lot was so packed we couldn't find a spot so we left but we figured it was that good and came another time.   We shared The Bounty and Bruchetta which was plenty. The Bounty includes...grilled cauliflower, asparagus, and a variety of vegetables served with Guindilla peppers, spicy Marcona almonds, herb cucumber cream dipping sauce and smoked almond hummus. So very delicious with lots of different textures, flavors and methods of cooking.  It was so hard to choose from all the choices of the Brushetta but we chose the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Salami with Pesto and a seasonal choice that had mushrooms and they were all so incredibly good.   This would be my lunch and dinner every day...i just loved eating like this with so many varieties and choices. They had a $5 wine special where you get a couple glasses worth and there are many choices. I think you can also get a pitcher of beer for the same price.  Staff is great and owner/manager came by to check on us which was awesome...we will definitely be back...I think of this place often! :)",

We had a selection of sorts for their bruschetta board which included the following: Mascarpone & Fig & pistachio, Buffalo mozzarella and tomato (wish it had basil on it & balsamic), Salmon w/pesto, onions and capers (ridiculously good), can't recall the last one but it was fantastic (had bacon pieces in it). We also tried for dessert: Salted Caramel sundae & Chocolate lava cake w/icecream (personally it needs more icecream because the lava cake is so rich/dark you need more sweetness to it) otherwise it was great. Service was good although we had several servers come to the table and we weren't 100% sure who was taking care of us. Also, we asked for a couple of things a few times and had to ask more than once but overall it was a nice experience. We'll be back for more wine and small bites in the future.",

In the past the food has been good so that's why they get 2 stars.  The waiter pushed a bottle of wine on our table of 7 and brought us one pitcher (2 beers). After coming by to refill waters two in our group asked for another beer. We were cut off. Bottle of wine was still half full. To give you an idea, this was 1pm on a Saturday and our total tab was $65. For 7 people.   I certainly understand a business has the right to use their best judgment. We even called to asked what exactly we did--were we too loud, did people complain etc.--and were told that it was company policy after a few bottles of wine. Huh? Our wine bottle was half full (which we didn't really want) and only had 1 pitcher. I mentioned this and the person on the phone said, \"I don't know.\"  They made sure we were cut off at Joy Ride as well. Our group is a rowdy one, and we've indeed been rightfully kicked out of bars but usually we know exactly what we did wrong. This place has us baffled. Not sure what we did other than being loud and cheers-ing a lot. So long story long, I'd skip this place if you've got a group larger than 4.",

The low lighting and candles make the ambiance here very intimate and romantic. I enjoyed the Stagecoach pinot noir. We ordered bruschetta first but the kitchen had lost the ticket. So we received our entrees with confusion. I asked where our bruschetta was and they told me about the confusion and let us know that they would bring them out and they would be paid for by the house. Great customer service.   I ordered the raspberry chicken salad. The mixed greens came with balsamic vinaigrette and had gorgonzola and pecans. The chicken salad was on the side mixed with green apples. Delicious and light. Everything I wanted out of the dish was present. The bruschetta came and I really enjoyed the apple and brie! It's sweet and the apple gives it some tang.   For dessert, I ordered creme Brulee. I would have liked maybe some fruit but it was good anyway.   I really enjoyed our visit here. Thanks for the superior customer service and great drinks and food. Cheers to next time.",

My friends and I often like to split one bruchetta board, and then each get a sandwich. Through our various visits we have tried almost all the bruschetta and we have loved them all. However, I am always consistent when it comes to the sandwich. I get an Autostrada with pesto instead of the sauce on it and the side pine nut salad. I LOVE the side pine nut salad. It is simple but so good and a nice complement for the rest of the meal. I highly recommend going to Postinos or any of its sister restaurants (Upward Projects is the restaurant group that runs them).",

I don't even like Italian food, and yet this is my favorite spot! The atmosphere is nice, the portions are great, the prices are good, and the food is indescribable!!! Once you try their bruschetta, you'll never want to order it from another restaurant. It doesn't matter which one you order because they are all sooooooo delicious. My favorites are the apple and brie, artichoke, salmon with pesto, pistachio and dates, tomato jam, and...awww, forget it! I love 'em all! I've had the nine iron panini, grilled cheese, chicken panini, turkey panini, and tuna panini. ALL of them were the best of their kind. Literally better than anywhere I've ever been. My husband is the pickiest person on the planet, and even he loves Postino. Their creme brulee was scrumptious also. I even went for breakfast one time, and that was also a treat. I've tried 4 different salads from Postino and alllll of them were INCREDIBLE. My favorite one is the one with grapes in it. I'm telling you, you can't go wrong with this restaurant. It'll change your life:-). I live in Glendale, but I make sure to pay my favorite restaurant a visit at least once a month, but usually more than that.",

This time we were served primarily by David (who's helped us in the past) and we were so happy to see him. Highly recommend the butchers block for meat and cheese lovers. Can never go wrong with a bottle of wine with good company and the killer music they play. I added 3 news songs to my playlist within our hour visit because it's that good! They also just added to their menu so if you don't like the usual charcuterie board have no fear they have you covered with olive plates, grilled cheese, soups, salads, paninis and more.",

We got the bruschette board of course. I would def get the Fresh Mozzarella w/ Tomato & Basil and the Proscuitto w/ Figs & Mascarpone again! The warm artichoke spread was good as well but I would be willing to give that up to try another flavor. Our last selection was the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread which was too sweet for my liking on a bruschetta (and I LOVE my sweets). We also split a Raspberry Chicken Salad which was THE BEST chicken salad I have ever had. They also give you the vinaigrette on the side so you can flavor it to your liking. Last but not least we got the Chocolate Bouchon with vanilla bean ice cream to share. This dessert is SO GOOD we each would've gotten one of our own on a greedy day, but luckily we didn't or our pant buttons would've popped.    The service here is amazing. Our waters were constantly refilled. Our waitress even gave us reward cards to sign up for. Free bruschetta for signing up and dessert on your birthday! Can't argue with that :)",

The parking was tight, but not terrible.  I went to that location for the first time last week, and it was exactly what I was in the mood for.  It was full of people, but not noisy, with lots of Imogen Heap and Postal Service playing at the right volume.  My one glass of Sangiovese was tasty til the very end.  The bruschetta (on MJ bread, they tell me) was fantastic, and went perfectly with the Italian picnic salad that we split.  I debated between four and five stars, and decided on five because I couldn't think of anything they did wrong.  I don't know if I'd go there if I were really hungry and wanted a full dinner, but for a light meal and a glass of wine, it was just right.",

I have also had the pretzel,cheese,corn nuts, and chorizo appetizer which was really good also. Last time I tried the cucumber/lemonade which while different was really tasty and refreshing.  The service I have had was excellent and while most breakfast places do good food but don't have much of a dine in experience this one is nice and open and beautiful.

Been there many, many times for lunch in, lunch to go, happy hour, brunch on Sundays, some wine on a lazy afternoon... and one thing this place has in common for all of those occasions:  it's always, always busy!   Does that tell you anything?   One point is deducted because I really dislike the service system they have.  I know it has it's advantages - everyone working there is responsible for everything... so you're never ignored or told \"sorry, this isn't my table.\"    They pool their tips.   I know, I know... this has its advantages.  But the big disadvantage, in my opinion, is that you never develop a personal relationship with your server.   Perhaps this is a silly gripe, but it's the way I feel.   (And, way back in the stone age, I was a waitress for 10 years so I really like getting to know my server on a personal level; you just can't with this system.)   Okay enough on that.   +4 stars is all about the food, the atmosphere and the great deals.   You gotta love the awesome bruschetta selection; the fabulous salads; the many variations of panini, which you can halve and get with a small salad or soup... everything is just really great.     The patio is awesome too - and they have it set up with misters for the hot days and a fireplace and portable heaters for the chilly days so there's only about 4 weeks in the entire year where you'll find it sparsely populated!",

So due to the fact the pizza place was closed, I went in for dinner my date had the side salad with a glass of wine...and I had a bowl of soup of the day along with the turkey sandwich and some organic chips.  The food and service was perfect along with the ambiance of the location, it was quiet there were only 5 or 6 people in the whole place besides the staff.  We split one of the Tammie's cakes for desert..and my date almost died of sugar overload...she explained that sex that evening would not be necessary due to the chocolate desert that she had just consumed. Not sure if that was a good thing or not...:(  This place was perfect it gets better every time I go there. A must stop visit if you are on central in Phoenix.

    "text": "So I went here on Tuesday night to take advantage of the 20$ for bruschetta and a bottle of wine. I went with the BF and two friends. I was so excited to try this place as I have heard such great things about it. We got there at 8:10 and were told that there would be a 30 min wait. No big deal. So they brought us out some wine from one of our bottles (pinot grigio) and it was good. The lady who was bringing wine out to the parking lot was also very sweet. So we went through just about the entire bottle and still no table. We waited and waited.... Eventually we got tired and sat on the ground for a couple minutes before someone came and said we couldn't sit on the ground and we should sit on the couches... but they were full of other people. Lame. So finally, about an hour and a half after we got there we got a table. Really? Ridiculous. Then once we were seated no one came to take our order or bring water or anything for another 10 minutes. At this point I really hated this place. We were all really annoyed. So finally some guy came over to talk to us. We asked for the remainder of our pinot grigio (like one glass) and a bottle of riesling. Well the pinot was all warm... they hadn't kept it cool. Yuck. However, the riesling was delicious! one of the best rieslings I have ever had, and I enjoy me some riesling. We also got the two bruschetta boards to go with our bottles. The BF and I got salami and pesto, mozz tom and basil, burrata bacon and arugula, and apple brie and fig jam. Holy. Crap. I wanted to hate it. Badly. I was in such a bad mood. But it was wonderful. Damn you Postino! The brie and fig jam was so beautiful... creamy and sweet. The burrata and bacon was amazing.... and I don't like bacon. Our friends got some of the same as us and a salmon one... they really liked the salmon, but that's not my bag. So anyway, I loved it... but the service was so bad that I can't give it more than 3 stars. I guess the worst part was that they didn't try to make it right at all. They told us 30 min and it was 1.5 hours... they should have comp'd something or given us dessert or something, but no. So it makes me question if I would come back.... even though the food was so good. I mean, our friends had to get up at 5 am to go to work in the morning, so leaving dinner at 11 pm was not so great. So if you have nothing better to do.... go wait for a table here.",

We must have gotten there at the perfect time, 11 a.m., as there was no wait and we were seated quickly. When we left around 11:45 the line to be seated was insanely long.   The food was great! I had the cibatta french toast with a side of bacon and a Bellini to wash it all down. The french toast was just lovely. I generally don't order french toast because its usually to soggy, but not at Postino's! It was a slice of french toast heaven with a super tasty creme sauce and fresh sliced strawberry on top. The bacon was decent, but no Matt's Big Breakfast type of goodness.   Our waitress was on top of things even as the place filled up, our glasses of iced tea never got empty.   We will for sure be checking this place out again!",

The bruschetta with the ricotta and pistachios is amazing.  It's a great place to meet friends and hang out.   So why only three stars...Well consistency is what makes a place great.  The service and food should be good if you are there on a Monday night when the place is empty as on a Friday night when there is a line out the door.  I was at Postino last Friday night and it was a train wreck.  The waitress couldn't get the order straight and when the food finally came it was horrible.  How can the same dish ordered on a Monday night (the bruschetta with ricotta) taste and look so radically different on a Friday night???  There are some service issues that need to be worked out...I'll be back, but not on the weekend.  Now when I drive by and see a lot of people in the parking lot I keep on driving.",

Soups of the moment (they change all the time) have never let me down either.  And their salads are really tasty.  Portions are big - even salads - so splitting makes sense - and they are really great here and split things on separate plates for you.  Love the wine selection - this place got me hooked on Tempranillo.  Place has a hipster vibe but really chill and the staff is super friendly.",

    "text": "Food: Ordered a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine. Their \"Board & Bottle for $20\" deal on Monday and Tuesday nights (8pm-close) is a great deal and perfect for a simple  and inexpensive date night. The board of bruschetta comes with your choice of 4 different combinations for you to pick from. We had the brie & apples with fig spread. This is a simple and common combination, matching brie with a light fruit. Almost a \"dessert\" because of how sweet and light it is. The warm artichoke spread was simple, and was essentially and artichoke dip spread on a piece of bread. It was still good though, and nice and warm. The ricotta with dates and pistachios is my personal favorite. It's a great flavor combination and something I order every time I go. We also ordered the red pepper and goat cheese bruschetta. Goat cheese goes well with so many vegetables, and this was no exception. To go with our board of bruschetta we ordered a bottle of the Chasing Lions, which is a cab-merlot blend. It was smooth and a very dynamic wine. I enjoyed it. Definitely a wine I would look for at Total Wine or BevMo! to have on hand at the house.  Service: The service was pretty good. We arrived at about 7:45 for their 8:00pm special. We were able to sit down immediately and our waitress brought us water and a small plate of olives. We told her we knew we were early for the special, and at a little after 7:50 she told us it was \"close enough\" and we could order for the special. Simple gestures like that are really great and help make a restaurant's staff shine. The seats that we were in were right under a speaker (the music was sort of loud) and it was hard to talk. We asked if we could move to the bar and she gladly moved us a few feet away to where we wanted. Sitting at the bar, we noticed that they had wine on tap. They are the first place in Arizona to do this, and I have seen it become a trend in San Francisco. The bartender gladly poured us a sample of the wine. It was nice to see them willing to share and give a sample of a new product to entice their customers. It was pretty good, too!  Ambiance: The ambiance as far as architecture and structure is very similar to the original Postino in Arcadia, along with La Grande Orange and Liberty Market. There are exposed trusses, and brick walls that add some flair and history to the building. I love that the space occupies an old bank and they utilize some of the existing structure for their design. I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the noise level. I understand that it is a wineBAR but the music was abnormally loud, and didn't need to be with the amount of people and conversation going on in the building. Definitely a hip and trendy place for young 20 somethings to be, and spotted plenty of people that were easily in their 50's.",

I have never been disappointed with quality of their product. I love the building and will continue to go back.",

I planned on getting some bruschetta but by the time we finished our butcher's block and cheese appetizers we were stuffed. The food was amazing- I could just eat the artichoke spread with a spoon- and the $5 wine deal was fabulous.  Our water glasses were never more than half empty and when we wanted to move onto the patio our server held a table. We got desserts and the salted caramel was almost better than....well... that. Because it was our first visit they comped one of our desserts.  Really cool vibe, attentive staff, great food. Can't wait to go back and finally get that bruschetta.",

From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.  Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!  Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!",

I ended up splitting the bill with a girlfriend since neither of us could finish 4 bruschettas by ourselves. The food was good, a little bit on the salty side, but it had flavor and great presentation. The service was excellent and the staff really makes sure their customers are satisfied. The atmosphere was sort of a mix between an underground hangout meets a trendy italian restaurant. The culture was very hip, making for a great environment for good food, and good coversation with a group of friends. I would definitely reccommend this spot to anyone looking for something a little different and unique the next time they decide to go out and eat.I know I'll be returning some time soon.",

I love sweetish/savory combos and the rich, creamy mascarpone was the perfect compliment. Warm artichoke- good salami and pesto- really good, simple. I really like their pesto tomato, basil, mozzarella- really nice, classic. The sea salt very complimentary, gives a pop of flavor  I ordered the autostata panini on focaccia.

Opted for the Zin and Syrah from that list, but wasn't too happy with the Zin - it fell a little flat. The Syrah was a bit bolder and more structured.  They also have my La Spinetta Moscato d'Asti!  I love their bruschettas, salads and desserts. They have a few locations which makes it very convenient to cure my wine fix.",

The food; bruschetta, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, bell peppers with goat cheese..... well really all of it was super tasty. Nice wine selection, the ambiance is casual and yet it can be pretty romantic. At the time I was dating my now Wife, we came here a couple of times and it set the mood just right. *High Five!*... check it out at least once.",

Their food is at par with California cuisine even though it is in Arizona.  We definitely will be coming back here again whenever we visit our friends.

With no wind and adequate cover, the rain actually made for a pretty decent ambiance; still had the chance to enjoy the beautiful patio space in cool weather. Started off with a Butcher's Block. Solid. I went for the prosciutto with brie and fig jam on focaccia and it was easily one of the most solid sandwiches I've eaten. In typical brunch fashion, had a mimosa but switched gears soon after to grab a pitcher of Firestone myself. Was not disappointed. Overall, the food at Postino was super solid but I was more so sold on the great feel of the place.",

I have yet to have a bad suggested paring.  The apple/fig/brie and artichoke are my fav. Hands down. The dinners are almost an after thoughts, and usually by the time I finish my first glass and split an order of bruschetta, I can't finish it anyways, so expect to ask for a to go bag if your order anything more than a cup of soup. It gets busy, so be prepared for a wait on the weekends, but once you get in, the service is quick and attentive.",

Excellent wait staff!  Now, on to the food...and wine.. Yummy! The bruschetta board is definitely the best selection in the valley, and one of the best buys at that! $13.50, and you get to choose 4 types of awesome bruschetta. My personal favorites are the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, as well as the brie and apples. With that said, they ALL are wonderful. And if you make it in later (after 8pm) on a Monday and Tuesday, you get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine all for $20!  OH! Postino's also has a small, but great, selection of salad and sandwiches to choose from if you aren't in the mood for bruschetta.   Postino Central is a great place that is certainly worth a try!

    "text": "Postino, why are you the best? Oh? You can't speak bc you're a restaurant? That's cool, man, I will tell everyone for you.   Postino rules for a number of reasons but lemme lay a few down on you really quickly. One of my favorite things about Postino is the intimate atmosphere. when I say intimate, I don't mean that like tables are weirdly close to one another or anything. I mean that the lighting and the seating and the ambiance just lends itself to making you feel comfortable and close with your pals, whether you're on a legit date, a weird is it or is it not a date date, or if you're with actual friends that you dig in a platonic manner.   Another one of my fave parts of Postino is the....BRUSCHETTA BOARDS! (Insert club music here) Seriously those bad boys are da shit. $14 for four different types of bruschetta  (you can mix and match or do multiple pieces of the same thing) and man is it worth every penny. I love the tomato jam and sheep's milk cheese; however, I am usually flying solo on that sheep's milk cheese vibe. It's okay though. More for me and I just chalk it up to my friends being lamey lamertons who can't handle the tang of dat sheep milk.  On this most recent trip, my bf and I split a bowl of the soup of the moment, which was white bean chili w/chicken. It was tasty and served with crusty bread so yummy. Duh. We also got two bruschetta boards to split between me, him, and my other friend who joined us. They usually go buck wild on the bacon and arrugala bruschetta, which I can't vibe with on account of the whole no pork thing, but they seem to love it. We also got some of the mozzarella and tomato, the salmon with pesto, and the seasonal, which was ricotta, butternut squash, and a drizzle of pumpkin seed oil. Love tomato mozz but I always wish it had a drizzle of balsamic glaze or something. Bf dug the salmon and he surprisingly liked the seasonal one as well. Cheeses on everything were creamy and very flavorful.   On this particular visit, I felt severely bad for the servers bc while the place is open until midnight,  the kitchen closes at 11. They had sooo many groups walk in right before this and want to order food. They even had a couple who was seated at 10:59 (I checked bc I felt for my homegirl server) and basically demand to be fed. Like for real? You were told when you walked in when the kitchen closed and made the decision to stay and then still had the audacity to say GIMME DEM BRUSCHETTA BOARDS!? Uncool, guys, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fun.cool&s=6c85c6fb531a10605f790cfe8200fccf60822e7d2e63589e0099a99845498cce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">un.cool</a>.  Sooo to sum up this review which kind of went off the tracks there, great food, great service (albeit a little hipster-dressed), and great atmosphere.",

One of the managers there, Mark (guy with a great beard), I can't speak highly enough of. Not only a great employee but a nice person as well.  I've only ever had the bruschetta there as I'm not much of a drinker AND eater, I like to pin myself to one activity at a time. At Postino, it usually pertains to wine. Tons and tons of wine. If that's your thing this place easily has one of the most thoughtfully curated selections in the state.  If that's not your thing, well, go to one of the other restaurants like Joyride or Windsor or Federal Pizza (owned by the same development group) and enjoy the different cuisine there. Either way, have fun in this little mid-town gem.",

    "text": "We had a fabulous lunch here last Saturday. Perhaps it just happened to be the perfect combination of circumstance and mood, but our meal really hit the spot. After finishing a hike, we were ready to relax and enjoy a nice meal. We shared a roast beef sandwich, a red pepper and gouda soup, and a side of the mixed greens salad. The salad was quite possibly the best I have ever had. It had the perfect amount of salad dressing (I don't like it when it's drenched) and it had the perfect amount of stuff in it - amazing! We also had Mimosas (made with fresh squeezed orange juice!) and ended with the Chocolate Bouchon. If I lived in Phoenix, I would be here all the time!",

So far so good. Ohh my recommendation would be that maybe they should consider extending their happy hour an hour or two!",

    "text": "Yet another hit from the LGO Group. I've never been to the Postino in the Arcadia neighborhood but wanted to try this one for lunch since it's near my work. They have a great location on Central Ave. and the decor is simple but stylish. The lunch crowd was very eclectic, but I assume the place skews a little younger and more happening for the nighttime scene. Although it's called \"Postino Winecafe,\" don't let the name fool you into thinking food comes second. I absolutely LOVE the bruschetta, with about 8 different options of topping. For $12.75, you get to pick four, and it's enough for an appetizer for 2-4 or an entree for one. We went with the apple and brie, smoked salmon, roasted red peppers and goat cheese, and ricotta cheese with pistachios and dates. All of them were super tasty, but the apple and brie was a standout. We also shared the prosciutto panini, with brie and fig jam on focaccia bread...so delicious! This is a great hangout for the young urban CenPho crowd, and come fall that big patio will be packed!",

As its a great place to gather with friends in my neighborhood, the food is fantastic, and I am a \"take out\" regular. I absolutely adore the prosciutto and brie panini on focaccia bread (it is loaded up with figs and arugula) with their mixed greens salad. They do have a take out parking spot now, which comes in quite handy.   If you are there with a large group, order the bruschetta. There is usually plenty to go around.   They have a decent wine list, I tend to stick to red's. Listen to your server, they will not steer you wrong. I've been able to make it out on a Sunday for their $5 glass before 5pm.   Atmosphere is fun. If you haven't been there yet- you should!",

Or why did it take so long KFC to come up with grilled chicken? Or why, why did it take so long for The Ghost Whisperer to be canceled? I ask you. Why? WHYYYY!!  Putting that aside I have to say I was UBER impressed with Postino's on every level. I triple love the bar opening up to the intimate patio, the charming, airy and open dining room with the fireplace and cozy vintage sofas. Love it.   Now let's talk BRUSCHETTA 101! OK. They have nailed it. Nailed it like Levi Johnston nailed Bristol Palin! My faves were the brie and apple and the ricotta with pistachios and dates. The bread is perfectly crunchy on the edge with a soft middle. Kind of like my Uncle Larry but don't tell him I said that.   We over ordered because we definitely didn't each need our own sandwich. The Niner (I think that's the name) was gigantic and served on delicious focaccia bread...crispy bacon, juicy chicken...so so good. Side salad was, um, interesting. While I appreciate the pine nuts and the cheese I just wasn't feeling the dressing. Kind of sour.   Not to worry. Nothing could spoil this fabulous foodie rampage. Service, at first a tad slow...was friendly and efficient.   It won't take me long to return to you Postino's. I want to be a regular so that when I walk in everyone yells THOMAS!!!",

    "text": "I've been here twice. I'll be upfront and tell you that my review might be \"tainted\" because both times I ate at Postino's I was able to order anything I wanted and I did not have to pay for it.   Each time, I ordered a bruschetta board for myself. So yes, you might find me gluttonous, but I don't regret it for a single moment. The bruschetta are unique with their toppings and every bite is worth savoring for minutes because each mouthful is so delicious. I prefer the savory toppings (no pears, apples or figs for me), and I love all of the different combination possibilities. I think my favorite is either the warm artichoke spread or roasted peppers with goat cheese. Or maybe it's the Tomato jam & fresh sheep's milk cheese? Smoked salmon with pesto was also tasty...and let us not forget the burrata, bacon, arugula & tomatoes...although that one is probably the messiest to eat. Not that I care. I'll get messy if it means all the food is making it to my mouth.  I also ordered the Italian Picnic Salad. 1) I love golden beets. 2) I love goat cheese. 3) The salad also includes walnuts and bacon. Add these things together and we're talking about a good salad.   The most recent time that I was at Postino's, I auspiciously ordered myself a bottle of wine, forgetting -for the moment- that I needed to leave two hours later. I only drank half the bottle, and started to advertise its availability to my co-workers. Thankfully, the waitress heard me, and informed me that I could just take the bottle home. And so I did.",

The service was the worst I've ever experienced--it was like our entire table was under an Invisibility Cloak! It took an hour after we finished our appetizers (and long after our glasses were empty) before our server came back to take our orders, and then another hour before we had our food.  Every drink refill happened at least 20 minutes after glasses were empty.  And can we talk about the ONE unisex restroom?  You walk in and see a urinal next to the sink, and then a toilet.  You turn to close the door and realize that it is frosted glass--i.e. not completely opaque.

Lastly, what is up with 60% of the menu items involving goat cheese? Do you get a bulk deal or something?  I was hard pressed to find a dish to order that did not contain goat cheese.  Also, fair warning: the parking situation, even with valets, is dire.  I would absolutely not go to this restaurant again.  The food and the ambiance just couldn't outweigh how bad the service was and how grossed out I was by the bathroom.",

I am required to give at least one star. The second star was because the food was actually very good.  You most definitely did not earn two stars.  When I come to your establishment, it is not your place to determine that my not ordering something gives you license to treat me and my party like shit.  Water was spilled on one of our group by one of the servers, and no offer was made to get a napkin, or help clean it up.  Our actual server, who was adorned with diamond studs in her chest, gave the very distinct impression that everything she was doing for us was a chore.  At the end of the meal, when I asked her to separate the checks, she nearly had a conniption. Excuse me for asking you to do your job, and not make assumptions about me or my party, simply because we aren't all falling over ourselves to buy each other's meal.  I had the Nine Iron panini. It was pretty tasty. I had it with the salad, which was also delicious.  Neither, individually or collectively, could have been good enough to overcome the deplorable treatment we received.  Perhaps the fact that I wear a cowboy hat and boots is what gave the waitress the idea she had license to be an unreasonable bitch.  Perhaps it's that we (our group) doesn't fit the wine-snob, or urban hipster stereotype.  Regardless, you lost a potential regular. Nicely done.",

The bruschetta is fantastic, the wine selection is plenty, and I've never had anything here that I haven't at the very minimum liked. On Mondays and Tuesdays you can do a board of bruschetta and a bottle (yep, bottle) of wine for 20.00. You can find me and my bestie here every Monday unless someone died or T. Swift is in town. We've been known to even come back-to-back, it's that good. The patio ambiance is amazing with soft music and twinkly lights. I've never had back service here, in fact they will offer you a bottle of wine while you wait for your table. Yes, as the other reviews have stated the parking can be tough to find especially during the week, but there's a huge lot across the street that is owned by Upward Projects (parent company) so usually you can snag a spot. Beware, the wait does get long on Mondays and Tuesdays due to the amazing wine deal, but it's well worth it.",

With either location, we've always asked ourselves, \"why didn't we think about opening a restaurant that just puts tasty things on bread and charge well for it?\"  let's face it...what Postino does is not rocket science.  Great composed salads, wonderful panini and bruschetta. but, there's no hard cooking.  What there is though is creativity, style and great service.   on our last visit, we headed to Postino Central on a Wednesday night, thinking that since it was the day before St. Patrick's, no one would be out.  well, we were wrong. first, we were turned away by the valet -- \"sorry, we're full.\"  The parking lot?  the restaurant?  Where should we go?  any tips?  so, i got on the phone and called the restaurant -- \"Your valet just turned us away, are you looking for customers tonight?\"  He was cordial and stated he would go chat with the valet about finding a better way to turn down folks who needed to park their cars.    hostess was very friendly and accommodating...giving us every option for seating.  but, given the spectacular night that it was, we wanted to wait for an outdoor table.  so, we ordered some beers with the very friendly waitress that happened by, and sat in the outdoor \"waiting area\" watching the sunset.  about 1/2 hour later, we got a prime table -- in fact the same table we eat at each time we are there.   same waitress came by.  hubby ordered a second beer (i was still nursing the \"shorty\" (only $2.50!) I'd ordered before.  We selected the bella postino platter with white bean hummus and warm artichoke dip, as well as a bruschetta board of four luscious creations.  \"bus boy\" brought water and small dish of olives (okay, really small -- there were two of us and he brought 3 olives -- not 2, not 4, but 3 --yes, we arm-wrestled for the last one.)  waitress was friendly, thorough, spunky and a perfect addition to this hip, vibrant, happening place.  admittedly, we in our 40s were either parental age of the young 20 somethings gracing the place, or children of the 60+ \"second go round\" set.  bruschetta -- golly!  we had pesto with salami (great quality), burrata with arugula, bacon and tomato (there was no bacon and PLEASE do not refrigerate your tomatoes), prosciutto with fig and mascarpone (oh so incredibly good) and the \"dessert\" one -- ricotta with dates and pistachios.  after polishing off the dips and the platter of breads (there are 4 pieces to each \"slice\" of bruschetta, we were stuffed.    was intrigued by the salted caramel dessert, but there was just no room.  perhaps next time we skip the dip and save room.",

Initially we were told It would be 30 minutes.   We were a party of 3, and due to medical reasons, a member of our party couldn't sit at a high table, which we advised the host, and she said no problem.  Even though I'm sure there were people at the bar waiting, outside there were barely a handful of people. After about 45 minutes, I checked and I was informed it would another 15 minutes at least.  Fine! At one point I WAS TOLD WE\"D BE NEXT.  30 minutes went by, and no word.  I was told since we couldn't sit at a high table, there is a wait.  How could it be that 30 minutes go by, and nothing opens up after being told we were next?  Finally, a member of our party points to a couple sitting at a table that we noticed arrive about an hour after we did! I went in and I asked for the Manager.  She came out and when I pointed out the couple, she tells me, oh this is a table for 2!! Wow, really? you couldn't accommodate 3 people in almost an hour and half later by moving tables around or somehow figure it out!  Keep in mind, throughout all this time, a huge of amount of people has come and gone. Surely they weren't all sitting at a high table.  She then suggested we go to the restaurant next door, it's \"their' sister\" restaurant!  WOW! As I was talking to the Manager, a group got up and left and we were seated at their table.  Not even 30 seconds later, and group of people that showed up much later while we were waiting, was seated right after us .  To cause insult to injury, their food arrived first, even after we ordered ahead of them.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing!  I was so pissed, I couldn't even carry a conversation with my group.  The Food: We ordered Mozzarella, Tomato and basil.  I thought this was a Bruschetta.  A plate arrived, with a single tomato sliced, 2 pieces of Mozzarella stuck in between.  I was expecting a board with Bruschetta! I guess my expectation was too much.  I don't care how good the food is, after an experience like that, I would never step my foot in this so called restaurant! Their only saving grace is that the PANINI was actually pretty decent! But there is no excuse for the way we were treated, especially with a member of our party with very visible medical issue.  You would think that after an experience like this, we'd receive a complimentary appetizer or some sort of a goodwill gesture. Absolutely nothing! After raising a stink earlier, I wasn't about to say anything else! we quietly paid our bill, and left.  NEVER AGAIN!",

    "text": "This has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. I can't even count the number of times that I've been here (or the original Arcadia location) and it's consistently great!   The bruschetta is flavorful and fresh (make sure to sign up for their emails, you get a coupon for free bruschetta and they don't bombard you with spam), their salads are delicious and inventive, and I always love their \"soups of the moment.\"   The wines are a bit on the pricey side, so definitely check out their $5 glasses of wine before 5 pm. I love to go on a Saturday afternoon and get a glass (or two) of their regularly $13 sparkling Sauv. Blanc Emeri. So light and refreshing.  The service is good; it's definitely a trendy, hipster vibe but the servers are not pretentious or annoying. And their patio is dog friendly! I came in one afternoon with 3 people and 3 dogs, thinking that they would look at me like I was a crazy person and turn us away, but instead they sat us on the patio with a smile and even brought a water bowl for the pups. That's definitely the way to get a dog lover to return!   The only downside is how crowded this place is - but you can't fault it for being so awesome that everyone wants to eat there - so I try to only go at off times. If you haven't been to either Postino location yet, it's a must!",

Our second waiter spoke so softly and didn't come see if we needed anything else once our meal was delivered.   Maybe I'm just a stickler for good service considering the price of a panini, but even the panini wasn't considerably delicious. Their Raspberry salad is amazing though, I mainly go to Postino for that salad.   All in all, not a bad choice of a restaurant but not the best in the valley. Their music selections needs to be more consistent, it went from relaxing house music to hard punk in about 2 mins, kind of off setting.",

If you come here on a Monday or Tuesday after 8pm, you can get a bottle of wine and four bruschettas for $20. Total steal!!! The bruschetta board is normally $14 and I'm sure the wine is way more than $20. You'll want to plan to come a tad early because this place is always busy, even on non-$20 days.   As for the bruschetta, we had the fig and asparagus with mascarpone which was my second favorite. First fave was the salmon with capers! Salmon was perfectly smoked and melted in my mouth. Yum! Others to try that were delish, the white bean (packs a little punch), artichoke spread, Brie with apples and one with tomatoes and bacon. I'm sure we had more than this but I can't remember exactly. All I can say is this place is so good and you won't regret it!!!   Perfect place for girls night, date night or just hanging with some friends and family.

I like all of the locations, but I've been to this one most often.  I am not from Phoenix, but I travel there often for work.  Being a long time Yelper, I am always looking for a new restaurant to try and experience.  However, I put all that aside when it comes to Postino.  I MUST make a point of going there whenever I'm in town.  Let's talk bruschetta for a second.  Has anyone tried one they didn't like?  And the fact that you can pick and vary your flavors is a major bonus.  My faves are the burrata/bacon/arugula/tomato and the brie/apple/fig.   However, I love them all.  When I'm feeling not so carby, I'll get either get the cheese board or butcher's block.  Both fantastic and filling!  I haven't even mentioned the wine yet.  I am not a wine expert by any means, so I generally will ask for recommendations.  The staff is SPOT ON each time.   Everytime my wine has been so perfectly paired with what I'm eating, all the flavors are enhanced.  The prices are very affordable for what you are getting.  Plus, they have that bruschetta & wine special on Tues & Wed which is so cheap, my company is overly pleased when I turn in my expense report.    I can't forget to give props to the staff.  Everyone is perfectly helpful without being overbearing and I always see happy faces and teamwork whenever I'm there.   That's a sign of good management and a very well run place.  Kudo's to everyone at all the Postino locations!  You really know how to make a girl happy!",

The only thing I wish was a larger beer/draft menu. Coming from Michigan I'm used to more selection. We did partake of the cosmic hop ipa which was very good.   Overall I was very happy with our experience. The staff was friendly and patient as we were with friends we hadn't seen in a long time.",

    "text": "I really don't understand the hype with this place, maybe I need to try their paninis, but I've tried many of their bruschettas and a handful of their appetizers.   Where their bruschettas are concerned, the bread is thick and hard, difficult to eat and painful on the gums. The ingredients are all fresh and their mozzarella is home made but bland and tasteless, just like all their other ingredients. I found their salmon bruschetta to be one of their best, along with their olive bruschetta but both were skimpy on toppings and small for the amount you're paying for.  Unfortunately the only appetizer that sticks out to me was their capris, the tomatoes were very fresh and they did actually taste good but the mozzarella was once again bland, tasteless, and definitely nothing to write home about.  We came with a very large group, celebrating my sister's birthday, around 6PM so the place was packed. Luckily we had made reservations and were all accommodated nicely on the patio, which is quite lovely. Everyone else in the party only had praise to give on the food, especially my sister who loves the place and works at one of the farms they get many of their ingredients from (so organic and locally sourced!)   My boyfriend and I were the only ones with complaints, from how long it took to actually be served, to our glasses never being refilled. But I would suggest this place to foodie hipsters, large groups looking for small eats, or people with very bland tastes. Beware this place is impossible to find parking and the service is spotty.",

All were delicious and beautifully prepared, although I think my favorites were the prosciutto and burrata/bacon etc were my faves. I really don't think you can go wrong. The raspberry chicken salad was also really yummy and flavorful. The restaurant itself is sleek and adorable and service was friendly. Parking was sort of annoying. Would absolutely eat here again.",

I'm sure the panini's are good but WHY would you get one when you can get a bruschetta board?  We choose- Prosciutto, Figs & Mascarpone, Sweet & Spicy Pepper Jam with Goat Cheese; Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and the Seasonal. SO GOOD. I really loved the sweet & spicy pepper jam with goat cheese.  The Butcher's Block is also the star of the appetizers and SUCH a reasonable price for what you get. Our board was picked clean. Not an almond left for the mice.  This place seems to get really busy. But it's worth the wait if you love cheese and carbs and cured meats. It's a nice warm, busy, modern and trendy vibe.  Next time I'm back in Phoenix- I will make sure my friend takes me here.",

We found parking quickly (which can sometimes be a challenge at this particular location, though when it is tough, valet is available).    As we weren't incredibly hungry today, we ordered a board of bruschetta and a NYC Grilled Cheese to share.  We usually select four different selections from a long list of options but today we ordered a double serving of brie and apples with fig spread and a double serving of burrata, arugula, and tomato.  All was delicious and serving rather quickly to us.  We have never had a dish we haven't enjoyed.  In the past, we have ordered a Cheese Board, Butcher's Block, Soup & Salad, Prosciutto with Brie (swapping out the prosciutto for turkey though!), a Turkey Panini, and a variety of desserts, wines, and cider.    Two of the amazing deals that they offer are their $20 Monday & Tuesdays ($20 for a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta after 8 PM on Mondays and Tuesdays) and Happy Hour ($5 Wine by the Glass or Pitchers of Beer...including my favorite Cider, seven days a week from open until 5 PM).

On the patio is a big tree in the middle of the patio.  It is fun to go there in the evenings when the patio is all led up with lights.    Everything on the menu is always fresh and perfect.  Monday and Tuesday's they have a $20 deal after 8pm.   If would definitely want to get there early so that you get a table.  Normally the wait is about half an hour to an hour wait. You got a bottle of wine and a board of Bruschetta.    I like going there for brunch on the weekend.  You can get a whole bottle of champagne for $20 on happy hour and make them into Mimosa. My favorite dish at Postino's is on the brunch menu.  It is the farm scramble, it has Roasted Yukon Gold potatoes scrambled with fresh eggs, herbs, onions, gruyere and white cheddar served with mixed greens and tomato salad.    Everyone should at least go to Postino's once and try it out.  There are multiple ones in the valley.     Well, that is it for now.",

I can't say a bad thing about any menu items I've ordered.. and I wish they offered the creamy cauliflower soup every day because I'd be ordering takeout on my way home wayyyyy more often.

I assume that nobody makes a reservation as there is nobody awesome to talk to.  All you hear when you choose it is complete silence without anyone ever answering. I have tried time after time but the same thing all the time.  It is the same for Windsor, Joyrides Tacos, and  Federal Pizza. Will never find out how the food and service is at each of them. :)",

    "text": "Nearly a year later and Postino is the place to be to brunch, lunch and bruschetta bout' it!   Bruschetta boards are a must, but lettuce not forget about their deliciously made salads. Wine, all you want because that's what they got here and they know what's good! Not into the v? Perhaps you're into brews, no judgement - you can tap, but just so you know there's canned and bottled types too!  All puns aside -- Bruschetta boards a must-get item here and I absolutely recommend the: Fig & Marscapone, Brie & Apples, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Goat Cheese & Red Peppers. Never found a seasonal bruschetta I liked and the rest on the menu is a bit lackluster.  Salads here are perfect for you guys and gals who are sick of plain, undressed romaine lettuce sad story. Hannah's Field is a delicious salad, packed with Kale (you know that one superfood you've probably never heard of), quinoa, apple, sliced apricot, almonds, pecorino, pickled red onion and dressed in an apple cider vinaigrette. Naturally sweetened by fruit, enough fiber and substance in the Kale and quinoa to make you feel satisfied with eating your salad. You can also get protein added if you wanted.  Their Raspberry Chicken Salad is on the sweeter side mostly with the raspberry vinaigrette,  candied pecans and apple to add on top of each other's sweetness. The gorganzola is a nice touch to cut through it though.   I would pass on the NYC Grilled Cheese and Paninis here, but if you must the Nine Iron is decent. They also offer Gluten Free bread options here as well.  To get to the ETOH of it, as mentioned earlier they offer a good amount of wines on the menu with good variety and from multiple regions. I usually opt for California and French wines as I found those were more pleasing to my palate. As for beer, they have em' on tap, canned or bottled. Recently got a Ayinger Brau-Weisse Hefeweizen, delicious and a totally healthy pairing with my salad O:-)  Service and atmosphere is great. Dark and cool on the inside, lovely and spacious patio and bar out back. Staff is very knowledgeable on their items and genuinely friendly. $5 glasses of wine or pitcher of beer for HH 11am-5pm and they have a bottle of wine and bruschetta board for $20 on Mondays after 8pm. You are welcome.",

This place makes me feel important and fancy, but still has that element of contempo-casual that lets me go eat there on a Wednesday night in my sweaty yoga clothes (which I did).   The environment is relaxing, beautiful, and cozy. I love the decor and the cacti right outside of their big, clear windows overlooking the Circle K gas station. No, hear me out! Even though you're lost in what seems like a completely different city, you look out and still get the feel of eating in the middle of Central Phoenix and being completely okay with it. You love it.  I had the turkey panini and the apple/fig spread bruschetta. I was so happy to eat beautiful, lavish food that cost me hardly anything. The panini was $9.75, but it was huge and had a fresh salad next to it. The bruschetta was $14...but hey, it's flipping good bruschetta. I had absolutely no regrets, and I am definitely taking a trip there for date night right when I get the chance. It'll have you chanting om...nom nom nom.",

All the waitresses were so sweet and attentive.   The food is SO good. I didn't expect much since their menu seemed limited, but the Bruschetta Board and Butcher's Block was more than enough (and I'm a nonstop eater).  My favorite was by far the Fig & Ricotta.

Well, I passed but my friend had moved around so much that he couldn't remember his zip. It was pretty awkward for about 4 minutes when I said to just say your street address. And she finally let it go after much hesitation. It really weighed down the experience... And oddly enough she wasn't really our waitress the whole time. There was another short hair blonde server that seemed to be the main server. She was extraordinarily pleasant and checked up on us throughout the meal. In the end, the first server came back to give the check. So that was the only downside.  The food was so great! I had an artichoke dip appetizer and we ordered 4 bruschetta that are cut into four pieces. There was a goat cheese and roasted red peppers which was my favorite, this apple and fig which tasted like a delicious candy apple, this bacon one and I forgot the other one... Lol.

    "text": "I had a lovely evening catching up with friends at Postino last week. It was my first time ever going and I was excited because I had heard so many good things! We went on a Tuesday night right in time for the wine and bruschetta special. We must have good timing. Mmmm! I love bruschetta and wine, it was like I came to my happy place and they knew what I wanted to order! My favorite was the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It's the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I could eat that everyday - no problem!  The restaurant was crazy busy, but they offered valet parking, which was a nice touch. There isn't much available parking so I rather leave it to the professionals and take the stress out of my night! I think the wait staff was a little overwhelmed because it took awhile for our food and drinks and our server seemed in the weeds, but I can be patient when enjoying time with good friends! I'll definitely be back!",

The starter that I had was absolutely delicious. The artichoke dpi was fresh and tasted natural compared to many restaurants who have processed dips.  The hummus was also homemade and delicious. The kalamata olives added a nice touch.   The Mediterranean salad was scrumptious and was a normal portion size in comparison to other places.    Overall I was really pleased and will be coming every time I'm in Arizona.   Also I plan to try some of the bruschettas they look delicious on my neighbors table.",

    "text": "Where to begin... oh that's right, I shall start with OMG YUM!  This place is a new favorite of mine. It is situated in the heart of Central Phoenix. During the day hours and HH you have to valet due to the parking situation in the surrounding area for the offices. No big. If you end up coming later in the evening, there is a small lot that you can park in. The ambiance is relaxing, casual, European and modern all in one. They have a small patio which can be looked at as a romantic area for two to enjoy some great times over wine.  The wines BTG are decently priced and quite delicious. I was actually shocked to see certain varietals on their list as most people do not even know certain ones exist. For example, the delicious Austtian wine the Zweigelt. It hit the spot and paired nicely with the bruschette. And order of bruschette lets you choose four types from their list. This time, it was: the prosciutto and fig, the margerita, the bacon tomato and arugula and the smoked salmon with pesto.  Wow... they were all so delicious I cannot wait to go back again. I must say that my favorites would be the prosciutto/fig and the smoked salmon w/house made pesto. Both were presented beautifully and tasted absolutely amazing. Fresh ingredients paired with flavors that are not overpowering. They really know what they are doing at this place. I cannot wait to go back to try a different menu item and enjoy more delicious HH wine!",

Plus, Postino has that semi-romantic setting that is perfect for such a day. That being said, the food is made with love, and if I am to eat these particular items, this is probably the place to go. $5 pitchers until 5 pm; that's a nice touch as well. I love the atmosphere here: hip, classy, and relaxing (complete with live music). The server was friendly, and I can't complain about complimentary valet parking either. Overall, a great experience, and I would recommend Postino on Central for special occasions and/or date nights.",

Great patio and service!!  My friend and I waited at the bar until a table was available.  The bartender immediately greeted us and was friendly.  I tried the honey cucumber lemonade. It was so good and refreshing.  My friend and I decided to share some bruschetta.  We chose the brie and apples with fig spread, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, salmon with pesto, and prosciutto with figs.   A-MAZING!!!  All of the ingredients were fresh and very tasty.  I don't think I have ever had anything like it before.  Once we got a table my friend and I decided to proceed to dessert.  We tried the salted carmel sundae.  It was a perfect combination of sweet and salty.  The only down side of Postino is the parking.  It's terrible, but thankfully there is free valet available.",

For a party of 2, I was stuffed after eating the bruschetta and a Mixed Green salad.  Bruschetta ($14 for 4) ordered: - Brie and Apples with Fig Spread - Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone -- my favorite of the night - Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese - Smoked Salmon with Pesto  Postino is a great restaurant for a casual dinner with friends or a date night. Service was outstanding. I just wish I was hungrier or was with a larger party so I could try everything on the menu.",

A party of 4 we got the appetizer ($12.75) and chose: brie & apples with fig spread (love the sweet and salty combo), Burrata bacon arugula & tomatoes, roasted peppers with goat cheese (so creamy), salami with pesto. Each piece is cut into 4 so it's easy to share.  After bruschetta we each got the Select 2 for $9.5 which includes half a panini and a side salad or soup. It was a bit too much food for me but it was delicious. The Italian Picnic salad had all my favorite salad toppings: beets, goat cheese, bacon, walnuts with a vinaigrette dressing. Though the panini was good, I think I would have preferred eating 2 more bruschetta, after all it is their specialty!   Seating is easy, there's an outdoor patio with misters, indoor seating, and an indoor and outdoor bar area. The ambiance is versatile which makes Postinos a great place for a date or casual dining with friends.",

    "text": "First of all, you will be hard pressed to find someone that doesn't like Postino's. I mean even my ubber-macho-not-so-much-wine-drinkers guy friends love this place. It is also one of the only places I do not mind waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a table and in the Arizona summer no less.   I have been to the one on 40th street a bazillion times and finally made it up to the on on Central last night for a girl friends belated birthday dinner. Side note - gotta love a place with complimentary valet! Only complaint I could possibly have is that the hostess made me wait for my friends all to arrive before she would seat me. I got there early to make sure to beat the crowed, as it was a Tuesday and their totally awesome $20 special was going on. By the time my untimely friends arrived (25 min later) the wait had tripled, but she did leave me on the list and once they arrived we only had to wait another 15 minutes. Also, kudos to the bartender who got us started on our wine while we were waiting.   There wine list is awesome and the staff knows the most intimate details about each. The Grenache is my fave so we started with a bottle of that to go with out bruschetta selection of Brie and Apple, Prosciutto Fig and Mascarpone, Tomato Jam and Sheep's Milk, and the Salami with Pesto. Side note: Always ask what the soup of the day is, if the response is Roasted Red Pepper and Gorgonzola... DO NOT think twice, order a bowl!!!!, it goes fast. The best soup ever!!! Second round we had the Grenache Blanc, waitresses recommendation. It was crisp, creamy, limy and yummy. Perfect choice to go with the second board of bruschetta, Apple with Brie and Preschiutto with Fig again 'cuz they are awesome, then we switched it up and got the Salmon with Pesto and the Roasted Red Pepper with Goat Cheese, yummy!   You will never go wrong with Postino's no matter what you order or which one you go to. Great specials and friendly staff!",

They have a very extensive wine list and their cocktails are delicious as well. Some of their cocktails take a bit of time, but that's because everything is freshly squeezed.   I've tried some of their sandwiches here and they definitely don't hold a candle to their bruschetta and other appetizers. Try \"the plate\" from Postinos- a blend of peppers, salami, asparagus, olives, etc.  The staff here is super friendly, helpful, non pretentious, and good looking! You get a bit of a hipster vibe here.   Mondays are a great night to go here after 8 for their special : 20 dollars for their bruschetta and a bottle of wine!

I paired up a French Syrah. with date and pistachio bruschetta...Winner. My dining companion had a Cab, and ordered Tomato/Mozzarella/Basil bruschetta.  The tomatoes were beefsteak..which is unusual but good. Its like they were grown in someone's garden.  The menu is alot deeper than I can relate, but just know that there is an artisan touch related to pairing food with the wine.  I think that pairing can make you more of wine fan.",

    "text": "Absolutely one of my favorite Phoenix stops.    The wine list is fantastic and changes regularly (not sure how often, I just know there was a shakeup since we started going there).  The wait staff is knowledgeable and well versed in the wines they serve.  They have given us spot-on recommendations about MANY different types of wines and have always been honest and True.  My wife is not a huge wine fan, but told them the couple types she's tried and enjoyed - and they have recommended a few that she has really loved.  They do not steer you in the wrong direction.  I love just going and asking for a new recommendation based on a couple things, and I find something new and tasty nearly every time!  Best value is to get there before 5pm.  All glasses of wine are $5 until 5pm.  A very easy and inexpensive way to try some new wines to see if you like them.    The food is quite tasty as well.  It seems like small bites, but it usually quite plenty for our group.  There are usually 3 or 4 of us at most, and we ALWAYS get the bruschetta.  It is fantastic.  Different flavors come with each one, which is great for the variety.  The smoked salmon is so smooth and tasty (and I don't love salmon, so I was surprised how much I enjoyed it).  The pesto is fantastic - whatever they offer with pesto, get it.  Think my favorite flavor of bruschetta is the tomato jam and cream cheese.  It seems odd but is great.    The sandwich/paninis are great as well.  The turkey pesto is great and the chicken with sun dried tomato sauce is AMAZING.  We have a hard time trying new things just because we like these so much.  Service has always been attentive and helpful without being overbearing.  Water is refilled often and everyone has been exceptionally pleasant.",

Open and breezy on a beautiful day. $5 wines during happy hour, and beer specials too. A beautiful courtyard, awesome music, and most importantly the best food. All of the salads are devine, the vegetarian panini on ciabatta is delicious, and you can never go wrong with the soup of the day. Go to Postinos, find parking or let the valet do the work, and enjoy this little place that's perfect for Phoenix, but would be a success anywhere!",

And they had no problem making it with egg whites just like I love it. My husband had the egg and bacon which he said was perfectly done. My son had it with regular eggs and they were made perfectly. One companion had the salmon and eggs and loved it. Another had the scones with an egg and bacon. The scones were light and just right--not dry like some scones can be. And the devonshire sauce was incredible. Our dishes all came with a lovely fruit bowl. I had the Mimosa which was lovely and at $5--a bargain.   I totally love Postinos for lunch and now it's my new favorite for an affordable and DELISH brunch! Not one of our meals was over $10! So worth the price of admission!",

    "text": "My friends recommended this place to me because of their unique bruschetta. I know how to make bruschetta at home and I thought to myself, 'What's so special about it? It's just chopped up tomatoes, onions with olive oil, basil and balsamic.\" But this place definitely takes bruschetta to a new level, they try different combinations to keep it interesting!  So I had to check it out with my friend on a hot day in the Valley.  This place has misters outside and it was nice and cool inside. We just came back from the heat so coming inside felt nice. We came here on a Sunday in the late afternoon and early evening, probably around 4pm. So it wasn't too busy.  I was so thirsty so I asked for a cup of water and they were excellent in constantly refilling my water.   We were impressive with the price of the bruschetta. We thought they are reasonably priced.   We ordered: Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios and Brie & Apples with Fig spread.  My favorite is between the Smoked Salmon with Pesto and the Brie & Apples with Fig spread. I feel like you can't ever go wrong with smoked salmon and pesto! I like the brie and apples with fig spread because it had a sweet, tangy but sour taste. It was a great combination of flavors.  The ricotta with dates and pistachios is sweet with a slight crunch from the nuts  I felt like the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, I love all these items separately but together they didn't quite go together. Prosciutto is delicious but with the figs and mascarpone, the flavors didn't blend quite the way I like it.  The bread was a little crunchy/crispy so it did scratch the top of my mouth a little. I would like it if the bread (especially) the crust was a little more soft.   +Great, unique bruschetta! Come for it, try all the different flavors to see what combination you like!",

Postino has some very good appetizers and sandwich meals as well as some decent soup and salad options but the real reason to come is the wine.  Do yourself a favor an come during happy hour, order a couple of appetizers, and tell the waitress (I never seem to see male waiters when I go...) what your wine preferences are and let her chose a couple glasses for you.  Repeat the process until you have had far to much wine and call a cab or have a sober friend drive you home.  All in all a great place to try wines you don't normally find in grocery stores and a nice enough place to take pretty much anyone on pretty much any occasion (barring truly fancy/special events).",

On Monday and Tuesday nights, Postino has a $20 special (not to be confused with happy hour) that includes a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board. We ordered the Nine Iron panini, a bottle of Sola Fred red wine, and a bruschetta board consisting of the following selections (check my photos, too!):  Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios Brie & Apples with Fig Spread Smoked Salmon with Pesto Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone   My absolute favorite was the salmon and pesto, but I definitely appreciated the salty crunch of the pistachio and ricotta, and the sweet juxtaposition of the sweet figs and prosciutto. I did not care for the coldness of the apple and brie. I honestly don't remember much of the panini except that it was \"good\", mainly because I was so enthralled with the bruschetta. By the time I had turned my attention to the panini, I had also had a good amount of wine.  Halfway through our meal, a manager (presumably) appeared and apologized for the amount of time it took for a waitress to take our order. It was extremely busy and we therefore did not think anything of the \"wait\" but still appreciated the very, very generous comp. Clearly, Postino takes their customer service seriously!   Beware! Seating wait times are very long, especially for groups. Because we had a group of more than 8, the man who answered the phone was very polite and helpful in reserving a table, resulting in quick seating.  If it's just you and a friend, no problem! They have fireplaces you can sit next to. All in all, I definitely recommend this place. I love me some vino!",

I am back to salads for a few days.  It was well worth it.  I still like the Arcadia location better,  Central was really loud, so it was harder to talk to everyone when you have a large table.  I still loved it  anyways.  Can't wait to be back.",

    "text": "Recently met up with friends on a Saturday afternoon for mimosas and $5 wines. I had not been to this location! Postino Arcadia is my hang out. Gotta say.. I like this one as much! Well, minus the valet dealio. But really there is not much space to do much with. I am such a fan of Postino bruschettas..I raved about them to my boyfriend for months before I got him in here on this particular Saturday. So, instead of him letting me shine my bruschetta knowledge on him..somehow he tells the waiter he wants a mix up and before I could intervene.. the waiter is off and brings us a variety of bruschetta he chose. NOT what I would have chose. But okay. Sometimes I like to be controlling. I am working on that;-) We gobbled that one board down.. and we order another.. Always my favs, of course, (there's that Postino bruschetta knowledge and control thing again!), salami pesto; tomato jam/sheeps milk cheese;roasted peppers/goat cheese; proscuitto/fig/mascarpone cheese.. yum. I wish that Postino would let the customers fill out a card though on 'ideas' for bruschettas. I'd love to see a hot jam with a goat cheese. Or a pancetta and sharper cheese like a french salut or even a sheep's milk cheese. I am never, ever disappointed with Postino. Not.Ever. Great salads. Paninis. Adore the cheese board. Love the $5 wine hours on the daily and the mimosas too. Now I have my boyfriend loving it and thankfully, there are enough brews on tap that he likes should it not be a wine day for him.",

It was everything I had hoped it would be warm, inviting and in general awesome...too bad I can not say the same for my date LOL!  Maybe you will have better luck with your company, but the patio is very plesant and you can not beat the $20 special on wine and brushetta on Mondays and Tuesdays!  If you go on one of those days, I suggest going after nine when the crowds/parking are not so ridiculous.",

I can't really decide which one is my favorite, I like them all. Of course, Tuesday nights are the best because of the $20.00 special for a bruchetta and a bottle of wine, the wait is looooong, but hey! do what my friends I do, get your bottle of wine while you wait in the parking lot, by the time your table is ready (3 bottles later) LIFE IS GOOD! =) All the paninis and salads are awesome! The service is good. Price? Honey, you get what you pay! =) and you do not have to drive all the way to Scottsdale to get so.",

    "text": "Yum!    I am a huge fan of their brushetta.  I don't think I've eaten anything else but it!  This was my first time at the Central location.  I came on a Friday afternoon around 2.  Parking was an absolute nightmare and I had to park across the street at the Circle K and pray that my car wasn't broken into.  We also didn't have a great seating arrangement.  It would have been nicer if they would have noticed all sitting in the middle of the patio and taking up half the walkway and let us sit at a table when one opened, but they never did.  Also, when I went to the bar and asked if they served any other alcohol besides wine and beer, the bartender told me no.  Later, I saw someone with another type of drink.  When I asked, they told me it was a mimosa and that they also served Belinis.  Not sure why the bartender didn't tell me that when I had tried to order a drink instead of serving me water.  Seems silly....but whatever.  I ordered the brushetta platter.  It was delicious!  I believe I ordered the goat cheese and bell pepper (it was my least favorite of all, but still good), the mozarella & tomato (yum), apple & fig (delicious), and prosciutto (spelling???)--it was my favorite!!!  I would definitely come back, only because of the delicious food!!",

Postino, however, has lovingly converted the old building into something truly grand.  It's a DIY's paradise of interestingly applied building materials - no those red trusses aren't structural, but they're nice to look at, aren't they?  You will spend a little money here. Give them your business card, get on the mailing lists, make sure to show up for happy hour, and take advantage of nights with specials (Tuesday and Thursday seem to be popular down the Central corridor there).  If you have a group of more than 2, expect to wait a little while. But do, it's worth your time for the goat cheese and roasted red pepper bruschetta and a glass of bubbly.   The patio is lovely, despite being close to the parking lot. The valets are pleasant, please let them help you unless it's very late or very early in the day. People at Postino dress up a litte, there is a larger than average amount of eye candy, it speaks of affluence. So go ahead, wear your Sam Edelman keyhole peeptoes and order that big fat red wine with a hint of bologna in the flavor. You'll be glad you did.",

I started with a Pinot Grigio and moved to a Californian Pinot Noir. We ordered three trays of bruschetta to share and at $14 a plate we were all stuffed. Everything I had was great but the one with the figs was probably my favorite followed by the one w pistachios and one w salmon and pesto. Eating outdoors in Phoenix on a Friday night in February is a treat and the servers were truly on their game. It was a great night.  Y'all should go.",

I think this place is more about the atmosphere than the food; which is okay. As long as you know that when you come here. The design is great, the feeling/atmosphere is equally as good, but the food and wine are mediocre. A great place on Monday nights (which is when we came) because of the special. However, you might have to wait. Would I come on a night other than their special? Probably not. But, they seem to have it together and the waitstaff seems to know what they are doing. And that is something to be said for any establishment these days. Get the girl with the short hair - I don't know her name- but she seems to be the most knowledgeable and experienced of all.",
