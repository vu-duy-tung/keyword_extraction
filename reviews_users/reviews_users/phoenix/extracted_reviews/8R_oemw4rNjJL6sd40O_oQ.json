    "text": "The one thing this place has going for it is the food. Which is lucky from them because they have a few strikes against them IMO.  The boyfriend and I went there at around 11am on Sunday. I thought the crowd would have died down by then. Wrong! 25 min or so wait. Oh well. at least there are benches to wait on.   Walking in I was struck by the lack of atmosphere. I had gone to their old location once and while this place is bigger, it lacks the character the other location had so that was a bummer.  We got a table near the wall. This place is packed! The tables are very close together so if you want to have a private conversation you came to the wrong place. Also, they don't have any sound dampeners so it's very loud in there. The woman at the table next to us was practically yelling her conversation.  But the saving grace was the food. It was really good. I had the brioche french toast with bananas and pecans and boyfriend had a breakfast burrito. My french toast was done perfectly and had a nice caramel syrup on it that wasn't too sweet. The burrito was big and had a good flavor as well. The eggs were nice and creamy.  If only they could dampen the noise, this place would be awesome.Going there with a hangover would suck!  But I would totally go back for the food. Maybe I'll just have to bring earplugs.",

I had ordered pancakes, eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and was going to settle for Coffee when the waiter told me that they have a really great black tea. Shortly after ordering, he brought a teapot loaded with Chai tea and a container of Honey. Although I consider myself somewhat of a entry-level tea connoisseur, I must admit that this was simply the best tea I had ever had. Additionally, the overall experience of this restaurant is amazing and it shows at about 9AM when the diner is completely packed. This was the highlight of my first trip to Phoenix! Thanks",

My friend and I each ordered the 2 egg breakfast and decided to get an order of French toast to split since we were both starving. Our service was pretty good and our server was very friendly. I thought the food was great. My hashbrowns were cooked perfectly. They were crispy and delicious. The French toast was also good- nothing too exciting but it was good. The only things I didn't like was that it seemed a little cramped in there and they use the menus as placemats which I think is kind of gross. Obviously they wipe them off after each guest but it just seemed a little gross to me for some reason. I would definitely return and try something new.",

The staff, as well as the owners are always in a good mood, but at the same time no one is ever \"fake-nice\". Sometimes I come across a wait at the restaurant, however it never feels like the wait is long.  I've had several different menu items, but my favorite is always the pancakes. I know, I know, simple but delicious!! I've never had a bad food experience here and thus every time I show up I know it's going to be good. Also, please note the coffee. I am a coffee-aholic, so good coffee in a joint is important to me and they definately have it. Always good, and always fresh.   The restaurant itself is small, with only a few tables inside, a patio and the counter by the register. What I love about Over Easy is that its laid back. Over easy is not trying to be trendy or pretentious in any way. It's breakfast people, let's not make this too complicated before noon.",

Manager was awful: The menu is creative and well executed, a skosh on the \"pricey\" side if you're used to diners and such, but well worth the extra. But, for food so well executed, I was surprised at how lousy the coffee was - mine tasted burnt.   And waiter had the right cadence for a Sunday. The bus staff was prompt as well.  When it came time to pay the bill, however, it was a lousy experience. The restaurant \"reads\" like a \"pay at cashier\" and so all trooped up to the front. Uh-oh, should have paid the waiter. Manager immediately stepped in - she was snippy, curt, etc. You have to realize, we were a party of 5 and had no intent other than to pay our bill - we were informed that (after being led to believe otherwise) \"they don't do separate checks, but can separate the bill.\" (into equal parts). While part of the party reacted, rather than wait the 30 seconds it would have taken, she walked immediately away with whatever payment was in her hand...which then proceeded to utterly confuse everything when she came back. My advice? Eat and get the hell out, apparently waitstaff and management can't agree on restaurant policy.",

I love spinach and wanted something at least somewhat healthy (and delicious) that wasn't easily 1,000 calories. Eh - not so successful. It was a sort of quiche - with a lot in it - had a crust. The flavors were good, BUT it was incredibly salty. Not inedible, but, for me, if the primary taste is salt, that isn't good.   Service was indifferent. She took my order, delivered my order (did ask me if I wanted hot sauce), dropped off the check and picked up my cash and that was IT. I wasn't ignored, but certainly I didn't feel very welcome. It wasn't busy there - it wouldn't have killed her to ask me how my breakfast was.   The small fruit salad side was excellent - more than just melon and grapes - included pineapple plus. All of the fruit was an extremely acceptable state of ripeness. (I'm sick of not at all ripe melon and grapes that most restaurants seem to think is acceptable.)  The price was $10 plus tax. If it was salted properly - I think I would have been pretty happy - the flavors would have come through properly. As it was, between too much salt, no wifi and indifferent service - I may go back, but probably not.",

We arrived about 12:20 so most of the rush was over although it was still busy and our wait to be seated was less than the 20 minutes predicted.  The service was expeditious and friendly.  The food came out in good time and  I can't say enough about the chicken fried steak and egg.  It was delicious and obviously made to order fresh. The batter had a nice spice on the end, it was crispy but moist and the gravy is a perfect compliment.  We will definitely go back for the chicken fried steak as well as to try some of the other yummy sounding meals on the menu.  I also enjoyed the fact that the owner/manager was walking around the tables on a regular basis and inquiring as to whether each person was satisfied with their meal.  We eat out at many different establishments and rarely see that kind of attention to the patrons.  The only thing I could complain about is the annoying whining of the woman sitting next to me who was obviously one of those people who is never happy.  She complained that there was not enough vegitarian \"non fatty\" selections, that she needed  2% milk for her coffee not half-n-half, that her english muffin wasn't toasted enough and when they brought her another one that was clearly toasted more she didn't even eat it.  Coming to a place like Over Easy and expecting a large selection of vegitarian/diet foods is simply ridiculous as this place serves exactly what the name suggests, traditional breakfast foods that are comforting and homey.  The way Mom used to make it with plenty of meat and potatos and loads of flavor.",

They have no steak knives, which is just a bit weird for a place that serves chicken fried steak.   I'm not really sure what I had because I love chicken fried steak, and this was terrible fried terrible.   We would never, ever consider going to the Over Easy for anything again.

    "text": "As far as breakfast goes, Over Easy is definitely a cut above the rest of the competition.  The pancakes are perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and fluffy, but not too airy on the inside.  The biscuits and gravy were tremendously satisfying.  The biscuits were not cakey at all, but were light, airy and had just enough jalapeno spice and cheese to really provide a unique textural and flavor component to the dish.  The egg-muffin sandwiches however are nothing to rave about, and are rather pedestrian and come in very small portions.  Overall, I think Over Easy could benefit from larger portions and more combination plates.  A pancake platter with eggs and potatoes would be greatly appreciated.",

I'm not taking points off for the wait, but I am taking points off for average to bad food...Like Bob B, I had the chicken fried steak and yes it was very stringy and I too had to spit out a piece of it into my napkin. I chewed and chewed and chewed but I couldn't get it down which was disappointing because I wanted to like this place, I really wanted to like it, but the truth is, the CFS and eggs at IHOP are more  flavorful than what I was served that day. And cartilage, isn't that a major no no...?  Wife had the chicken and waffles, she said it was just average. Iced coffee with cardimum was interesting, was it bad...no, would I order it again, probably not. Guy Fieri....you have let me down again, first it was Chino Bandido (2 hour wait), sorry Over Easy, I'll give you another chance one day, but Wildflower Bread Company will remain my current Sunday brunch spot.",

My favorite is the chiquiles, but I also get scrambled eggs with spinach, garlic and tomatoes. Sometimes we just say \"surprise me\" and something terrific shows up at the table. The new locations is a lot easier since there is plenty of parking and no long wait!",

    "text": "So, I went to Over Easy once before and it was \"ok\". Nothing great, they were super short handed, we got a free waffle because it took so long, the chicken fried steak and eggs were grissly but the gravy was good. But, I decided to give it another try. Huge mistake. We get there and the same staff problem..2 servers for the small, but very busy restaurant. My 2 friends each got the same thing, the Wolfpack. It was supposed to be eggs and chz layered between hashbrowns. I got the sirloin steak and eggs with carmalized onions. Their breakfast came out with sliced half cooked country potatoes-apparently they were out of hash browns?! How is that possible...they only serve breakfast and it was 10:30am. Mine came, it wasn't what I ordered. Fine, honest mistake, not a big deal...they went to remake it. Our server never once came over, not once, to apologize or to check to see if the food that did come was ok, which it wasn't. My breakfast came after my friends were done with what they could eat...This is the worst part. It was a plate of watery liuid gravy, grissly meat that looked like dog food, and the eggs were gooey. I took three bites of the eggs, I was starving, and couldnt eat anymore. Horrible. All three of us were still hungry when we left and frustrated as heck. They comped my breakfast... but not a chance Ill go back. I'd rather have Denny's or IHOP any day. I really think a lot of these crazy 4 and 5 star reviews are employees... no way this place was capable of 5 stars.",

First of all, if you are going to eat here we recommend you sit at the counter looking into the kitchen like we did so you can see the cooks mopping up grease off your eggs with the same towel they dropped on the floor and have been using to pull pans out of the oven and move saute pans with. Health code aside, the food was the most disappointing we have ever had. I ordered the Wolf pack over easy at, get this, Over Easy. The eggs were completely hard buried in crappy frozen hash browns. Before I even got this steaming pile we watched it sit under the warmer for 10 minutes while they killed my wife's egg white omelette. Over an inch thick and completely over cooked, it broke in half when they \"folded\" it. It had burnt edges all around from the broiler. Once the food was finally delivered and we looked at the mess in front of us, we dropped several dollars down for our coffee, pushed our plates away, and drove to Matt's Big Breakfast.",

It's hard to find a great quaint little breakfast place that is actually accessible at all times (sorry, Matt's). The decor is great. This old Taco Bell has barely been converted at all, save for a few walls knocked down to make a patio -- a very cool wood-encased little shell of a space. The open-air roof keeps it breathable, but you're cool as a cucumber. The inside is diner supreme: bright colors comfy bar stools in a rub-your-elbows-sized room. I think the prices are very decent and you get bigass portions. I had the sirloin and eggs. I was craving something hearty, and I got it. This is like half a cow chopped up into little bites, three eggs however you like them, carmelized onions cooked to perfect tenderness and diced jalapenos for some added kick. It rocked my life. And have you tried the Over Easy iced coffee? Cold-brewed coffee (read: strong) over ice with sweetened condensed milk, cardamom and cinnamon with mint leaves. It's f'ing ecstasy. Try it, you'll love it.",

The GM is great and very friendly. You can tell he is very involved in the operation of this place. Also, his beard is probably the most majestic thing I've ever seen. Seriously. It's beautiful.   The bus boy(man?) was a little too eager to take our plates. I had barely set my utensils down and he snatched it up. While we were waiting for our food, he kept coming around and picking up our straw wrappers and whatever little bits of trash on the table. Thanks for keep my area clean but please wait or ask if you can take any trash or plates. I felt a little rushed out considering it took 30mins for our food.   Overall, I'd come back.

    "text": "My husband and I went here for breakfast. It was pretty busy, we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. You should definately come hungry because the portions are large. I had the malted waffle, turkey bacon and an over easy egg. The waffle was tender, light and fluffy. My husband had jalapeno cheddar biscuits and gravy. They had just the right amount of spice. I would have given them 5 stars but was disappointed and a little disgusted with the restroom. They have 2 restrooms that are unisex. Apparently I picked the one that the men mainly use because there was pee on the floor in front of the toilet. Disgusting!!! I just about lost my breakfast. I understand that the staff can't go in to check the restrooms after every customer. But why wouldn't they just make one restroom for women and one for men. Since they do have 2 available for use. I don't want to sit in someone else's pee.  My suggestion would be to check the floor before you sit.",

We had brought a guest with us and frankly I was embarrassed because the location was my choice. I don't see how this place rates the rave reviews I have heard. I am not sure if it's because we have a small child and they are targeting the hipster crowd but we felt very unwelcomed and unwanted there. Very sad and we will not be going back.",

I came here after watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and knew I was going to order the caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast. How was it? Ummm...absolutely divine!!! The second time I came here, (LoL) I decided I didn't want to wait and I arrived at 6:40am. Yup, I learned my lesson the first time. FYI: These days were during the weekend...so they have a tendency to be more crowded. I recently went back here to bring some friends for breakfast and as always the food was great. We got everything that was featured from Food Network. =o) I wasn't too sure about the waffle dogs after watching it from Best Thing I Ever Ate because it's just a sausage in waffle batter...that you can really compare to a corn dog. I was completely wrong! The waffle dogs were so perfect! The ratio of sausage to batter was great! It was just so tasty! To be perfectly honest, we ended up having to get another order after devouring our other plates. It's a definite MUST-TRY! The dipping sauce totally caught me off guard...I think I was just expecting something sweet, but boy was I in for a little shock! It's actually a mix of Cholula Hot Sauce and maple syrup. The after shock of something spicy was a little weird, but dip the waffle dog into the sauce and it's a perfect combination! I find myself just thinking about these waffle dogs and how easy it would be to just eat them as I drive to work. *drool* The next time I come, I might just have to order 2 or 3 orders just for me (I don't want to share). LoL!",

    "text": "A big thank you to Brad, who invited me to try Over-Easy out again after my lackluster experience a few weeks back.  I love to see Yelp reuniting restaurants and patrons, creating harmony in the food world, once again.   Our service was about 1000x better on this visit.  Our server was thoughtful, attentive, and made sure that we were well taken care of.  Our meals were delicious.  None of the average food that we found last time... perhaps due to an increased sense about their strengths.  Just stick to what they are best at, and you'll be a happy camper.  I ordered the chicken and waffle.  The waffle could have been a little crisper, but the flavor was perfect.  The chicken was expertly seasoned, and the combination was only elevated by a large splash of hot sauce and lots of maple syrup.  Of course, you must be a fan of the sweet/spicy/savory combination to appreciate this dish.  My friend had a breakfast burrito that looked delicious, but I was actually more impressed with the side dish of fruit.  No silly bowl of melon here - just bright, fresh berries.  Mmm!  Definitely an upgrade from typical fruit garnishes.   I am still sad that there are so many tables, and a lack of defined space... but the improved food and service from my last visit definitely warrants a +2 star improvement.    Over Easy, we can still be friends :)",

The chicken fried chicken with waffle hot sauce/syrup is worth a tasting, but Lola's is probably better. Definitely will go back.

    "text": "A few weeks ago a friend sent me a text message of what looked like corndogs with powdered sugar on them. The caption read \"You have to check this place out\". Being a person that believes that any food you put on a stick must be delicious, I was intrigued and found out later that those were NOT corndogs, rather they were Waffle Dogs... a piece of sausage, dipped in waffle batter, and deep fried. SOLD!  After a morning hike the hubs and I headed over to the Over Easy location on Indian School and we did wait about 20 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was full of people, always a good sign.  We sat down, were greeted by a very busy, but friendly, server. We ordered the waffle dogs, the hubs got the 'wolf pack' and I ordered off the menu, just an egg, some tomatoes and toast. (Sadly, I am watching what I eat, and figured that the waffle dogs were more than enough to guilt me the rest of the day)  The table behind us asked the same server what Over Easy was known for, and his answer \"We are known for everything except for our healthy options\". I laughed because the joint DOES have some great healthy options, including omelets, yogurt with granola, etc however those don't hold a candle to the incredibly creative and delicious options that the menu is filled with.  Both of our orders were delicious, and we will definitely be back. If you haven't been to either location, I highly suggest you check it out. Local, fun, creative and delicious. Annie likes.",

Their version of it has been hit or miss before, but when it was good, it was very good. I went in this morning, around 8:15am. First sign of things not so good, the place was practically empty.. I ordered the chiliquilies with the eggs sunnyside up.. Dish arrived a few minutes later. It was lukewarm. The sauce was very minimal. The plate was almost like some cheese nachos with a few pieces of chicken and two eggs on top.. What little sauce that was on it had no OOMPH.. It used to be that this dish was very flavorful and could almost cause you to get a little sweat on the forehead..Not any more..  I will give the cook credit for knowing how to cook sunnyside up eggs. They were cooked perfectly. My server never came by to check on things. To make matters worse, the manager lady (I think she may be the daughter of owner Brad May) was sitting at the counter on her cell phone and eating breakfast my entire visit. Not once did she get up to check on any customer in the place.   So, we have hit and miss (mostly miss in my last few visits) food. We have uncaring and unattentive service (starting with the manager).. the only remaining \"good\" in my book is location-it is fairly close to home. But so is Snooze, and Daily Dose, and Essence Bakery.. The competition wins out on this contest.   I think it is time to stick a fork in Overeasy.. It's done.",

    "text": "I agree with Laura E, Over Easy is now just Meh!!! What's happened to Over Easy?  HELLO Mr Owners of OE, your service and food have changed since your move and it's not a good change...  We've watched the decline of this little \"hole in da wall\" breakfast joint that used to be one of the best places to go in the mornings ~ Pre Food Network and Triple D....  I can see where your trying to accommodate more people in your new place but COME ON, I was elbowed twice while eating next to strangers beside us!  This is not a comfortable environment for dinning unless you want to get cozy and share your food with strangers...  The service was very disappointing, blunderous, and left us wanting.  Our drinks were not maintained and when we had issue concerning our meal our server told us it would be a while before we could get another order of pancakes, without an apology.   We had the chicken and waffles, which were ok ~ the chicken was nice and crisp but was a little over done. The waffle was flat and plain. We also had pancakes with sides of bacon and sausage. The pancakes were cold for some reason so we wanted to order some fresh but our server was not helpful. The bacon was very good as was the sausage.  We also had the Wolfpack, which was very good with two eggs, bacon and cheese between layers of crisp buttery hashbrownie goodness. Very filling but not something to order if your watching your carb in take.   I hope you listen to the Yelpers and make some changes soon.  There are too many other places to dine for breakfast and lunch that are as good if not better than you now.  After all the Food Network foodies have tried your place for the first and last time ~ The Yelpers (regulars) want the old Over Easy service and quality of food back please.",

Aside from hygiene, and preparedness, the wait for our food was horrendous - a party of six, which I called ahead for, after having placed our order, waited about a half hour before our breakfast was served. Eggs, bacon, tortilla, sauteed mushrooms all served at best lukewarm - nothing takes more than 10 min to make very well. Extremely disappointed. If I could give less than a star, I would.",

    "text": "Man. This place was so disappointing. I was trying to think of a place to eat breakfast this morning, and this place popped into my head. I don't know why, I think I had heard of it from someone, but anyway, we were in the neighborhood so we went.   That was the mistake.   We waited outside for about 20 minutes, which wasn't so bad, considering this place was on tv and whatnot. We got seated over by the wall... really close to the people next to us. The place was loud and the person sitting next to me was yelling the whole time... did not stop. We were basically sitting at the same table as this person so that was annoying. Not the restaurant's fault though.   So I ordered the chicken and waffles at the waiter's recommendation and the BF ordered pancakes and bacon. We both ordered coffee (2.25 for a cup of drip coffee?!?!?! how do they charge so much?). The coffee wasn't terrible, not great, but not bad, kind of metallic, also we didn't get a second refill on the coffee... cups stood empty. The waiter brought out a tiny thing of half and half but never refilled it (the coffee was much worse without cream). Our food came quickly. The chicken was a fried breast on top of a thin waffle. The chicken actually had decent flavor, but the waffle was completely tasteless, soggy, and detracted from the overall flavor of the food... useless calories.  So my food was not terrible... but not good by any means, and for 9$, it should have been good. The real reason for the one star was the BF's pancakes. WTF. These pancakes were terrible. They had no flavor and they were dry as could be. These pancakes were not as good as bisquick at home. They were not as good as the pancakes at mcdonalds. They were not as good as those frozen pancakes that you microwave. How did they make pancakes so bad? At a popular breakfast place no less. In addition, the syrup was in a squeeze bottle on the table... not heated up or anything. The syrup was flavorless as well... mrs. butterworth's is better. So gross. And the bacon (4$), was so small. 3 wimpy soggy slices that were not at all crispy. Then I got the bill. 25$. Wow. This place has some nerve charging that much for this poor excuse of a breakfast.   Never again, I would go get a frozen breakfast from the grocery store before I would come get food here again.",

The \"Tammy\" breakfast sandwich was full of flavor but not very hearty (makes a great light breakfast), the hash-browns super crispy that the entire thing could be picked up with a fork and none of them fall off. I like the hash that way, my friend didn't. They didn't put all the ingredients in her omelet that she asked for, but she claimed it \"not bad\". Also, still had a hard time getting a refill for my coffee.  The next time I ordered the eggs with mushrooms and herbs. Definitely were not stingy with the shrooms, they were piled on. Probably wouldn't have hurt to use some more herbs, but it was still  delicious! Skipped the coffee, so didn't have to worry about refills, and glad I did because I saw the time it took for other tables to get there's. Also, this time they made my friends omelet correct.",

    "text": "After reading the Yelp reviews and growing a bit tired of our usual breakfast place selections, Over Easy seemed like a sure thing.  We arrived and found both the place and a parking spot with no problem.  Plus, we were early enough that we got seated right away.  That's about all of the good stuff that happened.  We were seated in the back, behind a large wall section (possible expansion of the kitchen area?  I'm not too sure) with dim lighting and one table next to us.  The servers kept forgetting that we were there, and getting refills on water was a bit of a pain.  Can't say much else for the service or ambiance, as they weren't really there much, and we were HIDDEN BEHIND A GIANT WALL (respectively).  The food can best be described as \"edible.\"  I tried the Wolfpack, which came with the most artificial-tasting bacon that I've ever eaten, and so much grease on the hash browns that it should have had its own mention on the menu.  My breakfast buddies got the pancakes (not fully cooked) and the banana pecan French toast (soggy and minuscule).  We all left feeling hungry, and proceeded to a nearby fast food place for added sustenance.  Also, the coffee was lousy.  Sometimes, it's a better idea to stay in and make your own breakfast.  When it came to the experience at Over Easy, that's definitely what we should have done.",

The line wasn't very long as it was almost noon on a Saturday which I guess was more brunch but whatever I just woke up lol.  So I got my favorite which is waffle dogs and they were just as great as always.  There is a reason these were on best I ever ate.  The mix of waffle, breakfast sausage, syrup, and cholula just go so well together.  You would never look at those items and mix them but when you try it you will be hooked just like I am.",

Portions were pretty sizeable..I only finished about half of what was on my plate. It seemed like they used more than two eggs (maybe 4 or 5?) and the cheese that I requested to be added on was a solid amount of ooey-gooey goodness. Food arrived fresh and warm. Hash browns were just a bit dry but otherwise everything tasted fantastic.  My one drawback that dropped this spot down to 3 stars is the super slow service we experienced. Everything from getting the first cup of coffee, to the forgotten coffee creamer, to the 45-minute wait for eggs and subsequent delay for the check ended up turning a good meal to an overall lackluster experience.",

I did not know what to expect, so when we got there I was not so sure I wanted to stay... It seemed small and kind of plain... well it is very colorful, kind of retro... but the menu seemed kind of simple, few choices and a little overpriced (menu said omelette came with potatoes or bread) I had coffee and hubby had a diet coke.  Well, upon further review I liked that the omelette ingredients included asparagus. That was a nice surprise. So I went ahead and ordered an omelette with mushroom, asparagus.. and something else that I don't remember : ( I also chose sweet potato taters, and turns out it is potato AND bread. So over all it was a good meal, the only thing I don't like is that they are none of them close to home.  Hubby had omelette with sausage and jalapenos and he liked it a lot too.

Then there's the Ham steak with the red eye gravy. Now, my wife is a ham freak! The only complaint she had was that the ham steak was too Costco-ish. A nice piece of real smoked ham would have made the dish a lot better. The red-eye gravy makes an average slice of ham into a meal worth coming back for.",

Croatian breakfast loaf- delicious, frittata-like goodness (the winning recipe of a breakfast competition held by the restaurant).  I hope it stays on the menu!  Strawberries and creme waffle- also tasty- could have used a bit more strawberries and whipped cream Service was friendly and quick, with a bustling/buzzing atmosphere.  Delicious breakfast option!",

As there were three paying adults, any logical person would conclude that there are 3 paying customers.   Well Over Easy disagreed and made up an un-written policy that the owner refuses to split checks, and thus the vouchers now magically only apply 1 per table, despite them specifically stating, in writing, \"1 per customer per visit\".  My pregnant wife, being 8 months pregnant and generally tired, because she is pregnant , didn't feel like arguing with the staff about plainly written conditions on the voucher.    After only being able to use 1 voucher, I have since refunded the remaining vouchers from living social and will not frequent Over Easy ever again.    And i will mention to all my friends and family how they treated a pregnant lady.   Pregnant...",

Looking at the menu, I'm looking for unique specials and being a fan of hash browns, I went with the Wolfpack.  The food itself was nothing special.  Each individual element stands on its own - 2 eggs (I chose egg whites), bacon, cheese, and plenty of hash browns, but it was a filling meal.  I had the over easy ice so it was a nice cold coffee drink for the warm weather.  My friend had the crying pig omelette which seemed pretty good.  The decor was nice and staff was pretty nice.  Although our table was right next to another, I didn't feel like either of us were intruding upon each other.  Overall, a decent place and worth visiting again to try some of their other specialties.",

Considering the short hours there is always a wait for a table but both times I have gone the bar has been available straight away.  My first visit I was surprised at the not-so-trendy atmosphere. It is instead very whimsical and diner-y with a bright and childish twist. I ordered the banana pecan brioche french toast after reading about it in Phoenix Magazine (I think) and it was delicious! For the price I was expecting Texas toast or french bread as the base but it was regular ol' bread and it did just fine. I forget how filling breakfast foods are. I also got the iced coffee which was TASTY. It's cold brewed with cinnamon and mint and it is unique and refreshing. Plus, for the large glass you get at the right price you can't beat it.  Second time around I got an omelette with jalapeno, cheese, and onion (you can build your own) and it was the best omelette I've ever had. I typically do not eat eggs out places because I'm paranoid about undercooked eggs but I saw someone else's omelette whilst deciding what to order and it was browned to perfection just the way I like it. PERFECT. My boyfriend ordered their strawberry & rosemary lemonade and that was also really good.  I see a lot of comments saying the food is nothing special but I wouldn't quite put it that way. They serve typical breakfast foods but they tweak 'em with their own touch. Definitely worth a try for those who are teetering.",

I do love the sweet potato tots but not sure there's anything special about them. The portions are small and the prices seem a little high for what you get.   So far, my favorite thing I've tried has been the traditional eggs benedict (which is saying something, since i'm not typically a fan), but my friend I went with (who has a rather discerning (read: picky) palate and a culinary degree to back it up) said it wasn't that impressive. Today I had the chicken and waffles, and while good, I ended up with some stomach problems later that marred the experience.  The service at the counter was phenomenal the first time I went; the service in the dining room at a table not so much. I had to wait a while for coffee refills (and by the time we went today, the restaurant was not very busy - we went after 1pm) and the server just seemed sort of unprofessional as he walked around, interacting with patrons.  All-in-all, a good neighborhood breakfast spot, but not necessarily the best thing you'll ever have, either.",

I like that you could regularly go in and see people that represent all different parts of the PHX valley. You might have some hungover college kids on one side and a Suns player with his family on the other.   The coffee is good and strong, the food is always prepared as described and to your order. Plus its always nice to eat in a local place and see the owners walking around saying good morning, filling coffee cups and  calling patrons by name.   I also heard that they provided a free holiday meal for homeless folks. I am happy to support small local businesses, but I am even happier to support those that actively try to help others and better their communities.",

To drink I went with the strawberry lemonade with rosemary.  DELISH!    My friend had the Wolfpack Club.

We had to, but that's expected and we had no problem. Our order was taken quickly and drinks came out. My over easy iced was not as flavorful as in the past. Then our meal took almost an hour to come out. We were told sorry. I ordered the Florentine Benedict and it, too, was not nearly as flavorful as the past. Sloppy on the plate and thrown together. The sweet tots were good. We also ordered carmalized banana brioche French toast. From what I remember the portion looked much smaller, it looked like a half portion. We even asked. I am so sad, the food, experience and service was nothing like I remembered.",

    "text": "Meh....  What Over Easy has going for it is that it's breakfast options are HUGE.  This was a good place for us to try because our brunch crew has someone who doesn't eat eggs at breakfast.  We need other options (otherwise it's always bread/carbs for her).  So it was on the table.  We went at 10:30 on a Saturday morning.  For a group of 4, no wait.  First impression good.  As we continue to sit, we grow uncomfortable with the fact that it's still morning and we're listening to heavy metal.  It's just not breakfast music to us.  Order drinks.  Drinks take a bit.  When they do arrive, one of the iced coffees is dripping and the waiter drips it all down my husband's arm.  I had attempted to draw the dripping glass to his attention before the drink/sleeve interaction but alas, iced coffee on the arm.  And no apology, just a bunch of napkins tossed onto the table.  Now there's some crabbiness.  We order our food.  We do a little table rearrangements because of the tv distraction for some.  I had the wolfpack which was decent.  Nothing amazing.  My eggs were a little on the hard side, not how I prefer them.  Husband had the hopple popple and wasn't enthused.  BIL had breakfast burrito and was pleased but didn't like the single pancake (quote: tastes like bisquick).  BIL's girlfriend had carmelized banana french toast and sourdough toast.  The french toast was rich and the sourdough burnt.  Iced coffee tasted extremely watered down.  I prefer the toddy at gallo blanco or what I make at home.  Hot coffee did not impress.  We probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Big letdown. My husband and I came here with friends a few years back, and the food was mediocre at best. I didn't write my review then but it would've probably been a 3 star review, maximum.  Last month, we originally planned on going over to Central Bistro for brunch but it was Labor Day and they were closed. We called Over Easy and they were open, with little to no wait! We drove over and they had a \"Please Seat Yourselves\" sign at the front. There was another group of two waiting ahead of us. It took about ten minutes before we got seated, which was fine. We had a chance to figure out what we wanted to eat so when our server came by, we were ready to order. I ordered a breakfast burrito (potato, egg, cheese and some veggies) and my husband ordered a malted waffle. During the 45 minutes we waited for our food, we saw someone send back their food twice, another group waiting for their food (when it did end up coming, only half of their food came) for as long as us, and little to no food coming out of the kitchen. The busser was working his tail off and you could tell the servers were super busy, but we still waited almost an entire hour for a burrito and a waffle. Our server popped by twice to tell us our food was almost out but we still waited 10-15 minutes after it. She did thank us for our patience, which I appreciated, but if I hadn't been so hungry I would not have waited that long.  When our food finally came, my husband's waffle was ice cold. My burrito was obviously microwaved (the tortilla was hot and the eggs were steamy and almost watery) and was missing the potatoes. Our server asked us how everything was and we did let her know the waffle was cold - she offered to reheat it for us but again, we were starving and just wanted to eat.  I know this place has been on Diners, Drive Ins & Dives and usually those places are pretty delicious. I don't know if it's just gone downhill in the past few years, but with all the awesome brunch options out in our neighborhood (with more opening up) like Postino, Central Bistro, and Snooze, we won't be back to Over Easy.",

    "text": "Chef Aaron May is the force behind this restaurant, especially since it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. There are several locations, and this particular morning, we went to the location at 47th Street & Indian School.  Weekend mornings will find patrons waiting in line for a table at this local favorite. Why? I really have no idea. I had high hopes for this place because it's had rave reviews from local food critics, fellow Yelpers, been written up in magazines and on Triple D. But I was not impressed.  The coffee was good, not outstanding. The atmosphere was, well...odd. Nice if you like upside-down children's umbrellas.   The Mediterranean omelet (w/ spinach, tomato,  garlic & Feta) sounded good this particular morning. Wow - garlic should have been listed as the 1st ingredient - I like garlic but this was way too overpowering. The omelet itself was overcooked at the edges and since my taste buds were overwhelmed by the garlic, I can't really tell you if the omelet itself was flavorful. Big disappointment.  Crying Pig omelet was selected by a meat lover in our group. He said it was flavorful and had a fair amount of bacon & sausage. He thought the omelet was a bit overcooked, especially around the edges, and was a bit dry, too.  Not too many places have corned beef hash on the menu, so our friend jumped at the chance. He ordered it w/eggs AND a side of gravy. He absolutely loved it. Now, take that with a grain of salt as he always loves everything - but he was sincere in saying it was delicious so I believe him.  For a restaurant that specializes in breakfast fare, I expected more. Would I go back? Potentially. However there are so many other choices in the Valley that it may be a long time before I circle back.The waiter was friendly and made sure our waters and coffees were filled.",

A little overpriced and dishes were on the small side.  The ambiance was so-so.  About what you'd expect for a restaurant in a strip mall.  Service was fine.  Nothing really went wrong, but it just wasn't that special.  It wasn't the same restaurant as the one I visited at its previous home, and that's too bad.",

Strawberries and cream waffle - with this type of description you'd think you'd see strawberries and cream all over the waffle no? That's what I was hoping for when I ordered it. Instead I got a skirt of some whipped cream in the middle and a few sliced strawberries. They treated the strawberries and cream as if they were garnishes to the waffle I ordered instead of those two things being the highlight along with the waffle. The waffle was really thin, I was hoping to have a nice big Belgian style waffle. All in all, very underwhelming.   Gary's Croatian spinach loaf - it's actually what it sounds like - spinach in a loaf form. it came with a tiny side of a fruit bowl. Meh...  Tammy - egg whites with spinach, Swiss cheese, garlic and onion on an English muffin. This was good, nothing super special or original so it was hard to mess up. The hash browns they came with as a side were pretty decent.",

Pumpkin french toast was available (seasonal) and this was a dense breakfast treat, containing actual pumpkin seeds and nuts. It was almost like it already was pumpkin bread and then the french toast process started with the addition of bourbon. Either way, you only need a 1/2 order of this to satisfy. The best part perhaps was the bourbon/pumpkin syrup on the side - it really added an over-the-top flavor to the dish.     Also tried was the blueberry pancakes, which are not legendary, but do contain a bunch of blueberries. Better hotcakes are out there somewhere and hash browns were crispy, but too salty. Oh, I also enjoyed their Over Easy iced coffee drink - the touch of mint was interesting. We arrived at about 11:45 am on a Tuesday and the place was virtually empty. I guess this is the time to avoid those crowds.",

When I saw it on my plate, it resembled something that came out of a sick babys diaper.  The caramel sauce both smelled and tasted burned, it seemed that the bananas were cooked in with the sauce, but the pecans did seem to be in bite size pieces.  My mother opted for the Chilaquiles- a mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce chicken, sour cream &cheese served with 1 egg..any style***** Pure Deliciousness!!!!!!!!!! I sent back my mess of a plate for a half plate of plain ol' french toast and proceeded to take over her food!  If you go, get the Chilaquiles!!!!  You will not be disappointed!! Steer clear of the banana pecan french toast!!",

Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by.

I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.  I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now.

    "text": "The first thing we saw was a line of empty concrete benches outside the door and a  \"please wait to be seated sign\". There is a reason why the sign is outside - there is no room inside for waiting.  We're not sure if you're supposed to automatically park yourself on the benches or go inside first to sign in or what.   The interior feels like a 'pop-up' restaurant, where they went to a dollar store for supplies, others may find it unique or kitschy.    Since it was our first time here, in we went.  A few moments looking around for someone to catch our eye, a gentleman filling water glasses beckoned us to an empty table.  Since our placemat was our menu, we began looking for what to order.  A waitress came to our table a few moments later, and indicated she had a table of 3 and a two top would be available momentarily.  She used a lot of words, without actually saying she wanted us to vacate, and she certainly didn't indicate where we were supposed to vacate to.  When I ask if she was trying to say that the other waiter wasn't supposed to seat us and did she want us to move, she changed her mind and told us to forget about it.  I'm sorry, but this is incredibly poor hosting skills.  We ordered an omlette with mushrooms, onions, ham and american cheese, which came with a side of potatoes,  also ordered were the cheddar jalapeno biscuits with sausage gravy.  Let me say that I LOVE biscuits and gravy - but will only order them if them come with sausage gravy because I detest the flavor of wet flour that restaurants serve as \"country\" gravy.  What I got could in no way be considered sausage gravy - it was country gravy with a piece of a link added on top of a biscuit.  The concept of this is awesome, the reality is awful.  Thankfully my eating companion didn't find them as gross as I did and switched meals with me.  The omlette and potatoes\\american fries, were fine.  Between the rude reception from the waitress and the less than stellar food, we won't be returning.",

Unfortunately they had chopped the steak up into pieces and cooked it in some sort of gravy. It almost looked like dog food on his plate. That was super disappointing. My food turned out great, although the hash browns could've been cooked a little longer to be allowed time to crisp up.  The bathroom was also absolutely disgusting. I had to use the one across the hall because there was no saving it.  Clean the bathrooms and don't chop up a perfectly good steak and we might be back.",

There are locations through out the valley and I have had really good experiences at all of them, but I tend to go the Indian School location and the Tatum location the most frequent. Some of their best dishes that I enjoy are the Reese's Pieces Pancakes , the Protein Pancakes, and the Wolfpack. They have many other delicious dishes but these would rank among my favorites. Their pancakes are some of the most fluffy and flavorful pancakes you will ever have. I love Snooze and their cornucopia of pancakes, but when it comes to quality of the cake, I have to rate this place ahead of them.",

    "text": "Over Easy is a cute space bursting with light and pops of color tucked away in a shopping center plaza. The design of the restaurant is inviting and their various signage playing on the logo format adds a nice cohesiveness.   The menu has a lot of standard breakfast fare mixed with some more unique choices like waffle dogs and eggs benedict with avocado halves replacing the usual English muffin. I personally enjoyed their addition of creamy, fresh ricotta on the avocado toast. I also appreciated their use of local coffee roaster, Press.  The only downside? Having to see Guy Fieri's giant picture in the restaurant and emblazoned on the back of the servers' shirts. I get that a feature on Food Network is a cool accomplishment and a nice marketing point, but seeing his frosted tips first thing in the morning is never enjoyable.",

They taste great to boot! The avocado toast is perfect for a light breakfast. Nibbled on the boyfriends chicken and waffles. The batter for the chicken is seasoned well. They gave us hot sauce for the table so we could sauce crazy.   Second visit tried the chilaquiles. Huge portion. Enjoyed it as always, easy to please when it comes to chilaquiles.  My only request is the drink board be more accessible. The first time we visited we didn't know about any of the drink specials because we were tucked in the corner. Our server neglected to let us know. We'd happily spend more money on drinks if given the low down!",

Came here with my boyfriend last weekend for Sunday brunch and wowwwww it is tiny, cramped, and there is nowhere to wait inside for a table. That is, unless you want to stand in front of the door and hostess stand and have to shuffle constantly to let people in and out.  Also, it was 112 degrees outside and we literally felt NO AIR CONDITIONING inside! Whoa! Is that even legal in Arizona? What in sweltering sweat shop hell is going on here?  Our wait was advertised as 15-20 minutes but took more like 30 unfortunately. Had we known that, we likely would have just gone elsewhere.  It's a bummer because it's a cute place and the food is good.   I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delectable. Moist and soft in texture with just the right amount of lemony flavor. I loved them.  Boyfriend had the malted waffle which he enjoyed thoroughly!  We will definitely return to OverEasy...but only when winter comes and we don't mind waiting outside or feeling no AC when dining inside!",

They substitute the traditional hamburger with a brat burger. If you like rice, brats, mushroom gravy, and eggs then go for it. The omelets are great as well. Big and tasty. Normally I get the standard 2 egg breakfast. Make sure to the the Tater Tots. I'm not talking a out the sweet potato ones. They are good but the traditional potato ones are out of this world.",

    "text": "I'm tremendously disappointed with Over Easy. This is the type of breakfast dive (even featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives) that I'm usually in love with. I've heard such good things, but thanks to less than stellar food and underwhelming service, Over Easy feels like it's quality is under medium.   With a free Tuesday morning and a $20 for $10 gift certificate from Local Dines (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2F%3Fref%3D19485&s=69a1a1431c979d06d7819b315842bea4640a3a14b91eea41c717e79a200f8c77\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/?ref=19485</a>), my girlfriend and I decided to skip the usual eggs and/or cereal breakfast, and give Over Easy a try.   My girlfriend ordered an omelet with chicken, peppers, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. First problem with the omelet; it wasn't an omelet. Omelets are supposed to be light, fluffy, and folded. This came out as just a big scramble. The next problem; they used raw onions instead of caramelized. She sent it back, and explained that she hates raw onions. When it came back, it was clearly obvious that the cook simply caramelized some onions and threw it in with the original omelet. So the raw onions she doesn't like were still in the alleged omelet. It also comes with potatoes on the side. The potatoes were pretty mushy, when they should have been crispy. She could've sent it back again, but what's the point? After just a couple bites, she gave up on it.  She also had an Over Easy Ice coffee. There was nothing special about this specialty coffee. Tasted like Folgers with cream and cinnamon. No taste from the cardamom and mint that was supposed to be in there.   I had the Selina. It's a breakfast burrito. Not bad, but not anything special. Again, the potatoes (which are inside the burrito) are mushy, so there is no texture to it. And none of the ingredients taste fresh, so it seemed like something I could've microwaved up from Fresh and Easy.   We also had the 1/2 order of Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast. I was truly expecting something mind blowing, and it was anything but. While it kind of tasted like a bananas foster, it also tasted like it could've used another minute on the griddle.   They had no problem taking the omelet off the check, but it took forever to get that check. We were also kind of surprised that a manager never came by to see how everything was after we sent food back. I left stuffed, but disappointed; my girlfriend left unhappy and hungry.  The tables being right on top of each other don't really help. We could easily see and hear that the other couple sitting behind us was also having issues with the food and service. It also probably isn't a good thing that the people next to us could hear us talk about how disappointed we were. An open kitchen probably isn't the brightest idea, either. We could see quite a few obvious healthcode violations.   With the Local Dines certificate, our total came to about $5 dollars with tip. That's pretty much the only way I'd recommend going to Over Easy.",

Well, muffins, because you get 3 mini's plus a small container of lemon curd (the best lemon curd around BY FAR). The muffins we guessed were a day old because of how dry they were. We sent one order back. My friend had the Wolfpack which he said was made with bagged hashbrowns, not fresh. Disappointed. I ordered the Chilaquiles, eggs over-easy. The menu says one egg but mine was served with 2. The eggs were cooked correctly but the cheddar cheese was only partially melted. The dish could be improved on in many ways. Serve the ranchero sauce on the side so the tortillas stay crispy (personal preference). Add raw onions and Avacado slices. Use chopped or shredded roasted chicken instead of the little pieces of dry, cubed chicken. Finally, liven up the sour cream with some lime. Just some thoughts. Either make this dish the Over Easy version of really good roasted chicken breakfast nachos OR a dry tortilla soup. Regardless, it needs to be something better than it is now. In fact, our whole meal needed to be better. (Except the lemon curd)",

We get inside, sit down,  wait, wait, wait, try to get a servers attention, no luck, wait, wait, and wait. After 20 minutes we get up and leave.  We tell the hostess that it would have been nice to have service.  She did respond with an apology, but immediately looked at a patron waiting for a table and said \"looks like you got yourself a table.\"  That totally just negated her apology and shows that they just don't care if they burn through people, they have more customers.",

She started crossing names off making negative comments about them. Finally got to our table and ordered our food. Forgot to order coffee and some toast, so we waived the waiter to come back and attempted to order brioche toast and coffee. The waiter wasn't listening and appeared confused. When trying to explain what we wanted he very rudely said \"I am just asking questions, no need to roll your eyes\". Attempted again to explain what we wanted and ordered the coffee. We were so stunned by his comment it took us a few minutes to react. We got up and told another waiter we were leaving because our waiter was so rude. We asked for a manager and found out our waiter was the manager. Will never go back. With so many restaurants in Phoenix, there is no need to go somewhere and be treated this way.  S.",

I unfortunately was not greeted by the jolly chef I saw on TV, but I was greeted by what I presume to be the same breakfast dishes he inspired. It was an interestingly unique atmosphere with good service and great food! It was very busy and did take us a little while to be seated but my girlfriend and I eventually found our way inside and had a good experience.  Keep singing,  -Jerron",

    "text": "First off I am not a breakfast person, I prefer to sleep in vs getting up earlier to eat and I've never been a big fan of the typical breakfast foods. But I will say after making a stop to visit some friends in Arizona I was pleasantly surprised by this place.   My friend had heard about this place so we decided to give it a try. Like others have said expect a wait, there were only two of us and we got there around 9ish and had to wait maybe 15-20min. Not too bad but it was already quite warm outside and they don't have much of a waiting area inside, especially to accommodate all of us waiting to be seated. Once seated though we glanced over the menu trying to decide what to get. At a place called over easy you'd think we would've gotten some sort of egg dish, but we didn't. I got the reese's pancakes and my friend got one of their breakfast sandwiches the Loretta I believe.   We both agreed that our food was good but nothing notable or spectacular, we like the feel even though the decor seemed a bit random and we couldn't figure out what they were trying to go with. I wouldn't mind going back to try something else but again I don't necessarily need a return visit. I think if you went here you wouldn't be completely disappointed as long as you didn't go in expecting the best breakfast you can find. The service was ok but they definitely could've done better, we were at least asked multiple times by various staff members if our meal was ok etc. but no one cleared our table, we had three people ask if we were ok before someone thought to take our finished plates or even ask if we were finished. Again overall not a horrible experience or anything but not the best either",

My last visit, on Father's Day 2011, was less than impressive. It was busy, but no busier than any other weekend morning.  Hostess - seemed new and unfamiliar: told us our wait was 20 mins max; we ended up waiting over 45 mins Not to mention you wait outside with no misters, water or coffee. Uncomfortable!  Server - unattentive: she did not write down our order, which could be quite impressive...if she remembered the order correctly. I ordered the waffle dogs with a side of bacon. What came out was a waffle with bacon. Ummm...no thanks, not what I ordered. No apology or any course of making it better while I waited. Instead my guest ate his Wolfpack since it would have gotten cold otherwise.  Our coffee and water went empty without refills. In fact, I flagged down another server and asked for refills.  Manager - lip service but never asked how our meal was, if everything was ok...just talked in baby talk to my 10 mo old son.  Overall...NOT IMPRESSED and not going back. This, is OFF MY BREAKFAST LIST FOREVER.",

Well, we arrive and it's packed, 15 minute wait. Good sign right? Well no. It was a bad exp.  it took them 15 minutes to get us water and coffee. It took 30 minutes to get our food and 20 minutes to get toast which I ordered in my first order. My wife said her fork and food smelled like a sneeze and the guy sitting next to us sent his food back. He had the hash. I had the country fried steak and it was bland. No salt or nothing. My wife had the omelette and she said it tasted like fake fluffy school cafeteria egg. And it had an M&m in it. A blue one! Wtf. Yea we won't be going back. Oh yea and they charge for refills.

Over easy is a small cute joint located in a shopping center plaza. I really like the teal/yellow color scheme. Very friendly and warm. It was busy this morning but we got seated upon walk in...  I ordered Water and Earl Grey tea and the tea came in a cute mini kettle :) It is good for this brisk morning If you know me, I love Corn Beef Hash So of course I see it on the menu and that is what I ordered... My meal was very satisfying :) It was nice and hot and the eggs were cooked perfectly over easy haha and the wheat toast was good  Omg but the Loko Moko really caught my eye...  It is a hamburger patty on top of white rice, covered with brown mushroom gravy, topped with two eggs and style and crispy fried onions. Totally sounds like something my grandmother makes for me I will have to get that on my next visit!",

This was a build-your-own benedict done right (something that hasn't quite been achieved at places such as The Breakfast Club.) I ordered a Country benedict ($9), sans eggs and sausage (I know, weird), with avocado, tomato slices and goat cheese instead. The whole thing was smothered in Hollandaise sauce and came with a massive side of hashbrowns, and it was truly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Thank you, Chef Aaron May, thank you. The fact you can add goat cheese to breakfast items delights me.  This was my first time at Over Easy, which has several locations throughout Arizona, and I was impressed with the friendly service and casual style coupled with the mouthwatering menu items, including a variety of pancakes and French toasts. Also, be sure to order a delicious Over Easy Ice coffee drink, made with cinnamon and mint ($3.25).",

I ended up paying for one pancake for my son, no hash browns, no eggs, the little bit of milk he got wasn't enough to help him out - he even told me he didn't like the food. When I  asked for a refill the waitress told me it's a $1 more, Already paying $6 for ONE pancake and a drink is HORRIBLE. I could get better service at Denny's! My meal was dry and VERY under seasoned and my girlfriends meal was terrible as well. Coffee served Luke warm/ tasted like dish water - I get you renovated the restaurant, but i felt put out. This was my first visit. The waitress was so distracted, on her phone/ talking to other people - It took 50 mins to get our food, 25 minutes for our check.She even mentioned the cook was new and was \"learning the menu\", Once a cook always a cook. I was thoroughly upset with the service i asked to talk to a manager and they refused to let me talk to any one higher up. They said no one was available. I would like a call back about this - Reluctantly, i paid for a meal that i felt was sub par by far, i felt i shouldn't have even paid for a meal or dining experience as this. The only reason we ate anything, was because we where too damn to go anywhere else.  I would like a refund for the meal if possible.",

The server I think I overheard her say her name is Amy was very sweet. I got the basic 2 eggs. Its hard to mess that up so it was good. I felt like the menu was very basic, nothing stood out to me as a must try.",

    "text": "Really went in with high hopes for this place. Hadn't ever been and I love a good brunch location.  Went around 1pm this Sunday and was sat next to the hostess stand to have the displeasure of the young, unprofessional hostess nearly the entire time. She made a constant gripe about not wanting to be there, squatting down, even asking us at one point, \"Why would you want breakfast at 1pm?\" All in all, the hostess made it very clear we were inconveniencing her by coming in to eat.  In addition, our bearded server had to make two attempts to get our drinks and only really came back to give is our checks - which, in his defense there were  two cuties at the bar (that had already been served) that he'd rather give his attention to. My boyfriend's beard wasn't as impressive as his and I skipped out on the heavy makeup - how could we compete, right? All in all, service-wise the place was uncomfortably poor.  Whatever, I still had some hope for the food. Ordered the chilequiles because it's a classic breakfast favorite of mine.  I'll almost always order it if it's on a menu of a place I've never tried before. Basically,  what I got was a plate of cheesy nachos with eggs on top. What the serious F?   The side of hashbrowns I ordered would have been great if I hadn't put their ketchup on it. Why oh why did I stray from the Chollula?! It's clear after opening their ketchup bottles and smelling that they hadn't cleaned them in a long while, if not ever. It smelled rotten and made me queezy knowing I used it on my hashbrowns.   At that point, the whole experience was ruined for me and I was more full of disappointment than their food. A hostess that shouldn't be in the food and bev industry, a server with other things on his mind, breakfast nachos mislead to be called Chilequiles, and ketchup bottles not cleaned since who knows when...no way am I going back.",

Hash-browns are my favorite breakfast side so it was nice to find a place that implemented that as a main breakfast course, and they did it quite well if I may say so myself!  I mean a hash-brown sandwich..... that is ingenious!!!!!  I also got the standard 2 egg breakfast- cooked over easy, with crispy hash-browns, regular bacon and wheat toast for a friend of mine and he absolutely enjoyed it and he's a picky fella when it comes to breakfast! Ohhhh.... btw did I mention I ordered this delivery??? Yeah! Through UberEATS and it was great because my food got here relatively quick compared to other food delivery places and on top of that the food STILL tasted flipping amazing!! No wet slimy hash-brows, no limp or over cooked bacon, no rubbery or over runny eggs, and best of all NO SOGGY TOAST!!!  I am never one to usually write reviews which is how I know this was more then a splendid experience for me! Over Easy, you guys definitely have my vote all day everyday and I most definitely can't wait to explore all the other savory foods you guys have cooking up in that kitchen!",

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the bar stools have GOT TO GO.  There is no place to put your feet, so you are dangling your legs from a round, puffy stool, making it impossible to sit and eat comfortably. I awkwardly spilled food on my lap twice because of it. Even if they kept the stools but added spots on the bar wall to rest your feet, that would be a huge improvement.",

I ordered the eggs with sirloin steak. Perhaps I did not read the menu in details; I thought I was getting a piece of sirloin steak with 3 eggs. In reality, it's diced sirloin steak. It's over cooked, chewy & tasteless. It's not good value for your money ($11). Won't go back there anytime soon !!",

It is really good - but I usually let the boyfriend order this and I order something smaller (like a half order of french toast).  Bacon is good - but can at times be a little greasy and not as crispy as I usually like.  The juices are always good.  Over a good breakfast place.",

We're only visiting Phoenix for a week and we've already eaten there twice and plan to one more time.  What really makes them stand out is the attention and care they put into the food.  Every dish seems to have just a hint of extra spice or subtle flavor that elevates it above standard breakfast fare.  This is not just grub thrown together.  We've found it to be not just one of the best breakfasts we've ver had, but a great meal, period. Freshly made corned beef hash that has the look and texture of canned, but with a phenomenally fresh taste and a smokey sweetness that is amazing.  Malt waffles that are delicately crisp but have a nutty subtext that will astound.  The best, and I mean BEST chicken-fried steak I've ever had, and I love CFS.  Again, it's the care.  Crisp and fresh batter that has the texture and flavor of great fried chicken.  A wonderful sauce that has a spice you can't quite place but makes it unique.   Only beef:  The pastries (we tried the blueberry muffins and the cinnamon roll) are obviously brought in and were waaaaaay overpriced and nowhere near up to the standards of the rest of the food.  Avoid the baked stuff. Next trip it's the biscuits and gravy...can't WAIT!",

It was pretty busy and looked cute, so we thought we were going to really enjoy it - we didn't.   We ordered a fruit plate from the children's menu for my granddaughter (who is almost two).  It consisted of a couple pices of banana, a few grapes - okay so far - but the other items, Granny Smith apple slices and grapefruit, seemed like odd choices of fruit for a child's palate - Violet agreed.      My daughter's blueberry pancakes tasted sort of like they were made from a corn batter.  She said she wasn't expecting \"johnny-cakes\".   And the  blueberries were all in the middle of the pancakes, like they had been spooned onto the pancakes after they were already on the griddle instead of mixed into the batter.    My feta, spinach, tomato and garlic omelet was okay.  It would have been better if there had been more then a teaspoon of spinach and a teaspoon of feta, however.    I am a server myself, and my opinion of the service is that it was minimal at best.    Was it awful?  No.  Would we return? No",

My wife ordered the Pumpkin French Toast with a Mediterranean omlet. I had the Denver omlet and a belgian waffle. We also had an order of the Blueberry muffins. OMG!!!!! Everything was so fresh, the muffins were so gooey and has so many blueberries - Yummy!!!!! The omlets were awesome mine had so many fresh vegetables it was Yummy!!!!! The Pumpkin French Toast was freshly made and Yummy!!!! The waffle was good but the maple syrup made them Yummy!!!!! EVERYTHING was amazing... from the fact that the owner was there and took the time to talk with us made us feel welcomed and like part of the family.  Highly recommend it!!!!!

We just ate breakfast there. I got the 3 eggs over easy with mushrooms. The eggs were way too raw. I told the server about it and I asked to just get 2 eggs over easy instead of remaking the dish as the kid in the table was getting grumpy. That's what I ate for breakfast. The server didn't take it off the bill. I wouldn't say anything about it but I didn't get to eat the dish I wanted but still got to pay for it. Not cool. The Ppllo Loco is great !  Hopefully this is a one time issue and the owners are still on top of everything like they used to be.",

    "text": "My friends and I went to Over Easy for breakfast on Sunday. We had a friendly greeting and a brief wait. The majority of their restaurant is an enclosed outdoor patio. They had fans blasting, but we were in the mood for A/C so we sat inside. The waitress told us they are moving down the street in September so they'll have added space and a lunch menu.   Our table got the half order of the caramel banana french toast as an appetizer - appetizers at breakfast? Why not? The dish was delicious! I couldn't have eaten a whole plate, but sharing it was perfect. The nuts, banana and caramel toppings were a great combo to top nice, thick slices of french toast.   I ordered The Dolly sandwich - It was pretty basic (English muffin sandwich with scrambled egg, cheddar cheese, bacon, and tomato). I was in a simple mood, but I was a worried I'd pretty much just ordered an Egg McMuffin. It was definitely not a McMuffin. The english muffin was crispy, the eggs were fluffy, real melted cheddar cheese, and the bacon was crispy just as I requested. I got a side of sweet potato tater tots - why haven't I ever seen these before? What a great concept!     When in the area, I'd definitely have breakfast here again.",

The gravy had large chunks of meat, sausages and bacon in it!  It was very hearty and delicious!!  The Waffle dog was like a corndog, but better!  And it was served with a chili maple syrup... YUM!!  The brioche french toast w/ bananas and walnuts was another home run!!  The place was very clean with a great server who was very attentive and offered great suggestions!  Overall experience was excellent!!  I can't wait to take another trip to Arizona to eat their food!",

    "text": "While visiting a friend in Phoenix during Thanksgiving week, my dining companion and I sought out Over Easy.  I love me my breakfasts and I've heard they are exceptionally good.  Note:  This was on a Tuesday.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak.  The breading was crispy and flavorful ... it tasted just like the well-seasoned breading on a piece of fried chicken.  On top of it was a dollop of white gravy.  I liked that it was not smothered in gravy as you see on so many chicken fried steaks you might get elsewhere.  And on top of that were my over-easy eggs, accompanied by the home fries on the side.  My dining companion had the Brioche French Toast with caramelized bananas.  It was good, but when he tasted my Chicken Fried steak, he ordered one for himself and we shared the remaining French Toast between us.  Now, this is where things get weird.  I was so enamored with the Chicken Fried Steak, we went back the next day (a Wednesday) and brought our host, a Phoenix resident, with us.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak again as did our host.  My companion tried the Fried Chicken & Waffles.  To my surprise and disappointment, this time the breading was not crisp at all.  It was kind of mushy.  And the flavor?  There was none.  It was bland and lacked seasoning.  It was like day and night.  However, in both instances, the service was friendly and prompt.    I'm still giving this place 4 stars based on my first experience.  I'm hoping that they just had a bad day on Wednesday.",

Anyways, my cousin goes to ASU, so I called her up and had her get me for breakfast since I had a ton of time to kill.  She takes me to this little tiny place called Over Easy. Yay, it looks cute. It also looks like (by looking at the building) it used to be a Taco Bell back in the day. Ah oh!  WHO KNEW THERE WAS GOOD FOOD IN ARIZONA!? I actually liked the 'Over Easy' entree that I got. Filled me up and while it wasn't gourmet or anything, it was the next best thing. Also, it's helpful to mention that there is nothing on the menu over 10.00 - nothing. All you ASU kids should eat here.  Finally, the crappy thing about running a business in the middle of an Arizona desert is that you're sometimes gonna get some Arizona desert clientele. Let me just say that the service is amazing. EVEN THOUGH there were some genuine straight from the trailer park douchebags in there. Had to say it. I love you Over Easy.",

The thing about a place like this is that it's all about the food. I wouldn't say it s the greatest thing I've ever had, but it is much better than the chain restaurants. The food has the taste of homemade to it. The waffles and pancakes have a lightness to it that you can't seem to get in chain restaurants or from the supermarket. They have real maple syrup and the taste just can't be duplicated. The chicken that came with the chicken and waffles was not very seasoned, which I liked, but others may not if they are expecting a ton of flavor from it.  Overall, I'd like to give it a 3.5 but will round up to a 4. I'd go again every once in a while but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular.",

    "text": "A good weekend breakfast can make or break my day so I'm happy that we weren't disappointed when we chose Over Easy as our Brunch Day spot a few weekends ago. Like any good yelper, I did my research and read the mixed reviews as well as OE's claim to fame via Guy Fieri's Food Network visit. And, again, like any good yelper, I decided to give it a try with an open mind - not expecting too much or too little - just a new experience that we hope we would end up enjoying.  And enjoy we did. We had a late start that morning since guests were in town so we made it there about 12:30ish - kind of late for brunch, I know, but brekky food is good at any time of day so who cares, right? We did have to wait about 20 minutes because the place was busy and on the smaller side. No big deal because there is ample seating outdoors to wait and the hostess cheerfully checked on us twice to let us know how much longer it would be.   Once seated we quickly perused the easy to read menu and made our choices. Our table of four was able to test the Chilaquiles, Chicken & Waffles, an omelet plate and, of course, the Food Network famous Waffle Dogs. If our amazingly cleaned off plates weren't a giveaway that the food was good then I don't know what else to say. Our only disappointment was that our server forgot to place our order for the Waffle Dogs which our table had hoped to share as our appetizer. We were able to remind him and they immediately cooked them up for us but by then we had already finished our meals so we had them pack the waffle dogs into a container to go. We enjoyed them at home a few hours later and they were delicious - I can only imagine how great they would have been nice and fresh!  Fun food, cute decor and a nice location with ample parking makes OE a good go to choice for any future Brunch Days.",

    "text": "Maybe my favorite \"Breakfast Place\" in Phoenix.  My general \"rule of thumb\" is to NOT give good or great ratings until I have been several times. I have been here so often that I have had many of the menu items, from the very simple to the unique and original and have seldom been disappointed. The exception is the Corned Beef Hash. A different take on that traditional, as are many of the \"Specialties,\" but just NOT hearty enough for me and the portion, much unlike most everything else, was fairly skimpy.  Bacon to die for, eggs always as requested, toast and hash browns are excellent and the service is always fast and courteous. That being said, I am not at all certain what other Reviewers experienced when they give this little place a less than stellar review.  Never did for lunch, but Breakfast is a winner!",

    "text": "Had to try out this breakfast place featured on triple D quite a while ago.  One of us loves breakfast, the other would prefer to starve until lunch or brunch at the very least.  Another casual trip for us and hence Yelp review.     Lets just start out saying it was mixed as far as what was expected.  Food was across the board fantastic.  Absolutely no wait to get in.  We had hoped the day after Labor Day might be uncrowded.  Surprised to find many families with babies and absolutely no foodies.     Had the Home made Hash and eggs.  Eggs done as ordered, Hash very good.  Also had Ham steak- there seems to be a slight Hawaiian influence here.  Processed ham roll but done right with a mildly sweet sauce on top.  The Carmel Banana pecan French toast is a must, though I hate nuts on/in my sweats.  They could be easily left off, just ask.  Special Pumpkin French toast was good but really screams for a big ole scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  I took an order home.  The razzcherry scone was tasty as scones go.      For Breakfast, I've got to admit that this place was excellent.  Anytime she wants to get up early to eat, I'll agree to this destination.  Just really glad there was not a 2 hour wait. Of coarse, then it would be lunch and I'd be somewhere else.  So win win I guess.      The over all gist of this place is a new generation hippie/environmental conscious foodie destination with mild Hawaiian overtones.  Surprised I found no Spam on the menu but I did say the Hawaiian influence is subtle.  If you come here don't just order eggs, bacon, toast and coffee and then say it was nothing special.  You will be commenting more on the diner than the restaurant.   $40 for all this plus two coffees.  Not bad at all.  My breakfast loving companion says, about average.",

The second time we went our server spent more time chatting with some one sitting at the bar than refilling our coffee which was unfortunate.  The other complaint I have is the sun shades on the windows are very dirty and covered in dried food. So I would avoid sitting at the widow facing tables if you can.  The rest of the resturant seemed fine if they do something about the shades.",

I didn't get a coffee refill until I asked for the check.   I ordered the Wolf Pack, which is two eggs sandwhiched between hashbrowns with bacon and cheese.  My hashbrowns were a little undercooked, and I really don't like soggy hashbrowns. Other than that, it was delicious though.   My friend ordered the brioched french toast. When she asked our waitress what 'brioched' meant, the waitress told us it was just normal french toast... that really did not impress me. My friend said it was absolutely delicious though, some of the best french toast she's ever had.   I'll try this place again, since it's so close to home,  and its possible I just visited on an off day.  It's a tad dissapointing after visiting valley greats like Matt's Big Breakfast. Over-easy could be Arcadia's version of Matt's, with some work.   Plan on waiting for at least 15-20 minutes, as this place is PACKED. I went there at 8:30 on a Saturday morning and it was totally full and there was already a wait!",

We were seated promptly, given some ice water, and then began the 15 minutes of trying to flag down a waiter. We were told our waiter would be with us soon. Finally, the other waiter just took our order and we were a little confused why the our waiter was MIA.   Now we waited another 30 minutes for our food to arrive... I was ready to bail but felt too committed at this point. The table next us hadn't even received their food and they were there before us. We could see that people who had arrived after us had gotten there's and it was beyond frustrating. Luckily the food came out hot and was good. The waffle dogs were not really crispy but overall an indulgent treat. The Tammy egg white sandwich was great along with the sweet pot tots. The waiter was very apologetic and told us some excuses why service was so slow and bad, and that it wasn't normally this way. He was a nice guy in a bad situation so we understood. Management needs to step in a make sure that huge take out orders don't slow down service and the kitchen. We left full but disappointed . Also, the table next to us just got their food as we were leaving And had to send it back cause it was cold (they had the MIA clueless waiter).",

The move to the new location made a HUGE difference.   My old review  was 3 stars - I met girlfriends for breakfast here last weekend.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it.  I didn't really think much of it either way.  I probably would not suggest going here again but would go if someone else invited me.  The food was okay and has some untraditional & interesting twists.  The wait was very long.",

Thank you Steve Jobs for my IPhone) Once we got to the restaurant it was nice and brright inside which I like in the morning. They have Cow umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The place has an awesome vibe. I would and did spread the word of this nice find to another party in from LA that this place was here as an FYI. They night be slow on refills as stated but I would rather ask for my refill, which was pleasantly poured with a simple \"yes and a smile\" and have excellent CS! Great menu, had a hard time choosing. Both meals were delicious. My BF had this egg bennie over french toast under Spinach which he loved. I was traditional with eggs and bacon. An older gentleman went to each guest and asked how everything was assuming he was the owner! It was five star for me!! Great staff!!!!",

    "text": "I have to jump off the Over Easy bandwagon unfortunately. I have eaten there a few times now and it just occurred to me today that I never (and I mean never) have good service. I can make a good breakfast myself if need be and save some scratch.  I go out to eat for fresh hot food and great service. Today my friend and I received neither.   Upon arrival we sat immediately since we arrived before 8. We were \"greeted\" by a server In about 1 min and asked if we were ready to order.  I stated we were not but drinks would be great.  We got our coffee within a few mins (which tasted fine). After that no sign of our server for 10 mins or so.  The table next to us was also looking to order from our MIA waitress.  She finally came over and took our order in a fast and courteous manner. The food arrived in about 15 mins but there was a problem......my friend's biscuits n gravy were barely room temperature.  After attempting to flag down the waitress for a few mins she walked by holding up her finger to let me know to wait min.  I don't know if she was being rude but it came across that way. After telling her the problem there was no apology and she walked away with his plate returning about 10 mins later with a hot plate of food. The food itself was good, but not great in any way. Our coffee cups went empty for long stretches of time and our waffle dogs had no crunch to them whatsoever.  After all that they give me the wrong bill which was about 5 bucks short of what we spent. After running my card they came back and asked for my card again and took about 15 mins to redo the bill and charge us 5 buck more. After the poor quality service I would figure they just let it slide since they made the mistake anyway and it was 5 bucks and not 20.   I feel that there are many places that match the quality of the food at Over Easy and have much better service.  I will no longer eat there.",

    "text": "I had been waiting forever to try this place.  OK, I will  admit it.  I couldn't get my late night butt out of bed early enough to get there!  That's what happens when you work nights in the restaurant biz!  After dropping family off at the airport at the crack of dawn we decided to make our way to Over Easy.  We realized by the clever billboard stating we had basically made a wrong turn and the restaurant was in the opposite direction.  Side note:  I work at Roka Akor and Chef-Owner, Aaron May was in the restaurant last night. I told him that we made it over to his place and loved the \"strategically placed\" billboard and that we loved the food and atmosphere too.   My boyfriend Ben, best friend Sabrina and I made our way into the restaurant.  I immediately loved the cozy feel and cheerful color and design of the interior.  The snazzy bar stools were tempting to bounce up and down like a little kid.  We took our place to a table by the door.  I love the diner feel and the buzz of guests conversation.  Our waitress was cheerful and busy but her back up girl looked like she was missing her warm bed she had to get out of on this morning.  I guess that's why I am the Night Girl.  It was also nice to be able to see the kitchen crew working well together preparing dishes left and right to the hungry diners.    Great selections on the menu with classic breakfast comfort food.  Ben chose the 3 eggs with steak, caramelized onions and chilies.  Sabrina chose the Wolf Pack: 2 eggs, bacon and cheese between layers of hash browns. Yeah, OMG!  I decided on the Lox, Eggs and Onions with choice of potatoes and toast.  I chose the sourdough.   I need to wrap this up because now I am STARVING!  I decided on the lox because it is one of my all time favorite things.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes to the point it was a little embarrassing because we did everything to the plate but pick it up and lick the death out of it!     All I can say is I can't wait to get my tired, lazy butt out of bed early enough to work my way through the menu.  I think I will definitely indulge in the pancakes or french toast.  OMG, there I go again!  I need to EAT!!!!  Thanks Aaron!!!!!  LVUMNIT!",

Was a frequent customer at the old location on 40th Street (old Taco Bell), so thought I'd try their new space at 48th St & Indian School in a grocery anchored center - BORING.  No personality and what's worse is it seemed that along with the change in location there's been a change in attitude.    We walked in and stood inside the door, tables were open - there were a couple of people ahead of us, just standing there and talking.    After about 3 or 4 minutes (generally, not a long time) except when you are being ignored.  Finally, one of the other waiting customers (I thought)  asked us, \"Just you two?\".  They were EMPLOYEES!!  Should have left then, but my prior positive experience with Over Easy gave me reason enough to stay for the food.  Not a smart decision.  We sat down and were, again, ignored!  We did get water, but none of the servers came by to greet us, take an order, ask a question, anything until we stopped someone and asked them to find our server.  Finally put in an order, which of course, came out wrong.  Either the server didn't write the order correctly or the cooks can't read.  In any event, no one bothered to check if what they delivered was as ordered.  They've lost the panache and the desire to impress their customers with good service and good food.  Won't be returning.  Too bad, good breakfast places are hard to find.",

Although the place was packed, the wait was relatively short (~10 mins).  They sat us in a corner of the restaurant behind some sort of partition.  As my friend put it, \"it's like sitting at the kids' table.\"  Our area, with 4 tables, is sort of separated from the rest of the restaurant.  Although a little strange, at least it was quieter.  They pack so many tables in the room that I think it may be a fire hazard.   Either way, I ignored the thought of a flaming death and went on to enjoy my food.  The waffle dogs are actually very good.  It's not greasy at all.  The batter had good flavor and the sausage was not too salty or greasy.  The sauce brought just the right amount of sweetness.  Overall, a very balanced dish.  My friend's caramelized banana french toast looked awesome, while my corned beef hash with eggs was also very nicely done.  I would probably prefer a little more corned beef and a little less potato in the dish though.    Overall, I will be back for more breakfast goodness.",

Considering that it was a Sunday morning, I didn't mind the 20-25 minute wait.  I figured that it will be all worth it!  For my drink, I was torn between the lemonade with mint and the raspberry lemonade with rosemary so I asked to try both.  I chose the second one but didn't really end up liking it that much.  After a few sips I felt like the flavors didn't really blend too well.  The rosemary was overwhelming.  I took it home and took a while to finish the whole thing.  I drank water during breakfast instead.    I picked the house made corned beef hash which came with 2 eggs and a toasted sourdough.  Corned beef was fresh!! - out of the can!.. the best part of my meal was the egg made over easy!  and the bread was good but Matt's big breakfast sourdough bread is better.  The bf ordered the chicken fried steak which came with a waffle.  He was just equally disappointed..    Service was good and the place was trendy (although tiny).  But other than the hype that was caused by Guy from food network, I don't think this place lives up to it.  Not really worth checking out, I'd rather go to Matt's.",

Ebony, our server, made the experience as pleasant as it could have possibly been, despite us holding the table for 45 minutes before even ordering. Our crew was boisterous and fun, and she encouraged all of our ridiculous banter! Her recommendations were on point, however, given the quality of all the menu items, that wasn't too difficult. Every dish was prepared perfectly; we ordered the cheddar jalapeno biscuits and gravy to share; I ordered the protein bowl with chicken and avocado (with Ebony's help), and was NOT disappointed! Other choices included the chicken and waffles, which were great even though it's not really my style; the Chilaquiles, hearty and delicious; lemon ricotta pancakes- SO GOOD!; the Florentine Benedict which I didn't try, but the feedback was stellar; and a highly customized \"The Over Easy\" for my ridiculously picky uncle, which was received incredibly well. This place, and it's staff, did absolutely everything correctly, and I can't wait to go back again. This will definitely be our new brunch spot when I'm in town.   Thank you for being so wonderful, Ebony and colleagues!",

(I have had the same waitress every time, and I wish I could remember her name-she knows the menu inside and out, makes great recommendations, is super sweet and attentive.  Next time I go, I'll be sure to remember her name and update my review.) Their mimosas are pretty strong and come in pint-size glasses! All of the portion sizes of the dishes I have had are pretty large, I always have enough for a second meal.  I usually order the chicken and waffles.  My boyfriend has gotten the chicken fried steak, egg breakfast, and waffle dogs (breakfast sausages on a stick, fried in waffle batter -delicious!).   My only suggestion would be to have more of a selection of coffee drinks - lattes, macchiatos, etc. But overall, great breakfast spot!",

And there on the Wall was a mural of Guy himself! Lemon ricotta pancakes where light and very lemony. The over easy was super with lots of bacon. The French toast with the caramelized bananas and nuts was a little too sweet for my son but if you like sweet it's good. Very friendly waitress who gave us some tourist tips. Glad we came here!",

The waffle was malty, the boneless chicken was fried crispy and succulent. The real maple syrup had a touch of hot sauce in it and bound the whole thing together. We got a side of the jalapeno-infused biscuits and gravy, and I almost need a moment of silence before proceeding. It was lights out good. If I lived in Phoenix, I would be here 3 times a week!",

This trip, I had pancakes which came out luke warm and were so gummy and thick that I left more on the plate than I'd wished! Also, my syrup was cold / room temp. (Which didn't help the temperature of my pancakes.)   I didn't bother to ask for a refill on my coffee either. I don't think one should ever have to ask their server for a refill.   With five customers and three servers behind the bar, I also expected a 'Goodbye' when leaving.. no such luck.

It tasted good though. Hash browns were good. Next time I will try something other than an egg dish. I believe in giving most places a second chance. One more thing; my waiter couldn't count change.

It was meant to be.  With a menu that made me salivate with every description, I was torn. Our server insisted that their benedicts were out of this world. This guy was right. Chris went with the Country Benedict- cheddar jalapeno infused biscuits with juicy sausage patties, flawlessly poached eggs, and a house made Hollandaise that swooned. I don't know what had gotten into me on this day, but I went with Over Easy's Traditional Benedict. I practically licked my plate clean. Perfection.

The eggs were cooked perfectly and the tater tots were delicious haha. The country fried steak was a bit tougher than I like.   The French toast was pretty dang good, and I'm not a big French toast fan. We also got the caramelized bananas and pecans on the side so we could try with and without. Wouldn't add them on next time.  The Chilaquiles were tasty, but the overall flavor was kinda close to Nacho Doritos.  I will definitely be back to try more and see if I can find that perfect meal here.",

The whites of my eggs were runny even though I had asked for over medium and the chicken fried steak was overcooked so it the crust was hard. The sweet potato tots were mushy and lacked flavor at all. Our entire party was very disappointed.",

We decided to switch up our brunch routine and landed on Over Easy because it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. They have an extensive menu, so there's a crazy amount of options, especially for breakfast. I ended up getting the caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast and my girlfriend ordered the Chilaquiles.   The food was good, but came in small portions and was a bit pricey for how much we got. After really looking forward to eating here, it's safe to say we were underwhelmed.  Given how busy the place was and how much praise it gets, we just didn't get what the fuss was about. Maybe they're resting on their laurels after receiving national attention.  I wouldn't avoid it, but there's plenty of other places to grab brunch. I doubt we'll be back.",

I had such high hopes for this place, I mean the only thing better than breakfast in my book is MAGIC and well there wasn't a whole lot of that coming from my meal. I ordered steak and eggs (a classic) which was like 7 or 8 bucks (in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch), but instincts aside I was still hyped, sadly like most things in my life disappointment:)  The \"Steak\" basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs, my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross, the coffee drink was good (kinda girly) and the decor was aiight.   So if you find yourself waking up sunday morning smelling like crown royal and cigarettes with someone you barely know and never want to know again take them here.

I didn't like how I was practically sitting on the people next to me because of how many tables they are trying to cram in that place.  I had a traditional eggs, sausage, and hash browns with toast-and for $7.50 I was highly disappointed in the portion. It was weeeeeak, nothing like a real diner would serve.

    "text": "First of all, I used to go to the Taco Bell 10 years ago before going down the street to my high school math tutor. I am amazed with how they changed the building into a quaint, unique little local breakfast eatery. I went today with a friend of mine as breakfast isn't a usual meal that I go out for, but since I've been wanting to try the restaurant I made an effort to make it there before its early closing time of 11:30am.   Being a graphic designer, everything about the place is simple and what I thought, delicious. I ordered an iced coffee, although I wish they would have had a Chai Tea on the menu, and the Loretta which is one of their breakfast sandwiches. Not to mention the sweet potato tatter tots as a side. Both were very delicious especially with adding the famous Chulula sauce on the sandwich and a bit of ketchup to the tots. I wish the bread on my sandwich was a bit more crispy so it wouldn't get soggy as quickly as it did, but the taste was great. If you are looking for a local Phoenix breakfast, for sure check out Over Easy. I would definitely go back, however the seating is mostly outdoors. Perhaps not a great spot during the hot Phoenix summer months, but I can definitely see myself there once it starts getting cooler out!  I am sure this place gets pretty packed during the weekend. I would say going during the week during the later part of the morning will allow you to miss the high traffic. Speaking of traffic, the traffic noise is a bit much if you're outside. I, however, was able to tune it out for the most part. I think they should have put the patio more in the back, but such is life!",

Some may say a good dichotomy, but I disagree. I will say that my dining partner delighted in the wild mushroom and herb eggs and strawberry lemonade.   I had to use the bathroom, which happens to be located out around the back. Think any one of the \"____bertos\" Mexican places, and you will pick up what I am laying down. However, I was surprised at the cleanliness despite the fact that I had to use the men's restroom because the W's was occupied.   Overall, the place is cute. Quite cute. However, because cute generally infers small, I was left smelling like sizzling bacon all day.

The eggs also were not very good, I got scrambled eggs with about 2 pounds of mushrooms on top. You could tell the mushrooms they used had been dehydrated, they were rubbery and had no flavor.

I ordered the caramelized banana and pecan french toast, one of the items that Over Easy is known for, with a side order of bacon and coffee to drink. The coffee was excellent. That's the good news. The bacon was way overcooked and I did mention it to the wait staff (she took it off our bill). The bananas were more like plantains, almost crunchy and not to my liking. The sauce didn't quite hit the right amount of sweetness; it fell ever so short of delicious. The bread itself was very good and I would try regular french toast there again. My dining mate's eggs were ordered over medium and they arrived over easy. She did, though, request a substitution of sausage patties and they accommodated her without a second thought. Her English muffin was perfectly toasted and her dessert of English muffin, jelly, and sausage was amazing.   Overall, my first visit to Over Easy a couple years ago was much more satisfying than this one, so I will try them again. Our server was fine and met our requests with a smile. They were not very busy when we were there and that may be the reason for overdone bacon, but the bananas were definitely \"off.\"",

No, it's not artsy like my beloved Pallette, but you can't beat it for a quick, delicious and inexpensive start to your day.  Over Easy is absolutely adorable inside, and the enclosed patio with misters is nice too.  More than anything, though, I love bellying up to the counter and sitting on the bouncy stools.  While I'll be dragging poor Dave B here every weekend from now on, I also would have no problem popping in by myself on the way to work with a book.    The food was yum, just your typical breakfast cafe fare, but somehow a notch above.  The price are beyond reasonable (you can grab some eggs and bacon for less than your Egg McMuffin meal deal, seriously), and it's simple to put together exactly what you want, a la carte.   (EDITED NOTE:  after I posted this, I read other reviews, many complaining about price.  I guess I didn't really pay attention to the bigger items on the menu... I just know that I typically want some combination of pancake, toast, eggs, bacon, and potatoes, and I am able to get all that VERY cheaply a la carte)  Now that Over Easy exists, I can't imagine a good reason to ever set foot into anything generic like The Good Egg or First Watch again.  My one and only disappointment in Over Easy is that they are only open in the mornings.  Hopefully plans for some extended hours (maybe even just through lunch) are in the works.  If so, you can also look for me there every day at lunch too!",

Actually had to hail the host over to get it for us.  Mixed reviews for the food - the french toast with carmelized bananas and pecans was incredibly delicious, the toast so big and fluffy and tender, the bananas soft and fresh... but the \"three eggs with herbs and mushrooms\" was, well, I don't know - just not good, and probably should have been called \"an ungodly amount of slimy rubbery mushrooms dumped on top of some decent eggs with an herb, maybe two.\" What sounded cool when were ordering was the tater tot potato option, which sounds good in theory, but when it came down to it, was kind of weird. That could be just me, but these tots weren't even that good.  Would I come back? That's the real question, right? Yeah, probably. Not the first place on my list though.

The brioche was toasted on the outside but still had a \"fluffy\" center. The caramel sauce was terrific and the pecans were crunchy. LOVED this.  Next I had the jalapeno cheddar biscuits with sausage gravy. I did not care for the biscuits, they were kind of bland. I appreciated the huge chunks of sausage in the sausage gravy. I just wish it had more pepper, which was easy to remedy.  The corned beef hash was homemade. I am used to a chunkier hash, the corned beef in this hash was ground. It still had a good taste.  I will have to go back and try the waffle dogs and the cherry scones.",

    "text": "My husband and I are visiting from San Diego. We saw over easy on our fav food show. We are both in the service industry and feel that great service is just as important as great food. You work hard for the money your bringing in to spend but some how for some reason it seems over easy does not have service standards.  We are bummed because the food is great but bad service leaves bad taste. We got our food to go I called in for to go. The girl that answered was nice. My husband went to pick up. The hostess did say hi and welcome. She directed him to the bar to pick up our food there was a woman working behind the bar as he was walking up she looked at him grabbed a pitcher of water and began to walk around the restaurant ignoring him. after a couple minutes she walks up in knowledge is that he's there to pick up all of a sudden another man came out from the back and just handed him our food No, thank you no, is there anything else just our bill we felt they didn't want us there. he paid no words came out from the person who took his check.  when we got back to our hotel about 15 minutes away we start to open up our food and realize they left out the maple syrup that they pride themselves and making it just felt like over easy didn't care we ordered the chicken fried steak the Wolfpack in the waffle sausages that were on the Food Network show we were just surprised at the lack of care that went into our to go order I think we will avoid  this location and try a new one since you like the food!!! too bad",

    "text": "First off, let me say fantastic space, great patio, and I like the counter. They made great use of an old Taco Bell and parking is much better than Vig next door.  The owner was sitting next to us at the counter, or maybe the manager, but either way it made for a somewhat interesting meal. I was making observations to my mom, knowing the owner could hear me, with hopes that he might take note. First of all, the orange juice was not squeezed orange juice, but rather out of a bottle... thought you guys were trying to be an \"up market\" style place. The server then recommended the bacon saying it was the best in town and had an amazing flavor. Reall dude? really? I bought into your sales pitch, and thought nothing more of it than Denny's. My pancakes were great, and had no complaints there, but made the observation to mom, rather loudly, \"the fucking butter is hard, like a rock, I can't even use it!\" Owner didn't even look my way.   The kid who was the server behind the counter was also kind of a goon. I honestly believe they were on to something here, and ruined it with their management. The food is ok, the atmosphere is cool, but the service and attitude from everyone was lame.   I'll go back, if I'm starving and I'm in the neighborhood with no other options, but this is not a winner. I'll take Matt's, Pallatte, or even First Watch for that matter.",

She rushed us and was wrong about how my food was prepared (which was really annoying since i had to remove the toppings from my sandwich), and seemed annoyed that I was even asking her a question.  She was so off-putting that we weren't even comfortable asking her for refills on our drinks (not that she ever came by to ask how we were doing). The other servers were nice and the manager (owner?) came to ask how we were, fortunately.  The food was OK.  I got a Loretta sandwich (had to remove the peppers since I don't like them raw, which is what I asked the waitress about). Tried the brioche french toast and that was good.  My fiancee wasn't too excited about the corned beef hash, which is sad because he loves it.  He said it tasted canned with some added onion.  Overall, I'd never go back.  Much better options in the neighborhood.",

Felt like I was eating plastic, tasted like it too, eggs were rubbery & only two small strips of bacon.  My companions chicken fried steak wasn't bad, though they forgot to bring his side of corn beef hash, proceed to bring him hash browns and then the corn beef hash...  He was done with his food before they brought either of them out!  The gentleman in the back putting butter in the pans wasn't wearing gloves (the other cooks were) and picks up a piece of butter he dropped, yip, with his hands.  Our server sits at the bar near us & inhales his food, quite a sight!  No one asked how our meal was.  He brings us our check, my full plate of food is sitting right there, still doesn't ask us about our meal.  We ask for a to go box, my companion looks inside and it's got an oil puddle and oops, some MORE hair!!!  We pay and run out of there!  I personally am too afraid of going back there in the fear of I might 'catch' something but then again maybe it was a combination of my bad luck and a bad day for them...?",

I had an egg white omelet w/ wild mushrooms and hashbrowns and my dining companion had a different egg dish w/, get this, a side of Recess Pieces pancakes (yes, I had a bite and yes, they were really yummy)!

So we seat our selves wondering for 5 minutes wether the waitress had seen us sitting there. Finally she comes and we ask for waters and tell her we will be ready to order in a couple minutes. Ten minutes later she finally comes to take our order. I ordered the chicken and waffles. We got our food in a decent amount of time. So we wait 8 minutes hoping someone will get us some lemonade and milk. I see one of the workers walk by and ask him for a lemonade and milk he didn't seem to speak english. I asked him because he works there and he had been bringing out drinks. So I watch as he doesn't go to get our drinks but wanders around wiping off tables and such. Finally I wave down the waitress and order their lemonade and milk. The lemonade has mint in it making it taste like crap. I watch an elderly couple come in and seat themselves next to us. They saw me complain that the mexican guy never got our drinks. They wait to be helped for 8 minutes and say why the heck are we here if no one is going to help us. The chicken waffles was hit or miss. The chicken had a crust that didn't taste like fried chicken. The waffles tasted good but the chicken didn't. The waitress gave us our check and gave the obvious thank you so much please tip me. I tipped her too well for such a crappy sitting. I recommend never visiting this restaurant. I drove 45 minutes hoping that this would be better than the usual Ihop but it wasn't.",

    "text": "I was incredibly satisfied. I felt like a Las Vegas mob boss, smoking a cigar and getting head from a showgirl when I was done with my breakfast. Like a fucking champion!  The night before had been Stevey's b-day dinner and since I didn't have to work Saturday morning I got to indulge in brunch (well really breakfast since O.E. closes at 11:30) with some quality PHX peeps! Kristin and her partner in bad parking crime big J had a bad time with the parking (maybe the huge truck backing out of a space smaller than my vagina had something to do with it?) and right next to the Vig shone Over Easy. There were cute benches set up outside and the wooden cosy eating venue outside was super classy. It felt very west coast-and I agree it was nice not to see parking lots or highways while eating-all patios in the SW should seriously consider building more outdoor friendly structures like O.E. The wait for our group of 5 would be about a half hour-totally reasonable. I asked if we could have mugs of coffee while we waited and our server was totally sweet and brought it out for us and we hung out outside, enjoying the sunny day that was chilly enough for all of us to wear light jackets, sweatjackets, thermals and cable-knit sweaters but not have crippled cold hands for eating.   Our server ended up sitting us down early, warning us the kitchen was backed up-the food looked huge all around me so I figured it was worth the wait. The menu was a picky eater heaven. Most meals come with meat, and there is never a substitute for non-meat eaters like a fruit cup or scone, something of an upgrade from meat except more toast or potatoes. But I digress. It took me forever to figure out what I wanted, but I made my own meal from the sides menu with the country potatoes that Stevey seriously would NOT stop staring at. Now I know how chicks with big boobs feel. Stevey, look at ME, not my country potatoes you piggy!  I also got one egg over easy, no bread, and a chocolate syrup belgian waffle from the kids menu-with the short glass of OJ and coffee, my bill came out to under ten bucks! And I got a LOT of food that was cooked just perfect with really good hot sauce on the table and extremely helpful wait staff.  Kristin was right in taking note of the slats-when waiting, take note of where you will want to NOT sit-trying to eat while the bright arizona sun is burning your retina, causing you to flinch and tear up,  is not the most desirable  morning after look, you know?  The fact they let us linger and drink more coffee was def. a huge plus-I love the time a good weekend brunch takes with friends, its a great way to catch up what happened the night before or plan outings for the future or just shoot the shit, making each other laugh while having a good simple meal.  I peeked inside and noticed how bright and cheery the counter space was-I would totally come here early on a weekday just to read the paper at the bright happy and hip counter. The tables inside were small, but very cute diner-esque.  I just hope they plan on having misters come summertime so people don't melt like butter on waffles!",

You (Mr owner) OBVIOUSLY KNOW when the show is airing.. how about preparing ahead of time.. hire a freaking Host for \"whatever\" an hour and splurge on a food runner... another server would be nice but heaven forbid..that 3.50 an hour plus tips might break you....maybe the economy isn't so bad and everyone in the Phoenix area IS employed and you can't find help. One more cook equals 3 would be good.  4 lonely hands not so bueno. The way I look at it... in the time it took to order, get served, and then the 3 minutes to eat they could have turned the tables twice with proper staff.. feeding trice as many people, MAYBE making people happy (but ya need better food for that) hence making you some more money... but hey.. that's just me. Stick to cheap ways, doesn't matter here in Phoenix... everyone gets away with mediocrity... no competition.  I don't care if the owner is nice and has swanky white glasses.. get real dude... I'd rather you run the place than serve me my food.    Service wide.. i thought the guy clearing off tables and setting up was \"OFF THE CHAIN\"... Mr. Johnny on the spot!!  I'm not joking people.. this guy was the only guy with a sense of urgency.  Give him a raise.. if it wasn;t for him people would be waiting an extra 10 minutes on top thier already wrongfully delayed seating time.  The CF steak was  not bad but the gravy was less than average (clumpy and BLAND) therefore lessening the overall taste.   The pancakes tasted as if were made from a generic box mix with some extra ingredients chocolate chips added.  Nothing special..ANYONE can make the same at home.  The B&G.. well the biscuits were hard and oily.  The gravy.. again.. BLAND and clumpy.  I had the tater tots.. honestly.. i think they are Orida frozen tater tots.  Everything is served on small plated so it \"looks\" like a larger portion.  I'm not one for large portions anyways so no complaint there.    Overall.. the food looks appetizing from a distance.  Up close and personal - not so much.  Another tip... how about staying open past 11:30... 1:30 sound better.  I could have discovered how much i don't like this place many months ago.. but i always managed to arrive just as they've stopped seating.",

Oh so yummy!  I also shared a cranberry scone.  The place is small but if you go on  a Sunday before 9am your sure to get a seat in no more than 5 mins.  LIke Kristin says its cheap and oh yeah coffee was good too....anyway try it bc it is seriously tasty!  I had some of my bf's french toast topped with caramelized banana and pecans. TO DIE FOR!!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place since it opened, and I just finally got the chance last week.  And I was pretty unimpressed.  Maybe it was just that I had been building this place up for so long and had too high of expectations, or maybe it was the fact that we showed up for breakfast at 11 a.m. (30 minutes before they close) ... not sure, but I will not be returning any time soon.  It is not that I had a bad experience per se, but just that there are so many other great restaurants in the Valley that I will not be spending my eating-out money here!   I tend to get really excited about homemade lemonades, and when I saw the mint lemonade, it kind of reminded me of Matt's honey lemonade which is so frickin delicious, I decided to give this stuff a whirl.  Bleh ... waaaay too sweet! Tasted like they dumped way too much simple syrup in or something and the mint was very overwhelming.  Stuck with my water from then on. To eat, I ordered the cheddar jalepeno biscuits with sausage gravy.  My food arrived cold and the biscuits were hard, but the gravy was pretty tasty, and I liked the fact that each biscuit had a piece of sausage on it, so I had some sausage in every bite. Given that they were closing soon, I didn't bother asking them to heat up my food.  My friend ordered the Wolfpack, which was eggs, cheese, and bacon sandwiched between hash browns.  His meal actually looked way better than mine, and it was steaming, so I'm assuming it was served at a better temperature than my meal. He ate most of his food with no complaints, so I think he enjoyed it, but he didn't have too many positive things to say either.  Service was OK - actually pretty slow considering we were one of about three tables there.  Ambiance was like a diner but not as cute as Matt's and didn't really fit for the upscale breakfast prices.  The patio was really nice, but they only had two small fans to cool it off, so that was not an option in the 106 degree weather.   All in all, my friend and I both agreed as we walked off that while we thought our food was OK, we were in no hurry to return.",

The wait was only 10 minutes since I went at 9:30am. They close around noon or 1pm so go early. They had a shaded area and water for people who were waiting. The host was very nice and didn't need to call my name to be seated. The waitress was very attentive and the order prepared perfectly by the kitchen. My boyfriend ordered strawberry and cream waffles and I got the corned beef hash with a side a homemade hash browns. The food was amazing!!!! I highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. It's definitely worth the wait!!",

    "text": "This place is right near my house so I finally got up early and tried it out before school today. It's a cute place, not too big. Only four tables (w/ 4 chairs each) and about 10 seats at the counter on the inside. Several tables outside. I grabbed a spot at the counter and just went simple and had the two eggs and bacon breakfast. The bacon was really good, but only got two pieces. The scrambled eggs weren't great. Just some cheap egg mix with little taste. Toast was a big serving, but lukewarm and they carry a generic and tasteless jelly brand to go with it. The big disappointment was the hash browns. They're thick (almost doughy) and very bland. And I'll be damned if I eat bland hash browns with my breakfast! That's a little dramatic, but I do love my morning hashbrowns. For $7, I don't really feel the meal was worth it. Looking at the other prices on the menu, it seems most items are about $2-$3 more than you'd see at other breakfast joints. And I had some ice tea, which is a green tea that they serve. It was standard issue stuff. It tasted just like the green iced tea Einstein's bagels serve. I'll probably go back and try a bacon and cheese omelette at some point since I can't get my perfectly-made omelettes at the old Eggery on 44th st anymore. But until I make it back to try an omelette, I'll stick with The Good Egg/Eggery locations when I want breakfast due to their portions, prices, and (from what I can compare of the two) superior food. But like I said it's a cute place, near my house, and the staff is friendly and awake without being freakishly perky that early. But don't get too wrapped up in the Yelp hype...this is a 3-star place at best.",

The wait was about 35 minutes which we didn't mind we 15 minutes after we were seated for water and a server.  It was total confusion! Servers and bus people every where.  We had no silverware, we had to beg for coffee. I ordered the eggs florentine and my husband ordered eggs with corn beef hash.  While we were waiting for our food I noticed how  dirty the bus boys clothes were and one of them kept wiping his nose on his fore arm. Also there was a big guy in a black T Shirt that wiped his nose with the back of his hand. I was sick!  My husbands corn beef hash was very good but cold as was his dry toast. Mine was the worst florentine I have ever had, the hollandaise Sauce was so full of lemon that it made you pucker. I was not about to send it back. They asked if everything was ok and I told them that I could not eat it because of the lemon, they took it off our bill. I think Arizona is so desperate for non corporate, neighborhood restaurants that we sometimes over look the quality, I cannot over look dirty. CLEAN IT UP AND GET A REAL CHEF and try again. ,",

This works great for someone like myself who loves and breakfast and can never decide what to get.  Waffle, home fries and an egg? Sure.  Pancakes, tater tots and a ham steak? Done.  - There was a short wait when we got there but they served our party coffee while we waited. - The waitresses are really cute. - The outside seating is sort of a bummer with the sun depending on the hour and where you sit BUT I did enjoy that it was enclosed with wood slats so you aren't looking at the strip mall parking lot - The food itself wasn't amazing but it was good and filling.   - They let us linger at our table when we were finished even though there was a wait. - The menu isn't overwhelmingly huge....the food is simple, the selection is simple but its well done and enjoyable.   - The parking lot is small but you can park next door at The Vig.  I would definitely return, it was a good place for a group to have a nice casual breakfast.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and have always been satisfied, especially since I've discovered the eggs with wild mushrooms dish.  If you're a mushroom fan, it's definitely a must-try.  My mom came in town this weekend and I took her here Friday morning.  She had it, said it was the best breakfast she ever had, then asked if I wanted to go again Saturday morning, and she ordered the same exact thing. Also, their lemonades are really tasty mixed with iced tea.  They have mint in them.  It's yummy.  Their hash browns are good. You can also get tator tots, which taste like tator tots from anywhere else...but tator tots are always good.   It is small and does get crowded on weekends, but the wait is generally fast even if you have lots of parties in front of you, because they tend to turn over tables quickly.  There's actually a note at the bottom of their menu that essentially reads \"When you're done spending money, get the eff out.\"  Okay, it actually says something about being polite and cognizant of the people waiting for a table, but I don't think my interpretation was very far off. The meals are about $8-$10/each, which is a little pricey for breakfast, but the quality is good and the menu is more varied than you would find at a Denny's or IHOP, so I think it's worth it. Never had a problem with the service at all.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.  Especially the minty lemonade.",

But I agree that the syrup isn't the best I've ever had. *The Wolf Pack (eggs, bacon, and cheese served between two layers of hashbrowns) is the perfect greasy solution for coating that uneasy tummy. But be forewarned this one is served on a lake of melted butter, so it might actually be a better pre-drink meal. *The omelette's are a little on the bland side, but if that's what the Dr. ordered, then it's nice to have that option. *The coffee is actually above Par as compared to most restaurants. It's strong and smooth, with absolutely no hint of bitterness or that oily film that you find in some cups. And they serve actual cream, which rounds out the flavor and doesn't require you to use an entire container to mellow things out. *And what place doesn't deserve a second or third visit that offers 'tater-tots' as one of the potato selections?!!  I've never had to wait very long, even when there is a line to get in. Service is always friendly, but not always consistent, so you may need to take a dose of patients.  All in all this is a pretty decent place to have breakfast and doubly so when the weather is nice!",

Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in.   About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me.  My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready.  There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes. Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast",

    "text": "after disappointingly discovering that matt's big breakfast is closed on mondays (l-a-m-e), my girlfriend and i headed off to over easy to grab a hearty breakfast.  we got there at 10:40 on a monday morning, and waited 15 minutes for a table. a group of business men, whom the hostess told us were the boss's \"friends\" barged in 10 minutes after us (before we were seated) and got seated before us. the whole time we were dining, we saw no interaction between the businessmen and any sort of \"boss\" in the establishment. and the whole time they were loud and obnoxious. i'd rather have sat next to a crying baby.  onto the food! they were out of what my girlfriend wanted, the mexican egg dish, which the waitress should have notified us about before we spent 10 minutes deliberating on what we were going to order. so we went with the wolfpack dish and the eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and sourdough bread dish, as well as a side of corned hash, and 2 iced coffees.  the way they serve their iced coffee is unlike any i've ever had, and i wasn't THRILLED by it, but it wasn't the worst. a bit of mint and hint of caramel and really creamy. our entrees arrived on the smallest plates they had in the entire place, which made it a bitch to eat and i got food all over the table like a sloppy 3 year old. annoying. the corned beef hash was phenomenal, the best part of the whole meal. i can never find a place that cooks my scrambled eggs how i like them, and although these were a *little* on the overcooked side, at least they weren't undercooked and spongy like many places serve them. the bread was good, the hashbrowns good, and my girlfriend's wolf pack dish was ok as well. the bacon...yeah, it's smoked, and it tasted like it had been smoked with a coop of hens. very gamey, not my style whatsoever. and it wasn't extra crispy like i ordered it.  the place is very small and it gets quite loud in there. i would NOT recommend this place if you're hungover. i don't think i'll be back due to the crammed-ness of the place, the strange menu (which i could only find like 3 things i actually wanted to eat here, they have some weird options), and the a-ok service.",

My kids had chocolate waffles and m&m pancakes... both looked pretty gross to me.  (Too sweet).   It was a nice morning to enjoy an out door breakfast.   They were crowded but I guess that was because they were on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on a repeat last night.  They have a fairly small dining area in a building that was an older Taco Bell.

If you have experienced good chilaquiles--crisp tortillas with ranchera sauce and a sprinkling of farmer cheese, don't bother ordering these. I received a plate of limp, fat-soaked tortillas smothered in cheddar--a gloppy mess. The sauce was there, but so mixed in that it was unrecognizable. I didn't eat it. My partner fared better. He ordered the two egg breakfast which was basic and fine. I have no idea why this place was recommended to me by a friend. Maybe we just hit a bad day.",

    "text": "Breakfast is easy. As far as restaurants are concerned, it's something that's very hard to screw up. Menu creation can't be all that difficult because of the classic meat + egg + potato + bread formula we've all come to expect. I'm not here to write to say Over Easy screwed up, but they were on the verge of coming close.  I had been wanting to try Over Easy for about a  year now, partly because of all the media attention is has received locally as well as nationally. I'm always up for an alternative to the national chain pancake houses I grew up eating at. For this reason and the classic breakfast formula being so hackneyed and often trite, I am often inclined to avoid that part of the men, unless [the restaurateurs] try something a little different with it.  Over Easy showed promise with a little dish they call \"The Wolfpack\".   Upon more objective observation, the dish is just a mild variation on an old classic with more starch, luring you into a False sense of hedonistic pleasure, but really just filling your belly with potato.  Being my first time here, and looking to enjoy a good hearty breakfast, I decided to play it relatively safe and ordered The Hopple Popple. Chunks of salami, potato, cheese and egg scrambled together with bell peppers for color and for texture and served with a side of toast. It's another variation on an old classic and probably not unlike something I'd make at home, so I decided to try it.  It's description reminded me of something I had ordered at Matt's Big Breakfast not too long ago, so why not.  My first thought as my server placed my plate in front of me was \"That's it?\" Presentation left something to be desired and even though the atmosphere had a somewhat kitschy greasy spoon vibe to it, I wasn't all that impressed. The amount of salami was substantial, but the chunks were so big, they appeared sparse in the monochromatic assembly of ingredients that lay before me. It may sound silly, but a small bit of parsley or a sprig of rosemary as garnish would have probably classed up the plate a little.  My wife tried the Chicken Fried Steak, an old classic I am always drawn to, especially at independents because it really gives them a chance to shine. Any old restaurant can take a flash frozen fritter and drop it in the deep fryer, but it really takes something to bread your own steak. For that I give Over Easy kudos.   For my daughter, the economic egg + potato + bread dish (add meat for $2 more) satisfied all nutritional requisites but was very basic in it's execution. The most interesting part of the whole meal was when the matriarch of the crew behind the counter shared with us their Tomato Jam, a salty sweet concoction that was equally good as a spread on toast as it was a dip for tater tots.    In all, I wasn't all that impressed, but the menu showed promise and perhaps next time I'll be a little more adventurous in my selection as long is isn't just thrown on the plate because going out isn't all about the food, it's the experience as well.",

The eggs were relatively small, the english muffin they use was very thin but large in diameter, so the egg was like a quarter in the middle of this thin large muffin, and they used ham vs canadian bacon.  My husband had the lox (with bone in it!).  We both thought the hollandaise sauce was tasteless, watered down and must have been from a diluted mix because it totally lacked any discernible taste.  We would not return.",

We had to remind the waiter twice to bring drinks and once to bring toast that came with my father's meal. The food was equally unremarkable:  I had the cheddar biscuits and gravy and they were bland, barely seasoned and cold. My husband had the famed \"waffle dogs\" and he said they were \"decent,\" but that's about it. Our friend had the chicken fried steak and found it lacked seasoning, and the breading was sliding off of the meat. She said the hash browns were the best part of the plate, giving them \"three stars.\" Overall, we will never come back to Over Easy again due to the service and bland, average food.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to eating at this restaurant as it is close to my home and I have been excited about trying out a new breakfast joint.  Needless to say, I was filled with disappointment from the moment out waitress came over to take our drink order.  The woman was one of the most unfriendly waitresses I have ever met.  She approached our table and rudely asked for our drink orders.  Before I had even finished asking her for what I wanted she walked away and it took her almost 40 minutes to bring over the lemons for my water.  As she walked away, both my friend and I looked at each other with a look of shock on our faces.  Neither of us had ever experienced anything like this before in our lives.    The rude and unfriendly waitress returned to take our food order and although she wasn't as unfriendly as our first encounter, it seemed clear that being at Over Easy was just not the place she wanted to be.  After taking our order several other people ventured into the restaurant and took seats.    We sat for almost 40 minutes and finally noticed that several of the people at the tables that arrived after us had been served their meals.  I eventually got up and walked to the counter to inquire where our food was.  I was informed that it would be out in a couple of minutes and it was.  It was brought out looking like it had been sitting under a warmer for about 20 minutes.  The food was barely warm and all of the edges had started to dry up from the warmer.  Although we were assured that they had just come off the oven, it was clear that they had been sitting for awhile.    I was less than impressed by this restaurant and would recommend McDonald's for breakfast over this joint.  It's really too bad cause the menu looked great but the horrible service coupled with the bad food was a definitely thumbs down from me!",

If you've never had them before, I'd highly recommend trying them.  If you ask any of the staff, they'll tell you the same thing!  The staff was very attentive and we had a great time. I really enjoyed the open kitchen.  When you're sitting inside, you can see the kitchen right there.  As far as the place itself, it was small, not obnoxious, and felt very comfortable.  Probably would be best to avoid when it's raining, as the patio isn't completely covered.  Overall, Over Easy over achieves.",

One brother loved his Wolfpack and who wouldn't?  2 eggs, bacon & cheese sandwiched within two crispy layers of hash browns.  Yum!  The other brother thought the chicken fried steak was just okay.  The girls' mother liked her country benedict with a sausage patty, eggs and hollandaise sauce but didn't realize it was on a cheddar jalapeno biscuit.  That part wasn't her favorite.  As for me, I didn't care for the corned beef hash especially the texture.  Luckily I had also ordered a half order of the caramelized banana and pecan French toast.  Heavenly.  Plus I always love restaurants that allow half orders of French toast because then I can have a savory entree with a \"dessert\" without feeling like a pig for ordering two entrees.   And we all had to have the waffle dogs.  Its all the Food Network's fault.  And we are thankful to them for it.  It was delicious especially with the \"waffle dog\" sauce the servers set up - pancake syrup with hot sauce.",

    "text": "And once again, finding myself in the morning world, I am here.  What's with all the low blow reviews?  This place is pretty nice.  All three times I've been here, I've been graced by the same charming server and he's remembered me each time.  I don't know his name, and if I had a little less social anxiety, I'd probably ask.  Or not.  The mystery gives it a certain appeal.  Anyway, breakfast is breakfast no matter what you say about it.  That being said, this is probably one of my favorite places to go to for dishes with vegetables wrapped in egg.  It's one of the few places that has goat cheese as an option at a decent price, so 5 stars for going above the average for something like that.  Same for having a Lox dish (though it could use some capers).  It's a small thing, but it's the small things that count.  I also read/heard they're looking to get an alcohol license, probably to start serving mimosas.  If you're into that sort of thing, well, there you go.  I'm not even mad that he forgot my orange juice the last time I was here.  The place was busier than I've ever seen it, and servers are just as human as I am.  Maybe I'm too mellow to give bad reviews.  I also had a dentist appointment I had to get to shortly after, so... eh!  Whatever!    tl;dr: Go eat here, the food is excellent.",

Understandably so, it was very busy around 10 am on a Sunday, but our wait was only about 20 minutes.  In Arizona in March, we had no problem waiting outside in the sun :)  We got a round of Over Easy Iced Coffees to start, which are delicious!  Cinnamon, cardamom, sweetened condensed milk and mint - unique and tasty!  I'll have to figure out how to make these myself.  The Wolfpack (great name, by the way) is really the way to go.  Simple ingredients - hashbrowns \"stuffed\" with eggs any style, your cheese of choice and bacon... but simple does the trick for this savory breakfast lover!    There are lots of great brunch/breakfast options in the area so I'll probably explore some new spots during my next visit, but this is a great standby.",

My mushroom omelette was outstanding, with just the right quantity of flavorful brown mushrooms. So many mushroom omelettes are made with small bits of bland white mushroom that the whole thing seems sort of beside the point. I also had goat cheese in the thing and, damn, that tasted mighty fine.  Another bonus: Espresso tasted like it should, with complex flavor and zero bitterness. This is not easy to do, at least as judged by the dozens of places around the western U.S. I've tried the stuff, of which very few get it right.  Service and serving was prompt. The place is clean and comfortable and, for the high quality of the food and espresso, better prices than I expected. Will definitely be back!",

I forgot the name of the gal that was helping us but she made sure to constantly check in on us, refill our water, ask us how our food was, and even made the best recommendation!  FOOD: Chicken and waffles - the waffles are a bit on the softer side and not so much crisp. But the chicken really made up for it. I really enjoyed the breading and even though it was white meat, I still enjoyed it! Don't forget to ask for a side of hash browns!  Banana nut french toast - this dish was OK. I felt like the french toast did not have the best consistentcy - it was not thick and did not hold shape very well. It sort of tasted like it may have been sitting out for a bit. The nuts on it were cracked and sprinkled over, unlike what i saw on the show \"Diners, Drive-in's and Dives!  DRINK: Strawberry lemonade - it was just OK. A little watery and not enough lemonade in it - wish it was a little more tart!  SERVICE: This makes up for everything! Service here is the best - doesn't matter what time you come! Staff is friendly and attentive.",

It was a short 10 minute drive from the airport. We arrived just after 1:00pm (July 4th) and they were closing early (1:30pm) for the holiday. Guess that was a good thing cause the restaurant was almost empty except for two tables so there was no waiting at all. I ordered Banana nut French toast and George ordered Chicken fried steak, home fries and two eggs. My French toast had thick slices of toast and the perfect amount of toppings, it was very delicious. The chicken fried steak was delicious and I really loved their home fries. Service was outstanding, they were low on tea cause they were closing early but made a batch of tea just for George. So glad we came here, what a way to end our trip.",

We were fed some line about how they were on the list, left before their name was called and it's policy to seat people that do that ahead of those that were waiting at the restaurant.  The name she pointed to was a party of 4. Customer service is lacking. Every other restaurant i know of, and have worked for, has the policy that if you're not there when your name is called it is crossed off and you go to the end of the line. The food is good but we don't wait an hour to be treated like that.  We ended up leaving without being seated and going to Taylor's.",

The food was ok but not great in my opinion. My husband really enjoyed his chicken fried steak. It was a little pricey for what we got too, it cost us $43 plus tip for three people.

We we seated while the table was still being cleaned. The rag left the table wet and smelling of bleach. Oh yeah- and our nicely laminated menus were also stuck to the table as well. Nice start to Saturday morning breakfast.  While there was a nice crowd, it was not too loud. I looked over the menu and there wasn't anything that stood out to me except the Over Easy Iced Coffee with cinnamon, cardamon, mint and condensed milk. Sounds great. Too long of title to order. Tastes like watered down burnt Denny's coffee. So much for that.  We ordered: housemade corned beef hash + eggs, chicken fried steak + eggs and stack of their pancakes.  The hash tasted like dog food. The pancakes were dry and might as well be advertised as day-old bread. I was thoroughly disappointed.   Oh yeah and the one thing that kinda teed me off was that I asked the server about availability of their cinnamon rolls. She said she would check. It wasn't until I was walking out and saw a couple eating it did I realize that she never got back to me. Oh well.   Trendy and sounds cool but I had better at Denny's.",

It was \"ok\". Nothing to write home about.  My coffee cup sat empty for most of my meal. The orange juices we ordered for my daughters were pathetic; about an inch in the bottom of aforementioned cups.  Service left much to be desired, but it certainly wasn't the worst service I've experienced in my life.

Are people here really that accustomed to eating breakfast outdoors in a patio at 9am in 90+ degree heat? Interesting.  So I thought maybe the food was just so good that the heat didn't even phase you. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.    I ordered the Caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast (since that's what I saw on Triple D), and I thought it was just okay - no WOW-factor. My friend ordered the chicken fried steak (again, shown on DDD), and it definitely didn't taste as good as it looked. The gravy was good, but the steak itself was tough. My other friend had the best dish, The Over Easy - toasted brioche w/ spinach, egg, bacon (good bacon), and scallions. It was flavorful and fresh-tasting.  Though the food wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. I had intended on going to Matt's Big Breakfast but chose Over Easy at the last second. I later found out the wait at Matt's can be hours long. That has to say something.  The lesson here? Always trust your gut instinct!",

My boyfriend and I had the chicken fried steak and it was great. The slices of sausage in the gravy was really different but gave it a great taste.   Unlike some of the reviews, our service was right on and they were all really helpful. I do agree that they need a little more shelter from the summer sun, but we stood by the misters waiting for our table and it was totally worth the wait... I would definitely go back",

My friend was late and I had to sit for a while, but the gentleman taking names brought me a glass of water while I waited. So nice!  Food was decent and quick. I had the egg white omelet with asparagus, tater tots, and a side of bacon. All were delish, though the omelet's asparagus was too greasy, probably cooked on the griddle. My friend had the French toast, which wasn't anything to write home about but fine.   My coffee was way too strong (and I typically love strong coffee) but I was happy they had milk to put in it instead of cream. I had to ask for refills, though. But water glasses were filled promptly.   We sat outside and were pretty cool under the misters but eventually got uncomfortable. Overall, Over Easy is a nice place to go if you don't feel like going to a Denny's-ish kind of place. The tater tots are awesome and the prices are good. It's not the best brunch EVAR but it's certainly one I'd have again.",

    "text": "Perhaps I've ordered the wrong things or just have shown up on off-days during my 4-5 visits to OE, but I've left wholly unimpressed on every occasion:   The cheddar jalapeno biscuits and gravy weren't worth finishing; punctuated by the taste of raw flour in the dry, particle board-like consistency of the biscuits and the thin and relatively bland gravy topping them. This was a let down, since biscuits & gravy are one of my favorite dishes of all.   The country benedict was another dish I'd ordered during a subsequent visit and also was let down by. This comes with a cheddar jalapeno biscuit as well, so I purposely ordered it to see if the same taste described above was present. It was. Dry, raw flour particle board-like biscuit again. To add to the frustration, this country benedict was topped with two nearly solid-yolked poached eggs. I think anyone ordering eggs benedict expects yolks to spill out & drizzle & meld with the hollandaise sauce upon cutting into them. These just sat there like soft boiled eggs cut in half. Covering the eggs was a hollandaise sauce that tasted highly acidic- more like a mustard or lemon bite to it than the smooth, rich and decadent hollandaise I was accustomed to. Perhaps the hollandaise was 'right' according to OE standards, but I didn't enjoy it in any way. Rounding this out was sausage patties, which tasted fine and tater tots as my potato side. I can deal with one miscue in an eggs benedict dish, but three full-on miscues? Eggs done wrong, highly acidic hollandaise, dry/raw flour tasting bread? Nope. The pork and potato side should not be the highlight of a benedict. Ever. I ate slightly more than half before I pushed my plate away and decided to speak to the manager about my meal and to express my disappointment. He kindly removed the entree from my bill, and I paid for my OE iced coffee and left about a 30% tip. That OE Ice coffee is the one redeeming factor; I do love that drink.   Add consistently grungy, dirty table tops and slow(but competent) service to the disappointing dishes I've had on every visit, and I simply have zero interest in returning. I gave 'em 4 or 5 college tries to get it right, but it's obvious that OE simply isn't the place for me.",

    "text": "This was a terrible experience.  It literally took over 30 minutes from placing our orders to actually receiving our orders.  We have been there before and had a good experience so the delay without anyone updating us was frustrating. When the food finally came,  only four of the five orders came out. My simple order of scrambled eggs and hash browns was still being cooked.  The chicken omelet was made with ham so that got sent back, the chicken with waffles was fair, the steak and eggs were inexplicably made with egg whites and was a pool of some clear sauce.  The omelet came out again this time no ham but also no chicken.  When we asked about the delay we were told that the cooks had all been fired earlier in the week and they were training a new staff.  Never offered to adjust the bill and never heard from a manager. We had to get folks to the airport otherwise we would have raised the issue. We may or may not go back but not for a while, there are too many good breakfast places to suffer through this.",

Since I already had breakfast at the hotel, I wanted something small to nibble on while the other girls ate. But then the PB&J french toast on the menu caught my eye. Mental image of thick toast with swirls of peanut butter and syrup-like jam with powdered sugar. I couldn't resist ordering!  The server later informed me that they only have half an order of the french toast and asked whether I wanted a half order of something else. Since I wasn't hungry, I told her that the half order is fine. But at the same time I was wondering how on earth do they only have half an order. Did they run out of bread??  One by one my friends' orders arrived. Big plates of hearty looking food. Then mine arrived, on a dinky plate. Sitting there in loneliness and despair.   PB&J French Toast (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=FTpZP-NSq5VuEXC_S73C6w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_o...</a>): Are you friggin kidding me?!

Was not tasty and didn't finish it. I made sure that I did not have to pay full price for this. Luckily, they took the whole item off the bill.  Smoked Salmon & Mushroom Omelet (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=7IF34zeAOIegxtukbZle-A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_o...</a>): Huge! The tatertots were good.

When I picked up the order I was charged $3.00 for a side of Sweet Potato tots when I had asked if these were an option as a potato side. When I opened the bag my Mediterranean eggs were on the bottom of the bag. When I told the wait staff she asked for the order to be re-made. While my Mediterranean eggs were being re-made my Avocado Benedict stayed in their Togo box that I could see was sitting on the line. When the manager came over to apologize she was condescending when I told her how frustrated I was. I had to ask for her to offer a discount or take the order off my card. Not good Management skills!! When I received my new Togo bag 15 minutes later I specially asked the Manager if the Avocado eggs that were sitting on the line was in the bag. The manager said no everything has been re-made. When I got home the Avocado eggs were cold. I will never visit this establishment again!!",

Menu prices were very reasonable and breakfast for two costed only $21.24. The waffle dogs are cute and yummy. You must dip them in the sauce to truly enjoy them. Light breakfast and not overly filling. The wolf pack my friend got looked like a big heap of morning goodness. I had a bite and if was what I expected. Very good and she was very full afterwards. I would suggest trying the chicken and waffles. They looked great but I didn't try them. Overall cute little place to try out. Go there if you have the chance.",

We were seated within minutes of arriving, even though it was busy. The hostess was pleasant and courteous about providing enough space to fit out 9 month old at the table comfortably. Our server, Jenna, was absolutely fantastic. Recommended some incredible meal choices. My fiance was consider both the chicken fried steak and the lemon ricotta pancakes, but decided on just the CFS and I got the breakfast nachos plate( I don't remember how to spell the actual name of the dish... started with a C). Once we ordered our food, we waited for 15 or 20 minutes, at the most. The server interacted with us, making us laugh and smile  (a huge plus). When she brought out the food, she surprised us with a free lemon ricotta pancake, insisting that she couldnt let us leave without trying it, of course she paid for it. Hands dpwn, the best we have ever had, Jenna was definitely right and so awesome! Strawberry -rosemerry lemonade was incredibly refreshing! And the Nitro coffee was unique and delicious as well! All-in-all, if we. One back to AS, we will definitely stop in again! Thanks Jenna for your amazing-ness.",

At Over Easy, this usually means french toast, eggs benedict, or pancakes all of which are delicious.   Today, I ordered a simple two-egg breakfast; scrambled with an english muffin, two strips of bacon, and side of pico de gallo. Perhaps I was hungry from the bike ride over, though it was my favorite meal there yet.   The lightly toasted english muffin was served with butter and a well-balanced strawberry jam, the pico de gallo was crisp and refreshing, and the eggs the right fluffy texture.   As a single diner, I prefer not to sit at the bar with my back to the entryway. Sitting at a four-top table seems wasteful, especially when families arrive needing more space. Next time I'll let the wait staff know I'm willing to share.  The wait staff is friendly, prompt, and helpful, offering to warm up coffee often and accommodate diners. The owners are cognizant of the music volume, which I appreciate. I preferred the more quaint stand-alone location off 40th St to the strip mall.",

    "text": "If you ever watch Foodnetwork's Diner's Drive In's and Dive's, you'll know that host Guy Fieri has been in the valley a few times showcasing local restaurants. His appearances and shows have taken successful eateries from popular to super stardom in one simple episode.  Go to Over Easy anytime during peak weekend breakfast rush hours, and you'll more than likely have a hard time finding parking as well as a table. Early bird does get the worm, I had front row parking and sat immediately around 8am though on the way out there were probably about 10 people milling around waiting for a table.  Chef owner Aaron May has built a reputation on well executed high quality eats and continues to do so, including a new second Over Easy location in the west valley. Aside from the free publicity on the triple D, Over Easy is legit with many delicious, comforting and sometimes outrageous breakfast plates.  Housed in what used to be a Taco Bell, the place has been spruced up with bright yellow paint, an open kitchen and a spacious patio. Service is good and if you happen to sit on the inside, its kind of funny listening to one of the surly chefs smart off to the line cooks, not being a much of a morning person, I welcomed this.  The morning beverage line-up is what you'd expect, though it's whats unexpected which draws my excitement. The deliciously tart Strawberry Lemonade with rosemary ($3) was a welcome surprise. If anything is going to wake you up, its going to be the drinks bright flavors with a wonderful rosemary finish. The Coffee ($2.25) for me was on the weak side, perhaps that's in part to my 2 shot a day espresso habit?  Being dinner centric I decided to make one of the \"griddles\" a breakfast appetizer. Each tender syrupy fork full of the Caramelized Banana and Pecan Brioche French Toast ($7) was like biting into sweetened maple flavored clouds. The perfectly toasted crunchy pecans were a nice counterpoint to the warm chewy bananas.  Over Easy isn't all great, the breakfast sammie, Loretta ($7) came out room temperature both times I had ordered it with the Swiss cheese being barely melted. Making up for this short coming, The Wolfpack ($8) is quite the breakfast love mound. 2 eggs anyway you like them, bacon and cheese all sandwiched between layers of crisp buttery hashbrowns. The eggs were ordered over easy as to enjoy the hot gooey yolks amongst the smokey bacon, deliciously filling.  For those of you who like a contest, try ordering Big E's Pile-up ($30). Ready for this? A dozen eggs, 12 slices of cheese, 3/4 of a pound of bacon, and hashbrowns all covered in country gravy. Sound like a challenge? If you can finish it in 30 minutes or less, it's on the house! This seems like a challenge waiting for a True professional. Who knows, maybe they are priming the way for another television appearance, Man vs. Food anybody?",

Our other friend had the pumpkin brulee french toast (brioche, I believe ) and it came with a caramel bourbon sauce which she loved! She also had the over eady iced coffee and raved about that as well. I had the chicken and waffles. It was a nice crispy breast (boneless) and a decent sized waffle. Not anything fancy but delicious.

The table was a little sticky and the laminated menus were wet.  Our server greeted us immediately and took our drink orders.  The menu is simple and short, love it.  But I am with indecisive people.  The server had to come back twice before everyone decided on what to order.    I ordered the The Crying Pig omelet (Bacon, Sausage & Swiss cheese) and hash browns.  The omelet was a little over done on the edges but perfect in the middle.  The hash browns were good and greasy!  I ordered a 1/2 order of the french toast to share with other person.  The 1/2 piece I got tasted kind of burnt but the part that was not tasted great.    I am with Michael F. on this place 3 for the food and 4 for the service.  Overall 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "After reading some of the reviews on Yelp we decided to try Over Easy this morning. It had a wonderful casual and friendly vibe and we decided to sit at the counter instead of waiting 30 minutes for the busy waiting list. The server at the counter (and I'm pretty sure he was one of the managers) was extremely friendly and offered suggestions on what to try since it was our first time. Their menu is really nice and has healthier options like egg whites for most of their items. They even threw in a complimentary cheddar jalapeno biscuits for us to try since it was our first time there. It was so great we can't wait to be back with our kids because I know that they would love the waffle dogs and the delicious French toast. they even have tater tots and sweet potato tater tots! The clientele is also super nice we ended up meeting a really nice couple seated next to us &exchanged phone numbers. it was just an overall wonderful experience",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I arrived on a Sunday morning, and not surprised that it was busy. Got two seats at the bar. Ordered a raspberry mimosa and a regular bloody mary. Both were very pleasant. John took our order and was very nice.  I asked for the florentine benedict and my friend ordered the corned beef hash.  When they arrived, my eggs were overcooked and had been sitting so the entire plate was lukewarm.  I stated my complaint to John, who immediately took care of the problem, however it took 10 minutes to replace the dish, leaving my friend to eat his alone. I had also ordered a spicy bloody mary, and had not been told that it was tomatillo based as compared to a typical red tomato based drink.  I did not see anything on the menu stating the difference, and found it unpleasant to drink, as it seemed thick, and the whole thing tasted more like drinking salsa instead of a bloody mary. I did not get through half of it. Overall: it was ok. If I had a choice of going back there, as compared to some of the other places I have eaten, I would go to the others. Customer service was excellent and saved what was not really a good experience into a decent but not anything special one.",

The skinny  My girlfriend found a great deal in living social for 10$ you would get 40$ credit but only in 10$ increments great deal for a great place. We decided to go on a Tuesday hoping it would not be too busy it was not they had plenty of seats and people kept coming in. I ordered the chicken fries steak with 2 eggs and hash browns the dish looked picture perfect with plenty of food not bad for 10$ the eggs were perfect and the hash browns are to die for the seasoning they use is amazing, the chicken fried steak was a bit salty to me but some hot sauce helped it out :-) my gf ordered a veggie breakfast sandwich and hash browns and she was very pleased. We sat at bar an asked for separate checks and we used 2 of the coupons we had both out meals came out to under 10$ with tip which was great the waitress didn't seem to thrilled for our savings, lol.  Overall this place is great and affordable the food is good and the parking is easy. I had to dodge a few kids while walking to car so please slow down while here :-).",

And the Wolf Pack was absolute perfection. Syrup and Cholula?! Who knew!   I introduced many friends to this place and everyone fell in love. Unfortunately the last two times I've been within the past 2 months has been terrible! Each time something was subpar.   Portions are smaller, eggs are way overcooked, bacon is dry, burnt and old looking, ingredients are skimpy and do not taste fresh.  To top it off, service is MEH and I don't think our server said more than 5 words to us the entire meal.   Today I finally had to confess to my boyfriend that it is off our radar. But I'll still dream about the Waffle Dogs in my sleep!",

We also added an order of the cheddar jalapeno biscuits with gravy but we shared everything.  The chicken fried steak was a nice size, very tender and the gravy was tasty. The banana walnut french toast added the perfect balance too offset the savoriness of the other dishes. No added syrup was needed, even the burnt crust of the french toast was yummy. The biscuits were nice, thick & fluffy and it was smothered in their gravy which I believe is the same used for the chicken fried steak.  We decided to check this spot out because we're fans of DDD and try to visit as many locations featured on the show as possible. Overall, I wasn't disappointed by the quality or taste of the dishes but my boyfriend and I were definitely still hungry afterwards. Possible that we just eat too much, but wouldn't it try again.",

The restaurant is nice and clean. It's bright white walls and yellow accents get you in the mood for breakfast (not that you weren't already). If you are flying solo or a couple you have a bar to sit at or booths and tables.  Service is great. The waitstaff is friendly and not too clingy.  Oh and the food- that's the best part- be sure to arrive hungry. The portions are big, but I like that.   Cons: Because of how the restaurant is laid out it's a bit loud. When I was there it was 1/2 full and I thought a bit louder than I would care for. But it's not enough for me to say no to going.   I got the wolf pack on this visit. My advice would be to ask for extra cheese.",

I had a pink grapefruit juice to wash it all down and it was so tasty and just a bit sweet that I'm planting a grapefruit tree in my yard so I can have juice like that all the time. You know what I mean?!  There were things on the menu that snagged my attention as well, the lemon ricotta pancakes.....say what?? Hell yeah Im trying those fo sho! Huevos Rancheros.....you know it!  If you're in need of some good breakfast and a cool chill ambience, check this little spot out! Worth it!  Excellence service too!",

We met with some work colleagues who were in town briefly and decided to meet here for a breakfast meeting. While the food is always great here, and the service quick and very friendly, the cleanliness of the floors were definately not up to scratch. There was lots of old food and dropped eating utensils underneath our table that had obviously not been removed or cleaned after each party of guests who had sat at the table prior. This was rather off-putting to us and our colleagues. While I will be back again for their famous \"Wolf Pack\" and other menu choices, I would like to see a little more attention to keeping the place clean and fresh, just like their menu!",

The best thing about it was the staff- they were really cool and accommodating, especially given the annoying pseudo-yuppie Scottsdale crowd slumming it (yes there IS a wait, even for you!).  The food was edible, but honestly I can think of a dozen better places for breakfast. Its inexpensive, so it wasn't that upsetting that my chicken fried steak was of the frozen variety,and the gravy had this very strange gratuitous smoky porky flavor. Yes they do have good coffee, and fresh juice. All in all it was.....o.k.   The most perplexing thing though- they serve everything in these tiny side dishes, which is not to say the portions are small, but the dishes are. You can't even see the plate for the food. I just wound up eating my steak off the counter-- thank god it was clean.  45 minute wait? Perhaps not.",

We had a family member in town and we met up for breakfast one Sunday morning with a medium sized group.  We weren't the first to arrive, and the first people arriving already had staked out a table for us, so no wait for us.    The first thing that I noticed was that the menu seemed a lot heartier than my first two visits (including something on the menu that appeared as if it was trying to be a challenge for Man V. Food).  While it doesn't bother me particularly that they expanded the menu, I didn't really see why they needed to change from the simple menu they had.  And no JPO coffee???  (Ok, so the coffee was probably still the same, but I still liked the whole 'JPO' part).    Anyways, I had the basic brioche french toast with a side of tater tots (big plus for having tots).  It was good, not spectacular.  The tots were ample, so I appreciated that.  Service was good.  It did seem to get a bit warm, but we were in the 'outdoor' section, so that was to be expected.    Probably closer to 3.5 stars, but this was my 3rd time there, and I would go back, so I'm rounding up to 4 stars...I think it was the tots that put them over the top.",

Of course, we both thought that they would include a bagel or bread of some kind...NO.  They gave her two pieces of lox, a glop of cream cheese and three pieces of cold asparagus.

We go out to breakfast pretty much EVERY weekend since we have a toddler, don't have access to a babysitter and don't get to go out to night-time, kid-unfriendly places. So again... I don't get it! We've tried to like this place. Went back a couple times thinking maybe it was a fluke, that we were just there on an off-day or something. And each time we go back, we're mad that we wasted our time waiting in their long line and that we spent our money on this sub-par food. I think if you're a breakfast place, you should at least do homemade potatoes... I'm pretty sure they use Ore-Ida's. One good thing I can say is that whoever wrote their menu did a good job of making things sound good and building them up, unfortunately though the food just doesn't cut it. I'd say skip it to anybody thinking of coming here! (BTW... BLEW MY MIND that Food Network Mag. called this the best breakfast in AZ!!! OK... who's paying off who at Food Network Mag?!?!)",

I believe the blueberries were canned or frozen but definitely not the size or taste of a fresh berry. And the blueberry glob was spooned into the middle of the pancake upon cooking so the only time a blueberry is consumed is when you get to the center, which is a huge disappointment. Finally I feel the pancakes are overcooked or the mix balance needs adjustment, a great blueberry pancake is soft, fluffy, digestible and takes u back to grandma's kitchen. These were leathery, heavy in the stomach and unsatsifying. For the love of blueberry pancakes please show the pancake gods that better can be done.",

The tiny bits of banana  were not sufficient for the portion of toast. The sauce, eh...nothing special.   Hash was under seasoned and my BF reported the CF steak could use some help as well.

The buiscuits have jalepenos, which are so good. The fried egg sandwich with sausage is amazing as well. I really dont know how they do it, but it is truly amazing.",

    "text": "When here today after Pat's Run for a hearty breakfast. There was about a 10 min wait so we decided to sit at the bar. Usually when you sit at the bar at a restaurant you get waited on pretty quickly. Not here! We waited about 10 minutes before somebody asked us if we wanted coffee or anything?? By that time we were already ready to order and we did and the food was really, really good! So the wait was worth it as far as the taste of the food goes - I will give you that. My son had the chicken and waffles and they were delicious. Then, we finished our meal and waited another 15 minutes or so while our waiter at the bar walked past us a few times to deal with other customers. Finally, I flagged down another waitress and asked her if we could just pay our bill so we can get going and she said she would take care of it. She gave us our bill we paid and she apologized and we took off. I guess the moral of the story is - great food, not so great service. If you've got a lot of time, go there! If not, maybe opt for some place with quicker service.",

I ended up ordering the wolfpack and I am embarrassed to say I ate the whole thing. It was huge and I was full the whole day. I couldn't even eat dinner! They put lots of yummy cheese on my eggs and the hash browns were crispy just the way I like them. My sister ordered the OE omelet and she said it was really good too. I was a fan of the food but I wasn't a fan of the wait. Also the seating arrangement here is too close for comfort they put a whole bunch of couples tables together and seat you next to strangers. Not my cup of tea.",

After waiting for a table for about half an hour, we were seated in a very well decorated restaurant. While I wasn't too crazy about the food, I will say the service was great. Our server (known as Funnyman on the receipt) was the perfect blend of fun and responsible. I honestly wish there were more servers like him at local restaurants. The food is decent, but the service is something to remember.",

The sauce to those french toast, however, should be on the table! The service was great, though I never judge a restaurant for service. Food establishments serve one purpose, to serve food! Anyway, everyone should try the crazy chicken dish, it's tasty, no wonder it is so popular. oh, and the lemonade, is also delicious!

    "text": "I'm going to have to join the ranks of \"meh\" on this one. I have previously steered clear of Over Easy because of all the negative reviews here, but today being Memorial Day Weekend, it was the only place that was open (we later saw that The Big Orange was open, but sorely lacking in parking spots), so we gave it a try.   We were told 10-15 minutes from the host, and I was skeptical when I saw the packed dining area, but truly we only waited about 7. So a big thumbs up for hustling us in. The patio area, which appears to hold the majority of the tables, was the best part of the experience. Shady, cool, and comfortable, and effectively shielded from the ugliness of Indian School.   Then we proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait for our food. Took forever! The waitress did mention that they were down one cook. Fortunately we weren't in a hurry and hubby and I got to spend some quality together. No biggie. Our waitress forgot my mint-lemonade for about 15 minutes, and when I got it, it was simultaneously too sweet and too watery. The coffee was fair, no complaints. The water was typical Phoenix...obviously not filtered.  The food: I got the corned beef hash with two eggs sunny-side up and toast. Whoa baby, those eggs had barely touched the pan before they were spooned on to my plate! There was still a gelatinous coating of RAW floating on top of my liquid yolks, and I considered sending it back, but by then I was starving, Salmonella be damned. My corned beef hash was tasty but had several chunks of chewy gristle mixed in. Mmmmm...connective tissue....  So this place gets points for ambience, but loses stars for food quality and price. I am willing to give it another try on a non-holiday weekend, because it's close to our house and we need a good brunch place.",

The interior is bright, sunny and welcoming. You can see the kitchen make you your delicious breakfast....or what should have been a delicious breakfast... We had a blueberry muffin with lemon curd to start. I love that flavor combo, but our muffin tasted packaged and the lemon curd was poorly made.  For my main course, I had some combination of eggs and bacon and hashbrowns (No, toast is NOT included!). I always order my eggs over medium because runny whites make me gag and my bacon well done, because who likes soggy cured pork fat?! I was thoroughly disappointed that not only were my eggs oozing clear jiggly white liquid, but my bacon was soft and slighlty soggy. Oh and I do not know if they prepare the hashbrowns there themselves, but if they do, the cooks should make them appear a little bit less than the frozen bagged stuff you get at Fry's.  On the plus side, the service was great, and the manager even nicer than the servers.",

    "text": "Been there about a couple of times now, have been very disappointed and urge people to look for a decent breakfast elsewhere.  The first time we went, my wife and I put our names down and were told it would be 20-30 mins wait. A family arrived shortly after us and were told the same thing. After around 15 minutes and elderly couple arrived and were told that there was a wait. The elderly lady complained outside saying that they were regulars and shouldn't have to wait. Two minutes later, the hostess came out the door, walked past ourselves and the other family, and escorted the elderly couple in. Of course we all complained and the hostess commented she didn't realize that we had all been out there longer. The manager defended her saying that \"this can sometimes happen\". So we left.   Just last weekend, we thought we would try again. Actually got in straight away and had our two year old with us, so our hopes were up. Then we got served, literally. The coffee tasted like water with a couple of soaked coffee beans. The waitress was a no show after taking our order. Never asked how things were or if we were after anything else. Our water and coffee flavored water was never refilled even though we did ask for it, twice. Our food, which took about 30 minutes to arrive, was originally delivered to the wrong table, and when we did get it, was flavorless, bland and cool. The manger then came by asking if everything is \"wonderful\". By that I'm sure he meant was the tv station on the right channel, because it certainly wasn't the food or service.  When we left, we finally saw our waitress, and over heard her complaining to the manager that we had been there too long, had backed up traffic outside and her tips were going to suck. Here's a tip for you young lady, actually be a waitress, check on us every now and then and find out why our flavorless crud of a breakfast is taking so long so that we can get out sooner.  We will never be going back, \"wonderful\" isn't a word associated with Over Easy and I whole heartily suggest that you all look for somewhere else.",

    "text": "Over easy? More like over rated.  I had such high hopes for this place.  Meh.  After almost an hour drive across town to try this DDD breakfast joint we arrived excited.  Following a 15 min wait (not bad) we sat at our table and surveyed the menu.  I decided on the banana pecan pancakes and a side of corned beef hash.  The pancakes were wonderful. This is why I gave 2 stars.  I got the half order which consisted of 2 medium pancakes covered in a sweet caramel like sauce, 2 pieces of banana, and a sprinkle of pecans. I added some of the maple syrup that was on the table for an even sweeter treat.  My hash on the other hand was no different than a cheap diner, out of the can, mushy hash.  It was a disappointment. Major.  The service was friendly and reasonably attentive. My coffee stayed nearly full the entire visit which I appreciate.  I ordered the blueberry muffin with lemon curd to go. In my container were 3 small mini muffins with minimal berries, the opposite of moist, and a side of lemon curd that was actually wonderfully delicious.  The atmosphere was mediocre in a small square room filled with tables and chairs reminiscent of my childhood in the later 70s/early 80s. It put a smile on my face as I recognized the boomerang pattern and plastic chairs. I noticed how cramped this place was as I weaved my way to the restroom to wash my hands. Overall it was just ok for me.  I don't think I will be taking the drive back again.",

    "text": "Over Easy is just not very good.   I was excited to add a new breakfast spot to my rotation, sadly this will not be one of them.   Let me start by saying, I gave this place 2 chances. I always go back if I had bad service/food the first time, in case it was a fluke.   1st visit, we wait for 30 or so minutes (there were only 2 of us). We get seated at the counter, where we were promptly ignored. They were jamming busy, We finally flagged down someone after a good 10 minutes of watching people go past us. We order drinks and our food.   I see a 4 top get seated well after us. Well after we ordered our food. Not only do they get their food wayyy before us, BUT THEY FINISHED EATING before our food ever came to us!!! Not cool, at all.   2nd time we go back, we get seated on the covered outside patio. I was worried it would be to hot, but they have fans and it does a good job of keeping it cooled down in the hot summers. This time, same freaken situation. People being served way after we had ordered/been seated.   The hubs and I are always easy people to wait on. We are very easy going and understand how things go in restaurants as we have both worked in them before. I don't know who does the hiring or running of things over there, but WOW.   Wont be going back here again.   p.s. I guess i never spoke about the food. The 1st visit I ordered a waffle. since we sat at the bar, we could watch things being made. After the 3rd attempt of making my waffle, it was placed on a plate and sat under the warmer for a good 20 minutes or so. Which Had I known that was my waffle, I would have just walked back in the kitchen and grabbed it myself. The Husband ordered an omelet which should have been easy to make and have come up at the same time or near when my waffle did. No such luck.   The second time I ordered their signature Over Easy dish...I thought I was going to black out, it was soooo soggy and so just flat out disgusting that I went home hungry :(",

They did a great job with the renovation, and now this former Taco Bell is very hip.  I find the prices reasonable, and the food is great!  The menu is basically a la carte (I think most everything is under $10), so you can pick and choose depending on how hungry you are.  The egg white omelette has great ingredients and is filling.  The home fried potatoes are crispy.  Loved the waffle, but didn't think the chocoate cinnamon syrup (a $1 extra) was worth it, regular maple syrup would've been just fine.  I want to go back to try the razz-cherry scone!  I've had friendly service the past few times that I've been there, and it's definitely a family-friendly place.  The reason for 4 stars:  the majority of the seats are outside, and I don't think that I'll be going there now that its 90 degrees outside.",

In addition to that the family had done their Food Network research looking for recommendations Over Easy being one of them.   Now I have to admit two things: 1. I am not a huge breakfast person....well not really a breakfast person at all.  2. Despite that I had been eager to try Over Easy due to the FN hype and its crowd every weekend.   Now to the food. I ordered the corn beef hash...I love my hash...with toast and coffee. It was a good portion with flavor and I was pretty happy with it. The rest of the group got the banana French toast and waffle. Both were pleased but not blown away.   In the end Over Easy gets 3 stars due to something that's probably not their fault, over hype. The food was decent but nothing crazy. The atmosphere is what killed it in my book. There was no AC. We sat outside in 110 degree heat...not pleasant. The service was slow and just overall not impressed.   Even though I am not a breakfast guy if I am in that part of the town again looking for something to eat I am heading to LGO...",

    "text": "I heard about this place on yelp and found out that it was on the best thing I ever ate or the diner show. Any how it is far from me, but I had some time and I am always willing to have good food, so I decided to pay a visit. It took about 40 minutes but I was willing to give it a try. First it was like 6:45 am so only I and a couple of other early riser. I had what everyone was raving about, the waffle dog and the famous caramelized banana french toast and a side of sweet potato tater tots and of course coffee. First all of that was like over 20.00 with tip, so it is pretty steep for breakfast. First off, the waffle dog was not that great or even good really. I think it is a good ideal but unfortunately the battered is just too light so after the first bite and dipping, it kind of fell away from the sausage. It needs a heavier binder like cornmeal aka corn dogs to really stick to the sausage. The other problem I noticed that the sauce combination of hot sauce and maple syrup kind of canceled each other out. At first I was surprise that the sauce was bland, then I remembered that when you want to counter something spicy, you use something sweet. So no matter how I mixed the sauces together, I just could not get that sweet, spicy, salty combination to be right. If they want it to be more consistent, they need to formulate the sauce and premix it. The sausage was lost in everything so you only get a little salty taste at the end. I understand they are going for that salt,sweet, & spicy combination similar to say sweet and sour chicken but unfortunately they don't achieve it. I really can't see why people love them, they are just okay and pretty awful when you considered they are 8.00, would not order them again myself.  The second thing  I had was the french toast. First they did not caramelized it long enough because it was just runny and it made the french toast all soggy. They also used just regular sliced bread, not even Texas toast, something thicker to give it some crispiness to it. A perfect french toast is light and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, this was not nearly anything like that. They need to add some starch to make the sauce a real sauce and not just water. It had to be one of the worse french toast I have ever had.   The last thing was the sweet potato tater tots, now they don't look like they made these from scratch or if they did I would not know. All I know was that it was not crispy in the least. Tater tots should be crispy and firm. Had a funny taste to it that I could not identify.  Well that was my one and probably last visit to here. It is just too far to go for below average food.",

    "text": "Hey, guys? Here's another thing that Food Network broadcasts: COOKING SHOWS! This way you can stay home and make something for yourself and then we won't have to read how disappointed you were by your \"small\" portion of french toast that looked bigger on DDD's (just like McDonald's burgers REALLY look juicy in the picture menu!), or that you were hot (you live in Phoenix!! Is this a news flash? Wear a tank-top!), or that the wait was long and you had to stand in your Ugz for 15 minutes (quick! call WHINE-1-1).   I partook of the \"Over Easy\" twice, and clearly had diff'rent experiences from others:  First time, there was no wait. Sat inside with my main squeeze, had a friendly waitress, and enjoyed: I had a truly delicious omelette with salmon, asparagus and goat cheese, hash browns and toast. the omelette was fluffy and nicely done, and the hash browns had that \"glorious brown/gold crust of crunchy heaven\" layer on top.  What'd he have?......Oh, yeah! The egg breakfast - and the eggs were done just right. Both our toasts were in-the-middle. they could do better on their jams: standard issue, and full of corn syrup. Yuck.  Second time: main squeeze + two friends. Sat on the patio (and bypassed a 15 minute wait for indoors). Yes - it was warm, but we knew it would be. There was still a fan and it was still before noon. We survived. Had yet another omelette - even BETTER the second go-around. My bud had fluffy, golden brown, delicious looking blueberry pancakes - with the blueberries underneath ( I snuck a bite), the squeeze had eggs and tots (which were crispy and not too greasy), and the other bud had a sausage omelette (which he sung the praises of).  It was charmingly ludicrous how many times we got offered water refills (they REALLY wanted the patio patrons to be hydrated and happy - it was nice to see). I also had a lemonade with mint (house-made and oooooh so nice).  What made it nice was our sassy waitress Sarah (who still hasn't hiked Squaw Peak and playfully razzed us for having come from doing just that). She was attentive, funny, easy-going,  and knew the menu. The patio, in fact, was quite a-buzz with attentive staff (with water pitchers).  I will be returning.  So, um.....yeah - it' a small place. You can see that going in. If there's not enough elbow room for you to show off your new handbag or your 12th piercing, this place might not be for you. And yeah - the patio is OUTSIDE (gasp!!). Have a glass of water before-hand and quit yer' bitchin'! Hydrate!  Oh, and P.s? Matt's Big \"B\" only got big because it was on TV. The wait there is just as long, the place even more cramped, and the prices the same. Stop being lemmings.",

    "text": "I went to this place this morning (Saturday) around 9:30am w/ a few of my friends. This place was really busy, people waiting outside (10+ people) consistently. (Always a good sign to a great food joint). So I put my name in at the door and we waited 25 or so to be seated. No problem. The people were all in good moods and atmosphere outside was really nice. (They had a few cement benches outside for those who wanted to sit--only wish they had misters!) So when they called your name, they wouldn't just say \"party of 3\" or something they would say \"Sarah...are you ready to eat!?!\" It was kind of funny. We entered this small restaurant and the tables had a nice retro feel to them and it was really bright and sunny. On the walls were decorated w/ Disney art (Snow White being my favorite), the Simpson's and other fun characters. We sat down and were greated rather quickly, but within 2 mins they came back and asked if we were ready...we were like 'whoa!' we haven't even had a chance to review all the options (omlettes, egg sandwiches, french toast, chicken fried steak ,eggs of course, granola/yogurt..the list goes on...). So we made our decisions, and I ended up getting the \"The Mile High - Ham & Bell pepper with diced onions and cheddar cheese\" (subsititute - just egg whites) with wheat toast. My friend I believe got the Wolf Pack (eggs, hashbrowns, toast etc) and then my other friend got the Chilaquiles - a mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce, chicken, sour cream  & cheddar cheese topped with one egg. All looked mighty delish.   My omelette was so butter-delish and had all the right textures, and flavors you could want. The peppers added bold flavor without adding too many calories, the ham and cheese added just enough salt it make perfect. The toast was normal wheat toast, so not much 'wow' there. But complemented the omelette very nicely.   I would highly recommend this place, I am definitely going back. Just leave plenty of time to wait. (As stated--this happens at any good breakfast spots on a Sat./Sun morning). But they seem to move people in and out rather quickly. Speaking of which....it appears my group of friends over stayed our welcome. After about an hour of us chatting girls, the waiter got a bit upset I think because he couldn't turn the table. I guess we should of been more courteous to the others outside waiting in the heat...but we just liked the atmosphere and company so much...we faltered. Please forgive us 'Over Easy' and when we come back...we'll try to not talk to much. :o)",

    "text": "This place is amazing! We didn't realize they stopped seating at 11:30 & got there 5 minutes before they were supposed to stop. Oooops! They were very nice about letting us eat & everything though! There was also no wait at all when I went (with a group of 7), but that's probably because of the time we went.  Everything on the menu looked delicious! I got the half order of caramelized banana french toast (what they're known for!) & the wolfpack. Now, let me say that I don't even LIKE caramel OR pecans, but their french toast was AMAZING! I also like how they do half orders, since I wanted to try the french toast, but also wanted the wolfpack too. The wolfpack also looks a little on the small side when it comes out, but it's very misleading since everything is piled on top of each other. It more than filled me up!  Service was THE best! Our server was so sweet and never rushed us out, despite that we had gotten there so late! Another woman (the owner??) also came by to check on the food and even asked my friend to make sure there were potatoes in her breakfast burrito since sometimes the cook forgot about them. I thought that was nice, since most places won't go out of their way to check if something was left out of the meal.   Also, the server (or the other woman, I can't remember), started telling us about their food challenge called, The Pile Up. It's $30 & includes 12 eggs, bacon, cheese, and hashbrowns. It's $30, or if you finish it, FREE! We asked if anyone's beaten it yet, but so far the answer is no.   When we were leaving, we asked our server to take a picture of our group & she led us over to the side of the restaurant where they have a big OverEasy sign. She was great with the photo taking & very funny.  The inside of the restaurant was smaller than we expected, but they do have outdoor, shaded seating. They also had a tv that cycled through programs, one of which, was part of their episode from Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network.   Overall, this place was great & if they had one in California (where I'm from), I would definitely make it a regular place! As it stands, I'll have to go back here the next time I'm in AZ.",

It really was flavorful and excellently prepared with toasted brioche, spinach, bacon, scallions and au jus topped with a fried egg.  The chef should have left the egg on the griddle a bit longer, per my order for no runny eggs, but otherwise, yummy!   Server started out a bit rough but got better as he warmed up.   Quiet Wednesday mid-morning, no wait and quick delivery of my entree.  Coffee only OK, a bit weak (typical for decaf but it doesn't have to be that way).",

I was almost done by the time I got my toast. The portions were small. Really small. The plates are smaller than average. (I am not one for huge portions, but c'mon, I have seen child's portions bigger than this!) The hashbrowns were unremarkable. The bacon had a smokey flavor that tasted like your clothes smell after being around a campfire. The eggs were ok. The meal barely filled me up. Maybe I got the wrong thing. Or maybe I am crazy to expect an $8 breakfast to be spectacular (or filling). When it is almost $40 for breakfast for three people it better be damn good. And this wasn't.",

    "text": "BACON SAUCE!!!!!   It's mention in the menu peaked my curiosity and honestly tasted good for a couple of bites. But by the end of the brioche I started feeling pretty queezy from the hog fat overload. And I can't help but feel a little out of sorts when I think about Over Easy since. The brioche was also pretty frickin tiny for being on their \"entree\" menu. Maybe bacon sauce is elsewhere without my knowledge, but it seems like a bizarre and gratuitous invention that should be avoided unless you're are heavily intoxicated.  So why do I still go four stars on this place? Probably the time and care put into everything they bring out to you. The menu is ambitious, so I guess they do have time to concentrate, but there is just something to a perfectly made hearty pancake from the right ingredients.  So  I guess this is where you come for no-nonsense breakfast food made perfectly, but as said before, the prices just don't make a lot of sense when you have to keep ordering things a la carte to work off that hangover. Although maybe not as stupid as their 1130 a.m. closing time, even on weekends when hoards of people are still driving up and trying to get a table at noon.",

    "text": "You know, I really wanted to like this place. My boyfriend and I have driven by many times, but never had a chance to stop in until today.  When we walked in there was a gentleman (possibly the owner??) sitting at the host stand doing a crossword - he stopped promptly and seated us.   The atmosphere was cute, we sat outside on the patio and looked over the paper menu while we waiting for our server (you think they could afford to at least laminate the things). When our server came I asked about the Over Easy Ice (basically an iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk and spices) and he pretty much had no clue what I was talking about - he didn't know the menu at all.  We started with the raz cranberry scone with vanilla bean creme freche. It came to the table drizzled in honey and had a huge mound of the cheese on it. As soon as I took a bite I was dissapointed. The scone was stale, like, second day stale. What a bummer, especially because it totally had the potential to be really amazing.  I ordered the mushroom scallion cheese omelette. It was something you would find a Denny's for a lot less. Greasy, greasy, greasy. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon with asparagus - he liked it. His meal was pretty much the only good thing on the table. He got the sourdough toast, which came dry without any butter - not even on the side. It was left untouched on the table.  What a let down. With their hip signage and atmosphere, this place could be so much better than it is.  And for heaven's sake - use fresh scones!!!",

    "text": "Oh man...where do I start? This had to be the worst dining experience of my life. We show up and it's a 25-minute wait for two. Okay, that's normal. But wait, you have to stand outside, and it was 109 degrees today. They had a canopy set up, gee thanks! But how about a glass of water while I wait? Not here! I'm so glad I had a little bit of iced tea left in my cup from AJ's this morning.  So we get seated; get this, outside under an enclosed wooden canopy! Who does that to their patrons in Phoenix in the summer? They had misters, but they were nowhere near us. They had a fan mounted on the patio roof, but it blew right over the top of us and did no good. I think they sell portable evaporative coolers at Home Depot. That would have been nice!  So I'm looking at the menu and trying to decide what I want to eat when I see the waitress bring out an order to a table near us. I'm a bacon freak and I love it extra crispy. The order she brought out had bacon and it was cooked to perfection! Things were starting to look up. When she set the small plate down in front of the little girl, I didn't think anything of it. It was an adequate portion...for a nine year old.  We'll return to this in a moment.   So the waitress takes our order and I excuse myself to use the washroom and wash my hands. So I ask where the washroom is, thinking it's inside. I was politely told it was located in the back...As in, go outside, around the back, and there you'll see them. As I walk around the corner, I suddenly feel as if I'm entering a washroom at a grungy service station. The washrooms weren't clean, weren't air conditioned, and the urinal didn't flush. Can you see where this is going?  So back to my seat, our order arrives, and guess what, it's the same size as what I had earlier thought was a kid's portion.  I'm so glad it was hot and I wasn't super hungry.  So how was the food? Well, the eggs were runny, the hash browns were completely overdone on the outside, but still raw on the inside, and the bacon...well, let's just say that a couple of Band-Aids and that pig would be out wallerin' around in the mud again.  I'll admit. I should have done a little research on my part before eating here, but I seriously doubt I'll go back. At least Denny's is consistent and has clean bathrooms.  I'll give the place one star because at least they had two cool photos of Marilyn Monroe in the Men's Room.",

After reading all of the wonderful reviews of this place, I had high expectations. I suppose that was my mistake.   I love the fact that this place is in an old Taco Bell. The transformation from cheesy fast food joint to civilized restaurant was well executed and turned out really cute. I love the outdoor seating with the patio heaters.   But....when I end up paying almost $15 for breakfast, I expect a little more than what I got at Over Easy. I ordered the Over Easy, a side of hash browns (because breakfast just isn't complete without potatoes!) and coffee. The Over Easy was very tasty. The spinach, egg and bacon sauce were perfect toppings for the toasted Brioche.  I wasn't disappointed with the taste of the Over Easy, but I don't think that it alone was worth $9. It needs something- like potatoes- on the side.   About that side of hash browns- they were dry and required liberal salt and pepper. Pretty disappointing, especially since the saucer sized side dish was $3. (not even kidding about the saucer.)   The coffee was good. If I lived nearby, I might drop in only for the coffee.  This place doesn't live up to the hype. I won't be back, especially since there are much tastier options closer to home.",

    "text": "Had to wait almost 30 minutes on a Sunday morning and got only a counter seat at Over Easy. That's okay, it was worth it. A friend and I split a omelet with smoked salmon, asparagus and spinach and chose home fries. The omelet was tasty but a tad too salty. I'm not sure if it was the salmon or too much salt in the egg. The home fries were tasty but next time, I want to try the tater tots. We also split Reeses Pieces pancakes. At first, all I saw was a smattering of Reeses candies on top of three pancakes. I was like \"That's it?\" But I turned one pancake over and was relieved to see there were candies in the batter. I know that was the least healthiest thing I could have ordered, but no other restaurant offers M&Ms or chocolate chips in pancakes. The pancakes were just right, the thickness of each cake with a soft inside.   Love how they turned what was once a same-ol-same-ol fast food joint into a popular spot of home cooking. The staff seem friendly. While I was there, someone ordered the Big Easy of 12 eggs, 3/4 pound of bacon, home fries, etc. smothered in country gravy. That was one huge muthaf******. The whole staff came out to present it to the customer with the manager taking a picture, LOL. If one person finishes it in 30 min or less, it's free. I have no idea if they put a timer out there or what.  Anyway, looks like there's a wait no matter when you go on the weekend. At least they have a canopy with some benches near by. I'd go here again as long as the wait is under half an hour.",

First time I was taking a friend to the airport, she recommended it as close by and tasty.  It was about 5:45 am and they were closed not to open until 6:30am.  How can a place only serve breakfast and not be open until 6:30 on a weekday?  Try number two, my boyfriend and I were up and about surprisingly early on a Saturday.  I work until 4 am and usually feel like breakfast at about 2pm.  Anyway it was like 12:30 and I decided to try this place again.  We walk up to the door only to be headed off by some hippy waitress who said they were closed. The sign she pointed at stated 12:30 as closing.  They were full with more people pulling into the lot.  I look at my watch and it is 12:34.  Closing time is closing time.    Please consider however that this is a bad economy and there was opportunity for quite a bit more business that day.  I didn't feel any better about the limited hours when the waitress said \"well its lunchtime now, isn't it?\"  Please tone down the perkiness of your observational skills.  Not everyone is a 9 to 5er or for that matter able to handle perkiness during daylight hours.    When these people decide to deliver or have more reasonable hours I will consider them again.  If you are breakfast only you need to be open by 5 or 5:30 on weekdays and not close until 3pm on Saturday and Sunday.",

    "text": "I heard that there are only two good Breakfast places in phoenix: Over Easy and Matts Big Breakfast.  I am a big fan of quality breakfast and am pretty picky about them.  This Over Easy location stops seating at about 11:30am.  Frankly, I think thats ridiculously early so i Inquired as to why.  I was told that they would stay open later, but as a part of their lease they have to close early because they share a parking lot with the neighbors.  Their Scottsdale location stays open later and the menu is exactly the same.    We got there around 10:45 on Saturday.  The wait for a table for 2 was about 30 min. They have a pot of coffee out, with a sign that says \"help yourself to coffee while you wait, we will be happy to add it to your check.\"  Listen up.  If i am waiting to eat at your place, you can at least give me the coffee for free while i wait.  If im drinking coffee BEFORE i sit down.  There is a damn good chance that i will order a cup when i get to the table, just charge me for it then.  I was peeved by this.  Its coffee for gods sake.    Once we got our table, one of us ordered the Pecan Banana French Toast, the other got an Omelet.  The food was good, arrived quickly and the chef came around to several tables to see how everything was.    Contrary to what others said, the portions were average and were what we expected.  The service wasnt bad either.  The place was pretty crowded and they still managed to keep my coffee cup full and the food came out quickly.    I dont think there is really anything spectacular about this joint, the food was good, the menu was standard.  But its pretty good and we'll probably come back.",

You're here to get your morning fill and feel cool at the same time.  Prices aren't bad and would be worth it for a little wait, but not worth it waiting for an extended amount of time.

Initially, this place looks like a run down Taco Bell (surprise, surprise), but once inside it totally works. Unfortunately, it does maintain the same constraints of an old Run-to-the-Border place. This does make for long waits, but I tell you chillins that it is totes worth it. This is one of those places where the food is worth the wait.   For the sake of nostalgia and the added weight of a yelp review, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was not disappointed. The chicken was juicy and well cooked throughout, with a savory seasoned breading corralling all the flavor. The waffles were light and fluffy. You could tell it was all home made. The only knock was the homemade gravy wasn't my can of beans, but I can't be a hater if you liked it. All of this was topped off with fresh squeezed OJ.   So peeps, I confirm the tastiness that is Over Easy. Enjoy. There is a reason to wake up early on Saturday....but not too early.",

Obviously, i asked for  redo since someone else had allready taken a bite of it. 20 minutes later as i hungrily watched my boyfriend eat his meal mine arrived, it was excellent. when the bill arrived we asked for a compensation since it was their error and our waitress says \"but you ate it'. seriously??? on the redeeming side: the manager took it off, no questions asked.

    "text": "I've been to visit Over Easy twice for breakfast. Both visits were on weekends and the place was full with about a 20-30 minute wait. I'm okay with waiting for a meal, and living in Arizona I am okay with waiting outside in the heat for a meal (I appreciate the water station). I am also okay with eating on the patio in the summer (as long as there are either fans or misters and some shade). On my most recent visit to Over Easy my friend and I didn't have tons of time to wait for indoor seating. So, when the greeter asked if we were okay with outside seating underth awning we said okay. The little place is quaint, but the enclosed patio simply needs more ventalation. I feel bad for the servers and wonder how much sweat they've dripped into food.   Speaking of the food, I would say it is perfectly acceptable breakfast food. I had an omelet on my first visit and tried the eggs with mushrooms this visit. I LOVE mushrooms. I can't keep myself from eating them raw when I'm supposed to be cooking them, and I wind up tasting them at all phases of the cooking process. This dish had tons of mushrooms - so many I couldn't find my eggs underneath them. It was just sort of an unattracive murky mess of mushrooms. I could probably have gotten over how it looked if the flavors were impressive, but the flavor was rather uninteresting.   My friend had the standard eggs-bacon-toast breakfast and felt very very okay about it.   I've heard the restaurant is moving into a larger space so maybe I will give them another try when they're settled in to the new spot. Perhaps if I'm not so uncomfortable I will be less grumpy and the food will taste better - perhaps.",

    "text": "There's a cute little spot that is in the middle of the parking lot for the Vig. Because of the exterior facade it actually looks like it could be part of the the Vig's property, low and behold, its a remodeled Taco Bell with cool wood paneling, a small dedicated parking lot to the south side and some of the best offerings for a full service breakfast place this side of...1st Street and Scottsdale Road, south of Camelback...I am doing my best to keep my loyalties and boundaries!...  And, I think its important for me to note, I am an Aaron May fan. I think what he has done is awesome. I appreciate the commitment to quality he consistently provides his Guests, be it at Sol y Sombra or Over Easy. He might charge a higher price than most expect, but it is worth it!  On my last visit (I've been several times), we came in the middle of the week and had blueberry pancakes (10-star-worthy), toast with a side of apple butter (that was out of this world) and I had an egg-white/asparagus omelet (that was delicious, but much too healthy). Let it be noted: Aaron's menu doesn't provide for many 'low carb' options as sides. No fruit, tomatoes or cottage cheese. Only toast, potatoes, hash browns. Me and my waistline had to get over it quickly, I did, and I still come back again and again.  Our server was attentive, patient and aware that we were talking disproportionately to our eating, but gave us plenty of room to drink 15-cups of the freshly brewed coffee, time to try each other's meals and, again, lament that I was being way too healthy for what the menu offers. All of it is delicious.  The food, service and ambiance are great and the space heaters on the patio actually work. I would  easily conduct anything from a business day breakfast meeting to anything similar to a hang-your-head-low-because-we-drank-too-much and need some good bacon grease to absorb the bourbon meeting here too, for an \"over easy\" (not that I've ever done anything like it).  Seriously though, Aaron and his team have surrounded themselves with good people that provide friendly, hospitable service. When you return, you'll find Aaron's friends are his most regular Guests and his parents and/or his sister and his wife are usually stopping by on the weekends - it says a lot when your friends and family come around all the time, because no matter what, they're going to love you - if they're going to pay a tab, and love you, the food must be damn good.",

The first thing to know is that this place is small, I think they had 5 or 6 smallish booths and then two 4-person tables and two 2 person tables between the booths and the bar area, you can sit at the bar and enjoy breakfast though if you don't require back support. Onto the food, the menu has a pretty decent selection. Lots of different kinds of eggs, pretty much any way you want them. They also had food from the griddle available. I played it pretty safe with their 2 egg breakfast as I was a bit overwhelmed from all the choices. I ordered it with poached eggs, toast, bacon and hashbrowns. The eggs and toast were great, so where the hashbrowns but the bacon was way too crispy for my liking.  All in all the food is pretty good, especially if you like really crisp bacon or a nice portion of hashbrowns.",

No wi-fi either. Asked why not, and was referred to the owner. She told me she isn't set up to serve those cheapskates who hang out all day using up her resources. She told me to go next door to the Safeway and eat breakfast there. I couldn't believe my ears. What a way to treat a patron! No wonder so many tables were empty. If that attitude is coming from the top down, there's no hope for this place to improve. I had been a regular customer, visiting on average 3x/mo and recommending the restaurant to friends and business associates. I won't be doing that anymore.",

They were LOADED with blueberries and topped with powdered sugar, they just melted in my mouth, my 10 month old tried blueberry pancakes for the first time and loved them as well.  I ordered one scrambled egg for my little one and she gobbled it right up!! The egg was cooked perfectly, buttery and fluffy.  I also ordered a side of bacon, crispy, delicious and flavorful.  The only downfall is the place is pretty small, but the food makes up for that :)  The menu doesn't have a huge selection, which is refreshing as most places hand you a book to look over and it takes you 30 mins just to decide what you want.  We will be going back soon!",

There was a guy walking around asking every customer if everything was OK and if they had a problem he would quickly resolve it, come to find out it was the owner, he even came to our table and with a big smile asked how everything was.

I would have called the meal more like unflavorful migas rather than chilaquiles.   My partner in crime got the chicken and waffle.

We arrived on a Sunday morning to find a packed parking lot, a line around the side of the building and didn't know what we should think.  We were able to park next door at the Vig and went to the host; we lucked out and immediately got seated at the bar.  The stools were comfortable, though a bit unique style that nearly thrust you forward to the counter. Nearly as soon as we sat, we were provided with a tall glass of ice water and a waitress saying she'd be with us in a few moments.  The menu was simple to navigate, the food options looked fantastic and the cook staff in the kitchen were firing on all cylinders.  My ham steak with hasbrowns was great, though it lacked the flood of gravy I had sought.  Wife's breakfast was equally good.  On my way out, I got a cup of the house iced coffee.  Flavored with cinnamon, cardamom and mint, it was a bounty of spice.  Though, I wish I'd tasted it before I left.  I would've added more sugar.  A good meal, perhaps worth the wait.   Best if you can get right in.",

If I'm not in love with it the first time, then it's not looking so hot.  First time I tried one of their signature dishes the caramelized banana and pecan french toast.  Sorry it was completely toasted on the outside and soggy and eggy on the inside.  I'm not a picky person either, but that's kind of a turn off when your toast is not done... yet too done on the outside.  My husband had the Hopple Popple, which was fine.. it's just didn't stand out.  Then for my second chance, I had a hankering for chicken fried steak, which many have recommended.  The only thing it had going for it was the gravy.  I will give them that.  Otherwise, it was fine..

Turns out inside there were a grand total of two tables and counter space. Our party of four ended up at the counter facing the open kitchen of a converted Taco Bell setting.   Overall, the food is pretty average. Had the french toast and my husband had the brioche with bananas. Hash browns were pretty good.

It's two sips off a iced coffee, but what a crazy rule. So I ask to speak to the owner, literally seated yards away - \"he's in a meeting\", so they go get the manager. Still have not stepped foot in the Resturant. Still outside. Lovely Arizona hospitality!!! No manager arrives. Eventually I give up.   Go down to the right and visit The Black Cat Coffee house. What a difference. I have my food in front of me, the staff are great. I got in first try. Avoid the over easy. Stick to black cat",

    "text": "We fell \"over easy\" for Over Easy!  The draw to Over Easy was the media publicity. It was one of the \"Top 50\" restaurants featured in the Arizona Foothills Magazine and made the spot light, not once - but twice on Food Network.  First on the \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" for their famous waffle dog and second on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  My fiance and I arrived around noon and saw a few people waiting outside.  We were in no rush, so the wait was not a problem.  I would say we waited about 20-25 minutes before a table finally opened up.  While walking to our table, I couldn't take my eyes off of the cute animal umbrellas hanging overhead (which they advertise available for purchase).   Ready to Order, we decided on the \"Over Easy\", which is a toasted brioche with sauteed spinach, fried egg, bacon, scallions covered in a natural sauce and the \"Fried Chicken & Waffle\".  The \"Over Easy\" was Ok.  I feel it would have met my standards if maybe a different bread was used? Though the The Chicken & Waffle...AMAZING! The chicken was crunchy and slightly over salted to compliment the sweet and savory waffle...but it did not end there! Luckily one of our servers noticed that we failed to read over the menu and neglected to make their \"secret sauce\" for the waffles! He politely came over, grabbed a side plate and prepared it for us! He poured the maple syrup on the plate and drizzled it with hot sauce then explained how this is their signature concoction made special for this dish.  It was delightful!   Several reviews lowered their scores due to poor service but I am happy to say that we had an attentive and entertaining experience! I agree that they could pep it up a notch but overall, they delivered!  We both left with satisfied tummies and a souvenir tee!        TIP:  Arrive early or expect a wait. Order the Chicken & Waffles and don't forget the sauce!",

    "text": "First time in for brunch. This place like many other breakfast spots in Phoenix is BUSY!! If it's a day off or a holiday expect to be on a waiting list for a table. We waited about 25min. I imagine that it's always a tad hectic in there, but today they were really getting their butts handed to them. They were slightly understaffed due to someone not being there so it seemed like the staff were a bit stressed out trying to keep up. Lucky for them the owner showed up and jumped into the fray to help get things back on track. Other than the food taking a bit longer than I would have liked, it wasn't that bad. I didn't get hangry or anything.  My wife had the avocado Benny which was nicely presented and she said was really good. I had originally gone in there to have their chicken and waffles but I got sidetracked by the chicken fried steak. It was a chop steak breaded and Fried smothered in white country sausage gravy and I got sunny side up eggs on top tater tots on the side. I love chicken fried steak and this was a good one however I have never really liked white country gravy. It's not that it was bad it's just that every time I've had country gravy it's always just bland paste I always have to add salt to it, and I rarely salt my food. I also added a little hot sauce to give it some help. Like I said it's not the gravy wasn't good it's just that I don't like that kind of gravy and I keep forgetting that. Otherwise it was a great meal I'm definitely gonna go back as there are about 10 things on the menu that sound amazing! They even have something called a Thanksgiving waffle which is stuffing cooked in a waffle iron and covered and turkey and gravy! Totally original! Definite food porn!  Our server was friendly and efficient despite being stressed out. It should be noted that the girl who Who brought our meals asked if there was anything else we needed I said ketchup. She nodded and was never seen again. I got the busboy's attention and asked him for ketchup. He mumbled something to the affirmative and also disappeared into the abyss never to be seen again. When our server came to do a food check on us I asked him for ketchup and he made it back from the black hole that the other two got sucked into and delivered my condiment. Like I said the place was a little bit overrun and the staff was flailing. However if breakfast food is your thing then you must try Over Easy!",

Unfortunately, something happened to our order, and the server had to take it again about a half-hour after we first placed it, but then we continued to wait another 30 minutes for it to finally arrive.  I would have given Over Easy a second chance, but we were sitting right next to the host table, where two people were helping seating people all morning.  I have to believe one was a manager.  Either that or there was no manager on duty.  No manager ever approached our table and apologized for the delay.  Nothing.  I was in a party of two and the party of four next to us was almost done eating by the time we got our good.  And they came in maybe 10 or 15 minutes after us!    Things happen, but the food wasn't good enough to bring me back and I was really disappointed at the lack of urgency or awareness by the staff.",

They relocated from by the Vig to a shopping center on Indian School Road.  I had the sausage benedict over a jalapeno cheese biscuit.  The biscuit was dry, the eggs were overcooked (not runny when you break into it, but the sauce was pretty good.  The hash browns on other diners' plates looked soggy so I asked for mine to be made very crispy, and they were.  We also tried the banana pecan french toast.  it was okay, I have had better.    Coffee sucked - it tasted smoky or burnt and they don't have lattes, what the heck?  Service was outstanding and it was obvious they were concerned about satisfying diners as they asked how everything was and if you would come back (I overhead them asking the latter question to other diners but didn't ask us).  Too many other good restaurants to try then to go back.  Sorry!",

Ground beef formed in a hamburger patty with a crispy shell since it was battered. The steak is smothered with a white gravy that contains onions and tiny pieces of sausages. The dish also comes with a choice of eggs and potatoes. I had the hashbrown and it was cooked to perfection! I love the outer layer of my hashbrown crispy and hate it when it is not cooked to that point.   The fiancee had the loko moco and I had a couple bites. The loko moco is cooked hamburger patty smothered with dark gravy sauce under a bed of rice and topped with grilled onions and fried onions and finally a choice of eggs. The loko moco was decent but I did not prefer the flavors since the gravy tasted like red wine and parts of the rice was burnt.   We ordered the caramelized bananas and pecan french toast. The fiancee hates bananas and asked our waiter not to include the bananas. But when the ordered came there was no sauce or pecans so I think there was a misunderstanding. We sent it back and asked for the sauce and pecan and let me tell you, if you do not like bananas, just order the plain french toast because the sauce also tasted like bananas.   Another thing I tried that sounded interesting thing on the menu was the over easy iced coffee. The drink had too much cinnamon taste and did not have as much coffee or sweet flavor that I wanted.   Service (3 stars): Our waiter was busy waiting on a lot of tables, if anything it seemed like he was the only waiter there! I felt bad for the guy. We had a problem with our order and another person had to fix the problem since our waiter was too busy.   Ambiance (4 stars): Cute 50s style diner decor! The menu is also very cute.   Overall, I might come back if I am ever in town and if I am craving for some chicken fried steak!",

Everywhere I go I order eggs over medium and very few restaurants get it right. The chicken fried steak was very tender. I felt like the steak could have been fried a bit longer. Not too crunchy. Hash brown were a bit dry but still good. The gravy was fantastic. The service was excellent. I watched the two guys who worked today and they were on it. If I go back (I may since I am here to the end of the week) I will try either the LocoMoco or their Wolf order or eggs benedict. Coffee was hot and nice. If I lived here I would be a regular. There are just a few things that they could do to get a four star from me. All in all, I still recommend it. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. I liked the openness and the airy feel to it.",

I was not a fan of the brand of cranberry juice they sell but diluted it with water and managed to get it down. The food. Can you really go wrong with breakfast? The hamsteak, eggs and home fries were uneventful, average at best nothing spectacular here. I did not enjoy the redeye gravy. It was bitter.

He had warned me that there might not be any seating when I arrive, but for a Monday brunch, there were tons of available seating.  The service was excellent, and we were checked on 3 times!  I think once was by the chef or owner.  I ordered the Brioche French Toast for $6, which was light, fluffy and not overly sweet.  The presentation could use some work, but it all went down great.  The coffee was just okay.  The okay coffee is overpriced at $2.25, and I regret not trying the Over Easy Ice (\"cold brewed coffee with cinnamon & cardamom, mixed with sweetened condensed milk & mint\").  I wasn't reading the menu too carefully because I was too busy practicing my Spanish with my friend.  I like that the serving sizes are not disgustingly huge and the prices reflect that appropriately.  I also appreciate that a half order of the French toast is an option for mixing and matching entrees.",

They use a wonderful brioche, and I love that they offer a half order of french toast. They serve REAL maple syrup and serve decent coffee. My friend really digs the Wolfpack - come hungry!    What to try? the Waffle Dogs - they're big fat yummy sausages dipped in waffle batter served with real maple syrup and Cholulo hot sauce. Sounds weird, but tastes wonderful!    I also love their healthy choices - egg white omelets with your choice of ingredients. My only wish? That they offered a chorizo and egg burrito.   Have kids? They have some GREAT kid-friendly choices with decent prices - chocolate chip pancakes anyone?  Come early - there is always a wait on the weekends!",

Each of us ordered something different and were very disappointed. The eggs were extra small and over cooked, hash browns were mushy, omelets were burnt on the edges, ham steak was tough and the red eye gravy was about one teaspoonful on the plate. The corned beef hash wasn't any better than Libby's out of the can.  We don't plan to eat here again.  I guess when you know Guy Fieri is coming in you make the food look better and probably taste better. Too bad!",

Everything is very delicious and the hosts are so kind and hospitable. If you come here, you must get the waffle dogs! Even though the waffle dogs seem like nothing, they are quite splendid!  you cannot be disappointed with any dish here.  Although the wait to get in is about 15- 20 mins, the wait is worth it.  The only reason this review is missing a star is cleanliness. Maybe its because I'm really picky when it comes to food and restaurant cleanliness, but the overall atmosphere has to be perfect to get 5 stars.",

My wife had the Pollo Loco omelet which was good as well.  Good stuff and reasonable prices.  However, if you enjoy the following, Over Easy is probably the place for you.  * a crappy parking situation * a 20 minute wait (which isn't that bad if the place is worth it) * being so crammed in that you are basically sitting on top of the people next to you * being ridiculously hot because they couldn't spring for more/better fans or an outdoor A/C thing (my fault for going in September but tons of people were standing in line to be crammed and hot so I thought I could stick it out) * bad service (god forbid they ask you if everything is ok, if you need anything else, or want a refill on anything but water)  Oh and if my server is reading this, I am still waiting on my toast you said, \"would be right out\".",

I popped in and had the (I don't remember what it's called), it was the Mexican one. It had strips of tortilla's and a sauce with an egg on top. The sauce was really good, but the entire dish was, overall, just average. It was the dish the server recommended, too.   I'll probably stop by again if I'm in the area. This time, I'm having the Eggs Benedict. Person next to me had it, and it looked AMAZING!",

    "text": "My dining companions and I were visiting relatives in Arizona and found Over Easy on Yelp.   I had been loading up on eggs and beef for the last few days so decided to have something lighter and healthier for breakfast. I ordered house-made granola and yogurt, with a side of fresh fruit.    One of my dining companions ordered the same and another ordered brioche French toast.   The granola was nothing special--sweet and bland without fruit or nuts. Frankly, it has all the character of granola bought at a grocery store. The yogurt was vanilla flavored. The fresh fruit was lovely--strawberries and blackberries that were ripe and sweet.   The brioche French toast was good but not great.   Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, because at tables all around us, the big plates of yummy-looking traditional breakfast dishes kept coming.  I kept wishing that I had ordered the full-fat, full-calorie breakfast burrito or chicken-fried steak, because they looked delicious and the people who ordered them looked very happy.   Coffee: Mediocre. Just like every place else we tried in Arizona, the coffee tasted like Folgers. I think it's simply how Arizonians prefer to drink their morning Joe. Go to Starbucks if you're craving a cup of delicious dark roast.   Ambiance: Noisy, hipster with a youngish family crowd. Not too much screaming, though.   Service: Mediocre. I had to go to the counter to ask for more coffee after our cups sat empty for at least 20 minutes. The manager was apologetic and said one of her wait staff had walked out that morning. But the service seems to be a consistent problem here based on other reviews. It was mobbed and there was not nearly enough staff to handle it.   Bottom line: I'd try it again during non-rush hours, and would stick to the fully-loaded traditional breakfasts.",

That being said, they make some tasty food at reasonable (but not specifically cheap) prices.  My personal favorite: the Selena burrito.  This is a gigantic burrito that comes with whatever you want, but the base item is shredded hash browns.  I omit the meat and usually get tomatoes and onions added and I love it.  It is two meals.  The burritos come with a small cup of fruit, and wouldn't you know it, it's GOOD fruit!  Not the standard stingy fruit cup of watery, old melon slices with a few sad red grapes.  No way.  This fruit cup includes lots of fresh blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries alongside the typical sad fruit items (I hate melons and grapes).  Dang!  It's in the details and this one really impressed me.  We ordered for work once and they were friendly and fast (if not slightly strained) with our 25-meal order.  There wasn't a single mistake in the food items or the bill.  A record?  Probably.",

Things are made from scratch like the cheddar-jalapeno biscuits (spicy!) and the corned beef hash (some of the best ever). We also tried the Wolfpack, layers of cheese, bacon, and hashbrowns. The hashbrowns could have been a little more brown, but that is the only complaint. Drinks were quickly refilled and service was friendly. The layout is really tight quarters and lingering is not invited, so keep that in mind depending on what type of breakfast/brunch atmosphere you are looking for. But, certainly the food is first rate.",

The toast did not taste like sourdough and looked like it had been put in a sandwich press instead of a toaster, plus it was cold and unbuttered and the butter served was cold so it just sat there on the toast and the jam was runny.

I then asked if we could add an additional chair to our table of five, and they looked at me as if I should leave because that might be too much work. I ended up finding my own chair when nobody was willing to help me.

I hesitated to move outdoors as it was already past 10a and very hot, but I just couldn't relax at the counter.  Thank goodness I'd already checked out the menu online and pretty much decided what I wanted to try- the chicken-fried steak on a waffle. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=MhktxOxPp_sKrzK6tJoR_Q#MhktxOxPp_sKrzK6tJoR_Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_o...</a>  I'd misread that the actual dishes were a $9 plate of fried chicken on a waffle and an $8 plate of chicken-fried steak, country gravy, egg, and choice of potato, but no worries as my server allowed the substitution and charged me $9 for a fried steak on a waffle.  I decided to brave the hellish heat over the hurtful deafening noise indoors and moved outside.  I must've looked pityful wilting out there that a kind young man asked if I'd like him to turn the misters on.  Patio-area is actually quite homely and invting, and I was pleasantly surprised that there were misters installed- for some reason I didn't think many people would welcome cooling condensation on their eggs.... My OE experience was starting to improve... While I enjoyed the flavors and textures of the steak and delicious waffle, I didn't think that the small amount warranted a high price tag. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=L4kyavImBPIfIAdVmi1D_g#L4kyavImBPIfIAdVmi1D_g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_o...</a>  I had to ask the server if the waffle was indeed that small.  I could see paying that price for two waffles and a steak...  After eating all the crumbs of my dish, I went ahead and ordered a chocolate waffle w/out the powdered sugar from the kids' menu.  I expected to see a chocolate-colored waffle, as I assumed that the homemade sauce was mixed into the batter, but no, it was the same malted waffle w/ homemade sauce drizzled with a heavy hand.  If you're like me who prefers the crunch, you might want to ask for the sauce on the side.  (A nice addition to the menu would be a chocolate waffle topped w/ vanilla bean ice cream and homemade sauce on top!)  Can't for the life of me think why I didn't take a photo of the chocolate waffle, so forgive me for its exclusion in the photo set.  Oh yes, the sauce is OK.",

    "text": "With the addition of Over Easy last week, 40th Street in Arcadia is becoming more and more of a hip restaurant row. Retro chairs [see photo] and space-age stools dot the interior of the cozy joint owned by Sol y Sombra chef Aaron May.  The place, which is next door to The Vig, recalls a Matt's Big Breakfast feel (and was so alluded in Java magazine) for this side of town and manages to do so in an old 1970s mission style Taco Bell.   I wouldn't have been able to tell if I didn't know. Regardless, the food here is delicious and compared to other places I did not feel like I ingested a tub of butter. I ordered the hearty Wolf Pack with a pancake on the side and I was in heaven.   Two (count them, TWO!)  layers of hash browns [see photo] with two scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and strips of bacon in the middle. The eggs were just the right consistency and hash browns were browned just right and tasted terrific with garlic salt and pepper. A fluffy griddled pancake with syrup on the side, fresh squeezed orange juice and a complimentary New York Times at the counter also greeted my morning grumpiness and I was quickly satiated.  Altogether the meal came out to $12 + tax.  A bit pricey, but worth it knowing you get what you pay for.  I briefly talked with the chef's managing partner who went into detail about the tater tots with tomato jam (that I missed on the menu) and the bacon reduction sauce that comes with the brioche.  My only complaints would be minor.  Small quarters: With about half of the seats outside on the patio, it's probably a few seats more than MBB.  There was brisk business yesterday on a weekday morning, but on the weekend I can see how the crowds would grow.  A la carte-like menu: This is a trend I'm not particularly fond of, especially for breakfast. Several of the entrees don't come with either eggs or potatoes. The Loretta breakfast sandwich are examples of entrees that don't come with eggs. The Over Easy brioche and omelettes don't come with potatoes. The wait staff just shrugged it off as, \"Oh you can just order [blank] on the side.\"  I disagree, especially when you're paying nearly $10 for an entre or omelette.  Semi-scattered staff:  Everyone was friendly and engaged in small talk with people at the counter.  But after asking twice for my check, I figured it was a small blip in the overall experience.  Delicious breakfast food with a cool hip feel? This neighborhood will be all over it.  I'm looking forward to the next visit.  EDIT: 1/19/08 -- OK, I'm upping this to 4.5 stars.  Service was excellent today.  And the country fries (and tater tots with tomato jam)  were outstanding.  They were deep fried with seasoned salt, parsley...yum!",

    "text": "They know what they are doing with this breakfast thing. I typically get sweet stuff, but on both trips to Over Easy I ended up ordering the Chilaquiles... I cannot resist them. Handfuls of tortilla, tons of cheddar cheese, mixed with red chile sauce and succulent chicken, topped with eggs your way.  The only thing I find odd about this place's menu is that they have no avocado... Not on the chilaquiles, not in the omelet ingredients list, nowhere. Oh well, I digress... There is a counter with seating, so you might get lucky and have the option of sitting there, otherwise be prepared to wait 20-40 minutes on a weekend. It's a fairly small joint, but they get the food out fast and keep the customers moving at a comfy pace. The service has always been good as well.  I've promised myself I will get something sweet next time I go... We'll see!  ;)",

Today I went to brunch at Over Easy with a party of 4 (that's the way to go by the way, so that you can taste  a bit of everything!)  Needless to say, we'd all had a few too many drinks last night, and we needed a good greasy spoon, fill your tummy, type of meal.  We arrived around 10:15 on a Saturday and had about a 20 minute wait, but it went by fast and was so worth it!  Brian hooked us up with a table inside and our server brought us ice waters and coffee immediately.  There were so many menu items that sounded amazing, so we decided to start with the waffle for the table as an appetizer.  Yum!  (It's got a vanilla malt flavor that is out of this world good!)  We also ordered a side of crispy bacon for the table - such a treat!  I went with the egg white asparagus omelet and added mushrooms to it plus a side of hash browns.  The asparagus was seriously some of the best I've had and I cleaned my plate!  Jared went with steak and eggs over sleazy - it looked so good I had to taste it and that too was fantastic!  The other couple we were with enjoyed their entrees too.  Although I didn't try them, the 'tots' looked good and I would suggest hash browns or tots before the breakfast potatoes.  As you can imagine, this was a ton of food for the four of us, but since we were all hungover and hungry, we did pretty well with it... With tip, I think the total for all of us was just under $60 - it may seem expensive, but it was worth every penny!  I usually like some fruit, tomato, yogurt, or cottage cheese options.  That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I think they keep it simple because of their limited space in this location.  With that said, Chef Aaron May and his team are on a roll with great restaurant concepts and I'm definitely a loyal fan.  I'll be back to Over Easy again soon as well as continue to frequent Sol Y Sombra and the up and coming new restaurants when they open as well!",

We had a 20-25 minute wait when we arrived so we grabbed a coffee at the coffee shop, a couple of stores over.  The hostess was accurate with how long the wait would be.  The service was good.  Our server seemed quite serious but she caught our joy after a few minutes at our table.  Service was good and our food was great.  D had his eggs, over easy of course!  He also had the blueberry pancakes, which we all sampled and found to be dense.  I like my pancakes light and fluffy... these were not.  L had an omelette, that she described as \"delicious\".  You're able to create your own omelette, with 3 ingredients of your liking.  I was very tempted to create my own too but instead decided on The Mediterranean.  I loved my omelette, which had lots of flavor!  If you are not a fan of garlic, you will not be a fan of this particular omelette!  The hashbrowns were also very good.  I would absolutely order this meal again. Over Easy has a fun vibe and lots of great choices on their menu.  They also have a nice selection of healthy choices too.  I look forward to my next trip to Over Easy... I might get their fancy iced coffee with cinnamon & cardamom, sweetened condensed milk & mint. YUM!",

What really did it in for me was when the bus staff removed my plate before I was done, as well has very aggressively cleared the table next to us that we couldn't hear ourselves think. Again, the food was good but not excellent and the service makes it less than desirable to want to return.",

Unfortunately the maple syrup is nowhere near as good as Matt's or Palette (the best syrup in town) but still pretty good.  But what really makes this place better than Matt's is that they really do CARE about you while you wait (what a concept).

I had the sirloin and eggs with Camelized onion and Jalapenos. What a unique and well done breakfast combo.  Steak was tender and plenty of it as well, the jalapenos and onions packed a great punch against the creamy and perfectly cooked eggs. The problem is there are so many good things on the menu I will just have to come back to try them all, deciding what to order was a dilemma to say the least.  My dad had the Salmon Benedict. He said it was the best breakfast he has had in a very long time. Perfectly poached eggs and homemade hollandaise sauce were key according to him, but the real star was the thinly sliced fresh and smoky salmon.  I guess this will be the next thing I get!

I had the chicken fried steak and subbed a cheddar jalapeno bisquit for the potato. The CFS was tough and stringy; so bad a cut if meat that I had to spit out in a napkin the last bite I could stand to eat. The meat flavor was non-existent. The breading just as bad. It lacked any approximation of seasoning and tasted like fried corn starch. The gravy was just as bland and the sausage buttons they added to it were pink and undercooked. The bisquit was undercooked and pasty inside. Sorry, it was just that awful.  The other entre we tried was the chicken fried chicken with a waffle. Sad waffle. The sort of waffle that has so little rise to it that it didn't fill the iron and looked more like a waffle puddle. Flavorless as well. Ive had tastier toaster waffles. The CFC was dry and had the same starchy breading. We had to ask for butter and the waiter brough some and a small plate. He explained that the chicken was best eaten with sauce and proceeded to squirt syrup and hot sauce in the plate. It was better that way but nothing special.   A bad day for the chef? Or just a bad chef. Hard to tell but we'll never be back.",

I ordered the mushroom chicken omelet (Pollo Loco). It was good and they were not at all greedy with the cheese.  Every bite was just a string of cheese after a string after a string... Makes me wonder how much cheese I actually consumed.    The chicken was a little dry and unflavorful, but I still ate til I was full. Service was mediocre.

    "text": "3 Stars due to lack of customer service/experience. My gf and I arrived this morning and her mother was meeting us and about 5-10 min away.  Because there was only 2 of 3 there the hostess refused to seat us. I said I get it but there are plenty of open tables, not to mention I see at least 2 people seating at 4 tops. She she they were \"about\" to get busy. We went to the bar and had a cup of coffee and few minutes later her mom arrived. I went back expecting to be seated at an open 4 top and she said no it was being held for a party of 8 outside. I got a little frustrated and said, so you wouldn't seat us, we were here, you had tables, now the third person is here and you still won't seat us? Anyways went to the bar, had breakfast. Bar staff and most staff was nice, food was good. Had chicken and waffles. Now, the reason why Sam Fox has sooo many successful restaurants, customer service. Houstons, Banderas great customer service. Mom and pops placed fail because they refuse to embrace and train their staff properly. It would have been appropriate for a manager (she was there and aware of us) to come, apologize for any inconvenience or mis communication but she didn't. She ignored us all together.",

Seating crowded, they put too many tables and chairs in the place - waitstaff and customers have hard time moving about.  Tables so close together could not hear own conversation.  Waiting area in direct morning sun, extrememly limited shade - it was 97 degrees at 10am and blistering to wait the 15 minutes on a Sunday morning, and then so very uncomfortable inside.  Had to flag down waitstaff for order and for a coffee refill.  Lemon pancakes tasted like undercooked, oversoaked French Toast.  My coffee cup was dirty and cracked.  Maybe they got too busy and couldn't handle the uptick due to the TV shot.  Won't return.  (Oh, couple at the table next to us got waffles and were disappointed with their food as well.)",

    "text": "I know this place had been featured on Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives. I was more interested in it because I had heard vague rumors they may be opening up one in my neck of the woods and wanted to see if I could start building a relationship with another breakfast place.  Noon on a Monday found the place mostly empty, which caught me a little by surprise. With the whole Food Network exposure thing, I figured there would be a wait. I am sure there is at peak breakfast hours on weekends.  Breakfast is the only option here. It's our first meal of the day, so even though it's noon, breakfast is fine. They are only open until 1:00 so, breakfast only makes sense.  I probably should have listened to the server and ordered the DDD featured item, chicken fried steak. I, instead, opt for the Loco Moko, a Hawaiian staple, with two eggs on top of a hamburger patty on white rice, all covered with mushroom gravy and topped with \"crispy\" fried onions, which were kind of limp. My wife had the traditional eggs Benedict. Prices for our dishes were, I believe, $9.50 and $10 but I don't recall which was how much. When you consider I got eggs with plain white rice and a burger patty, two poor mans staples, the price tag seems a little steep,   Although the gravy on mine was tasty, neither dish really blew our socks off or stood out from any breakfast dish I've ever had. We actually had gone about half an hour out of our way to try this place. The breakup may not be complete yet. If the rumors are True and it's not clear across town I may give the chicken fried steak and/or waffle dogs a try. I might still find something to make me swoon.",

The hollandaise was flavorless, and the English muffins were way bigger than the eggs. I was craving eggs Benedict and was very disappointed. My friends seemed to enjoy all the food they got. The only thing that I like besides the coffee were the waffle dogs. I'm only giving a 3 star since my friends had a better experience than I did. If I come back, I will definitely try something else.",

The bananas were definitely too ripe and ended up being hard to chew. The caramel was very maple-y flavored and wasn't my favorite. I had originally planned on ordering savory but talked myself out of it and I regret that.   For the good, they had fresh squeezed orange juice that was delicious. The others in my party ordered steak & eggs and the Wolfpack. Steak was very flavorful but possibly too much gravy on the plate. My brother ate the Wolfpack so fast there was no chance for a picture.   If I ever found myself in Phoenix again during breakfast time, I'd probably give it another try and order something different.",

We ordered two items featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. Wow! Get the caramelized banana French toast, it's divine! I also got the Wolfpack which is just so intense and heavy. It's basically bacon and cheese sandwiched between hashed potatoes!   Love this place it's definitely a hot spot, a must see and do! Our server was lovely and the whole staff is very hard working and kind. My only discontent would be that the food came out slow, we waited nearly 20 minutes for our food... But it was worth the wait every second of it!! By the time we left the wait looked pretty rough.

The service is typically very friendly and the hostesses are always super sweet.  The cheery color scheme is wonderful to wake up to in the morning when enjoying a delicious breakfast.  The food:  OMG!  The eggs benedict are the best I've ever eaten from the quality of the English muffin to the perfect poached egg, nice slab of ham and over-the-moon tasty hollandaise sauce.  The pancake dogs (?) are spectacular and come with real maple syrup.  The chicken and waffles are fantastic with the juiciest piece of breast meat I've ever tasted.  Oh and the jalapeno biscuits and gravy?  Where do I begin?  I don't usually order biscuits and gravy at restaurants because they are often very disappointing and I have a very discriminating palate when it comes to my B & G.  I've never had better anywhere in my entire life and that includes diners in the Midwest and deep South.  The iced coffee with the cinnamon and cardamom seed and sweetened condensed milk is to die for...be careful though...it packs a caffeinated punch for sure.  My only criticism is that the hash browns rarely come out warm and fresh, but then again I'm not there for the hash browns.  If not for the hash browns, I would have given this place 5 stars:)",

    "text": "Food = 3 stars Service & Atmo = 5 stars  We came here because of my DD&D's app, which maps out all the places Guy Fieri has visited.  Yes, there's a wait, but not so bad.  They quoted us 25 minutes and we got in in something like 8 minutes.  The tables & chairs are 50's style retro.  Very clean with a fun look.  The place is a little crowded and you'll be sitting almost elbow to elbow with your neighbor, but it's friendly and kind of fun.  Gotta say I was pretty disappointed in the French toast with \"caramelized\" bananas.  I'm not a big French toast fan but our server encouraged me to order it saying that it was the dish that made them a star on television.  The menu says \"caramelized bananas\" but really they aren't.  They are fresh bananas with some very bland homemade caramel sauce on top.  When I mentioned to the waiter that I thought the bananas were supposed to be caramelized, he said, \"yeah, they're bananas in caramel sauce\".   Sorry, but that doesn't qualify as caramelized.... when I told him the \"caramel\" sauce wasn't really sweet and was more like a neutral gravy, he again countered the comment and said that customers had complained that they caramel was too sweet so they changed the recipe.... ok, fine, but it doesn't really qualify as \"caramel\" when it's almost neutral tasting, barely sweet.  Just figured first timers should know this about their signature dish.  The bread was so-so, the caramel sauce isn't sweet like you'd expect and the bananas are fresh sliced.  The dish in my book was pretty bland and not worth spending the calories on.  To make it up a very boisterous friendly man, probably the owner, brought me something else and really made it up with his attitude.  Another plus is real maple syrup on the table in a squeeze bottle.  Would I come here again?  For the freshly made pancakes which were awesome, yes, but I'm a little skeptical now when eyeing other things on the menu since they are a little loosey goosey with the descriptions... \"caramelized\" may not mean caramelized and caramel might mean \"non buttery gravy.\"",

If your a penny counter you'll be turned off by price, but its fair and you will leave extremely full and satisfied and not bale to finish it all. The sweet stuff is sweet and the spices stuff is spicy, but that is what any logical person would think. The food is why you come so choose on of the items on the menu and enjoy. Excellent place to EAT.  My wife and i go her about every 2 weeks and we love it. Reading the other reviews i think some of these people don't understand what the place is. This is a diner style breakfast place. The tables are packed in and its a cozy place where you can easily see what your neighbor ordered. You come her for the food. Its a creative twist  and stepped up form traditional breakfast. the wolf pack is wonderful as is the waffle dogs. The omelets are huge and the french toast is amazing (although a bit sweet for my taste, have them leave the camel sauce on the side if you don't want desert for breakfast) . The prices appear to be a bit steep at first but the plates are huge so the price is fair. As for service, I've always had good service there but I'm expecting a diner. its not a white table cloth place so speed is on their mind and you appropriate that as breakfast food is never good cold.   Over all it a wonderful place with amazing food. well forth the hype.",

I decided that Mother's Day with my grandparents and mother would be a perfect day to do so.  I made sure we got there early enough to avoid the crowd.  There were about 6 empty tables (not busy at all) and we got sat immediately.  Unfortunately, we sat there for about 20 minutes while all the waitstaff completely ignored us. Had to finally ask a busboy to find out who our server is. He said he wasn't sure. The lady who sat us said to the busboy she didn't know who was our server either (not sure if she was the co-owner or manager or whatnot). She had to practically beg for someone to take the table. Its a SMALL place, so I heard the lady loud and clear. I got up and left after that, taking my family with me. Over Easy = Over FAIL!",

Our service was passable for a busy day, but could have been better considering every single server had to go past our empty coffee mugs every time they went to the kitchen, yet the empty cups sat until \"our server\" came by again. Like I said, it was busy, but coffee with breakfast is pretty much the main priority that any server could take care of (and does in most breakfast places). Everything else about the service was good though, and I liked our server.   I strongly recommend the jalapeno biscuits. They exceeded my expectations and I will definitely have them every time I go. The rest of the food was good too, but the biscuits are what stuck in my mind. I will definitely be back here because it is close to home, but I'll keep looking for a favorite breakfast place too because this one just didn't have the homey vibe that I like.",

    "text": "I have not eaten here. However, I will not eat a location that uses Hickman farm products. The sole purpose is because using these products forces female inmates to work in their facilities. Although that may not seem bad look at it this way:   1. They claim to pay a higher wage to their \"employees\" yet they actually only pay the inmate $0.30 an hour as well as pay the additional $14.70 to the department of corrects. Any money that an inmate makes is supposed to go towards any restitution they may have post their release. Makes the IRS look like a puppy, right?  2. They do not allow these women to shower or change before returning to their prison yard. This means they return covered in chicken feces. Once they return, they go through the typical strip search which leaves aforementioned feces on the floor for other inmates to stand on in their bare feet.   These are pieces of the puzzle and the fact is that I have first hand knowledge of these events. If I were you and didn't have that knowledge, I would not believe it either. You are welcome to disagree with me if you would like.   I would love to try this restaurant but with a clean conscious I cannot. If there is anyone from in their management that is reading this, please feel free to do your own research. I agree with desiring to use a local business and applaud that.

It was okay, i probably wouldn't order it again. The hashbrowns were soft and definitely needed more time on the griddle. We also split a malted waffle that was one of the best waffles I've ever had, awesome! Wifey had this omelet with feta, spinach and tomatoes that was also very very good. The service was good as well. I also had an Over Easy Iced Coffee that was brewed with cinnamon, cardimom (sp) and mint that I thoroughly enjoyed.

    "text": "We bought the LivingSocial deal to try this place out a few months ago but haven't had a chance to try it until this morning. We came right around 7:45am and were the 3rd table in the restaurant - a blessing because we wanted to make it to work on time after our fancy breakfast (anything compared to a homemade shake is fancy).  We seated ourselves and were assisted within a few minutes.  I would say both our orders came out within 15 mins - not too bad for what appeared to be very fresh, hot food.    I read the previous reviews and figured I would try something that was a \"typical\" breakfast choice for me: the Mediterranean omelet. I considered creating my own (I'm one of those slightly picky people about what I have in my omelets) but felt the short but mighty ingredients in this omelet would hit the spot - spinach, garlic, tomatoes, and feta. What's not to love? I skipped the variety of potato options in favor of an English muffin. Although I love me some potatoes, I'm really glad I did!    I love love love cold pressed coffee and was very interested in how they prepared their Over Easy Iced [coffee]; with cinnamon and cardamom, followed by sweetened condensed milk (the best thing ever to add to coffee) and a hint of mint. I could envision how the first three flavors would work together but didn't know how the mint would come in (and I'm not normally a mint person).    My husband, a complete sucker for almost any configuration of eggs Benedict, settled on the Deli Eggs Benedict (I called it - the salami was calling his name).  He chose a half/half order of regular and sweet potato tots and eventually caved, at my insistence, for the iced coffee too.    I loved the homemade strawberry jam that came with my English muffin - not too sweet and a strong strawberry taste. Our server told us the jam they were using before were not up to par for them so they switched to making their own - works for me!  I polished off half my English muffin before I turned to my omelet.  Personally, I thought my omelet was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. I was worried that it would be one of those three egg behemoths that is more appropriate for lazy Sunday mornings but thankfully it was normal-sized (they have three egg omelets though, if you are interested in a behemoth meal). I loved the combination of flavors, it wasn't runny inside (not something I mind but I know there are people out there that need their eggs cooked through), and I felt there was a good balance of all the ingredients, not too much or too little of anything.  I complemented my omelet with a few (okay, a puddle to the side) of Chohula hot sauce - you can never have enough of that stuff!    I ended up really liking the iced coffee - since it was cold pressed there isn't the normal bitter after taste that you can some times get with coffee. Instead the after taste was a marriage of cream and mint with just a hint of coffee. I thought the mint could potentially muck it up but I found myself really liking the after taste. I was worried about having major garlic and feta breath but the coffee (emotionally, I can't speak for real life) put my fears to rest because I was able to wash the tastes away and leave only the cream and mint.  It was less sweet than I expected, but then I didn't feel like I needed to either - and I normally put an obscene amount of sweetened condensed milk into my coffee or black tea. Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal.   I'm not always a fan of eggs Benedict - the hollandaise sauce is usually too much for me in the morning. However my husband was quite happy with his meal - the eggs were perfectly poached and the man loves himself some extra sauce and it was plenty saucy for him.  He can't turn down anything with salami in it so it was just icing on the Benedict for him (har har). The amount of taters he received was epic - it took up at least half his plate!  I only sampled the sweet potato taters (How can you walk away from fried sweet potatoes?) and they were quite yummy. He assures me, however, that the regular tots were just as good if not better (he assures me he is okay but I'm not sure what's wrong with him - sweet potatoes are awesome).    We had no issues with service through out our meal - we were checked on once or twice, which fine with us.  Check out was quick and we were done and out of there by 8:45 am, a miracle for us (I am a SLOW eater).   By the time we were finishing up quite a few tables had filled up, so if you want more of a quiet breakfast, we definitely recommend this to early risers.  Our experience was good and we'll be visiting again to try other things as their menu is large and promising (loco moko, French toast, and the breakfast sandwiches come to mind).",

    "text": "They won me over. I may be the only person on planet Earth that does not like the Chilaquiles. But I ordered them, and didn't like them. The owner, Brad, came to the table, simply said, \"Different strokes for different folks. What else can I get you?\" And the new order was promptly served.   AWESOME, people!  My 1st visit, when it was at the old location, was uninspiring. I was just not all that impressed. After giving it a 2nd try, I'm glad that I did. And since then, I've made a 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th subsequent visit. All of them equally pleasant and enjoyable.  I do need to say that there is a hostess who is unable to modulate her voice, and when she calls people to their tables, renders all people within 10 feet deaf. And... When she called my name, she called the wrong name because she wasn't paying attention. After being yelled at 3 times asking me \"Are you Joe? Are you Joe?\" I waded my way through the noise, looked at the list, and politely informed her, \"That doesn't say Joe.\" and smiled. What's the deal with that, you may be asking? The 45 minute wait would have been longer had I not been paying attention.  That said, a must go. I'm a fan of Brad's and his staff, and service first, and the food second.",

There's more space and yet the atmosphere is still warm.  The food is delectable and comforting, which is exactly what I love about a good hearty breakfast.  Each dish of theirs has a unexpected touch that makes it unique to Over Easy and I can't help but feel as though they don't miss a beat.  All ingredients are fresh and the options for healthier meals are present as well if you're feeling as though you want something a little on the lighter side.  The pricing is reasonable and the portions are solid.  I am so grateful for the new location in that it's a little less crowded and the service is always friendly, prompt, and warm.  I can't wait to go back for another weekend breakfast!",

    "text": "Over Easy has gotten too big for its britches... They've jumped the shark!  Just visited the new location and came to the conclusion that this place thinks its too good for their own customers.  The food is slightly above average, don't get me wrong, but it's nothing to rave about all things considered...  The wait was over 30 minutes, which isn't a problem when you at least get a decent greeting from the restaurant owner.  Instead, he seemed more focused on churning cows in and out of the restaurant.  This theme continued,...   Our server was sweating profusely -- sweat literally dropping off his chin as he took our order. After taking our order, he never checked on us again.    I then watched the old woman at the door absolutely bitch out a customer.  Now I have no idea what was said from the customer and maybe they deserved a good yelling at, but the customer was with her 6 year old daughter when the older woman who worked the front door demonstratively punched open the front glass door, screamed at the customer, got 2 inches from her face and pointed angrily at her until she and yer young daughter scurried off.    Then we overheard the older woman telling the owner what happened and the owner basically said \"good for you\" for screaming at the customer.  Just one of many examples of why this place isn't good enough to take your money, they think they are above the customer and we are just a number.    My farmer's omelet was just OK at best, slightly above room temperature but badly burnt on the edges.  My wife's chicken and waffles were average at best and she wished they chicken was crunchier and more flavorful.  They removed their cappuccino and espressos from the menu, though the coffee was excellent.  Over Easy has gotten too damn big for their britches. This joint needs to go back to trying to offer decent customer service.",

As for the food, it was very good but not the best I've ever had for breakfast. My group started with the waffle dogs which is basically a corn dog with breakfast sausage inside. It was pretty good because it was very light but a little bland. The waiter mixed hot sauce and syrup together which took the whole dish up a notch.  I chose the chicken fried steak which was extremely good, the batter was light and had a lot of flavor. My friends got the mediterrian omlet, a breakfast sandwichs.

It's right next door to The Vig, and is always busy on weekends, which is the only time I can make it in. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the joint, with Formica tables and a retro, midwestern feeling to it. The only drawback for me was that the tables may be a little too close to each other, and if you are not totally thrilled with being a part of everyone's conversation, it may not be the spot on a *hungover* weekend AM. I had the Wolfpack, which is a layering of hash browns and scrambled eggs, with bacon throughout. Pretty good, but I was thinking at the time I could use a bit of salsa, or at least a stripe of Sriracha. Price-wise, it was a bit more than a Waffle House, but less than a Rita's Kitchen. So, that would be - two dollar signs... I also tried the Over Easy location at the Ice Den up on Bell Rd. Much more quiet when I was in there, but that might not have been a good thing. This is the better of the two, IMO.",

The chicken fried steak was average but nothing spectacular.  But the pecan French toast was TO DIE for.  After being there for over an hour and a half we finally talked to the new owner and he apologized.  Trying to explain that the easier foods get bumped to the front of the line for the cook.  And so ours was way in the back of the line of orders, even tho we were there before many other people.  He compinsated us our check and we didn't have to pay for it.  That was very kind of him, considering we didn't even ask for that.  Would try again and see if we get a better experience next time.",

    "text": "Been here before and thought it was ok-good. Saw the piece on Diners drive ins and dives and wanted to try it again. The place was packed, and I had to wait for a table, but after 10 min or so got a nice one inside with a view of the kitchen. I order ed the chicken fried steak, my friend had the wolf pack. The food took about 15 minutes, but came out hot and looked great. My chicken fried steak was one of the best Ive ever had. the hash browns were great too. Not to salty, but perfectly crisp. Speaking of hash browns, the wolf pack was loaded down with them. very good, but I was glad I stuck with the chicken. Staff was friendly and the place is cool. ill be back for sure.",

    "text": "Went here for breakfast today after seeing on the food network last night. The wait wasn't bad for a Sunday morning - about 10 minutes. I have to say that it was elbow to elbow seating as some have suggested. It was comfortable. We ordered three different things. 1. an omelete - which was no better or no worse than anywhere else - although the has browns were way overdone/overcooked. 1. breakfast burrito - this was actually pretty good. 3. their touted brioche carmelized french toast...This came out cold and if you're expecting anything like they present on TV, you'll be very disappointed. The carmel sauce was just a drizzle at the bottom of the dish, the bananas were just 4 of the smallest little banana circles i've ever seen and the pecans where just a spinkle of nut crumbs you'd find at the bottom of the jar of nuts. It didn't have a bad taste, just underwhelming if you expected what was advertised on TV...All in all, not a bad place for breakfast,but nothing to go out of the way for..",

    "text": "EWWWWW!!!!! Over Easy is absolutely disgusting.  Thinking about the food right now makes me want to puke.  I was in a party of 2 and the nasty food took about 30 minutes to come out.  The toast was your basic supermarket brand white bread and it was old and stale.  The omelet was a JOKE! It was burnt on the outside and under cooked in the middle.  I am not kidding that this was the worst omelet I have ever tasted.  The M&M pancakes were disgusting also.  I thought that the M&M pancakes would have mini M&Ms cooked inside the pancake but I was wrong.  The M&Ms were just doused on top of less than satisfactory pancakes.  The drinks may have been the worst part.  The strawberry lemonade with rosemary was very bitter and the flavors did not compliment one another very well.  We also got the iced coffee that was tasteless.  I cannot believe that Guy from the Food Network put this place on his show.  I have been to three other restaurants endorsed on his show and they have all been fantastic.  If you are looking for a good place to eat breakfast in Phoenix Matt's Big Breakfast is definitely the place to go.",
