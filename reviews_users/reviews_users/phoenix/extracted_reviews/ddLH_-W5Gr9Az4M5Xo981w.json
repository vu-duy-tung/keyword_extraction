Came here again recently and realized that the menu and presentation is almost identical to Yupha's as well. Wait a minute. Who am I fooling - I always just get the red curry from the lunch menu anyways so I wouldn't have noticed any difference. :P I'd say quality is the same as Yupha's. It's just a little further away but it's on the lunch rotation for when we're craving Thai but don't want to run into folks from work. In the same mall as Teakwood's and Jersey's Tavern. Plenty of parking.",

    "text": "Best Thai food I've had in the valley. After trying other restaurants in the area now that I work down in Chandler, I happened across this spot and decided to try it on a whim. I'm glad I did, and this is where I'll be continuing to go for my Thai fix for the foreseeable future.   I tried a classic - yellow curry - and chose a medium spice level to establish a baseline for future visits. The lunch comes with soup and salad, and while the salad dressing was good, the hot tofu soup was very flavorful and just spicy enough to taste the heat without burning away the flavors.   The yellow curry itself was exactly like I love it. Unlike the watery, thin curries I've had recently at other places, this was rich and creamy with an excellent flavor. The medium heat was just enough to linger on the tongue during the drive back to work without making me sweat at the table.   Recommended.",

I felt the fried rice needed a touch of flavor it was a bit bland but the Larb was phenomenal. we choose the medium spice and it was just right. It had enough heat that you knew it was spicy but not so much your mouth was on fire. I had the Thai ice tea which is always great. and for desert we had the coconut ice cream with fried bananas and the sticky rice with custard. Both deserts were excellent.  I was disappointed that they no longer have toppings for their ice cream as I wanted to try the coconut ice cream with sweet pumpkin.  over all it was an excellent meal.",

Most of the staff seemed disinterested in serving us and were running back and forth between the kitchen and dining area. Our server only half paid attention and served us one order of spring rolls instead of the 2 we ordered. Very mediocre at  $5.99 for two rolls, glad she only brought one order. It sounds like an exaggeration but we sat and waited for our entrees while other tables seated after us were served and eating.  We had one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, a Thai seafood entree that I can't remember the name of right now. It had a nice chili spice but was heavy with sugar which was overpowering. The Drunken noodles were OK but nothing special. Sadly we have no desire for another trip to Thailicious, there are much better Thai and Vietnamese offerings in the east valley.",

We love the Steamed Seafood in Love, the broth is incredible. The Tom Yum Fried Rice is excellent as well, but VERY strongly seasoned; we usually 'cut' it with plain rice 1:1 and it still tastes great, plus you have plenty of leftovers. Kids love the drunken noodles, and my wife and teenage daughter really love the Panang and yellows curries. I usually go for the Holy Basil, great flavor also. I don't know that you could go wrong with nearly anything on the menu.  We usually get takeout, and always cook up extra vegetables (Stir fry veggie mix from Costco) to eat with what's provided, and can easily get two meals out of an entree.  The restaurant has a cool, understated vibe on the inside. The service could use a bit of improvement, but the ladies who work there are very friendly (though sometimes a bit difficult to understand). Highly recommended!",

Service is excellent, restaurant is clean and the food is great. We ordered the Pad Thai and the the Drunken beef noodles. The beef noodles were absolutely delicious, top notch really. I was not swept away by the Pad Thai though. Despite it being really good, it's not my favorite version. It seems to me that there are two versions of the Pad Thai sauce, one sweeter than the other. This happened to be the sweeter one which I'm not a big fan of. The food is quite spicy so be careful what spice level you order. I ordered my Pad Thai mild and it was slightly on the hotter side for me. I happen to like spicy food but honestly, my tolerance has gone down recently so you be the judge. Portion size is pretty good. You don't have to ask for your cold water, it'll come to you in a nice jug with glasses and it doesn't taste like tap water! Overall the food is great therefore we will be going there again any time we make it to Chandler!",

The lunch time specials were good for the price but what is really worth it is dessert, Thai tea creme brulee! It's so good that it makes you feel like you got roofie for all three Hangovers .",

    "text": "Updates: I haven't been back here for a while and was craving for Thai food again. I was looking forward to good food as well as saying hi to the owner, unfortunately she was very busy helping out in the kitchen when I got there. This place is a whole lot busier than the first few months when it was opened. Still clean. Still spacious. Everything is exactly the way I remember it.   Service: Service is still great. Even after the bill was paid, they still come by to check up on us and even offered to give us to go cup for more sodas. We politely turned it down but thought it was very nice.   Food: I ordered a Thai basil dish with beef and it wasn't as good as Basil fried rice. Beef doesn't have much flavor on it and I can hardly taste the basil flavor. We also ordered egg rolls and it was pretty decent.   Rating: Overall I still think it is a good Thai restaurant. I'll come back here again to try some other different dishes.",

I came here for lunch and found my usual pad prik king, so I was excited to try their version of it. There weren't any tables available but there was some room at the bar.   The bartender (if you can call her that, since she spent probably an entire 60 seconds behind the bar the whole time I was in there) ignored me until I waived at which point she said \"you ready?\"  She took my order, didn't tell me about the salad / soup bar, and left. It was the last time she spoke to me. I actually had to flag another waitress to refill my water and bring the check. At least that waitress was pleasant and helpful.   The pad Prik sauce was too sweet and unbalanced. The soup wasn't great either. The salad dressing was really delicious, though.   They didn't give me one reason to come back, so I probably won't.",

The coconut soup was pretty good but defiantly not the best I've had from a Thai restaurant. I ordered it mild and it had a good kick to it.   The curry was really good. It came with plenty of sauce. So much so that I had about a cup left over.   My husband really liked the Pad Thai. It was a very big portion. He ordered medium and it was spicy. We like spicy but it wasn't a typical medium.   Overall this was a delicious Thai place. We will defiantly order from here again.",

Upon inquiring, found out they have opened this restaurant and moved here. They were very gracious and eager to please which was a stark difference from how I have been feeling about Yuphas lately.   The lunch buffet comes with soup and salad. I thought soup was tasteless and unappetizing. But the taste was made up by the entrees.  The food was as good, if not better than Yuphas. Loved my ginger beef with rice. All four of us loved what we ordered. And then we ordered sticky rice with coconut Ice cream. I thought it was pretty awesome.  If they keep up with the quality of the food And great customer service, I don't think I need to go back to Yuphas and go through their deteriorating customer service and food quality.  Look out Yuphas, your ex-staff is out there to beat you in your own game :) I have to say, it's a must try for every Thai food lover!",

The soup, which you get yourself from a salad bar, was too sweet and lacked flavor.  It was just thick, sweet, flavorless, soup.  The salad bar was iceberg lettuce which isn't unexpected and it did have nice sizes of sliced tomatoes. The dressing was like an off the grocery shelf type Thai salad dressing. Nothing special. The pad see ew was not remarkable.  The broccoli was all but missing. The egg undetectable. The Garlic Lover also had tiny amounts of \"steamed vegetables\". We were told there was no shrimp in the Garlic Lover (which I can't eat) and perhaps it was heavy fish sauce flavor, but we both tasted heavy shrimp flavor.  The only really good food on the plate was the rice and  Thai crispy roll.  We won't be back.",

The food here is great!! The tum yum soup is amazing!!! Spicy with a hint of lemon. I definitely recommend it to all!!! The drunken noodles also are great!!

Noodles I ordered came with fried tofu with egg at level 4 spicy (hot). The flavor was impeccable and certainly a treat for those \"drunken\" fans out there ;)  Also ordered the red curry - though kind of runny I felt the taste was surprisingly good. Not usually a fan of curry at Thai restaurants but glad I made that exception.  Lastly Thai iced tea - great drink at any Thai place - tall glass and not too sweet!  Overall great experience - recommend to those who want to try something new on Thai!",

It was fairly spicy, but next time I'll ask for \"5\". The dish includes rice on the side, which I appreciated. That way I could decide how much rice to add to my plate. The Pad Prik Khing has a good portion of green beans, which were cooked just right - they had a nice snap, not mushy at all. I asked for fish sauce with diced chilis, and they brought out a little box with that, plus chili sauce and chili flakes. I only tried the fish sauce, and it added another layer of flavor to my food. Recommended!  Cost: I paid $12 including tax, which I felt was very reasonable.  Service:  Outstanding! The place wasn't crowded at all, especially for a Saturday evening. Well, it was really early, so there's that... Anyway, I was greeted and seated immediately by a very friendly hostess. She brought me an ice water with lemon slices right away, including a carafe for refills. A different person took my order, and only 13 minutes later she brought it to the table. Impressively prompt. Several times during my meal someone came to ask how everything was, or if I needed anything else. This was just right, not enough to be annoying.  Atmosphere: Nice. They were playing fairly quiet jazz music, and water features near the entrance and near the rest rooms also added to the mix. The decor isn't over-the-top Thai, but it's tasteful. Also, the men's room was very clean - always a good sign!  Overall: This was a very pleasant experience. Good food, good service, and an menu with enough interesting choices that I'll definitely be back!",

They have a 2 big screen tvs on both sides of the place and a nice little bar area smack dap in the center back of the room. It's close to my job so I thought today was the day I go check them out during my lunch hour.  Service is friendly and fast, I was arrived a little after 11:30, it was still slow, I'm sure the lunch rush was coming soon. But I was able to pick any place to sit.    After checking out the menu I went with the Heaven Ginger with chicken, it was ginger, onions, mushrooms, bell peppers & scallions in a house bean sauce and a side of steamed rice & crispy roll.  I also ordered it Thai Hot.  The heat was a little lacking for me, it was more like a level 2 not a Thai Hot, the flavor of the dish was good too, it just seemed to be lacking something, it was an ok dish, it wasn't spectacular or mind blowing, just a good lunch.  The salad was a typical iceberg lettuce blend with carrots and to add to it some sliced cucumbers & tomatoes with a warm peanut sauce dressing and the soup was a sweet & sour soup. The peanut dressing had great flavor just a little runnier than I like, I like it a little thicker so it sticks to the lettuce leaf and not just run off the leaf. The soup, it was surprisingly good, it had the perfect blend of sweet & sour.  Thailicious makes a decent lunch, not spectacular, but good. Didn't have anything wrong with my meal, just didn't get blown away.",

    "text": "In honor of my YFF being today's ROTD holder, I declare an end to my review hiatus.  Thailicious has sat motionless in my bookmarks for months, ever since mon ami Kristin J first alerted me to its existence.  The name alone evokes images of \"superlicious delish\", as the superlicious Mary A states.  The characters in this screenplay are as follows... Joyce W - my YFF and international essay contest winner, who I shall refer to as J-WoW.  If you want to read an actual well written review, check hers out. Linh L - one of today's top talents in beat-boxing, who I shall refer to as Mr Peanut.  If you want to read an actual amusing review, check his out. Brett B - the author of this autobiography, who I shall also refer to as Mr Peanut The Waitress - who I shall refer to as Flo  As an author, whose responsibility it is to convey an experience to you, the reader, I hope you'll be able to take away this... I arrived AND checked in prior to either J-WoW or Mr Peanut!  After 'handshakes & hugs', we gangsta strolled up into that beyaaaa...ah.  What a sight it must have been.  Two of us could have passed for cast members from the Asian version of Melrose Place, while the third closely resembled Zippy the pinhead.  We were promptly ushered to a booth with what appeared to be vinyl seats, and I make this distinction to inform the reader that as I scootched myself across the bench, an inopportune vibration was simulcast from the vicinity of my pants bottom.  Not wanting to appear like a wind-talker in front of my co-diners, I made an effort to replicate the sound by continuing my side-glide until successive audible vinyl rubs were rendered.  But no such vindication was attained...  My companions were a True delight.  Dear reader, may you be blessed with your own J-WoWs and Mr Peanuts.  Lunch doesn't always have to just be about binging on 1800 calorie entrees.  Open your heart, and your heart may just open you back.  I ordered the Pad See Ew, vegetarian style as a nod to my girl Cici F.  Now, I'm down with PSE, yeah, you know me.  It's my jam.  The dish gets my merkin a twerkin... however this one didn't have the je ne sais quoi of Thai Spices or Thai Rama, but that didn't dissuade me from a raucous display in which no less than half of the deadly sins were involved.  After putting in our dessert order, I asked Flo if she would be so kind as to provide me with a spoon, say... eighteen or nineteen inches in length.  Now here's the kicker.  She looked at me like I was a damned fool.  That delightful Thai Tea Creme Brulee dessert proved to be the meal's Swan Song. It boasted a sun kissed glow that could have passed for San Diego's own TM, a consistency smoother than my girl MC J, and was reminiscent of everything that's right about pumpkin pie without the benefits of high protein or dietary fiber.  How is no one singing its praises?  [Chorus - Nicki Minaj, J-Wow & Mr Peanut:] Flo, I got this short-azz spoon in my hand Beating like a drum on a treat that's all tanned Can't you taste that creme, bacreme, creme, creme, bacreme, bru, lee? You got that creme brulee creme, bacreme, creme, creme, bacreme, bru, lee Yeah, that's the creme brulee (Creme) [x15]  Side Note: If you enjoy leering at beautiful women from the shadows, as they make selections from a salad bar, then boy are you in luck!",

    "text": "#200:  It was an action-packed day!  Celebrating my 200th review on the day I just so happened to get ROTD made for a fun day with the boys!  What better way to celebrate than with a Thai Tea Creme Brulee that we've all been dying to try?  After a little while, our food arrived.  The Pad Thai was nothing extraordinary or spectacular but I enjoyed every bite.  I was really impressed by the portion given that it was lunch.  For $8, I got myself not only lunch but dinner!  I'm interested in seeing how big their dinner size is now.  Anyways, after nom noming for a good while, we were ready for the grand finale:  Thai Tea Creme Brulee!  It was probably a 10 minute wait before three Thai Tea Creme Brulees were placed before us.   Not wasting time, I gleefully grabbed my spoon and cracked the most beautiful caramel shell.  That first bite made fireworks go off in my head.  It was Chinese New Year and I had front-row seats on Victoria Harbour... which is weird because we're at a Thai restaurant and not Hong Kong... whatever!  This is my review so bite me.  Reminiscent of warm pumpkin pie in texture, it was creamy perfection!  It was smooth and the Thai tea flavor really hits you and it was delicious.    At $18-something a pop for beverages, lunch, and dessert, I definitely think Thailicious delivers.  Good portions, great atmosphere, and friendly service.  This place gets packed around noon so come prepared.",

We also had the green and massaman curries.  The only thing that keeps this from being a 4 star restaurant in my book was the service.  Our waitress was very polite but not the most friendly, and it was obvious that she had a huge workload (she seems to have been the only person taking care of every customer in the joint, and she was also working the cashier), but we did not receive any water refills during our stay (my friend jumped up and grabbed an additional pitcher from the counter for us when it became obvious that we wouldn't get another), and we weren't ever offered additional rice (we resorted to drinking the curries like soup). Fine but not ideal.  Still, not a bad place for some late-night food!",

    "text": "Thailicious= delicious! We were excited to try out this new restaurant based on the great reviews. Nestled in the Laguna Village shopping center, it's nice to see another Asian restaurant take over where the previous Szechuan restaurant was. They've remodeled the place, adding color, new seating and tables to create a soothing, contemporary atmosphere with an Asian twist.   The menu is fairly extensive and has all your stand-by favorites such as pad Thai, drunken noodles, and your various forms of curry. They also have some more unique dishes and chef's specialties. I decided on a more pedestrian entree this visit, settling on the chicken red curry, medium spiciness. I also tried some of the tom yum soup and the holy basil chicken.  The tom yum soup was a delicious pungent mix of spices and flavors. It was a great start to our meal. The red curry sauce had an interesting balance of delicate flavor from the coconut milk, with a strong punch of spice and kick from the curry paste itself, and the chiles used for heat. The spiciness level was a perfect medium- just spicy enough to tingle your palate and tongue, but not so spicy that you'd be in pain afterwards (Or drinking gallons of water!). While I enjoyed the sauce and the vegetables in the dish, the chicken in the entree was overcooked and tasted pretty tough. On the other hand, the holy basil was divine. The chicken was tender, cooked perfectly, with a great mix of veggies and flavors.   One bowl of rice comes with the entrees, which I appreciated, but I would have liked to see more rice included because the meager portion wasn't enough to eat with the lovely red curry sauce I had.  We ended the meal with some Thai tea creme brulee. It was a unique twist on a French classic, executed wonderfully. I would definitely order it again!  Service was decent, and waters were refilled as needed.  Overall, a pretty satisfying meal. I'd definitely go here again to try more dishes!",

Can you believe it? We were then asked how we were doing, and we ordered drinks, including a much too small Thai iced tea.  Waters were brought our without asking (points scored right there) and a carafe of ice water was left on the table (more points again).  My sons water came in a to- go cup with a lid, also much appreciated.   Spice level 4/5 was perfect for me, but I am the type if person who puts Sriracha on everything.   The Tom Kha kicked my butt it was so good.   It was served in white clam shell shaped bowl and is enough to share.  It was packed with fresh semi crunchy veggies and thin flat strips of chicken. The spices were dead on. I have been to other Thai places that make their soup all about the heat.   What surprised me the most was the fried ice cream for dessert.  Enough to share among four people, the outer donut shell was chewy and sweet while the chocolate syrup with perhaps a cherry sauce was a great way to end the evening.  It",

My friend had the lunch chicken ginger heaven with a Thai roll, salad, and rice for $7.99. When asked by the server what spice level she wanted, she blurted out \"ZERO\" and that is what she got. She said the food tasted good even without the spices.  There are booths and tables, the place is nicely decorated, and parking is close to the door. The salad and soup are a serve-yourself deal. Parking is close to the door. We plan on visiting again soon.",

You honestly don't even need the chicken because it's loaded with flavor though. Let me stop though, because I'm starting to think that this review is exclusively on yellow curry.   The customer service was great. They were super nice and friendly. Didn't take long to get our food. Oh and the dumplings are amazing (appetizer)!

I went with a friend after yoga last week (sorry Thailicious for our smellyness!) and we were a little wary since it hasn't been open long and when we entered it was mostly empty. Well, our wariness was unnecessary, this place was great. I asked the waitress what I should get between the noodle soup and the drunken noodles... she so delicately said.... ummm lots of.... white people... order drunken noodles. Ha!!! I ordered the noodle soup with beef at her suggestion. When the soup came out I was worried... it looked kind of gross... like brown water. Oh my god this soup was good. So flavorful, like a mix of a Thai soup and a pho. Tons and tons of flavor. I ate it all. I was planning on taking half home for lunch the next day. Uh oh. I ended up deciding to order another dish to go so I would have lunch the next day and got the drunken noodles. This portion was much larger than the soup, so I was able to eat it for two days. I will say, at a 4/5 star, it wasn't spicy. Also, though good, it didn't touch the flavor of the soup. I will come back here for that soup, so good!  Cons include - expensive for the portion size (can usually make at least two meals out of a 10$ bowl of soup, but not so here), the drunken noodles were not the best I have had, and they put a big mass of carrot strings on their noodles as garnish... don't really get this, why not put the carrot in the noodle mix? the carrot garnish was a little odd after heating the rest up the second day.",

The bad: I had the pad Thai and it was awful.  This was due in part to it being tipped with spoiled bean sprouts. However, I still think the pad Thai would have been subpar given its excessively sweet sauce. I ordered it 4 (hot) and I would say it was mild or medium at best.    My husband ordered the Holy Basil 5 (Thai hot). It was medium spicy as well. Both plates were very skimpy on the meat. We ordered chicken and pork (respectively) and maybe had 5-7 pieces of meat on each dish.   They did void my pad Thai so I didn't pay for it. Despite the good service, the food just wasn't good enough to warrant a return visit.",

    "text": "I wasn't really impressed, but I didn't have a bad experience.  I had the Masaman Curry with chicken; which was tasty (very sweet and creamy), but the portion size was pretty small, with very little chicken.  The potatoes in the dish were a bit too firm and almost crunchy.  My dinner date had the pad see ew noodles, and he liked his.  I did notice that we both asked for a spicy rate of \"2.\"  Mine had zero spice and his was a lot more spicier than mine; yet we both asked for the same level of spice.  Diner beware, this can really ruin your experience if a restaurant does not know how to control the spiciness of their entrees.  Wasn't an issue for us though.  We also ordered a pot stickers appetizer that turned out to be rather bland.  I've bought frozen pot stickers from the grocery store that have had more flavor.  I had to laugh that someone else commented on the background music of this restaurant; I find the choice in music to be odd.  The layout and decor of the restaurant doesn't look very well established or well thought out.  It wasn't very busy at all and one employee was running all of the service in the dining room.  With all the good Thai restaurants around, I wouldn't add this to the list of options.",

This is too bad because I was looking forward to that and the price is the same!  Is it that hard to pack a salad or soup?    Anyway, the red curry sauce was excellent tasting and the spice level was right on. However the chicken tasted a little like freezer burn and was over cooked. The spring roll was very good.   Overall not a bad lunch but could have been better with the soup and salad and fresher chicken. I was hungry 3 hrs later and for 10 bucks plus 2 dollar tip I wanted a little more. Next time I'll eat it in!",

I saw that the coke on the menu from Grubhub was 2.50 or 3.00 I can't remember exactly and was expecting a 2 liter of coke. to my surprise I received a 12 oz can of coke. I tipped the driver 10 dollars and called the store back.   I was really upset with the lack of customer service and the lack of understanding and had to return the order. It was a lose lose for both parties and I would be careful ordering from this restaurant in fact I think that they stopped taking deliveries last night.",

The warm peanut sauce... Yum!!!!  I got the green curry with beef - medium spice. - the beef was very tough - the eggplant was thinly sliced so the usual melt in my mouth eggplant feeling was missing - spice level was on point and the portion was huge  My friend got the seafood pad Thai - mild spice. - the seafood in it was still raw.... They probably could've cooked it a little longer. On the bright side, they put plenty of seafood in it -missing something that I can't figure   My boyfriend got the Thai basil fried rice with chicken and i think it was the best dish of all 3.  - chicken was extremely tender - everything was just on point!!!  The food isn't bad, i probably wouldn't return because there's other Thai food places closer to me that's better.",

I ordered the Pepper Beef lunch special, and my wife got the Drunken Noodles with chicken. Flavors are typical for Thai fare, but nowhere near the heat range from the number of stars ordered (they use a mild thru hot range vs stars, 3 is supposedly medium but tastes like a zero).   Takeout lunches did not come with soup or salad, just the Thai spring roll (which was nice and crisp), and the portions were TINY compared to nearby Swaddee Thai (our favorite Thai place so far).   Called to let them know about the lack of spicy in the dishes, got a couple of sorries then was hung up on. Yay.   Fun fact: they have punch cards!

When you first enter, you realize how well laid out this restaurant is, not super formal, not super casual, somewhere comfortable in between. It's spacious and well laid out. We were greeted with a friendly smile and taken immediately to a comfortable booth.  The service was prompt and extremely friendly. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. We ordered satay chicken appetizer and a few entrees.  The satay chicken was the best I've ever had. It was served with the best peanut sauce and cucumber sauce I've ever had as well. The Penang and pad Thai were incredible, also the best I've ever had. My Mom's dish had chicken and shrimp and mushrooms and a sweet brown sauce, can't remember the name, but it was delicious! For dessert, we had coconut ice cream. Again, the creamiest, best coconut ice cream I've ever had in any Thai restaurant or possibly anywhere else. The food was hands-down excellent.  So, here are my ratings: atmosphere is an eight. Service is a 9.5. Food quality, taste, temperature, spice and quantity were outstanding, 9.5.  Presentation is beautiful.  This place is clearly not a chain type restaurant. Not exactly a hole in the wall either. It is clearly privately owned by people with old world recipes, quality ingredients, and truly care about the experience of eating in this restaurant. It seems to be frequented by Asian folks, and they clearly know their Thai food.  Of all the Thai restaurants I've been to in Arizona, I would return here first, hands down.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I'm a mostly vegetarian eater and am a huge fan of curries. I'm also a creature of habit so curry dishes tend to be mostly what I gravitate towards.    I'm constantly craving the delicious Green Curry (with tofu) entree from Thailicious. I love that you can customize the level of heat...I go for the T'hot which gives just the right amount of heat imo.  Also I'm surprised this isn't listed in the \"What's Good\" section because this dish is superb and deserves to be there.  But even more than the main entree, can I say I am OBSESSED with the Tom Yum Chicken Soup. The perfect blend of hot and sour, and if you ask them to use tofu instead of chicken, it's an even bigger treat.  Order a pot because you'll want it the next day for sure.   I've ordered this same meal several times now but last time decided to try the Thai iced tea, and fell in love with that too.  This go around when I went to pick up my food, I got to the car and realized I made the mistake of forgetting to order that tasty tea.  So I ran back in, and explained my dummy move and was given my iced tea on the house!  That was such a surprise, it was seriously the highlight of my really bad day....so thank you to the kind hostess whose name I didn't ask.  Lastly, sides never get the glory they deserve, so do yourself a favor and get a side (or two-I regret not getting two) of the \"cucumber sauce\" and sprinkle over the soup or over your entree....or literally eat it with a spoon like me!  That's it folks, this little gem of a restaurant would be a perfect place to try if you haven't already.",

Little displays of graciousness, like pouring my beer for me are completely absent.  We ordered Calamari, a beef dish, Tom Yum soup and a duck dish.  Everything, and I mean everything we ordered had a sweet flavor to it, as though someone cooking it meant to add salt, but mistook the sugar jar for the salt jar.  My wife's duck dish was dry, although not badly flavored.  The Tom Yum was very watery with very little ingredients other than mushrooms, and of course the shrimp I had ordered.  Calamari was okay, albeit a bit too sweet.   My beef dish's sauce was quite watery and very lightly flavored, even though I had ordered it and the Tom Yum at a \"3\" level of hotness.  Very mild.  Considering the competitive nature of restaurants I would have thought they would do a much better job.  What may be an acceptable level of service in Asia is not acceptable in the US and that is something many, many Asian/Indian restaurants around Phoenix need to learn.  Raise your game, guys. I have yet to find an Asian/Indian restaurant around here that really blows my socks off.  I am a world traveler and I have seen it done much, much better elsewhere.",

    "text": "Our experience at Thailicious was anything but -licious. We arrived, a party of four, for an early Sunday evening dinner. We were greeted with delay, as the host was also the primary cashier for every other party present. The host eventually got around to acknowledging our presence and seated us. Again, with about a 10 minute delay, our drink orders (simply water and wine) taken; and as the waitresses/host/cashier urged us to order all dinner items too, we did that in a rush. The drink orders did not come in a timely manner, many ingredients were missing from the bar, and we had to remind the waitress of what we ordered. It took about 35-40 minutes for the dinner entrees to arrive, which were tasty, but again, wrong.  An order of brown rice suddenly turned into an order of white rice, and the seafood portions were pathetic for the price. Bottom line: not coming back here again. Don't waste your $$$.",

Red Curry: Love it. I would order again.  Pad Thai: Was very sweet. It's normally peanut buttery at other restaurants. In either case, whether sweet or peanut buttery, I'm not a fan of Pad Thai in general. I would NOT order again because of my personal taste preference.  Opportunity for improvement: Portions are smaller than other places. Could increase the size by 10%.",

The food was absolutely delicious, with offerings besides those normally on a Thai restaurant menu, the atmosphere was pleasant and welcoming, and our server was charming, informative, and efficient. In addition to our delicious entrees (Pineapple Fried Rice with shrimp and Panang Curry with shrimp, both prepared perfectly), we ordered the corn fritter appetizer, which was delicious and not like anything we've eaten before, and fried bananas with coconut ice cream (\"FBI\") for dessert. Yum!! We highly recommend Thailicious and we'll be back on a regular basis. We're definitely bringing any out of town guests here to share the joy!",

The beef pad see ew was delicious, in spite of its mildness. The meat was tender and tasty; the vegetables were cooked right and flavorful. We had to request additional red pepper powder to increase its spiciness.   The red curry with chicken had a rich and tasty broth. The pieces of chicken were moist, tender & tasty. So were the vegetables.   We will return to this restaurant to try other dishes, when we are in the neighborhood.",

We ordered three dishes: Heavenly ginger, Basil fried rice and Drunken Noodles. We repeated our order to the waitress (not the one with the eyeglasses), but we still got the traditional Thai fried rice...I asked for the Basil fried rice not the traditional one and the waitress got angry and kept saying it's our fault to place the wrong order(we were getting really serious argument). What's going on here?  She relentlessly took the wrong dish away and asked the chief to add some basil to the wrong dish to make it as \"basil fried rice\"... I must say it tasted so terrible...not the Thailicious style we used to love...  We were unlucky today I must say. Can the restaurant manager do something to deal with the waitress? Otherwise we will never visit this place again!",

It's a great price, house wine is $5 and we always get a portion big enough to take home. good enough to continue to come back.  The pad see ew and drunken noodles were flavorful but could have some more veggies and meat. The basil fried rice was really tasty (medium spicy is perfect if you like a little spice) but i thought the rice was a little hard for my preference.  The atmosphere is good, there's two tvs with your basic sports game on and a bar with 7 bar stools. it's never too crowded when we're here. Not that fancy, similar to your average thai place.  The ONE weird thing: the music choice is all slow emotional throwbacks from the 90's. Journey, Edwin McCain, nickelback, celine dion, goo goo dolls, etc. Don't get me wrong, i knew every song but just not an upbeat sound track and nothing from this century.",

My husband and I decided to dine-in this time and get a feel for the overall experience of the restaurant. The decor was modern and trendy it felt very upscale. The music was at the perfect volume to add ambiance without drowning out the voice of the person across from you. I ordered Pad Woon Sen, the presentation was beautiful and the meal was delicious. My husband ordered the Pad Thai and loved it. The staff was welcoming and attentive and  the service was excellent. It's my new favorite Thai restaurant.",

We usually get our Thai food from Thai basil, but had heard good things and read the reviews on thailicious so we figured it was time to try it out. We ordered the tom kha soup, drunken noodles, basil fried rice, and spice of life. All of them were great and def must tries!  I've been eating Thai food and trying different restaurants since I was a kid. My parents were always looking for new places to try. They had tried thailicious a while back and said it was good but a little too greasy for them. I've got to disagree, it wasn't greasy at all, and the flavors exceeded our expectations. Now we like Thai basil, but I think we're going to make thailicious our new Thai food place from now on. Can't wait to try more items!",

    "text": "Oh the Flavors!!! I am absolutely in love with this place from just one visit.  How my boyfriend didn't enjoy his pad thai is beyond me.  I loved my sisters tofu pad thai i felt like it had so much more of like a sauce on it compared to most placed being all dry and gross.  Not this place unless the chicken is that much different.  I cannot wait to go back and get more of their pad thai.  From the looks of the pictures the panang is pretty soupy looking. So that i am definitely steering clear of because according to my best friend we like when it is cooked incorrectly like at thai ramas where its more of a thick curry that coats your rice rather than drowns it if that makes any sense.  My mom had ordered a seafood curry dish of some sort that tasted amazing as well. So this is definitely the best thai food spot for pad thai and certain dishes cant wait to try more off the menu!",

The place wasn't really crowded for a Friday evening and we had some time before our movie to grab some dinner.  The service is relatively slow considering the number of people dining. We ordered Thai iced tea to drink which took a little longer than usual. The server took sometime before they asked us about the order.   The drunken noodle I ordered was specifically with just tofu and peppers. I had asked for Thai hot.   When the noodles were served it wasn't Thai hot, lacked flavor nor were the instructions followed as seen in the pic it came along with eggs! I am a vegetarian so I pointed it out and the servers response to it was unexpectedly rude - she said that vegetarians do eat egg and if you didn't want you should have mentioned.I personally found it odd as I don't think it's True.  They freshly prepared with no eggs but I wasn't too happy with the way they spoke.",

But it wasn't uncomfortable.   The staff were friendly and helpful. They have a small salad bar that is included with a lunch purchase. It's actually just lettuce and dressing. There's also what I believe to be some Thai form of hot-n-sour soup. It was tasty. On the menu, it says the salad bar is included with your lunch, but is $6.99 without a lunch purchase. It only makes sense to pay 1 or 2 more bucks to get an entree and salad. Paying for just the salad bar is not worth it at all.   The food was very good. The red curry had some great spice to it and was very creamy. The rice was nice and sweet, and it mixed very well with the curry. It was such a good deal for lunch. Great portion, great price.

    "text": "Prologue: The weekly review by my fiancee of recommendations for local dining yielded this restaurant. It was very close to home and it had been a little while since we had visited a Thai restaurant so we decided to give it a try on out Saturday evening dinner date.  The Plot: All of the starters on the menu looked very appetizing and we began by sharing two, including the Thailicious Dumplings (which were very similar to Chinese Shumai) and the Fried Calamari with Spicy Mayo Sauce (by now you know I cannot pass up an opportunity to order this starter).  Those were followed by sharing two entrees, including something familiar to all fans of Thai cuisine, which was the Pad See Ew (sauteed wide rice noodles, vegetables, and egg that we ordered with mixed seafood), as well as something new for us, which was the Duck Curry (a crispy whole leg with red curry, vegetables, pineapple, and lychees). Both entrees were ordered mild, which was spicy enough for us.  The meal was concluded by sharing the customary Sticky Rice with Mango (which is also served with custard when mangoes are out of season).  The Scene: The restaurant was very clean, tidy, nicely appointed, and did have cozy feel to it. The music playing was much nicer than elevator music (I think it was Mumford & Sons) and the volume was comfortable (having a decent sound system does make a difference) \"Chinese Food Tour of Yunnan with Mark Wiens\" was on the TV (an appropriate choice in our opinion).  The chef's talent was apparent from the moment the starters arrived at our table as the presentation for all of the dishes was certainly above par among the Thai restaurants we've visited thus far (see Billie Z's photographic evidence below).  The quality of the food was also excellent, beginning with the Thailicious Dumplings. As many fans of Dim Sum will know, this type of dish can vary quite a bit as far as how well it is prepared. In this this case we were impressed with how evenly the filling was cooked all the way through, while being tender on the top with no pink in the middle. The dumplings were also just warm enough, moist but not wet or watery, and the wrappers were also cooked perfectly all the way around.The seasoning and dipping sauce were also very yummy.  The Fried Calamari appetizer was also right on par with the best I've tasted in my extensive experience. The breading was crunchy but not overly fried, the calamari rings were tender and easy to cut with a fork, and the spicy may was the perfect accompaniment.  The Pad See Ew was an excellent example of what we in this country understand to be classic Thai cuisine. The noodles were perfectly cooked, the sweet and spicy flavors were spot on, and there was plenty of fresh tasting mixed seafood.  We were both delighted when the Duck Curry arrived at our table as we discovered that it included not only slices of duck meat but also a whole leg. The skin was crispy and fatty just the way it should be and the meat was flavorful, moist, tender, and not at all chewy. The flavors vegetables and fruit were also well balanced with the red curry and it all tasted very yummy layered over the steamed rice.  The Sticky Rice with Mango was a lovely conclusion to the meal, especially since the chef didn't skimp on the portions of rice and mango so that it was enough for us to share.  The Rest of the Story: The service was prompt, courteous, and our orders arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Upscale Thai food of this quality is usually going to be a little more expensive than the average dinner out and, in this case, it was well worth it.  Epilogue: Everything was very good; there were no weak links to be found anywhere in this meal and we happily award four stars.  Photo Design By: Billie Z.",

The crispy Thai roll wasn't cooked so I had to cook it in the oven when I got home. Still didn't like it and the sauce was watery and salty.   The Drunken Noodle was ordered medium spice but they made it very hot. I like spicy but too much spice ruins the meal. It was made with Napa cabbage, barely a hint of a tomato, very few thin slices of bell pepper, one green bean and no basil leaves which is an essential ingredient for this dish. Guess they decided to skimp.   The bean thread soup came with overcooked, inedible dry chicken, bean thread noodles that were in a clump, scallions and tofu in a clear broth that was loaded with salt-- so much so that I woke up with my entire face (including under my eyes where I normally have hallows) swollen and puffy. That's when you know the cook used a bottle of salt. Horrible.   It saddens me that the restaurant has changed and has gone downhill. They used to make fresh squeezed lemonade but now they serve disgusting fountain lemonade. Disappointing experience.",

I use to get tired of it though but anyways since moving out here I really been wanting to try Thai food because now I miss that home cooked Thai food. I was out in the area and this place came up, I'm glad i came it was beautiful and the waitress are so nice. Had conversation with them. Food was so good because I cleaned out my plate . Definitely a place to come back too",

They also close at 3pm after lunch and then open again at 5pm for dinner time. But I definitely recommend coming to this Thai restaurant!",

Generally the lunch times are pretty busy be it a weekday or a friday. We were seated immediately though. The salad and soup bar is good. The peanut dressing they serve with the salad is really nice and I am not much of a taker of that soup.   Their specials masamann curry and panaag curry are too good. I have had multiple times and the taste hasn't changed. I have always ordered a level 4 of spice and it has been perfect for me. The pad thai is good too but I prefer the curry better. For the dessert coconut icecream is too good, its not overpoweringly sweet but is light and tasty.   The price you would look at is around $10-15 for one if u just stick to the main course. Try this place and you wont be disappointed.",

My son could live off their Chicken Satay lol. My favorite comfort food is the soup, their Tom Kha is great. So is the Larb Gai salad. Entree wise, I love the curries, especially the green. Eggplant Lover, Heaven Ginger and Garlic Lover are also good - bonus points for using good quality chicken. I need to try the duck!",

If there was any spice at all in my level 3 order, it would have been overpowered by the half-cup of sugar. Even after letting the sauce drip off each bite, my throat was hurting from the sweetness. For the first time in my life, I considered sending a dish back - and maybe I would have, if the waitress had ever returned to our table. (Clever evasion, waitress!) My husband's dish, while slightly less sickeningly sweet than mine, was just so-so, and both were among the pricier specialty items on the menu. I'm unsure why this place has such good reviews. Either the average person has guzzled so many gallons of high-fructose corn syrup that they can no longer taste sugar, or Thailicious is getting a lot of bonus stars for the cute decor.",

But my wife and I proceeded in and found a messy salad bar with spilled lettuce, etc. all over the place (floor included)  Then ordered the red curry and went to the salad bar for the included soup and salad.  The salad tongs were laying in the greens (disgusting) and the container for the only dressing available was empty.  So i decided to skip the unsanitary salad and just have soup, but there were neither soup spoons available nor bowls.  The staff whizzed around avoiding eye contact as if to communicate a \"who cares\" attitude.  Then my wife's food came to the table but not mine.  When she had eaten about half of hers, our server came to the table to refill our iced teas, but did not even notice that I had not been served.  When I asked where my food was, she went to the kitchen and returned with a bowl of warm (not hot) curry and said NOTHING as she stuck it in front of me.  I ordered my food Thai hot, and it was barely spicy at all.    IMO his place is a bona fide unsanitary dump.  STAY AWAY, if you know anything at all about Thai food or restaurant sanitation.",

Food was excellent and while it was spicy it still had great flavors. Was not too spicy where all I was tasting was spice and I could enjoy what I was eating. I did not dine in, but when I went to pick up the place looked very nice inside. I will definitely be going back for that drunken noodle and to try more dishes.",

The booth we sat at had this weird denny's diner florescent light right over the table, and they were playing terrible jaz music. Def not going back here.",

Honestly, it's the most upscale and hip feeling Thai restaurant I have been to Phoenix. Service was great, as we were one of very few people since it had just opened a few hours earlier. The waitress was really sweet, knowledgeable, and helpful. My soup was phenomenal and the yellow curry was good. I hope this restaurant draws big crowds. I would love to have another mom and pop restaurant succeed. And it would be cool to have a popular hangout right next door to my house. There's a bar in the back that seems to be coming soon.",

The only two items I felt could've used some improvement were the Thai tea and the deep-fried rolls. The filler on the rolls was kind of mushy rather then that distinct texture the  silver noodles should be. Nonetheless better than a lot of places in the area.",

I ordered the yellow curry with chicken, fried rice, and the crab rolls.  Crab rolls came with a mayo sauce, which was unusual but kinda tasty.  The potatoes in the curry were underdone, so I picked them out.  The curry itself was pretty good, but thin, sparse on carrots, chicken average.  I will give this place another try, but only one more.  I was also disappointed to see the 10% off coupon for first orders on my mobile app (where I'm writing from), but I was not given the offer on my desktop (where I ordered from) and - although they clearly knew it was a Yelp-driven order, I was not given the offer when I checked out.  Again, forgiven - will give it another try one day.  My initial review - average, but paid the price of something superior.",

One server for the 9 or so tables that were there is just not enough.  Never got asked if we needed anything else or another drink.  Maybe they were short staffed so I'm not holding it against them.

But as I shouldn't judge a book by its cover, nor should I judge Americanized exotic food vendors by their innovative company names. That's correct, we found it through Yelp and their excellent reviews and I am doing mine to reaffirm this delicious Thai place to stay put. Five stars it definitely is.   I had something called like \"Rama\" Curry (could been called something else, I am going by memory here people) with Chicken and it was out-effin-standing. I gobbled up the whole thing even if I was full way before the last bite was eaten. Coconut milk, with curry with just amount of heat. This has become my new staple when it comes to Thai food. It might not been the best I have had, but in Arizona this will definitely keep my cravings at bay very nicely. I had a taste of the peanutty special dish they have, and it was good.. but not my choice and very peanutty. Almost too peanutty.   Next time I want to try another curry though, even if the want I had was just want I usually crave. Aaaah, these first world problems!!! If you are thinking Thai food tonight, this is the way to go. Its not authentic - its just right.",

So that was disappointing. The highlight for that night was the Thailicious Dumplings! That was flavored well and it was delightful to have.

But, I quickly cheered up on my first spoonful once I got back home. It was an amazing cream like texture, and very flavorful. It was a perfect balance of spice with a hint of sweetness from the coconut milk. I am excited to try the other curry flavors and other dishes. I will be going back with my husband to dine in.",

    "text": "After a disappointing experience at Yupha's a few weeks ago, I had to go back to the drawing board and find a new place to satisfy my not-creepy-at-all Thai cravings.  Heh heh heh.  What?  Now my requirements weren't strict, it just needed to be within a reasonable distance from work, have delicious looking non-professional pictures of food, some unique sounding specialties, AND kickass dessert.  Thailicious - you are the answer to my prayers.  And though the food quality and taste hovered around \"good not great\" territory, I almost want to give you 4 stars just for not sucking as much as Yupha's.  1. The thai iced tea is excellent here and the chicken satay was near perfect - so far off to a GREAT start.  2. Lunch special was pretty good - I had the Thai pepper steak and the sauce made me think that's what I should place as my drink order next time! Drunken noodle is also recommended even though there's no alcohol in it, so maybe they just mean that it's drunk in FLAVOR.  3. I wanted one of their specialties, so at the suggestion of the server I went with the Sleeping Beauty.  Here is a description: Sauteed shrimps with bean thread noodle, ginger and celery in homemade sauce, served in clay pot.  Unfortunately it's one of those things that sounds really good on paper but just fails to impress in its actual execution.

I have experienced disappointment repeatedly in AZ to the point of apathy, but was pleasantly surprised when I came across this restaurant. A pearl in the small sea of mediocre asian restaurants in AZ.    Notable dishes we ordered were the shrimp cakes as appetizers, pad thai and pineapple fried rice for entrees, and sticky rice with mango for dessert. Dessert was delicious! Of all the sticky rice w/ mangos I have had this beats the rest, the only disappointment was the portion size, a little overpriced. Those are the must try dishes! I definitely will stop by again even if its a bit far for me, so worth it when you are craving good Thai food!",

Portions are always generous and service has improved a lot. Have tried their drunken noodles , pad prik khing and Masaman curry with tofu. Food is on the spicier side so order a mild and ask for the spice rack to adjust spice level accordingly.",

My wife ordered the Pad Thai which while cooked properly, the sauce tasted too much like watered down ketchup.   One thing they did well was the soup, it was actually delicious (I had two servings). I also finished up my meal with a Thai Iced Tea which was not the traditional type (they had whipped cream and a cherry). While it was sweet (VERY SWEET), for $2.99 I felt kind of ripped off with the amount of tea I actually got.  Will have to continue my search for a Thai fix elsewhere.",

The portion was a pretty good size I would have to say that it seemed a little bit smaller than Thai Basil. Nonetheless, the pad thai tasted delicious.    The Service I went a little after 12pm and it wasn't too busy, but the waitresses were not too responsive or just forgetful. I would try to ask them for straws or water  but it took them forever to get that to us after several reminders. Also, they did not tell us that the soup and salad was actually a sidebar; I figured that out myself as I left the restaurant.  Overall, their service was not great.   The Ambiance The design of the restaurant was really modern like a casual cafe. I thought it was a nice place to hangout with friends, go on a food date, or a family meal.",

They decreased the size of the Red Curry dish by about half and yet are charging the same price they always have. When I asked the waitress about it she advised that they broke the bowls they used to use and couldn't find them anymore so now they have these ones. Which are square single serving bowls rather than the normal large bowls most restaurants serve dishes in. If you're going to serve half the portion you need to decrease the price. Very disappointed not sure I will go back now when there are other thai restaurants nearby that offer larger portion for the same price.",

The staff here is exceptional. In all the times I have come here for lunch I have never once had bad service or bad food. I can't speak for how authentic the food is since I have never been to Thailand. My Thai food experience is limited to restaurants here in the states, but I haven't found any better than here. It has the added bonus of being extremely close to my house and 95% of the time the food is served way faster than you would think possible. If they are super slammed for lunch then it can take a bit of time occasionally, but they have soup and salad while you wait.  I am a huge fan of noodle dishes and they have my favorite Drunken Noodles and Pad See Ew.  TRY: - Drunken Noodles - Pad See Ew - Fried Thai Ice Cream",

Some examples are Holy Basil,garlic lover, or red curry.(many more to choose from) There are tables and booths.
