Location: The restaurant front shines like a new penny in the dingy and dilapidated surrounding, complete with alcoholic wanderers.  Despite the shady surroundings and the empty interior, we went in. No one was at the counter and it was hot as hell inside. Once we finally ordered, he an Empire Steak, I a Reuben and an order of Big Tex fries to share they tell me they are out of marble rye for the Reuben, wow. So I get it with the French baguette.   They don't have fountain drinks,  despite a fountain machine behind the counter, so we get 2 cans of Pepsi at $1 each.   We sit down, sweating to death as we wait for our meal. She brings out the fries, and my husband has one, I stick my fork in and she comes to grab our plate and states, \"this isn't your order\". Apparently,  it belonged to a person waiting for a to go order. Jesus.   The fries were ok,  the sandwhiches were ok,  nothing to rave about.  Certainly nothing to sweat to death for.",

It's next to a liquor store and right in front of a bus stop in a parking lot overrun by feral teenagers. On my way in, I was accosted by panhandlers and nearly mowed over by drunken scooter operators zipping up and down the sidewalk (who looked all of 14 and were all swigging alcohol out of black plastic bags). I might Door Dash a sandwich, but I will never park my car here again. I was too afraid I'd come out and have my hubcaps stolen (Do feral teenagers still do that??) or find my tires deflated.",

The positives are that there seem to be some nice people running the place, but there are some downsides they need to work on.  1) The menu board goes blank every five minutes. 2) I ordered a sandwich that had bacon on it. After waiting almost 15 minutes (and it wasn't busy in there), they tell me that they are out of bacon. I was willing to just go with my huge, expensive order of pizza fries, but instead of refunding me they insist on giving me a different sandwich. I say ok, but I really would have rather had just the fries.  In the end, the sandwiches are huge but I don't really like the bread.  I paid about $15 and ended up eating less than half of everything and threw the rest away as it is not something you can eat as leftovers.  3) I was not a fan of the area. Right near a liquor store in a questionable part of town. I was very uncomfortable coming/going as they were some people just hanging out in front of the liquor store looking like trouble.  I personally won't go back, but I think once they are in business longer they might be a good place for those 'in the area'",

We found this place on my iPhone food maps so we thought we would give it a try. The owner was behind the counter and greeted us when we went in. Aziz was very personable and had us laughing. He suggested some food and we took his recommendations. The sandwiches were good but the BBQ Texas fries were amazing!  We can't wait to go back and try some other items on his menu. It was close to our clinic and he said to call ahead and order so all we had to do was pick up. Which is very convenient when you are on a schedule. Thank you Aziz for the special attention that you give to your menu items. We will be back!  I would highly recommend this place if you want a good sandwich with real ingredients.",

I was imagining that it would be melted and gooey and just nice and warm but it was pretty cold the cheese was pretty hard so it was not gooey to dip your fries in but the fries were lacking taste.  I also kind of found it  disappointing that they don't have fountain drinks it's more like a canned soda that kind of sucks because I would rather keep refilling if it's heavy food like subs and fries",

Third, the menu is not particularly East Coast although they do have pastrami and corned beef. They also offer a take on shaved beef that approximates pot roast. Now the positives. The food is pretty darn good. I had the fish sandwich and my wife ate a combo of the really spicy hot links and that shaved beef. The only part of either dish that didn't measure up was the French fries; blah. Oh, those late appearing onion rings. Next time I'll pass; too greasy, but decent flavor.",

To be honest, i would have liked the flavor no matter bc of the name, but I got invaded and it was awesome.

I went with the cheese, cheese that was so highly recommended.Normally I would never get anything like this and it had mustard on a meat sandwich. Wow, that is usually a big no no in Ny and for Mary. However, the sandwich was delicious.   The place is small, the menu is limited and they do not have a bathroom but the food is good. If I lived close by I would be in there a lot.",

    "text": "I went here earlier today for the first time. I asked the girl at the register if they had any burgers. I had been sick with the flu and haven't been able to eat any real food lately... And really had a taste for a burger. A burger. She named off three things that were most closest to a Burger which were the pizza burger, the Cowboy and the chopped cheese, I really had my mouth set for a burger so I ordered the chopped cheese and just added Mayo thinking I would be getting myself a nice hamburger. Anyway I get home and find out it's sort of like a sub sandwich and the meat is actually chopped up. I know it says chopped cheese but I had no idea would actually be chopped up in minced pieces. It tasted okay, not really cup of tea... so I gave it away and went to Wendy's instead . You guys should really make your cashier's are familiar with what's on the menu and to also listen to the customers and what they're asking for. That would really help out a lot for first -timers! I will be returning but I will be sure to bring my glasses so that I can read the menu clearly and make sure to get what I want, LOL. The fries were delicious!",

We ordered The Cowboy hot sandwich & the Corner Beef Reuben hot sandwich, BG (butter garlic) fries & fried pickles. Quick service & food was fresh & hot, especially the fries - we hate cold fries! Sandwiches were really good so were fries & pickles. Lot of food. Only negatives was Reuben bread fell apart & it was a little warm in there (but they had just opened) other than that it was worth the stop. Will do it again.",

I'm not a big fan of sandwiches full of corned beef or pastrami, so I was glad to see my companions scarf down a Reuben and a Rachel so I could get the feedback. They were apparently fabulous, the Boar's Head meats really shining. The rye bread looked good and I did have a bite of sauerkraut, which had knockout flavor and texture. We shared a side of garlic butter fries and all three of us together couldn't finish it.  My meal was cheese steak fries and they were as savory and intense as the best chili cheese fries when you're really in the mood for something like that. I couldn't quite finish that, either, which is rare for me.  We were musing about different ways to order the sandwiches next time (e.g., swap the Reuben sauerkraut for some Rachel slaw) and Aziz overheard us and offered to make it over, even though it had been perfectly prepared. We declined and kept eating like sled dogs.  The inside decor is almost nonexistent, so it feels like a utilitarian kind of place, but most of the diners stayed rather than getting carryout, and the atmosphere was chill and cozy.  The air conditioning leaves something to be desired. But I did find that once I was sitting down eating, I didn't really think about it.",

You'd think it would be easy. I can buy bread, meat, dressing, lettuce, tomato and onion at the store - why can't I just do this at home? Don't do this, by the way. I already tried it. I mean, it's not like it was HORRIBLE - but there's something you just can't quite get right. And I'm pretty sure it's the bread. So much so, as a matter of fact, that I asked them if they make their own. They confirmed that they do, and even gave me some to take home for asking! Super nice outfit, fantastic sandwiches.

Everything was AMAZING. Lots of flavor and plenty of food. You definitely get your money's worth. Great service as well.",

At first I was a bit turned off at the price of $9 for a sandwich, but then I ate it and couldn't finish it all in one sitting so I saved the rest for a pre gym snack and after getting essentially two meals out of it I was happier with my purchase. The taste was delicious, it was super refreshing, the toppings went all the way to the end of the bread (Most sub places think we want a bite with just bread at the end of our sandwiches, or they are lazy)! In all, I live right by here and I am happy I do because I will definitely be returning!",

The food arrived hot and fresh and tasted amazing. I originally thought $9 was very expensive for an order of french fries but these things were amazing and piled high with toppings. Two of us could not finish them. I love their food and plan to visit the actual location in the future.",

My Pastrami sandwich was supurb, Im a pastrami guy and I have only tasted 1 better, and that was Little Miss, Better here because there isn't a hour wait. Attention to details start with the great pickles, and paper lined platters.  The dining room is tidy and organized, subway tiles, brick walls and high definition menu boards are a sign the owner is taking care of business.  Skip the rest and try the best, its worth the extra buck.",

Next time we will share one sandwich.  The ingredients were fresh and not prepackaged, prebreaded, etc. The bun was fresh and just the right texture. The onion rings had a good taste. And the staff was very friendly.  Our tab for two sandwiches, onion rings and two canned drinks came to $25.50, plus a few dollars in the tip jar.",

We took a brief look at the menus before choosing a bbq beef sandwich & the Baja chick sandwich. Heads up there is NO restroom, after the long drive from Cali I was quite frustrated with this also. After the long trip and finally checking in we dig in. The Baja chick is gross, the sauce is too much and overkill's the food. You are paying for bell peppers and sauce. There was barely any chicken on the sandwich, it was a sauce and bell pepper onion mix on a hard French baguette. Never again! I had a bite of his bbq beef sandwich and it was really good, that one I would definitely recommend to try. A waste of money but hey it's the life of a foodie.",

Occasionally we find an authentic spot and I get a glimpse into what his normal food adventures used to be. When we found Outta Bronx and saw that it was rated nearly 5 stars we were really pumped to try it out.   We ordered a hot chick sandwich, a small macaroni salad and the cowboy sandwich to go. We decided to keep our orders simple, because we were expecting some massive NY style sandwiches and didn't want to overdo it. What we received was mediocre at best. The hot chick was alright, but the chicken had a fishy taste. I'm assuming that is due to using the same frying oil for their shrimp. The cowboy tasted more like a Philly cheesesteak with BBQ sauce and some bacon. I didn't end up getting the macaroni salad, but rather they gave me a potato salad which was good... nothing too spectacular and not what I ordered. All in all, we didn't get the authentic NY style sandwiches we were anticipating.   Maybe we went in with our expectations set too high, but either way we were left with something to be desired. In short the sandwiches were alright, but nothing to write home about. Honestly, the sandwiches were something I could see Subway, Quiznos or Togos putting out. The prices were a little high for what we received and I don't foresee us going out of our way again to return anytime soon.",

Will give this place another try, but wasn't terribly impressed.   Went a few weeks after it opened, and they were clearly still working on the details. No soda fountain, and the drinks they had in a cooler were room temp. Cooler won't ever really work in this joint - too busy. Ordering took a while, lid behind the counter was alone and being asked to handle too much at once. Couldn't find any ketchup for fries. Or napkins. Eventually got the latter, not the former.   Food prep was quick - a plus.   Food was ok, not great. I expect these types of sandwiches to be heavy, but mine was totally overloaded w mayo - flavor drowning amounts. The meat seemed to be good quality, just got slathered to death.",

Since we've found this place we've been back twice in one week  but it's that good!!!  The sizes are great as they aren't too small to where you aren't full. Depending on the sand which you can have leftovers!  They also have wings (very yummy) & a great shrimp basket- the shrimp are fried to perfection.  We are definitely repeat customers.",

Then their chopped cheese which they promoted as one of their best sandwiches was soggy bread from the tomatoes and again no flavor or season to the sandwich.  A little salt could have been the start.  Not even having a soda fountain machine?  Very disappointed in this place!!  I'm an East Coast native who ate many a delicious meal in the Bronx and other suburbs... I hope this place gets its act together and figures out their food recipes or they won't last... Phoenix does not need another bland wannabe but seriously falls short NY Style by name aline eatery!  I will be back at least once as I hope the food was a fluke one time major faux pas!!",

It was a week before grand opening so finishing touches were still being added to the place but they had already been open for business for a few days. On that first visit I ordered the shrimp basket - six big, plump nicely battered and well seasoned shrimp on a bed of fries; it was a delicious, filling lunch. On the second visit I got the chopped cheese, the most modestly priced of their hot sandwiches and an iconic New York comestible (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F11%2F08%2Fnyregion%2Fchopped-cheese-sandwich-harlem.html%3F_r%3D0&s=8382ac25566f31c8fe79d777f35cc1f59c11099c76949f16bdae4124c2594e95\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nytimes.com/2016/11/08/n...</a>). It features ground Angus beef with melted American and provolone cheeses with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles; great combination of ingredients, so scrumptious I finished the whole thing even though I had intended to bring half of it home for later snacking. The onion rings I ordered on the side were so good I skipped the ketchup I normally have with onion rings.The place is simple and cozy, the crew is very friendly, and prices are very good.",

I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be little  \"Joey\"  like from the show  \"Friends\" when it comes to my sandwiches.   Today, we went to \"Outta Bronx\" for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the crew at \"Outta Bronx\" are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; \"Outta Bronx\" is here to stay.  It was hard to decide what entrees to choose after viewing the menu, everything smelled and looked delicious. After a few minutes our decision was made, we went with the \"Sonoran Dog\" and the \"Hot Shroomy Swiss Sandwich \" and both were delicious.   The Shroomy Swiss Sandwich at \"Outta Bronx\" is  the perfect brisket sandwich, loaded with thin slices of cooked-to-order brisket, sauteed garlic herb mushrooms, melted swiss cheese, fresh tomatoes and lettuce all on a lightly toasted French Baguette Roll. This sandwich might be big enough for two, but I decided to eat the whole sandwich after my very first bite. I was so full after eating my sandwich I didn't have any room to try my friends Sonoran dog. However, my  lunch companion said her \"Sonoran Dog\" was the best she's ever had.  The staff at \"Outta Bronx\" are very accomdating, friendly, and personable.  I will definitely be back in the near future for the food and music that brings me back to growing up in the Bronx.",

    "text": "Instead of going to one of our usual spots for lunch today, we decided to try something new. I came across this place in one of the Yelp emails about hot & new places. I checked out some pictures and decided I needed to try this place.   I was a little weary of trying this place for one reason: my boyfriend. He's from Philly and always criticizes all of the sandwiches/hoagies here in Arizona. I was definitely worried he would be upset that we drove almost 30 minutes for a sandwich.   We drove past it on the way there. It's located in a small strip mall next to a Water N' Ice store. There aren't many parking spots so once people realize how much of a gem of a place this is, that may be an issue. Apparently, they opened only 2 and a half weeks ago. I can tell you right now that we wish there was a location closer to us. (If you decide to open up another one, maybe Old Town Scottsdale or North Scottsdale please!)   I ordered the Chopped Cheese and Brian got the Empire Steak (I may have the name wrong for his). We also got fried pickles and French fries. We didn't care for the fries... there was nothing special about them - if they would like some feedback, we would recommend a thicker cut French fry. Maybe it was our fault for ordering a plain order of fries instead of one of the crafty ones on the menu.   The sandwiches were cut in half so we were able to share and try each other's. Mine was the winner! Brian and I both enjoyed it very much and would definitely get the Chopped Cheese again. He enjoyed his Empire sandwich but liked mine more. The bread that is used seems fresh and perfect. Ahhh, I'm dreaming about it already. Good bread for sandwiches is hard to come by on the West Coast.   The fried pickles - get them and get a side of ranch. They are perfectly crisp and flavored. I am picky when it comes to fried pickles and only like pickle slices not wedges. Definitely would order these pickles again!  Looking forward to coming here again - even if it means a 30 minute drive (without traffic). Hopefully we will see another location nearby in the future. Best of luck and can't wait to try some other sandwiches soon!",

The pizza fries were pretty good but the Big Tex fries were amazing.  The entire time we ate the owner kept checking back to see how we were doing, and he was a great guy to talk to.  But again ... the food was AMAZING!!!    I told him I'd be back to try more as it's a good day trip up on my motorcycle and my wife punched me for suggesting I'd go without her.",

    "text": "Outta Bronx just opened two weeks ago and it's already one of my favourite places in the valley! It's almost an hour round-trip for me from home, but when you have a craving... it's worth the drive (luckily they are much closer to my office). Bringing their unique sandwich recipes straight from New York, this place is the epitome of local greazy-spoon take out. This isn't some generic \"not-from-Philly Philly cheesesteak\" place, this is a unique and very NY take on classic street-style sandwiches and heroes/subs.  Customer service: top notch, which is obvious since they just opened and make an effort to connect with the neighbourhood and their customers. Definitely has a family-vibe to the staff, giving the impression that a family just moved their entire local Bronx restaurant to Phoenix, as is. They have also been doing a great job on social media trying to connect - I already know that one of the main guys (owner probably) is Aziz and he loves to interact with the customers. Aziz may have no clue who I am, but when a place just opens and you already know some of the names - that shows how they are putting themselves out there for the guests.   Location: located in a strip-mall at 40th & McDowell, with bright red paint outside - not the best neighbourhood so just be aware of your surroundings when parking and walking around outside. There are about 6-7 tables for dining-in, so if it's gets busy (and it does during peak hours) it can be hard to find a place to sit; be prepared to make it a take-out order. The interior is nice and very clean, with minimal decor. As of March 1st, they still haven't had a soda fountain installed - it's that new!   Food: the most important part by far...  The menu is pretty simply, but has lots of options:  signature hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, wings, and a whole section dedicated to french fries - but not sides, these are entree servings. They have a bunch of different french fry recipes that involve meats and toppings and tons of gooey melted cheese. It's a big order, I could not finish one on my own and that says a lot. The sandwiches are mostly made on french baguette hero rolls, and they are really excellent. The meats and toppings are fresh & ample, and overflow from the heavy-duty size they serve.   I have been twice now and each time got their famous signature Bronx item: the chopped cheese. I'm hooked! I never knew these existed, but apparently its a really popular item in the Bronx and Harlem - like NY's version of the Chicago hot dog or the Philly cheesesteak. And it lives up to its reputation - it's amazing. You'll just have to try it for yourself. But be prepared: be hungry and don't be on a diet lol.  So the first time I went, I had the chopped cheese and didn't have to think twice about going back. The 2nd time was last night and I got the same thing again, and also got a Hot Beef for my wife. It's described as \"thin sliced\" but I guess thin is a relative term - the beef was pretty thick, and it was tasty (of course I had to have a bite to try it), my wife really liked it. We also wanted a side, and I decided to ask for just cheese fries. Served in an entree dish, they baked a mix of cheeses over the crispy fries - it wasn't just a cheese sauce poured over it, it was actual baked melted cheese. Very yummy and satisfying! These people know how to make the food that perfectly comforts me.   I will definitely be frequenting this place as much as my budget and diet allows; I kind of want to try every item on their menu - they all sound so good! But it's going to be hard to not want a chopped cheese every time.... I think I have found my new favourite sandwich joint. Outta Bronx is badass and totally unique to Arizona. I wish they had a location in North Scottsdale - they would kill it there.  I look forward to Outta Bronx being a new tradition in the valley. They have the perfect combination of comfort NY food and great family hospitality. Totally feels like a local Bronx joint and looks like they could be a staple for Phoenicians. Can't wait to go back!",

I ordered a three items for take out to share with a couple of friends for lunch and overall pleased.  I don't see how one person could eat any one of the items I ordered alone. The one thing you can say about this place is that they don't short change on the portions. The first item I ordered was the Shrimp Basket and I was very impressed with the size of the Shrimp and the fact that there is no tails on them. The second item I ordered was the NY Dog and it was really good overall. I was not a fan of the crushed tomato. There was an overwhelming amount of onions but just pulled them off. I was fascinated with the cuts they have on the hot dog. Something I have never seen before. The third item I ordered was loaded fries that had tons of stuff on it.   PROS: 1. Food was fresh and tasted great 2. Place was very clean 3. Staff was really nice and welcoming 4. A lot of food for the money  CONS: 1. No tartar sauce or ketchup provided with Shrimp Basket 2. The hot dog bun was really soggy at the bottom. Two of us ate it with knife and fork. No way to pick it up and eat.  Overall, really nice place and will continue going back.",

I was talking to the owner while waiting for my order when he told me that their bread is made on premises. At first I thought he might be just blowing smoke, but when I started eating the sandwich, it was clear that the bread was super fresh and full of flavor. Like it was freshly baked. I was very impressed! One tip, the portions of fries are huge!!",

I also ordered 2 different types of wings and they were crispy and moist inside, with lots of flavors we got Asian and garlic parm..... we only waited 6 minutes for it all.... only one complaint.... no ranch for my wings lol but it's okay it was all worth it...",

The chop cheese was like a cheeseburger crafted into a heavenly sandwich. All of the meat was thinly sliced and there was no awkward pulling-the-whole-piece-of-salami-out-all-at-once issue. The customer service was fantastic, to top it all off. I had asked for water and I was offered a free bottled water since there was no soda machine. This customer service and amazing food makes for a great place to stop and eat! My only suggestion would be to extend the evening hours for those late night munchie cravings!",

Outta Bronx will satisfy that craving for a  Philly Cheese Steak, Italian Beef or Reuben or Chicken Parm with meat piled high and cheese and sauce oozing out of the sides and down your forearms!!! Mountains of French Fries drenched in cheese and chili like you only see at a state fair! THE BEST place to go if you have the munchies! I can't believe someone here wrote a review with the word \"ambience\" in it. LOL! The place itself is like a spartan pizzeria with about 10 tables but CLEAN. Very depressed neighborhood and not the most upscale clientele, but seems to be safe (No one bothered my car). As noted elsewhere, the owner is very sweet, proud of his shop and will do his best to please you. If you understand there is authenticity and joy in some greasy foods, this is the ultimate expression of that guilty pleasure!",

    "text": "After hearing about a new little sandwich joint that had just opened up, I jumped into Outta Bronx yesterday after work. Wasn't thinking ahead when I subjected myself to weekday 4:30pm traffic to 40th and McDowell from Uptown/Central Phoenix but by the time I thought about it, I was already en route. So very glad I trudged on...  Walking in, there isn't much that jumps out at you but give it time. They're still green. I have a feeling that we are going to see many more of these pop up as word gets out. But I'll get to that in a minute. Either way, there were maybe 5 or 6 small tables inside so you can eat there if you like and the ambiance was good enough to allow for it. Think of a small gyro shop or take-out place. Kinda like that.  The service from the kid behind the counter was exemplary. You could tell he was proud of the product and a fan, too. He made some solid recommendations on his favorites and had a smile the whole time. I ordered the Chopped Cheese sandwich and my buddy got the Shrimp Po' Boy. We also split some of the Baja Fries. Price was very reasonable. Around $7.50 for my sandwich and a can of soda for a buck.   While we were waiting for our food, I saw some of the other menu items being prepared and served. The Chili Fries looked awesome and their hot dogs are freakin' HUGE!  We got the food relatively quickly (as quick as you would expect anywhere else) and took it back to my place to chow it down. My sandwich was 100% exactly what I was looking for when I ordered it. Beefy, cheesy, gooey yumness and the bread was good quality, too. I tried one of the shrimp from the Po' Boy and will DEFINITELY be ordering that very soon. There were 8 very large fried shrimp and the sauce was perfect.  The Baja Fries came in a large to-go container and the thing was filled with 'em. Fries with cheese, jalapeno's, chicken, peppers, onions, covered in a spicy aioli sauce... so good. But don't expect to knock down a sandwich and a large order of their street fries on your own. NO, this isn't me challenging you, it's just a suggestion! Hell, I could do it if I wanted to... and if I didn't want to accomplish anything for the rest of my day... Hahaha  If you're ever in the area (or even if you're not) and you want a good, comfort-food style sandwich, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT.  There isn't another menu in town like it and the quality of the food will bring you back for more.",

    "text": "So my family and I stayed at a hotel in Tempe and we are from out of town. When it came to deciding where to eat I used Yelp and just found something nearby and with good reviews. This place had excellent reviews and was 5 minutes away. The location isn't bad, it's not a full size restaurant which is great for on the go or lunch. And parking was easy. When we arrived the place was clean, the guys at the front were friendly and understood it was our first time there. So I asked what was good and recommendations and they told me the Empire Steak I believe it was called. They were both very knowledgable about the ingredients and customer inputs which made the decision easier. What I liked the most is everything was made fresh and on the spot. When the food was ready they brought it to our table and let me tell you, presentation is everything and the food was making our mouths water once on our table. In no way did anything look small, in fact we ordered a thing of fries thinking we would need it and ended up being stuffed by the end! By the time we all finished we were pleased and happy and the gentleman came and grabbed our plates to throw away for us. I will highly recommend this place and come again when in town! Thank you guys!",

I called in last night to place an order for wings again. When the lady answered the phone she just said, \"Hello.\" She didn't introduce herself as Outta Bronx. Next I proceed to order all flat buffalo wings, and I asked her about a different flavor, and I specifically stated all flats, half buffalo and half asian invasion. When I received my order, it didn't have all flats. I called and advised the same lady I placed my order with, and she stated, \"You didn't ask for all flats and they charge extra for all flats!\" I was never charged a fee for flats. So she argued back and forth and was just locked on her word, basically saying I was wrong. So she said, thank you and hung up. Very rude and not apologetic. I decided to not do business with Outta Bronx. If someone doesn't care about their customers, I can only imagine that they don't care about my money and the food I purchase to keep food in her mouth.",

However, the two sides of ranch dressing were not delivered. It's kinda hard for me to eat pickles with no ranch dressing and wings without ranch (or blue cheese dressing). So I knocked off a star. I must say the cook on the wings was perfect (crispy), and they were freshly prepared (still hot when I got them). I would have liked the wings to have more sauce bc I could barely taste the Asian sauce on them. The pickles were also good, but really salty. I probably would have been able to escape some of the salt with the ranch dressing I ordered (hint, hint, that's why I asked for it).   If I return to the area I may try a sandwich option and some fries. Please note, I will ask for ranch dressing just because I feel it is owed to me.Lol!",

Parking is limited just as a heads up and it's in a very assuming part of town. Walking in there's about 10-12 seats total but the place is super clean with nice decor.   I ordered the Empire Steak and my friend ordered the Long Island, we also had the pizza fries. The Empire Steak is essentially a philly, it's very very good. The best part is the baguette, that's amazing baguette. My friend enjoyed his sandwich as well. The pizza fries are crazy good, they taste like cheesy garlic bread + plus pizza.  I can't wait to try other other things on the menu, this is a very good spot.",

Bread was crusty and warm and added to the wonderful meat selection. The pickle chips were the best part of the meal too! So good and the best I ever had. We also ordered fries which we weren't able to finish. He was kind enough to make them pizza fries for us so that they would reheat better and taste better when we got home. He then gave us a piece of coffee cake that he has flown in from New York every week. Absolute divine!  Everyone that came in got friendly conversation and great food!

Outta Bronx has been tucked away on the south side of McDowell Road at 41st Street for the last four months or so. And we found it after a Google search and the strength of its Yelp! reviews.  I'm glad we found Outta Bronx because it's very close to work, the place is super clean, the guys who own and run this sandwich shop are really friendly, and the food is really generous and delicious! 'Nuff said.  But I'll digress. Our cashier recommended their most popular sandwich, the Empire State Sandwich, their take on a Philly cheesesteak. It's huge. It's really good. And it's worth every penny. But this isn't just a sandwich shop. There are specialty hot dogs, salads, several variety of topped and loaded fries, and more.  There are so many options on the menu, it's gonna be hard to resist coming back to try more. And with the happy faces behind the counter and manning the grill, it will be damn near impossible. Thanks!",

Lots of meat and cheese in, a hot link, and even French fries inside the sandwich.  At 9.50 I thought it was a bit high but after seeing the sandwich, I would understand why.  I also ordered a $4 side of fries which was a waste.  Very barely fried (pale) and the seasoning that was supposed to be on it was barely there.  I kicked myself for ordering them.  If the sandwiches already come with fries inside, why the extra fries?  But those are my sons, always wanting extra stuff when momma is paying.    The place was spit-shine clean (pardon the Bronx words) with classic white subway tiles.  The guy taking my order was friendly and gave me a cup of ice water on a hot day.    The neighborhood is a little rough especially with the large liquor store a few doors down.  When I came out, two men were near my car and when I approached, they asked me where my battery was located (it is a foreign car).  I asked them why they needed to know that.  They claimed that there was a woman in the liquor store who had the same car but didn't know where her battery was located.  (Yeah, right).  I quickly scooted out of there with my two delicious sandwiches and mediocre french fries.",

I recommend the Empire State or the Fatstack. I came here for a music festival in Phoenix and I ended up coming here 3 times. Wasn't let down once. The food is a big portion too. Half the time I had to take the other half of the sandwich back to our Air BnB. Their fries were good to and their variety of cold subs, salads, hot subs, and fries makes this place a great place for lunch. Hope they stay in buisness so I can come back in the future.",

Everything we've had was exceptionally tasty and portion sizes are good.

For the cilantro haters: The cilantro lime salad was incredible and I hate cilantro!! I'm one of those weird people that think it tastes like glue, but I try to never substitute sauces because I trust the chef's creations. The lime inside the sauce definitely cut into that taste I have a hard time with and it was so enjoyable. The salad was fresh and had great toppings. Highly recommend!  The Cali Chick sandwich was good but it didn't blow me away. I resorted to smothering it in that amazing cilantro lime dressing I had on the side.   The Parmesan wings unfortunately didn't impress me due to being a bit dry and the ranch on the side wasn't homemade. I wish I tried the Asian sauce.   Overall, I am impressed with this place and would order from them again. If you're staying in a hotel, order here instead of room service.   Enjoy!",

It's a small shop located in the small plaza off of McDowell next to a liquor store but once you walk thru the front doors, the ambiance shifts and takes you back to NYC.  The place isn't super big but that's OK as you can smell the variety of different food being cooked for orders to go and for people who are sitting down.   I went with the fat stack sandwich which included French fries sausage, chopped beef and a few other things along with a nice aioli sauce on top.

We only tried the wings but they were perfectly cooked and well flavored. The two guys working there were pleasant and efficient.   It's a small place fewer than 16 seats I think. But they do a brisk take out business as well. Parking is also tight, I imagine lunchtime might be very difficult to park. We were there in the evening and it was not too busy at that time.   I'm looking forward to returning and trying some other items from the menu.",

I'm definately going back because there was a bunch more stuff that I wanted to try and it's close to work.",

After much deliberation, I got the Hot Chick and hubby had the Pizza Burger; both were HUGE and delicious. The chicken was tender and crispy not terribly spicy but good heat. Burger was tender and flavorful. Both were served on a perfectly soft, crusty French baguette with fresh produce. We also got the fries which were sprinkled generously with paprika (and maybe a tad too much salt) but hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Overall, VERY good and we'll def be back to try some of the other fab choices.",

    "text": "We were searching through Yelp for something new and found Outta Bronx. The place is cute in sketchy old strip mall,  pretty hot inside the small dining room.   We picked two sandwiches the cowboy and the big fish,  12 garlic parmesan wings, onion rings, small order of fries and two diet Pepsi's total was 45.00.   The cowboy turned out to be a burger on a French baguette, it was really good I took half of his sandwich and he took half of mine. It had barbecue sauce fried onion, and some sauteed jalapenos and lettuce and tomato it was pretty darn good. The big fish was two pieces of fried fish, lettuce tomato and some sort of a mayo based sauce on a French baguette. It's was good as well. My husband and I agree that the wings were our favorites they were dry wings with a parmesan garlic sauce I would definitely go back and order mostly wings. I will want to try out the hot chick which I heard numerous people order after reading the ingredients sounds very good. I will also take a picture of the menu and attach it for your review. The only thing I would suggest to the owner is to relocate to a bigger place with with a bigger dining room and an AC unit that will cool the place down not to mention parking it was very tight and it was a lot of people trying to get it out of the plaza. The two employees working a lady and a gentleman in the kitchen were working so hard and they got slammed with orders and people coming in please get an extra employee to assist  them. I'm sure there could have been some extra orders that would have been taken care of if you had an extra set of hands. I suggest anyone to try these delicious wings and any of their sandwiches I'm sure are delicious.",

So this place was a total shot in the dark when I was meeting a friend for lunch in between our places of work.  The fried pickles lured me in, and man, did they not disappoint.  They were light and crispy -- not oily and batter stuck perfectly.  And I know my fired pickles!  I had the Hot Chick sandwich with fried jalapenos and it was so delicious.  The chicken breast was tender and again - not greasy at all.  I told the owner his fryer must be the perfect temperature.  I was tempted to get a salad because they too looked good, but I couldn't resist the French baguette with the sandwich.  All this, and the owner (I am assuming) was the nicest.  I will probably stop by here every time I find myself in the area.",

For a little extra I got on order of the Baja Fries which is grilled chicken, melted jalapenos, jack cheese, grilled bell peppers, onions, and jalapenos with spicy aioli over crispy fries.  Both entrees were amazing.  The pictures do not do this food justice, the taste is much better that the look.  Which to me is the most important thing anyway.  Although this place is a 30 minute drive from where I live I would definitely make the trip just to eat there.  This place did not disappoint, great food at a reasonable price.",

The fries taste like the oil was a little old. But the worst part of this was the service. My co worker and I ordered at 11:02am and didn't get our order until 11:35. People who came in after us received their order before us. Mind you my co worker got only 6 wings. Seems like they only had one person cooking at a lunch time which is concerning. Then they try to give my food to someone else because they didn't know who it belonged to. We had to end up taking it to go as it took 30 minutes to receive a cheesesteak sandwich 3 wings and an order of fries. Really enjoyed the taste of the meal besides the fries but will be hard to go back since it takes entirely too long to get our food. Oh and my co worker enjoyed her 6 wings. FYI prices are a little steep.",

It's located in a busy, small strip mall with very limited parking. The guy that took our order was friendly and helpful. My boyfriend ordered the Hot Beef and I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy and a basket of the garlic Parmesan fries. Its a small restaurant with two cooks on the grill, so our order of two sandwiches and fries took a little over 30 minutes. But it was worth the wait! The Shrimp Po' Boy was the best Shrimp sandwich I've ever had! My boyfriend also loved his Hot Beef. The fries were ok. I didn't care for the garlic oil because it completely soaked the fries, making them soggy; not crispy. However, we came back the next day and ordered the same sandwiches with their regular fries and they were perfection! We will definitely be back!",
