    "text": "LOVE this place! Been there for lunch/dinner maybe 20 times, and have had ONE below average visit. The service borders on amazing. Somehow they are at your table constantly taking care of you WITHOUT being disruptive. It's very tricky!  The food is good, and the portions are generous. The one time we had an issue was simply because the tea came to us cold, and our waitress was having a seriously hard time explaining a dish to us, and taking our order (language issue). But every other time we dined there, it was amazing! The prices are so low for such quality/quantity/service, it will keep you coming back for more. I only wish they had some more variety insofar as vegetarian dishes go....Their menu could be from the '70's. Try it for lunch, the specials are a bargain.",

    "text": "On our first night in Phoenix, after flying in from Savannah, we opted to stay in, relax, unwind, and get caught up with daughter/step daughter, son-in-law/step son-in-law and granddaughter, Izabel. We had not seen each another in over a year. Take out Chinese seemed like the perfect way to fill our bellies with a minimum amount of effort or interruption of our family social objectives. Upon consulting Yelp reviewers and looking at the map, we easily settled on Golden Gate. We were not looking for gourmet or exotic, just good old fashioned take out.   If it isn't already obvious however, we were hungry. Our order included egg rolls, crab angels, fried dumplings, kun po shrimp, Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken, moo shu pork and both white and brown rice. Every choice was well received although the crab angels, dumplings and Mongolian beef received the highest marks. One person thought the moo shu was too runny and would have benefited from more pork. Another commented that the chicken could have had more veggies while a third remarked that they liked the way the chicken and its sauce were packaged separately, thus preventing the fried meat from getting soggy. All in all, this was a very satisfying meal, with tons of leftovers, and all for just $56.60.   An excellent way to enjoy the first evening of our long weekend in Phoenix.",

We all dined by candlelight and I really enjoyed it.  lol  We had Sizzling Rice Soup, Egg Drop Soup, Dumplings, Mongolian Beef,  Sichuan (aka: Szechwan) Shrimp, and Crispy Duck with some VERY good white rice cooked perfectly... finished off with some fried banana. hao chi !!

We ordered  a Happy Platter (which made us very happy), chicken chop suey,  beef chop suey,  sweet and sour pork and garlic chicken.  The portions were so big, we ended up sharing among 4 people and still had leftovers. The chop sueys was quite tasty! The egg rolls and chicken wings in the happy platter were on point! (I definitely want to go back for the wings!) additionally, they were able to accommodate due to food allergies. The waitresses were very efficient and friendly. In fact,  when they found out it was my dad's birthday,  they came out with a cupcake and sang Happy Birthday.

Is it the best in the world? No. But it sure is darned close! I've never had a bad meal here. Their complimentary hot tea and crispy won tons with sweet & sour are always the perfect appetizer. Add some hot mustard for spice ;-)  The staff are always courteous and make sure you are well taken care of as soon as you walk in the door. Tsing-Tao? YES PLEASE!  I have a little secret for you - Order their Garlic Beef. This is the only restaurant in the valley (that I know of) that actually sells it! It is PHENOMENAL!  Tangy, saucy, garlicy beef that melts in your mouth. Your entrees come with a container of steamed rice that add just the right touch of Asian flair.  Don't listen to the haters out there, this is a really great place for old school Chinese food. If you aren't in the mood for the trendy overpriced nonsense of \"other\" restaurants, go visit Golden Gate! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!  Oh, at the end of it all? Crispy fried won tons with a banana center and powered sugar! YAY!!  Get out there and check out Golden Gate!",

Golden Gate has a beautiful decor.  The owner Sue is so elegant and charming.  She's been in business for 24 years and very proud of that fact.  Can you blame her?  The options are plentiful.  This place is really a \"have it your way\" establishment.  You can substitute tofu instead of meat for virtually any dish and can substitute veggie fried rice instead of white for 50 cents.  A little pricey, but the food is fresh and they give plenty of it.   I have enough for leftovers.  I was able to add broccoli to my meal and they actually know how to fry tofu correctly!

    "text": "The place is old but clearly has maintained an enduring spirit of excellence,  especially based on the history behind some of these reviews.   First time here. It's a cold day so I was going to order hot tea, only to be surprised with a complimentary pot brought out along with water! Yeah baby. My hubz liked the free chips too, but I saved my room for the good stuff :)  So then we ordered 2 cups of hot and sour soup which was fantastic. Really warms you from the inside, and it had a nice after-kick (without kicking your ass). Also got the fried wontons- they weren't served with cream cheese filling so as a personal preference I might skip next time. However,  if you like a little chicken or beef filling, these have your name on 'em!  We shared the chicken curry. Loved the layers of spices and flavors in there, and the sauce was generously portioned, too. Chicken, bell peppers, onions, peas and carrots came along as the accompaniment to the sauce and the whole combo together was a win.  Our waters were never empty. We're both camels so that's impressive.  All these reviews that whine how outdated or dirty this place is are completely off. The decor strikes me as more vintage than \"dated\", and I didn't see anything that indicated this place is not kept clean. Haters gonna hate.  But I loved it!  PS- also, a great value for your buck here. Prices were great",

    "text": "Hadn't been here in years and much has not changed. I like the fact the the booths and tables are spread out over several rooms (keeps the noise down) and that your meal comes with tea (piping hot in its own little metal pot). I was seated immediately for lunch at 11:30am and my order was taken promptly. You get a steaming bowl of either egg drop soup or sweet and sour soup with your meal. I got the egg drop. It was good, but not the best I have ever had. The meals also come with an spring roll (very good) and 2 small fried won tons (mainly won ton wrappers with so little filling I could not figure out what the filling was supposed to be) and a fortune cookie.  For my entree I chose the Lemon Chicken ($6.75). This includes a large bowl of fresh fried rice and enough lemon chicken for 2 meals. I needed a to-go box and have plenty left over for supper. The dish has large pieces of chicken breast, battered and fried with a lemon sauce poured over it. If you get some of the sauce it tastes very strong of lemon. If you get a piece without the sauce then it just tastes like fried chick. I wondered if a little lemon zest in the chicken batter would amp up the lemon flavor in the chicken itself?  Service is terrific. The restaurant is very clean (but I was baffled with the white butcher paper on top of the table cloth). Parking is close to the door. Oh, and I loved the aquarium in the dining area (it was very clean, with lively gold-colored fish).",

Awesome egg drop soup, and the egg rolls were fresh and crunchy.  The chicken & shrimp lunch entree was nothing special, but it came with a small pot of fried rice, which is another nice touch.

First, they seat you, bring tea and  chips (sauce for the chips are already at your table when you are seated). My mom and I love their fried dumplings and crab puffs. Add red chili sauce. Delicious!! Try this restaurant, you won't be disappointed. My favorite dish is the garlic chicken with their amazing sauce and fried rice! Their fried rice is top notch! The food is absolutely delicious! Best Chinese food in Arizona!  The owner of the restaurant is very nice and welcoming! We have known her for years. They place white butcher paper on top of the table cloth because of spills and to protect the table cloth.   The decorating of the restaurant does need to be updated, however, it still has its charm. Booths are pretty low for those who are in the tall club. Nevertheless, my family and I enjoy the food.",

Very recently I called them with a sizeable order late one evening, only 20 minutes before they were set to close. They assured me that it was no problem at all.  When I ran up to their door they were there waiting for me, order in hand, and greeted me by name!  I have tried several of the dishes and I have found them all to be delightful. I frequently order take out and it never takes more than 15 minutes to be ready and is always fresh and hot.  Eating in is equally enjoyable, the service is prompt, they serve complimentary tea, and at the end of the meal they serve a complimentary pastry filled with banana and dusted with powdered sugar.   I've enjoyed the lunch specials on numerous occasions and they are awesome.  The egg rolls here are the best I've had in a long time!  Even at lunch the portions are very large, but are super cheap!  The lunch specials even extend to Saturdays!  Recommended dishes: Garlic Chicken, Golden Gate Special Beef, Mushu Pork, Pork Fried Rice",

I decided to get that again and was disappointed to find a small plate of soggy fried beef in a watery sauce with a few plain walnuts.  My dining companion had the garlic chicken and it was a little slimy.  The crab angels tasted fishy and the pot stickers were more wrapper than filling, so everything was a disappointment.  It definitely isn't as good and it's far more expensive than I remember it.  Too bad.",

I loved the shrimp as well, although it was a darker sauce rather than the white sauce I expected for shrimp. Sadly, the chicken fried rice wasn't up to par - gristle on the chicken and dried-out peas and carrots (I wish restaurants wouldn't resort to this shortcut with fried rice; a little fresh onion and bean sprouts would be much better). I'll go back for lunch on my own, but chicken fried rice is my husband's go-to order, so a place won't wind up in our regular rotation unless they nail it. Bummer, because the rest was great!",

    "text": "So if you looked up \"Chinese Restaurant\" in your Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, the picture that would pop up along with the description would probably be this place. Standard Chinese place with all of the usual suspects that your grandma would expect from such a place. Heck even Vogons would have loved this place if it weren't for that stupid hyperspace express route. But back to the restaurant - looks like kind of Chinese restaurant my parents would have taken to me back when it wasn't one of many choices but THE Chinese restaurant in that part of town where everybody in that area went to get their Chinese fix. Back when asking someone if they preferred Hunan to Szechwan would get you a response like \"what'd you call me?\" So my usual dining companions decided on this place when we tried to go to Beavers Choice but they were closed for lunch due to some odd circumstances. Place is in a mall right near the 101 and has plenty of parking. We entered and were seated right away. Looked like the lunch specials were the thing to go with so we each got our own lunch combo. I got the sweet and sour pork and it came with an eggroll and egg flower soup and also some white rice. Meal was decent and filling - the type I would expect from a place like this. The layout is a little weird - we were seated in a raised area. If you want to get up to use the restroom, you have to cross tiny walkways which also act like delivery express lanes with servers carrying plates back and forth so it ends up being like a game of Frogger - you gotta cross quickly and at the right time. Good times. Price - it was very cheap for what you get - like the prices got stuck in another decade - so my coworkers want to come back here again. Myself, not as enthused as I felt there wasn't anything really that special about the place or the food. Of course, my coworkers were also entertained by our neighbors at the next table whose conversation overpowered ours. Several old gals who talked about past husbands sparing little detail - what little we heard was enough to make my coworkers want to introduce themselves so they could hear more at a future date. I had to drag them away back to work. Would come back if in the area and out of other options and if my coworkers really start working on their script for Fifty Shades Of Grey-haired Bastards.",

For dinner they bring out fresh fried wontons and for dessert you get fried banana wontons and fortune cookies. Brings back childhood memories :) We always order the golden gate fish which is fried pieces of fish in a sweet sauce with toasted walnuts. It's very good, better than the shrimp version. The szechuan chicken is really good too. If you like it spicy make sure you specify that when you order. I always need chilli oil on the side. But the food is very good, I keep going back.  Service can be slow, so if you get a hold of the waitress tell her everything you want at once, cuz you don't know when she will be back :P But the staff is very friendly.",

Not sure what \"pretty standard\" Chinese food means; but compared to several other east valley Asian fares, including the major chains, this place is superior.  Plus, if you're going to gamble on taking out Moo Shu, the dish that is typically created and rolled at your table, well, you takes your chances.

    "text": "It's great to walk into a restaurant recommended by Yelpers and get the feeling that it is going to be a good meal.  Traditional chinese decor without being gaudy.  Quickly treated to free tea and  served crispy, fresh, non-greasy noodles.  How attentive!  Even the table has the traditional condiments right on it (soy sauce, real-hot mustard, duck sauce).  Nowadays you have to ask for these as restaurants are cutting down, and the mustard is not the great strong Chinese mustard--it is a watered down type.  Ordered soups: egg drop which had bits of chicken in it and wonton.  The egg drop was very good and the broth of the wonton soup was delicious--the wontons lacked meat inside or at least one of the wonton did not have meat but for $2.25 each I cannot complain about a thing!  Ordered Schezehan chicken,chicken fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce.  I wanted to try the shrimp with lobster sauce after the fiasco I experienced at Qwik Chinese Bistro in Scottsdale.  You can read the details in that review.  This one did not let me down.  12 large shrimp in a nice, non-sweet sauce with water chestnuts.  Lovely and delicious.  Made me forget about the prior fiasco.  The chicken fried rice was a large, delicious plate of a multi-ingredient rice. Wow, and they added bean sprouts which i think really makes it even better.  The Schezuhan chicken was made without breading and spicy just as he ordered it.  What a great meal this was.  With our check came the typical fortune cookies AND as a bonus, wontons filled with mashed bananas with powered sugar.  These were better than you might expect.  Such a simple treat and yet so delicious.  They didn't have to do this but they did.  The service was spot-on without being overbearing.  I had to bag up the shrimp and lobster sauce that's how large the portion was. BTW, pricing is very reasonable and the service was impeccable.   Thanks to all at GOLDEN GATE who made this delicious meal possible!",

Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I have had a lot of Chinese food of all qualities and types.  This stuff was pretty mediocre, middle of the road stuff.  The place really does have the look of a 1970s Chinese joint as has been said by other reviewers.  They also have that little mini grill lit by sterno that they put on the table so you can cook meat on a stick (or burn it if you are not careful).  They don't have that back home. . .  Sure, I'd eat there again some time, but this place can't compete even with the average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.  You will get a plate of quite edible food here for your dollar, will get good, attentive service, and will leave full--just don't expect anything special in terms of taste.",

It has weathered the storms and continues to be my favorite Chinese American eatery in the area. So many items are amazing, but my all-time favorite is their Mongolian Beef, which I picked up yesterday and inhaled. It's amazing. If you're low on iron, order it. Seriously. And their egg drop and hot 'n sour soup are also nice.   The current service is extremely fast, which can be good and bad. If you're going in a group, I recommend sitting at a table rather than the booths. Meals seem to go at a better pace there. Ordering takeaway is also super fast and efficient.  It's a bit tight in terms of wheelchairs/powerchairs, but doable and worth the visit.",

When you first walk in there is a lot of red colors and dim lighting, it is a great place to bring your loved ones.  Immediatly your eyes will go to the giant fish tank to the left of the walk way which is always fun.  When we first got seated we were served hot tea and wontons with sweet and sour sauce, I had the orange chicken and it came with an egg roll and soup of your choice, I chose the hot and sour soup.  I thought that it was all delicious, but my favorite was the hot and sour soup, it tasted alittle vinegary but I really liked the crunchy bamboo shoots.  The service was great the owner was walking around talking to all of the customers making sure that all of our food tasted good.  Another great thing about the service is that the food got to us super fast.  I would definetly recommend this place to all of my friends and family!",

A relocation to Idaho has made me even more aware as to just how much I miss this place. Nothing in Idaho compares. However on recent visits back to the valley and Golden Gate I have noticed some changes that warrant 2 stars rather than 5. Things are just not what they used to be. Where is Sue? Golden Gate, affectionately known as \"GG\" to many regular customers, was lovingly referred to as \"Sue's\" in my family. Sue, the gracious owner, was just about always there to greet you with a smile and make you feel welcome. She made a point of visiting with her customers, treating them like family. Her customers became her friends. Many of life's milestones were celebrated there at Golden Gate with Sue. On my last visit to the valley I had a chance run in with Sue. All of the changes that long time customers are so aware of make more sense after our visit. Sue has sold Golden Gate and is transitioning into retirement. The restaurant has been her passion, her life, for 30 plus years. She spoke of how much she misses her friends, the business, and also of how flattered and honored she was to have such loving and loyal customers. I'm certain that her faithful customers and friends  join me in wishing Sue every happiness as she embarks on this next chapter of her life.",

My honey had the Mongolian beef and oooooh weeeeee it was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.

The amount of food I received go $13.95 was overwhelming. A huge bowl of fried rice came with the entree and the service was perfect.

I live about 6 miles away from GG and it is definitely not on my way to downtown Mesa--so it meant going out of my way to get there.  I've eaten here many times by myself when I am out running errands. I walked in today and stood at the entrance, and I stood and stood. A hostess was not present and a busgirl(?) passed by me twice without looking my way or acknowledging me. She was going around with a pitcher of water. I can understand that she might not know English, but she should at least know how to say hello or \"Someone will be with you in a moment.\"   She didn't go to back to get someone or acknowledge me. I just felt invisible. Diners were looking at me just standing by the hostess counter for quite a while.   Finally, someone came out from the back carrying soup and an eggroll for a table. As she passed me, on her way to a table, she asked, \"Takeout?\" I said no and waited for her to come back. She then asked again, \"Takeout or eat in?\" I said eat in and she led to me table.   I don't know why, but the whole experience put me in a bad mood. I was just turned off to being there. I guess I was viewing it as a treat to have a leisurely lunch before running errands. I placed my order, and the soup and egg roll were delivered, but I just sat there. I finally just got up and left.   This was around 2 pm. Usually Sue is there and I am greeted immediately by either Sue or someone else. But I felt ignored and put upon today. I felt like I was imposing on them rather than feeling welcomed.   I will go back, and will just think of this as bad timing--passed the lunch rush and served by someone I had never seen there before. This woman definitely did not make me feel welcomed.",

    "text": "Apparently this place has been here for 30+ years. I can see why, I really can.  Tonight is my second visit here. It's time for me to review. Golden Gate is definitely a step up from anywhere around here. The staff is extremely friendly. They go around and talk to the guests. I say guests and not customers because they really make you feel welcome. The decor is a bit out dated. But I've seen other restaurants close to here that look even older. They keep this place clean and uncluttered. Unlike other older places that tend to have piles of junk in corners and stuff on shelves... We've all seen places like those. This is NOT that type of establishment. They obviously take pride in their business. The menu is far better than others as well. My first visit I had the double cooked pork. Which was on my scale 8.5/10 only because I was expecting breaded pork but theirs is not. Still it was very good.  The second visit I had the Golden Gate spicy shrimp. MAN! It was GOOD! 10/10 for sure! Their hot and sour soup is excellent too! They bring you complimentary hot tea and won ton chips as you sit down. Nice touch.  They play nice soothing music, quietly so you can hear your own conversations. I can't believe it took me so long to come here. This place is TOP NOTCH. Srsly.  If I would change anything it would be this, they charge $4 for noodles if you want to replace it for the rice. (as a Diabetic the less rice you eat the better, noodles aren't that much better but every little bit helps) they should offer the noodles as a substitute for a lower price than $4.   Other than that, this place is awesome!",

They serve hot Oolong tea with your water which is really nice. The food is basic but good. I've tried the Mooshu pork and the Sesame chicken. Both what you'd expect. My fav tho, is the Singing Rice soup. A pork and shrimp soup with a very light broth. It sings when the dehydrated fried rice hits the hot broth, it snap-crackle-pops like your rice crispys! Fun And tastey. You may need some soy tho, as it is a Very light broth. Otherwise good service, good food",

Owners certainly could invest in the outdated decor and a good scrubbing wouldn't hurt either.  Very busy for 2pm on a Sunday afternoon.  So business is good!    The quality of the meats are very good and the flavors were very good.  The cashew shrimp was very bland.  The garlic chicken was good,  not spicy. Portion sizes were mediocre for the prices.  Came with white rice,  would have liked a choice of brown or fried.     Service was excellent.  I was very thirsty and my water glass was never left empty for long considering how busy they were.

My bf ordered some kind of chicken, that was fried and served with a clear sauce.  It was o.k.  I ordered a scallop dish, and honestly, the sauce just smelled like something that was spoiled.  It was not edible.  I am Asian, I have consumed all sorts of things, so it was not the smell of the seafood, or anything like that.  I have eaten Chinese in Hawaii, Japan and California.  I do not consider myself a chinese food snob, as I have been known to eat at Panda Express on occasion.  I really wanted to like this place, but I couldn't.  Even the eggrolls were bad.I cannot comment on the service, as we had take-out.   Sorry,  Golden Gate....",

Their hot sour soup is the standard by which I judge all other Chinese places.  At lunch I've rarely had to wait for a seat but the place is almost always at least half full -- just right.  The owner is friendly and so are the servers; many of them have been there the whole time I've been going.

The service is perfect, never having to wait long for a refill, and also make sure you try the mustard. It will make the hairs in your nose stand up.

The service is always great & the food is really good(not as salty & overpriced as others in the area). Super cheap, especially at lunch! My bf & I are used to NY chinese & Arizona doesn't usually come close. The ambiance & authenticity here are just what you get in NY. Unlike the other strip mall types around the Tempe/Mesa area, this is tucked away with a lot of regulars inside(mainly older folks), but the restaurant is a real set up with very sweet decorations(not saying completely tasteful, but very sweet). The only thing that ever surprised us was mushrooms in one of our orders & it wan't on the menu. Other than that, they're nearly always on point & super nice. We prefer the beef & brocolli or the mongolian beef, but we're moving our way through the rest of the menu. We love it!   :)",

The place was clean and the service was good.  The table top had a stack of about 4 sheets of commercial paper for easy clean up.  The seats were covered in a plastic sheathe.   The food was thoroughly unremarkable.  We started with the crab puffs and teriyaki chicken skewers.  The crab puffs appeared to have a decent amount of crab, but the wanton casing appeared old and stale.  It wasn't served with any type of dipping sauce.  The teriyaki chicken skewer appeared to be deep-fried chicken tenders with absolutely no teriyaki sauce or flavor besides a soy sauce marinade.  They were left unfinished.  The entrees looked like 100% frozen meats and sauces.  They were absolutely artificial and flavorless.  Simply heated to a warm temperature and served on \"Golden Gate\" etched faux-china.  The place really needs to catch up about 30 years.",

This was a good choice and much better than we expected.  We ordered the egg drop soup.  It was hot, not luke warm, had good flavor and bits of chicken.  The dumpling order was 8 large pcs, with plenty of meat and the skin was thick and hearty!  Very good and the sauce was just spicy enough, too!.  The first dish was the Mongolian Beef.  It was well marinated and very tasty with sauteed green and white onions.  We also had the chicken with plum sauce.  I wanted mild today and the server suggested this.  I was hesitate at first because it said it had bamboo shoots.  Sometimes they are added as filler to make the dish look like more food.  This was not the case as there was almost no bamboo and no waterchestnuts!  The veggies were green peppers, onions, pea pods and mushrooms.  And there was plenty of chicken too!  We were not able to finish and took the rest home in an ice chect!  Definitely one Chinese Restaurant to try if you're in Mesa, Az!",

My personal favorites are the golden gate special beef , the moo shu ( with tableside service...i mean come on who else does that, and the crab angels. The crab angels are to die for, they are so fat and plump here unlike all the other places grease filled triangles. these are little golden purses of crab so good who needs a sauce ( i mean who eats them with sauce anyways... if you need sauce for your crab angels they must be horrible .) if you call yourself a chinese food fan this is a must try!!!!",

    "text": "Based off other yelp reviews I assumed this place was incredible. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this place mediocre at best.  The service was excellent, the staff was very nice and attentive. The problem was the food.  The fried wonton and egg roll were average (deep fried and difficult to ruin). The mustard and duck sauce are in ketchup and mustard bottles (a bit odd). The hot and sour spicy soup was pretty good. So far so good...  Unfortunately, I decided on the Golden Gate Beef. The meat had a rubbery consistency that is difficult to describe. Under cooked chicken would be a close description. It was unappealing and flavorless. The fried rice was pretty bland, nothing to write home about either. The walnuts were the best part of the dish. I feel like with better quality beef this dish could have been a hit. It really feel flat.  Overall, if the main dish was better I would return. Also, the surrounding businesses unfortunately give this place a ran down questionable vibe. Google maps this place and you will see what I mean. I wish them the best of luck, it just was not my kinda place.",

When I arrived home I started to taste test what I ordered which was China Expresses orange chicken, beef n broccoli, house fried rice, chow main, egg rolls, and crab puffs. Overall I enjoyed the house fried rice over everything else I ordered.  There is more sauce and vegetables than the actual dish your paying for.  The feeling of getting a tasty homemade Chinese dish is hard to come by and this place was not it. If you read this and are looking for that homemade chinese dish joint I would 110% tryout China Jade in Tempe, Arizona. The fact China Jade has a 3.5 star rating and this place has a 4.0 star rating is a disappointment & lie! Due to them being the only place I have found in Arizona, that brings out that homemade dish feel. Tasty, filling with the best of flavor. Price is well worth it also!",

    "text": "This is a love note. It's gonna be gushy. If that is gonna annoy you, the short story is: this place is amazing you should go; get the Golden Gate Special Beef, Kun Po Chicken, and you should be very happy. If you are OK to indulge me, read on.  This accurate review will be strewn with sentimental nostalgia. You have been warned. Also, for those that enjoy humorous anecdotes of sensitive lads taking themselves too seriously, I've added something at the end for ya...   The Golden Gate atmosphere is comfortably classic in its Chinese Restaurant rendering. I have never had bad service. It has always been courteous, graceful, and swift.  My love affair with Golden Gate began in 1982. I was 17. I was taken to GG by Jong Kil Kang and his wife Soon following a Tae Kwon Do tournament at MCC. We were famished. The meal was a victory lap for us. We had mopped up the competition.  We had War Wonton Soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Kun Po Chicken, Peking Chow Mein, Moo Shu Pork, GG Special Fish Filets, Szechwan Beef, Golden Gate Special Beef, House Fried Rice, and eggrolls. We even got some Kimchi. God I love Kimchi. Don't expect that now. The kimchi hookup was back in the day and this place is Chinese not Korean.  Ok, so this smorgasbord was life transforming. It was a flavorful awakening to Chinese food possibilities. It set the bar high, stratospherically high for Asian cuisine experiences to come. As I look back on all my previous visits, I cannot think of a time when service or food quality dipped below my high expectations.  Following my initial visit, this establishment soon became the family-style-dining gathering place for my friends. My friends weren't part of my TKD world, but everyone likes to eat and we were all family-close. We would save for weeks, then euphorically jump into a table for 8, lazy-Susan in the middle, gaze wide-eyed at our menu, hungrily and joyously embarking on our Chinese Food Adventure for the month. Friends do silly things, like challenging each other to eat exclusively with chopsticks or to do so left handed. It was awesome and tasty and none of us will ever forget those life-defining and life-affirming times. It was glorious. It was the Big Chill seasoned with the most amazing Chinese Food the Valley of the Sun had to offer... then or now.  To be continued, the evening of Feb 1st.",

As you get in, you're faced with this beautiful well decorated quiet ambience typical Oriental.   I didn't have much time so I was hoping they were quick on the order. The lady immediately showed me lunch specials so here's what I got:   - hot and sour soup...DELICIOUS!! For some reasons I got two of those (maybe I didn't express myself clearly); - fried rice was also good and even more tasty with some soy sauce on it (eat it hot cause it tends to dry up); - sweet and sour pork...and here's why I don't give 5 stars: it was very mushy and pretty tasteless even with additional sauce. Too bad. It's one of my favorite dishes of the Chinese cuisine.   Service was quick. I would say they probably took less than 10 minutes. I would go back, just not for the sweet and sour pork.",

Despite the appearance, they consistently cook some of the BEST Chinese food in the valley. The current owner is so sweet and friendly, and always makes it a point to walk around to tables and make sure the customers are happy with their experience. The tea is excellent and so are the egg rolls. It's also very difficult to find a restaurant that makes a good Egg Foo Young...Golden Gate's is superb! So is their Lemon Chicken, Kung Po, Moo Shoo, and pretty much everything else on the menu. There's only one other tiny problem with Golden Gate...they're located next to a sewer treatment center. Sometimes the smell on the walk just through the parking lot is unbearable. There's nothing they can do about the location, other than move, which isn't possible when you've been in the same spot for as many years as they have. Overall, Golden Gate is a Five star restaurant with one star interior design and one star one location. I hope to see them redesign in the future!",

After moving to the southwest I had to give up my two loves, real pizza and tasty Chinese...  UNTIL I DISCOVERED GOLDEN GATE CHINESE on Baseline in Mesa!  GOOD LORD! THICK egg rolls! HOT & SOUR soup with a generous amount of heat and spice. GARLIC CHICKEN THAT CAN NOT BE BEAT! And the owner, Sue, has been there for 23 years - her chef has been with her for 22 of those years. This is, far and away, the BEST CHINESE FOOD I HAVE EATEN WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.  RUN, don't walk, to GOLDEN GATE!",

Golden Gate is about as good as it gets in Phoenix. It's small and intimate, the service is fast and friendly, the food is amazing, the prices are remarkably low, and it is privately owned and operated. You can't beat it!",

    "text": "i'll admit it: i've gotten old. i hate going out on NYE. i hate dealing with the drunk masses that inevitably have popped collars and think Pabst Blue Ribbon is the bombdiggity. sure, i could solve that problem by going to a friend's place to party, but then i have to drive home and let's face it, i like to get my drink on. driving home just blows. so, we have a nye tradition (in its second year) of staying home, eating chinese food, drinking, and watching movies. it works out pretty well except for the fact that we hadn't found a great chinese food place yet.  enter Golden Gate Chinese restaurant. i had driven by this place almost every day since i moved here in December 09 and always wondered what kind of restaurant didn't have windows. i'm serious. the entire building = windowless. it looked more like a money laundering operation than it did a chinese food place. since we really had exhausted our chinese options around the area, we figured we might as well try Golden Gate for new years. hell, if it was horrible, we could always have frozen pizza.   much to our surprise, we found that Golden Gate was freaking fantastic. we ordered the crab angels (crab wontons), mushu pork, veggie friend rice, and honey walnut shrimp. this stuff was like crack! i think we demolished everything. the honey walnut shrimp was a perfect combo of sweet honey and crispy walnuts. they didnt drown the shrimpies which was much appreciated. the crab angels kicked ass. you know how when you order crab wontons at places and they give you a metric ass ton of wonton and a tiny dab of crap in the middle? not this place. they were like sacks (crunchy, tasty sacks) FILLED with crabby cream cheesy deliciousness. the veggie fried rice was perfect and the mushu pork rocked. they didnt put the plum sauce in it and left it on the side so you could add as much as you wanted.   no, they dont have delivery but the food is definitely worth the effort of take out or dine in. i might even have to try dining without windows sometime :)",

    "text": "So as I said before, this place has great garlic chicken. Delicious. I went back here last night and actually ate there (I've always gotten take out.. so this was a first). It is so worth it to eat there! They give you tea, which is good, and little fried wonton skins with red sauce... yum. So I got the wonton soup again and it was delicious just like the last times... I love their soup. Also, the BF and I decided we wanted to try their potstickers (So he has never liked potstickers, but they are my favorite part of chinese food. So I have not ordered potstickers cuz he won't share them with me... so about a month ago he decided he likes them, so now I can finally have them....yay!). Their potstickers are delicious!!!! They are all crispy on the bottom and still soft on the top and when you cut them open they have the juice on the inside, which is a sign of a good potsticker. The sauce also is good, not the best I've ever had, but very good. It is a bit spicy and has a few green onions, though more would be better. Then we had the wonderful garlic chicken. So the best part about eating in the restaurant is at the end they give you a little fried thing with powered sugar on top.... and in the middle there is banana!!!! So. Good. So go Golden Gate!",

We couldn't finish either of the chickens, and would have sent them back if we were eating sit down. The servers seemed very nice, but we can't justify going back if we can't eat the food ...",

I was a waiter in a Chinese owned and operated restaurant in college, and I lived in Asia for a year, AND, visited both China & Hong Kong, so I KNOW authentic Chinese food.  This place is the real thing.  Not to mention great friendly service, and their water is definitely not tap water...It tastes great.  I love these 'mom & pop' family-owned businesses.  You just know you are going to get great food when the place is not much to look at from the inside or the outside, which means the ONLY reason they are still in business is really good food & service!  I was surprised they were pretty busy for a Monday night, with several take-out orders.  It is hard to fine a Chinese place that is open 7 days a week, and particularly on Mondays.  If you don't like this place, you don't know REAL Chinese food, so just go back to your chain China Gate & Pei Wei crap! LOL",

I strongly prefer GG after trying each a few times.  My faves at GG are the sesame chicken, the crab angels, and the house chicken.  The beef and broccoli is a family favorite as well.

The place inside was dark and old and seemed dirty. The bathroom opens to the dining area, so that made it seem worse. Probably wont be back. Disappointing.

    "text": "We were impressed with Golden Gate.  We started with an order of Crab Angels.  $4.50 for 6.  They were plump and the filling had a much higher mixture of crab than most Chinese restaurants provide.  We shared House Fried Rice, Triple Seafood Delight and House Special Chicken.  The fried rice had chicken, beef and shrimp.  The rice alone I would give 3 stars.  The seafood delight lived up to it's name.  I'm normally not a fan of the traditional white wine sauce on this dish but Golden Gate's is very nice.  The scallops were done just right, melt in your mouth.  The crab also was tender and cooked just right with no taste of fishiness.  The shrimp was slightly overdone but still very good.  The house special chicken was a whole chicken breast dipped in a thin coating and deep fried, then sliced and placed over a small serving of vegetables.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful with a robust brown sauce.  My daughter had chosen the restaurant for her birthday dinner and they must have heard us mention it because after the meal they brought out fried dough pockets filled with banana and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.  Nice touch and very tasty.  Our total bill was about $38, a great deal for the quality and quantity of service.  An appetizer, fried rice and 2 entrees shared among 4 people and we brought home 3 boxes of leftovers.",

    "text": "Just tried this place for the first time today, after living nearby for the last 13 years and never stopping in.   I've been wanting a old-fashioned Chinese restaurant who served food family-style, but with a hubby who considers Pei Wei's Orange Peel Chicken as asian as he'll eat, I never really had the opportunity to search places out. Now that my daughter is old enough to eat at a restaurant without making a scene (you parents know what I'm talking about) I've started to venture out with her to try new places.  On the kid-friendly front, they've got a nice aquarium with some large colorful fish in them and a fountain right in the center of the restaurant. We were lucky enough to be seated right across from it. My daughter loved watching the fish while we waited.  After reading all the reviews on Yelp for this place, I decided to give it a try, and I'm SO glad I did. This place is fabulous. And their prices are very reasonable, especially for their lunch specials!  I'm on a calorie/carb restricted diet, so I'm always really careful with what I ordered. I was happily surprised to find lots of veggie/protein combos to choose from. The sauces that came on them were nice and light. I didn't feel like I was \"cheating\" by not ordering them without the sauce.   I'm SO thrilled that I've finally found my Chinese place and will be coming back regularly! (My daughter has already demanded that it becomes our regular eat-out lunch place - which we do once a week).   The service was prompt and responsive. Sue, I'm assuming, was roving around making sure all of the guests were happy. A few patrons called her by name, which is always a good sign.   We will definitely be back. I'm even planning on dragging my hubby in and making him try it. I know he'll love it once he gives the place a shot!",

Decor is a little dated, but that makes it kind of fun as well.  Portions are good sized.  Egg rolls are great, and so is the Hot and Sour soup.  My fav is the Kung Pao chicken and house fried rice.  Another thing I always look at is Maricopa County inspections.  These guys do a GREAT job of keeping kitchen clean.  Their inspections are always good.",

Incredibly kind staff, amazing food, great prices, and the best Chinese food in the valley. My personal favorite dishes are the lemon chicken, Mongolian beef, and hot and sour soup. When you go for dinner, they give you a plate of appetizers with a flame at the top so you can cook your own food, and there is a teapot with teacups on the table for lunch and dinner. After dinner, the staff brings out fried bananas with powdered sugar to your table. All of this is free!  Make sure to come here, it is an unappreciated but incredible restaurant!",

The service was wonderful and courteous. Now, when they bring out the hot tea without asking and its complimentary, that is old school and what I am used to. The crispy wonton skins was an added plus.  The waitress made up the mu shu pork with the pan cakes. They used a lot of bean sprouts which took away some of the flavor but it still was good. As for the Peking Pan Fried noodles, I guess I like the Hong Kong style of noodles better which is more crisp. It looked like they added the Chow King noodles from the can and had the sauce soften them. Again, there were a lot of bean sprouts in the dish. The crispy duck was good, but my wife thought it was a little dry. I loved it. Told her she should have ordered the Roast Duck instead.  To top it off, we were given a fortune cookie and a wonton puff  with honey inside and powdered sugar on top. Nice way to end the meal. BTW, I had enough left over to enjoy lunch the next day.",

There was 3 of us and we were there for almost 2 hours for 3 cocktails and 2 egg drop soups, potstickers and 2 entrees both with chicken. The restaurant wasn't packed either. One of the egg drop soups came out and had a black hair in it, none of us at the table have black hair. also when the lady came back we told her about the hair in the soup and she apologized, picked up the bowl of hair soup started to take one step away and sat the bowl of soup on the table in front of us (which also had guest) and i never saw her pick back up the bowl of soup which means the hair soup was served to the table in front of us. The potstickers were decent. Once out entrees arrived (almost an hour later) we started eating when we noticed the chicken wasn't quite right so we stopped eating it. We couldn't figure out if the chicken was just very poor quality, microwaved, under cooked (bcuz it was pink in some pieces) or even chicken at all. Now it's the next day and 2 of us are sick as 10 dogs. I would give 2 stars since the pot stickers were fine but currently 2 of us are camping out in the bathrooms and 1 of us had to MISS WORK! This place needs to be investigated by the Health Dept ASAP!",

The other day we finally got around to trying it.  I was not expecting genuine Chinese food, on the contrary, I was expecting old-school, Chinese-American stuff like chop-suey. In that, I was not disappointed. With a couple of exceptions, their menu could have come out of a Chinese restaurant in the Midwest circa 1970.   I was, however, disappointed with the food, sadly. This is one of those places I was anxious to like--a real throwback and a survivor. But truly, the food was not good. In fact, my egg foo young tasted a little spoiled. I threw it away and ate the friend won tons they gave us. The rest of the food, according to my family, was not that bad, but nothing great. Even the spicy dishes tasted rather bland.   I do love the look of the place, and the service was friendly and efficient. I hate to give it a two star review, but I can't muster any more than that right now.",
