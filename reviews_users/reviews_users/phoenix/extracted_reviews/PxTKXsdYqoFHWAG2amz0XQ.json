It was relatively empty, but I guess that's to be expected for 9pm on a Sunday night.   We got the arancini for an app and split two pizzas for dinner. They were excellent! I even ate the leftovers in the morning. I hate leftovers! We might even go back!   We just got wine and whisky but they were both good selections. Would definitely return.",

    "text": "Not the best experience. Our server had an attitude since we got to Nook Kitchen. He seemed annoyed to even have to talk to us.   My friends and I only wanted to have a nice night out with drinks and good food. One of our friends was visiting from Denver and knowing that he's a foodie we thought Nook Kitchen would be a great place to take him.  Sadly, the moment we got there the experience started out wrong as our server was kind of sassy.   We ordered appetizers but we never got them. My friend from out of town asked for his steak to be sliced and the answer was no because we are very busy but I'll bring you a knife... what bothered us wasn't too much the response of our server, but the tone and attitude he responded!   When we finally got our food, we asked our server what happened with the appetizers and he seemed to have no idea of what we were talking about... with that we asked for those items not to be charged to us for obvious reasons (we never got them) and again our waiter seemed annoyed by that.  The food was good but not great! The bolognese was kind of bland and the pizza was undercooked. However the steaks was amazing and the chicken masala had a lot of flavor to it.   Nowadays I believe that when you got out to eat it's not only about the food but also about the whole experience. One thing we all were expecting was for our waiter to say something about the whole bad experience... at least \"I'm sorry about the appetizers\" but nothing... we barely saw him again that other than when he brought us the check.  The good thing in our case was that the manager/owner noticed what happened to us and came to our table to apologize! He tried to make it right to us and even gave us a gift certificate to get the appetizers we never got. I do appreciate that a lot as not every manager/owner would have done that. I don't know that we'll be coming back, but if we do I just hope we get a different waiter and now I know to go for the steak instead of the pasta!",

ANd the chef made a small bowl of linguini for my 1-year old granddaughter to nibble on.  We ate at the outdoor tables while she made a huge mess, and the staff was really sweet about it. As my first visit to Phoenix, this made a good impression on me.  Enjoy!",

I started off w a glass of prosecco which comes in an individual orange small bottle which reminded me of veuve champagne. And as appetizers, we got the shrimp cocktail and the short rib bruschetta. The shrimp cocktail came w 4 jumbo tiger shrimp which was perfect for the 4 of us. The short rib bruschetta was amazing!! 4 pieces of bruschetta topped with hearty portions of short ribs. It was soooo good!! Will definitely have to come here again for this paired w wine. For my entree, I got the shrimp fra diavolo which has jumbo shrimp, linguine, white wine, red pepper, Calabrian chilies, garlic and crushed tomatoes which gave it a spicy kick. It was good but wasn't amazing... the sauce was a little bland but was decent enough to eat. Next time will definitely try the short ribs or scallops instead. My husband got the chicken Marsala and our two friends got the Nook spiced airline chicken and the cowboy ribeye. From what I could see and a little taste of everyone's dishes, everything was amazing!!! My husband's chicken Marsala was to die for!! The sauce and chicken was cooked to perfection!!! Yum!! And our server was perfect!! Will definitely come back!!!",

This place had a nice ambience and romantic window seats that allow you to look at the night's lights. So we came in and tried the caprese bruschetta which was really great but then again it's hard to go wrong with that. Now as far as the entrees, the chicken Marsala was really good! The salmon however was not worth the money, I wouldn't recommend it. It lacked the proper seasoning and taste that I expected for $30. BUT the best part was the butter cake dessert. Which is my favorite dessert I've tried at a restaurant.",

The pizza was fine but I could get the same or better for half the price at Mod Pizza.  Then we ordered the ooey gooey butter cake and it was not gooey at all. It was a small slice of what looked like cheese cake and was very dry and hard. It was not good. I love butter cake and this is not your traditional butter cake. Overall we spent $65 on our meal (two entrees and a dessert.  No drinks) and I feel like we could have spent half as much somewhere else and had a way better meal. It was very disappointing for our romantic Valentine's Day dinner.",

    "text": "My wife and I were visiting from out of town for spring training and decided to give this place a shot. We were both blown away by the service and the quality of food. I consider myself a bourbon snob, so the fact that they had selected their own barrel of Knob Creek 120 had me intrigued from the start.   For food we decided on the braised short rib and the bolognese.... Both were phenomenal and perfectly executed. We are not huge eaters, and we finished both plates.   Let's talk mixology; Gabe was top notch. I chose for him to construct a drink based on my likes and he knocked it out of the park.   Dessert - Gooey butter cake.... Enough said. You're missing out if you don't get it   All in all, Nick, Gabe and the entire staff were dedicated and passionate about their craft and it shows with the quality product that is delivered.   Well done. We are here for four days and will probably be back. Thank you for the great dining experience!!",

    "text": "Grabbed takeout from Nook Kitchen during a business trip & decided to order the Mushroom Pizza & Beet salad  Asked if they could make the salad veggie (since it came w/ bacon plus a bacon-vinaigrette & they happily obliged.  Subbed the dressing for a blood orange balsamic which was a wonderful option.  The salad was mostly arugula - there were very few beets & goat cheese dollops.  So for a standard salad this was okay but guess I'd been expecting thick slices of beets w/ just a little frisee  The pizza was wood fired & had a nice crisp crust.  Lots of mushrooms - decent but prob would look elsewhere for dinner in the future.  This was okay but would not consider it a destination spot when in the area",

When we went back mid January they had changed the menu.  Didn't realize when I order the scallops they were a complete different entre.  They are now grilled I believe they said.  A much more chewy kind of preparation ...I wasn't a fan.   But we like the restaurant, and were treated very well by the staff",

    "text": "I've been to Nook's popular flagship in Arcadia and remembered the experience with relative fondness, but its been awhile.  It was quite a coup for the new Downtown Phoenix Hilton Garden Inn to get a restaurant as popular as Nook as their marquee restaurant.  Curious to see how it stacked up against their original location, I decided to treat my Mom to a meal here on a hot summer Wednesday evening.  The Downtown location is much larger than the original with probably about three times as much indoor seating as well as patio seating (not in use during a 110 degree day of course, but still).  The interior does bare a pretty decent resemblance to the Arcadia location, albeit with a decidedly more urban flare.  You have to walk through the lobby of the hotel to get there, just FYI.  Also, I strongly recommend walking or biking here as parking is expensive.  It's valet parking only and costs $12 (and that's after validation).  One other thing a few Yelpers have accurately pointed out is that while the menu here is almost identical to the Arcadia location, the Downtown location's prices are noticeably higher.  Maybe the rent is way more expensive here?  On average it seems like most of the items are about $4-$5 more expensive at the Downtown location.  Just a few things to keep in mind.  Alright the food.  I'll just go into what I had.  We split an order of the Arancini to start off.  Seven fried balls of risotto and mozzarella cheese with a tomato puree and balsamic reduction.  A delicious start to be sure.  For my entree, I went with the Bolognese.  A hearty beef and pork pasta covered with copious amounts of a ground sausage and tomato sauce.  This will fill most stomachs all by itself and I really want to package that sauce for future use.  For dessert,  I grabbed a slice of the Ooey Gooey Butter Cake.  Basically a slice of super soft cheese cake topped with cream and a blueberry compote.  They hit all the right notes with this one and I really liked the texture of the crust.    Total price for my half of the Arancini, the Bolognese, the Ooey Gooey Butter Cake, tax and tip came to about $70.  If you're looking for a cheaper experience, my advice would be to come during happy hour and work the happy hour menu tapas style.  And again, arrive via bike or on foot (or even via light rail) if possible and save your car from the expensive valet.  So I'll say 3.5 stars for my first time here.  The prices are a little steep both in the restaurant and getting a parking spot, but the food at Nook is reliably solid and worth the trouble.  I'd probably still recommend the Arcadia location as a first option if you're on a tight budget, but the Downtown location is a welcome addition to the continuing Downtown culinary renaissance.",

    "text": "So...I went to the OG location down on Indian School a few months back, and had a pretty good pizza.  I saw that they had opened up a new spot here downtown, and I decided to swing by before my Cardinals vs Diamondbacks game.    I arrived a little after 4:30 and was one of two people in the place (other guy was sitting at the bar).  There were a ton of workers hanging out prepping the restaurant and getting everything ready for the dinner rush (if there was one?).  I knew what I was going to order before I even came in, so when my waitress came over, I ordered a glass of water and a Calabrese Pizza.  A little while later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was....................  Calabrese Pizza-  This was a white pizza and it came with house-pulled mozzarella, parmesan, taleggio, caramelized onions, sweet sausage, calabrian chiles, extra virgin olive oil and some basil.  It was delicious!  The sweet sausage was fantastic!  I ate a few pieces by itself, and it was spot on...just a great sweet Italian sausage!  The caramelized onions added some more sweetness on top of the sausage.  The mozzarella was nice and rich, and the calabrian chiles added a little \"pop\" to each bite.  All these delicious flavors were thrown upon a nice thin, charred crust.  It was thin, but not so thin that your slice would droop.  You could pick up each slice and enjoy it without knife and fork.  I dusted that pizza off in no time and was ready for the bill.  About that.............  The Calabrese pizza is normally $16.00.  When my waitress brought me my bill, it rang up at only $13.00.  I am assuming that pizzas are $3.00 off during Happy Hour?  I didn't ask, I kept my mouth shut and left my waitress a $20.00.    Service was excellent!  My waitress was very friendly and personable, and never let my water get below half full.  The space where they created this restaurant is pretty cool, too!  I'm sure I will be back at some point.  The pizza is pretty damn good and its right down near Chase Field and Talking Stick so its convenient to grab a bite to eat here before heading to a game.",

The interior of this restaurant is adorable and filled with eclectic things that somehow perfectly go together.  Clearly, much thought has gone into drinks as they are complex and interesting.  Food was fantastic as well.  Pizza is delish but several other items caught my eye too so a return trip is in order.  The dessert menu featured Gooey Butter Cake that we fully intended to order but were too full at the end.  Gooey Butter Cake is a St. Louis staple and it's always neat to see it outside of Missouri.   Our server was a doll and super attentive about dealing with everyone's allergies and food sensitivities.  She saw that the kitchen had mistakenly put nuts in a dish before we did - excellent catch!",

I feel like that is the best type of experience to have, it really gives any establishment the opportunity to wow their customers.  That's exactly what The Nook did for me.  I love how it is connected to a hotel with easy access from inside, also the decor was very modern and hipster-ish.  This \"new age\" restaurant atmosphere that numbers of restaurant owners have adopted is so amazing.  The Nook sets the ambiance to a very relaxed, comfortable feeling which makes it great to come in groups.   The mixologist Dustin is very skillful, and constructed the drink menu himself from my understanding.  He definitely sets the bar for any other bartender out there.  By experimenting with different aromas all the way to different types of seasonings.  He truly makes it a day to remember.  Check out my pics of the drinks he made, I attached the recipes.  I love how the city is coming to fruition, with so many new and upcoming restaurants like The Nook, it makes me proud to be a Phoenician.",

    "text": "We made a reservation to eat before going to see Kevin Hart. The manager that scheduled the reservation asked if we were celebrating anything and my wife told him 3 birthdays and an anniversary which they did not even acknowledge any! I am not looking for free stuff but if you are not going to acknowledge an event then don't ask. This reservation was made the week of the event but the manager said that they surprisingly were not very busy but that they would be prepared... this was not the case.  First, it took over 30 minutes to get our drinks and only 1 out of the 8 was a mixed drink and the rest were beers and 2 straight pours! The mixed drink was horrible and had to be sent back. The Appetizers were ok but we once again we had no drinks while eating them. The waitress said they were behind but there were plenty of tables open around us.  Next came dinner where the wheels really came off the wagon. The 2 steaks ordered were supposed to be medium well and they were served medium rare. You could get better eggplant parmesan from the frozen food isle. The prosciutto arugula pizza came out cold and when we told them, they said they would make a new one but we said we don't have time to wait and just to re-fire this one. Now any decent chef knows you take the arugula off the pizza before re-firing it but I guess they missed that class at Nook Kitchen. The pizza came back with what now looked like sauteed spinach on top of a pizza and tasted horrible. The manager came over and said he would make a new one and would take it off the bill. While we were waiting the table next to us only ordered pizzas and it took over 45 minutes to get them!  The only good review I can give was to the manager. He did listen to all of the problems and did his best to make it right. He also gave a very heart felt apology which was appreciated.",

    "text": "Flawless. From welcoming to service to walking out. As we got back to the truck I buckled in and looked over, telling Matt, \"I think my favorite part of the whole night was when we were leaving\". This confused him. We called ahead (we have a 2 year old in tote) they were welcoming of us bringing our toddler and as we walked in we were warmly greeted with a lighthearted joke about being a party of 2 and a half. We were ushered quickly to a lovely table next to the floor to ceiling windows (if you have a toddler, you understand this feature is more than aesthetically pleasing). The waitress (forgive me for not getting any names that evening) was patient and accommodating, quickly bringing out Laige's milk and then our drinks --let me tell you how dead that art form is on it's own! Laige, of course grew impatient with his high chair and the hostess brought over a coloring page and some crayons (Crayola I might add, not just the throw away wax). That kept him occupied long enough for our waitress to run us through the specials for the night (December 2, 2018).  Matt went with the lobster ravioli with a creamy tomato sauce and I went with the steak special that came topped with a poached pear, goat cheese and a beautiful tulle served over a seasonal hash. First of all my pictures do these plates NO justice. The ravioli was perfectly cooked, not falling off the fork on the way to your mouth and the lobster inside was rich and buttery married with the creamy sauce the first bite left you hungry for the next. Like that moment you finally feel comfort, last night comfort was wrapped in pasta and I can't say that doesn't make sense. The steak was ordered rare and cut like butter. I love the richness of a prime beef cut and married with the mild sweetness of the poached pear and the bit of tart from the creamy goat cheese. Chefs strive for an umami balance with every bite you take (food is more than just food to these people) and this dish completely achieved that sensation. Not to mention the bed of seasonal hash in which you can tell every component was dealt with individually which is how the proper mouth feel was achieved. A hash shouldn't be mush, but they knew that and took care to not make that mistake. We cleared our plates. Not a bite left.   But what meant the most to me was how we were thanked upon receiving the check, the clearing of the plates, as we packed up our son and again as we walked out the door. \"Thank you for coming in\" \"We are so glad you enjoyed your meal\" \"See you soon and thank you again for coming in\". It isn't very often a sense of community is built after a meal, but it is something I look for in any experience  we include our son in. And it was very special to have the opportunity to share a perfectly rounded experience with our little. I cannot thank the front house or kitchen staff enough! Above and beyond in every aspect! Highly recommend!!",

They were served with wonderful mashed potatoes and green beans cooked to perfection. My friend had the espresso rubbed filet, which was the best bite of steak I have ever had. Frank came over to make sure we were happy and told us that the meal had been created for his wedding, and was such a hit that it was added as a staple to the menu! It was accompanied by fingering potatoes seasoned to perfection and fresh veggies. I am not exaggerating when I say it was one of the most flavorful meals I've ever had! Service was great as well.",

First of all the GM Nick was outstanding, he accommodated everything to what we needed to make the bridal dinner amazing. His energy is what brought me into the restaurant. At one point in the night we ended up being the only table in the restaurant, Nick kindly asked if we would like to play other music and let's just say the bridal party loved it!! Nicks hospitality was outstanding and I will for sure be coming back because of him. The food was to die for, the green olive appetizer dish is amazing. Everyone's food was amazing, couldn't go wrong with anything food wise. The drinks are out of the world as well. I highly recommend Nook Kitchen and I will be back for sure with more friends and family!!!",

Our server, Drew, was personable and funny and made us feel welcome right from the start, and the food was insanely good.  We ordered the meatball appetizer, which was delicious and just the right size for two, and a Diavolo pizza.  Normally anything Diavolo is pretty spicy hot, but the pizza had just enough heat (from the soppressata) to keep things interesting, and again was just right for two people.  Now, a pizza's a pretty simple thing.  There's a fine line sometimes between a truly outstanding pizza and just a pizza.  This pizza was outstanding - great crust, great ingredients, cooked to perfection.  Drew was there throughout checking up on us, answering our silly questions about Phoenix history,  and just generally giving excellent service.  The Nook has a pretty good wine list, although we did not indulge, and the music and overall atmosphere are comfortable and relaxing.  We would absolutely eat here again.",

Good, efficient service and you can get out of there for under $20. Dinner is a different matter. It's in hotel of course so you're going to pay a premium. But boy did we feel like we were eating hotel food. We start with an inspired garden salad and then had a boring, bland eggplant Napoleon ($23!!) and totally meh salmon with over salted cauliflower mash. I might go back just for pizza or a drink but won't touch the dinner entrees again unless I get snowed in the hotel.",

We started with the shrimp cocktail and the shrimp were a great size, but there was A LOT of horseradish in the cocktail sauce which took us both by surprise. I had the scallops which were delicious, and my boyfriend was very pleased with the lamb shank. We finished with the ooey gooey buttery cake and that was very good, kind of reminded me of a sugar cookie and cheesecake in one.",

Everything is a bit overpriced compared to surrounding restaurants and there is a price discrepancy from their current menu and the one listed online on yelp.",

We expected more out of this place based on reviews and especially the price. Brucshetta was medeocre and the pasta was not good at all.",

I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and a side salad. The salad was plain no flavor and lacked dressing. The Shrimp was over cooked and it's tasted like rubber. The linguini tasted rancid, nothing special about the sauce. I literally could not continue on eating the rancid taste the linguini had. Keep in mind this plate cost $27 and only included three shrimps. I could careless for the price, but at least focus on the taste. I will avoid this place at all cost when visiting Phoenix. Just horrible!!!",

Fantastic stack of breaded and fried eggplant, shuffled with cheese and a light sauce.  Wow, that was good.

The avocado bowl was so so so plain and TINY portion you could literally toss this up yourself at home and it would definitely not cost that much. The romaine salad was alright... didn't come with much either and the chicken was soooo dry. Overall experience was pretty average and server wasn't that attentive either.",

It is perfect for special occasions, entertaining guests or simply enjoying happy hour with friends.   For dinner, the chicken masala gets three thumbs-up. Wow! It's really out of this world delicious. Ask for the wine pairing to go with this dish. It is large Enough to share, if you go in for that sort of thing, making it perfect for a full evening of cocktails (I love the deconstructed mule, very refreshing), appetizers (the olives are delightful! Served warm, drenched in hot olive oil...stop!), dinner with a bottle of wine (ask for the perfect pairing), dessert and coffee. Yeah, all that.   To top it off, everyone will make you feel warmly welcomed and a part of the neighborhood.   Much thanks to Nick for pulling together the perfect blend of ambiance, personality and good vibrations.   Now, if they could update the speaker system, it would be heaven. Until then, I'll settle for a slice of paradise.",

The staff was so accommodating and sweet.  We ordered all our food in a rush and it was the most delicious dishes it made me sad to had hurry! We had the calamari (among the best I've ever had, light with a red wine reduction for dipping) the bruschetta fig goat cheese (sans asparagus per my request).  My husband had the salmon, which was cooked to perfection served with a root vegetable hash, and I had the linguine. I squealed with delight when I realized there was a poached egg yolk hidden in the noodles, which made the dish fresh and light.  Sadly we only could enjoy one cocktail and run, and I had a deconstructed Moscow mule and the garnish alone was so fragrant, the drink delicious and not overly sweet.  We will definitely be back to slowly dine and enjoy ourselves next time :)",

When we were ordering dessert the manager saw we still had food left and offered to box it up. We told him we had to walk to a comedy show for a few hours and thus would be unable to take it with us. He told us they would gladly keep our food in the refrigerator for us to pick up once we finished. We were astonished! But we were so happy to get to eat our amazing leftovers for another meal! When we ordered our dessert they let us know that our dessert would be on the house in honor of our anniversary. It's not super cheap dessert at $10 (though it was worth that and more!)  We have never had better service in our lives! We will absolutely be returning and telling everyone we know to head over here and give this place a try.",

    "text": "Five stars for the staff. The bartender has a fantastic attitude and a darn good sense of humor. He asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar since I was alone. I said no thanks since I've been in front of a large group speaking all day. I wanted a cozy table all to myself. His sense of humor and generous spirit had me laughing and somewhat regretting not sitting at the bar. Thank you for the smiles!   The waitress was helpful and attentive. The manager visited to ensure my evening was going well. Five stars times three for all three staff members I encountered.  Five stars for the specialty cocktail. It's monsoon season in Phoenix 100+ degree heat...so it's not a dry heat! I wanted a mojito to cool off and shake off my rough day, and although it wasn't on the menu, the bartender made a spectacular version with fresh mint and a blood lime. Yes, folks; it's a green lime on the outside with red flesh on the inside. It was a flavorful and perfectly balanced mojito. Too bad I have to work tomorrow and didn't want to risk a second drink.   Five stars for the ambiance. Comfortable and stylish seating in the modern and Art Deco style is everywhere you look. There's the bright bar area, a darker and private alley of tables, open restaurant seating, etc. I sat in a plush velvet chair and sunk into the lushness, which helped relax my stressful state. I could work on my phone in privacy and yet feel enveloped in comfort.   The food is the big old snag here. I asked the waitress if I should order the short ribs or a gluten-free pizza. She said the short ribs without a doubt, so even though it was twice the price of a pizza, I went for it. The green beans, sauce, and mashed potatoes were delicious. The meat was disappointingly dry...dry...dry like I wish the Phoenix heat is. Chuckle! I received an impressively large portion, so I was initially pleased. Then, I tasted the short ribs and realized the portion is big because they are trying to get rid of it. Shucks. It could have been a raving 5-Star review all around, but the food is barely worth three stars. I really should drop a star for the lack of gluten-free options on the menu in each category. For example, if you want dessert, forget it. There isn't a gluten-free option, so you might as well stop by the front desk and buy an outrageously priced roll of Rolos if you're craving chocolate.   Overall, I gave four stars, but if you are only interested in food, don't eat here. I really was hoping for a wonderful meal since I'm a foodie, but I still walked away mostly satisfied because of the staff and ambiance. Thanks for a pleasant evening in general!",

We started with the arancini, which are amazing fried risotto balls.   Yummmmm.  These were good!  We were able to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather too.  I was craving comfort food and sticking to an Italian theme, as I tend to do; fresh pasta is hard for me to turn down.  Hello, bolognese!  I thought their pasta was tasty.  I ate every noodle.  If I go back, I'll have to give their pizza a try.  No complaints here really good food and service from our end.",

It's located in the lobby inside the Hilton Garden Inn so in order to get there you will need to enter through the hotels entrance.   Service was great.  Everyone was accommodating, efficient, friendly and our server was wonderfully patient as it took my friend and I a good 20 minutes just to order our drinks. Sorry dude, we're girls and we need to get all of our talking out before we stuff our faces.   The menu consisted of standard lunch options: pizza, bruschetta, salads, sandwiches, etc.  We decided to order the caprese bruschetta as well as the fig and share the two.  The caprese was fine.  Nothing spectacular but it got the job done.  The fig however was outstanding.  It was made up of fig jam, prosciutto, goat cheese and asparagus.  It was like a slightly more savory version of my favorite prosciutto and brie sandwich from Postino.  I thought the asparagus wouldn't bled well with the other toppings but it provided a nice contrast of flavor and crunch.   The atmosphere in here is rad and I would love to come back in the evening to check out their dinner menu and see how this place transforms at night.",

Unfortunately the food was very.... mediocre, especially for the price. $55 for one beer, one appetizer, and one entree. We try to go out to eat to places that have food that we can't make at home, and everything we ate didn't taste any better than what I could have made myself using the same ingredients. I felt like we were at a diner and an untrained line cook made our food, which is why the price of the food seemed so ridiculous. The bruschetta bread was so under toasted that I had to use two hands to hold it or the toppings would have just fallen off. The short rib meat was tender, but the only flavor to it was sweetness, the potatoes were bland, and there was no texture variation to anything we ate. If you want this kind of food, save your money and hit up your local fast service restaurant.",

When I heard about Nook I of course was excited since I just went and visited the other location.  We arrived about 830 on a Saturday night. Tons of traffic due to who knows what! Valet was full no problem so I parked around the block. Walking in the decor and ambience makes you feel comfortable. The colors vibrant and subtle.  I fell in love with the chair at our table,  I felt like a queen!   The menu has all the same plus some new additions as well. I already knew to order a pizza from a previous visit in Arcadia. My boyfriend decided on the Diavolo. A red sauce pizza with basil and a somewhat spicy meat. Amazing!   I ordered the Short Rib. The picture I have will show just how wonderful it was. The entree came with leek mashed potatoes and baby green beans. We shared the food and loved every bite! Compliments to the chef. We were checked on a few times and made sure we had everything we needed.   We normally do not get dessert as we do not have room in our tummies, but a lovely old friend of my boyfriends came by and recommended the oooy gooey butter cake! Oh yeah! We made room for that for sure. All I can say is we are craving to go back very soon!   Go by and support this place! It is connected to the new Hilton Garden on a Monroe. Check out the lovely patio or dine inside and enjoy a wonderful meal!",

The food is slightly above average, the pasta came out a little too al debate for my taste and the Bolognese is average. They just use ground beef instead of other beefs.

They offered both inside and outside seating and I love how they use the wine wall to separate a part of the dining room next to the bar.  I started off with a Moscow mule and I loved loved that the drink was served in a copper mug. I know it's only a mug but when I order that drink, i expect it to be served in a copper mug. The beer choices were also really good. Then we ordered the Charcuterie plate which was amazing!!! The portion was generous and everything on the plate was so delicious. It's one of the best charcuterie plates I've tasted. I was a little bummed that it was served on a plate instead of a cheese board but it was so good that it didn't matter. Then for our main dish we ordered the baby scallops served with grill white asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, grilled potato coins, white chocolate bean cream topped with fried wonton strips. The scallops were plump and juicy and it had a nice sweet taste from the white chocolate bean sauce. Overall I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, the food was delicious and our server was great. For our 3 drinks, appetizer and main entree our bill came out to $100 which is a bit pricy but at least the food was amazing so it was money well spent!",

We decided to stay and give this place a try and we are so glad we did! The atmosphere is great! We started off with some drinks from the bar, all of which were delicious! Our table ordered several starters and bruschetta instead of entrees. We enjoyed everything we ordered! The food was presented wonderfully and tasted even better. Not to mention, the staff was SO attentive!! We had never noticed that they were short staffed because they did a great job at making us feel like we were important to each person that came by our table. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Once they found out it was my daughters birthday they all made sure to say happy birthday to her also  We will definitely be returning to Nook Kitchen once we're back in town!!",

I love bruschetta, my favorite is probably Postinos or Olive and Ivy, the Nook surprised me by beating out them both with their artichoke bruschetta. It's a must order. I had the short rib as my meal and the meat was high quality and cooked perfectly, the flavor was exactly as it should be, rich and warm. Their service is also really good, our waitress was attentive and unobtrusive. Their prices are fair and not too high. This is a great date night place!

We had a set menu because of it being a reserved party, but that was fine with me because they had options available for me that I knew I would like.  The olives were delicious. I didn't think I'd like them because they were warmed up, but they were actually pretty good. I also had the espresso rubbed filet which was magical. So good and cooked just like I had asked. The Grand Marnier dragon carrots were excellent. The fingerling potatoes were great. That white truffle cream sauce was boss.  I'd definitely come back here if I was staying in the area again.",

The pizza was super cheesy, very flavorful, I didnt read the description thoroughly and didn't realize there were hot peppers in the pizza so it does have a little kick! We had told the staff it was our 6 year anniversary and they hooked us up with a free dessert, the mousse cake was yummy but the standout was the espresso icecream.  The staff was very accommodating.

    "text": "This is Nook's second location, located within the Hilton Garden Inn in Downtown Phoenix on Monroe Street. I originally reviewed their Indian School spot and gave them a solid three stars due to having respectable but somewhat pricey foods, with lots of hits and misses with their menu. And honestly, in terms of the overall experience, I'd say that this location is more or less the same. The restaurant itself has a cool setup and unlike the spot on Indian School, also features an outdoor patio.   We started with a half-order of their fig bruschetta, which includes fig jam, prosciutto, asparagus, and a bit of goat cheese. This item has always been consistently good, while their polpetinne (fried risotto balls) were fine as well.  We've experimented with their menu before by trying their bolognese and being disappointed. I assume their chicken marsala is still very good, while I'd imagine that their poutine (gravy fries) also delivers. We decided to skip these options, however, and just get a diavolo pizza.  Nook's pizza is a bit weird. Ingredients are fine and crust has always had solid flavor, but their pizzas are always served incredibly dry and floury, in stark contrast to what we're used to at most places. I guess it's more of a subjective thing, but I never find myself to be impressed as much as I wish I could be.  For dessert, their options are a bit different than what we remembered. We decided to order their buttercake, which seemed more like a cheesecake than anything else. The dish heavily incorporates graham crackers, including a ganache and an actual miniature graham cracker itself. The dessert was good, but if you're familiar with buttercake, you might be a little thrown off.  Our server was incredibly slow - and I mean painfully slow in comparison to the usual quick service we receive at Nook. The place wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, so I'm not sure what that was about.  Prices are a bit high, which I've never felt are fully justified. Overall, I'd still recommend Nook as a place to try out. Although the food isn't quite as impressive as I think it could potentially be, it definitely has its fair share of fans.",

    "text": "Nook Kitchen is the hotel bar and restaurant for the Hilton Garden Inn.  Dinner service is upscale and the prices are typical of a hotel restaurant.   They are $$$ especially when you consider other options with a stones throw of the place.  It is loud.  Sports on the big screens in the bar but it has dark corners and candle light.  Not sure what the ambiance they are trying to achieve.  I ordered Chicken Marsala and a green salad.  The salad was small and challenging to eat; croutons are supposed to be crunchy- but not a dental risk. My salad is long gone and I am still waiting for my chicken.  At least the server is good about refilling my tea. I am waffling between two and three stars and thinking I will need to get a snack after this meal; if it ever arrives... It arrived! It must have taken so long because they were over cooking the pasta into a starchy blob.  The  sauce has enough salt for the entire meal. I should have walked across the street and had the Tacos de Tinga at Centeico.   I won't be coming back. *** Update *** Color me impressed.  I posted the review and Nicholas, the very social media aware manager,  came by my table almost before my phone was put away.  He offerd to make things right and explained that he was down two people in the kitchen.   I will come back another night just because he showed he cared.",

With the challenge in downtown Phoenix, this place has great potential but needs focus on the staff",

My fiance ordered the featured meal of the night, though she didn't enjoy it as much on the count of there being too much butter settled in the bottom of the dish. The restaurant owner so happened to notice her lack of interest in the dish, and very sincerely asked for her \"constructive criticism\" before he explained how the dish was prepared. After some good conversation and understanding, the owner thanked us for our opinion and didn't make us pay for her meal -- along with giving us free dessert. Overall, we were very pleased with Nook Kitchen and would recommend it to anyone.",

Even got a visit from the bar manager who explained the origins and plant derivations in their tequilas as well as tasted a few samples. Only thing short of giving 5 stars was the food. The bruschetta, which came highly recommended btw, was cold and the bread wasn't toasted as much as I'd prefer. Also, the price for 4 small pieces seemed a bit steep to me ($16). The pizza was tasty but not the best. Their butter cake dessert was delicious, however and my friends enjoyed their salads. Overall, would definitely return!",

Well, this is a VERY popular restaurant, but they couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. The hostess was gracious & gave us a perfect table. When 2 more members of our group showed up, they didn't complain, but went out of their way to seat them with us & make them feel welcome. Besides the wonderful ambiance, THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE!!! I won't say we licked our plates, but there wasn't much left as those plates headed back to the kitchen :)  And, finally, if you get to pick your server, go with COREY! He was friendly, charming & professional & added to the fun evening that we had. I just wish we were staying longer so we could go back!",

It was highly rated but I was skeptical as I walked up realizing it was a hotel. All prejudgments were totally unsubstantiated.   The ambiance was very pleasant even though a little crowded. Service was impeccable and fast. I went with my Son and wife. I had the Poutine (Canadian Comfort Food) with braised pork. It was fabulous. Portion was huge and served hot. The braised pork was amazing. My Son had the Seared Scallops. How do you define perfect...I do a pretty good seared scallop but this was a whole new dimension in reality of how a scallop should be cooked. It was so soft and tasty the one that was offered to me by my son soon became 2! My wife had a nice pizza with veggies. She saw someone else get it and was enamored with the presentation and was not disappointed in taste. It was like we did a rotation of foods. My wife was sharing my Poutine and I was sharing my sons scallops and he was sharing my wife's pizza. Each one of us had nothing but good comments of each others dish.   I can highly and without reserve recommend this as a great place to eat when downtown.",

    "text": "Well Nook in Arcadia has been one of my favorite places in Phoenix but this location is on a whole other level of amazing! The attention to detail in the atmosphere is captivating! I appreciate some of the historic hotel elements incorporated into the modern decor. It still maintains the cozy, welcoming Italian home vibe that Nook is all about- \"Come to the table and let's savor an amazing meal and enjoy each others' company\" kinda vibe.  The service is excellent and the food just WOWs you. Chef Nick LaRosa is a culinary genius.   Do yourself a favor and don't skip dessert: get the Affogato. Yes, even after lunch- I assure you, you'll get more work done!",

The restaurant is adorable and beautiful. It has a cozy, romantic atmosphere- perfect for a date. I went for my birthday dinner with girlfriends. It's inside the Hilton hotel and you have to enter through the lobby. There's a bar and a cute little living room setup to wait for your table. The food is amazing! We shared the fig bruschetta, which could've used a little more goat cheese but was very tasty. It only comes with 4 pieces, which worked out because there were 4 of us. One of my friends got the short rib which she loved; even the green beans had an amazing flavor. The shrimp fra diavolo was also great, but beware, it is spicy! Another one of my friends couldn't stop eating the filet she ordered because it was so good. I wanted the lamb shank, but they didn't have it anymore. I was really disappointed until I tasted the chicken marsala. It was by far the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place. I'm definitely coming back!",

My guest and I had the Arnacini, which is basically fried mozzarella with some really tasty sauce.5/5. I also had the chicken chop salad, which I found to be pretty good. 4/5. The reason I am giving this restaurant five stars is because of the ambience and the service. Our server was Hannah, and she was great! The building is a refurbished art deco structure from the 1930s that has been turned into a modern hotel with a fairly hip lobby and nice bar. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant if you are downtown and want to grab a quality lunch.",

Not recommended for kids- I think most of the patrons would prefer you don't bring your kids :). Italian theme food.  I was able to make a reservation directly from Yelp- bonus!  Parking is easy nearby.  I really liked this restaurant and would recommend it to others.  Ordered the Rigatoni and the salmon entrees- both were tasty.  Really liked the root vegetable hash that was served with the salmon.  The surprise dish however was dessert- the pistachio apricot tart!  Save room for this, you can thank me later.  A few small things I observed and would recommend for the restaurant to improve- no show stoppers this is still a really good restaurant:  - would recommend they add tablecloths, it would make the place warmer and more appealing .  After all this is Italian!  The candles are already there, tablecloths would be a natural fit. - have matching chairs at the tables!  They had at least 3 very different styles of chairs mixed in, it was like they furnished the place from a surplus store - put more than 3 shrimp in the rigatoni dish - concrete floors and the big open shared space gets loud with the crowds.  Not sure the acoustics could be improved given the layout   And a reminder, order the pistachio apricot tart dessert, even if you have to box it up and eat it later!",

I was too captivated to try the other cocktails, but someone at this bar seriously knows what they're doing!  Try to trust me on this.

    "text": "After catching a concert at Valley Bar, we decided to grab some food at Nook since it was AZ Restaurant Week and less than a block away. The interior of Nook has a great classic, chic atmosphere but it was a nice evening in downtown Phoenix so we sat outside on the patio. The service was prompt, very attentive and offered the Arizona Restaurant Week menu right away.   Here's the lowdown on the food we ate:   Appetizer: Arancini - A crisp exterior with a creamy, cheesy, risotto filled center. The squiggle of balsamic reduction on the side added some tartness and acidity to cut through the heaviness of the creamy risotto. Perfection!   Entree: Eggplant Parmesan Napoleon - So filling! Layer upon layer of breaded eggplant, thick garlic pomodoro sauce, mozzarella cheese, repeated then topped off with a pile of freshly chopped basil. Oh, so cheesy and a slight hint of a spicy aftertaste.  Dessert: Olive Oil Lemon Ricotta - An airy extra virgin olive oil lemon ricotta cake topped with strawberry and rosemary compote and a scoop of delicious olive oil ice cream. We were informed the cake has been changed slightly from the description. It was topped with a blueberry sauce instead of strawberry compote. Not sure if that was just for the evening or a full time change? The blueberry was good but I think I would have preferred the strawberry with the this cake.   NOTE: Bathrooms are located within the Hilton Garden Inn, which is a nice excuse to check out the swanky lobby of the hotel. If you are around the area, I recommend you stopping in for a bite to eat at Nook Kitchen.",

We ordered the artichoke chicken bruschetta for appetizer, the salmon and one of the pizzas for dinner . The salmon came with grilled zucchini and mashed cauliflower which was delicious . My husbands pizza had great flavor and  a nice thin crust, minus the chicken he added which ended up being burnt . The best part of the meal was the ooey gooey butter cake for desert !! Amazing flavor and texture. Don't be scared by this restaurant being attached to the Hilton ... it was overall good food , great ambiance and service was excellent!",

    "text": "Nook, I am so in love with you. After almost a disaster of a night, we came across Nook and decided to try it. It had a warm vibe perfect for a first date. I can't remember the last time I looked at a drink and food menu and wanted everything. The calamari pizza is nothing short of culinary genius. It tasted like heaven! The Moscow mule drink they had was incredible too and I don't even like Moscow Mules. If you're counting macros like me, I got the broccolini and chicken pizza which tasted super healthy! Didn't even feel like a cheat meal. I cannot wait to come back.   Date Rating: 2 out of 5. I was excited to go out with Camilo. He seemed all tall dark and handsome and sweet. We started the date at another restaurant I have rated and we didn't get service for about 40 minutes. I have to be a boss and in control seven days out of the week. I expect a man to see I'm visibly agitated, take the reins, and fix it, no questions asked. It would have been so attractive and logical for him to just WALK UP and grab a waitress. But he was timid, he kept saying he was going to but looked forlornly at the passing waiters. I honestly don't want to have to be the one to make things happen all the time, it's tiring. The waitress was also ignoring me so when he mentioned that we leave, I practically hopped out of my seat. I already knew that the date probably couldn't be salvaged here but I was starving. So I chose Nook. At the previous place, he wanted to split a plate (no) so I was wondering if he could afford the date in the first place. I don't like cheap guys because I treat myself and my loved ones all the time. There's nothing wrong with being on a budget, just date someone else and please don't restrict me and waste my time. He said he didn't want anything on Nook's menu (again, it all sounded amazing!) It's all pasta and pizza... who tf can't eat pasta and pizza? He then offered to take me to a dive bar a couple blocks down with \"great pizza.\" At this point I am exasperated, hungry, and tired of putting on this sweetheart act so I tell him that we can reschedule the date because it seems like it's just not our lucky night. He seemed to notice the disappointment in my eyes and quickly changed his tune. He suddenly found something he liked on the menu and we ordered drinks. We laughed and swapped stories and it was a typical first date. I will not be seeing Camilo again.",

    "text": "I don't know what I spent $40 dollars on last night. I was staying at the Hilton Garden Inn attached to the hotel. I had a long day so I decided to stay in and pick up from the restaurant since the menu looked so good I ordered the fried calamari and the shrimp caesar salad. Like I said, my bill was $42. When I opened my fried calamari, it looked fine. The sauce was a little lacking. It was a Cabernet reduction. It was good but they didn't put enough. The Caesar salad was three shrimp with a bunch of lettuce...for $25. AND they didn't toss the lettuce, just gave  me a salad dressing container which didn't cover the bag of lettuce they gave me so I had three shrimp with dry lettuce.   Based on their rating, I guess some people have had a good experience here. Perhaps I ordered wrong. I expect that if I pay $25 for a salad, it's pretty good.   I suggest you take more pride in take-out orders ESPECIALLY since you're attached to a hotel. If we choose take-out, it's because we've probably had a long day and want something good to eat. (Again, especially at your prices)   Shame.",

I came here with my husband, mother in law and sister in law back in February when Shen Yun was in town.  We don't make it to Phoenix often but when looking for a place to eat, Nook Kitchen looked like the perfect restaurant to enjoy a fabulous evening with my family.  We were seated at a table in the corner right when you come in the restaurant from the Hilton Garden Hotel entrance.  The waitress who seated us was very sweet.  I loved our table because it was cozy and quiet.  We could see the entire restaurant from our table and I was really impressed with all the beautiful lights and decor.  Our waiter, Drew, was very nice and welcomed us warmly to the restaurant (it was our first time).  We ordered the Arancini Bites and Calamari for appetizers.  SOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!  We also got some fabulous cocktails.  I ordered the Re-constructed Mule and fell in love with it!  It was probably the most delicious cocktail I have ever had.  It had all my favorites in it.  Our entrees were also amazing!  Drew was the best waiter we have ever had.  Nicholas, who is the manager/owner, also came out and talked with us and made sure everything was good.  Drew and Nicholas both made our night... they are such nice guys!  I dream about Nook Kitchen LOL  Such an amazing place!  We will be in Phoenix again soon and I cannot wait to come back here!",

    "text": "This was my second time dining at Nook Downtown. It wasn't just a fluke the first time, it wasn't a dream, I wasn't just really hungry...They really are just that good! This time I brought my friend and business partner since I had been raving about the food here he decided it was time to go. Corey was our server he was polite, friendly, and again with this staff - they now just how much to come around so you don't feel like you're being watched or ignored. Margaret my server from last month remembered me and even stopped to say hello! Nicholas the manager came around to say hello and introduce himself and tell us a bit about the restaurant and menu.  This dinner was an all out for us - cocktails, appetizer, entrees, AND FINALLY dessert!  My friend, Nick had a Jameson on the rocks (his usual) and I went with the Mule (it has more of a name, but I forgot). Nicholas made us a new cocktail that doesn't (yet have a name: Cin/Aperol, Eucalyptus Cordial, Galliano, and Lemon Juice. I'm not really a Gin kind of gal, but it was pretty! For our appetizer, we had the Chicken Artichoke Bruschetta. O.M.G. You could taste every ingredient in it. the artichoke, the Parmesan, the roasted garlic ricotta, the chicken. Creamy & smooth. The bread, as always was perfect. Thick and sturdy enough to hold the mountain of deliciousness, but still soft enough to actually bite into it without cutting the roof of my mouth.   We each got an entree to share - the Bolognese and the Quattro Formaggio e Aglio. Ho-Ly Goodness in my mouth. The Bolognese was made with pappardelle pasta and it was cooked perfectly. The souce was spicy, but not too much - just enough so that you could enjoy it and it compliments the other flavors in the dish. THE PIZZA... Ok, if you've ever had pizza in Italy, this is definitely on par with that. TRUST us. The taste of garlic in this pizza was fantastic. You could really taste it and it didn't overpower your mouth and diminish the other flavors. All the cheeses melted perfectly to create a cheese masterpiece on a crust. The Ricotta, OH THE RICOTTA!!! I'm in love. Things that were said about this pizza: \"This pizza is like the Best Of of cheeses\" \"This is like Cheese Pizza Greatest Hits Album\" \"This is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth\" \"This is like pizza crack\"  Ooey. Gooey. Butter. Cake. Ok... I couldn't believe this. Nick and I aren't big on sweet things, but this... this damn cake. Creamy, smooth, light, and packed with flavor. It was quite honestly one of the best desserts I'e had. The ice cream (caramel? honey? either way it was amazing) was a perfect compliment to the creamy smooth cake. Paired with those blueberries and MMM.  You can tell that this restaurant takes pride in their food and is serious about using fresh ingredients (why they aren't open for lunch). I applaud the whole staff for excelling in their craft. It shows. And it shows that they believe and are proud of their product. The service was as always wonderful, the food just as amazing. Thank you again for a great dining experience.  -ACS",

Although I suspect with the staff we met, they handle customers just fine, busy or slow. Our server Margaret was excellent.  Pre-meal cocktails were the Cherry Blossom (something like that) and Ciao Bella. Both were very tasty drinks. We opted for the Arancini (1/2 order) and warm Caprese salad to start. The Arancini was good, but the warm Caprese was amazing! We were immediately trying to figure out how to make this at home. I think it's may be worth the trip to Nook just to try this dish out. We split the nightly special, a beef stew with a generous helping of mushroom risotto. We told the server that it wasn't right to make this an occasional special. It was too good to not have on the menu nightly! Seriously, I wanted another order to take home.",

I had chicken and vegetables, one or two beers and while talking about harder spirits, I was given a taste of a Knob Creek Rye (delicious and amazing) as well as a taste of a \"sipping tequila\", Forteleza. I could not have been made to feel more welcome, and in a downtown scene whose restaurants are usually tied to a hotel, this was a great step towards culinary and imbibing perfection.

They were all willing to help me out and the chef was going to make something that wasn't the standard plate of pasta or a bowl of veggies. I left it up to the chef entirely and OMG he did not let me down! Chef made a grilled portobello mushroom with a ratatouille with pears poach in red wine with sun choke chips and a little hummus with ribbon cut carrots. This was AMAZING!!!! I don't know if I've ever had food that good in my mouth ever! I ordered the Salmon which was amazing but had I known I would have ordered a second of what the chef made for my wife! I can't say thank you enough to the chef and the manager Nick and all of the staff at Nook Kitchen my wife was floored by the effort and instantly fell in love with this place. You will not be disappointed and I am a lifelong customer after this amazing experience!",

It did not fill up through out the evening. The pizza oven was broken so I didn't have pizza. I then tried to order Bolognese, no luck. So I asked what they did have and ended up with a more expensive dish.  It was ok. Will not go back.",

So onto the negative:  the warm caprese... no flavor and the toast points were gummy,  artichokes not cooked long enough, meatballs eh, the bruchetta.. again on gummy bread.  Salmon-simply off tasting, its sides seriously needing seasoning and we're cold!  Scallops also lukewarm, eggplant parm, while impressive looking- BURNT! Couldn't eat.  The chicken on my salad also burnt!  The pastas were flavorless!  Walked out with a 450 bill and felt robbed!!!",

Service was good (3.5 stars), the ambiance great (4 stars), but it was the food that stole the show, well the pizza anyways (5 stars). We got a white sauced pie with sausage and caramelized onions. The crust was perfect, thin enough to have some crunch but still thick enough to have substance. This would be a five star review but the Italian sandwich was soggy (the bread is flat bread and hadn't been fired properly). We sent it back and weren't charged.",

Fresh mozzarella, olives, dried apricot pieces and fig jam accompany the meats so well that I will visit again JUST for this menu offering. Well done!",

We ordered the lamb shank and the Chicken Marsala.   The lamb was well-seasoned and tender... could have used some green veggies perhaps as a side to boost the health factor and overall profile. Or alternately, it would be nice to have an option to order the lamb in a stew (or with a side of the sauce the lamb is cooked in) for a juicier experience.   The Chicken Marsala was the star; actually the best we've had in the valley. It needed more liquid or sauce, but as far as the flavor, it was impressive. Delicate, balanced and well-crafted... and just enough sweetness. The mushrooms and Marsala wine elements came through nicely. This is a must-order when you visit.  I should also mention that dessert was wonderful - a chocolate Budino (sort of a creamy custard or pudding). It was rich and moist and decadent... didn't get too much of the Espresso flavor though. Recommend this with a vanilla ice cream instead of the lemon it came with.  Bravo, Nook!",

( go see it) As I got off the Light Rail I noticed this location. I have been wanting to eat at Nook for a long time now but was more familiar with the reputation of the Arcadia location. Needless to say I ran in to try it.   I was seated at the bar immediately by friendly folks. I ordered a soda and watched the bartenders making drinks. So I got my drink and was finally able to relax after another difficult day at work. I opened my purse to get out my phone to call my Dad and lo and behold I noticed that my wallet is missing. OMGOSH, I am scrounging for change at the bottom to pay for my drink. I was so embarrassed and in a panic. The staff could not have been nicer. I promised to come back and did the next day.   I ordered the Calabrese Pizza and for dessert I had the Apricot Tart with Pistachio Ice Cream. The food was just as amazing as I had heard and the service was truly one of the bet I have ever had.   I am grateful Nick and Gabe did not force me to wash dishes and miss the play. Come to think of it, I am in the job market for a new job since retiring.  Sometimes all it takes is an act of kindness. You never know what battles people are fighting. Nice people and outstanding food goes a long way! I sure will be back to try some of those salads, apps, and Gooey Cake.",

I was past In & Out... I needed something more. Someone raved about the Jerk Chicken. And after a little bit of investigation I found out maybe Nook was the place to go. So I convinced my friends to go... And in kinda glad I did. In the middle of the seating the manager reached out with a big giagantic smile and lots of energy. That  reassured us we were in the right place. My reviews are always mostly based on the experience of my friends. They had no complaints. They said it was a great experience and just based on that I will give this place a 5 star. Totally recommend! This Hilton is a nice place to just come in, but to find food like this is definitely a plus. There were one or 2 annoyances that I would definitely share in any other occasion, but after so much care and based on the flavor of their food this place gets its 5th star. Based on overall efforts this is a good place to crash while downtown. Talking about food can we talk about the fried chicken? Woooow! Amazing. Is the cook Southern? This chicken was right on point!  The price for the special is a bit too high but I'm sure you can always find some other options as well. Overall I liked Nook.",

The drinks are always as they should be and if not the bartenders never fail to accommodate.  This go round we only had appetizers (wood fired olives and calamari) both highly recommended.  One other plus is the music selection is always refreshing and eclectic.  Definitely recommend this place for anyone interested in great consistent food and drink.",

The staff was nice and pleasant and the atmosphere was upscale. I actually felt a little dressed down, it looked like a fancy place. I ordered the pistachio pizza which tasted great and seemed to be actually wood fired. I also ordered the ooey gooey butter cake. It came with a lot of details that honestly I didn't care about as my server described them, but the flavors were a little too drastic for me having a semi sweet cake, ice cream and blueberry compote then a very salty spread. All in all not a bad place to try if you want a more classic upscale Italian restaurant that's not just going to slap together a cheap fettuccine Alfredo.",

    "text": "I've had Nook Kitchen bookmarked for so long and finally got around to trying it. I didn't even know there was a downtown location to be honest but I'm glad there is.  I had some sort of scotch \"health\" cocktail that had sage in the ice cube - prob a horrible description but I can tell you that I liked it enough to get a second one. Others in our group had the Hopsicle and enjoyed as well. The cocktail menu was interesting - I'd like to go back and try more!  We all shared the chopped chicken salad, the caprese appetizer and the arancini. The caprese appetizer came was warm ooey gooey melted mozzarella cheese goodness - major cheese pulls. Arancini was a great dish to share, as well as the chopped chicken salad. I could probably eat the salad as an entree and be full but who really wants a salad as their main dish?  For our meals, two of us had the scallops and the other two went with the espresso rubbed filet mignon. All of us were very happy with our meals. I felt like I inhaled all of my scallops - I didn't even share with my fiance.   Dessert: We all shared the butter cake and the lemon ricotta cake. Personally, I enjoyed the lemon ricotta cake more than the butter cake. The butter cake had the consistency of a lemon bar - thick and full of butter, hence the name. I'm getting married this weekend and have been trying to lay off large amounts of butter - just kidding.   Overall, I'm looking forward to going back to Nook Kitchen!",

Thankfully the 2nd restaurant turned what could have been a bad vacation night into something great. As avid fine diners, my husband and I could not believe the horrible experience we had at Nook kitchen: On Saturday, Luis and I had reservations at a place in Phoenix called Nook Kitchen.  We did our research for weeks and had our heart set on it. It was located inside an upscale hotel, and reminded us of Hotel Fullerton's restaurant which we are regulars at. I was very specific about the reservation and let them know we were celebrating my birthday and our wedding anniversary.  We get to the restaurant and it takes forever for us to flag the hostess down, yet she seats other people.  We finally get her attention and tell her of our reservation. She sits us at the worst seat in the whole restaurant. Right near her hostess podium! Right where people stand and wait.  This is a spacious restaurant. You would think celebrating two occasions would equal best seat available. Anyways, after abour 10 min a server takes our order of a bottle of wine.  30 min then pass and we never received our wine! I was so sad and disappointed.  So we left. We are not going to drop a $100 tab on an establishment who doesn't care about our business. So we hop on a community bike and ask them to take us to \"Valley Bar\" because it was near our concert we had tickets to. and everything else was packed.  The driver drops us off in an alley and we see what looks like a dive bar. We were so hungry so pressed for time so we said let's just try it. Omg! It was amazing. Underground, haunting, beautiful speak easy with a modern yet vintage feel. They treated us with the best service!! We ate like kings. Gorgeous charcuterie platters and we splurged and had bacon cheese fries. The cheese was so delicious and hand crafted. We split an amazing bottle of pinot noir and left so satisfied. We planned this trip around Luis work schedule and we were so happy to have a night to ourselves in Phoenix. Thank You, Valley Bar for the best experience ever! Can't wait to go back next time we are in Phoenix.",

However, this one had some good reviews and I was not feeling like walking too far.  I was glad that I stayed!  It was a lovely evening in downtown Phoenix and we sat outside in their small patio.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I thought the wine list was a little limited and pricey, but the menu was interesting and fairly broad.  My salmon was awesome, served hot and tasty.  Perfectly prepared.  Our other entree was one of their flatbreads.  It was larger than expected, nice crust, nice toppings.  Overall, a cut above.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a quick lunch this afternoon while on a work trip. This restaurant is located in the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Phoenix. The vibe is cool and the interior seems plush but still modern. They have a nice sized patio which is great if you want to sit outside- which I did. Their lunch menu isn't huge, but I'm honestly a fan of that - too many options becomes overwhelming. I opted for their harvest salad with chicken. I was impressed with this salad! It was a great portion size - not too huge but not tiny either. After eating, I was perfectly full. But the real star of this salad was all the yummy ingredients - mixed greens, quinoa, toasted nuts, dried cranberries, celery, avocado, sweet potato, manchego cheese + the chicken. The dressing was also a delicious and light champagne vinaigrette which I ordered on the side. The presentation of the salad in the bowl was also impressive. The only reason I'm docking a star here was for poor service and the fact that the patio is on a very busy sidewalk. Two different people walking down the street  interrupted my lunch asking me to take their picture. If I come back, I think I might eat inside next time.",

The warm caprese salad was something new and all ingredients were extremely fresh and the bread and cheese were all made in house. The kitchen was swamped from a conference that was in town so our wait time was a little delayed. We didn't really mind because the atmosphere there is very cool. However, Nick the manager wanted to comp the meal and offer deserts and more wine. We insisted on paying for the dinner but let him hook us up with the desert. The lemon cake with olive oil ice cream was decadent and light (all made in house as well). Anyone staying in town needs to find this Nook when you get the chance.",

No joke, this is some of the best food I've had. My server was very personable and helpful as well (thanks, Victoria!). I can only speak for what I had -- and all that I had was top notch.  1. Wood-Fired Olives. I thought maybe I'd get 8, but was impressed with probably 40 of these little yum-balls, soaking in a meltlicious puddle of seasoned butter. A generous portion of crostini accompanied them -- the perfect vehicle for soaking up the leftover butter.  2. Pizza Bianco - Funghi. I don't know how to describe this. It was delicious. The crust was maybe a little sweet, but I ate it right up.   3. Trapiche Malbec. Just yum.  This meal would have been perfect for two; I ate exactly half. I had the other half cold the next night. (Because, well, bachelor I guess.) STILL GOOD.",

    "text": "Finally!  The long vacant Professional Building in downtown Phoenix has new life. Once the home of Valley National Bank, in the current form this 1932 deco gem houses a Hilton Garden Inn and the subject of this review: Nook.  Whether you are visiting from near or far, Nook is one of the brightest spots downtown. Enter through the Hotel Lobby and you are reminded of a bygone era. One that is rarely seen in the Phoenix landscape. The hotel itself is great, but what Nook did in their corner is modern without losing the classic charm of the space, truly an exercise in class.   We were pressed for time, with a show at the Herberger. Our server Corey, was spot on. Once he knew our challenge, he helped us quickly (and under the happy hour wire!) choose items from the drink, bruschetta and pizza menus. He was efficient, friendly and quick to make sure Mom was taken care of first and foremost. (Dear Manager, he was GREAT).  Our choices:  *disclaimer, I referred to the menu to provide the ingredients.  :)  Fig jam, prosciutto, goat cheese and asparagus bruschetta. This was my personal favorite. The salty meat and sweet fig were a great pair. The addition of the asparagus and goat cheese kept the other tasty bits from overpowering and boring the pallet.   Short rib bruschetta (with mushroom duxelle, malbec demi-reduction and cotija cheese...) was another table favorite. Before heading to Nook, I read a couple reviews and one mentioned how great this was, we were not disappointed.    Our pizza was a bianco with prosciutto. Mozzerella, parmesan, olive oil and arugula. The crust was light and entirely edible... Literally to the the crust, which in my case is often left on the plate.   Though we were on a short time window, the close proximity to the theatre afforded us one more indulgence...   Affogato. This incarnation has a chocolate pudding with chocolate crumbles, lemon gelato and is of course topped with espresso. In our case, the manager delivered it to the table, exclaiming \"affogato!\" as he drowned the sweets in espresso. Well played Signore!  All were exceptional choices. I can hardly wait to try everything else!  While I hate to reveal this secret, I want it to become a downtown staple... So join me, in enjoying Nook.",

The mezcal cocktail was delicious as was the grilled salmon entree. Salmon slightly over cooked, but still delicious. The mashed cauliflower it came with rocked my world. Was hungover next day from mezcal cocktail (or maybe the red wine I had afterwards) but probably worth it. Would give overall 4.5 stars but can't give half stars on Yelp.",

We started out with the Shrimp Cocktail, super fresh, with a really excellent sauce, next we tried the Eggplant parm bruschetta, fabulous. We both ordered the Veal Osso Buco, huge, and fork tender! Nicolas suggested a wine, that was not on the wine list, it was outstanding, and not over priced. Dessert was also delicious! Next time we're in Phoenix, we'll be back!",

The menu was not limited but rather varied, all of us found something that sounded good. My wife had Chicken Marsala and I had the Rib Eye.  Both were very tasty and cooked exactly how we ordered.  Not one complaint from the other 18 people on the food or how it was served. The staff was on top of it and was very proficient.  They prepped us that the food would come out when finished and not how ordered.  This ensured every meal was hot and fresh.  While I thought the alcohol was a bit pricey ($11 for Moscow Mule), they did not cut a corner on amount of the pour.  I had the ooey gooey butter cream for dessert and my wife had the chocolate mouse cake.  Both where excellent and not mis proportioned.  The only complaint, if you want to call it a complaint, was the waiter was not very personable.  Professional, courteous and well organized, but just didn't interact well.  The bartenders were on it and kept drinks flowing as we arrived.  It appeared the manager, not sure because he didn't introduce himself, even came and verified that everything was prepared well and that overall, we were enjoying our selves.  I would recommend this place for a great night out.",

It's a short menu with many pizzas, some gluten free selections and a nice craft cocktail and wine menu. We weren't super hungry so we shared three plates, the meatball appetizer, poutine and the mushroom,  spinach, mozzarella pizza (gf). All items were tasty and well presented, but not outstanding in any way. Our waiter was attentive and informative and willing to engage in polite conversation.  He had great timing, when to stop and ask and when to walk by. I had a cocktail made with a Japanese whisky and my wife had another of the craft cocktails.  Both were excellent.  I would rate the drinks higher than the food. Reason, the smoothness and blending of the flavors. Been to many of the area bars attempting craft cocktails and I found these as good or better than all in presentation and flavor. I think this is a great spot, not outstanding,  but above average.  If you are going to an event at Symphony hall or the Herberger  (each a block away) give it a try for a light meal or stop by after for a cocktail.",

The owner Erica was very sweet and friendly and put a great vibe in the restaurant.  It was very clean and a great atmosphere.  Location was perfect just a couple blocks from Talking Sticks arena.",

We ordered 2 gluten free pizzas, and a Caesar salad..... the Caesar salad was not very good, it didn't have much flavor. The tomato was the best part of the salad. That being said. The food wasn't really good. Maybe if we had ordered something different it would have been better, but I don't think we will try this place again. The customer service is was great but that's it.",

    "text": "Visiting downtown phoenix, night out with the friends or looking for a lavish date night. You have to swing by Nook Kitchen to dine on some Pizza with Pizzaz. The elaborate restaurant is inside the Hilton Garden Inn. The swanky modern entrance is a small representation of the classy feel when you walk through the door.   My first time experience was an invite for a private party a few days ago during the early evening. I received a warm welcome from the Hostess and a man that I met later in the evening name Nick. The venue was not too pack but had a lively appeal.  Now if I could hire a designer to makeover my home I would hire the person who decorated this venue. It is AMAZING. The modern Italian look with cool vibes. The area where our party was had a unique setup. A large TV, plenty of seating, dim lighting and candles. Perfect area to hold that would hold a small group of friends while they enjoy themselves. The main area had tables perfectly positioned where you did not feel cramped and could enjoy your food. There was a large long table that with unique chairs that seem to be entertaining a business group who truly enjoyed themselves. The bar was defiantly entertaining. You can tell the bar has a nice night life. Lastly the patio area was beautiful. As the venue is located on the corner you get to watch the downtown life while you dine.  Now to the good stuff. The food and drinks! What I like about the menu it is not overwhelming. There is the perfect variety for all types of taste buds. Along with a pleasing drink menu.  Our group started off with a variety of appetizers. I did not eat them personally however, the table did and they gobbled them right up. We ordered Burchettas, The Classic Caprase and Beer Braised Pork Butt. We split the NEW WORLD MARGHERITA and the PROSCIUTTO. The pizza was not only fresh but extremely tasty. You can tell the kitchen uses fresh ingredients. Not one complaint from our large party. The service made the overall experience a pleasure to dine here as well.",

    "text": "Sadly, as I am a huge Arcadia Nook fan, I cannot give this location the 5 star rating I was totally expecting to give.  I am in love with the Wood Fired Olives appetizer here, we ordered that and it was totally on par with the Arcadia location.  My family ordered two pizza's the Giardino and the Margherita and said it was also on par with Arcadia and they looked great.      My order was the Cowboy Rib Eye.  I typically bounce back and forth between the Chicken Marsala and the Filet, and I tell everyone the Filet at Nook Arcadia is the best $27 filet you will ever eat.   They don't offer the Filet here so I went with their new Ribeye which is $34 and served over smashed Yukon Gold potatoes with four asparagus spears on the side.    Presentation and plating was beautiful... My mouth was watering... The ribeye was bone-in BUT it was full of fat and gristle, it was edible but I spent most of the time trying to cut around the gristle or pulling it out of my mouth. I don't mind fat in my steak I just prefer more to steak to fat, and not the tough gristle this steak had throughout.  The potatoes which were advertised as garlic parmesan were also bland and seem to be lack both garlic and parmesan. The asparagus was good.  This is not anything like the preparation or quality of the Filet at Arcadia and it was a 2 star dish for me for sure on the steak quality alone. I typically want to lick my plate at Nook but this wasn't the case the plate left the table with half a steak, lots of fat pieces and almost all the potatoes.    This location charges more for the same dishes, understandably they are in the hotel, it is bigger and they likely have more expenses, however I was a little surprised to see the same Chicken Marsala offered at Arcadia was $5 more here.    The valet parking is also expensive, $17 normally, $12 if you eat at the restaurant and get a stamp.  Find a parking spot if you can and don't valet, this isn't Nook's fault, just a tip.  If it weren't for the olives and pizza this would sadly be a 2 star review for me. Service was good.",

The entry in yelp had two dollar signs, I feel like this is quite incorrect. While the service was excellent, in my opinion the food was not worth the price. I ordered pizza that was average, nothing to write home about. Another person in my party ordered the short ribs entree which was cooked and presented nicely, but it was very bland. The staff tried to remedy this for us by bringing some au jus but it didn't help. Then the waiter brought us the appetizer version of the short ribs which was better.  Takeaway: amazing service, average pricey food.",

Even better, if you have an event to attend at either Comerica Theater or Talking Stick Resort, you can valet park your car right out front for $12 (they're attached to the Hilton Garden Inn), then dine and walk to your event. So easy! First off, we were greeted with warm friendly smiles and seated and served right away. The food, incredible...the personal size pizzas were generous in size and delicious, but...the crust is the real stand out here! I'll go so far as to say the best pizza I've ever had (see photos). The martinis were smooth, the Espresso perfect, and home-made Limoncello not to be missed. Bravo Nook Kitchen!!!",

    "text": "I tried this place for the first time in downtown Phoenix tonight because the hotel I was staying at didn't have quite the tempting menu with both gluten and gluten free options.    Upon arrival, I got an immediate seat for 1 at the bar (Tuesday at 7:30 pm). The ambience at the bar, the decor and the restaurant are really nice- all the light fixtures are awesome! It's smaller than I had anticipated (I like that) but found it to be perfectly quaint and cozy.   James, the bartender, knew how to make a delicious slightly dirty Tito's martini (always a plus in my book after a long workday). I asked for food suggestions and he recommended the beef short ribs, served with braised leek mashed potatoes and green beans. I didn't know it came with green beans so I ordered a side of asparagus too (I am a huge veggie fan!). I'm gluten free and ate everything I ordered because it was absolutely delicious. I could blame it on not eating lunch but the food was really just that great!   The owner, Frank, is very personable and checked on me several times throughout the meal, which I thought was very impressive. Having worked in the restaurant business for years, I appreciate it when the owners take the time to visit with the patrons. He was genuinely concerned about my feedback on the meal and even had suggestions for next time I visited (ribeye, lamb shank and gluten free pizza). He recommend I end with a dessert, the affogato, which was an amazingly delicious and unique Italian treat. Normally Im not a dessert eater but this was so unique I had to try it. I certainly recommend it!  Phoenix is in my territory for work and I will definitely come back as there are other entrees on the menu that I want to try. You, too, should give this place a shot! You won't regret it!",

My wife couldn't eat any of them (all dairy based). I decided on the \"ooey gooey mess\". It was a \"butter cake\" with ice cream and some kind of \"swoop\" of something I couldn't figure out the flavor of. It was over $10 and really wasn't worth it. The cake had some kind of crust that was so hard I needed a sharp knife to cut it. There was no flavor to any of it and I regret ever going there. They had a full menu, but it was a bar... really. Don't go there. Eat before you go to the hotel. The hotel was nice. Eat before you get there!",

We were greeted promptly and chose a table near the window to look at the grey afternoon. Mom and I had just seen Ballet Arizona's performance of the Nutcracker and were in the mood for some quick lunch before we went Christmas shopping. Our server was cute and fun and provided a great experience for us. We started with the poutine- and folks you really got to spring for the fried egg on top. Adds such a delicious flavor throughout the dish. I had to literally push the plate away from me otherwise I would have eaten the entire thing and licked the plate. The gravy and cheese curds are so deliciously bad!   I repented by ordering the Harvest Quinoa salad. The presentation was beautiful and mixing all the ingredients together with that delicious dressing was really a home run. We also got two pizzas to take with us I ordered the Funghi with sausage and my mom ordered the Quattro Fromaggio. I love the thin flakey crust and the flavors are so evenly distributed, making every bite a winner.  Can't forget my cocktail! I ordered the Sultry Sage (or something like that) and it was sweet and strong and perfectly foamy from the egg whites!",

They have a happy hour from 4-6 that includes drink specials ($5 titos vodka drinks which are normally $9! Also beer and wine deals) and $3 off pizzas, bruschettas, salads, starters. We sat at the bar and had awesome service from the guy bartender (we forgot to catch his name!). The manager also chatted with us. For food we had the porco y fungi pizza and it was SO good! Thin crispy crust and simple, fresh toppings  = our favorite kind of pizza.   We had such a good experience we actually went again on Saturday evening after having sub par service at a different restaurant. Had a few drinks and tried the fig jam bruschetta - fig jam, goat cheese, asparagus - unique and delicious! The same bartender and the manager were there and remembered us. Awesome food, drinks, and service plus good happy hour deals - I'd definitely recommend Nook!",

Impressive and gorgeous place.  We wanted something lite so shared the chicken artichoke brushettas. It came with 4 pieces. They were piled with chunky pieces of grilled chicken, spinach, roasted garlic ricotta, and artichokes. It was incredibly satisfying for a little plate.   Two servers took care of us. Drinks were always replenished.   The neighborhood can still be a little scary depending on the time and day. I'll probably return to the Arcadia location more often since it's no parking fee. Another great option to downtown PHX area though.",

We sat in the area away fro the bar and it was quite cozy. The service was good from the start and our waitress was very helpful.  The food was outstanding. My wfie had the salmon and i had the chicken marsala.  The marsala was very flavorful, and the pasta was fresh.  The salmon was crusty on the outside and still tender and moist on the inside. We finished wirh the buttercake and it was one of the best desserts i have had. We will be going back to Nook in the future.",

We ordered the grilled olives, drinks, and pizza. 40 plus minutes in, no olives ( we asked twice, the 2 people who sat down AFTER we did ordered the olives and were done with theirs before we finally received them). The pizza finally arrived ( I did not know until after we left that we actually received a pizza we did not order, I left the decision up to my dining companion) and it was quite late, as we were going to a show and were on a time limit, even though we allowed 90 minutes to dine and get to the show. Once we saw the \"bartendress\" climb up on top the cooler behind the bar right in front of stacks of glasses with her most likely very dirty shoes, betting this  would not go over well with the Health Department. They did comp my second glass of wine, but we won't be returning to either location. The olives are great but NOT that great.",

One of the best valentine days ever and it was definitely because of this restaurant. Also it is in a great location with lots of pretty hotels nearby to look at, and a lot of places to park. We will definitely be returning here again. Amazing service and even more amazing food!",

I had a salmon salad and it was absolutely awesome - tons of different veggies, nuts, seeds and a lovely piece of salmon on top.  My husband had the short ribs with mashed potatoes and he said it was tender and very flavorful.  The wine list was excellent and the service was even better.  DEFINATELY will go again.",

Comfortable seating abound with lots of spots to get a little privacy while on a date or good bar area if you want to mix it up a a bit.  The lighting in this place is exceptional.  Cool wall sconces and hanging chandeliers are very interesting just adding to the upscale feel.    Everyone is super friendly and the tenders made some great drinks.  They had Tower Station IPA from Mother Road Brewing in Flag which was the first time I've seen that brew make it down to these parts.  Mixed drinks were strong and well mixed.  The food was good but not exceptional.  We had a Charcuterie board which we were a little disappointed in.  Mostly because the cheeses we very average and not very imaginative.  It seems Phoenix is still afraid of softer stinky cheeses that I just go wild for.  The meats on the board however were exceptional.  I think the meat guy needs to talk to the cheese guy!  :)  The rest of the menu was interesting with something for everyone.  We also chose from a variety of Bruchetta and some of them were quite good like the Fig and Goat cheese.  Bathrooms were a bit of a walk out to the connected hotel lobby.  Regardless they were clean and well maintained.  Parking is a bit of a jam but hey you are in DT phoenix so just grab a garage spot and suck it up.  I think we ended up paying $14 for the full night after dinner and show which is not too bad.",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday evening for drinks and dessert. Ordered \"Salted Caramel Pumpkin Bread Pudding\" supposedly \"served warm with bourbon praline sauce, candied spice pepitas, and cinnamon ice cream.\" The bartender brought a piece of dried-out lemon cake plated with some toffee on the side--a strange combination. I said, we ordered the bread pudding. He said, yeah, that's the bread pudding. We didn't know what to say. Then I looked on the menu and lemon cake isn't even offered. If you're out of a dessert, say so, but don't embarrass guests into eating something they didn't order.",

    "text": "Nook is the place to go and hang out and eat delicious and when i mean DELICIOUS, the food is Delicious on so many levels! But let's start from the beginning, when you walk in the hostess welcomes you with a smile so pleasant, sits you down and for the first couple of minutes you just stare at all the amazing architectural of this resturant, which is vintage,yet modern. Our Server Jason welcomes you and hands you the menu and asks if you have any questions. Looking at the menu is very easy to see why this is their second location. The food was  spectacular.  I ordered the Monroe Burger, really didn't know what to expect, since it was my first time. But when it came out our whole table reacted in \"OMG that's a huge burger\". I was stunned! The Monroe Burger was more than i had expected in a burger, soooooo many flavors, so many textures, it really took me on a culinary experience all in one bite!! Nook is the only place that i have been to that a burger takes me on a culinary mouth-watery adventure. And will highly recommend it to anyone! So do yourself and your stomach a favor and go try this amazing place. And on top of that the people make you feel at home, just in a fancier/yet casual way and you are supporting a great local business!!  Thank you Nook for a WONDERFUL experience!  Surely will go again!!",

Some delicious cocktails too, I like the Rhubarb and Rye very much.   A good location for events downtown,  but a good night out in its own right.  Very close to the light rail for the park'n'riders too.",

My husband and I shared the calabrese pizza and grilled romaine salad with a pinot noir.  We sat at the bar, the food was delicious and it was a lot of fun.  It's so great to see successful restaurants in downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "I went to Nook Kitchen as it is close to my Office and opened quickly - it is going through a soft Opening and here is my review;  SERVICE - Excellent Service from the staff (Hostess, Servers, Bartenders, etc.) Prompt, courteous and offered suggestions  DECOR - Great Decor -  interior of restaurant is very nice.  Funny thing is the builders did not realize they put doors that open OUT towards the patio and placed a table right in front of one of the doors - maybe a slider would have been a better idea!  Also figure a door would have been placed by the corner as you need to enter the Hotel to get to the Restaurant - Hotel Lobby is Extremely Nice!  FOOD - Found the food to be okay - here is what I ordered;  1. Shrimp Coktail - Shrimp themselves were very Good, but the Cocktail Sauce had too much Lemon in it - considering it was served with two Lemon Wedges, I would have preferred to add my own instead of tasting mainly lemon - also prefer a little more heat - was nearly no spice at all.  2. Beer Braised Pork Butt Bruschetta (Half Order) - I wanted to order one of the Bruschetta choices and the Server recommended this one so I went with it.  The pork itself was Great, but the bread it was on was Mush/soft.  It literally tasted like I was eating an open faced sandwich on white bread - maybe this is part of the learning process, but the bread in a Bruschetta should be crispy!   3. Meatball Sandwich with French Fries - Meatballs were very Good - Real Deal Cheese and Bread was similar to a Pita which I liked - disappointment here is the minimal amount of Sauce that was involved in the sandwich  PRICE - Total came to $41.00 without Tip - I had 5 Shrimp, Half order (2 pieces) of Bruschetta and a Meatball Sandwich with French Fries and an Unsweetened Tea.  It is a new place and normally I would not order Shrimp Cocktail, Bruschetta and a sandwich, but I wanted to try various options - I will try some other sandwiches and salads in the next months, but I am not rushing back to try them - the meal was okay and is Pricey for Lunch",
