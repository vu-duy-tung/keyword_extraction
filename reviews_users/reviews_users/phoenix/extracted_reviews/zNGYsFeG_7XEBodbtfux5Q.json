This place is family owned and operated. The meat and bread are good but the rice is not. It tastes weird. Also your meal does not come with pita bread or hummus. They have no middle eastern sodas or gourmet sodas, just Pepsi products. The Mother who is the cook is the only nice person there. The younger boys will treat you funny if you are not middle eastern. And don't expect a damn thing from the younger women working there. I don't feel to much racial tension here vs other places. But as an African women I do know they can be more respectful. The Baklava was soggy this time.",

If you like authentic afghan style food I would highly recommend this place. The prices are reasonable and every curry comes with 4 pieces of naan . I and my husband like panner tikka masala it is our fav dish here. Recently we visited this restaurant again and thought to try samosas as appetizer for the first time but unfortunately it was horrible. It dint really look like samosa and stuffing was very less and not at all tasty so 4 star is for panner tikka and naan.",

    "text": "Santi and I discovered this Afghan restaurant on Yelp and came to visit on several occasions. The horizontal interior was equip with a front counter, overhead menu, good number of tables, moderate lighting, and maps and images of Afghanistan. The atmosphere can be sparse, but still home-like based on previous visits.  The Uzbek Pulaw ($13.99) encompassed one skewer of lamb cubes, cucumber salad, and Afghan rice. The lamb was tasty and nicely seasoned, but was also too small when measured against the Chicken Boti. As a national dish, the Afghan rice came with bits of lamb, shredded carrots, and raisins buried into the rice mixture. We unexpectedly found lamb innards due to its metallic flavor, and the brothy sauce that was used for seasoning had an off-putting profile. Portions were generous, but comparatively, the Chicken Boti was the better choice.  The Chicken Karahi ($12.99) arrived with half of a chicken served in a ginger, jalapeno, tomato sauce, and our choice of Tandoori Chili Naan. The combination of dark and white meat was tender and sensational. The cooked-down flavors of ginger and jalapeno provided the spiciness, and the tomato sauce helped round out the sharp edges. Serving was plentiful. We wished the dish came with more heat and sauce for the rice, but this was our favorite dish at this restaurant.  The Lamb Shank ($12.99) came with one large bulky piece of lamb shank, cucumber salad, and Afghan rice. The lamb was easy to fork off the bones, but there was little seasoning to alter the gaminess. Unlike other Afghan restaurants, the profile of their rice carried a strange oily aftertaste. The cucumber salad was served in room temperature and tasted more like a filler than anything else.  The Chicken Boti ($9.99) came with one skewer of chicken breast marinated with spices. The chicken skewer was sizable, tender, delicious, and nicely seasoned. The sides of cilantro and yogurt sauces were delicious. Interested diners should note that the regular basmati rice was the better option when compared to the Afghan rice that tend to overwhelm the flavor of the skewers.   The Tandoori Chili Naan ($2.99) came with large pieces covered with cilantro and jalapeno. The spicy tandoori flavors were captivating to couple with the delightful thick and crispy textures. There was a resounding crunch in every bite.   The location in the strip mall provided ample parking. Interested diners should expect large portions, reasonable prices, home-like atmosphere, and down-to-earth customer service. Despite shortcomings, there are still plenty to look forward to on their menu. I would be  returning to try the Goat Karachi, Paneer Tikka Masala, Eggplant, Cauliflower, Okra, and Garlic Naan.",

Sometimes I go there at dinner time with my friends as well. We order combo plate and Beef Nihari are great. I would suggest you to try it.   The other beautiful food in this place is NAN. I just can eat that NAN as alone. It's just bread but so tasty.   The place is pretty clean, dishes are clean. Prices are reasonable. You can eat fulfilling lunch under $10. The staff is all relatives of the owner and they are so kind. I like this family business and I will support them.",

    "text": "Even if Afghan food is not in your general comfort zone, you really should give Khyber Halal a chance.  Small ethnic restaurants are not always attractive, comfortable, or even clean, but Khyber excels in all of these areas.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  The menu is varied but not so large as to make you suspicious about how much frozen food is served - I believe everything here is freshly prepared.  The portions are large, the prices are low, and the food is nearly as good as it gets for this type of establishment.  So how could Khyber be better?: Well, I wish they were located in my neighborhood, and the food could be spiced a little more heavily, particularly as regards salt.  Other than that ... well I gave it five stars.  I can particularly recommend the Mantoo, a kind of ravioli dish with meat-stuffed dumplings in a surprisingly good beef-yogurt sauce.  The \"Salad\" (for under $2) is a large portion of a cucumber-tomato-onion chopped salad, and is a perfect relish for the Mantoo.  There are a number of vegitarian dishes served with Nan.  We had the Bamya (okra) which needed salt but was otherwise perfectly prepared.  The Nan here is thick, like a thick-crust pizza, and they give you enough to make a meal of on its own.  If you have room for dessert, I can recommend the Phirni - a pudding whose ingredients we were told are secret, but it tastes like a cross between rice pudding and custard and is superb.  I have to return to try the kebabs and some of the other specialties.  The pictures on the menu and the website are helpful and accurate, so you really know what you are getting.  Maybe I shouldn't raise your expectations too much only to have you disappointed.  See for yourself.  What are you risking? -- For two people, we had two delicious somasas for an appetiser, two main courses, a huge plate of Afghan rice, a side salad, and a dessert for $33 including tax and tip.  I've paid much more for much less.",

A tiny hole in the wall usually turns out to be the best place to go and this one did not disappoint! We practically took up the whole place but that didn't hinder the service. I tried the Gulpi a Cauliflower dish cooked with a unique blend of spice and seasonings, I'm no vegan but it was the perfect meal for me. But just to get some variety I ordered a chicken samosa, like an empanada but different texture to the dough, another winner! Along with some tips about <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarmersonly.com&s=39eae4562a55f6a1a4c7b861617aa07fe9dbbec213263870d1d0089f507af859\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">farmersonly.com</a> fellow yelpers Jennifer and Eirich shared a few tasty bites of their Mantoo dish. It reminded me of beef ravioli, swimming in tomato and drizzled with yogurt sauce. Everything was good, the portions were large and the prices are low!

    "text": "I really, really enjoyed the experience of meeting up with the Phoenix ISC at this place.  It is truly a hole-in-the-wall but they handled our crowd pretty well.  I would have to guess that they have a hard time when faced with large parties but everything came out at roughly the same time and my food was hot when it arrived.  My favorite bite of the night actually came from the Yelper seated across the table from me.  She ordered the mantoo and graciously traded bites with me for some of my kabli pulao.  The mantoo consists of bite and a half sized ground beef and onion dumplings with a meat sauce and a yogurt sauce on top.  I really, really liked the combination of flavors and the presentation was simple yet beautiful.  I would have gladly eaten an entire order!  My entree was a ground beef kebab that was over a foot long and beautifully seared with a really pronounced charcoal flavor.  It came on a bed of Afghani rice which included raisins and carrots.  Savory and well seasoned, it completed the dish.  That said, the beef was a little dry and benefited from the occasional dunking in the yogurt sauce.  I also had a beef samosa that was a steal for a buck.  It came with a sauce that included jalapenos so I had to leave that part of the dish alone.  The others at the table who sampled it had great things to say, including the description of it tasting green.  Plenty of green ingredients and it looked like something I would have enjoyed if it didn't include the one green ingredient I cannot eat.  The samosa itself was just about perfect.  I really liked the addition of several different peppers in the meat mixture both for the flavors they added and the color.  They were fried perfectly and were the right balance between tender and crunchy.  Baklava for dessert, iced tea to drink plus a generous tip and I was still out the door for less than $20.  Thanks again Phoenix for having me at your ISC.  It was a pleasure to meet everyone and I enjoyed the restaurant!",

Everything on the menu looked good, and maybe I should have read more reviews, because I ordered way too much. The husband and I shared the chicken tikka masala (spicy), a beef samosa, the beef dumplings, and a side of rice with carrots and raisins. If you have been here you know this is an obscene amount of food... I did not know that and was shocked when the plates came out. Let's start with the good:  The samosa was delicious and the cilantro sauce that came with it was amazing... delicious with a touch of spiciness.   The service was fabulous... attentive and timely for such a large group.  The dumplings were really yummy and different than anything I have ever tasted. Plus there were like 10 of them on the plate.... they were tasty. I would get them again for sure.   The bread was fresh, warm, and delicious.... oh, and plentiful.   The prices- this place was inexpensive... I could have fed 6 people for 30$  Ok, now for the bad:  The chicken tikka masala came out completely not spicy.... maybe they didn't hear me, or something got lost in the large order, but it was not at all spicy and just tasted kind of boring.... The portion was large, but if the flavor is there, it really doesn't matter.   The side of rice was maybe the worst thing I got. It was huge and tasted.... off. It's hard to describe, but it tasted like oil that has been used one too many times.... just kind of weird. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste, but if it is... yikes.... not awesome.   Anyway, I would like to come back here without the large group to taste this food as it's meant to be.",

Feels like u r experiencing the eastern culture. The food is better than most Indian/Pakistani restaurants. If you want some real authentic food go for a nihari and the combo platter. Don't choose typical Pakistani stuff like biryani, karahi, wraps etc bcoz this is not the place. Afghani food however is delicious. Went there quite a few times only for nihari. It's a family owned business and we support them for this. The young guy who's on reception is so nice to talk with. My only reservation is that if u r just couple of minutes late from 8.00 pm they won't seat you even they close at 9.00pm and leave right away at 9.00 if you are late for pick up. One day we arrived at 9.03 pm and they were literally out with our order which they handed us on road. They don't even care for their regular customers. They won't listen n understand your problem. They must have to raise their standard for good customer service otherwise there are many other better places.",

Be sure to try some of the Afghani dishes too, like the Mantoo, which is kind of like a spicy ravioli with a twist of yogurt.  I have never had a bad tasting dish here and tried a lot of things, my only complaint and thing that would keep me from rating this 5 stars is the fact that I have received cold food on a couple of occasions and on a couple of occasions my simosas were partially frozen in the middle.",

    "text": "We live just down the road and having seen this place for over two years we decided to finally get some takeout there. The menu is very interesting it's not your average Afghani kebab place it's more traditional food we decided instead of ordering dinners to just order a la cart off the menu which you can do. We ordered chicken kebab, lamb, Cream spinach, cauliflower, A third vegetable dish which I can't recall and some pita. The food was all very well prepared and tasted good. The vegetable dishes come out very soft so if you're looking for al dente cooked veg this is not the restaurant for you however you can also get salads. It took a fair amount of time to put ours together as I walked in off the street so I would recommend calling ahead. All-around we really did enjoy the food and would likely get take out there again you can eat in but we prefer to take out on weekdays and if we go out to restaurants on weekends we probably go somewhere else with a little more ambience. But if you're into afghani food you should definitely give this place a try.",

I have been to this place twice in 2 weeks!  The menu is huge, I don't know what half of the stuff on there is but that is what google is for. I've tried at least 3 things now that I have never had before and they were all delicious.  The chicken Handi is addictive, it's what I went back for. The servings are family style in my opinion, but it did not stop me from ordering 4 things! I had leftovers which tasted even better the next day.  I'm a sucker for family owned restaurants, these meals are home cooked recipes to order so the wait is a little longer, but well worth it. If you just get off work and don't want to wait, they do take out. Order before you leave and it's ready to pick up...this is me planning my next visit.",

I always enjoy north Indian food and found a dish I recognized. The chicken tikka was great but I ordered it a level of spice I couldn't handle. The sauce was so good but my mouth was on fire. I tried to reheat with yogurt but it didnt bring it down to doable. Cant blame them for my mistake! . The other dish I ordered was the was the Beef Nihari. I have heard of this dish from other Indians middle easterners but never tried. This sauce on the other hand was not something I could enjoy. The description sounded amazing and it was indicated as being one of the most popular. I feel like the dish a very distinct buttery masala taste but not very spicy or taste of many different spices. Another time I did the lunch special of Gyro and fries which was great. Finished it off with some baklava that was also on point.",

The naan s not like the naan you'll get as an indian restaurant, but its still good, more crispy. We ordered the afghani kofta and mixed grill platter. I was a little worried about ordering the kofta because the grill platter is HUGE!. But after trying the kofta, I was glad I ordered it...juicy meatballs surrounded by well cooked and seasoned lentil curry. The meat from the grill is cooked well, not too dry. Sadly did not have room for baklava or any other dessert, but we did leave with a lot of leftovers. It's also at a good price point so they definitely have gained a repeat customer.",

The beef and lamb were okay, nothing remarkable. The platter came with rice, salad (similar to pico de gallo) and yogurt sauce.   The platter was huge, enough food for 3-4 people, so we definitely had leftovers to take home. At $24.99, it was a great value for what you get.

I like it because the food is sooo good and I like value.  I still can't get over how 15 people ate here family style for only $10 each INCLUDING TAX AND TIP for large group, we paid $150 total.    I later hosted my own MeetUp dinner here, ordered family style which I pre-selected with the owner, Fahima, for 22 people.   Some of the dishes Fahima and I selected for my group are Mixed Grill Meat Platter (Usbek Puloa, Kofta, chicken kabob), Goat Khari, Mantoo (meat dumplings topped with yogurt sauce), Gulpi (cauliflower stew), Badanjan (eggplant, oh I love eggplant),  Tandori Garlic and Paratha Naan, cucumber salad (comes with entrees), and Afghani rice flavored with cardamom seed (comes with entrees), and we each got one Beef Samosa.   We were served immediately upon arrival with hot dishes, and great service from her sons.  Because I ordered more goat and lamb dishes, our bill still came out to less than $13 a person. including tax and tip.  I never order chicken anywhere, because 90% of restaurants cook it dry and hard, but someone else did and I tasted it.  The grilled chicken was very tender and charbroiled flavor, best chicken I ever had in my life!    After I hosted my dinner here, several people told me they come back here again and again, and thank me for introducing Khyber Halal to them.",

The Phoenix Supper Club UYE visited Khyber Halal in January.  I was out of town on business, but I stopped in last month to sample a few things and I was very pleased with the offerings.    The most moist and tenderly seasoned  lamb!   Practically melts in your mouth.   Large portion.   Get the kabob with rice and order a specialty naan on the side.   Fluffy tender rice with a strong cumin flavor laced in every bite.  I don't usually eat much rice, but the house rice was a delicious treat.. The Lamb came with a Cucumber tomato onion and cilantro mixed salad.   I also ordered the Garlic naan.  nom nom nom.... The bread was perfectly tender with a lite crunch and bursting with the flavors of roasted and fresh garlic.  Deliciously spiced beef.   Reminds me more if a Jamaican beef patty,  spicier and more flavorful.   The chicken samosa is just as yummy,  but lacks the bold flavors of the beef.   Rather spicy for most Americans.  BTW: Halal means \"permitted by law\" in Arabic.  Halal food follows the laws for dietary needs described in the Islamic faith... humane slaughter of animals, no pork or pork by products, no animals without external ears and so forth.",

If you don't know what you want to order, ask the waitstaff for recommendations or bring friends who have visited before (which is what I did).  I had the eggplant from the Afghani Specialty menu with naan, and it was delicious but too much food, which was actually OK because I just boxed up the leftovers in a doggie bag (even if I had a dog, I wouldn't share). I also ordered a veggie samosa, which I had one yummy bite, exclaimed how good it was, and it was finished off in \"taste testing\" by my dinner mates.   The naan was really useful, especially at soaking up some of the hot spices in the other dishes that my group ordered.  I'd like to try other items on the menu too, as they have a diverse assortment including gyros! Looking forward to visiting again.",

The menu is chock full of interesting Afghani dishes. The dish I ordered contained a whole chicken. Needless to say, I took some home with me. My dish would have fed a family of four easily. The naan that accompanied the dish was unbelievable. It tasted like manna from heaven. The four of us polished off most of what we ordered and we left full and happy.

The Atlantic ran an article a few months ago talking about how to properly pick an ethnic restaurant.  You're supposed to find a little hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall where there are no laughing pretty people sitting outside.  Khyber Halal definitely fits criteria, as it's parked in a strip mall on 24th street in the ghetto zone.  Despite the authenticity, however, portion sizes are definitely American.  You get both quality and quantity for your buck here, and you don't need to use too many of those bucks to fill up.  I've had the Mantoo both times, which are kind of like meat-filled dumplings with spaghetti-like sauce on top.  They're super tasty.  I also have tried the chicken boti, which comes with a spicy sauce.  Definitely try the Chai tea while you're here.  It's an authentic Chai (read: not a sugar-filled chain coffee drink) and is perfectly smooth.  The mango lassi was also a hit.  I haven't tried any of the curries yet (they have goat!) but plan to the next time I come back, which will be very soon.",

I find myself obessed with their Chicken Kahari.  It is just so freaking good.  It's like crack. So many complex flavors that I just can't comprehend.  It's under the curry section of their menu, but don't expect the typical creamy coconut based curry that we all know.  It's actually like a puree of tomatoes and a bunch of other awesome shit.  I know I'm not doing this dish justice at all so I'm gonna stop here, but please believe me when I say that you MUST try this dish. ( Get it SPICY)  I also like their Chicken Tika Masala.  It's similar to the Indian version, cubes of chicken breast immersed in delicious sauce, but again, this version is NOT creamy.  It's very dense in spices.  Oh and each entree comes with a huge naan (bread) the size of your face x 2.  And their portions are HUGE.   Service is very friendly and efficient.

Also, I love eating vegetarian as much as possible. When I'm craving the good stuff and am willing to sacrifice innocent animals for the purpose, I go for the goat biryani. Guessing by how frequently the place is packed with people, these dishes are perfectly representative. I also recommend the hummus appetizer if you're looking for some tasty to go with your numnum.  The big warning to take in if you go to this place is that if you aren't a leftovers person or won't be able to pack leftovers, you should really plan on sharing a meal. I tend to go here and eat until it hurts and still have enough for lunch the next day. I like to go and split an appetizer and plate with a friend, and I always leave more than full.  Last note, the service here is wonderful. The owners run the shop themselves and are very friendly and appreciative of your business. They get busy, so it might take a moment or a friendly ask, but the staff is so responsive. If you love experiencing the world's cuisines and have some time in Phoenix, I would highly recommend Khyber Halal.",

The Chicken & Paneer Tikka Marsala is beyond delicious, some of the best in town in my opinion. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Samosas beef, chicken, & veggie all spectacular! Everything is homemade, and you can tell with every bite you take it's made with a lot of love. Service is always perfect. The family that owns/runs the business are always super kind and welcoming. You can't beat this restaurant.",

    "text": "After being stuck in the rural Midwest for two years where food options were extremely limited, this place was a nice find for lunch.    Glad to have my Pakistani/Indian Yelpie friend present to order as I had no idea what to do.  We got chicken karahi, goat biryani, chicken tikka masala, and chickpeas with some naan to share.  Food came out looking looking very homey and overall tasted very good.   The karahi was by far the best - very tender and moist chicken that I mopped up with naan.  Tikka Masala was also tasty and had a nice kick (you can adjust spice levels).  The rice:goat ratio on the biryani was high and while I usually like goat, this was a bit gamey and dry.   Service was slow given there weren't many other diners at the restaurant.  However, portions were huge and very reasonably priced.  Total bill was $44 for 4  and we left stuffed with 4 full boxes of leftovers.   I would come back for more karahi and to try some other dishes. Probably for dinner though as the food is pretty heavy for lunch.",

And when I order that take-out, let's be honest, I will probably have to order that delicious Mantoo concoction as an \"appetizer\" even though I will be dining alone. I'm really glad that someone made a parody of Taylor Swift's 22 for 30-somethings, because now I don't have to feel bad about choosing take-out over a night on the town. You know, some of us have jobs and responsibilities and just don't want to put on spanx at the end of the day. We want to put on yoga pants and eat Chinese food ... or in this case Afghani.   So, in conclusion, if you are looking for some tasty meat, why not try Khyber Halal? It's available whenever a craving strikes and you don't have to get dressed up for it.",

So we ordered some goat biryani ,chicken malai boti , with some chicken karahi for a to-go (initially our plan is to dine-in ,but changed up our mind as it is empty).  Staff are prompt and placed the order and asked us to wait for 15-20 mins. The food is packed very clean and leak safe. Also it is fresh. When it comes to taste, I did not find the boti and karahi that good. They tasted like under seasoned. However the biryani is better in taste.  Over all my experience is for a one time go.",

Very ample portions with more than enough for a take home meal. The chicken is bone-in and served in a calderon with plenty of Naan bread. Great flavor also with some heat. Service was very good. It is located in a strip mall with ample parking. Great custom and antique VW shop next door for car buffs.

Once we had a chance to review the menus, our orders were taken and the food came out quickly. First, we ordered one chicken and one veggie (potato) samosa. Yum!! They were golden brown and the dipping sauce that comes with them is the perfect compliment to the flaky pastries. Next, came the chicken boti and the mantoo. The chicken boti is a classic seasoned chicken kabob and we upgraded to the Afghani rice, served with carrots and raisins. We were pleasantly surprised by how delicious the rice is and it really stood on its own! And now to the mantoo. These Afghani dumplings are filled with ground beef and topped with a beef sauce and garnished with mint. DO NOT miss your chance to try these! You will not regret it. The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable. This was our first visit and will not be our last. We can't wait to visit again!",

With 1hr and 10mins to closing and a $20 cab ride the 4of us entered with great anticipation. No greeting, no smile, no eye contact even. The first words spoken to us upon entering the door were, \"takeout only.\" I said, \"pardon me\"? And the response came back even more dry, \"takeout only.\" When I mentioned we have arrived with ample time to be seated, the guy made eye contact, raised his voice and said in a firm voice, \"TAKEOUT ONLY.\"  Informed him that we are from out of town staying at a hotel and cannot do takeout he said not his problem.  Asked why takeout only, he said they've run out of some items on the menu. That is understandable so I decided to reason with a compromise. I asked to let us order from what remains on the menu so we can be seated. Surely a win-win I thought. This guy just didn't care. He said no matter what we order he would tell us he was out. And in the next breath said, takeout only. Asked for a manager, one wasn't available.  Got his name, Abdullah.  Abdullah does not care for his customers, nor did he seem to be concerned about how rude and unprofessional he was being. He used words like that's not my problem and I don't care. He is ill prepared to serve in this role in the food service industry. Perhaps he is an inexperienced employee or a family member. Neither excuses the poor service and the awful attitude displayed. He is representing Khyber Halal in the worst way possible and to the detriment of the owners.  I was humiliated in front if my colleagues. I have never been spoken to in such an arrogant and condescending manner. Had to leave. Spent an extra $80 in cab fare to Tempe and back to dine at Curry Corner (highly recommended).  Will never return to Khyber Halal. Take your business elsewhere. Many other restaurants that will make you feel welcome and demonstrate care.",

    "text": "Sweet mother of God, why haven't I tried this place sooner??? I've wasted 24 years I could have been savoring their dishes. (I technically don't know how long they've been in business, but I'm guessing it's been a while... and even if it's a month... I can't believe I've missed that month).  It might be my new favorite restaurant in this city.  The food was amazing.  The service was wonderful.  The value was outstanding. The prices are beyond reasonable for what you get (taking into account both flavor and portion size).  Don't let the location scare you.  Consider it a blessing.  It's probably how they keep prices down.   I ordered the Chicken Karahi (large portion, so that I'd have leftovers for lunch the next day).  It's a miraculous mixture of chicken perfectly cooked, in a ginger/jalapeno/tomato based sauce that's so delicious and fragrant, served with naan bread.  I ordered it medium hot, and the spices were perfect.  Definitely warm, but not so hot you can't enjoy your food. It's only 10am next day, and I've already broken into the take-home carton and had it for breakfast.  YUM.  Even better second day, if that's possible.   My hubby ordered the Mantoo.  HEAVEN.  He cleaned his entire plate off (and then helped himself to my Karahi...which at the time I was cool with... but today.. I wish I'd have told him to keep his grubby hands to himself... I would have had enough left for breakfast AND lunch.)  We were stuffed, but had to try the Gulub Jaman for dessert.  We weren't disappointed.  Two balls of doughy goodness, resting in a sweet syrup of heaven.  They aren't large.  Small actually.  The perfect amount to cap off an amazing meal with, without pushing you over gluttony's precarious edge.    Don't hesitate to give this place a shot. You will be so glad you did.   BRAVO Khyber Halal!!  You will definitely be seeing us again!!!!",

    "text": "Mediterranean cuisine is one of my favorites, so I was really looking forward to a great meal from Khyber Halal. I really wanted to like this place, based on all my fellow Yelpers' reviews, but, in my opinion, it just wasn't up to snuff.   I checked them out on a Friday night after work, looking to grab a few items to go. After entering the hole-in-the-wall location (which I love, by the way), I was greeted from behind the counter by an older gentlemen and a few teenagers. You could tell this was truly a family run operation.  After perusing the menu for a bit, I asked for a few recommendations. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, so I told them to throw the best of the bunch at me. He suggested the Uzbak Pulao, which was grilled lamb on top of a rice mixture (carrots, currants, and bits of meat...I'm assuming it was lamb or goat). My husband ordered the Chicken Handi, which was grilled chicken with a spicy rub over rice (nothing fancy here).  We also ordered Naan and a side of hummus.  We got home and dove into our meals, which by the way, was enough to feed a family of four, if not six. My lamb was chewy (I ordered it medium rare) with very little flavor, and the rice mixture was bland and oily (probably from all the meat). The Naan had no flavor at all, either, and after a certain point, I felt like I was eating a chewy piece of cardboard. By far the worst of the bunch was the hummus. It was literally mashed up chickpeas with no additional ingredients (tahini, anyone? Maybe a little lemon juice?). It was bland as can be.  To be fair, my husband enjoyed his chicken, but it doesn't take a lot to please his palate. I also tried his rice, and it was nothing special.   While this place is a killer value and and a sweet family run establishment, we, sadly, won't be returning.",

The cuisine is mix of Indian, Pakistani and Afghan, designed to suit every taste, from spicy to not so spicy.   I have had several items but , such as the tender and juicy lamb kabob and most recently the Chicken Boti which was spicy and very good!  They serve goat, lamb, beef and chicken in a variety of dishes and many are able to be shared.  The service is somewhat slower because you generally have the owner being the watier and the menu explainer.  He will take the time to explain the food, how it is prepared and what may suit the taste you are looking for.   His wife loves to cook and that is how this place got started.  Interior decor is nothing special, very typical of an authentic place that just serves good authentic food!.  The Nan bread is fresh, warm and tender.  The hummus didn't really fit my taste, I have other places that I prefer hummus, it was more oily than most.  When I was in there last night, There are approximately 10 tables in the place and during my last visit I could overhear each table making comments about how good their food was.    There is a charge for bottled water (if you ask for \"water) and you will pay a .35 cent transaction fee for credit cards, testament again..to authenticity :)    I love this place and when I feel the itch for something different and adventurous for my taste buds,  I have not been disappointed yet.    I just wish they could pipe some low authentic music and it would top off the place!",

    "text": "Very good! Reminds me of my mom's cooking.  The chicken karahi is light but very flavorful. The portion is also really large. The chicken tikka masala was very good. I was a little disappointed by the goat biryani - the portion size was good, but the rice was dry. I also thought the raita (accompanying yogurt) was a little bland. The chick pea masala was pretty good, but a little simple for my taste. Still, it was nice that it wasn't drowned in overpowering spices.  The service is slow, but I think the prices are reasonable. I could definitely see this place becoming my go to Indian/Pakistani restaurant in Phoenix.",

Chicken Boti consisted of perfectly spiced and marinated chunks of chicken breast served over a non-greasy flavorful basmati rice mixture.    Riati sauce was a cilantro-based lemony garlicky sauce that reminds me of chimichurri sauce.  Tzatziki sauce wa sthinner than expected but necessary to balance the spice and still very good.  Baklawa was juicy and crispy and with a certain strange pice that made it better than usual.  Service was awesome, the owners were very patient, helpful and descriptive since I have never had this type of cuisine before.   Got a question, just ask them, they wer every nice.  A quick 10 minutes after ordering, my food was ready to go.  Since everything was so tasty, I can't wait to go back and keep trying the different things on their long menu!  I am a sucker for meat grilled to perfection which is what they served to me here.",

Dream of them now..... Chicken boti....bright orange., looks like a kebab, served with rice and cucumber salad. A nice safe dish. Chicken kahari....a curry type dish. Meat was moist and sauce was flavorful. Goat korma....the hit of the day, well, beside the mantoo. Rich, succulent. Like the bestpot roast yyou've ever had but better. We also had a bread type dish...looked li,e a pizza with no cheese or sauce. Had a bit of a vinegar taste.  Headed back next week to eat more....",

Portions are fairly gigantic and quite reasonably priced - especially delicious baklava for $1, which I've /never/ seen cheaper. In particular, the lamb kebob, the mantoo, and the gyros are favorites.  The woman who always waits on us works really hard, and she's always so nice. We were just there for a birthday, and she noticed that I didn't order anything besides a soda. I explained to her that I was quite broke, and she surprised me by bringing me a gyro on the house, which she remembered me getting last time and loving. This was more than a month ago! I nearly cried.   That being said, don't go in and try and get a free meal! It was just a really cool thing that she didn't have to do.  Anyway, this is the best Afghani/Pakistani food around. The only thing that could make it better would be to pick it up and put it right next to our apartment - but it's worth the drive.",

    "text": "I arrived at Khyber Halal on a Friday for an early dinner and my first experience with Afghani food.  But to my incredible astonishment, the owner (and coincidentally the first employee I met here) is a former high school classmate of mine.  Bilal Safi and I were not only classmates but also played on our high school basketball and football teams together.  Bilal and his sister Fahima actually co-own this mashup of Afghani, Pakistani, Indian, and even American cuisines (emphasis on the Afghani portion) on the southwest corner of 24th Street & Indian School.  I'd been eyeing this place for a visit for awhile, but now that I knew Bilal's family were running the show, I was pretty excited to give it a go.  The restaurant itself is pretty unassuming but comfortable with seating for maybe 40 inside.  Here you can order food to go up front or grab a seat and a server takes care of you.  Although I've become more knowledgable about food from the Middle East and African regions in recent years, I really had no clue what to expect when it came to Afghani cuisine.  I took a passing glance through Wikipedia to read up a little on Afghani food in advance so I at least had some idea of what to look for.  To start things off I ordered a glass of Dooge.  It's a cold yogurt based drink mixed with chopped up mint leaves.  It's not as thick as yogurt but has a somewhat similar texture.  The mint adds an extra cooling sensation to the tongue.  Flavor-wise its a little unusual, but then again that's why I'm here.  Bilal warned me in advance that the portions here are on the large side so I skipped the appetizer and went straight for Afghani food 101.  The Qabuli Pulaw is apparently widely considered to be the national dish of Afghanistan, so what better place to start?  At the base of the dish is Pulaw rice, which is white rice cooked with meat stock, carrots, raisins, and herbs and I think I even picked up a hint of pistachio.  Next to the rice is a healthy portion of chopped salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, and a little cilantro as well.  Atop the rice, a footlong meat kabob of seasoned ground beef.  The dish bears a resemblance to similar kabob dishes I've had various Middle Eastern restaurants, but the rice here stands out on its own.  I think its the raisins that really make this dish stand out, adding a subtle and pleasant fruity component.  Coupled with the salad and meat, the Qabuli Pulaw is a solid dish and a great gateway dish for those unsure as to whether they'd really enjoy Afghani food.  If you need a starting point, start with this dish.  Having enough room for dessert, I decided to try the Rusmalai.  I'd read up a little on this dish and ordered it mainly because of how unusual it sounded.  Basically its flatted balls of cheese curd soaked in cow's milk cream, and flavored with cardamom.  From there the flattened balls are cooked in milk, sugar, and rice pudding.  Here they come two flattened balls to an order, still doused with cream.  How to describe this.  Its a sort of sweet spongey, chunky, chewy, dairy bomb.  I actually really liked the cream in this dish, though the texture was certainly a new one on me.  Total cost for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $23.  I will say I'm still processing some of the experience as both the Dooge and the Rusmalai were completely new to me.  But the Qubuli Pulaw was an absolutely excellent main course.  Along with Afghani specials here, you'll find several other rice dishes along with curries, kabobs as well as some wraps and fried fish options.  There really are a lot of ways to branch out here while still eating something inherently comfortable and familiar.  Or you can go way outside the box on certain items as I did.  Bilal and Fahima delivered an interesting and tasty meal for me to try this go around, and I suspect they will next time too.  Great to see a fellow Central Bobcat giving the community a great go to spot.  Even if its origins are halfway around the globe.",

    "text": "Khyber is a great find in Phoenix!  Although they are marked as Afghani/Pakistani/Indian, I would definitely think they're more Afghani than anything based on the large cloth rug map of Afghanistan at the cashier's stand and the menu calls out Afghani specialities more than the other ethnic dishes.   I made a reservation ahead of time for my friends and I the day before just to be safe. We arrived that night and it wasn't terribly necessary despite it being dinnertime on a weeknight. Young waiter greeted everyone as we arrived. Table was already set and once a majority of us were seated he took our drink orders- all canned pop and mango lassi, no alcohol whatsoever.   Forewarning parking is a little limited since it's in a very small strip mall off 24th and Indian School.  Everyone ordered garlic naan and for one person it's like 3-4 pieces per, so our table was swimming in it! For the cost you get A LOT... more than what I expected. Absolutely naan-tastic!  The popular dish most of us ordered was mantoo (dumplings with a meat sauce). Uber tasty and not too starchy/heavy as most dumplings can be. I was a little disappointed they weren't served piping hot but I'm assuming that's how it's supposed to be served and eaten. It looks like dumplings with taco meat and other sauces, but the look is deceiving. I left with a clean plate and plenty of naan for my friends to take to go.  In total I spent $17 for dinner and it was worth every penny.",

The mantoo dish consists of 12 fairly large dumplings filled with meat, topped with a meat sauce (similar to a Bolognese). At first glance it doesn't look like enough to be a meal, but I was pretty full after finishing the plate and scooping up every last bit. The dumplings have a nice homecooked feel to them, which went well with the politeness of the staff. Food came out fast, and they gave my coworker his order of garlic naan for free because they forgot it until we had finished our food.  Another coworker got the beef shish kabob and said the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly, so I'll definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.",

A group wanted to have lunch here and invited me along and I was able to get to it easily with enough parking.   It's a medium sized spot with a good amount of seating and the decor is a mix of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and America. We were given menus as we arrived and chose our table. The food choices are plentiful and even have some vegetarian options (but only two fish). We mostly ordered waters but they have drinks like mango lassi and chai, black tea and green tea.   Our group of 8 seemed to each pick a different dish. I got the vegetable biryani and the portion size was enough to feed two, or in my case one with ample leftovers. It was the right amount of spice and flavors with a twist of corn added. I really liked it, and the veggie samosa was fine. The chatni (green chili sauce with mint and coriander) and yogurt sauce that come with the dish were tasty accompaniments to my meal. Affordable prices and good food, along with attentive service makes this a great choice for lunch or dinner.",

It was a ton of food for $20.00. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because their service is really bad. They did not even think to ask to refill our drinks. Once you ask for a refill they do refill your drink. They are not rude or anything, they just are not that concerned about serving you. My favorite meat was Chicken Boti, the workers even said that this is one of their best dishes they make.   If you want to try Middle Eastern food for the first time, this is the place I would recommend. It can be a little intimidating, but focus on the Chicken Boti, order a naan, or Tandoori Paratha and enjoy.",

It is very accurate. Although the Mantoo picture doesn't really emphasize that it is 12 pieces of deliciousness...  THIS PLACE IS FRICKING AMAZING, the service was excellent as well as friendly and it smells simply divine.  After several months of saying 'we need to stop at this place one day' we finally made it there last night for take-out. We ordered the following:  1) Chicken Karahi...MMMmmm MMMMmmm! We got an order of basmati rice and the flavors of this bone-in (but cut into manageable pieces) was fantastic. Never had anything like it, but it was awesome. I woke up this morning wanting more...but there was none.  2) Mantoo...this was possibly the star of an all-star show. We decided that they reminded us of dumplings or of non-fried crab rangoon, only filled with ground beef, seasonings and topped with one (technically two?) of the most delightful sauces ever.   3) Chicken Tikka Masala - I chose medium spicy this time...you know I HAD to have it. And it was delicious. (We also had the basmati rice with this one because it's a saucy dish and that's how I like it...if you ask nicely, they may let you substitute the naan that it comes with for rice instead)  4) Beef samosas AND Chicken samosas...both were fantastic, but I think I loved the beef one just a *little* bit more. The seasoning was superb. We also dipped it into the sauce that came with the mantoo...OMFG...wow.   5) Garlic naan...I've never met a garlic naan that I didn't like.  6) Baklawa (aka baklava)...one of the best I've ever had. Nutty and honey-ey...mmmm...  We're actually planning on going back again tomorrow night so I can try the okra bamya and the eggplant banjan and see what that bolanee/aloo paratha is all about.",

I have eaten Indian food all over the country (San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Baltimore, New York, Washington, the list goes on). I LOVE Indian food. If I had to choose a dying meal, it would be paneer masala with naan and basmati.  This restaurant served literally the least authentic Indian food I have ever eaten. They tried, but it is painfully Americanized, and I should have known based on the \"whitebread\" patrons here. They even serve hamburgers???  They did not serve basmati, instead it was just long grain white or brown rice, and very little seasoning. Their naan tasted like cheap, reheated, store bought pita bread, their sauces/curries were bland and lacking dimension, and the rest of their fare was the most average food I have ever had.  I tried this place because two other restaurants closer to me had a whole star less than this place (including the place recommended below), so I thought... It MUST be better. I was wrong.  If you want authentic Indian food I recommend New Indian Bazaar on 7th Street.",

I shared veggie kabob and rice, beef egg rolls, and chicken tikka masala. I'm happy to say that you get a ton of food with your order! The veggie kabobs were served on a huge bed of rice, and they were super fresh and flavorful. They're simple, but great! The egg rolls, which are only $0.99 a pop, were also very tasty, albeit a little greasy (they're deep-fried egg rolls though). I also can't forget to mention that the egg rolls come with a great spicy sauce!   And then there was chicken tikka masala... At $10.99 it's not the cheapest thing on the menu, but DAMN! It was sincerely some of the best chicken tikka masala that I've had in the valley (almost inching out one of my favorites at Z-Grill). They served it with an enormous piece of house-made naan. The masala was perfectly balanced in spiciness and thickness, and the chicken was cooked just right! Masala lovers from all over should try it!  I welcome Khyber Halal with open arms into the neighborhood! I'm always a fan of a new flavor in the area, and I can't wait to go again!",

    "text": "Great little family restaurant dishing up tasty, filling, authentic food. One of my co-workers with relatives from Pakistan highly recommended Khyber Halal as a restaurant that his family goes to for a taste of home, and this place absolutely lived up to his positive review!   I had the Chapli kabob, which is apparently very popular - and for good reason! This generously-portioned plate includes two large beef patties minced with herbs and served with a side of rice or naan (I chose the rice), as well as cucumbers and tomatoes. At $13, the asking price might seem a little high for lunch, but this is easily enough for two meals. Now, let's talk about the baklava (baklawa). This was *phenomenal* - rich, sweet, and with a perfect, flaky texture. I immediately wished for more and *may* have asked someone to pick a few pieces up for me later in the week.   Just a few notes: I would recommend placing a to-go order to beat the lunch rush. We ordered around 11:15 and our meals were ready to pick up within 15 minutes. Also, regarding the sides: the regular naan seemed more like a vessel for the saucier dishes than a standalone item. As other reviews have noted, this version of naan is thicker, and most of my coworkers found it to be a little plain on its own. That said, the garlic naan is very tasty and should absolutely be your choice if you like a little more flavor, or if you plan to eat the naan on its own.   Bottom line: Everyone in our office really enjoyed their meals from Khyber Halal. I think this one has been added to our lunch rotation!",

Badanjan is a grilled eggplant dish topped with some yogurt, really good and accompanied the lamb well. The Bamya is okra in a tomato based sauce was amazing and not slimy like okra can be. Highly recommended the samosa and Bamya. Know that Afghani naan is not the same as indian naan. Not in a bad way but it is not as soft. The sauces with the food were great.

It looked like there was more than one whole chicken in there, which is great. Same with the naan, they were huge. The owner was also very nice and cordial. Unfortunately, it comes down to the flavor, and the karhai was bland. I love afghani karhai and this one just did not deliver with the taste. The ajwain on the naan was also really overpowering. I think they should ask the customers if they want any on theirs, just like butter. It's not for everyone. I haven't tried any of their other dishes since I'm visiting from Houston, but I do hope they can improve their karhai flavor, coz it has great promise.",

Each bite was so full of taste. The chutneys with it had such a home like taste. Every thing was incredible. My husband ate more than we should and kept eating the leftovers for the rest of day after leaving. We also ordered Chapli kabab platter, Chaplikabab was also really good.",

    "text": "I love visiting independently owned restaurants that offer dishes you don't often find in AZ. Khyber Halal offers Afghan, Indian, and Pakistan cuisine, but I think more focus is on the Afghani items here.   The interior is cozy and homey, with various tables you can sit at. We had our choice of tables in the back for a party of 6. After you order and eat, you pay at the front which makes it easy if you were planning on doing split checks.   I had a mango lassi, and shared the qabuli pulaw (The national dish of Afghanistan) as well as the mantoo dumplings. The mango lassi came out first, and it had more of a sweet mango puree flavor than the tart yogurt flavor I'm used to with Indian style lassi. It was a very generous amount though for $2. It didn't take too long to make our entrees and when all our dishes came out we oohed and ahhhed. They looked so good and with very substantial portions too!   The qabuli pulaw was a footlong slab of ground meat, similar to kofta kebab, with cucumber salad and seasoned rice. All the elements together worked well in harmony. There were also two little sauce bowls with yogurt dip and a spicy green dip to go with it. The rice itself had a beautiful mix of spices, colors, and textures, and I loved the inclusion of soaked raisins in the mix. The cucumber salad was light and refreshing, a good complement to the earthy ground meat.  I also enjoyed the mantoo. It also was beautifully presented, with a thin wonton-like wrapper, ground spiced meat, drizzled with sauce.   I think overall the restaurant is very tidy and well kept. I was sitting against the wall and there was a slightly gross looking food stain on it though so they might want to pay attention to checking cleanliness there.  We had a good time feasting on our dinners and chatting. If I were in the area this would be a great choice for a delicious meal.",

They talk up a giant potato pancake that they make. Like, they REALLY talk this potato thing up. And it was a stretch to get my boyfriend to be this adventurous in eating to begin with, so a giant potato pancake was part of my convincing him to go with me.  So we ordered it... but we had to pay for it and pick it up the next day. What a special pancake! Takes 24 hours to make!  We go back the next day to get the pancake in anticipation of this being the greatest use of a potato ever, and let's just say it fell far short of all expectations.  I cannot for the life of me figure out what took 24 hours to prepare it. And I had to use my imagination to taste potato. It was more like a giant naan - like 48 sq ft naan.  Either way, I recommend the Khyber Halal. Avoid the lunch crowd. And pass on the potato pancake.  Try some deserts instead.",

    "text": "I'm seriously beginning to question, whether Yelp reviewers are actually former incarcerated felons, who had such lousy food in jail, that almost anything decent will merit 4 or 5 stars.  Seriously:  what about this place rates 4 or 5 stars?!?  Yeah, the kids, who help run the place are adorable and well-mannered, but that's not a reason to rave about the restaurant ... or is it?    Let's talk about what's NOT cute:  One of our companions ordered the kabli pulao from the menu.  He did state, that the meat was fairly decently spiced, but the rest of the dish was pretty bland.  His plate, for some reason, came with plain pilaf, which did even less to relieve the blandness.  My plate had the Afghan rice with raisins, so it was a little better.  However, the presentation of the kabli leaves something to be desired.  I would seriously consider altering its shape, since it arrives at your table shaped like a long .... Well, let's just say, I wondered whether one of my dogs from home got into the restaurant and had an accident on his plate  (my companion assures me, that would not have been possible as the food would then have had more flavor than it did).  I had the lamb shank.  It, too, came with enough rice to feed an Afghan family of 7.  And, as much as I love carbs, most of it sat on my plate at meal's end.  The lamb was very fatty, but, hey, that's what gives it taste.  Unfortunately, it was the ONLY dish with lamb available at the restaurant (which, for an Afghani restaurant is as bizarre as going to an Italian restaurant and them not having pasta!).  As an appetizer, I had the hummus, which was -- surprise -- bland.  The bread they serve with it -- allegedly naan -- bore an amazing resemblance to Little Caesar's cheesy bread.  Good, but not naan in any sense of the word I know.  My partner had the chicken tikki masala, which, to me, looked almost like pho (soup) when it came out.  However, he said it was not only very good, but creamy.  They did not, however, bother to ask him how spicy he wanted it, so it came out in a neutral, middle spiciness, which, according to him, added just enough spice to avoid it being --- you got it --- bland.  Service was attentive and extraordinarily polite, especially when considering our server probably doesn't yet know how to shave.  Overall, we won't be coming back here.  The food was bland and nothing particularly exciting.  If, as one of the reviewers stated, the cooking reminds her of how mom made dinner at home, she should immediately close Yelp, drive to mom's, and blow up her pots and pans.  Many of the reviewers here have written, that the dishes come with plenty of food.  But this isn't exactly True:  when it comes down to it, the main dish portions aren't big at all and you're served truckloads of cheap rice to fill out the dishes.  As my partner stated:  \"you really have to read these reviews with a grain of salt\".    Perhaps.  But if you intend to take reviews of this place with a grain of salt, make sure to bring your own with you:  as bland as the food is here, you won't find any salt laying around to use",

We applaud any business that teaches business acumen to the next generation. The selection was limited for fish dishes, out of shrimp, dishes discontinued, etc.  We opted for the fried tilapia. The fried tilapia was seasoned and cooked very well. We don't process professional palates so it doesn't require a five star zagats resort critique. We were the only customers in the restaurant and the sons allowed us to enjoy our meal and checked on our needs. (We have to confess we did ask the high school tech savvy youngster to review the Yelp reviews before ordering)  Our food companion ordered the lamb dish and from my observation it had to be great. I was the only one talking. A rare first. If you decide to partake in some authentic Afghani cuisine this is the spot. The son's speak Farsi (Persian, Iran's state language). Read a review where someone said Pakistani/Indian cuisine. Doesn't really matter the meals were good.",

    "text": "We r from chicago and came to khyber halal after reading positive reviews on yelp. The restaurant is charming, quaint, and well - decorated with authentic afghani decor and pieces, also very clean. The owner/head chef Fahima greeted us and was our server. She was incredibly pleasant and gave us great recommendations. She discussed that she tries to use organic ingredients and tries to make dishes healthy for her customers. All of her meat entrees are halal.  Our first visit we had beef samosa and shami kabob for appetizers. Each came with fresh green chutney and tasted as if she had just freshly hand made the dough, meat, and chutney. We ate afghani dishes including kabli pulao and uzbek pulao, both spectacular. The helpings of rice are heaping, and you'll definitely have leftovers. Thr prices are very reasonable.  Since our visit, my family reminisced about the delicious taste of her food every meal in phoenix, nothing compared. We came back and tried her pakistani dishes, equally delicious! Her naan is so plump and tastes made in a tandoor.  This place is always crowded and filled with a diverse crowd.  Mango lassi is perfect after a morning hike. Dessert including phirni and baklawa taste homemade.  We will probably b back again during our vacation, but wanted to post this since I am truly in love with this place. The owner Fahima is incredibly talented and will probably b known as a great chef in the near future.    If you are in phoenix, definitely visit this place, your taste buds will not forget it!",

We had the chicken karahi (sadly, they were out of goat)...aka, the chicken curry... and mantoo.  The former came with big, thick naan bread that was a bit heartier than what I've seen in Indian restaurants.  The latter is like a ground beef ravioli with middle eastern spice and yogurt drizzled on top.  Both were great, and we've earmarked a couple additional menu items should we have the opportunity to return.  I highly recommend giving this place a try.",

    "text": "I am giving it a 2 star only because a) the food is okay not so great b) service is average and c) very, very pricey for a kabob joint.  There's clearly a trick in the menus; there are no combos of two items. The closest thing is the mixed grill but that's way too much for one person and the proportion is for at least two people.  So, what do you do when, for example, you want to combine lamb and chicken (1 skewer each)? In my case, I added the chicken boti with my lamb but the extra charge was $7.99 so my single order, a custom combo, came out to be about $18.00!!! No rice! They give you an option between rice and bread with your Primary order (lamb kabob in my case) so I picked bread and paid an extra $7.99 for a single skewer of chicken.   I don't think I will return here again, it's a complete rip off.",

The meat and the vegetable dishes are very tasty. I especially like the Chicken Handi, the Sabzi (spinach) and the Bandanjan (eggplant). Kabli, the Afghani rice, is made with raisins and carrots (delicious) and the rice pudding is so creamy (oh my!!!). The portions are huge. I am an enthusiastic fan; so much so that I just had Khyber cater our party for 75 friends. Everyone (True foodies) loved the food. Their catering service is very professional and reasonable. This ethnic restaurant is a jewel in the desert.",

Pace yourself or you'll be stuffed as your fork hits the bottom of that plate.   Trust me, in your lifetime everyone should try a Gulab jamun. In laymen's terms that would be a little ball of dough. Two of these ping pong sized balls come in a container. You won't want to share. I mean, the civil thing would be to share. But really, once your spoon touches the sweet cardamom syrup that's involved. Mmm...I don't think so. A moment on the lips a memory forever.  Moving on. Just remember to leave room for dessert. There are other sweets available up front to choose from, I'll report back next time. (Gosh darn it. They've got me.)  Zipping into the nondescript shopping center we studied the menu upfront. We seated ourselves in the dining area, which is a no-frills kind of place. (There's a TV if anyone really, really needs that.) Our server was quick to take our order and our food was out lickity split.  Spicy means hot! (If you opt for spicy be prepared.) The Chicken Tikka Masala was divine with copious amounts of chicken. Served with four large artistically cut pieces of naan leftovers abound.  The Kabli Pulao really does come with a foot long serving of a beef shish kabob.  (The beef has been shredded and molded into this arc of a shape.) The rice was airy and well balanced with raisins and shredded carrots.The accompanying chatni sauce was a delightful surprise on top of all the goodness involved.   Note that there is no beer or alcohol on the menu.  Just remember, pace yourselves!",

The Bad and the Ugly: The Saag Paneer was DISGUSTING.  It was bland as hell.  I had one spoonful and tossed it.  And their Goat Karahi, which is a dish that is close to my heart, was DISGUSTING and watery.  How does karahi get that watery?  It actually looked weird.  It did not taste like it was cooked in a wok, the spices and tomatoes were not cooked down at all, and there was an inch layer of fake ghee on top.   And when I asked for it to be spicy, someone just dumped pickled jalapenos in the dish---which made it look less like a karahi.  And I love goat meat but this tasted so gamey and it really looked unappealing, I also threw away 90% of this dish.  And the naan, as someone else said, was thick and spongy, with a yeasty after taste.  I hated it.  Everything was $34 and I threw away practically all of it --- it was nasty to me.  The kabob (and me being a huge softy) saved it from being a one star experience.",

After all I decided to come here based on a quick yelp scan.   My mother ordered a goat stew dish. Before she even bite into it she smelled something funny. She decided to at least give it a try. She could not believe what she tasted. It was very old and rotten (the goat).   I was shocked. I didn't know how to tell the waitress. I decided to politely tell her what had happened to at least warn her that something was wrong with the meat. I went to also grab a plate for my mom to share my food. As I was talking to the waitress, another lady popped up (I'm assuming was the cook). She insisted that it's normal and goat always smelled like that and that my mother must have not had goat before. I told her that she actually has and cooks it at home all the time. I saw she was offended and got awkward so I went back to my table to eat.   When I was paying, I asked if I was going to be charged for the entree my mom didn't eat and that she picked up. She (the cook/manager) said yes you have to pay, then started to attack me. She stated that other people had eaten that same dish earlier and loved it. That we were offending her.  I told her calmly that I didn't mind paying for it. It wasn't a big deal. I was just shocked at her rudeness and lack of customer service.   *funny thing is I told her I found her on yelp and that I would leave my own review. She stated go ahead. I didn't want to, but after what had transpired, this is your WARNING everyone.",

This establishment is clean and just to prove it they have a sink outside the restrooms as well as inside the restroom, for the person that would usually use a napkin or dispensed paper for opening  up the door after hittin' the restroom. That makes me smile.  The food is healthy as all get out, tasty chunks of flavorful chicken that are juicy. NEVER  EVER  HAVE I HAD A GRISLY CHUNK OF MEAT HERE - NEVER. Nice!  The rice is rich n' hearty as well as being flavorful, it's not exaggerated with any seasonings, somehow it's always just right.  They do have baklava and a bunch of other nice deserts. The beverage selection is great for my situation (alkalinic causing foods = cancer prevention) that'd be organic lemonade.   The price fits my budget any time of year and is a bargain for what you're getting. A healthy flavorful meal.

It is serverd with their \"naan\" bread which is much more like a thick tandoor bread.  This was just a quick take out order and I am excited to try everything they have to offer.",

    "text": "If you have been reading reviews about how spicy their food is, prepare to be underwhelmed. But, it could just be because I am used to eating a lot of hot spices.  Beyond that, their service is great! In my opinion Their Chicken tikka masala is about good and flavorful but nothing to write home about. Their biryani is okay. It seemed to lack consistency in flavor between the chicken and the rice. The owner asked me how spicy I wanted it. I told them as hot as they can make it. She asked if I was sure and I said aboseffilutely! I was extremely disappointed when I didn't even break a sweat :(  Their Nihari however is a completely different story. How different you say..? Well, it is downright top notch! Spicy, tons of flavor and all around consistency in thickness. If you are in the Phoenix area and grew up in the subcontinent eating nihair then let me tell you that the next place to get it would be your grandma's dusty old kitchen back home. I have not had it this good even in Houston, Dallas or the desi infused parts of California. I triple highly recommend it!  For dessert I saw that they had gulab jamun on the menu. People who know me and my bloating love handles know how I cannot ever pass these things up. I asked the waitress if she recommended it and she said no. Being the stubborn bastard I am I ordered it any way. Boy was she ever right. Their Firni is much better and I'd go for that in a heartbeat if I were you.",

My family is also African and I'm used to food that has seasoning, flavor, taste etc. I have traveled all over the world and tasted a variety of different foods from different countries that were quite exquisite and flavorful. So I decided to try this place on a trip to Arizona and I was extremely disappointed. The bread was dry as hell and tasted a bit sour it was also hard and thick (no resemblance to naan) , the rice had absolutely no flavor, the paneer tikka masala was also bland no seasoning just red sauce and cheese. I don't know if it is because people in Arizona are trapped in a desert and have never tasted real food, but there was nothing delightful or tasty about this restaurant and I do not know who gave these good ratings. Not to come at you Arizona people, but really? This is what y'all think is good food???? Also, The mango lassi tasted like water.  DISGUSTING.   service was questionable as well. Please try to tantalize your taste buds at least once in your life if you actually eat this food and think it's good.  Peace & blessings y'all.",

Inside is very clean and the decor is casual and fun. This is a nice family owned restaurant and you can feel that vibe right away. The kids work the front part of the restaurant and Mom does her magic in the kitchen.  Started off with some Chicken and Beef Samosas and went with the famous Chicken Tikka Masala extra spicy. It was delicious and had plenty of tasty flavors bursting in my mouth. The heat level was very high and perfect for my taste buds. Nice!  Came back again and ordered the Kabli Pulao (Kofta) plate. Again the portion size and the flavors were exceptional and even had some left to bring home. Really love the way she makes the rice with the raisins and carrots in the dish. Going to have to try and reproduce this bad boy at home.  They have a rather large menu that can accommodate almost any diet or request. Appetizers, Snacks, Kababs, Currys, Wraps, Burgers, and Vegetarian choices if you are in the mood for a meat free meal. They also have a good variety of sweet Desserts to cap off your visit.  Service is friendly and the food is delicious. Can't wait to bring the family back and maybe get me some Goat on my next visit. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. OH YEAH!  5 STARS",

It reminds me of LA, where you can get food from any country that's presumably as good as what you'd get there.   My roommate and I stumbled upon this place after getting gas at Circle K, and were delighted by the airy garlic naan--best I've ever had--and the well-balanced, perfectly seasoned mantoo. (That Afghan term for dumplings sounds just like the Korean one!) The dumpling skins were incredibly chewy and the sauce-to-filling and filling-to-skin ratio were ideal. The lamb kabob was tasty too (just reordered), though I've had more tender. The green (cilantro?) yogurt sauce was the perfect complement to the lamb, rice, and fresh veggie mix.  To top things off, our server Kamila was super friendly and fun, giving us helpful recommendations and, when we returned, remembering our exact order!   We will be back again and again when in the area.",

It's also super reasonably priced. You get an EXTREME amount of food for a decent price. My husband once ordered a chicken curry dish and they asked him full or half. Since he loves leftovers from this place he said full, it looked like it was literally a whole chicken! For like $13! It's amazing food too, that is completely unique to Phoenix. I know that Afghani food sounds like it might be extreme, but it's really good and not that crazy. I recommend starting with something simple like the Chicken Boti (if you like spicy) or the Chicken Mali Boti (if you don't) and getting crazier from there.  My only disappointment, they almost always sell out of baklava before I can get my hands on it!",

I've only been here once but already am eager to work my way through the entire menu. I went there earlier this month with three friends. We all sampled each other's food and nobody was in the least displeased with anything. First off, I will continue to sing the praises of the mantoo. These dumplings--which are the Afghani equivalent of Chinese wontons or ravioli--are filled with ground beef and onion and then topped with a yogurt sauce and a red sauce. Tender and flavor, little dough-bites of heaven. Another highlight was the goat curry. I had a taste of my friend's and it was perfectly tender. And the sauce is a great mix with their jasmine rice. I had the chicken boti in which the flavors were felt all the way through the meat. They have a few different kinds of naan bread. Loved the garlic naan but you'll need a breath mint later. I saw some reviews said the service is so-so. It did seem like we had to wait 5 or 10 minutes longer than one might be used to. But the restaurant--which isn't that big--was almost completely full. It's also important to note we were the only non-Middle-Eastern/Indian customers so that tells you the level of authenticity is pretty good. The service may have taken a bit longer but nobody was rude. Also, it looks like the kind of place where you go up to the register to take care of your bill. Anyway, I plan to make Khyber Halal a stop when I have visitors in town.",

I highly recommend the lamb shank, beef kabob, and the goat biriyani as well!!! So much flavor in every bite here. The staff when we've gone has been two younger guys and they are so helpful and adorable. We will be back!!!!",

I had a mango yogurt drink and started with one beef samosa and one veggie samosa, both were wonderful, then we each had an entre and both entres were amazing and big enough to share or take home.  I just finished my left overs from eating there last night.  The atmosphere was casual and comfortable.  I would feel comfortable eating there by myself or with a friend.  I will definitely be back and my boyfriend has been talking about the food since we left there last night.",

    "text": "I've eaten Khyber Halal twice now, both times for take out. Everything I've had there is pretty delicious, definitely good Indian/Pakistani/Afghan food for the Valley. The chicken tikka masala was classically delish, I feel like it's hard to go wrong with heavily spiced and sauced chicken. The naan was fabulous, and if I weren't so full from the other things on my plate I would have eaten much more of it. Definitely worth eating with sauce alone. Lamb kabobs are also a solid choice, again another classic dish that it's hard to go wrong with. What really stood out for me, though, was the mantoo! I ordered the mantoo on a lonely night at home, by the recommendation of the guy behind the counter. It was SO garlic-y, but SOO meaty, creamy, and delicious. My roommates were flabbergasted by the smell of the house when they got home, and I definitely couldn't finish a full order of the garlicy goodness on my own. I'll definitely go back and try more options, but I'm excited to get more mantoo in my belly (hopefully chased with some naan next time to dull the spices).",

While not Indian, many of the dishes are novel takes on Indian & Middle Eastern dishes you may already know, like curries, kabobs, biryanis & naan. All of the dishes are marked by a fresh & vibrant taste. It really seems like homemade food, not churned out by the pot load. And the owners are very friendly and make for a nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "Couple guys I work with found this place on Yelp so we went to check it out.  We may have come on a bad day being a Friday and they close from 12:30 to 1:30 to pray but we did make it in early enough.  At first was concerned because they were missing some spices so a few of the items we were thinking about were off the menu.  But we asked what type of chicken was his favorite and he said the Boti Chicken so we gave that a try.  we ended up getting the rice served along with the dish and ordered the Nan? (bread) as a side everything was really good the Boti has a little bite to it but not too much very good but do want to sample a few more dishes before deciding on a favorite.  I will keep you informed on my explorations in the future because we all decided this place needs to be on our regular lunch rotation.",

Since I was from out of town I decided to give them a call and confirm there hours, I was told last order is an hour before the restaurant closes. Me and three of my coworkers grabbed a cab and headed over there. We arrived an hour and ten minutes before closing, as we headed to a table the cashier, Abudallah told us take out only. We mentioned to him that we called and they said as long as we come an hour before closing we would be served. He repeated take out only, we told him we were from out of town and didn't have a place to take them. He told us that was what the manager had told him, we asked to see the manager, he told us that the manager wasn't available. At this point he said we are out of food, and pretty much told us to get the F out. Couldn't believe it, ended up spending $40 in cabs without getting anything to eat. We ended at Curry Corner(Tempe), with better service.",

    "text": "We went out last night to the movies, and with an hour and a half to spare, we thought we had time to stop at this newish restaurant on the corner of Indian School and 24th St. It was a family owned place, baby in bassinet by the cashier, and absolutely no explanations of what the food is. Just strange names. We ordered and sat down. 35-40 minutes later, we realized the food still hadn't come and we'd never make it out to Scottsdale for our movie. So, disappointed, we took the food when it finally came and brought it home and ordered something up on Amazon. When I dove into the \"to go\" boxes, I stopped complaining. Man, that food was delicious. I ordered the Chicken Tikka, only because I pretty much knew what it would be, and it far beat my expectations. Our Chicken Kabab (ordered again because we knew what it would be) was delicious as well. To the owners, thank you for being here. We'll be back. Please develop something that describes the food, and make a non-egg version of the Naan bread please! Lots of vegans and allergies out there who don't expect food from  your region to have heavy eggs included. Readers, as long as you set your expectations correctly about time for food preparation, you'll be very happy with Khyber Halal. Get in there and support this neighborhood gem!",
