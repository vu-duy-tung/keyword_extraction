I love the view here and the fact that the room rotates, fun!! If you haven't been, you definitely should!! It is just very, very different for Phoenix. The best time to go is around sunset. I used to go on special occasions and would just get a drink and enjoy the view. But the view, it is really truly awesome and fun!!  Soo romantic & intimate.. now just to get my guy to actually want to go for the view (he's heard the food is bad).",

    "text": "I can't usually afford to eat at fancy places like this, but my boyfriend was celebrating a milestone birthday and I wanted to treat him. We had been wanting to come here for a long time, mostly because we love the Simpsons and Springfield has a rotating restaurant. \"Food tastes better when it's revolving,\" as Seymour Skinner once said. Plus, when we first started dating, we went on a walk around the city that ended up with us taking the elevator to the Compass and the staff kindly let us admire the view even though we weren't paying customers.  Anyway, being treated kindly by the staff and the novelty of it made it an obvious choice for a special dinner. And we weren't disappointed! Another thing, we are vegetarians and my man is lactose intolerant, and they definitely went out of their way to accommodate our dietary needs. They gave him special dairy-free bread, specially prepared his entree without cheese, and even treated us to free lemon sorbet after the meal as there wasn't anything without dairy on the regular menu! They did a great job of making us feel at home.  While we don't usually pay $25 for an entree, this was definitely worth it as an indulgence and we would love to come back for other special occasions.  The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that the decor could stand to be updated, and (this is not the restaurant's fault in the slightest) Phoenix's skyline is 3 stars at best, even at sunset. Be prepared to see a lot of dirty rooftops and air conditioners. It's still fun though.",

    "text": "As a frequent traveler and a new Yelper there are thee categories I rate a restaurant on and they are the price point, how good the food is, and the ambiance (including views). Many times I find that a restaurant with great views usually is also expensive, but lacking in the food category. I can definitely say that the food was average at the Compass Arizona Grill while the views were nice. The restaurant is more of a classic ambiance than a modern innovative hip spot. I am a fan of Brie, so we had the Brie Fondue and unfortunately it wasn't as great as I would expect, but it was definitely average. For dinner I had the Jidori Chicken Breast, again the food was very average. Great presentation and naming as with most hotel restaurants, but the actual taste and love of the dish wasn't there for me. Again the food isn't bad and if you are going for the views it's a great place. The price point to me was on point for what you get (which is carried by the views, not the food).",

If you want to take them to the place with the best food in town, this is NOT the place.  In fact, I think for the price, if you get the steaks, and even the salad, i think you will be a little disappointed, especially with the prices they charge.  And whatever you do, when they offer you the choice (which I often find to be a tacky maneuver) \"do you want tap water or bottled water\" makes sure you do the BOTTLED water.  The tap water tasted, well, like tap.    At any rate, because this is the best and most amazing view in town, i will be going back for the rotating 360 views.  I will also ask to sit in the \"party section\" (which is tables that look more fun than the other dining tables they have, and I am going to find SOMETHING on that menu that actually tastes good.  I agree with some other posts I have seen, you cannot go wrong with the CORNBREAD, but I need to find something else that's good (man cannot live on cornbread and butter alone).  Blue cheese salad was disappointing; mac and cheese so-so, fried asparagus so-so, pig tacos were not bad, and the tamale dish was so-so (yes, we sampled as this was our first time).  Honestly, they need to find a new meat vendor.  Just not very tasty (even for street tacos the next morning).  Anyway, I love the concept so i will go back and try again.  Will report back after next time in.

The decor is tired and the windows weren't really clean....which was a turn off as the sun went down.  The scallops I ordered were a bit tough and slightly fishy and the wheat berries were not quite al dente.  The coconut creme brulee trio only offered one of the three as palatable...I couldn't eat the other two.  Fortunately, I had a good server who knows his stuff.  Noticing I didn't eat the other two brulees, he offered to take it off the bill for me.  I left a generous tip just for that.  I guess it would be a fine place for a prom date, but found my $50 dinner bill a bit steep for my experience.",

This restaurant is located inside the Hyatt Regency hotel... a circular shaped building that spins (yes, spins) to give you a rotating view of the entire city. It's absolutely beautiful and the ambiance is incredibly romantic.   I ordered the Double Cut Lamb Rack and he ordered the Angus Ribeye. The meat was cooked exactly the way we requested... we both prefer medium and the chef figured out the perfect balance of not to bring it out bloody - but not overcooked either. We finished off with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake, some fancy chocolate cake and a red wine our server recommended. I definitely LOVED the dessert more... SO much so that he had to remind me how many hours we would be in the gym tomorrow. Talk about a sugar buzz kill...  The wait staff are friendly and consistently check on you. We didn't have to wait for water refills or the bill to come out. I was definitely impressed.

The reason for the low rating is because once we were home we realized the restaurant double charged us, which was a significant amount, and when we called to ask why we were charged we were informed there was no manager available to speak with. Someone later on called us back to tell us there was a system error and it would take a few business to be refunded. I understand accidents happen, but with such an inconvenience it makes it hard to want to go back with barley an \"I'm sorry\" and a refund of the money that I shouldn't have been charged in the first (that will come in a few business days). I'm really disappointed this is how our night ended.",

The service was more than adequate.    It appears the windows were cleaner than my last visit which definitely made the experience special.   If you are new to Phoenix; there are better places to get a steak to be sure but the Compass just offers a special environment with beautiful views you will not find elsewhere.",

    "text": "Settled in on the 24th floor of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Phoenix Arizona, the Compass Grill is a rotating restaurant with an incredible view of the city. This was my second time dining here, and I had such great memories of the first time. If you can set your reservation for around 5:30-6:00 PM, I recommend that so you can experience it during the day and night and also watch the sun go down. It's typically doesn't open until 5 PM so it's strictly a dinner restaurant. It's definitely advised to make a reservation as it does get popular and packs in fast. I recognize it is very much a date night kind of restaurant. A lot of couples were there. The first time we went there I dined with my fiance and his family. The second time, my fiance hadn't gotten into town yet so it was only myself and my fiance's parents. I ordered sn Italian Pinot Grigio, and my fiance's dad ordered a bourbon. He ordered it near, he always orders it on the rocks so I asked him why. He said because the last time we dined there the restaurant charged him for a glass of rocks. FYI, the ice will cost you. They brought out jalapeno and chili cornbread and multi grain rolls with honey butter and regular, whipped butter. I ordered a beet and burrata salad with salmon. You can choose your protein on any of their salads and customize it to your liking. My fiance's mother had the lobster bisque and wedge salad, and my fiance's father order the filet with roasted, heirloom potatoes. Everyone seemed more than satisfied with your meal. The service was great as well. All of the items came out in great timing. We were never hungry or impatient, and we had a lot of time to converse in between each item was dropped. Altogether it only cost $132 which is not bad for a fine dining experience. I recommended this restaurant not only for its food, but for the unique atmosphere and breathtaking environment/view.",

It's at the top of the Hyatt and the entire restaurant slowly rotates so you can see the view of the city as you spin around. Unfortunately it was dark when we came, and raining, so the view was not optimal. This would be awesome at sunset for a romantic date!  The food was delicious. Everything we tried, we liked. The fondue was a wonderful way to start out our meal. The wedge salad was also fabulous. It comes with dates and apples and bacon - really a nice combination. I ordered the pasta - Truffled Bolognese. It was also delicious.... A nice earthy pasta with a hint of unexpected sweetness at the end. The portion was large - I did not finish it all. I would get that again. For dessert we had the black and white chocolate cake. Between two of us we could not finish it - SOOOOOO RICH! Wow, just one bite was enough!!   The hostess at the front desk was very nice and pleasant. She was great at managing lots of people. Our waitress was weird!! She did not make our experience enjoyable at all. She was like a robot. Plunking things down, picking things up. No smile or joy in her. She even sort of chewed out one of the other workers in front of us. It made our dinner sort of wonky, and the only reason my review is not five stars. When you go out to eat somewhere pricey, it's an entire experience, and she definitely was a buzz kill.   It's easy to walk here from all the major Convention Center hotels so that's a plus. We did not have a car on this trip.",

The presentation of the brie appetizer could have been a bit more than smeared sauce around the brie and a serrated knife would have worked much better than a bread knife. The wedge salad was good as was the mahi special. The dessert was complimentary due to the wait time for the food.

'but what else did you do?'  no clue..thats the only memory ive retained O_o  (this has been my answer for years)  ---  After Dec. 2010:  'hey heather, have you ever been to phoenix before?'  yep! had a lovely time being shown around by my awesome guy...he took me up to the Compass Room where I got a panoramic view of the entire city during a full yellow moon.  It was really special :) And though more gushy a story than (previously) comical...I'm happy I now have this answer to share  ---  As a visitor to Phoenix, places like the Compass Room really shine to me. Beautiful, classy, iconic...this is a place to go for special occasions. Where *every* table is a good table to have a fantastic view of the entire city skyline while you slowly rotate around with good company. There are little plaques telling you what you are viewing throughout the time, which is neat.  We came around 9pm on week night during the holidays so it was fairly quiet and slightly atypical in social atmosphere, I imagine. Just for a glass of wine and a shared dessert - Bread Pudding (delicious). We were well taken care of by our professional and friendly server and had a lovely time.",

Christmas seemed to be the day to cast the concerns to the wind and go anyway and i am glad we did.   The experience was awesome and the service and food were consistent with the best of prior reviews we had read. The view and atmosphere only enhanced the food. I particularly enjoyed the grilled beets and crab/oyster selection. There were 4 people in our party (each with different food tastes and interests) but there seemed to be a favorite for everyone.  It was still expensive but as a once a year trip, well worth it.",

    "text": "This establishment is just ok. Nice facility but the service was subpar. I came here for a business trip at the recommendation of some colleagues. The hostess informed me that there were no reservations until 8pm and refused to seat us although there were open tables. We just decided to look online and check for reservations. Reservations were available beginning at 6:30pm and every half hour so we booked one. We go back to the hostess table and tell her we booked a reservation and she greeted us by rolling her eyes and telling another hostess that they needed to turn off the online reservations. Since we were there, we asked if we could be seated early (it was 6:10pm) she made us wait another 20 minutes although several tables were empty (and remained so). Once seated, tables did not become full until well after 8pm, so in my opinion, this establishment just wanted to maintain an air of \"exclusivity\" or they didn't want to seat my group (a group of professionally dressed women). Our waitress wasn't especially friendly either.  Another server, Jackie who brought us water was exceptionally sweet though. I don't think she was assigned to any specific table but she constantly checked on us to make sure we were ok. The food was ok, nothing that really stood out. The major piece of this location is definitely the views of the city which were beautiful. My recommendation...if you can get beyond the snobbery, save your money and just visit to take pictures.",

    "text": "When looking into this restaurant on yelp I was really iffy about going to spend my 5 year anniversary here because of the reviews, but I decided to give this place a chance and make a reservation.  Walking into this restaurant is a little scary because it's constantly rotating. The views are amazing as it slowly rotates for you to see the entire city. The inside of the Compass Grill is very nice and well kept. I got lost a few times going to the restroom because it's in constant rotation.  As my fiance and I looked over the menu I decided to order the steak medallions and my fiance ordered the lamb shank. I ordered my steak with a side of macaroni and cheese. For an appetizer, we ordered the pork belly tostadas. As our food came out the presentation was great, but I wish I could say the same for the food. The steak was cooked medium well as requested, but it was warm, the same with the macaroni and cheese. I was pretty disappointed my food did not come out hot. Same for my fiance's food it was warm. Despite the warm food we continued to eat and enjoyed the views. Shortly after eating and heading to my car I begin to not feel well, I'm sure if the macaroni I ordered had something to do with my upset stomach but it ruined the night.  I really wanted to like this restaurant but the food is just not up there. I would have rather went to Orange sky, or Donovans considering the price we paid for our meal. If you are a first timer trying this place just have the pork belly tostadas or a drink, the food is not worth the price.",

The restaurant spins at a slow rate but it was enough for me to feel a little lightheaded. The drinks were good and about $10 -$15 each. Our party split the calamari, watermelon brushetta, and burrata caprese. The calamari tasted fishy to me but the other two apps were delicious. Service was good but they did forget my salad. My main course was the filet with herb potatoes. The filet was slightly overcooked and the potatoes heavily salted.  The lobster from my cousin's plate was chewy. I recommend the corn.

My bf and I wanted to watch the sunset so we went earlier and regretted it. Sun beaming in our eyes, our fault for picking the time. And views of dirty rooftops everywhere.  But like I said, once the sun set it was nothing but glittering lights.  We went for 4th if July, the food was honestly overpriced and very bland. My dish was about $40 for pasta with possibly tomato juice and a few chunks of lobster.  The wait staff was nice and attentive but the worst part was bill. I got home and realized they ran my card twice. They got an extra $100 out of me and now it's my responsibility to try and get my own money back. A huge inconvenience to have an extra $100 out of my acct.  It took them a second to take the money but god knows how many days it will take me to get my money back.  Update - so I called the compass room about my bill and they informed me they charged both my bf and I double. Wow, an extra $200 total for food. They tried to explain its like a holding charge as if you're reserving a hotel. But guess what, we didn't reserve a hotel. No restaurant out there charges extra money and holds it.  They apparently knew what happened and didn't tell us about it in hopes we wouldn't notice and wouldn't call in. That's very shady to me that they knew and said nothing.  They promised we'd get our money back in 24 hrs but it's been 3 days and still I've yet to get my hard earned money back.  So far going to the Hyatt has been the BIGGEST regret ever.  I wanted so badly to have a wonderful anniversary with my bf and instead I ended up with a huge bill, bland food, and missing money for services not rendered.  Now I have to report them to the BBB if the money is not back in my acct and my bfs acct Monday morning. Do not eat here. The view is not worth it and you're better off at orange sky.",

Not only does it give you a rotating view from on high, they also post little signs on the window to tell you what you're looking at! The way the place is set up you are either right next to the window or one table down (the cooks in the kitchen are the only ones who miss out on the view). The service was great our waiter was very knowledgeable and there was a really sweet runner Jackie who went around making conversation and ensuring you had everything you needed. The food is very good- not life changing. The presentation is really what sets the food apart. All in all I would absolutely recommend this for a special occasion or out of town era.",

All the seats have fantastic views so there is no need to request view seating as I did. We were seated immediately even though we were early. Service was very good and our drinks and bread were delivered promptly. We sat for a while before ordering dinner and were not rushed. Our food order came promptly and was excellent. Had a starter wedge salad and lobster bisque. Both were very good. Main dishes were lobster cavatappi (pasta) in a creme sauce, a filet mignon  a chicken dish. Everything was excellent.   Prices are reasonable and as is typical, if you hold back on the drinks, the total cost is very reasonable as the entree prices are very fair.   The views here are unbeatable as the restaurant makes a complete rotation every hour or so. We'll definitely be back, a fun place.",

    "text": "Nice looking place but overrated & not a great experience.  I made a reservation from the day before for 9pm.  When I got there the reservation somehow wasn't in their system.  Even though I was sent a confirmation text.  Then the girls at the front made us wait 15 minutes for a table when half the place was empty which didn't make sense.  Then when I asked them how much longer towards the end they gave me an attitude & acted like I was stupid for questioning them. How dare I ask any questions when I did everything right & things weren't adding up.  The food was also overpriced and not that great.  The baked Mac & cheese was good but the steaks we received just didn't seem like great quality.  Especially for about $60 a piece.  I gave 2 stars because our waiter was a nice guy.  We also order the bruschetta app which wasn't good at all.  Definitely nothing like Italian places back in NY.",

    "text": "Views-great, staff-friendly, food...meh. The biggest problem I had was a few days before the reservation I called to ask if they had a decent vegetarian options or if it was just like one item. She assured me over the phone that they had an \"extensive selection\" and to go online to their menu to see. They did have several options which was great to meet certain diets. When we arrived a lot of the menu was different, the waiter said that they recently changed the menu and he didn't know why some of the options we asked them if they still had were even showing on the menu. Guess what, there was now only one vegetarian option! It was really disappointing, this was a special occasion, and wanted to make sure my partner enjoyed themselves too but unfortunately set a lackluster mood. We would have gone elsewhere if I had known there was only one thing to choose from and the side of seasonal vegetables we paid to add on was about the size of my fist. The food really is kinda subpar which is a shame for how romantic and elegant the atmosphere is.  The Pumpkin risotto did not taste of pumpkin at all, it was more \"flowery\" tasting. The Chicken breast was good but small, the \"creamed Leeks\" weren't really edible, left me hungry for more literally. The views pushed it over the 3 star mark and the staff really were very friendly and on top of their game, drinks were quickly refilled, plates cleared and no question was too small or a hassle.  They did do a great job of making the anniversary itself feel special by congratulating us several times, it was nice. We were able to choose our deserts and comped us for our anniversary which was really really nice of them. Better than some places that just give you some small generic thing. I don't think the food was worth the price, the views are and I'd definitely love to return.",

The place is nice the view is great the let down was our waitress she was very rude with us she did not offer us a starting plate or appetizer we had to ask her once we placed our order the tables next to us where offered. Also I heard a couple happy birthday cheers and a song we where not offered that nor where we offered a deserts menu I wanted to get her a small slice of cake or something for her bday what a let down. Paid over $100 for this bad service. On a side note the guy serving the water and cleaning the tables was very kind and nice to us always with a smile! Unlike the waitress who would not even speak to us at times when serving the food and stuff. The food was good!",

    "text": "Remarkably exceptional customer service!!! Firstly, my boyfriend made Valentine's Day dinner reservations for us at 9:00, we arrived early at 8:35 and were ready to wait the 25 minutes to be seated but it didn't take any longer than 10 to get our table, which was very nice.   We sit down and get a menu with a preset 4 course meal for Valentine's Day that we weren't aware of before making the reservations, and at $80 a person for the 4 course meal when we only intended on each getting a $20-$30 entree, we both almost had a heart attack. We asked our waiter if it was possible to only order the entree, and he returned politely and apologetically saying since it was all preset we couldn't. We then asked to speak to the manager, and after explaining to him that we're just 18 years old and weren't expecting to order anything over $30 the manager replied saying that it was their fault, that they should have called us after making the reservation to tell us about the preset menu, then he told us not to worry about it, it was all on him. Both my boyfriend and I tried explaining to him that that wasn't necessary at all and we would be completely fine with just paying for an entree and the manager was exceptionally nice enough to tell us even though it's not necessary he wanted to take care of the entire 4 course meal for each of us, on the house.   I would have never in a million years expect such a high class restaurant to have employees and managers with so much respect for mere 18 year olds, I was absolutely blown away by the level of customer service at this establishment, it's unlike anywhere else. Our experience here at the Compass Grill was genuinely one I will never forget, it's absolutely amazing.   Besides the inspiring customer service, the food was great and the view is beautiful, they were able to accommodate my vegetarianism by turning each of the 4 courses vegetarian, which was very much appreciated and unexpected, and my boyfriend loved the meat dishes he got with smoked duck empanada and his main course filet.   We've been raving about this place to everyone ever since our Valentine's Day experience and we will definitely return, maybe for graduation dinner or an anniversary. I wish I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars, I'd recommend it to anyone. Thank you so much for your generosity, Compass Grill!",

    "text": "Wow! What an amazing dining experience here at The Compass Arizona Grill at the Hyatt Downtown Phoenix! Everyone from the hostesses to the servers assistant to the server were phenomenal! Hostesses Miranda and Cari were so sweet (as always!), David was very polite and professional, and our server, Maria was an absolute joy and True expert in her profession. She was friendly but not intrusive, knowledgeable, and showed that she enjoys what she does. She offered wonderful selections for us, she gave me a sampling of different wines to choose from to accompany my perfect filet mignon. And the chefs...Bravo! Even though I was not particularly a fan of the Blue Corn Calamari (I wasn't exactly expecting what had come out), I did appreciate and enjoy their take on the popular dish as it was more like a southwestern salad with the Blue Corn Calamari, Arugula, corn, and dressing decorating the plate beneath. THE BRIE FONDUE.....I could nosh on that for days! Creamy, smooth, perfect taste with their Noble Bread. Sweet, salty, savory all in one. It's a must. The Filet Mignon was cooked to a perfect temperature. Silky, full flavor, and just...wow. We did order dessert to go and haven't had a chance to dig in, but we did order the Black & White Cake...and I can safely assume it will be just as delicious!  I almost forgot the piece de resistance! You're on top of the city with 360 view of Downtown Phoenix. That's right folks, it's a ROTATING restaurant! One full rotation take roughly an hour (expect at least 1.5-2 hours for a full relaxing/enjoyable meal -yes they do validate for up to 2 hours!). Although we only had two full rotations, it felt as if we went around 4 times! If you get motion sickness, don't worry- you really don't feel the movement at all, and they do offer seating away from the window, but not too far that you don't get a beautiful view.",

She rushed us in ordering, coming to our table five different times to ask us if we were ready to order, while we were enjoying the view and our bottle of wine.   The food isn't great. Overpriced and just not with it. I had the roasted chicken and it was tasteless and boring.   Probably won't be coming back. This place is a one time stop; go for the view but save your money.",

Ordered Hennessy on the rocks, and man they fill that bad boy up, only needed that one drink for the evening. That's PLUS! Ordered the Ribeye, with Brussel sprouts, wow! Ribeye was cooked perfect. Medium rare. Brussel sprouts weren't over cooked or burnt, just right, with caramelized onions. My favorite part is that you don't even realize the restaurant is spinning, that you get a 360 degree view of the city. Highly recommend to check out. It's a bit pricey, next time I'll just order the Hennessy on the rocks, with a burger for a cheap night, with a great view.",

The crust is hard on the bread, but the middle is warm and soft. Some people don't like the hard outside, but I thought it was okay. I ordered the chicken and my husband ordered the steak. Very, very small portions. He was still hungry so we ordered more bread AND I shared my chicken with him (which was also a very, very small portion) to help fill him up. He did say the streak was DELICIOUS and perfectly tender (his steak was prepared medium), but the portion was much smaller than the size of his fist. The \"sides\" that they come with are not big either so don't show up starving, unless you plan on getting lots of appetizers before dinner. Overall, decent, but there are lots of restaurants that have better food and bigger portions for much, much less money, but probably not the same view and ambiance.",

    "text": "As a kid, I always thought this place spun super fast like an amusement park ride. As a grown-up, I was disappointed to find out it doesn't, but happy to find out there are some great happy hour deals here.  Happy hour is kind of at a weird time (9pm to 11pm), bu it's still one of my favorites. Happy hour features $5 desserts, $5 Canvas Wine (5oz of Chardonnay, Merlot, or Cabernet), $5 Wells, and $7 Featured Signature Cocktails.  I'm not a big fan of dessert, but I have yet to have a dessert here that I didn't like. The Strawberry Shortcake tasted exactly like a Strawberry Good Humor Bar... in other words it was amazing! The Chocolate Tort and Dulce de Leche were also delicious.   Obviously, the view is amazing. It's great to go at sunset, even though there's no happy hour prices. The best part of the amazing view... it distracts from the terribly outdated interior decor. You definitely notice that you're eating in a hotel restaurant.   I've also had some hit/miss experiences with the service. On my first visit, the waiter was nice, but awkward, and brought us the check as soon as he brought us our drinks. If I'm paying over $10 a drink (it wasn't HH yet), at least let me enjoy it before you shove the bill in my face. On another visit, someone in our party told the hostess we just wanted to sit in the bar, and she quickly snapped, \"Um, the bar is downstairs. We don't have a bar. Unless you want to sit in the lounge.\" The \"lounge\" looked exactly like the rest of the place except with an uglier tables and chairs. If you're going to be snooty, you better have something to be snooty about.  Still, for an amazing view, $5 wines, and $5 desserts, there's no place better than the Compass Room.",

My husband ordered the roasted chicken entree and I went for the south western ceased salad. Both of the dishes were sad and disappointing in taste, chicken was too dry abc over cooked. We had ordered chicken fingers and fries for our son and they somehow mixed up the order and got something totally different (grilled chicken and veggies) where chicken was again over cooked and dry. I had to ask extra dressing for my salad as it was just plain lettuce and Parmesan cheese. Overall the food experience was unpleasant but the service was good. They offered us completely dessert, I had lost my appetite till then.  Overall a very costly affair just to enjoy the view and sunset. Food totally not worth it.",

Last night (7:00 pm reservation for Jim Deem, party of 4), we came to your establishment to show our visitors from Utah the City, and to have an excellent meal.  While the view was great, the meal was not so much.  My wife had the Braised short ribs - found a huge piece of fat in the meat, very unappetizing, while the rest of the flavor was fine.  What was not good was when we went home - she spent the bulk of the night on the toilet.  I had the small filet and again the flavor and the house sauce was great, but as soon as I got home it was a fight for the bathroom.  Our other two guests had no complaints.  The other thing I'm sure you know is that it was so noisy, it was difficult to have conversation. I share all of this with the hope that you will check it out and help insure that others don't have the experience that we had.  You are welcome to contact me if you wish further info.  I will not go back, nor will I encourage others to go there!!!",

Perfect way to have celebrated my anniversary! The staff was fantastic, it took a little bit to have someone at our table so I was a little nervous but soon enough our server came very apologetically so all was well. It had a modern warm interior and our table in their kind of sunken area around the windows was VERY comfortable. Fantastic cocktails from their lounge (we took a ride share, don't drink and drive!) APPETIZERS! Calamari was delicious cooked with peppers and served with an aioli sauce and a strawberry jalapeno sauce looked like a jam to me and I don't like Jams so I didn't try it, my partner said it complimented the peppers on the calamari very well. We debated on a second entree but decided on another cocktail instead (a liquid appetizer) ENTREE my partner had the 16oz ribeye he said he could have used it a little more pink for mid rare but loved it. My 6oz filet was great and cooked perfectly, melted in my mouth. Bacon and brie Mac and cheese am I dreaming? Very rich but incredibly savory. Mexican street corn with paprika and lime cream very good! Let's be sure to address the best part of compass THE VIEW! Incredible view of the valley luckily we came on a weekend to avoid that lovely brown smog that lingers over our city. Highly recommend!",

It felt like a completely different atmosphere from our hotel room just a few floors below, stepping out of those elevator doors and feeling like Cinderella being escorted across the red carpet",

We just missed the sunset, but the view was still very nice - filled with the skyline and lights. It was a bit chilly while eating there, so definitely bring something to cover up!   For drinks, we ordered the William Hill cab (I thoroughly enjoyed this) and the sparking raz. For an appetizer, we ordered the calamari, which was a little underwhelming as it wasn't served with the normal aioli or cocktail sauce and the portion. I would say pass on ordering this appetizer. For entrees, we ordered the shrimp capellini pasta and the ribeye off of the summer menu with the additions of creamed corn and the pork-braised greens. The ribeye was pretty disappointing - it was cooked medium rare but still tough. One thing I do know is that you must order the pork-braised greens. I think that was honestly the highlight of the food selections.   Overall, the service was very friendly but the food was a little disappointing especially for the price point. The rotating restaurant concept was pretty cool, but I'd definitely only come back for drinks and the view.",

    "text": "We had a bit of challenge in getting a reservation on a Saturday night. When I called, I was told there were no available tables. Then I tried making an on-line reservation: Success!   The Compass Arizona Grill, like the Hyatt, is somewhat retro. Do they even build revolving restaurants anymore? It really seems like something from the 60s or 70s.   Not sure it is something I would want to do every Saturday night. But it was a good way to relax after a day of traveling. We had more than a full revolution and had a good view of downtown Phoenix -- plus the sunset.  We began our meal with a bottle of cabernet sauvignon and a bread basket which featured two seeded buns and three mini loaves of cornbread. Butter and honey butter were good complements. DH thoroughly enjoyed his entree: three small beef medallions with a side of roasted brussels sprouts. I ordered one of the specials: a Moroccan dish with couscous and peppers, topped with mahi mahi. Sounded intriguing. The portion of fish was quite large -- I had to push myself to finish it. For me, chicken or lamb would have been a better choice than the fish. The couscous was a bit on the cool side and didn't have much of a \"zip\" to it -- needed more spices.  We ended our meal with a delicious cherry tart served with vanilla ice cream. It was quite lovely ... not too tart, not too sweet. The generous portion was perfect for sharing.  Jacob was our server ... helpful, yet not overly intrusive. All in all Compass Arizona Grill was a good option. Worth trying at least once when in Phoenix.",

We watched both gigantic sports stadiums being built below us and have even caught a local haboob (giant dust storm)  boiling up from the south.  Little kids could go if they are really well-behaved (it's a quiet setting), and teens will think it's cool.  Grandparents and great-grandparents love it!

What breaks it for me was the service. Waitress came to the table and said nothing. And then couldn't politely answer my question about beverages because they are no where on the menu, and then came later to take our order and then went off on a seafood dish out of nowhere. Also, I made reservations a day before and got there and still had to wait. How does that make sense?",

The reason I was hesitant is because it's a little overpriced for the food quality and selection but in the end you are paying a bit for the view and the experience.   The food was good, but nothing was great, and the portions are small.  I shared a calamari appetizer, had the salmon, and we shared a dessert and I still wasn't full when we left. I even had a few of their amazing cornbread concoctions.   Good but not great, I would recommend going once for a special occasion to see if you like it. We made a reservation about 30 min before sunset so the views were great and we got to watch the sunset. Once the sun goes down, the views aren't nearly as worth it.",

I mean completely ignored us on several occasions and seemed irritated one of the members of our party was late and then was pissy and acted like we were a waste of his time the rest of the meal. Took an excruciating long time to get our food. Pork belly tostadas were good because its bacon, but the bacon was overcooked and were more like bacon croutons on two itty bitty tacos. Our medium rare steaks  ended up being medium well and needed more seasoning. Brussel sprouts were not fully cooked but must have been put in the broiler as the inside was raw and the outside burned.

We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and experience as this was our first time dining here. All of the staff were very nice and friendly. I had filet mignon and it was seasoned very well, he had the scallops and loved it. We also had dessert. Now he got the gelato, super yummy and I had the apple cobbler. I have had a lot of apple pie, apple cobbler, ok, I've had a lot of apple desserts and can I just say this was really good but the one thing that I didn't like and it kind of ruined it for me is they leave the peeling on the apple. In my opinion the cobbler would have been perfection if they peeled the apples before making the cobbler. Other than that we enjoyed the food and view of the city. Thank you for a memorable evening.",

The dining area rotates - one full rotation takes one hour - giving you a 360 view of Downtown Phoenix.   Between two, we shared the roasted beet caprese, house spring salad, pork belly tostada, lobster bisque, and the red snapper special. The flavors of everything, except the pork belly were a little off.   Burrata sat at the center of the plate, topped with arugula, roasted beets, and with what I think was supposed to be an olive oil drizzle, but was more of a pool. Beet caprese was an oily, mushy, glob of confusion. The lobster bisque was a bowl of extra watery fishyness. And for the red snapper special, it was literally a piece of flavorless grilled fish.   I gotta say though, the pork belly was pretty good. Pork belly was braised, cooked well, and had a nice bold, spiced onion taste.   If you're looking for a romantic date night with the views, this is the spot, but don't expect anything from the food.",

Wine selection is ummm Wal-Mart wines at x6 prices. I was disappointed with their limited selections, I just expected more from a place like this.   Price: slightly more than what you'd expect. More than mastros. Food: appearance is fancy AF, taste is yummy but nothing to dream about later. Brie appetizer was great, dessert was both interesting and delicious. We got the creme brulee very sweet but worth it.  Service: you get a server and a helper.  All very attentive.  People: a mix of dressed up love birds having a romantic dinner and very casual hotel guests who want to party cause they're on vacation. You can wear whatever you want which again makes the tab seem over priced at the end there.   I would take guests here but I probably won't be celebrating another anniversary or birthday here.",

    "text": "Dined tonight, 11-14-17, which is a Tuesday. To start with I'd give the flexibility of the server 5 stars, but this experience left much to be desired. Me and my coworkers are staying at the Hyatt, and wanted to have a nice meal together while we are here on training and away from our multi state homes. We chose this restaurant as it's in the hotel, it's 24th floor in downtown Phoenix and I think over 1 hour you can see the whole city.   The pricing is up there, and looks wise it's nice looking, but it's not super fancy either. Being a large group and all needing separate checks, the server was flexible about this, so again 5 stars. It's also in his best interest because it's automatic 18% gratuity if you are a party of 6 or more, and with the price being higher, our table alone was almost $100 in tips, so I can't add stars to this experience, plus it was a Tuesday and not super busy either.   Tonight some of coworkers didn't arrive by 6:45PM, so we decided to go ahead and get our orders in, as we were all hungry. I ordered a 1LB Rib Eye which comes with 1 side ($9 ea - ala carte) for $50.  Our food took a VERY LONG TIME to come out, they were 8 of us, I ordered mine rare it came out a perfect rare. 2 other people ordered steaks and both of there's was overcooked. The flavor of the steak was okay, besides being cooked a perfect rare, nothing exciting about the taste.   Where the big failure for me was the brussel sprouts. He asked if I like them charred, which I said I did. There were charred but with a super sweet demi glaze sauce, they were so coated and gross, I couldn't only get down a couple. If you like brussel this is like a kid version that might appeal to child's taste buds, but not if your an adult who actually likes them! As Gordon Ramsay would say, \"I would not feed them to my DOG!\" They were cooked terribly too, boiled, and charred sweet saucy black messes. Overall, for these kind of prices, this food was a TOTAL  it's a total fail, I would give 1 star if the server wasn't flexible and nice.    So this restaurant rotates, and I quickly got seasick, it's sound really cool, but I hated dining there. I was dizzy and just uncomfortable often watching everything move just enough that you had to trick your brain to not see it, then you would again, I even put my back to the view within 1 minute of looking out, which obviously didn't help. If you want a view, just get a room on the top floor of the Hyatt, order to go, and dine in the room!   Getting checked out was a long process and I do give credit to the flexibility of the server, but it was 1-2 checks at time, just not great process. I was dizzy and just wanted to leave. I left about 8:45PM so this was a 2 hour dining experience from ordering. I would never dine here again. The only good news is our company will reimburse the meal + 18% gratuity, THANKFULLY!",

Tried this place over 20 years ago and it was great....this past weekend after a long drive from San Diego.....I must say $300.00 later I feel taken to the cleaners.

I had the salmon with kale. It was quite bland for my taste. I've had the steak before and it was a much better choice. I'd recommend this restaurant  for a special occasion and if you've never been there before. We went on a Friday night, it's low key and a \"tame\"environment. Definitely not for those who are looking for a more vivacious atmosphere.",

The small garden salad was terrific. I let the server know about my dairy and egg sensitivities, she helped me navigate the menu. I ended up with the salmon and brussel sprouts. The sprouts were the best I have ever had. Wish we had time to stay for dessert, but we were headed across the street to a concert. The only draw back was the time it took to get the food. The server mentioned we should order quickly since the restaurant was getting really busy. We did, but it still took a while. We got there at 5:45 and didn't get out until after 7. Can't wait to go back again one day, I'll add a little more buffer for time next time. The views are great. The sun can be intense but it moves along quickly enough that you aren't in it for too long. I recommend this!",

I was undecided between steak or the sea bass and my server suggested the sea bass. What an excellent choice! It was wonderful. Cooked perfectly with excellent flavor. I accompanied this with a Michael Mondavi chardonnay which complimented the meal well. Why 4 and not 5? Wine list and spirit offerings could be a lot better. Very limited to basic spirits and the wines could vary a bit more. Otherwise this restaurant is excellent.",

The service was nice and when we first got there it was early enough it was still pretty empty.  Our first issue was that the item we wanted to order that we had seen on the web site menu wasn't available.  My girlfriend ordered one of the only other vegetarian items and it ended up being nothing as described.  It's first ingredient was eggplant but it only had a very paper thin layer of eggplant on the top.    The food was OK at the time, but both my girlfriend and I were pretty sick within an hour or two of eating there.  We would have given two stars but the endless bread was good and they got an extra star for that.",

Gelato and the chocolate flourless cake. We requested a candle ( we were celebrating a big birthday), regrettably they did not accommodate. The bill for 4 and 2 glasses of prosecco was over 3 bills.

This seems like a huge miss on the restaurants part. The black and white cake was dry with no flavor so we took one bite and left. This is rare for us not to finish anything sweet. We were the only people in the place since it opened early for the final four. Could not reserve on open table but did on yelp and it would only let us do 5:30 even though a hotel manager told us it would open at 5. I went to the hotel concierge to update our time but was told I would have to call once they opened because the concierge can not make reservations at the restaurant in the hotel. He also was not aware it was opening early. If I was a concierge I would call myself or use yelp myself for the customer if the hotel did not empower me to help a guest. Mind you he was not at valet or doing anything else. the elevator also did not work at 5pm so we had to get engineering to help us get up to the restaurant. seems like the hotel does not have good communication or customer service so just keep that in mind if you want to check this place out.",

Isn't it bad enough that last call on Saturday night is at 10:15 without being rude to your customers?  So whatever, we told her there we six of us and I spied these really cool lounge pits sunken into the floor and lined with luxurious couches. Hell yes, it's my birthday and I am dressed to the nines so I want the James Bond fancy couch pit.  Well not so fast, instead the hostess walks us to a table which I can only describe as something you might see sitting on someones porch holding up a fancy potted plant. So I point to the empty couch area and ask if we can sit there. She starts dragging chairs over to this tiny table and says \"This is the lounge area.\" To which I reply \"Right, well it's my birthday and I want to sit over there.\" (Mind you the place is empty except for another group of about 4 or 5 SITTING IN ANOTHER ONE OF THE COUCH PITS.)  She just replies back \"This is the lounge area.\" My  group reluctantly starts sitting down but I decided that since we were in walking distance of a zillion other bars and restaurants we should just leave. I announced to the group \"Lets go somewhere else, I'm out, eff the Compass Room\". Then I turned and walked right to the elevator.  As my group hurried to catch up the manager followed me to the elevator to tell me I had to leave while a waitress told my boyfriend I was clearly a no-serve. Yeah, okay \"eff the Compass Room\" is strong language but I was LEAVING. You can't kick me out, I am leaving. And no, I'm not drunk, just offended at the poor customer service and rude hostess. If you wont seat me where I want to be seated when you bar is DEAD and I have money to spend then I have every right to leave.  What a lame experience. Thumbs down for sure. No wonder no one ever goes there.",

Neither open table or the restaurant website mention that they validate hotel parking--so dont park anywhere but the hotel.   We were greeted three times at the host station before we were seated, which wasn't bad just weird. The table setting and dining room ambiance is strictly hotel standard--don't expect to wow anyone with that. Tired maroon cloth napkins. Horrible lacquer table tops. The average age in the place was definitely high sixties. The view however was awesome. And the rotation was slow enough to be peaceful and fast enough to keep it exciting.  The service was extremely awkward. It was like a symphony of the socially inept. It felt like the wait staff at Denny's somehow got their big break and had a five minute crash course in \"fine dining\" and ran with it. There were no specials, which was a red flag for me. And the first round of drinks came in glasses that were so water spotted and gross, I was embarrassed for the server. The martinis were watery and tiny. The food was acceptable but entirely unremarkable and overpriced. Pass on the NY steak if you are expecting anything thick.  This is definitely a second stop, beer/wine only place. Skip the food, skip the cocktails. Pre drink someplace else, show up here, sip beer or a bottle of wine [I would not trust a by the glass here] while you spin and get your parking validation.",

When in Rome....or something.  I ordered some curry chicken thing and my nieces had grilled cheese off the kids menu.  we also ordered a molten cake for dessert but there was no molten? whatever, no need to to hash it because i knew going in the food sorta sucks.   Our bill was $70 but we seriously had a blast. The whole dinner was filled with gasps and excitement and sheer thrill about how fun this restaurant was.",

We heard about the Super Moon and though there would be no better place to view it than from high above Phoenix.  We were lucky to get a reservation hours before.   The staff at Compass was terrific.  The hostesses at the front were extremely friendly and enjoyed viewing the Super Moon also. We were quickly seated and served a chili corn bread that is fantastic. They do give you the recipe upon request. Our dinner,, we both had steak, was very good, but also very pricey.  Yes you do pay for the view.  I must say this was a great experience.  This is a great restaurants for special occasions.",

To my surprise it was a fine dining restaurant, with a SPECTACULAR VIEW, and service was great/enjoyable (Patty was so upbeat and a great server in general). The atmosphere set it apart from any place I had been to before. Perfect for a romantic night with my girlfriend or a place to celebrate a special occasion with friends. Beyond the atmosphere and great view, the food was delicious. I had the NY strip and it was cooked just right. Everything from our appetizer to dessert was so good. Even the bread, which was a jalapeno cornbread, was great. Although it is pretty pricey, it's definitely worth the money.",

She also told our client that her daughter had better not go into the other hotel venues and they would be watching her. This is unacceptable behavior. Our waitresses (Lindsey and one other woman) were very nice however. Yay on the food and waitresses but screw the management.

Originally had tried to get in on Saturday night but they were booked till 8:00 so agreed to do Sunday.  When we arrived hostess tried to sit us in table and not in booth as we requested when I said I would wait they seamed a little put off by this...even though there were numerous booths available she said she would have to clean it and it would be about 10 minutes...I agreed this was OK and just thought it was not like they were packed and should be more accommodating when there were more seats available.

As for the food it is a little pricey but your definitely paying for the view and being that the restaurant spins you get to see the entire city . Definitely a great date night you can't go wrong , they also validate parking so be sure to do that before you leave.",

The Compass was located on top of the Hyatt Regency and provided a 360 degree view of the Valley .... in what I understand to be the only revolving roof-top restaurant in Arizona.   Our visit to the Compass was on a Friday night about 6:00 pm, just after the Thursday Thanksgiving holiday. The place was not that busy but it was early and most folks were probably full & at home (& not ready to go out for dinner) after the big meal many had the day before.  After getting off the elevator, we were quickly shown to our table that was next to a window ...... that provided a specular view of the city. We did not know much about this place when making reservations. It took us a few minutes to notice that the view outside was changing due to the slow rotation. What a great visual perspective this venue provides. We later learn that it takes just over 1 hour to complete one revolution letting you enjoy so much of the Phoenix area during that period.   The wait staff was very good - professional and efficient. I appreciated the way the various servers covered for one another to help ensure every tables' needs were met quickly.    We started with wine and sparkling water. I chose a B.R.Cohn Cabernet from Kenwood, CA and my best friend ordered a Franciscan Napa Chardonnay. Our salads choices were the same - the Southwest Caesar with Heirloom Tomato, Manchego and Noble Cumin Croutons. Very nice variation on the traditional Caesar - I liked it a lot. The small (versus large) portion salad was most generous.    For the main meal, my wife ordered the Braised Lamb Shank which she liked .... Even the corn polenta and she is typically not a polenta fan. My salmon was disappointing. It was very much over cooked, consequently dry and the crust fell off the fish as it was served. We did not have time to return it to the kitchen (but I should have at least complained). Anyway, I would not recommend the fish --- based on this one experience.  We opted for expresso and brandy ... for dessert. A triple shot kept me going for the evening.",

    "text": "I had really high hopes for this place.  I was in town for a conference and wanted to meet up with a friend who now lives down here.  He said he could meet me at my hotel, which I was staying at the Hyatt Regency just below this restaurant with a fantastic location, set-up and view.  What better to do than to get us a reservation, which was pretty easy to do, the lady on the phone was really nice, and come up here for some food, drinks, enjoy the view and catch up.  Like I said, I wanted to like this place, but the service fell very short.  It took a minute to be seated, and we got a great window seat where you can see for miles around in every direction as the restaurant slowly turns round and round.  I should have known something was wrong as the couple seated next to us (and after us) had their orders taken and their drinks arrive before we got our menus.  After taking our order it took quite a long time for us to get our food (and drinks... the easy part).  Once we got our food, our waitress disappeared.  She was no where to be found.  I asked someone for a drink refill and was told I would have to ask my waitress.  I finally asked again and their response was, \"did you ask your waitress?\"  I said i still haven't seen her...  There are now two employees, who could have been taking care of other customers, looking for our waitress.  By the time she was found and returned to our table I was done.  We wanted to order another side and perhaps dessert, and get more drinks but I was done.  She said something about the kitchen being busy...  I asked her to just get my check, she didn't seem to thrilled but finally brought it back. As for the food, I had the filet which was pretty good.  The food and view were great, but for the price I definitely need better service.  We also met earlier in the evening and the restaurant was not close to full yet.  If I am back in the area, I probably wouldn't risk paying for poor service again.  I got to experience it once, see the view and catch up.  I'd rather try my luck elsewhere.",

Not being able to eat gluten I haven't been able to eat fried calamari in years. This was the first time I've seen blue masa calamari. The shrimp cocktail was ok. It has a very strong citrus flavor which my family didn't like at all. It actually kind of ruined the flavor of the seafood itself. My daughter and I split a filet and potatoes. The filet had a great taste. The vegetables were pretty undercooked and under flavored.  My four year old ordered the petit steaks off the kids meal and the steaks had an odd taste. They had a strange spice to them, seemed like they had way too much pepper on them. Our waiter was nice but there was a young guy helping the waiter who was named David. He was amazing.  He should be waiting his own tables, not just helping. He anticipates your needs and seems very proactive.   The view of course was great and the kids loved that it rotated and you could see all the different parts of the city.",

Our waiter took forever to greet us or give us water so i asked an employee passing by for some bread and she replied unhelpfully that we need to order an entree in order to receive bread.  Dennys has better service than this joint.  Our slow server finally arrived and he never told us what the special was for that night.  I asked and he said it was some type of fish.  I asked if it came w anything else and he replies, \" just some vegetables\".  Omg, the scallop plate is like $39 (which was delish) but the wait staff education and service needs to match the cost per plate we are paying.  I swear dennys has better service!  Thumbs down!

No apology or explanation was given. The Chicken on the Salad was very dry and there was no dressing on the salad. The other entrees were moderately acceptable but a poor representation of what should be served at these prices. As the room rotated it also became increasingly colder. Other fine dining restaurants offer much better food and great views in the Valley. First time to try this place after living here for many decades. Very disappointing overall. Sadly, I would not recommend this place.",

Reasons for scores: (a) Food is a 7, salad fresh, shrimp pasta my friend ordered very tasty and generous portion; be sure to ask for the free cheesy corn bread appetizers and garlic bread sticks. (b) Service 8, server was attentive, smiling, friendly; (c) Speed of service; 10 very good, food and beverage order taken within about 5 minutes after being seated, food arrived within 10 minutes; (d) View, the best, 10 10 10, it's all about the 360 view of the city and surrounding area from the 24th floor, during daylight you can see the entire region, during the evening, the city lights are beautiful; go even if just for the view, although the only way to see the view is to be seated in the restaurant, so you will need to order food or appetizers at least; (e) Seating in the restaurant booths comfortable on a scale of 7, slightly padded chairs, but no high-backs in the booths, and most tables just use chairs; seating in the \"lounge\" earns a score of 4, it has the taller tables for standing or sitting at bar height, not as comfortable as the restaurant, lounge tables hard wood with no backing or arm rests on the chairs, more like a sports bar amenities; apparently they don't want you to get too comfortable; We sat in the lounge on my last visit there and I couldn't wait to leave; I rushed the waiter to bring the to-go-boxes and check. (f) Temperature was freezing cold; this was my 4th visit to this restaurant within 2 years and it has ALWAYS been freezing cold, as in shivering during the entire meal; I called the manager the day after the 1st visit and let them know my complaint and they said there was a problem with the air conditioning and they were working on, but I don't believe that because it was the same each visit. Next time I go (remember, the view is unbelievably beautiful, especially for visiting friends from out-of-town), I will wear winter socks and closed-toe shoes or ankle boots and a winter-weight blazer or sweater, a lightweight silk neck-scarf, possibly even fingerless gloves. The reason I gave a total score of 4 stars above is mostly because of the temperature and the management's apparent lack of concern about it or inability or unwillingness to fix it. I looked through other reviews and read other people also commenting about it, so it wasn't just me having a hot flash (never had one) all 4 times I've been there; it's the coldest restaurant I have EVER been in; I'm thinking maybe 65 degrees.",

    "text": "First off, I'd like to say this restaurant was the most Romantic and unique restaurant that I've tried so far!   First time here. I was staying at the hotel which is the Hyatt  regency, and asked the concierge for a really good nice classy restaurant within the area. He recommended Compass and said that it was well known for being a\"revolving restaurant \" hence the name Compass. I said cool,  I've never been to a revolving restaurant before so i made a reservation for a party of  3 on a Friday night.  I went up to the 24th for where it was located and my oh my, boy was it stunning!  Literally when you come out the elevator,  you see the hostess on the left and the magnificent view. It reminded me a little bit of a new York view. That view at night with tall lighted buildings. The were a couple of sofas while you wait. It was packed though omg. I said thank God i called for a reservation hours ahead of time!  So we stepped into the restaurant itself and just when i thought i couldn't be more impressed,  i was. The place was incredibly charming and cozy. We were seated at a very comfortable booth. Our waiter was so wonderful and polite.   For starters , we  were served these  little amazing cornbreads! Soo so good. They tasted like ikea ones but Better and gourmet. the waiter recommended some surf and turf combo which sounded delicious till we almost choked when we asked for the price. We ended up ordering for entrees two of the pan seared chicken with smoked cheddar grits and roast vegetables and seared sablefish with sweet potato mash and maple balsamic syrup.  Food was presented beautifully and it tasted amazing. My sablefish was so soft. It tasted light and healthy. I took a taste of the chicken with grits and it was gooooood. We didn't order any desserts because we were stuffed from eating so much cornbread.  Overall, it was awesome. The whole experience definitely felt special, it really was. The ambiance, the service, the food, the rotating view! Everything. The price was definitely worth paying for. Especially great for anniversary and stuff.   I will most definitely be coming back and recommend! Awesome restaurant.",

We started with a fondue that came with the hardest piece of bread on earth.  If you want great fondue, Arrogant Butcher has a great one with warm soft pretzel bread.  I ordered the Sea Bass and my buddy ordered a steak.  Let just say that I have eaten better fish at a Sizzler.  I do not know what happen, but the fish was almost as hard as my bread.  Definitely cooked well well well done and dry.  My buddy's steak was ordered medium rare and you probably already guessed how it came out, well done.  I worked at a restaurant and did not send mine back, but my buddy is from Canada and he sent his steak back.  Well guess what the second one came out the same, well done.  So he just ate it.  There are a lot more places in downtown to choose from for a great dinner.....but not the Compass Grill at the Hyatt.  Thx!",

The experience is really nice if you get to the restaurant as the sun is setting ~ very romantic. The food to me wasn't anything special that you can't get the same or better at a local BJ's which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I also think the food is way to overpriced for what you get, I was satisfied, but not full, especially for a meal close to $50 a person. Because I only went in a party of 2, the experience was lovely, although for some parties greater than 2, I noticed their experience wasn't as nice. Their tables aren't large to begin with so if you come in a party greater than 4, you'll most likely have to be split up, which isn't what you want especially if you're gathering together to celebrate something. It was a nice experience to have, but I think this is one of those restaurants where you're fine with just trying once or twice!",

The problem, though, is the service and the food. We were a larger party of about 10; however, it took forever to get drinks and bread although the butter had been sitting on the table for a good 45 mins before the bread arrived. I got the crab cake and mash and it was def not worth the price. I also overheard others in my group state that their food was just \"ok\". Again, you pay for the view here. Not the quality of food. A cool experience based on ambiance, but somewhat disappointed due to lack of prompt service and blah food.",

We had 4 in our party and hoped to be able to enjoy the cuisine (and did we mention the incredible view) for as long as possible.  And we did!!

This is the first time I have seen him send food back. They corrected it, but nothing was done to compensate us for his dinner being 15 minutes after ours. The waitress was nice, but she either didn't mention the problems to the manager or he didnt care, because nobody ever came around and asked about our experience.

And we all know how fun that is.  So the shtick of this place is this: it's a restaurant on a relatively tall building in downtown Phoenix that spins, thus giving you a 360 degree view of the area around the hotel.   But it spins just a tad too fast. You can hear and feel the gears of the place going, oftentimes creaking in certain areas. The central wall is painted one boring color of baby-crap brown and there's nothing on it but a hand rail (really?!) that looks like a relic from the 70s.  And it was freezing! Uncomfortable so.   The food was good. I had the salmon entree and it was delicious. Wonderfully cooked and a large portion. The appetizer was a pain in the ass. It was a pizza with cheese and mushrooms and truffle and so tasty, but the crust was too flimsy to hold the toppings, but cutting it was awkward and the share plates were too small. And there ain't no way I'm dropping oily mushrooms on this dress I'm wearing. I gave it up after the first slice.   Overall, a weird experience. The place was practically empty on a Friday night and because the room is curved you can hear mystery voices of people you can't see... Can they hear me?!  Even though I liked the dinner... I won't be back. Spinning around twice was enough for me.  FYI- one rotation is almost exactly an hour long. And Arizona is damn boring more than once.",

Never had an empty water, never left waiting for long.   The only complaint on service was pre-bussing. I don't want to stare at my bread and butter plates until dessert, and I want my empty cocktail glass gone. (All were pushed to the edge of the table, too)    Also, the food was somewhat dissapointing. We both ordered the filet mignon. Nice size, cooked well. However, it was absolutely horrifying. Crusted in cappucino? No, just no. I figured it would be subtle, but I felt like I took a piece of steak and rolled it in a coffee filter full of ground coffee. I did my best to scrape it off, but it was completely penetrated. We both ate them, not wanting to cause a scene. I suggest you request the filet without the cappuccino crust. You'll thank me later.     Dessert was great, we ordered the banana cannoli. This was the best part of the meal. It successfully got the awful taste of dinner out of our mouths.

Very old school and delicious. Our waitress Sheryl, was so professional, knowledgeable, and kind. We always order calamari wherever we go and use it as a barometer. It was delicious, tender and lightly crispy. YUM! They brought us moist and warm cornbread. I ordered the lobster chowder and sea bass. Wow! It looks like small portions but, no. We were stuffed! My husband ordered the wedge salad and top sirloin. I'm telling you, GO there!  Prices are high but worth every penny in quality, service, ambiance, and city views. We'll be back!",

My first time visiting the compass grill, my boyfriend surprised me with a nice dinner with my promotion at work, absolutely fell in love with the food and ambiance, enjoyed scallops and red snapper with pork belly and risotto, what a treat. We promised each other we would go back for 4th of July and watch the fireworks. We called and made reservations but they were booked, well the day of the 4th, they called and had a spot for us, yay!! Well looking over the fireworks and enjoying crab cakes and some wine, My boyfriend got down on one knee and proposed and it was very intimate and special. The staff were so accommodating with complimentary champagne and dessert. This is our go to special place. :-)",

There was even an Arizona Diamondbacks game that had just ended and there were fireworks to end the night. It made the night even more romantic. Our server Lindsey was even better than the views. She was so sweet and answered all of our questions. She even told us about some fun places to go after dinner for some drinks. She also went out of her way to make sure that our experience was memorable. If you are looking for a place to take a date, this is it. If you get Lindsey as your server, then you are guaranteed to have an unforgettable experience. Highly Recommend!",

We wanted a special place to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary, and we found it!  We were first greeted by a very kind hostess and seated quickly- we had reservations, yet it seemed to be a slow night and it looked as though they were not needed.  We had a fantastic server Julian who saw to our every need and seemed to know how to come by at just the right moment without interrupting our conversation.  He patiently explained how the filet mignon was prepared- and it was delicious!  My husband had the flat iron steak that he thought was fantastic, however in all fairness the green beans were a tad bit undercooked.  There was a sweet lady that kept our glasses full!  The meal was brought to a perfect finish when Julian brought us a complimentary dessert with a cool chocolate sign that said \"Happy Anniversary!\"   As a side note: I have real issues with dizziness and I am happy to report that because the rotation is so slow I did not have any problems!  I am looking forward to coming back to this extraordinary place to celebrate more special occasions!",

I need to accept the only reason to go to a rotating resturant is for the mere fact that the place is rotating and there is a view of the skyline of whatever xyz city I am in.  I came here late night only to get a glass of wine and dessert. The wine list was actually quite decent, but the basic house wines were just-ok California large labels =(  And the dessert wasn't good. They used dried raspberries... Bleh, and during berry season. No excuse for that... even if it was the '$7 special'.  The view is great, but for wine and dessert, even in comparison to other rotating resturants, they could do much, much better.",

The Bad (and why I won't be back):  I had the eggplant and was far from impressed.   There were three breaded eggplant patties layered between mozzarella cheese, yellow tomatoes and basil. The first layer was OK but the second two left a lot to be desired. The eggplant was too thick and was very slimy. I couldn't choke it down despite a couple attempts.  I was happy I had ordered a side salad and had the bread, if not I would have left starving. Due to the very limited selection of vegetarian dishes I do not foresee coming back. I would never order the eggplant again and polenta dusted tofu doesn't sound appealing.   Maybe doing an assortment of sauteed veggies over rice, or a grilled portabella mushroom, or frankly just about anything else that doesn't involve tofu or deep frying the vegetables. Not all vegetarians eat their meals with grease and processed tofu.",

The food was highly overpriced and tasteless.  My $39.00 entree was so skimpy I was in absolute disbelief, and aside from the tiny portion of lamb, the rest of it was mediocre at best.  None of my dinner guests thought the food was worth the cost - so despite the views -none of us will return.  Our server was boring, and somewhat rude.  Our drinks took forever to get to us - and we were there at 5:30 when the place was nearly empty - and when I ordered my last drink - she never served it!  Our dinner took at least 30 minutes to get to the table.  By the end of the evening -with 6 people - 3 who were not drinking anything but water - the bill without tip was over $300.00!  I do not recommend this place unless you want to get a view and a drink and then go elsewhere to get your dinner.",

They ended up hating my \"affordably priced\" $50 bottles of wine and sent them back for something more extravagent.  Typical.  The steak was delish.  And, here's something.  I'm not much for creme brulee.  It's a'ight, but my favorite part is always the crispy sugar top.  Well, with our fixed price menu, we got a trio of brulees; vanilla, chocoloate and caramel (or dulce de leche if you're feeling fancy).  Holy crispy sugar Batman.  I ate the hell out of those things.  Maybe their crust:custard ratio was high enough for me to enjoy them, or maybe they were really good, but; they were really good. I ordered a sidecar to start however and I ended up with a snifter of Courvoisier and triple sec and a small glass with ice.  Um.  Almost. Probably not worth the price if you don't care about the view.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of visiting the Compass Room for their Christmas Buffet this past holiday season. New in town and hungry for a good meal, I was eager to briefly forget (or at least stifle) the age old family traditions currently unavailable to me, and paid $60 for a ticket to their All You Can Eat. And boy did I.  The Compass Room is located in the Hyatt Regency in downtown Phoenix. There is parking in the large parking garage across the street, or you can pull up for valet, if your occasion calls for it. Upon entering the hotel, you are greeted by a huge foyer, ornately decorated with interesting sculptures and paintings. You walk straight toward the back of the foyer to the elevators, slightly rounding a corner to the right. A desk comes into view and the attendants will ask you where you're heading. Inform them that you are going to the Compass Room, they verify your reservations, and you enter the looming elevator. You are whisked away, many, many, many floors up to the looming space ship-shaped restaurant that overlooks much of phoenix. The restaurant is as expected, nicely decorated and fancy, if you're into that scene. The window views are exceptional, providing some of the best Phoenix city views available. And the restaurant spins around 360 degrees, which, let's admit, is really frickin' cool.   Our experience was unique, in that we were there for the Christmas buffet, or do they call it the Holiday buffet now? But I am assuming that the overall experience is quite similar no matter the time. Skipping ahead to what we all want to hear about... the food. Now, I am a chef, no stranger to good food. But I'll tell ya, they got it right for buffet. After selecting a few good wines, my companion and I lurched from our seats (ok, we did it slowly... maybe too slow, to compensate for how fast we actually WANTED to move) and walked over to the first station of food. I loaded my first plate with the following items: A delicious mushroom risotto, freshly baked bread and an assortment of fancy cheeses (perhaps 7 different kinds), the ever-amazing combination of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil. The next plate got to the heart of the issue, which was a healthy portion of rosemary crusted beef tenderloin and a nice side of gravy and some excellent mashed potatoes. I took a smaller portion of ham, but admittedly was not as impressive as I had hoped. The tenderloin however, as well as the entire first plate, were simply fantastic. Fantastic enough for me to leave my seat, belt loosened, tie aside and collect a second portion of each. For dessert, they had carrot cake which was delicious, as I am a big carrot cake fan as well as a large assortment of other items. The chocolate cake was excellent as well.  The bottom line for my visit to the Compass Room, is that it was near perfect in almost every way. I will remember some of the dishes I had there for many, many years to come and I will definitely be back, if not even for the food, but the great panoramic city view.",

I had been there in July for another friends birthday and had a wonderful experience , the food was delicious and we even gotto select our own steak knives which added a touch of class to it. This time the menu had completely changed, our steak knives were on the table like a regular place setting.  The fingerling potatoes were not sauteed in anything like they were before and instead the we're dried out and then smashed like a pancake.  There was nothing classy or delicious about the new menu, except the wild mushroom flatbread which seemed to be the only thing on the menu that was the same.  4 of the 5 people were with me in July and December and were all equally disappointed.  Last time we had ordered multiple desserts, this time we were not even interested in trying any and just wanted to get out of there quickly.  The new menu and chef leave a lot to be desired.  You need to go back to the way you did things six months ago.",

This place is what is wrong with this city. The food is boring and bland, the drinks are fair and overpriced, and the atmosphere is stuffy and overrated. I would suggest trying something new.

My family and I actually had to push it together ourselves and for such an elegant restaurant I did have higher expectations.",

    "text": "Decided to go here for our 5th anniversary as I had always wanted to try this place and I decided this was a good opportunity. This restuarant touts itself as an upscale dining experience and the prices definitly reflect that. I immediatly noticed how dead it was on a Friday night at 7pm and that the decor was early 80's and a bit run down., it needs a major facelift., there was no line and the we were immediatly seated which was  good.  For our starter we were served 2 pieces of corn bread...it was good don't get me wrong but corn bread for starter at a restuarant that serves $45 dollar plates of food? We each ordered an entree and salad and a glass of wine.  When the salad came it was tiny as in literally a couple pieces of lettuce with some dressing on it. I was a bit disappointed for the price what I got  but I held on. My wife ordered the salmon and I ordered the pan seared chicken stated came with green beans, tomatoes and potatoes.  The chicken was cooked pretty good, but the Dijon mustard sauce was wayyyyy too mustardy and the chicken was tiny. The \" potatoes and green beans\" were about 4 green beans and about the same on slices of potatoes. For 30 bucks I woulda figured at least 5 of each. My wif'es salmon, a $35 dollar plate consisted of a small helping of rice pilaf and a very small filet.  She did say it was cooked well, but wasn't worth the price and the it was a bit run down and needed a facelift. My wife and are are not large people either and we ended up stopping on the way home for food after spending 150 on dinner, should have never happened. The food was ok, but not great. Go for the experience if u want, but eat first.",

    "text": "I first went here for their Thanksgiving brunch. It was delicious. They had all of your basic Thanksgiving food with a fine dining twist. On my hubby and my two year anniversary, we decided to go back since we loved it so much. They did not disappoint! We started out with the braised bacon as an appetizer. It was delicious, and the maple grits it sat on top of were the best part. Then we had the compass bisque. It is a roasted eggplant puree that has lump crab meat in it. It is a must try, even if you don't like eggplant. They had had it during the Thanksgiving brunch, sans the crab meat, but still good all the same. For my entree I had the diver scallops, and they were perfectly cooked and delicious. Then for dessert, we ordered the custard trio. It had creme brulee, a honey date flan, and some sort of chocolate custard. The waitress brought it over with a little chocolate piece that said Happy Anniversary and she even put in a candle in it an sang Happy Anniversary to the tune of Happy Birthday. The fact that you get to rotate and see the entire city while you're dining is an added bonus! I recommend it for any special occasion or whenever you don't mind spending a lot on dinner, since the place is a bit pricy (but worth it!) I would recommend it to anyone!",

    "text": "Outside of the view, this restaurant was ordinary to below average in every single way.   We arrived right at restaurant opening, and the wait staff seemed a little disorganized. But after a few minutes, we were seated with a window seat. From there on, the service was extremely slow. Our waitress, Jerry, was nice and friendly, but seemed overworked, like she had too many tables. Every course of our meal was brought out by somebody different. Wasn't a big deal, but lacked the personal touch of the same person each time.   I had the steak and wife had the chicken - both were unremarkable. They originally brought out the wrong food for my wife. I asked to see if this was actually my steak since they had my wife's order wrong, but they didn't know. So they took my steak back. Then they brought out my wife's chicken and the same steak they had taken from me. When asked how it was done to confirm it was mine, they person who brought it out had no idea.   The wine was crazily overpriced. My wife got a flight of three small pours for $17, which wasn't horrible. But when she wanted to get a glass of one of the wines on the flight, it was $20. $20! I can buy the bottle for that at the store. I realize they jack up wine prices, but that is insane. It was crazy. She ended up getting a martini instead for half the price. But even then, it took forever. We ordered drinks before we ordered dessert. We didn't get the drinks until we were almost finished with dessert, and I ate slow.   All in all, a very disappointing experience in all aspects. It was a very clearly a hotel restaurant, not a True restaurant. And there is a BIG difference between the two. When I'm spending that much, I expect decent service and good food. I got neither, and won't be returning.",

    "text": "When working downtown, this was a great \"impress out of town clients\" kind of place for lunch.  The food was always quite nice, but only because I wasn't paying.  For the price, and if impressing snooty clients wasn't involved, I would have most likely gone elsewhere.    IMHO, the best times to go are 1) Dessert and 2) Brunch.  Desert here is quite yummy, and you don't mind so much paying a bit more for a cake and coffee when you get the impeccable service, the upscale look and the ever so amazing city lights.  Brunch here is my favorite place to take folks who are visiting Phoenix.  I get teased a bit by family and friends that I'm the un-official Phoenix historical society because of how much I love pointing out Phoenix landmarks and telling everyone tidbits from their cool history.  Everyone has fun pointing out where their house is, where they went last night and were they are going on their sight seeing mission later that day.  It's also a great place to see how big Phoenix really is.  (Best spot - South Mountain) One full rotation takes about an hour, and there are plaques up around the place to tell you what building or mountain range is right in front of you.    Oh yea, the food.  It's good.  I know food shouldn't be secondary, but here it really is.  They always have a nice selection of cold seafood, pot stickers & sushi, bagels & muffins, fruit, omelets and waffles, and of course a nice selection of desserts. Of course Juice and Champagne are always included.  It's good, and you'll leave full, but the final impression will be in the view, not in the food.  And here, I think that's really as it should be.",

    "text": "This was suppose to be an awesome ending to a romantic special occasion big birthday celebration. The birthday girl requested to go here for dessert after eating at a terrific urban pizzeria which I won't name here. I read a few reviews and expected very little upon getting to the Compass. After arriving I found my ridiculously low expectations of the place to be otherworldly high.   The place was maybe 35% full yet we had to wait 10 minutes for a seat. $15 later for a scoop of ice cream with a chocolate muffin, the cook/chef had spilled some hersheys syrup on the plate and a spoonful of Neopolitan ice cream for a second desert. I will give the strawberries a thumbs up, at least I think that's what they were. I needed a magnifying glass to see what the red specks were on the strawberry ice cream.  They won't be seeing us again. The view was nice but after 45 minutes or so I saw the same buildings from our seat as when we sat down, they still had yet to go out of view. I guess if you have 2 1/2 to 3 hours to spend there you may get a view of the whole valley landscape.   In summary if you have money to throw away and want to feel as though you are someone I guess you may enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone even as an, I have to go there once type of thing. Of course if you can talk your way by the gatekeeper, instead of having to wait endless minutes for a seat only to go in and look at the view for a minute or two, you will have absorbed what little there is to absorb. Enjoy, this was about as much fun as much as having wisdom teeth pulled.",

    "text": "My husband and I have come here a few times for dinner and sometimes just for drinks and a desert. When coming for dinner, we always make reservations on open <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftable.com&s=579a88b19d338d5523f39c42fb2a3d99b458007fc991c6c96c5937caa6fb8677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">table.com</a>. We get seated within a couple of minutes. The view is absolutely amazing, we try to get there just as the sun is setting and it's beautiful everytime. The service is great, the waiters are knowledgable, friendly and very attentive. When ordering appetizers, you're paying for quality not quantity. They're delicious, but they're small portions, a great starter dish but not enough to share. If you want to start off with something, I highly suggest the compass bisque. It is packed with flavor and the most delicious bisque we've ever had. Another highlight of the Compass is the chili cornbread. I can eat that as a meal by itself, it is so good. It is also served with the honey butter and makes a perfect pair.  My husband typically order the filet mignon and he can't stop talking about how tender and delicious the meat is. He is incredibly picky about meat, but the Compass serves up a high quality peice of meat. I typically get the fish of the day, and as always it's flavorful and very fresh. I like it now how you are able to choose the sides you want. Everything from the mac n' cheese, to the garlic mash is just delicious. When there's still room, you can't leave the Compass without trying one of their desserts. We've tried the strawberry shortcake which was incredibly moist and rich, the creme brulee was to die for, and the southwest tiramisu was heavenly. They have a satisfactory wine list, it provides a variety for both the red and white drinkers.  When choosing the Compass, keep in mind both things. You're paying for the quality of food and the amazing view. This is considered by us to be a special occassion kind of place. Don't expect to walk out with a $50 bill. Everything about this place is awesome, whether you're going for dinner or simply drinks and a view. Also, if you're considering drinks and apps, try going during a monsoon, it's unbelievable!!",

Since my mother has lived here since the age of 15 I thought it would be nice to look out over her beloved Phoenix as she dined.  I was NOT happy with this visit.  Although the waitress was very nice, the service was ridiculously SLOW.  We waited and waited for our server to return to our table.  Taking our drink order, our dinner order etc. It all was very frustrating trying to figure out where she disappeared to.  The place wasn't even busy either. We wanted a dessert but we had spent SO much time there...we just skipped it.  THEN, to top it off.....they totally mess up our bill.  They had two bills for me in the bill sleeve that had a $70.00 difference.  I waited and waited to ask our server about it, but when she failed to return to our table I paid the slip that had my name printed on it...which happened to be the lesser amount.  They charged my account for the higher bill without even talking to me about it.  I certainly expect BETTER from a place like this.  I won't be back..... and plan to tell everyone how LOUSY the whole experience was.  I should have not left such a good TIP....AND....next time I'll go to Roy's...where they know how to treat customers who are paying a premium for a meal!",

( I am still dreaming about those cheesecake Taquitos and dipping sauces.SIGH) I do agree with the other reviews that the place is shockingly expensive.  You need to save up your pennies. The view is heaven! And the turning part.???? Well it revolves. YES it does. It is what the place is famous for. I never got sick from a revolving restaurant before so not sure about the bad review about that feature  but I guess seasick easily people might want to skip it here and heed the other reviewers warnings. No 5 stars though because I can't afford to eat here on a teachers budget. It probably is a once in a lifetime, or very long in between times, experience for me.",

My wife had the Kobe steak, which had great seasoning but I was unimpressed by the Kobe!  Seems like overpriced skirt steak.    Last the service and hospitality was amazing.  Another positive experience.  Totally recommend going to check this out, but watch out for the parking - it sucks!!!",

It does appear that the dress code has been relaxed. I preferred it in years past when people dressed up to go to dinner here. Our last visit ad the place loaded with people in camouflage  hoodies and john deer hats.   Food was disappointing. The Calamari was awesome but the Sea Bass and Scallops were disappointing.  Something has changed because I use to really like the sea food here. The Sea Bass was tough,dry and over cooked. You should not have to use a knife to eat fish. I ended up pulling the skin off because it was so tough.   We've decided that in the future we would just sit in the lounge area and have drinks and appetizers instead of a full meal.   I did not realize the name had been changed but it appears that they are striving for Grill  style food instead of the fine dinning it use to be. Tell the chef to keep it simple.",

    "text": "The service as far as hostess, server, food runner, was very nice and no complaints there at all. However, the restaurant itself, I was not impressed with. The windows were very dirty and had bird poop. And the food was too expensive for what it is. I went there for a special occassion and I am used to spending money for fine dining but the value of the meals at this restaurant was not good enough for their prices. Example, one appetizer with 4 shrimp pieces and some sauce was $18! I only had 1 piece as I did not like it. Second the lamb chops I got were not cooked as I wanted. I wanted medium cooked and they were rare. I have those boxed up so I will cook them more at home today. And third the cocktail I got I did not like, I am so not picky on cocktails but this one was not good. The name was raspberry raz or something. Bottom line, I've been to many fine dining places and this one I would not call one of them. The only cool thing is that it was rotating. So if the owners decided, they could use its full potential and make it a great place. I recommend to go somewhere else in the mean time.",

Our party selected pretty much half the menu which included the following:  For starters we really enjoyed the blue corn calamari.  This had just the right twist on an all time favorite.  The sweet blue corn was definitely a welcoming surprise.   Next our entrees included:  Bourbon Filet, Berkshire Pork chop, herb crusted skuna bay salmon (DELICIOUS), pan seared white sea bass and pan seared chicken all of which were very delicious selections.  The only complaint was on the filet...it was a tad dry for our taste however the cauliflower that was paired up with it was very pleasant.   Over all the service and the establishment itself was a great experience.   Great place for anniversary's, Birthdays or just a great date night out.",

My wife did the filet with green chili bread pudding and I did the flatiron entree with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steaks were cooked to perfection and dessert was even better! We split the creme brulee trio which included 3 different flavors of perfection. Traditional vanilla, Apple cinnamon, and Nutella.

Since the restaurant is upping the ante on price and food it seems like everything should be kicked up a notch.

We arrived a little before on time and were seated within just a hand full of minutes. While we were there we experienced perfect service and delicious food. We were treated very well and the wait staff was outstanding.   I have a complaint or really a suggestion, however. Since we have never been to the Compass before we maybe don't know the way holidays, Eve's, weekends, or otherwise may be set up and though we went on line for a glimpse of the menu and seating, and made reservations, there was nothing that told us anywhere that there was going to be a special limited menu for 2/13. $85 dollars a person is a little steap (especially when signature drinks are not included). If you are expecting to spend $$$$ that is one thing. We could have gotten up and left but not only would that have been beyond embarrassing, we didn't want to. We were psyched about having the experience and looked forward to it for weeks. What was funny, and a little embarrassing, was watching the couples who were seated near us after us realizing the same thing and having the same debate with eachother that we had. \"Did you know it was a special menu tonight?\" \"Are you sure you want to spend $240?\" \"Should we leave?\" Honestly, we were glad we weren't alone.   At the end of the night we had a great time and will tell the story for years.",

All of the steaks were lukewarm when we got our plates. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium. When I got it, it was tough, hard to cut through, and completely well done throughout. My friend ordered her steak medium rare and it was barely pink at all. We both sent our steaks back to have new ones properly cooked.  When we received the new steaks they both were lukewarm on the outside and cold on the inside. They must be microwaving the steaks. The macaroni and cheese that came with the sirloin steak was pretty tasty though. I'm glad I paid $39 for my plate to enjoy only the Mac and cheese and to take the steak home to my dogs. I'm sure they will enjoy it more than I did.  The dessert menu left much to be desired.  After reviewing the options, we chose to skip dessert since there was nothing appealing on the menu and we were all pretty frustrated with our meals.  As my husband said, you can get a better steak at Applebee's.",

Walking inside, you instantly get that rush of movement because of the slow rotating restaurant; I recommend if you are prone to motion sickness to either take medication prior or not go. Plus if you combine the effects of alcohol you'll be spinning in all sorts of directions.  The food is good although a bit of an odd fusion of flavors. They serve a basket of bread and fresh butter. They give one dish with two palettes of butter. One is plain and the other has a sweet taste to it. The bread is fresh. They had a cornbread mixed with green chili peppers which had an excellent flavor.  We ordered drinks. My girlfriend ordered a pineapple martini. Me being a scotch/whiskey/stout guy decides to try a signature cocktail of theirs: White Peach Sangria. Didn't realize how feminine the drink would be served. Picture a wine glass with white sangria, a slice of lemon, orange and a maraschino cherry inside completed with two straws to sip out of. I didn't hear the end of it from the girlfriend...  For entrees, my girlfriend had the Market Fish which was a Halibut over Lobster Polenta and some citrus puree. I had a Pot Roast mixed with seasonal veggies (mine had red potatoes, squash, broccoli, carrots, and onion). The Pot Roast was good, however I have to say it's a lot saucier than anticipated. The sauce they marinate it in was quite sour, definitely too much vinegar; if it were sweeter I would've been happier. I managed to find a few slivers of beef not doused in sauce and it was tender, juicy, and beautifully flavored to the point I would've wanted a pot roast without sauce.  The Halibut was a little peculiar. Maybe it was our taste buds, but it wasn't very favorable between us. The polenta, from what I could understand, was cooked with lobster so you get a hint of sweet shellfish in the crumbly polenta; I could taste the subtleness but she couldn't. The halibut was cooked but was at an odd semi-warm temperature. The dish was served with a green puree that was a little too citrusy for our taste.  Overall we had a pleasant experience. I will have to say there were a few things that caught my attention. When arriving in the hotel, we were guided to the elevators and told to take the set with glass to the 24th floor where the restaurant is. Unfortunately the call button calls a set of elevators opposite of the restaurant ones as well, so it can be a while before one of the three restaurant elevators, also used for hotel guests, makes it to you.  The other thing is service can be slow but I feel it has to do with drinks being made on ground level and the servers having to redirect themselves to their tables because the restaurant rotates. It's a wonderful experience for locals and visitors to see the State Capitol at sunset. Definitely on the pricey side and I highly recommend reserving in advance.",

Their grilled asparagus have a great flavor too. The mashed potatoes are so yummy too! The customer service could be better, the waiter didn't even say happy birthday to me even tho I had just told him it was my birthday and I wanted to try something really good. Also they didn't have a big variety of desserts, the ones that were listed didn't even sound appetizing so I didn't order any. Their drinks were pretty good tho I had an alcoholic beverage which was sweet and had the right amount of alcohol in it. Oh and don't drink too much because the restaurant rotates slowly you could barely tell it was moving at all but after awhile I got a bit dizzy. I would recommend this place to others and I would come again but of course on a special day.",

There was a problem and it took another 18 to get it solved,  So we decided that we couldn't eat there...we might die of hunger before we received our food. So we went downstairs to the sports bar.

Possibly...but there is no way that we will be back to the Compass, cool view notwithstanding.",

The rotation happens slowly, it took about an hour to get back to the place we started. We didn't get that seasickness feeling at all. A must go spot for everyone who lives here.   The food was surprisingly good, much better than it had been on my previous trips. And they had vegan and gluten-free options to satisfy everyone. .  We went to celebrate a birthday.

    "text": "While not quite, \"all show and no go,\" the sum total of my five visits to Compass Grill pretty much follow that saying.  Yesterday was the least impressive dinner of all.  Unimpressive to the point where we are planning to cancel our wedding reception dinner in November.  Yeah, the view's really cool, no doubt about it.  A good setting for those celebrating a special occasion, or entertaining people who are visiting Phoenix for the first time.   Drinks were considered good all-around, and the service was attentive and friendly.  Pacing tends towards the slower end of the spectrum, which is just what I am looking for at dinner.  Folks appreciating a brisker pace between courses will want to look elsewhere.  Generally looking at 90 minutes to two hours for a full dinner.  The Zucchini-Corn Chowder ($9) was thought to be over-seasoned and not something to consider ordering again.  Not bad, not great...just meh.  The Lobster Bisque ($11) was tasty, and had a \"lobster\" wonton in the middle, which was a unique touch. I do not believe there was any lobster meat (perhaps imitation crab meat) in the wonton.  One other note - I did not see any pieces of lobster in the bisque...at all.   Our entrees were a mixed bag.    I ordered a salad ($10), with a portion of their Bistro Steak ($20) and a portion of their scallops ($15) to add protein to the salad.  The steak came prepared medium as requested and was seasoned well.  I'd estimate the steak portion at about six ounces.  The two scallops were frozen not fresh, but tasted OK.  At $7.50 per scallop, they've got to do better than that.    My fiancee went with the Free Range Chicken Breast ($27).  She regretted her choice rather quickly.  The chicken was maybe on par with the quality you'd find at the rotisserie section of your local grocery store - heavy use of rosemary for spices, to otherwise try to compensate for the dryness.  Compounding the problem was that it was bone-in, which at this price, I find inexcusable.  Finally, the \"breast\" wasn't all breast.  There was part of a leg and/or thigh to the entree, and not much breast at all.  The accompanying risotto was hard in some areas and overcooked in others, as though it'd been prepared some time ago.  It certainly wasn't made to order for our entree.   Overall, even at $15, this would have been a real overpay.  To the credit of the server and restaurant, the chicken was taken off the bill when we expressed our disappointment.  We did not prompt Lindsey to do so, so that was appreciated.  At this point, we no longer had an appetite for dessert, so we cut the meal short.  This was really disappointing, and has left us in somewhat of a quandary.  We'd like to have the reception dinner as planned, because of the views and setting.  I realize that \"paying for the view\" isn't a concept indigenous to the Compass Grill, but feel that the food lags too far behind the setting to justify the expense.  In this environment, it doesn't have to be great food, in my opinion, but it should at least be decent across the board.    Thank you for reading!",

    "text": "I went here with my boyfriend for our 2 year anniversary. We hadn't heard many good reviews about the food but I figured it was worth a shot to try it out ourselves. The food was good, but not good enough to justify the expensive prices. However, that wasn't the problem.  We had ordered a $40 bottle of wine, which was a Robert Mondavi. We aren't very familiar with wine and didn't thoroughly review the wine list, so we weren't aware that there were multiple Mondavi wines on the list. When the waitress brought out the bottle, she explained it as the House wine, and we didn't see 'Mondavi' anywhere on the label.  When I asked if that was the Robert Mondavi, she responded, \"Oh, you want the M?\". When I asked if this was the Mondavi, she said yes so we had it brought out. The bottle said 'Mondavi' on it so when she asked if this was it, we assumed it was.  Turns out this was a $255 bottle of wine, a far cry from the $40 bottle we wanted. The waitress did NOT say that the original wine was in fact a Mondavi when I asked and instead brought out one of their most expensive bottles.  It really was just a huge miscommunication, but the manager was extremely rude and not only threatened to call the cops and have us arrested for theft, but then proceeded to talk poorly about us in the kitchen, which we could hear. We ended up getting a small discount from the check but in the end I was extremely unimpressed with our service and definitely would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Not worth the views.",

I am a foodie so when I go to a place I don't really mind the price as long as the quality of the food  justifies it. I ordered the salmon and risotto dish. Salmon was cooked to perfection, won't say it wasn't, but I was not seasoned. Risotto was gluggy and the chayote was not fully cooked. For dessert I had the queso fresco and churro cheesecake, it was ok but we all agreed the best part of it was the tiny churro ring it had on top.  My cousins were not impressed by the food either.",

The food is always better than I anticipated (I get the porterhouse, salad, garlic mashed potatoes and a 18 year scotch)   The rotating view is the best in the city (takes an hour to go all way around).  This is the perfect place for a birthday, date anniversary, or quiet evening out. (It was my birthday)   The only draw back continues to be the wait staff. They lack the manners and respect to serve a $200 meal.   Alas I am not a fancy dresser, I work hard to wear what I want and do what I want. But that does not excuse you to act like we are at mcdonalds, it is sad to see the busing/water staff to have more manners and respect then my waitress. I wish they were the ones serving me.   I will return, to enjoy the food again. But I know what to expect and you should too.",

It comes with bread and a variety of fruits to dip into either the brie or into a fruit jam.   We moved into the main course with the Flat Iron Steak. Both of us went for it and got different steak sauces to complement the DELICIOUS steak. I ordered a side of crispy brussel sprouts with bacon jam and my SO got the mashed potatoes. Y u m . com .   We finished the night with asparagus drizzled with fig balsamic and the constant influx of cornbread and sweet bread straight out of the oven. Everything was so GOOD.  Staff were very professional. Venue was spectacular. We booked for 7pm and caught the sunset perfectly. Wonderful time with my beautiful girlfriend. One area of opportunity is the price. Yes, the food is magnificent but it doesn't warrant the price. I would frequent the establishment at a much higher rate if they cut prices by 10-15%.",

We had already had dinner somewhere else and stopped there only for an appetizer, desserts, and cocktails.  We had a reservation but they did not have a table by the window in the main dining area (as I had requested), so we were offered to wait or sit by some high chairs in a separate section (next to the windows).  Well, we chose the high chairs and this turned out great, we had way more privacy and our server Karla was amazing.  The views of course are great, and the food was exquisite. My favorite was the brie fondue, delicious.  Next, we had a flight of creme brulee, and it was very unique. Hubby liked the cobbler too.  Overall a nice experience.  It is a bit pricey, but with those views you can consider it the cost of entertainment too : )  Very nice place for a special occasion, specially during sunset and night time. If you are curious, it takes about an hour for the restaurant to rotate full 360 degrees.",

The person I spoke to about reservations was curt and unhelpful at best. We were able to get a seat in the cocktail lounge and ordered a cheese board and drinks. The board was great. I had the Prickly pear margarita. It was very (too) sweet. The others' drinks were good.  The best thing was the view. It's amazing and worth going just for that.

We got there a little before sunset so we could watch the view, since the restaurant rotated above the top of the Hyatt hotel. We were able to see some amazing views of the mountains and watch the sunset! It looked just as pretty once the sun went down, seeing all the lights of the city below. It seemed like a full rotation took an hour. I saw another reviewer saying that the sun was in their eyes and they had to look at dirty rooftops below. Of course, the sun may be in your eyes at some point, and Compass can't control the conditions of the other buildings' rooftops! It was still a great view!  For dinner, we ordered the Gold Canyon filet mignon and Bistro steak medallions, with Bacon Brie Mac & Cheese and Garlic smashed potatoes, all of which were delicious! The steaks were cooked to perfection and super tender!  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse cake and a peach/pineapple cobbler! I'm a chocolate lover, but that cobbler was to die for!

I ordered the braised lamb and it was fall of the bone, but had a distinctive gamey lamb flavor. I ordered the side of roasted brussel sprouts and I was extremely dissatisfied. The end stem of the sprouts wasn't cut off giving it a tough texture. They were also burnt, passed what I would consider roasted. Nothing about this experience would make me want to come back.",

The food is good but don't order anything that is seafood it more of a steak restaurant..I did not enjoy any of the seafood..sorry just being honest I am a seafood lover and lived in places that serve fresh seafood but we are talking about AZ no Oceans...lol. However, the steak and desserts are fantastic. BTW for you Military members the hotel offers a Military discount on rooms which are very reasonable prices  since you are staying downtown. BTW lots of things to do downtown games, concerts, clubs, opera, and bars all in walking distance..reminds me of downtown Seattle..a little...",

I will admit the pesto rice was not super flavorful but I still wouldn't turn it down. They came out with gluten free bread slices for me when they noticed I was not eating the bread.   Y husband got the steak and loved it!  Of course the view is fantastic. The ambiance was very romantic with the dim lighting at night. Service was great too. I will certainly be back",

    "text": "We went to Compass for my birthday dinner last night and will not be returning again.  My fiance told me after our disappointing dinner that he had called earlier in the day to confirm our reservation and notified them that it was my birthday.  He was told that they would greet me with a \"Happy Birthday\" at the door and then they would bring out a banner and candles with dessert. He told them that would be great because he knows I love surprises...  We showed up and gave the hostess the name on the reservation, but there was no birthday greeting.  That was fine with me because I wasn't expecting it.  Then, when we got to the table the hostess asked if we were celebrating anything, and we told her it was my birthday.  The waiter came by a moment later and also asked if we were celebrating anything, and once again we told him it was my birthday. Despite having asked about it, neither really acknowledged it.  It was like they were just reading from their script, but not listening to the answers.   The service was awkward from the very beginning - the waiter stood there waiting for our drink orders while we clearly were not ready (we were both trying to look at one wine list and passing it back and forth across the table), and then finally asked if we needed another moment.  We ended up ordering cocktails, and my pomegranate margarita was not good - it tasted heavily of sour mix.  I drank less than a third of it and decided it wasn't worth the calories.   I ordered the scallops for dinner and my fiance ordered the salmon.  Both were decent but unremarkable. The service remained awkward throughout dinner.  We were pretty full when it came time for dessert, so we decided to split the goat cheese cheesecake.  Once again, decent but unremarkable.  The disappointing part was that they didn't even put a candle in the dessert or decorate the plate or anything - so much for birthday pictures. And I didn't know to expect the banner, but my fiance was disappointed that they had told him about it but didn't follow through - he was really looking forward to surprising me.   This brings me to the worst part.  We spent over $100 on dinner - we had ordered salads, entrees, dessert, and drinks - and not only did they not really acknowledge that we were celebrating my birthday, they didn't even comp my dessert! This is the first restaurant I've ever been to that didn't do SOMETHING to acknowledge a birthday - whether it be a candle, special plate decoration, or at least free dessert.     Bottom line - the view was pretty, the food was mediocre, and the service was terrible.  So disappointing!",

I expected the fifth visit to be just the same, however, that did not play out in my favor. The atmosphere was just as great as it was in the times prior and the food was not bad at all. The problem, which ruined our night, was our waitress. Note, I have always experienced professional service when I come here, (exactly what should be expected at a high end restaurant). She was absolutely rude, unprofessional, and unaccommodating to any of our requests. I asked for a side of mashed potatoes and when they arrived at our table they were cold and dry. I politely apologized for the inconvenience and asked for them to be taken away. She responded by saying, \"So, you just want me to take them back?\" I looked at her with complete confusion. She checked on our table ONCE throughout the whole dinner which was a few hours. When we received our check, the mashed potatoes were still on the check and I let her be aware of that and she got super frustrated and didn't even apologize, her response was, \"OMG, I forgot\". THAT WAS IT. That was the end of our night, she never came back to apologize nor wish us a great rest of our evening, nor said thank you. Absolutely nothing. She came back and put the fixed check on our table and stormed off. I will definitely not be returning to the Compass Grill for a while after this disappointing service.",

Although the Phoenix skyline isn't all that exciting, the restaurant still offers a nice view of the city.  If you are a tea drinker, the Compass offers Numi tea (my favourite) as well as Tazo. The peach upside down cake was generously portioned, but every component (cake/ice cream/tres leches sauce) on the plate was too sweet skyrocketing my blood sugar. I would have liked more peach slices on the cake...  Our server made a mistake of overcharging me (looking at the receipt, I noticed just right now...), but he was friendly and courteous. Next time, I'll double-check the bill before I sign and I should order a bread pudding or cheesecake!",

For the main course, I had a pork chop which was a bit dry but otherwise nicely done. I wouldn't refuse it if asked again. To top off the evening, I a Peach Upside Down Cake which was considerably larger than I expected and quite tasty.  SETTING  24th floor rotating restaurant in an area with barely any high rises... so yes, awesome. You get to see the valley in a way you can't see it anywhere else.  The sitting is nicely done in several separate compartments making it feel cozier. The rotational mechanism is a bit on the loud side, but not offensive.  SERVICE  Pleasant, quick and unobtrusive.  OTHER  Parking for a car higher than 6'5\" can be an issue in the parking structure near by, so if you have a tall truck, you'll have to find something on the street.",

I almost asked for the tip to go solely to her. Speaking of the tip, I wrote \"cash\" on the tip portion of my credit card receipt and left her a $20 on a $90 check. When I got home afterwards on that Saturday night, I noticed my card was charged an extra 20%. I thought maybe it was their procedure that the charge would drop off (even though there was only 2 of us). It's now Monday and the 20% never dropped off and the charge has completely posted. I've called twice with no returned call as of yet. There's no way she's getting a $40 tip on a $90 bill when my original tip of $20 was waaayyy generous for the service/subpar food.

Monday morning I cannot get up from bed anymore.  I had called the nurse line of my insurance company and told them what happened, they told me to try to drink pedialite and keep eating soft foods.  The bad thing pedialite has a very high sodium and after drinking 1 bottle it gives me high blood pressure.  After what happened to me I will never eat to this restaurant again.",

Watching the fireworks going off all over the city with a glass of wine and a good meal is a pretty wonderful experience. July 4th aside though, the Compass is a bit overpriced, the food is always good, but not quite as amazing as the price would make you think. You're really paying for an incredible (seriously incredible) view and a very romantic atmosphere. The menu changes frequently, so it's hard to make recommendations, but if the lobster bisque is available, get it. With consistently good service, three star food, an incredible wine list and a view that can't be beat, four stars seems totally fair to me. I can't think of a more romantic restaurant in the Valley, and even though it's a little overpriced it's still a place we love to go to make memories.",

Our reservation was for 6:30pm I wanted to make sure we would be there in time for the sunset which did not disappoint! The view is great and even better when it is dark out and you can see the twinkling lights from the cars below.   Our waitress, Jerry, was very sweet! Extremely helpful, talkative and great service overall. We had help from another gentleman who would occasionally pass by and fill our water glass. Let me tell you our water glass was never empty it was his mission to fill them!   The food was good. It took around 30-45 minutes to get our food after we ordered it. It was a busy night but there were tables open. Luckily we ordered an appetizer that kept us going until our food arrived.  Our food was good. I ordered the Steak Medallion which came out very rare and I had asked for medium/well but there was no way I was going to wait another 30 minutes for my food if I sent it back so I ate it without complaint. My fiance ordered the chicken sandwich and blue cheese mac & cheese. We aren't a fan of blue cheese but it wasn't actually bad.  We spent 2 hours there and the only reason we know that is because we went in two full circles (at 55 minutes a complete 360 degrees)   *************PARKING *********************** Downtown Phoenix can be tricky with its \"one way\" only, narrow streets. It can cause some anxiety if you are not used to it. We didn't really know what we were doing with parking so we parked in the Chase Tower parking garage which is north of the Hyatt. 2 hours came out to $12. However, if you park in the Regency Parking garage which is just south of the Hyatt the restaurant can validate 2 hours of parking where as they cannot do that for the Chase Tower Parking Garage.",

It is fine dinning so obviously prices are going to be a little high plus your paying to a beautiful view so idk why people complained about it being too expensive. Love love this place food was delicious!! Amazing staff",

    "text": "Our dinner reservation was for 6pm. We showed up at 5:30pm to see if we could be seated early. The hostess stated \"We will seat you at 6pm\". I asked if we could order an alcoholic beverage from the bar, she stated No, If you want a drink you need go back to the first floor & order something from the restaurant. So back down we went. We bought 2 drinks (Bloody Mary & vodkas tonic) our price was $23. We had to wait in line to get back on the elevator. We arrived promptly at 6pm. I again checked in with the hostess station. We were not seated until 6:18pm. There was zero explanation as to why we were seated so late and there were many other couples waiting to be seated for 6pm. The hostesses write your name on a small sticky note and they line them up and seat you by that. Finally, we were seated with many open tables and they were not busy.  Couldn't figure out what the delay was? We had 7:30pm ballet tickets at the Convention center and I knew we'd be late. The view from the restaurant was impeccable & the waitress provided top notch service. We mentioned to her we would be late due to being seated late, I couldn't finish my entree (due to time) so we had to pay and leave quickly to make it before curtain. The food was excellent but we felt rushed. Wished we could have stayed longer. When we left, there were around 10 couples waiting to be seated. The manager gave us a huge credit to our bill. We were very grateful. The hostesses need to figure out the seating situation - once you get seated the other staff takes over and provides excellent service!!! I would go back - but not on a night in which I had another event to attend.",

First we sit down and the girl is all angry and obviously didn't seem to want to serve us so then she disappears for like 15 min, we have no water or anything so then finally a guy comes along and says she went home but she didn't we saw her the whole night. So obviously In frustrated at this point. No one said happy birthday, there was no dessert, the waiter kept squint stay hydrated and was just arrogant. It was pretty unfortunate because I usually come here frequently and I was with people who just came here so I was trying to show them a good and nice time.",

    "text": "The food was awesome.  The ambiance was great. The setting was romantic.  The service left much to be desired.   I made a reservation 24 hours prior to arriving with my date.  At time of reservation I let the restaurant know it was Heather's birthday and I asked if they could set the table with flowers.  At the time I was told it was no problem.  On the way to dinner, traffic was heavy so I called to inform the restaurant we'd be a few minutes behind.  I was told it was no problem and our table would still be there for us.  It was at that time I was told that they wouldn't be able to do flowers as they need to be purchased ahead of time.  (This could have been communicated to me when making the reservation).     We arrived 5 minutes after our reserved time and checked in.  We then waited 10 minutes or so before being seated (assuming our table had been given to others or not prepared yet).  Once seated we were in a section with several empty tables which left us confused as to why we waited in the lobby for these tables?   (I'd rather wait at an empty table with a view than the small lobby by the elevators, especially near sunset).     Upon checking in the hostess asked if there was a special occasion.   I told her it was Heather's birthday... which was actually written on the reservation card that I could see on the desk.  Someone else seated us and asked if it was a special occasion, I told her it was Heather's birthday.    Our first server came up to fill our waters and asked if it was a special occasion, and I told them it was Heather's birthday.  And finally our server arrived and asked if it was a special occasion... I again, for the fourth time told him it was Heather's birthday.   I don't recall any of those four to acknowledge it and wish Heather a Happy Birthday.  Our server came by twice before I asked him if we could order our drinks.   It felt like it took 10 minutes for the drinks to arrive and as the waiter was leaving I asked if we could order.  All employees were pleasant enough, but none seemed to know what was going on.  It felt as if all were on their first week on the job and first time in the service industry.  Food was great, atmosphere was awesome, views were amazing.  Service could  use some coaching and development.",

The reason for only issuing 2 starts: our wait staff belonged in a much less expensive eatery, took drink order, came back 15 min later and took appetizers order, still no drinks. Drinks and appetizers came out but we still had not ordered dinner and had to eat our appetizers with the large bulky menu in our laps. Lobster bisque was good. Salads were very small. I ordered the Brie fondue and it was good except the pomegranates were bad, FERMENTED. Dinner was ok nothing great!  Not worth the $500 tab!",

We arrived early & enjoyed a nice drink down in the lobby bar before taking the fast elevator up to the Restaurant.  We were still early, but they were able to get us right in and immediately the ambiance of the Restaurant and the view of the city were amazing.  They gave my wife a long stem rose and wished us both Happy Valentine's day which we both thought was very cool.  Our Waitress and her assistant were both very good and our drinks stayed full the entire meal.  The Food was amazing.  It's not food we have each day, so it was certainly a treat for us.  They even had 2 little surprises during the meal from the chef that was over and beyond what was expected.  Even though it was a holiday, our meal was never rushed.  Having the Restaurant revolve and being able to see the entire city during sunset made the meal & the experience even better.  Overall the food, ambiance, experience and service was outstanding and we will certainly be going back again soon.",

The Compass Grill is located in the Hyatt hotel. We got to the hotel and saw so many high school students. It was their Prom night. Brought back so many old memories. There is a elevator that takes you to the 24th Floor where the restaurant is located. We got there and was greeted by the hostess who saw that my boyfriend requested a seat by a window. She told us it would be about a 10- 15 minute wait since those tables are first come first serve. About ten minutes later she walks us to a beautiful table right next to the window. We went at a perfect time because we got to see the sunset. A older woman came by and filled up our water glasses, she was so pleasant and friendly. Our waiter  was precise and wonderful. We both had the mole chicken with mashed potatoes and mole sauce on the side. We also shared the crab cakes which was definitely our favorite! As for drinks I had a American Mule and my boyfriend had a mojito. The icing on the cake was they gave me a complimentary birthday dessert which was delicious!   The restaurant itself revolves and it takes an hour to do a full circle. It is definitely a fun experience to check out on special occasions or if you're from out of town. We do wish there were more food options, but overall it was a great dinner.",

    "text": "This restaurant is nearly impossible to get to if you're staying in the hotel. First off, it's only accessible through the glass elevators. It was hard enough getting into those because only the other elevators were coming to our floor every time we pushed the up button. After 15 mins of waiting for the right elevator, we got to the 24th floor only to find a waiting room area full of people and a long line. It was completely disorganized. The hostess wasn't doing her job by taking names. Everyone just stood in the line. Some lady came out of the elevator, went to the front of the line, gave the hostess her name, and was put way ahead of all of us waiting. Finally my husband went up after 20 mins of standing in line and asked why it's taking so long to just put our name in. She finally got a clue and took everyone's names.  When we were finally seated the hostess asked if we'd like anything to drink. We asked for 2 coffees with cream and sugar. We were brought the coffee and sugar but no cream. The waiter came and we asked him for the cream, which never came. 10 mins later my husband got up and went toward the kitchen to find the waiter and ask him again for cream. We finally got it but by this time my coffee was lukewarm at best. Now for the order. I ordered the chilaquiles with no pico de gallo. When I got it, it had the pico all over it. I sent it back, was given a new one but now with no red sauce and the pico on the side. I was so annoyed at this point that I took a bite and it was terrible. We ended up asking for the bill and left. The waiter and manager were apologetic and comped the meals we didn't eat but this experience was horrible. The view isn't worth the trouble.",

Server was friendly, but fairly inattentive.  I get that a lot of places when I go in \"off hours\".   I got an omelet and a Bloody Mary.  Both were fair.  This was more of a 3-star experience, but I'm giving it 4 because of the ambience/view, and the server being friendly.  I would give it one more chance, but would probably go for dinner.  I do highly recommend they consider adding a bar, as many people staying in the hotel at any given time are traveling alone, and many (like me) hate sitting at a table alone.",

I guess that's her excuse for bing rude .",

I was almost full from the app. And it was dare I say the best calamari in the valley.   Now the MAIN dish I got the steak the big boy. It was worth every penny I get rare because anything more you dry out and ruin the meat. But they made it to perfection and you know that when no sauce is needed the meat.   Since went there for a special occasion they took care of my dessert and that was so delicious I almost ordered another one but I was way too full.

They start you off with a really delicious corn bread and butter. We kept asking for more! Their lobster bisque soup was good too but I could not finish the entire bowl. Their scallops were recommended but were not that tasty. The salmon was probably my favorite dish that evening. The lighting is a bit dim inside so you can barely see your food. Haha.

If you are a fan of Prime Rib, you have GOT to try the Compass Room's version.  It is cooked in a Merlot which makes it taste uber-fancy and your significant other will want to strip you down right there and thank you properly. For desert, try the Tiramasu.  It has thick chocolate walls printed with the signature 'Compass Room' and will put everyone in the mood for a party!  The price is pretty high.  Like Amy said, about $80 per head. But definitely worth it.  For this, I believe the Compass Room's logo should be \"Sit, Spin, Go Home and Get Some\"  Do it. Do it.",

    "text": "It makes me sad to give the Compass only 3 stars, but frankly, it's really the best I can do after this recent visit.   Don't get me wrong, the view, amazing. The service was very professional and well done. I just am very disappointed in the menu changes the Compass has made since my visit there last year with respect to the menu.   The menu is all about the grill. I guess this is fine, but it doesn't really go with the air of elegance that the Compass tries to convey. The Compass used to be about fine dining which went along with the sophistication of the room. This current menu is limited and doesn't really showcase the talents of the chef. One of the problems with the Compass is that it's so freaking dark in there, you don't really get to actually see the food. I understand why they keep it dark; so you can enjoy the lights of the city...but dammit, I do want to at least see what I'm eating. Fine dining is about all 5 senses....and some chefs really miss the mark on this. The Compass is no exception, unfortunately.   We started out with the warm brie appetizer which was a medium size hunk of brie wrapped in a crispy crust placed on top of an arugula salad. Basically, it was an overinflated cheese stick. There was more crust than brie although the arugula had a nice viniagrette on it. The tastes were fine, but I just didn't feel like they went together very well.   We shared an iceberg wedge salad. You can't really miss with a wedge and this one was good. The Maytag Bleu Cheese dressing was lovely and they added some olives and grape size tomatoes. I just wish that restaurants would make bacon a standard issue item on the iceberg wedge. It's just better with bacon.   Prior to our meals coming out, the server came to us with a display of 4 different steak knives that we could choose from to use to cut our meat. I am still kind of baffled by this and why this should be necessary for us to select our weapon of choice for the meal, but we selected a sturdy wooden handled sabre and it was adequate for our needs...I hope. LOL.   My son had the NY Steak with a huckleberry sauce. The sauce was a nice addition to the steak which on it's own was unseasoned and blah. Fine for a 9 year old, but for $33 bucks, I expect a little more. The Yukon mashed potatoes were delicious; creamy and very flavorful.   I had the prime rib with a side of chipotle macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was just ok. The creamy horseradish sauce that was on the side for the prime rib was good--not too horsey like some places tend to do, but just enough to add some bite to the meal. But the prime rib itself lacked flavor and charm. Disappointing considering the price and the location.  The company was great, the service was very well done, and the atmosphere was nice, but I'm afraid that this time, it was the food that was subpar and that's a shame. It's likely that the next time we are downtown for an evening at the ballet, we'll be picking another restaurant to visit.   I am also sad to say the Compass no longer serves Sunday Brunch. I used to enjoy their brunch a great deal but with the change of chef, comes a change of direction for the restaurant. Hopefully they will bring back the brunch because it was a very nice place to take out-of-towners as well as just to relax on Sunday.",

Its menu has a fairly sophisticated selection and for the price it's a pretty good deal for a swanky hotel bar place in down town PHX. They have a fairly decent brunch on Sunday morning with generous helping of the mimosas (and they aint shy about pouring) Not an everyday place for sure but a place to take the folks while they visit from out of town and have them wow'ed at the pretty lights as they stand elevated looking at the valley, or to take that special date where you want a memorable quiet night to get to know each other. The service is what you would expect from a place of this caliber and the wine selection is not out of this world...but hey you must remember you are really on top of the Hyatt :P  All and all worth while experience.",

I had salmon and opted for polenta with my meal instead of mashed potatoes and I'm glad to see that both grits and polenta were mainstays on their list of sides.  The only miss for me was the chili cornbread which I didn't find to be that great, although my comrades seemed to like it.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary dinner and the experience was terrible. We had reservations at 6:30 and it took us 10 minutes of standing around before someone brought us to our seats.  We sat down and was asked what we would like to drink. We answered and then looked at the menu for literally 30 seconds and the server comes and ask us if we're ready to order. We say no, but can you come back in a bit. He then comes back 20 MINUTES later and rudely ask \"what are you going to order\"  Not only was it that, but i ordered the pork loin and oh my wow. I have never in my life asked for another dish before. I did for this. It was so terrible. I know what Fine Dinning is, and trust me, this isnt. My boyfriend couldnt eat it either and then we both had beef medallion, which was ONLY acceptable, not worth 37 dollars.  Terrible food terrible service. I appreciated what my boyfriend tried to do, but if you're trying to take someone to a special dinner, this place isnt it. it IS NOT worth that much money to go to this place.  All in all, terrible service terriple food",

Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.    We had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city, which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway, I am sure the menu has changed, but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view.",

If that seems too indulgent, invite someone from somewhere else as your excuse to visit one of Phoenix's premiere dining landmarks.  The Compass Room makes one full circle high over the city atop the Hyatt Regency downtown. The dcor is black-and-white minimalist with floor-to-ceiling windows. Of course, window seating is preferred and in demand. The food can be very-good or average-good, and the menu changes frequently.   But frankly, you don't really come here for the food. It's the VIEW. And living in a boom town like Phoenix, there's always something new to see. From 1995-98, we watched the BOB going up. In 2004-05, the entire block below was buzzing with little ant-sized workmen and a giant crane for major expansion and refurbishment. What will the view be in 2007?",

    "text": "I'm modifying my original 2-star review because I just went back to the Compass and had what my wife and I consider to be the meal of our lifetime. I'm not kidding . . . it was as good as good gets. It makes me think that my original experience, where we were very disappointed by a 45 minute wait past our reservation hour, must have been a fluke. As long as you remember to use the Regency Garage and not the hotel valet, you'll have a great night. They will validate you for two hours at the Garage, but at the valet in front they will only give you a $2 discount.  My wife and I both ordered the \"Filet Oscar,\" which was the best piece of meat we've ever had in any restaurant. It was cooked to perfection, with a generous helping of crab meat on top of the steak. The large, generous portion of asparagus the steak was served atop (nearly 1/2 inch thick stalks) was steamed just right.   The side dishes are a value at $5 and were healthy portions. My wife loved the corn bread, which is a special recipe, and the waitress (a very special gal named Patty) came back to us with a copy of the recipe.  The wine selection by the glass is excellent and Patty recommended a wonderful Argentinian malbec that was just great with the steak. Wines by the glass here are available in two sizes -- they are expensive, but it looks like they are upgraded bottles than most restaurants serve by the glass.  The food is pricey here also but you'd expect to be paying for the view. Speaking of the view, WOW. There's Phoenix laid out in front of you for your inspection, making for wonderful dinner table conversation. it would be a great place for couples and special evenings, or because of the view, a great place to bring a business acquaintance where you want to impress them with some wonderful views of the Valley of the Sun.  The ride up the elevator is great, too. As I said in the beginning, however, don't use the valet unless you want to fork over some serious change to park. The Compass needs to work out a deal with valet parking in my opinion -- that's the only hitch. I hope your night is as special as ours was.",

    "text": "Hmph... I had always wanted to try this spot, and living within walking distance for the past 3 years hasn't done much to change that, until now.  After catching a show at the Herberger, Ashley A. suggested we go here for drinks/food.  I wasn't really feeling it because I was scared of what I expected in terms of premium pricing, but we went anyway.  The elevator ride up was fun and it made my ears pop.  Once we got off the elevator though, things kind of stopped being fun and I felt like I just stepped into a closet.  It was so dark!  I will give the Compass one thing, their service is fantastic.  Unfortunately, service does not make up for the lack of quality in food or the overwhelmingly inflated prices.  They didn't have Coke, which really irritated me, so I just had a water.  We ended up getting the Drunken Shrimp app since we weren't entirely hungry and then the Lava Cake for dessert.  The sauce with the shrimp was startlingly salty.  Even for me, and I oversalt everything.  The shrimp were okay, and there were only three.  Seriously?  20 bucks for 3 shrimp and a piece of bread.  Sheesh!  At least the desserts were priced fairly.  The lava cake was okay, but it doesn't even come close to my beloved Domino's Lava Crunch Cake.    After checking out the rather uninspired menu and it's awe inspiring prices, I won't be back.  Besides, the view from the top of the Chase Tower is much more impressive, so the view alone will not get me to come back.",

The ingredients in the salad weren't fully explained and when it came out I realized I hate multiple items on it.. I tried to find the server, but she never came back. My date had to awkwardly half eat, half wait for me. By the time she came back - she just wanted to clear the plates. She did bring out a different salad - but I was charged for both.  Our entrees were mediocre at best. Steaks that were over-cooked and under marinated.   We were given a birthday dessert that was nicely decorated, but then we were charged for that as well. This isn't actually a big deal, but I've never had to pay for celebration dessert at any restaurant before. The Olive Garden gives you a free cake for crying out loud.  That being said, the place has a cool concept. The spinning room in downtown is really cool. If you really must check it out - just grab a drink. The food is expensive, terrible, and will be served to you in an un-timely and unfriendly manner.",

My daughter and I went there while staying at the Hyatt and being vegetarians, are options were extremely limited...and by that I mean we literally ate lettuce! Yes the grilled romaine was tasty, but hardly a meal. My daughter had a side of the risotto and  quite liked that. I would love to see places like this offer some great vegetarian options on par with their meat menu. It really is disappointing.   Bottom line; if you are staying at the Hyatt, order room service, which is great, and then go up to the Compass for drinks and the experience.",

Caesar salad dressing was bottled and did not like the cheese choice,  but the crouton was delicious. The filet mignon was well cooked, but flavorless, mashed potatoes were subpar, the asparagus was wrinkly, but the pepper sauce was delicious. Scallops were fishy tasting and had no crunch from the sear. The corn succotash was good as well as the cauliflower puree. There was only a small section of beautiful views due to big buildings blocking. Also looking at the roofs of the nearby small buildings was not pretty either. I would not recommend this place at all.",

    "text": "Days latter and I am still feeling frustrated about our experience.  I was part of a large group celebrating my friends bridal party.  The maid of honor worked so hard on planning and putting together an amazing night, and I hated seeing her taken advantage of, this place is terrible.  They originally told her $35 per person, app entree and dessert, then they told her $45, then they removed dessert.  Poor girl had to keep updating us that we were paying more and getting less, lots of pressure on her.  Then we get there, the service was inattentive, and unenthusiastic.  The meal consisted of less than one cup of greens, a small wedge of cheese, a bad dressing and two grape tomatoes as the salad and only option for an appetizer.  The pork option I chose was the worst pork chop I have ever had, as tough as possible and bland.  The mashed potatoes were dry, but flavored well, the only thing on the plate that was, the vegetable was three sprigs of asparagus and the sauce was way too sweet.  The portion was tiny.  The gratuity was added, as it should be for such a large party, making the bill $58 for a tiny amount of crappy food.  I love fine dining, I understand small portions are the usual, but they are made to perfection and satisfy through quality.  Not here.  The thing that has nothing to do with me, but still makes me so angry is our reservation was set for a certain number of girls, and some were unable to make it and didn't tell the maid of honor until hours before our reservation, the restaurant still charged her for two of the three plates for people who were not even there.  They sent it with her in a doggy bag, so she got food for the charge, but 14 girls were there, 14 $58 paying people, they profited HUGELY from our group, those two bills did not need to be charged.",

    "text": "I made my reservation for 6 pm and was running a little late due to rush hour traffic while picking up my friend I was treating to dinner. I called to let the hostess we were running a little late. We arrived and I valeted my car. Be aware that self parking is validated and valet parking receives a $2 off validation. I deal with parking all the time living and working downtown so I just splurged and went the valet way.   Upon arriving up on the 24th floor we were greeted by a friendly hostess along with a new employee being trained. We were promptly seated. Our server's name was Patty. She has worked at Compass for 29 years she said, and it showed in a very positive way. She was very sweet, and knew exactly how to do her job. I love a server who can converse and be down to earth while maintaining a certain level of professionalism. She was awesome.   We ordered their very popular Eggplant Bisque Soup. The portion seemed a little small at first but even Patty mentioned that the soup is fairly rich. She was right! The portion was just right for this soup which was delicious but would of been way to filling if the size had been any larger.   They gave us little cornbread muffins with a couple of different flavored butters with a side of sea salt. These were yummy, but nothing mind blowing. It brought back memories of the cornbread my parents made when I was a kid.   I ordered the scallops which came with a corn risotto. The scallops were huge and very flavorful. The risotto was very good but I have to admit I wasn't a huge fan of the way it looked. That's me being picky though, it was still very good.   For desert we decided to have the fried zucchini bread and it was really good.   The prices are pretty hefty, the food was good, but really my server Patty and the amazing view of Phoenix while the sun went down is what pulled me in with this place. I would be sure to recommend people to sit with Patty as she really was a pleasure having as our server. I must say too that the girl that refreshed our drinks and water was very sweet too. She talked with us about the Suns game going on the evening we dined, as I saw traffic picking up downtown which doesn't usually happen on a Wednesday evening.   Overall I say the food is a tad bit overpriced for the portions that are received, the decor could be changed up a little but it's a rotating restaurant after all. I enjoyed my meal, my friend enjoyed his meal, and I left happy. This would be a great place to take someone who hasn't seen Phoenix before as it makes you feel like you're in a big city and shows how far Phoenix goes with the views. Oh and ask for Patty, she's awesome! It probably would of been a three star review, but service goes a long way with me. I can handle just good food if I have amazing service.",

    "text": "There is just not a better place in Phoenix to take out of town guests to see the view.    My Mom and I brought our friends there who were visiting from New York....   The view(s) are breathtaking... especially if you make reservations just before sunset... you get to see the daytime and nighttime views.   It's a quiet elegant atmosphere and makes for a truly memorable evening...  But.... Then there's the food.    We ordered their appetizer special which was shredded veal in a pastry and sounded amazing, but the pastry was hard and crumbly.  The veal was flavorful, but the pastry was so hard that it seemed to soak up the moisture from the meat.    Their menu selection is a bit limited, there's not a lot to choose from.   I had the Pan Seared Scallops with the corn succotash.   My scallops did not have a nice carmelized sear on them which I was really hoping for, in fact, they were a bit under cooked in my opinion.  The corn succotash was pretty good.   I had a taste of my friend's jalapeno cheddar risotto cakes- and I was really quite embarrased that I brought them here and they had to eat that!   It was bland and sticky... not even a slight tinge of flavor.   They said they enjoyed their steaks, but I can't imagine anyone being thrilled with that side item.    I tried my Mom's Brown Sugar Cured Pork Chop and it was 'fine'.    This restaurant really has a market cornered on view and ambiance, but I don't think they take very good advantage of it.     I don't ever remember coming here when it was packed.  Why not?  It's the sign of a great restaurant, but this one is not that great because of the food.   I wish they'd step up their game and serve better food.  It would be a place I would go to on a regular basis instead of just when I had visitors.",

We were seated a few minutes after six. We ordered from the theater menu to save some time as the staff recommended. Needless to say, our cocktails were watered down too much, the appetizers were well under portioned and the Salmon took over one hour to prepare and it was thrown over some cauliflower; not exactly a wonderful presentation !  We originally ordered from the pre fixe menu which included a desert but since time became a significant factor, we cancelled it.  My wife and I had to eat quickly, pay as we were eating and get over to Symphony Hall ; we were able to get to the venue at 7:20 because thankfully it was across the street.  Needless to say, the show made the night, not the restaurant.",

    "text": "Went to Compass last night to celebrate my birthday. All my friends were excited since none of us had been there. We went after school, 9 p.m.  As soon as we arrived the staff seemed to be annoyed by the size of our group, customer service very low at this point... should have turned around and gone somewhere else.   But we pushed on, they sit us 10 minutes later and our waiter Julian, comes to \"greet\" us. First thing that comes out of his mouth is something like... just to let you know is going to take 30-45 minutes to get your checks. I asked him why he was talking about the check if we've just arrived. He said, just letting you know in case anyone has to leave, and to make things simpler. Not sure what that really meant... we asked about the reverse happy hour and he quickly mumbled through the list. It was loud and was hard to hear. We asked him to repeat them again because we only caught about half of it. He seemed frustrated, we are all from different countries, Colombia, Bosnia, Serbia, Argentina, Bangkok and of course from all parts of the U.S... so it's not about the accent, is about good customer service.   He carded everyone, which is good, but one of my friends couldnt find her id. Understandably he couldn't serve her any alcohol. We are all adults, we understood. But he went on to give us a speech about it, like we were children needing some parenting time. We are all between 25-35... really? no need for that. Our behavior was appropiate, we were curtious and understood that he could not serve her alcohol. He came later to re-card my friends from Bangkok because he forgot which didn't have her id. Really? Is it because they are both asian, apparently Julian couldn't tell the difference between one asian and another asian... just plain rude.  I tried to get to change his mood by speaking to him in Spanish... he was short and dry. At this point I am willing to ignore him and move on.   The Specialty Drink sucked. No way to say it better... watered down and lacking taste... isn't it supposed to be special? Hence the name. About 10 minutes later he shows up asks us how we want the checks split. I said, why are we doing that, are we leaving already? He said, \"just making things easier\" and left. Five minutes later he arrived with our checks... I guess we are leaving! He didn't even asks us if we wanted another drink. Just because we inquired about happy hour doesn't mean that we are cheap or that we will only have one drink...We are all working professionals working on a graduate degree, and even if we were just students, even if we were on a thight budget, wouldn't you still want our business?   The view was great, and the ambiance was OK. Louder than I expected it.  Customer service: horrendous, below, below horrendous if that is even possible. I work downtown and because of my position I come accross many people in an every day basis. Compass will never be a place I recommend to anyone. I wish there was an option to leave 0 stars.",

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying that this is an upscale restaurant, located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, inside a major hotel and . . .  are you ready for it??? . . .  it spins so that as you dine you get to enjoy a 360*, panoramic, constant changing view of Phoenix.  That alone should scream PRICEY!!   For anyone who has ever dined at a formal, upscale dining establishment such as this, you know that the price is high while the portions are small.  However, the food is worth it.  This is True of The Compass Arizona Grill.   My husband had the filet, while I enjoyed the seared scallops.  The filet was done med. rare, flavorful and melted in your mouth.  The scallops were tender and succulent with just the right amount of butter.  At the end of our meal we decided to share a dessert (the Chocolate Pot . . .) which was just the right amount of sweetness and rich decadence we were looking for.   Over all the ambiance and the food made this one of the nicest dining experiences.  If you can afford it and understand that pricey doesn't always mean a large portion but does mean excellent food, then I highly recommend The Compass Arizona Grill.",

I liked that it has little signs on the wall with facts on them that you can read as you spin around.  It doesn't spin real fast but I get sick easily.  I did feel a little nauseous at times.  It takes an hour to do one full rotation.  My husband and I came here for our 1 year anniversary.  It was a Monday night and the place was packed and very loud.  The design of the restaurant enhances noise and makes it even louder.  My husband and I could barely hear each other and our waitress had trouble hearing us too.  She was very friendly though.  The restaurant had done one complete rotation (1hr) before our food came out.  I had the chicken cooked two ways.  It was ok, but it was not worth the $30.  Every entree is $30+. Drink prices are outrages.  My husband had a simple drink (don't remember the name) and it was $13. The Compass will validate your parking but it was unclear where we were supposed to park and we ended up parking in the wrong place and had to pay $7.",

    "text": "If first impressions could kill...   Glenn and Bri D. accompanied a friend and I to Compass Restaurant. After stepping off the fun (and I mean fun!) elevator ride up to the restaurant I instantly felt dizzy - everyone got a laugh when I instinctively asked 'why do I feel weird' - Um, the room is moving. The unease got better when we moved from the core (non-moving) of the building to the seating (the actual rotating floor).   The service was SO good. Our waitress was super nice and attentive to a level I'm not really used too, but I could get used to it! We ordered the prime rib and she came back so apologetic that she even let us order it, that she gave us two filet mignon dishes - which were really good. I got the mac n' cheese as my side dish, which had a sweetness to it - a unique taste, but not appealing to me.   The dessert was disappointing. Strawberry shortcake seems like an easy-to-please/hard-to-mess-up kind of dish...I guess I was wrong. The shortcake was dry and had no flavor, the tiny shot of whip cream was the best thing about it, but it was only the size of a silver dollar...sad day.   I have definitely experienced better food for less. The service was outstanding, but didn't make up for the lackluster in the food and ambiance.  By the way, I got even sicker on the way out and that stuck with me all night, making it hard to go to sleep :( No bueno...",

    "text": "I haven't written a review before, so I'm not sure how to organize this. Let's go with the traditional:  Pros: - The view. You will probably do just more than a full rotation during one dinner. - The servers were kind and attentive.  Cons: - Overpriced. - Food was brought out very slowly. - If you don't want steak, there isn't much variety on the menu. - The food was poor (and in my case, severely undercooked).   The location is great, but as soon as I saw the prices, I was ready for them to be justified. To say that the prices were NOT justified is to put it mildly. The food consisted of pretentious ideas or simple cuts of meat that were executed at or below an Applebee's level. I had the salmon, and there was absolutely nothing notable about the dish or plating except for an unnecessarily huge glob of butter sitting on the fish, which turned out to be almost completely uncooked. It was uncooked fish, some butter, and some average-tasting pilaf. Comments around the table made it apparent that the other dishes were of similar quality.  Overall: there isn't much of a point to this place. The view is the view, if that's your thing, then wander up and buy a drink, I guess. Do not eat here, it is an egregious, almost inexcusable waste of money. I would have been kinder if the prices did not imply that we should expect utter brilliance.",

We went here after watching a show at the Herberger and I was expecting some high class expensive dining that that is exactly what I got.  The service matched the price tag which was nice to see but the restaurant itself was disappointing.  Not only did they not have Coke or dark rum but they let poor Ashley A order a prime rib and then told her they were all out.    I had the drunken shrimp and they were pretty excellent.  The sauce around them was really good and they were resting on a piece of toast disguised as a crostini.  I also had a few bites of the lava cake but since it was buried under a pound of powered sugar, I couldn't eat any more.  I guess I just agree with Beth S's review...I'm just not seeing what justifies the price.  The District in the Sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this.  Plus, the view there isn't half bad.",

    "text": "Had a lovely anniversary dinner here in September in spite of Restaurant Week.  I say \"in spite of\" because I'm not really a fan of that week.  My few experiences have been at overcrowded restaurants with mediocre service at best.  But we bit the bullet and made a reservation anyway.  First off, let me highly recommend you try to secure a reservation on an evening when a dust storm is blowing in.  Assuming it clears out, all the residual filth in the air will make for a gorgeous sunset.  And like it or not, you're going to pay for that view.  Luckily, I liked it.  I started with a wine trio.  Honestly, I don't remember which one, but anytime someone puts three glasses of wine in front of me at the same time, we're off to a good start.  Then on to the Southwest Caesar.  I love a good Caesar, but the twist with the ancho caesar dressing and shaved manchego was a nice change.  For my entree, a scallop dish with a chipotle sauce.  I forget the name of the sauce, but it's a very sweet sauce, almost syrup-like.  Unfortunately, the chipotle did not come through to balance the sweetness, but the scallops were cooked perfectly.   I finished with my own dessert (I don't share on special occasions), the peach upside down cake.  I LOVE upside down cake, but this one did not live up to my expectations.  The components were all there, but there was no caramelization to the peaches.  And without the golden brown, crusty, sugary top, what's the point of the upside down?   So food was closer to 3.5 stars, but with the great view and fantastic service, a much deserved bump to 4 stars.",

    "text": "So my aunt is visiting from small town Ohio and its restaurant week and I wanted to take her somewhere really cool that would knock her socks off. I hadn't been to the Compass Grill since it was the Compass Room like 10 years ago. But its a rotating restaurant and they sure as hell dont have those in Ohio!   I made reservations through Opentable and requested a window table for our party of 4, which was honored. When we arrived we valet parked because really where do you park in downtown Phoenix? At that point it sure would have been rad if they would have told us it was going to cost $11 to valet! I have valeted my car at numerous restaurants around the valley and its always been complimentary if you were eating at their establishment....Clearly the Hyatt nor the Compass AZ Grill believe in this. (Minus 1 star right there, its like charging a cover to step foot through the doors)   Service was generally pretty slow, and there were hardly any tables there, I am going to say that there were MAYBE 15 other tables. The food was decent but far from mind blowing. It was really pretty average and I am glad we went during restaurant week so we didn't have to pay the higher normal prices, because I would have been pretty upset over the meal.   We put our dessert orders in when we placed our whole meal order (You get 3 courses during RW) After our dinner plates were cleared it took over 20-30 minutes to bring out dessert, kinda crazy. BUT they were very tasty, I will give them that.   All in all it was an OK experience. I didn't have a terrible time but I will probably never go back either. Its cool to take out of towners to because the place rotates and you can see the whole city (Go just before sunset, its wicked!) Also as you rotate there are little plaques posted telling you about the buildings and scenery.",

I had the French onion soup which was cold and basically like Campbell's with a piece of toasted sliced French bread with a small piece of previous melts gruyere cheese on top of the bread only. The Brussels sprouts with bacon jam was okay. It could have been better if it were sprinkled with real bacon bits. We sent back the coke & jack because, the can of coke used must have been lying around had no fizz. They second glass came back a little fizzier but, clearly not from a fresh can of Diet Coke. All in all, I would say this place is not about the food; it's about the view for all tourist trapped in the downtown area trying to find out where they are.",

Was seated at a table away from the rotating Windows.  My boyfriend asked the server on two different occasions if we could get a window seat when the parties left and were told no both times.  Our seating just seemed awkward as we sat facing a couple who sat at the window. Had to look around them to enjoy the view.  Food - For appetizer we ordered the Brie fondue Tasted like velveta cheese and the same bread that you get when you first get seated is served with it. We split the filet it was tasty , portion was on the smaller side but was cooked perfect  Service was slow which would be good however the server hardly came around and when my cocktail drink was emptied she never asked if I wanted another.  Go for a drink or during the reverse happy hour (9-11pm)",

The view is pretty and the rotating part is nice although it feels weird every so often, like it's shaking back and forth ever so slightly to regain its balance but you get used to it. It was a nice touch that they asked my name at the hostess stand and the waitress spoke to me by first name. She was polite but she was gone for 10+ minutes while I sat there with questions about the menu. I finally asked the hostess to get her. She came, was knowledgeable about the menu and the rest of the service was without a hitch. Food took only 13 min and it was delicious. The salmon was cooked to order, amazingly flavorful, not dry, and had a gorgeous crispy skin on it. Bravo. The risotto was cooked perfectly as well and although I didn't care much for the peach sauce or top salad, the salmon really was the star for me here.",

I'll admit that the concept of a revolving 24th floor to see the entire Downtown Phoenix is pretty cool. I also enjoyed the random fact placards that were on the walls as the floor rotated.  We came here for drinks in the afternoon. The drink menu wasn't very extensive and made with non-top shelf liquor. We also ordered the pear arugula pancetta flatbread to share, which was actually pretty good. As far as prices go, pretty steep at $12 per drink and for the flatbread, but no big.  Definitely a place of novelty, but again, could have survived my trip without having to visit this place.",

We ordered the bruschetta as our appatizer. We both had lamb, hers well done and mine medium. These were cooked to perfection! My wife ordered the asparagus for a side and I ordered the heirloom popatoes and both were delicious. We were surprised with a small cheesecake a la mode for dessert. I looked up the sunset time prior to our reservation and the view did not disappoint. Our waiter,Julian, was great! Only deducting one star for the smaller portion lamb compared to other places we've had it. Other than that, it was a great anniversary dinner. Thanks to everyone at Compass Arizona Grill.",

When I got there, there was only a handful of people in the party that had arrived but as more people started showing up, it was clear there wasn't enough room. In the middle of trying to work with the staff to try and make space, the waiter seemed annoyed and decided he wasn't going to take any drink or food requests until everyone had settled in. Once we did order, the wait time extended past the kitchen close time so we're eating around 1030pm. We ordered the ceviche since it was late and we just wanted to get out of there- it was only chunks of scallops in some sort of acid-sweet juice. The chips served with it tasted like the oil they were fried in was old (they tasted burnt, even though they didn't look burnt). The view was nice but the staff seemed unprepared, annoyed and slow. Pretty disappointing for such a pricey restaurant.",

We made mention that it was a special anniversary dinner when we made the reservation and were greeted at the host station and by our server with \"Happy Anniversary\" comments.   When we were seated our server stated that dessert was complimentary in celebration of our special occasion. The cheese and charcuterie board was good but the Caesar salad was a bit sub par, croutons were rock hard and there was too much lemon in the dressing. I had the zucchini corn chowder soup and it was delicious. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich and found it to be perfectly cooked and enjoyed the fact that it was free range and locally sourced.   The view was amazing, especially at night, and our server was fantastic! I'm deducting one star due to the salad, but specifically for the poor selection of IPA (only one and not local). Other than that, it was a wonderful anniversary dinner and definitely worth a trip to Compass Arizona Grill.",

We didn't get our drink orders and bread until approx. 25 minutes in since we sat down. We ordered our entrees as soon as our waiter came back and we didn't manage to get our food until 40 minutes later. During this time our waiter didn't stop by once. Our water was refilled by other servers as ours ghosted us. We asked for our checks and because it took him so long we made a complaint. He comes over and complains about how he's working as fast as he can and that he had a new system he needed to learn how to use and that we needed to be patient. No apology at all. He comes back over a solid 15 minutes later and SLAMS the checks on the table before handing them out. We were a table of 5 which according to the menu did not require the mandatory 18% tip which he added anyways. It's upsetting that our table of 5 where the average check was $70-$80 was forced to tip this man who didn't do his job at all let alone do it well. The manager ended up comping the drinks for us but only because we requested because the whole experience was ubsurd. Now onto the food. The crab cake appetizer was actually very good. From the flavor to the texture of the crab to the puree it was fabulous. The filet mignon with a side of pork belly braised greens is not worth your money. It wasn't medium rare as I requested and the greens were the incredibly bitter. So bitter in fact that I took one bite, spit it out, and didn't eat another. I left a good portion of my steak untouched as well. I would not recommend this place. I will not be returning. The bill was more than $80 and I got an appetizer and an entree with no drink and terrible service. I'm sure you could do better anywhere else. Restaurants like this think because of their specialty (the view) they can make people pay a ton of money for terrible food. Don't let that happen to you, unless the view and experience is worth it for you I guess.",

The service was bad- server wasn't friendly, had to wait along time to get checked up on. Another waiter that wrapped up my left overs placed the box on the floor beside me saying 'I'll just leave this right here for you' - who puts food on the floor ?? They need to train better.

In fact, those two things were fantastic and amazing and prevented me from leaving more disappointed than I would have left had the ambience and service been mediocre.  I was beyond disappointed in the cuisine.  Not only was a bulk of the food luke warm, but items such as the brusell sprouts lacked flavor and other items like the chicken were and risotto were overpowered by mismatched mole sauces and a salad with huge figs that were not at all appetizing.  It was probably the least successful sweet/savory pairing I have ever tasted.  When you go to a place like this and you are spending $25 at minimum a plate it's not about portion size, it's about taste.  If I can't even make it through the meal even when I'm starving, that is a problem.  I would suggest they go back to the drawing board with the food.  I have had better cuisine at my local Culinary Dropout...and they \"dropped out\" of culinary school.",

This was my first visit to the Compass Arizona Grill and I was very excited the days leading to the dinner. This was a special event for me and my girlfriend. It was our 3 year anniversary exactly on that day so I wanted to make it a memorable experience. To start off, I made the reservation about 4 days ahead of time and made two special requests; I wanted to have a window seat with my girlfriend and I requested a \"Happy Anniversary\" type of writing they could do on the dessert plate that we would have after dinner. The window seat request was accommodated so I was happy with that, but I really wanted to make sure the special dessert request was fulfilled.  Here were my attempts to make this happen: 1. When I made my online reservation, I made sure to type up my request for the dessert. There was a fill-in box available for these types of things. 2. I called the day before my reservation to confirm that my request was seen and could be done. I talked to a hostess I believe and she assured me that the \"Happy Anniversary.. \" could be put on a plate. 3. Day of my dinner - Me and my girlfriend are done with our dinner. The waitress at this point now offered us dessert. I said yes please. We get the dessert menu and I am thinking that I just want to go ahead and make sure that everyone is good to go. I smoothly excused myself from the table and went to the bathroom. After exiting the bathroom I talked to the hostess and confirmed with her my request. She pulled up my last name and said she will make sure the server takes care of it.   What happens when the dessert gets to our table.. it doesn't have the lettering.  It does have two candles lit on it and the server did say happy anniversary.  It was nice but I cannot figure out how it didn't get taken care of after making THREE heroic efforts to make it happen!!! lol.  If any of you look at the customer photos for this restaurant you will see that someone got exactly what I wanted! So I know its POSSIBLE!   In the end I didn't get what I tried reallllyyyyyyy hard for, the server dropped a glass cup that shattered right next to me and my girlfriend and the bread was not very warm.  No consistency really with all the food temperature and the steak was pretty chewy.  I will say that the views were great and the rotating restaurant concept was really cool so that is why I didn't give one star .. bottom line.  If they could really improve the service and food, this place could be a 5 star restaurant, because you won't find any other revolving restaurants anywhere in Arizona.",

    "text": "The view was amazing as was the whole \"rotating\" room experience. That was the main reason I made the reservation in the first place. The food menu was secondary but based upon the menu listed I expected a higher quality of food. My whole table ordered at least 2 appetizers, 3 salads, 5 different main dishes, and 3 different desserts.  We all agreed the chef tried to hard with to many ingredients. The flavor profiles just did not work. It felt like if he had left just one of the ingredients off it would of been a good dish. Surprisingly my husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was amazing! I would go back just to order this dish again, he agreed! I had the filet and it tastes almost microwaved, was hard to cut (it was medium rare), and the taste was off. One of our other members raved about the pasta dish. For dessert, as a family, we love the creme brulee. Once again they tried to use to many different ingredients and instead of making a \"classical brulee\" they did 3 small different ones. Two were okay and the other was not what I would consider brulee but they did have a sugar coating on top of it.   Overall the food presentation was beautiful, the taste not so much. For a table of 7 and a bill over 400 I expected much much more.",

The candied prosciutto flatbread was delicious and not skimpy on the toppings (Brie, pear, prosc.) and the charcuterie board was generous and well-curated. (Duck prosciutto, Brie, cheddar, smoked blue cheese [AMAZING], homemade pickles, bar nuts, salame, and prosciutto)   Crab cakes were a lil skimpy, but the excellent cocktail and wine made up for it.   Staff was forthcoming but we sensed some hostility about halfway through the night, we assume bc it was closing and we had ordered three plates :P   For a hotel revolving restaurant, definitely exceeded expectations.",

We had a pear salad after that which was just OK and it was super tiny!  The steak was good but not great. Like a Black Angus quality.  Dessert was the worst part of the meal.  Don't get the cheesecake!  It was not good at all and really tiny. They also charged us 7.50 to split our meal. Which we share a meal at every restaurant we eat at and no one ever charges us ( even at fancier restaurants with better food).  So really if you're going here get the flat bread and a drink and enjoy the view. I would skip dinner.",

    "text": "We came here for our anniversary, with a reservation. Not sure we needed one as there were a number of open tables, at sunset, on a Friday night. It's an experience and a good place to celebrate something. We were seated immediately and our waitress Karla was on top of things. As others have stated, your water glass is refilled almost as you are drinking. We had the pesto bruschetta, chicken sandwich and mixed green salad. We liked it all although it wasn't like the greatest thing we've ever eaten. Portions are decent. Her white peach sangria was way strong and we diluted multiple times. Luckily there was water. Wait, you need more? Here's more.  The whole thing is kind of pricey for what it is but it's not ridiculous. We saw the sunset at just the right time where we were seated, so that worked well.  We waited some for our check as it had gotten busier. I had put down anniversary on our reservation and Karla brought a berry cheesecake slice out, which was nice...we didn't remind her or anything.  Parking is a hassle. The garage was \"closed\" cause it was \"full\" so we ended up just using the valet, which parked at...the garage. You might be able to get your garage ticket validated at the restaurant for free parking but all our valet validation got us was $2 off the valet price, so that kind of sucked. There was no surface metered parking available right around there when we were there. The valet kid was nice but we felt a little taken advantage of.  Overall an experience and decent food, paying to watch the sun go down in a high air conditioned room in the middle of summertime in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Humiliated, disgusted, and amazed at the lack of professionalism! I have stayed at this hotel many times. I have always enjoyed the atmosphere and hospitality that I have received in the past. \"In The Past\" Hyatt has definitely seen a change in its customer satisfaction I had an unfortunate incident, and when I requested to speak with the General manager to resolve the issue of several specific charge disputes I was refused.  Only after my own research was I able to leave a message for the General Managers assistant.  I have yet to receive an explanation for charges, an accurate charge, or communication from anyone from this restaurant and Hyatt Hotel. The incident was that there was \"1\" bottle of wine that was misrepresented to myself and guest who unintentionally ordered a bottle of wine for the amount of $545.00  Now I can appreciate a good wine, but I was not prepared for this purchase nor was I expecting this charge. To my surprise when I received the bill for $595.00 I requested to speak to the manager. I requested from manager to review the menu with me and to discuss an option for payment as I did not have the immediate means to$595.00 on me at that moment and that I would gladly leave my card and drivers licence with home till morning when I would return with payment. He inexcusably humiliated my guest and I in front of other guest, staff, and each other by making us sit there for an hour and a half before calling the police to have me arrested for theft. I over and over again explained that I was able and willing to pay for the wine I just had to wait for bank to open or for credit card to release funds.  I showed the manager my checking account which had a balance of $547,563.21 and that I would gladly pay for the wine that I disputed purchasing in the first place to avoid getting incarcerated by the local police department. The police were very kind and compassionate to the situation while they escorted us from the Hotel. The next morning I reviewed my credit card charges only to find that the Hotel had charged me 14 times in the amount of $1200.00!!! Not one charge attempt for $545.00! When I called and emailed the manager with bank statements and requested his review and to give me a explanation for the charges... Did he respond  No!! I travel very frequently, as well as being a member and employee of AAA I would not recommend this establishment.",

I have never seen the place super busy, except for holidays like the 4th or valentines.  The food is good, but a bit overpriced for the quality.  The filet mignon is good, but not fantastic.  It is tender though. Like I said, you pay more for the view.  The Pork Tenderloin was amazing last night, the sauce and everything was super good, but the apple cabbage salad was awful.  Substitute it.  It is so peppered and there is hardly any apple.  I expected Sweet and started coughing and needed water.  I scrapped it off and just enjoyed the Brie Polenta and Meat.  We also got the truffle Mac n Cheese and that was fabulous too. Small fancy portions, good presentation.  Its just your typical fancy food, meat and potatoes place with a great view.  It can get a little warm with the glass and the sun hitting you just right.  It takes a full 45 minutes to go all the way around.   The service was great, the food was good, the wait for the food was a bit too long.  I think they assume from the view that you don't mind.  But it did take way too long for 3 medium rare meats. The lobster chowder is fantastic.",

I had a salad w chicken...should have not asked for the nasty chicken. Salad was great though. He had some sandwich not worth mentioning. I asked for apple crown royal, but was serve crown royal with apple juice...which I found out about after the 2nd drink. I was wondering why it was so sweet. Tip: ask for Robert to be your server!!!

It's a high end restaurant so of course it's going to be pricey, it's like complaining about the smell of fish at a sea food restaurant.   My girlfriend ordered the filet mignon cooked medium well and I had the flat iron steak medium rare. We both shared the meat and cheese appetizer as well as a bread basket. The meat and cheese platter was delicious and kept us busy while we waited for our main dishes. I especially enjoyed the pickled cauliflower and everything from the tangy cheese and sweet jam all went really well with each other when mixed together. We went to town on the bread basket that came with whipped butter, whipped honey butter and salt. The honey butter was the first to go and the cornbread that came in the bread basket was an unexpected but delicious surprise. The staff was awesome at keeping our water flowing and keeping our table clean in between courses. My flat iron steak was cooked exactly how I asked it to be and it was delicious, along with the asparagus and sauces that garnished my plate. I had some of the left over filet mignon from my girlfriend's plate and that too was nice and tender and seasoned well. My girl also really enjoyed her strawberry cooler that she got. At the end of our meal we got a complimentary birthday dessert. I went with the sweet potato pie parfait. It had a few pieces of caramelized bacon on top that complimented the rest of the dessert.  The view of course was something unique to Compass and that along with the good food and great service will have us coming back.",

Oh - BTW - I tried from other dishes, so I didn't order 100lbs of food. The toasted, carmelized brussels were one of the best and they had a decent wine menu.

My uncle was well known among the staff and we always received outstanding service along with amazing food and a breathtaking view. So when it came to making dinner reservations with my spouse, for me, it was a no brainer. I loved this place and wanted him to love it too. Unfortunately our experience was not what I was expecting. Our waitress, who never introduced herself, seem annoyed by our presence. I thanked her a handful of time without ever receiving a single response or even a head nod. I thought maybe she was in a bad mood but she greeted all of her other tables with a smile and small talk. To add to that we were the only table that didn't receive the complimentary bread and butter. I ordered a medium-rare steak and received a medium-well steak instead. Definitely not a $50 worthy steak. I felt the service we received was so awful that we opted not to eat dessert or stay for drinks as planned and to leave as soon as we received our bill, feeling very disappointed in our dinner and visit. I felt awful for tipping our waitress so low but I tipped her what I thought she deserved. Although I did tip our server assistant $20 for at least responding with \"you're welcome\" after thanking her for refilling my water. She was a sweet girl. Not sure I feel about coming back to this restaurant. Definitely a ton of amazing restaurants downtown to choose from for our next outing.",

Even now I cant stop talking about the best view I have got of the entire city and revolving 360 degrees... JUST LOVE IT.  We both are vegeterians and this is always a problem when we dont find good vegeterian food(we end up having chesse pizza) But, this was totally totally a different experience for us. We had our stomach full by the time we left the restaurant and each and every dish was so tasty and delicious. More importantly I am so happy that my husband just loved it and we both were just looking at the whole view of the city, and enjoying our dinner. We also loved the fact that it revolves and I must say that this is the best restaurant we have been to in the last couple of years in Phoenix. Also, the price is way much lesser than what we have spent for food in some other restaurants which was not worth it.   Thank you so much compass arizona grill for your welcoming smiles, the best view and tasty food.. We will definitely visit this place again.",

Overall, we had a great experience with the atmosphere and the staff was very accommodating. My only complaint was the food and drink. The beer was served warm a few times to our friends that were there celebrating with us, the mushroom pasta was incredibly bland, the vegetables were not cooked thoroughly, and the mixed drinks were also warm. I'm not sure if maybe the glasses had just come out of the dishwasher or what - but we had to keep taking ice from the water and put it in the drinks. Lastly, the staff at the host stand/answering phones were not very friendly and kind of rude in seating us and answering our questions like we were bothering them. I don't know if I'll be back, but my parents enjoyed their time - and that's all the matters.",

My only complaint is the price to food quality. Meal portions are small but expensive. Everything is prepared well but I've eaten just as good for a lot cheaper. I guess you pay to sit 24 stories up in a revolving restaurant.  Dad was happy, though, and thoroughly enjoyed himself.",

Just inside of that first row, where you're staring at the people by the window  Of course, you hope you land the row by the window, otherwise it defeats the point of coming to Compass.  Make sure to request a window table if you make a reservation in advance.  The steak was excellent.  The salmon was so-so.    Definitely a cool place to go once for a birthday, anniversary, etc.  But now somewhere you would go on a regular basis.",

If that wasn't bad enough, I ordered the Truffled Mushroom Bolognese which was dry as a bone; while the mushrooms did have a nice flavor, the pasta itself was dry and flavorless.

I would love to give this place five stars except:  1) It's not as tall as many other revolving restaurants. If I recall, it's only around 25 floors high. 2) The food was kind of meh, but it could be what our event planner ordered.",

I made reservations for 6:30pm, had to wait because two other couples before us but empty tables???  We were dressed up for the type of restaurant that we thought was an elegant and not to mention a pricey menu. The staff I thought would be dressed better for the restaurant, I feel we were over dressed and my new fiance asked me before we were seated if I was sure I wanted to come here. We got seated ordered our food, came a little slow. The food was good and my fiance got full and was excited to have the leftovers to take home for lunch the next day, check came & we asked about the unfinished food and the waiter through it away. Since when do you throw things away that we pay for & over priced.  My fiance said again I would have been a lot happier if we went somewhere else where the menu fit the atmosphere, we won't be going back.",

Our server was nice but not engaged due to all the tables she had to wait on. Food was not worth the prices they charge. I had the steak medallion's $35 for three pieces and some grilled potatoes $13. Easily I could have enjoyed a huge ribeye anywhere else. Bare minimum service, no follow up, just the bill.  The only hook is the views you get, and plan for sundown, cause anytime before you'll get blinded for 30 mins. If you're a tourist, it's worth the one and done....",

I have childhood memories of leaning on the big glass windows admiring the whole valley from the circulating dining room. Thats right, the whole restaurant rotates giving diners a 360 view of the entire valley! After a fast shoot up the epic elevator you arrive to the wonderful Compass Grill. Its not a super fancy restaurant but you would never look over dressed. The food quality has changed over the years and I would say right now things are on the up and up! I ordered the braised venison shank. Ive never seen that on any menu! It was amazing. Braised to perfection, the juicy meat fell right off the bone. I went with the family for my birthday including nieces and nephew under 2 yrs old. It was great, they loved the views, being able to walk around in our \"couch/table area\" also there was a ladies group having a fun time at the restaurant so the kids could make all the noise they wanted and still were not heard!  Everyone in my group had a great meal, was impressed with the food and attentive service. This place continues to be a staple for a wonderful dinner experience in Arizona. The monsoon rolling in plus lightning show was just epic!",

The seafood pasta was astringent tasting, and the chicken was bland and lifeless. The bread was the only redeeming quality.

One cheese (some dried out herbed Brie and very little of it). One meat (prosciutto). A huge stack of bread (4 thick olive oil slices and four thick brown nut bread) four huuuuge pickled onions (inedible really - a thinly shaved version would have paired better with the bread and meats), four dill pickle slices, and some admittedly delicious jam.   It was pretty awful. I was interested in seeing other pics of it and sure enough, there are other pics of overflowing platters of delicious meat and cheese filled boards which made it even more insulting.   I mean, if you put an order in for your customer and you find out the kitchen ran out of half the meat and cheese, be straight up. Right? Offer a different option or price it accordingly.   Nice view of the city. Nice enough bartender waited on us. Just too tired to raise the issue last night. I hope they glean something from my review and strive to improve late night food options. It's such a pretty view and nice central location.",

There's always different options to choose from so the menu is definitely accommodating.

The bread basket with cornbread was probably the best part, as I typically don't like cornbread- this was awesome! For main course, I ordered the seafood pasta. Sadly it looked better than it tasted.

    "text": "First time here and what a wonderful experience. Had a reservation at 530 which is the sweet spot. You get to see the city while the sun is still up, sunset, and night time with a complete 360 view of downtown and beyond. Service was excellent and very attentive. Carla (maybe with a K?) was wonderful and made sure drinks were refilled and everything came out as ordered and explained some of the items to us. We had a party of 5 for a graduation and we started with the calamari which was a large plate full and more than enough for everybody. And the size of the calamari were big too. Not skimpy or just pure breaded. We ordered the salmon, seafood pasta, filet, and ribeye. It was al very delicious. For some items, you got an option of sauce to top it with, only recommendation I would make is maybe have a chefs recommendation next to the menu item with what sauce pairs best, but it is nice to have three different options to top with. The main items were all delicious and cooked to order. The sides were almost better than the main dishes themselves. The mashed potatoes were great and oh my god, the bacon-Brie macaroni was amazing. I'm a big mac and cheese fan, and this is definitely top 3. For dessert we got the black and white cake. It's very sweet and thick so a couple of bites and I was down for the count so it's best to split it. All in all in was a great experience and definitely something every native Arizonan or tourist should check out especially for the views of the 360 degree rotating restaurant.",

It has AMAZING views of Phoenix, is a nice relax/romantic setting and its got the spinning element which is different from any other restaurant in the sky that I have been to. This place has so much potential, but I feel lacks important things like delicious food. Nothing on their menu is to rave about and you think it would be when looking at the prices. I dont mind spending a pretty penny on a good night, but those nigths I usually leave the resturant thinking I ate pieces of heaven haha. Unfortuantly eating here I left unsatisfied. 2 stars for the food/lack of service and an extra star for the view and ambiance.",

We were told it takes about 50 minutes to do a complete rotation.  The restaurant menu has a good selection with some high end selections as well as some more moderately priced options. I went with the Truffled mushroom bolognese and a small Southwest Caesar salad. The salad was tiny and what made it look even smaller was the large plate it was on. And the salad wasn't anything special except for being a little spicy. The pasta dish was good but not big on flavors.   Service was decent. Our waiter was a little too excitable and it got to be somewhat annoying at times but he was friendly and helpful with dinner selections.  But the best thing about this is the view so my suggestion is go for the view. I'm sure there's better food in Phoenix.",

I looked up the menu on line and it is not what we got, unless you look at the photos of the menu people post you will not see the current pricing.  Be ware you also pay $15.00 to valet.

I had this huge elaborate day planned for my boyfriend (now fiance), for our one year anniversary. Our dinner was set to be at this location, as I had heard it from a friend and it would be a new experience for the two of us. The day went perfectly and dinner was just the same.   I was thankful we sat at a seat by the window, as we got to look at the plaques informing us of the direction we were facing (which was cool!). Phoenix isn't that pretty looking from above, and we even saw some birds fighting over fries - but my goal was to watch the sun dissipate while the night-life slowly come to life, which was also exactly what happened.  We both ordered a sandwich and split the other half, but we liked the sandwich the other had ordered. We skipped desert.   It's so cheesy to say, but overall walking out of the hotel and down the street to our car was just the most perfect ending to the night. He said it was the best anniversary he's ever had. Given the food's price, I would recommend people come here for anniversaries, events, or a 'treat yo self' experience.",

With the reflections from the room and the distance from the glass I could not appreciate the view that we drove 35 miles to see. I asked the server if we could be moved before the food was even ordered. He responded that he would ask the host. He can back a minute later and said that it was not possible because there were no tables available.   During the entire dinner, I noticed 2 tables to the right of us that were unoccupied even as we departed. I also noticed a couple that sat up by the window and became uncomfortable with the spinning room and their server moved them to another table without asking anyone.  Never in my life have I felt I had to stiff a server but this is a well-deserved life lesson. I will not be back.",

We were walking around downtown for a while and couldn't wait to eat, so we grabbed a piece of pizza on the street below, but wanted to have a fancy desert. We got up the the Compass, were seated and told our server that we had dinner, but would like to see the desert menu. Our obviously annoyed server went directly to the manager and had a few words. After a minute she came by and asked us to leave, since we had dinner reservations, and weren't eating dinner we needed to leave.   I'd completely understand this if the restaurant were full, and we wouldn't have even wanted to be seated if people were waiting. There was literally 1 other table seated. We were surrounded by empty tables.   They refused to serve us on some stupid technicality. They just didn't want our money. We continued on our way and had ice cream at a place down on the street.    Get bent Compass, you exist in downtown Phoenix, get over yourself and serve your customers.",

    "text": "As an Arizona native I had much anticipated this iconic location! A group of us gathered for a sentimental celebration at this staple and couldn't wait for the experience. We arrived early and to our surprise we were able to be sat early while awaiting our final guest. Sat about 15 minutes early to our reservation, we ordered a round of drinks to get the evening started.   Nearly 25 minutes later our drinks had not arrived as our final guest joined us. Not exactly sure where the bar is located, however I could have gone home for a glass of wine and been back in the time it took for our first round to arrive. Once ready to start with some appetizers, we decided to share two starters which looked great when they arrived. The lobster bisque was cold for our guest which was sent back and replaced with a temperature accurate dish. We're now over an hour in, and just finished a salad. This is where we should have ended the night.  For our next course we decided to order a bottle of wine, and a beer while that wine came. Another 15 minutes pass, no beer, no wine - and the wine we selected was unavailable. With no additional recommendation by the server, we had to request the wine list to make another selection. Still no beer delivered at this point, we chose another wine and I arrived shortly after the beer.   We were excited to try the Cedar River meat selection as one of our guests lived in Colorado and was highly anticipating a delicious meal. The group split two entrees when the ribeye was recommended by a servers assistant which we requested sliced to share. Once our meals arrived the steaks weren't sliced to share, and one guests side of potatoes was cold.   Beyond frustrated at this point with the timing of all of the delays and excuses (what turned into a 3 hour ordeal) we kept our mouths shut and continued on. We received the best service by a gal who wasn't even our server, great personality, informative and engaging. Our server did not have a professional appearance or demeanor, and we felt our party was an inconvenience to her evening.   The view and ambiance is not worth the price; the horrifically glacial pace of every course, the bread coming out after our salads, 30 minutes for a basic round of drinks, and no manager present to speak with on the concerns of our evening have us taking business elsewhere in the future. $300 gets you a lot in this town, there was not one portion of the evening that left us enticed to return. Having to ask for spoons for soup, fresh silverware, salt and pepper for a salad, sweetener for iced tea-this is basic stuff that I shouldn't have to request. This is by far the worst experience we have encountered to date.",

The only minor issue was our waitress was on the uppity/condescending  side and not all that friendly. Her assistant was very good, however.  After the meal I realized WHY our waitress had an attitude.....a tip of 18% was automatically added to the bill!!    Based on her service, I was thinking more on the lines of 10%-12%. I considered raising this issue, but didn't want to ruin our Valentines Day evening....so I begrudgingly paid it. Hopefully we'll get a friendlier waitress/waiter next time, or better yet....they will change their policy to let the customer decide what the tip should be! I think the waitress/waiter attitude would be drastically different if it were a customer determined tip.",

The waitress seemed to have too many tables or something because she spent like half a second at each table before booking it. I would be mid sentence and she would just say okay and bolt???? Super weird and we had to call her back several times to finish a thought.   The view was amazing and definitely worth it, especially at night.   Overall, I really enjoyed the experience, the atmosphere, and the food. However the service was glacial. We were at the restaurant for two hours and we didn't even order dessert!",

I ordered a glass of the Meiomi and my friend ordered a Phoenix Flirt. We also ordered the Cheesecake. That's all we ordered because college students over here. Let me tell you, the wine was amazing, the mix drink was great, and the cheesecake was just right. Right as we were finishing our meal our server came up to us and told us that they took care of the bill and to have happy 21st! The bill should have come to about $36 ish dollars according to their price but this is one restaurant I would recommend to my friends and family. The staff feels happy to be there like someone is taking care of them which combined with the food gives me much respect for the management. The view is amazing, go for sunsets and evening dinners (10/10). The entire place just has a great atmosphere about it. I will be coming back both while I'm in college (with limited money) and after I graduate later this year!! Thank you the Compass Family",

That nut bread is gross. My boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken sandwich. That should also be served on a different bread because the bread was too thin for that thick of a chicken. The waitress wasn't very friendly, and the lady who kept coming to refill our water glasses came around like every 5 minutes, even when our water wasn't that low, so it got to be annoying. We just decided to stop drinking it so we wouldn't keep being interrupted.",

The prickly pear margarita was delicious, but I wouldn't have been able to afford more than one or two! I got the chicken flatbread appetizer as an entree and it was much bigger than any of my friends' entrees. I thorougly enjoyed it: large chunks of cheese and chicken, very flavorful, and enough for two full meals. Can't beat that!",

Not to mention, their servings are also small. While view might also be good, the place constantly moving can be dizzying especially on your first time.",

Seemed like the clientele varied from people who are clearly accustomed to nicer dining establishments (well-dressed, quiet conversation, polite table manners) and people who don't know how to behave in classy dining establishments (drunken table near us seemed to think they were at a bar/club, and several other tables contained guests in athletic wear, shorts, and/or flip-flops). Waitstaff was professional and formal. Portions were larger than what you usually see at this level of dining.",

The desert was delicious.My husband had the banana cream pie which comes in a small mason jar I had the gelato vanilla which tastes like vanilla bean ice cream. my husband had the salmon plate. It was a small portion of food but he really enjoyed it and a green salad. I had the mixed greens salad and a Burger which was ok. the wait staff was extremely friendly ( shout out to Anthony our waiter).   the two dinners plus three cocktails totaled $103 all in all it was a nice evening if I were to return with out-of-town guests I would just take them for drinks and desert. Cozy tables for two and also there are couch style booths all of which overlook  phoenix  definitely a beautiful view. I'm sure since it's  located directly across from the convention center, there is parking but we were very lucky and found metered parking in front of the Hyatt Regency hotel entrance. We paid for 2 hours worth of parking which was just enough time to eat and get a photo opt to remember our date night.",

Ordered:   Caprese flatbread - delicious and large portion  Mixed Grill - they ran out of the lamb so they replaced it with the filet. not sure what the lamb tasted like. Everything on there was delicious though. good portion size   Creme Brulee Trio - the sugar on top covers up the flavors of the creme brulee. even without the sugar, i couldn't taste the green tea one. wouldnt recommend.   Only CON i have is that they did take a while to bring the food out. The restaurant was pretty empty so not sure why. It didnt bother me has much because of the fantastic view and friendly staff.   Highly recommend for a date just be prepared to pay a little more.",

The food and drinks were great, but the staff definitely made the experience for me and my boyfriend. We had one employee (I wish I could remember his name, but he had curly dark hair and glasses) who made a couple recommendations on drinks and then made some of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. He was very friendly and helped my BF and I out the whole night. It's awesome when you can get top notch customer service like that at a restaurant!",

I mean $7 for a Caesar salad is a bit much especially when it's not that huge of a portion. I got the chicken and it was good. Nothing to write home about. The service was good I just wasn't super super impressed. I'm not sure if it's because I worked out about an hour prior to coming to this place but I was still hungry.  I think for the price you pay you should get a big portion but that's just me.",
