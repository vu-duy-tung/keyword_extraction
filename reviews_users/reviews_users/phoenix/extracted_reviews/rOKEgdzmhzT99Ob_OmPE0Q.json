The only reason I'm not giving them a 1 star is because they used to be really good and I hope they fix their menu. I personally wont be going back to this location. Other locations still have good food!",

    "text": "Ah, happy hour with the same people I spend more time with than my own family. What a treat! We're always on the lookout for a centrally located bar/restaurant to meeting with our various coworkers, who are spread out from the Biltmore, Midtown, Downtown and Gateway (and some times Mesa). Zipp's Indian School fit into our rotation this month.   This location has been open only a couple of weeks, from what I heard, and they seemed to have pretty much everything down. The service was good, the beers were awesome (the tap beers didn't have their own menu, which I'd prefer. But I had a dark ale and for the life of me cannot remember what it was because two large beers later and I was toast...1557 or something like that). It's loud inside, so this wouldn't be a location to consider if you're planning an important business transaction...unless, of course, that business transaction had something to do with cement boots and Tempe Town Lake. Since I had a late lunch, I wasn't hungry but my fellow coworkers enjoyed their onion rings and chicken strips.   Nothing too impressive about the bathrooms. The stalls have very low doors so you can't see if anyone's in there, and if you happen to be like me and try a door that isn't locked you'll walk in on a lightweight hurling. Blech! And the single urinal seems like a lack of consideration, considering this place is a sports bar and beer flows freely. But, I guess that's what male bonding is all about. Right? IDK.   Parking is at a premium during happy hour, so plan accordingly. I lucked out and landed rock star parking because I made a few laps around the lot.   We'll likely return here for a future happy hour. Until then, good luck in the parking lot, drink well, and don't tap the keg until you're good and ready.",

This is one of the reasons I like this place, because I can be one of those douchebags.  On Sundays it gets PACKED here. My friends snagged a spot early today so I just pulled up a chair to their table. You can hardly walk around the place. Normally this would anger me, but if I can see my football team play I could care less.  They have all the televisions labeled with the games of the day so you can make sure you have a good view of your team's game. From what I've been told, the owner seems to be a Patriots fan, because almost every Sunday that is the game that has the sound streaming. Totally fine by me.  If you are going to watch the Cardinals game, GET THERE EARLY. Or else you will be standing at the entrance squinting at the televisions, waiting for your table to be ready.  Food is typical bar food. They have specials on Sundays on drinks and food so you don't spend a lot of money getting trashed and trash talking the Dallas (or whatever team you despise) fan next to you.  If you like to enjoy a football game without people looking at you like you are crazy, this is the place to go.",

On Saturday and Sunday you can take advantage of their hangover specials from 11am-4pm. See why I love this bar?  The food here is hit or miss. If you stick with the appetizers, wings, and burgers you'll be okay. I just tried the big zip burger with tartar sauce and it was amazing! I know tartar sauce on a burger sounds weird but it was really good and not as weird as it sounds.   The bar serves beer, wine, liquor. I highly recommend trying a margarita. They taste just like Z TEJAS and they only let you have 3. Skip the bloody marys they smell like garbage.  This is a good place to watch Sunday football. You can yell as loud as you want and people don't look at you like you're crazy. Sometimes I yell for the fun of it. Sunday's are busy make sure you get here early so you can get a good table.",

Pizza was burnt. Although it tasted good just was a off night I will assume. The hamburger is huge but full of flavor. Single patty price is alittle high when you compare it to the normal double burger price. Beer prices are great. Margarita is perfect. It's a sports grill but definitely not geared for a family dining. Which is disappointing. Families like to watch sports together. I would never bring my kids into this atmosphere.",

The restuarant was not super busy.  Our server was not attentive at all.   During our dining we had to continuously remove all of our own glassware, and dirty plates. Literally 6 empty glasses at a time.   Then she forgot our second drink order. When she finally got around to bringing it, I asked her for a pickle. She rudley smirked and said, \"we do not have pickles.\"  I know this was not even True since probably 98% of all sportsbars in America have pickles.   I was a little upset about the service.  I have worked in the hospitality industry for years, and the places I have worked have high standards. You learn to keep tables clear of all dirty items, and you try to accomodate your guests with the things they ask for.    When she brought the bill it was $70. We still left her a $10. tip. My boyfriend wrote her a little note just explaining why it was only $10.   We eat out all the time. We are usually very generous tippers.  If the service was up to standard, and attentive as it should have been, her tip would have been double.   I am sorry Zipps. Im not super eager to return.",

Since I was there for just a take out order, I advised her I wanted to see a menu and would like to place an order to go. She promptly offered one, and gave me a few moments to peruse it and see what I might like. At 11:08 p.m., I place my order for wings, medium, buffalo style, to go. She keyed the information into the computer and advise me it would be a short while to wait. The place was not busy at all. The kitchen was still open. At 11:18pm, my order of wings were put in the pick up window. They were packaged in a to go box and ready for me to leave with but the socialite bartender was too busy flirting with other customers to take notice of the food which needed to be picked up. 20 more minutes went by. My food was still sitting in the window, untouched. No one from the kitchen rang a bell and identified that the food was ready. The bartender never gave me a second look because I was not ordering drinks from her. This is not the way a restaurant should be run. I understand completely the socialization which is done between a bartender and her customers. The fact that I fell through the cracks and was completely forgotten about is unacceptable.  At 11:43 p.m., with the bartenders back turned to me, I walked out. The food is probably still sitting in the hot window waiting to be picked up. I have no desire to go back for it or ever to go back to this establishment again.  Shame on you Zipps!",

This place is for happy hour & for watching sports if you care about sports. The patio is nice too, but I avoid it since people smoke out there. blech  There's always has been room for anywhere from 5-15 of us to get a table. They are great about letting you pull tables together too. Some places are so rude about that.  It's never cramped & the place is clean. There's usually a cool mix of people in & no douchey attitude.   I must recommend a Zipparita if you've never tried one. I don't usually do a frozen margarita, but I make an exception for this one. Let's just say they put a limit on how many you can buy for a reason.  They do lose a star for not having Tito's vodka. Seriously Zipps, please fix that issue right away.   I am in here at least once every couple of weeks. If you see me, come say hi & buy me a Zipparita...and nachos and wings. Ok kidding, you only have to buy me a Zipparita. :)",

I mean I don't rave about wings that often but these were super super good. Mad Props to our server Paige for the suggestion. Ice cold 32 oz mugs of Blue Moon, got to watch the Saturday Games on plenty of TV's. Service was excellent, food was good plenty of seating and good atmosphere for a game day.

When you get the wings and celery you should get enough dressing for your meal.  They bring you a little side of Bleu cheese about the size of two thimbles.  When you ask for extra they charge 50 cents for another.  One night I ordered the chicken burrito and it comes with tortilla chips with the same size salsa.  I ordered extra salsa thinking it would be 50 cents but no.. they charged 75 cents.  So tonight we went in and brought a small amount of Bleu cheese and the manager came over and told us we can't bring that in.  Guess what !!!  We will not be back!!!!",

The bartender was very apologetic, gave me a beer and asked if I still wanted the salad.  I said sure, and she came back to tell me it would be another 10-15 minutes!  Not sure what happened, but a lack of kitchen management is a likely start.  The entire bar was waiting over an hour for any order, and the place was not even half full.  Needless to say, I cannot recommend this place and have found other places for my weekday luncheons.  I was offered coupons from the management, but why bother?

Today, I went to Arcadia Zipps on Indian School and 38st and I was served with ugly looking dried wings with no hot sauce. I asked for sauce and they poured cold sauce over my already cold wings and brought them back to me in one second.  I complained and I felt very uncomfortable when all waitresses were staring at me for an obvious reason. I am sure the owner is not aware of what's going on on this venue.  Zipps is a very well known and recognized venue in Arizona.  Let's make this place more enjoyable for the Arcadia area.",

Our food came, nachos burnt to a crisp with nothing on them. This is absurd, we have been to the zipps in Scottsdale and Ahwatukee.

I was feeling tipsy but oh so good from my yummy drink so I decided to get some food.   I got pizza and fries. If nothing else Zipps should be given the Nobel Prize just for offering such a combo.   I've never really had a TRUR friend before. Someone I could lean on wen times are rough or someone to talk to when I'm having a bad day. I've never had that go-to guy who would let me cry on their shoulder. Here's hoping Zipps will fill the void!  I cannot recommend enough. This place is ideal for weddings, bachelorette parties, bat mitzvahs,   Quinceaneras, birthday parties and of course grandma and grandpas 80th wedding anniversary!

    "text": "Let me start off this review is 110% based off service. I went to Zipps on Indian School Rd. 3 nights in a row for the Pac-12 Basketball tournament. On the 3rd night I was completely insulted by the bartender with glasses  (Aleah) who cannot properly fill a beer at a bar (I did not complain even though she filled my 32oz glass full of foam, at least 4oz worth). At the end of the night, after I had paid and was just finishing my beer, she tries to converse with me. She starts out asking me \"what do I do work for?\" I replied I work retail at a tactical store and that I was in the Marines for four years prior. I did not tell her I struggle with PTSD after serving two deployments as its no ones business but my own. The next things out of her mouth is... \"So you get paid hourly, right?\" And I replied \"yes\" and then she says \"Oh well thats great for you because I get paid in tips.\" She said some other things after that but needless to say she was commenting at the tip i left her which was 20%. She then whispers to the bartender next to her (the blonde with pigtails) if her comment wasn't to abrupt and out of line as if I didn't exist. The blonde told her she was fine. Keep in mind this WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.   I have never been so disrespected by service in my life. I will never go back to Zipps on Indian School Road, and the fact that they wash glasses right in front of you at the bar is pretty disgusting as well, water did hit me in the process, but I did not complain.   Food review: For better wings I'd recommend the attic down the road (order the lousiana style) and for a better bar i'd recommend \"the bar\" right up the road.",

We came just as Happy Hour had finished (note: if you actually make it for Happy Hour, there are some AWESOME deals on food and drinks), and the place was packed out for the game.  Despite this, Zipps quickly cleared us a place at a booth and we were greeted promptly and with a smile.  Our waitress even made an attempt to continue the Happy Hour prices for us (\"if Happy Hour is still going on, we actually have those drinks for $3\") but I was an idiot and corrected her so we paid full price.  Dang honesty.  Anyway, the menu is standard sports fare, but instead of marking up the price to make the place seem for fancy, Zipps has kept reasonable prices for what they're selling.  One of the menus stated that Zipps doesn't believe in $12 burgers.  I don't either, so we're totally on the same page there.  I had an order of the medium wings, which were similar to those at Hooters in meat-to-sauce ratio and just as tasty.  I also tried a Zipparita, which is a delicious white frozen drink that is super cheap during Happy Hour and still surprisingly cheap during normal hours.  Very pleased by the food and service at Zipps, especially for the cost.",

Sometimes the focaccia.  They're sides have always sucked.  O rings and fries are disgusting. So I usually get a salad.  Last few times I've gotten wings, extra crispy (yes I know it takes 20 minutes) they were not even close to crispy, just rubbery nastiness. So I eat one or two and take them home to cook them. Additionally, the last time there was barely any sauce on them, so you have to ask for extra not a big deal but a far cry from what once was...  As for the burgers, they changed the patty a few years back and use a smaller bun . So, frankly after trying twice a year or two back I just don't order them anymore. There are far better burgers all over town.   So at this point they can't even make wings correctly which means I don't give them my money anymore.  Booooooooooo!",

We both got zipparitas, which were pretty good for a machine blended margarita, and a great price. I would definitely come back for happy hour and to try out the food. Wish there was more variety of games on.",

It seems that every seat in the place has a view of at least a dozen screens, and whoever has the biggest party gets the BIG screen and sound...but really now, are you there to listen?  I ordered the Golden Wings, as they seemed to be one of the specialties, as are the burgers, but I was here for the wings! The lovely Miss Chelsea cautioned against going with the scorcher and suggested I get the mild sauce, but get the hot on the side. Nice move, but learned that for this gringo anyway, I survived. No problamo! Note: the side cost me $0.50.  Are you kidding me?!  I'll do it again tho, for the extra sauce was needed for these very meaty little wings that could pass for quail legs!! Got the cheese sticks for a cool down, which reminded me of eggrolls; nice change from the typical battered numbers.   Wrapping up, the lovely Miss Chelsea asked if I wanted desert. WHAT?! I couldn't resist the Brownie, but also couldn't finish it...so good! I'll be back.",

Too bad because the wings  when done properly, are on par with best I've had in town.   They need some new management to get things straightened out. I get feeling current managers don't care.

Which stinks because we used to frequent the one in north scottsdale NIGHTLY years ago before the kiddos came :) We were looking for a quick bite to eat at the start of a date night, and my husband suggested zipps so he could watch a game. Hot wings? Don't have to ask me twice.  It was rockin, but we got seated pretty quickly. Our server was nice, but horrible. I used to be a server, so I have much higher patience than my husband. (Who started to resemble Wolverine when the server didn't show up before happy hour ended so we could order more beers) Our food took forever to come out. Again, I'm not nitpicky.  We ordered onion rings (they were actually cold, and tasted stale. How can something fried go so horribly wrong?) and wings ( THANKFULLY those were as awesome as i remember). I was still hungry, so I got a basic burger. EEW. It tasted like JackintheCrack. you know the spongy tasteless meat? that's what I got. and without the toppings I ordered it with. Nothing makes me more grumpy than bad food that doesn't even have the mustard/mayo you ordered on it!  Only good thing here was the wings. Don't go here for food. Drinks/t.v.s ONLY",

The restaurant might have had 8 tables busy at the lunch hour.  The waiters was very nice but service from the kitchen was really slow.  We ordered the burger with a chili and pepper jack cheese, a basket of fries and sweet potato chips, and a BLT. We both ordered Ice tea.  We sent the ice tea back because it tasted as it if it had been filtered through a mold screen. I commented that the ice tea  container might not have been cleaned recently. I got water and my friend ordered a Coke. I got my water but the Coke arrived as a sprite. That is a waitress issue.  My burger tasted as it was not fully cooked but on checking it seemed to be properly cooked. I kept eating it but kept thinking this might be a bad idea.   My friend sent the french fries back because they were just barely cooked. I tried one and sure enough, almost raw potato. The sweet potato chips on the other had were cooked to death.  It is now 30 minutes late and I am pretty sure that burger is coming back up shortly. When I sensed that \"just a little off\" taste I  should have refused to eat it.  The waiters took the fries basket and the tea off the bill so she was trying. Mixing  up Coke with Sprite and then ignoring us was a mistake that got noticed in the tip.",

I feel bad not putting a review the last few times that I've been here, those should all be nothing but good reviews. This last time unfortunately was the worst ever. I'm thinking it may be because the employees were new but the owner I'm sure as hell would like to know how some of his employees work while he's not around. Been here so many times with the family but this time around we just weren't treated the same. I ordered wings was charged full price during happy hour and received 8 weeks. I asked when they change that, the waitress didn't say nothing and said I'll be right back. Long story short, came back and said I have two more Wings on the way. My son asked for a refill and the waitress said okay honey hang on just a second I will be right back. And she forgot. My son got his drink about 12 minutes later. I got my wings, two wings 10 minutes later. The way they apologized was not accepted wasn't even a real apology. They brought the two wings and said enjoy your wings. I asked for the tab and I, basically excluded the charge for the wings and only paid for wut we ate and drank. I forgot to exclude the extra Ranch that I ordered LOL. Anyway, we won't be back during the week. Horrible feeling after going thru all that and my son asking about his drink.",

Our orders were almost completely wrong with one 1 of the 6 being correct. We had to ask for silverware as well as glasses of water. In addition to the incorrect food, the waitress did not check to see how the food came out. After our meal, we asked to speak to the manager and had to continue to wait. After explaining the experience to the manager, he was useless and did nothing for the poor service that was provided.   Super disappointing since we used to love coming here for happy hour and now the service is horrible.",

Zipps is supposed to be that neighborhood spot that's not trashy, but not fancy either. I have mad faith in this spot because it's been pretty good to me. However, like a relationship, the bs starts to get old. Does Zipps not have a standard recipe for all dishes? I mean, it's very common to order something and have it presented differently almost every time. Let's not include the basic appetizers (which come out f'd up too sometimes). I'm more so talking about: salads-from the different mixed greens, to presentation, to burgers, the list goes on There is no standardized process or expectation. Is everyone back there free styling making \"their\" version of what Zipps food and menu should be? Or did I not get the memo? People want consistency!!! You raised your prices- now raise your standards.  Dissatisfied person- 32-36th St Indianschool location",

We ordered two orders of buffalo wings one beer and one order of fries. We were waiting about 10 minutes to receive the beer and had to walk up to the bartender to ask them to have it brought out. We got the wings no problem. We still had not gotten our fries half way through the wings. We kept trying to hunt down the waitress but she never came back to check on us once. I finally had to get up and find a random server to ask about  our fries which were clearly forgotten then a third waiter brought them out to us not even our waitress and the fries were cold. Really poor form on the waitresses part for disappearing. A very simple order that was completely botched up I will not be coming back",

    "text": "Zipp's Arcadia was one of my favorite local \"go to\" sports bars in the neighborhood. Anyone that knows Arcadia, knows, there are some other pretty cool spots, but I always appreciate the personable service I get from the bartenders and barmaids. Anna and Rachel are a couple of my favorites! They are both great at what they do and make it cool and fun. Frankly, they rock!   The food is pretty good, but the level of service is what had me coming back. You also get to know a few of the neighborhood regulars and feel like a neighborhood family, hanging out to watch a good game. Thank you to those that have made it enjoyable, up until today!! I appreciate you! Cheers to you!   My complaint is with the Manger, Kevin! The bar was empty, which I could see is his biggest concern. The place was not packed by any means and no one was standing up waiting to get a seat. There were empty tables behind me. I came in crutches today to watch the SEA vs ARI game and he insisted, that I remove my post surgery boot, off the chair next to me, so that the seat would be available to someone else. There was no one else. I attempted to tell him, if the seat was needed, I would gladly put my foot down, if someone needed to sit down. Regardless, of logic and good manners, he insisted I put my foot down. So, I gracefully put it down, watched a great win and paid my bill. I doubled my tip, just so that I wouldn't take away from the level of service and commitment that Anna offers. I wanted to make that clear, despite his lack of leadership and consideration.   However, I will not be going back, ever! (YES, I WILL BE PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN, Kevin!) I hv lived in the Arcadia neighborhood for years and appreciate a good local bar, but Kevin made Zipp's the opposite of what I thought Arcadia was known for and took pride in.   Kevin, find another job! You are not good at what you do and after sharing my disappointment with other patrons and staff, I am not alone in my opinion. For all those that can't or don't say it - You suck at your job! My suggestion is to go back to school and learn some management skills or supersize my fries.",

This was the driest, most disgusting meat I have encountered in my LIFE!  My friend thought they accidentally gave me beef!  (There is a choice between mix 'n' match beef and/or chicken.)  I actually thought she was right until I could kind of tell the difference.....  This is a dry, goopy mess with no salt, no taste, no moisture.  The \"soft corn\" tortillas fell apart IMMEDIATELY upon order and I was around the corner after picking up.  Zipps all over town have been awesome - I DO NOT say this about all.  But something about his 36th St. and Indian School location (called chefs, service, QUALITY CONTROL, MANAGEMENT, and more) is seriously troubling.  Love all other locations.  If this is in fact a chain, this particular restaurant is highly misrepresenting quality and brand equity....",

    "text": "So I just got off the phone with Tiffany at their corporate offices and I am sorry to say that she was not willing to address the public humiliation that we endured at this location. They stand by their employees and apparently think it's okay for them to disrespect people in this manner. I called with the intention of addressing the matter of public humiliation and how Jared spoke to us and I kept getting the response that they provided a convenience to us for providing separate checks. So basically, telling people that they are immoral and irresponsible are part of their employee training program.  She also continued to state that my friends and I are \"attacking\" them on social media. Wow, doesn't feel too great. Her \"apology\" was \"I am sorry for your frustration, but we stand by their employees.\"  I am absolutely beside myself with this company and how they have reused to have their employee apologize for his behavior. So when you visit this location, please keep track of what you ordered, how you pay, and when they pick up your payment. It's clearly your responsibility to make sure they are doing their job. Oh, and if you're in the mood for a loud verbal attack with a side of humiliation and a splash of racism, please go here now!   If I could give a negative zero, I would! We just left this establishment and are mortified! We went to celebrate my brother in laws birthday and there were some people there that we didn't know. Some people ordered shots, my husband and I and another couple did not order shots! Well, most of the group left and we were the 4 that stayed. Jared, who I think needs to glorify his ego every now and then basically harassed us into paying the bill for 3 shots that people (who we didn't know) didn't pay for. He referred to us as irresponsible customers. When we asked for our bill, he tacked on the 3 shots we did not order. We told him we would pay for the food and drinks that WE ordered and he told us we had to. Jared spent taxpayers' money by calling the police. We happily paid our bill for the food and drinks we orderedh, (which is a solution we offered to Jared) and the police had to mediate because I'm sure they have nothing else to do on a Saturday night. So now, for paying for what we ordered. We are now considered trespassers at Zipp's. Jared, much luck to you in life. I truly hope that your career at Zipp's flourishes. #dreambigJared",

Everything ran smoothly until the checks arrived and we noticed 3 additional shots that we did not order and when we tried to rectify the situation and have them removed from the bill the so called manager by the name of \"Jared\" or \"Garrett\" refused to take them off because individuals who were in the group (that had left at least twenty minutes prior) had left them unpaid. He informed us that we would now be responsible for paying for their error and lack of organization. Keep in mind the waitress broke down separate checks and the group had paid their tabs with no trouble or issues. We asked for our check and he proceeded to add the unpaid shots to our tab which led to a humiliating ordeal as he called the cops (great use of our taxpayer dollars) because we refused to pay for something we didn't order. Great customer service! The sad thing is I've been going to this location for 5+ years and never had an issue. It's amazing how the management has deteriorated and become incompetent. Lesson to be learned is if you refuse to pay for something you DID NOT order you will get 86'd. Save yourself the heartache and go somewhere else.",

They have enough tv's in the place that you can watch every game without being taken over by them.  Golden wings are great.  Monaco Foccacia is my personal favorite. Kids always enjoy their dinner with mom and dad, maybe because of the chocolate chip cookie skillet with ice cream.  Good food, great service, perfect prices.",

I've only been to the locations in Scottsdale but decided to try the new one on Indian School after work for the Suns game. It was packed for the game and luckily we got a table on the patio. We had decent service probably would have been better if the Suns weren't in the playoffs. They had a good happy hour with cheap beer and apps. I had the chicken quisadillas they were spicy and delicious. The only thing that would have made it better was if the suns had won.",

Ivory Coast, I stumbled into Zipps on Indian School.   First, a little disclosure. I own 3 gold mines in Ivory Coast, so I am biased. Second, I am glad I am not at the game, because from the consistent buzzing noise, there must be a swarm of locust hovering around the stadium.   Bottom Line: Best Burgers in town, hottest athletic looking waitresses, cold beer and knowledgeable sports fans watching dozens of High Def TVs. Only drawback, not a lot of sympathetic Ivory Coast Fans.",

After waiting for 15 minutes we finally saw the waitress again so I could ask about them, at which point she brought them right out with an excuse about being slammed. There were only a few other tables occupied. At least the chips were pretty good. I think the salsa was Pace.   The grilled chicken sandwich was nothing special. The chicken was thin and dry. The onion was sliced way too thick so it was a bit over powering.   My wife tried the pizza, which was equally unimpressive. It seemed equivalent to cheap frozen pizza. My two year old wouldn't even eat it.   The french fries were devoid of taste and needed some seasoning. Perhaps they could have sprinkled them with some Viagra, because they were also rather limp.  The only good thing was the price. You get what you pay for.",

The place was busy, as it was the lunch hour and it looked like the TV section at Best Buy.   I asked our server if she wouldn't mind having our orders on separate checks.   Her response: \"I'm not obligated to do it so if I have time, I'll do it.\"  What I wanted to say to her: \"Bitch, please!\"  I ordered a Chicken Focaccia and when I got my order, it was a wrap. Since all my coworkers started eating and she was no where in sight, I just ate it. When she came around, I asked her if this was supposed to be a sandwich:  Her response: Well, this is our version of focaccia. The wrap is like a thin pita bread quesadilla thing. Its not focaccia. Its our version. I thought you knew because you come here all the time. Well... do you like it?  Firstly, this was my first time but I must look like I eat here all the time.  What I wanted to say to her: \"Bitch, please!\"  The wrap was basically chicken chunks, mayonnaise and a pita bread quesadilla thing. Whatever that means. It was gross.   If I wasn't there with a bunch of other people, I probably would have sent it back but we were all on our lunch break together. For my first visit, you get one star for poor service and not knowing what focaccia is.",

Zipps always has great service and good drink specials.  Good place to be even when it was 110 degrees in there for the ASU-Georgia game earlier this year.  Food is always good with a great selection.  Go here, try to avoid the place across the street.  Addendum for Fred M: Phoenix is not a basketball city.  Phoenix has never been a basketball city.  Phoenix is not a sports city.  Phoenix sports fans have never been fans of anything.  Finally, paid shuffleboard is an ugly reality now.  It is more and more difficult to find bars without the paid shuffleboard.  Unfortunately, it seems that many places want to fleece us for some more money on top of the cold ones we paid for during play.  I love shuffleboard and I think that everyone should have a table in their home.",

Quick and easy to get from the bartender. We sit and sip our beers and another ten minutes later the waitress stops by to see if we want any food. We say yes we are ready to order and she goes to drop off some dishes and makes no rush to return. We finally order some simple chicken skewers and wait, and wait, and wait... 38 min exactly and after watching several other food orders come out and the cooks visibly not making anything in the kitchen, we finally walk out. Never coming here again. Service is appalling!!!",

Not only did they allow young kids to run around and yell across the (pretty empty) dining room. My son's chicken wings took an extremely long time to be made and then they came out dry... NO SAUCE at all. We had to send them back for sauce (he ordered the hottest and they usually come saucy). Our waitress only had a few tables and though she seemed friendly was not very attentive.  Best part about tonight... the Zipparita.  Sorry ZIPPS... you have a ton of new competition in the area and you are failing to keep up.",

    "text": "I've been to a few other Zipp's in the valley, from Peoria to Scottsdale. Each has a different personality. I prefer the Indian School location because of the historic charm of the older building which this Zipp's occupies. And I've been to this location before, for lunch with my \"foodie\" co-workers.  Zipp's shares a lot with your typical sports bar with lots of televisions. Big televisions! But the exposed barrel vault wooden trusses and red brick make it feel more welcoming. It's like the difference between watching a baseball game at a stadium built in the 70's vs watching one at the friendly confines of Wrigley Field.  There are a lot of options on the menu which you might expect from a sports bar. And then there are some that are a step above. There are plenty of salad options and healthier choices as well. I have yet to try a pizza yet, but my co-workers can attest to their goodness.  The burger options are pretty unique too. During this visit, I enjoyed a green chile burger with pepper jack cheese and a small side of chili. It wasn't pretty, but it was an excellent combination of flavors! I only regret not trying the home made sweet potato chips.  Other Zipp's locations are flashier and newer. Which is fine. I prefer a little more character in a sports bar. Due to this being a lunch time visit, I neglected to pay attention to the beer menu. But as I recall from my Peoria visit, there was a solid selection of beers available on draft.  And if you've ever tried the infamous Cheesy Burger, it is not on the menu, but it's still available by request!",

Not the best I've had, but pretty good as far as a sports bar is concerned.  As regulars during the football season, we typically try to get there early. They won't sit you at the big tables until your whole group is there. This can be frustrating when you're waiting for one person, but you have to be sitting in a corner with a bad view of your game.  Overall, Zipps is what you expect from a sports bar.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying the service was exceptional.  Our server made sure we had plenty of beer and checked back frequently.  That was the high point of our meal.  Next, we had the wings, regular, hot.  Others have raved about these wings and I would have to say that for bar food, they were not bad.  The wings were meaty and slathered nicely with a hot sauce that was actually hot.  Unfortunately, however, it went downhill from here.  Everybody at the table had a salad, Buffalo Chicken, the chop salad, and I had the Taco Salad with Ground Beef.  My salad was described as having fresh jalapenos and salsa.  It probably would have brought some life to a sad, uninspiring salad if those two ingredients had actually attended.  It had high hopes, but failed miserably at delivering anything that would have a spark.  The lettuce was put in the bowl wet, which left a pool of water at the bottom, after being tossed in my (requested) blue cheese dressing.  The dressing just kinda combined with the water to make a watery, limp mess of the lettuce.  The ground beef did not taste fresh, nor did it really taste of much anything.  The cheddar cheese was buried somewhere in the lettuce.  My companions had similar comments about their salads.  It is too bad, as it looked like they were trying, sort of, to meet the menu description halfway.  Too bad, as it really sounds good from the menu.  A decent selection of beers, both domestic and foreign, with a couple of mass-marketed micro-brews for diversity.   The bar itself is mostly dining room with tables and some booths, and I did see a nice patio with a firepit and televisions, but it was too cold for us to sit out there, a decision apparently everybody else made.  I was also informed that it was a smoking patio.  Oh well.  There were big screen TV's mounted everywhere and they all had the same game playing (Rose Bowl), so you could only miss a play if you blinked.  There is one lonely pool table that sat unused for the time we were there, and a couple of golfing video games which seemed just a bit more popular.  A shuffleboard table went unused as well.  Prices are a bit on the high end, considering the product that was delivered, and while they brag something about \"no $12 burgers\", I suspect that even paying $9 might be a bit extravagant.",

The issue was the utter lack of hospitality, service, and management that I've grown to appreciate in the Bethany Home location. Most definitely will not be returning to this poorly run and highly questionable Zipps establishment.  Also, the wifi legit does not work. Log on, 30 seconds later you are logged off. Don't come here with the iPad for fantasy football. Once again, just go to 16th and Bethany. This place is a disgrace to the Zipps name.",

It took about 15 minutes to have our order even taken when it was empty to begin with. We ordered wings fries and side salads. Which by the way is DELISH and I could honestly take shots of wing sauce and ranch for funzies. I order the same thing every time! however when my order came no fries were delivered I told the person that brought it we ordered fries so she went and approached Liz -- right away Liz came over and told us we didn't order fries I said yes we did but don't worry about it and she walked away. I was telling my friend we did order fries and from across the room Liz yelled you did not order fries. I quickly ate a chicken wing so I didn't tell her how I really felt. To say the least who screams across the restaurant?! I know what I ordered! RUDE and never again will I be back to that location. Liz take some customer service courses you might get a few more 20%tips. PS because I don't want to focus on Liz I do want to mention that Ashley that brought us our bill was extremely friendly and wish I had gotten her from the jump.

Unless you enjoy eating carelessly prepared food, being lied to, being overcharged for things that are supposed to be on happy hour or have items added on your bill (in the hope you won't notice), don't go here. Since this place opened up,  I have been probably a dozen times.  Each time I have been it is one ridiculous thing after the other.  One time I ordered a buffalo focaccia and it came with no sauce! It was plain chicken wrapped in  damn bread...so of course the server told me they served the sauce on the side now...my husband ordered the same thing on the next visit and it came with the sauce in the wrap! And figuring out their happy hour makes you just want to grab a 6 pack and head home and even if you understand between what hours to order what you have to correct them because it is NEVER right. This weekend was the last time I will ever step foot in this piece of sh* place.  My husband asked the server if Alaskan Amber was on special,  she said yes and when the bill arrived SURPRISE! We were charged full price.  She then gave us some BS about it being super premium which wasn't on special.  The manager offered to buy him a beer NEXT time...no voucher to prove he offered it...because of course he can be trusted! So no, I do not recommend this place. Yelp should allow you to give negative stars...",

    "text": "We went to Zipps to watch college football. The Kansas State alumni club was taking up much of the restaurant with the KSU/OU game on the tv's. The service was very good as the waitresses kept up with everone. The food is conventional bar food with a limited beer selection. Prices weren't cheap but given than we camped at the table for three hours, it was fine. Probably a 3 star sports bar experience.  So I rate my Zipps experience 4 stars because of the entertainment value provided by the table next to us. It had about six of the most annoying teenage boys I've seen since my daughter's 8th grade advancement ceremony. Now, granted, I came from a generation where you bent the bill of your baseball cap and hid your smile if you were 15 and rocking braces but I'm no square. I get that teenager boys are constantly trying to figure out the society around them so I cut them slack for dressing like retards, growing too slow, and being annoying - in fact, I even pump up my Zipps Yelp review because no one responded when, for example, the table of virgins cheered when OU scored in an attempt to rile up the KSU alums. And to watch them putting away ranch like it's nobody's business while commenting on who should ask out the waitress (she was probably too hot for me, but why wouldn't Angus have a shot at this 32 year old POA? What with his off-color Red Sox cap and sweatshirt from the Jesse Pinkman season one collection, who could say no?). From watching them systematically remove any traces of vegetables from their Cheapest-Thing-On-The-Menu-Burgers to discussing the merits and shortcomings of the domestic swills (Ham claimed a liking for dark microbrews -- but then failed to make a \"just like I like my women\" joke) to stumbling through dividing the check with proper tip, the fact that Zipps leaves these wieners alone and treats them like a regular group of awkward grown men will assure their (and my) repeat business as a new generation of ASU-educated 49ers fans are bred right before my eyes.",

Which means I will never again risk death on the I-17 as I race home from work praying that I get to the Vig before 5:55 so I have enough time to order a drink and some hummus before prices go back up at 6:00. Instead, I will leisurely cruise on down to Zipps. Maybe I'll even stop at home first to change, something I would never even DREAM of when Vig was involved.  Zipp's freed me from the hell that is 4-6 Mon-Fri happy hour.  The $3 margaritas taste very much like the $6 Z Tejas 6th Street Margaritas. There's a limit of 3. I'm not sure if that's for cost control or safety liability, but 3 is enough to knock me on my ass, so I won't complain. The Golden Hot wings are amazing, and surprisingly hot. I would start with Golden Medium and then get a side of Hot if you think you can handle at. FYI: It makes people perspire.  I've yet to have an actual meal here, just apps and drinks, but the menu items look tasty (I'm especially looking forward to trying the Sweet Jalapeno Burger) and if the execution is on par with the mouthgasm that is the wings, I'm sure I'll be satisfied.",

It is an outrage that you dared to open this in August/September, knew there was an a/c problem (as evidenced by the comments of your staff when some in our party complained), and have still done nothing about it as of late September. Absolutely infuriating to walk into a place on a 100-degree night only to find it feeling like 105 inside. I should've listened to the game on the radio in my car. When the waitress asked if there was anything else she could get for us, I almost said \"Yeah, a shower.\"",

Very attentive, friendly waitress. The manager checked back several times, refilling beverages and striking up conversation--all very friendly and welcoming. Drinks were always full and I never had to ask for anything--very impressive, especially for a sports bar.   Unfortunately the food is good, but not great. I ordered a slice of happy hour pizza ($1.50 plus .50 each additional topping) which was quite good and I'm a pizza snob. I highly recommend the shrimp skewers off the appetizer menu--delicious! But they come on a bed of way-too-greasy and overfried onion rings. The fish and chips were also very greasy, with thin, unsatisfying fries. I guess this is what one should expect at a sports bar, but I'm a dreamer who keeps hoping that someone will get inspired and offer the best of both worlds.",

I live out of town and was not able to be there for his party, so I thought perhaps I'd have cupcakes sent.  They let me know that they don't usually let in outside food and drink, but that they were happy to make an exception.  In fact, they called me several times to follow up and make sure that they had all of the details down so that the treats got to the right birthday boy.  Mark and Chris were awesome and totally went above and beyond.    From what I hear the food is pretty fabulous there, too.  And I can assure you you'll get awesome service from their wonderful staff.",

    "text": "Wings, Beers, Burgers, Football - Sunday Funday never tasted or sounded so good!  Zipps knows it - Zipps as a restaurant/bar knows how to appeal to its customers.  Unfortunately I was unimpressed by this particular location.  Nestled in a strip mall across from another sports bar, Hazelwoods, I just didn't get a good vibe from this place.  Although relatively new, everything seemed old.  The lighting was dim, and the atmosphere was dark.  It felt like it needed a remodel.   I am a big fan of both North Scottsdale Zipps locations so maybe I'm just spoiled, but I don't think I will be returning to Arcadia.  It does keep to the standard Zipps format - Flat screen TV's all around, drink and food specials throughout the day.  But like all of the locations - it gets crowded and sometimes the layout isn't the best - especially when you're trying to watch a particular team.    The food here was good - but it's always good.  Standard sports bar food - wings, burgers, fries, with hearty portions.  Beer selection is nothing special - mainly domestics and no IPA's (which in actuality is probably better on Sunday football days so you last through all of the games!)  I do enjoy their bloody mary's.  Service is as prompt as it can be with as crowded as it gets.  All in all, everything you want and expect a Zipps to be - just in a subpar location.",

The golden wings are so bomb dot com that we visited Zipps 3 times in one weekend when our friends were in town. They loved them just as much as we do. Plus, it's a great place to hang out and grab some drinks. Throw some shuffleboard in there and you're good to go. The night we went to this particular location we had great service and she was pleasant throughout despite our table growing in size with each new friend that arrived.

Chances are if you're a fan of great sports bars you've been to one of their other locations, but this new location on Indian School is one to go out of the way for.  After entering, I first noticed that they did some great remodeling, knocking down all the walls and really opening the place up to show off the almost infinite amount of flat panel hi-def tv's. The hosts were comically over-inviting, and I'm pretty sure I heard 5 or 6 enthusiastic \"HELLO!\"'s, but that's the least of my worries when I enter an establishment. After being led to the booth (yes they were PACKED, but there's booths lining every wall) It must've taken 30 minutes to read through all the specials, and I believe there's only ONE HOUR THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WHEN THERE ARE NO SPECIALS!   We ended up ordering better than average chips and fresh guac and the best wings (golden) I'd had in a while, and that's when I saw it... Four massive flat panel hi-def tv's set on TRANSFORMING ROBOTIC ARMS THAT PERIODICALLY SHIFT THEM FROM ONE MASSIVE TV STRUCTURE (showing one channel) TO FOUR SEPARATE TV's (with four different channels)!! I don't know who thought of that, or if it was an original idea, but it was a really cool touch.   Our servers were so nice and attentive, the food was fresh and generously portioned, and the overall experience was perfect.  It was great to get the same great things I had expected from Zipps...",

    "text": "Friends, Coworkers, and acquaintances have been hyping up Zipps to me for years. The wings, the burgers, the shuffleboard, the tv's, and well just about everything about the place has been hyped to the point that I was dying to go there when I found out they opened one across the street from my favorite sports bar, Hazelwoods.   The beginning of our visit didn't start out so well, when we asked for sound on the Suns game and heard the response \"we only do sound for big games or if people request it.\" Firstly, it's a big game anytime the home team is playing. Maybe you're new to Phoenix, Mr. Manager of a Sports Bar, but you need to figure out that Phoenix has always been a basketball city. Also, the sound has been requested, we are requesting it, and I was told when I called at 4:30 PM  that sound on the game would be no problem. I told the manager about my previous phone call and he didn't seem to care. 15 minutes later he came by and said \"ok, some people requested sound so we are going to turn it on.\" damn, was it that hard?  Food came, and I ordered the golden medium wings I'd heard so much about. Hmm, these wings were neither meaty, crispy, or quality. They sure were tasty, but the quality was not there. I had the Wednesday special of four chicken tacos, and they were also of low quality. I know this is a sports bar and I don't expect tremendous cuisine, but c'mon, don't insult me with this garbage. I'd have been better suited eating chicken mcnuggets from McDonald's. I was in for $40 having three beers, tacos, and wings. I couldn't have been more unimpressed. I've spent half the money at Hazelwoods and Native New Yorker and been twice as happy.  Now this was a kicker that may not be big to anyone but I thought it was pathetic. Their shuffleboard table has bars on it that prohibit anyone from playing unless you put money in it. I've NEVER seen a bar which doesn't allow you to play complimentary or even just hold your keys like Pomeroy's or 16th Street Sports Bar. Ridiculous. Lame. Awful. Also, their TV setup was not what I expected. I don't think there was anything bigger than about 50\" and with how high on the walls they were, they were kind of difficult to see from certain places.  No sir, I don't like it.",

This Zipps is fluid, well run, inviting, and the servers were ALL friendly to my friends and I during happy hour.  The drinks are delicious and the food is well prepared.    For a sports bar...fantastic.  For dinner, fantastic.  For lunch when I only have 30 minutes and I ask the bartender if she wouldn't mind asking for a rush....amazing.

She said \"Ok, I will be back in a minute to take your order.\"  It would have helped to have a menu to look at while she was gone.  She came aback and asked what I wanted.  Hmm. What would you say?  I asked for a menu.  I ordered a soda which she put in a to-go cup. Awesome!  Wish she would have refilled it while I was waiting.  I left when they gave me my bag of food.  When I got back to work, which is 3 minutes away,  I opened the box to find brown cold fries and a dry as could be chicken sandwhich.  I doubt I'll order from here again.",

I've been to multiple Zipps before across Arizona and have never been as impressed as I am today. Our server is just fantastic, super cheery and outgoing, as every server should be. Every person that has walked by is cheery and obviously happy to be here/working here and I just can't get over the all over fantastic vibe of this place. I worked in the industry for five years and know the difference between a team that flows and works well together/gets along and let me tell you this place is one of those places! So impressed!!! Thank you to everyone at this location",

When we asked the waitress to reconcile the difference, she told us that they would not honor the originally quoted $6 price for the beers.  The manager on duty's name was Gary. Gary didn't even have the decency to come to our table and apologize for the misunderstanding or offer to discount our bill.

Less than 5 minutes, she brings another basket back.  I tried a french fry and it was lukewarm and soggy.  I got the server's attention and told her the fries were not hot and they were soggy.  She took them back.  Bobby, the manager, came over and told us that they are taking the fries off our bill as the fries can not meet our standards. We told him they were not hot and they were soggy. He said he had already made two baskets of fries and did not want to make a third.   He did not make us a new 2nd basket as there was not enough time between the server taking the first basket and the arrival of the second basket.   That was it.  No apologies and no offer to get us anything else.  We were left there with no fries and onion rings.  Unbelievable!!!  Extremely poor customer service.  I won't go back there!",

The specials change every day, but they often have $5 wings (Golden Medium are the best in town), $3 zipparitas, and $4 32oz beers. The service is always friendly and casual.

I've enjoyed most of the focaccias I've tried but typically get the chicken with an extra side of the garlic mayo. Burgers are good. Wings are good. Fries and onion rings are great. And love the cookie skillet.  So I was quite surprised yesterday when we found ourselves with some time to kill nearby and our Zipp's Arcadia experience was completely underwhelming.  Beer was still cold but the chicken focaccia was flavorless, as seemed even the garlic mayo??? And the fries and onion rings were limp lukewarm. It even seemed that the beer batter was way off with a chalky touch.   While I don't have high expectations for Zipp's, nothing crazy, I was still completely let down. Though I expect to spend a great deal of time this coming year right next door, I will take the extra time to choose and travel to a better nearby spot. I'm sure I'll give this location another chance in the future but not for a good while. Disappointed.",

It was a monday night, so the wings were on special as well as 32oz domestic drafts, which was music to my ears bc i'm a huge fan of wings! Not domestics though... My fiance ordered a burger which looked really good... but I'm here to talk about the wings! I ordered the Extra Hot because I think I'm a badass with an iron stomach. The waitress warned me that they were stupid hot, so I opted with just Hot... they were also stupid hot... I can handle my hot sauce but this was straight habanero! Good flavor though! Now any time I go I just order the Medium with the hot sauce on the side for LIGHT dipping.  Like I said before, this bar is just very cozy. The patio especially! The armchairs surrounding the fire pit are comfortable enough to fall asleep in. There are flatscreens everywhere (this is a sports bar after all)!   The bartenders and servers are all SUPER friendly, and I'm pretty sure the one who warned me against the Extra Hot wings probably saved my life by changing my mind! Thanks Zipps!!",

Our orders were generally wrong if we were lucky enough to get our orders at all. Half of us had to order multiple times before the servers even got the order into the kitchen.

She claims it is because of Zipps management, however, this is a stupid response. I have never heard of an establishment that won't split checks for a party. This sever also took about 20 minutes to bring waters and confuses cokes with coffee. She also brought out drinks we never ordered but of course, have to pay for. She also checked our IDs, naturally, but if she was truly paying attention, she would know it was someone's birthday at the table and would have mentioned something. Her complete lack of common sense lead us to question our happy hour locations.",

    "text": "Sort all these comments by date and read them.  To put it simply, ownership does not care.  They're making money hand over fist at other locations and have let this place slide into a crevice deep into the earth.  If they gave a damn about the customer, and customer service in general, these comments would stop flowing.  This could be \"the\" sports bar to go in Arcadia with minimal effort.  As a (former) long time regular, most of the comments you read here are spot on and the norm these days.  Slowly but surely they're losing the core of their business, their regular customers.  Goldman Group:  The authors of these comments aren't bitter former employees with a grudge.  These were your loyal customers.  Start listening.  They're doing you a favor by giving you feedback.  PROS * A history of solid staff behind the bar for the most part. * Outstanding technology (I.e. number of TV screens, screen placement, etc.). * NFL Sunday Ticket and individual TV's labeled with what game will be shown on that screen. * Beers specials and beer portion size. * Decent, but shrinking, group of regular customers.  CONS * High floor staff turnover. * Store Management does not know sports.  Setting the TV's for current and appropriate sports content should be a basic fundamental, ya know, for a \"sports bar.\"  Game sound for appropriate games should trump their weak Muzak selection.  Katy Perry anyone? * Food quality has consistently declined over time.  Forget about ordering their specialty, wings, well done or crispy.  They won't be cooked to order.  ALWAYS check your to-go order before you leave the bar.  It's often wrong. * Bathrooms are not well kept. * Nickle and dimed for extra anything. * Seat comfort at the bar high top tables. * Management.  The decent managers have been transferred to other stores or have apparently left for greener pastures. Current store management doesn't have a common sense clue about service.  In a nutshell Zipps Ownership, customers want a reason to come to this location.  They really do.  It's conveniently located and could be a sports bar with a great vibe.  We've given you chance after chance and you consistently fail and disappoint.  If you're not going to listen and improve, close the place down and let someone take the space who knows what they are doing and gives a damn.",

    "text": "I like to take ownership of the bar I go to. I like to feel as though when I walk in, I am at home with a bunch of friends. Rarely do I feel out of place after a couple visits somewhere.........I unfortunately feel that way at Zipps from time to time. I will cover that in a bit..  ~Fud/Drink~ The food is OK. I expect a bar these days to have better food if you are paying the prices they put on the menu. As much as people knocked my old bar that closed, Antars, the food there was amazing, and there are many other spots with better food options than just burgers. Here, its generic bar food. The salads are all iceberg lettuce with some generic romaine thrown in. I can go to a bowling alley and eat the same quality of food. The sandwiches taste good but aren't made with quality add-ins. Prices are still high, and I have to be careful or I'll be spending too much. There aren't many high incentive deals for me on Sundays for specials, most of them are during the week. Oh well.    ~Atmosphere/Service~ Jumping to the level of service, let me give you an example of what I recently ran into: I had to go outside during that recent cold spell we had in early January 2013.  It was close to 25 out, I had my Jersey on expecting to sit somewhere inside but, due to their expected large rush of customers and the bar being filled, they awkwardly advised me they couldn't let me sit at a table normally for two...Even after I insisted I could wait until a seat opens up at the bar. Instead they had to have me go outside. I didn't bring my coat in, because I was expecting to show off the jersey...that's why you bought it in the first place, lol... Now, given this scenario, I will point out the heaters were on, but its just too damn cold. Personally I think that's just poor service. I was still pretty cold, and the chairs outside are not as comfortable when its 25 out once again.  ~Extras/Rating~ Everything said, this place is a popular spot and I had to see it for myself. It may be a good spot to hang out with the guys, given some beer specials for parties of two or more. I usually fly solo on football Sundays. Not many Ravens fans out in the valley ... that'll do it too. I do not knock this place, 3 stars for being a round-about average bar with average food and service. Its a bit generic, but will fill the need for a sports bar if you are in the general area. I would recommend it to others looking to go out for a generic bar atmosphere in the area. I have to mention that Arcadia Tavern, which is right down the street, is in my eyes a much bigger improvement over this Zipps.",

But my decision is finally made. The ambiance is nice.  Much more upscale/trendy than tried and True but tired Hazelwoods across the street.  The food is adequate/OK/good/tasty--but is basically re-invented bar food. The food prices are,  IMHO, about $1 more per item than they should be for the quality that you get. $9 burgers.  $8 wings  The patio looks cozy and inviting and I'll bet I would be very happyout there if I could just bully my companions into sitting outside for a change  I've tried to sit outside every time I've gone and every time, I get outvoted.  :(  Oh well, it probably reeks of smokers anyway I guess.  :/  Happy Hour prices are just so-so. This is not an expensive bar, but it is not a particularly cheap bar either-you can tell what kind of liquor licence they hold by the high cost of alcohol and the relatively inexpensive food. All in all, it would have been a solid 4 star review--except for two things.  One minor issue and one MAJOR issue. Minor one first.  I find the tables and chairs uncomfortable.  The pub height AND the regular ones.  The major one is a short story. 5 of us, Happy Hour, watching a game, ordering food and masses of beverages.    The waitress comes by to check and see if we want to order anything before Happy Hour ends.   We start discussing beers with her and she talks us into a premium beer by pointing out that we save 4 dollars a pitcher during HH.  So we order 2--and some more food. When it came time to leave, we noticed that the premium beers and all of the food ordered when she came to check on us (remember she was taking orders before HH ended?) ALL FULL PRICE. An extra $22.00. When we pointed it out, she couldn't have cared less.  Simply shrugged and said the computer decides the prices based on the time the order is entered. Wasn't she the one that wasted  time talking us into the premium pitchers?  You bet!  That dropped this down from a solid 4 to a shaky 3.",

    "text": "This was such an odd experience! I usually go to the Zipps on 16th St. and Bethany and have always had a great time. We went to the Indian School location on a Monday (Memorial Day) for lunch and drinks. It was dead - I am pretty sure our server had two tables. The initial greeting when we sat was quick and careless. I didn't really think twice about it, maybe she was having a bad day or frustrated because it was dead. I completely get that servers have bad days too.   My friend and I hadn't seen each other in about six months so we were slow to order. We were enjoying our conversation and drinks (which I completely recommend - the frozen margarita with the strawberry puree). If it were slammed I would have picked up the pace a bit but there was a total of about ten people in the entire place. The service got increasingly short and rushed as if we did something to offend the server.   As I think back on it I know we did not ask for anything out of the ordinary and we were not being obnoxious so I am still confused. We started with wings - which were great (per usual). We then ordered a couple of sandwiches. The server would not even look at us as time went on. We ordered a couple sandwiches and my friend requested an extra side of ranch. The guy who delivered it (I am assuming was the manager on duty) did not say a word to us or look at us. I was sure to say \"thank you\" and I got no response. The sandwiches were nothing to write home about although at the other location I have had delicious ones. We ended up just asking for the check because of the situation. When she would come to ask if we needed anything she did not stop at the table it was like \"need anything\" as she was walking by.   It became almost awkward because I was so confused by the service or the lack of. I am even finding it hard to explain why it was such a negative experience. It takes a lot for me not to tip at least 20% and in this case I ended up tipping around 10% because of the situation.   On top of it I was running in to the house to puke when I arrived home. So I guess this experience was also my first case of food poisoning. After about 6 hours of puking, sweating, and napping I was still rethinking what we could have done to offend the server.   OH I did ask to turn down the music a tiny bit because Brittany Spears was blaring! Maybe that is why....if so - I am sorry, I didn't mean to ask something so out of line.",

In addition, lots of TVs so every seat and table has a good view of several different games playing.  But as everyone knows, it's how they run the restaurant that makes it or breaks it.  This is where they fall down. I came in for Monday Night Football and they ran the Suns game through the central speakers instead if the game.    Asked the manager how come... His answer, \"because that was what was first requested\".  So I asked, \"whoever comes in first, sits down gets to decide what gets pumped through the speakers\"? He said yes.  Unbelievable! I sure hope nobody comes in early on Sunday and requests figure skating.  90% of everyone at Zipps was there for Monday Night Football but, instead, we listened to the Suns game.  Management needs to be changed!  I'm heading across the street to Hazzelwoods next week... I bet they'll know what to play on Monday Night!",

I know I will not revisit any Zipps in town this was my third location and again it was a fail. Lesson learned. Note the food was tasteless and after waiting I did not want my meal anymore",

With pucks and sticks, he likes yummy wings, and the facaccia  ( yes, I know it is spelled wrong ) buffalo wrap with extra chicken for only $2 plus a side of wing sauce.  He loves the fries which always come HOT and OILY, and I love the salad with their yummy blue cheese dressing with extra chunks of cheese on top.  The service is good and they remember us there.  We like the ZIPPS in Tempe outside seating for a change of pace.    ENJOY !",

    "text": "I hate the my star rating on this Zipps keep falling, but it does. Each time we have stopped in the last few months things have taken a serious down turn.   Myself and my husband and his friend stopped in for a last min dinner a few weeks ago. Starving! we ordered some wings right away. It was still happy hour thankfully so we splurged and got two orders to share. They took forever it seemed like, and yes I know that fried wings take longer to make, but this was like 35 min, too long. The waitress didn't seem to eager to return to the table very often, our drinks went very empty for awhile. If you know anything about their soda and water glasses you know it is hard to consume them entirely, they are huge, but we did. She finally came back to take our order and it didn't seem to translate to the computer very well. All of our orders came out wrong. No sauce or veggies on my sandwich, fries that were clearly refried because they were let to get cold in the window, they had soaked up so much oil I couldn't choke them down. It isn't like we made a ton of changes, just added lettuce to a sandwich, and got a few extra sides of dressing. After waiting nearly 15 min to find a server to come help us, we expressed our issues and requested that the food be taken back to fix, she rushed away so fast that I didn't have a chance to ask for a roll up to eat my salad or request some more water. I am 8 months pregnant and dehydrate and frustrate easily. I tried to keep my cool, but honestly they were very slow and this was just ridiculous. Once our corrected food came back to the table it still wasn't right, but I was too hungry to care by that point and just ate.   She still took forever to come check on us and bring the check.  I am more writing this review in hopes that management sees and works to correct the slack services and the unfortunate kitchen mistakes. Side note, I know its a corporate thing, but charging $1 for a side of ranch is ridiculous. Makes customers feel nickel and dimed and annoyed. Maybe reconsider.   I will be back, but probably one more shot before I take it off the list entirely.",

    "text": "Ok let me start off by saying although I'm a pregnant lady, I don't expect special treatment. However, with another human growing inside you, being hungry is serious business. Thankfully, I wasn't starving when I arrived at Zipps. We were seated promptly and the waitress got our drink order right away. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. She did not return to our table and after 15 minutes, I got up and flagged her down to take our order. Then the wait began. Our waitress never returned to check on us. More then 45 minutes passed before she came back and said our food would be out soon. Another 15 minutes passed and still no food. After waiting over an hour for a salad and sandwich, we finally left without eating. Seriously disappointed.",

I was given a menu with multiple Cup stains but with goo on it guessing from the zipparitas and in addition to that, an hour later I find that two staff members are sitting In the same exact booth I asked for. I understand if you wanted to reserve that booth for guests of more than two to catch the game, but the fact that you allowed TWO staff members to sit at that booth that you couldn't allow TWO customers to sit at during the game is a joke. Our server was great, attentive and did a great job during a busy crowd.",
