Service is hit or miss - sometimes we'll get a great waiter sometimes we'll get a mediocre \"I don't want to be here\" waiter. Avoid the steaks - overcooked and not seasoned. Pretty cool atmosphere, I mean, the place is literally underground hence the name. Molten lava cake was, um, not a molten lava cake but a fully cooked chocolate cake. Overall, not bad but not great either.",

After a short visit back the memories started pouring back just as a clear and heavy as the drinks they dish out!!!!  Any of the appetizers are amazing during the happy hour and the crowds whether they are there or not doesn't even matter because the bartenders are awesome conversationalists.  I LOVE the feel of the restaurant.  Its kind of a dungeon when you first come in with a distinct scent but mehhhh it's damn good once you get down and grubbin'.",

We had reservations and we had to wait a bit to be seated but, without any complaints from us, we were apologized to multiple times and offered free cocktails. The people were very genuine and hardworking. Once we were seated there was no lack in service and our needs were addressed immediately. We got our drinks for free, which was fantastic and generous of them. I would return for the service alone... But then we tried the food. Wow. We had the sauteed shrimp San remos and it was so delicious... Very rich, a perfect blend of garlic, butter, portobello mushroom, sun dried tomatoes and who knows what other secret (crack) ingredients. YUM. We couldn't help but dip our bread in the extra sauce. The New England clam chowder was thinner than I've had in the past but full of clams instead of weighed down with endless potatoes-- very tasty.  We ordered steak and an ahi tuna special. The steak was large, juicy and steakhouse quality. The ahi was cooked perfectly-- seared and rare in the center with tasty, but not overwhelmingly blackened, spices. They brought a free dessert for my birthday. Despite telling our superior server, Chuck, that we had no room for dessert, he insisted we get it and take it to go. We got a chocolate lava cake type dessert with raspberry and it was rich and super yummy.  Everything was delicious, the service was over-the-top accommodating and we were so very impressed. If you love seafood and want a unique environment with delicious food and outstanding service, please do not miss out on the chance to try The Salt Cellar.",

We had the Maryland Crab Cakes and Oysters Rockefeller for appetizers (both delicious!!), 20 lbs of bread rolls (ok, maybe it was a little less than that, but they were tasty!). For dinner I had the Alaskan Halibut with Lemon Caper Butter, and it was so flaky and moist and seriously probably the best fish I've ever tasted! My husband had the Sauteed Sea Scallops, and when he first offered me a bite I said, \"no thanks, I've never been a fan of scallops\" but because EVERYTHING so far had been so delicious, I knew I just had to give them a chance - THEY WERE DELICIOUS!! So flaky, and sweet, and nothing like any other scallop I've ever had (to be fair, I've only tried scallops at places similar to a red lobster, so it's understandable I thought they were all rubbery, tasteless, little salt chews).   The atmosphere of the restaurant was the perfect escape from a hot desert day - dark and cool and romantic. I read some other reviews that talked of it feeling claustrophobic, but I couldn't see that at all. It is a smaller venue, but the tables and people were all nicely spaced out, to give it a more open feeling. I'm still having dreams of those amazing scallops, and will definitely be back soon!",

The mussels smelled a little weird - not sure if it was the broth it was cooked in or the accompanying sauces but something tasted and smelled very weird.  Oysters were good - but kind of expensive.  14 for 6, 1.50 if you go to the bar at happy hour.  Stuffed shrimp was not that great.  Alaskan crab legs had a great flavor infused in them.  The sides were not terrible, but not very good - think Red Lobster with much less butter and seasoning (less butter=good, less seasoning=bad).    All in all, this is a solid seafood restaurant.  The prices are kind of hefty and I wasn't thrilled with the entree portions.  Recommend just getting appetizers if that.  I will probably go back for oysters at the bar if for anything.",

We had the Alaskan king crab legs with rice and vegis - which has to be one if the best meals money can buy. The expert waiter cracks the crab to perfection- leaving you to dip the very large and incredibly sweet crab meat into the melted butter - and experience a True feast! San Rimo shrimp dish is also excellent - both in appetizer or pasta dinner. Owner Richard Huie chatted with us and thanked us for coming on our way out. A wonderful experience that is always consistently excellent every time we dine at the Salt Cellar.  5 star all the way.",

Maybe space underground is at a premium?    We had requested a booth after a suggestion in another review, and were accommodated after a short wait in the bar.  Good decision as seating is somewhat tight, but those booths are huge!  Seafood is obviously their specialty, but there are beef and chicken options on the menu as well.  We started with Shrimp San Remo as recommended by our server, and it was definitely recommendation worthy.  I could have skipped the shrimp and just had the bowl of sauce and a basket of bread and been completely happy.  I ordered scallops, sauteed in butter and sherry with fresh mushrooms.  How can you go wrong there?  Only if the scallops are gritty or overcooked, and they were neither.  Perfect.  My husband ordered another recommended dish, baked stuffed lobster.  A whole lobster stuffed with shrimp and crab.  Tell me that isn't an ingenious idea!  But here's one of my favorite things about Salt Cellar.  I like crab, but never order it because it's just too much work to eat it.  Not here.  They do the dirty work for you at the table.  Now that's a reason for me to go back, even if I have to look at gold picture frames!",

The server immediately removed my plate and let the chef know of the error.  The server said the steak would take 14 minutes to cook.  By then my husband would be done eating his meal.  So I sat there watching my husband eat his meal.  My husband ordered the blackened halibut, I took at bite and the fish was very dry and burned around the edges.  I tasted the carrots and the they were not cooked all the way, they were still hard.  The baked potato was the size of a roma tomato and it was also dry.  What a waste of time and money.  I spoke with Marie the manager and she came across as not caring and let me know that my steak was removed from my bill.  I would have been very upset had she charged me for a meal I did not eat. She didn't do anything to have me want to come back.  Save your money and go to a more reputable restaurant that knows how to serve delicious meals.",

The Halibut was superb, fresh moist and cooked to perfection. I had the Wellington and OMG so good. Tender and cooked to perfection as well. Our only issue was a very annoying and loud couple next to us, who came in at the end of our meal and made sure the whole restaurant knew they were there.

Don't really know how this restaurant stayed in business so many years, you have to be blind, dead taste buds or simply money waster to go to this place twice.  No good service, no decent atmosphere (tables are to closed to each other), nothing on the walls, ceiling has black painted egg carton and most important the food is not even close to the heavy dollars you drop in there, which shouldn't be a problem if you'll want an exciting experience out of it. Not here though  \\_()_/ ",

I think placing lights on the edge of each step would help those who have sight / walking issues. I made a reservation online one week prior as it was our anniversary. We were not listed on the reservation list. The hostess mumbled something about not checking the online reservations. NOT good as our anniversary dinner could have been a complete nightmare. Sounds like a management issue. However, business was light so they accommodated us and we were seated quickly.   Our Server Toni was awesome. She made recommendations and we took her up on them. Food was as advertised - outstanding!   We will be back and recommend it to anyone who enjoys great steak or seafood. The ambiance of this unique restaurant is perfect for a date night - just don't make your reservations online or ask for a window seat.",

Was there for my babes 25th birthday. So it would take a lot to mess up the evening. food was great. Dad complained that the lobster was smoked. So he wasn't overall thrilled with that aspect of the 3.5 lb lobster which coming from massachusettes, he knows what lobster taste is ideal. Tried babes scallops. I never eat scallops, but when she offered. I dug right in. Not sure if they are supposed to be gritty. But i think they needed to be prewashed a lil more.  Other than that everything was great. Ambiance is amazing. I'll be back regardless. Freshest seafood in AZ i'd say besides oceanclub",

While the ambiance was nice and the wait staff was efficient, they could not make up for a very high priced Red Lobster type dinner.  After being seated, our first warning was when the waiter mentioned that the salmon and tuna were not wild, but farm raised.  Any restaurant that builds their reputation on seafood, knows to only serve fresh and wild, not farm raised.  My wife who is an unofficial clam chowder aficionado, had a small bowl as an appetizer, and had to send it back.  It was the worst she has ever tasted.  I ordered the crab cakes as the entree expecting them to be fresh and meaty Maryland crab.  Unfortunately, while the crab was large, and the filler kept to a minimum, they had no crab taste, suggesting that they were not fresh crab, but either made from canned crab or imitation crab.  A very disappointing experience.  We will not return. Red Lobster would be a better choice for a better meal and half the price - and we are not Red Lobster fans.  Next time Blue Water Grill or Mastro's Ocean Club.",

My conclusion is that Red lobster would've been a better choice. The menu is extremely, extremely over priced. My boyfriend & I opted to share a couple different appetizers. The clam chowder was not a chowder, it was the runniest soup I had ever had. Flavor was average. The crab cake appetizer however was very filling and flavorful. The calamari however was the absolute worst. The consistency was horrid and the smell was incredibly rank, it smelt like a stinky foot. The plate presentations were the laziest I've seen for this \"fine of dining\". Some sprigs of parsley and a giant leaf of lettuce is a joke. Really expected more out of this place. Plus 3.50 for a Sprite? Really? Don't waste your money here!",

I always go during Happy Hour when prices are cheaper because this place is rather expensive. Oh seating is not suitable for really large groups. There's a bar and then there are smaller tables in a separate small room.  Other than the prices, the food is good and the atmosphere is great. It has that private posh bar feel with dim lighting. Try the turtle soup, steamed mussels and the raw oysters. The steamed mussels can be eaten without any sauce. It's that tasty. The escargot is nice too. The baked oyster was kind of bland. But you'll have to try it yourself.  This place is for people that want to be fancy for the night. Eat and drink like an important person. Service is not bad and the food is good. And like I said, it's unique atmosphere. Just be prepared to pay the premium for it.",

We arrived about 45 minutes early and had appetizers and drinks at the bar. Service and the shrimp cocktail were awesome!  The hostess was able to seat us early which was nice, but we were surprised by the small the tables and the close quarters in the small dining area that we were in. I suppose it is a good use of space but be prepared for tight squeeze. It is fine once you get used to it. It didn't bother us much but a group of four came and were really bothered by it and complained but decided to stay. We ordered the New England clam chowder which was the best I've had in awhile. We planned to get more seafood but when we saw Beef Wellington on the menu we had to get it!  We were not disappointed!  We had the Creme Brulee for dessert and it was perfectly done!  Overall great experience, prices are high but that is expected since this you're getting fresh seafood in Arizona. It's a landmark, it's been featured on the tv show \"Check Please, Arizona\" with excellent reviews. Highly recommend you try it at least once!",

It would be a great place to go on a date or bring a parent for a nice dinner. We grabbed a seat by the bar and ordered our dirty martinis. It was made pretty well. The bartenders seemed pretty busy so it was hard to get anything, but they were always nice when they did serve us. There were a few gentlemen to our side who ordered a slew of appetizers. Everything looked good! It would be a great place to come for happy hour or reverse happy hour and enjoy good seafood.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to the Salt Cellar yesterday for the first time. We met up with our friends, another couple. To take advantage of the happy hour menu....we had to sit in the bar area. Understood. We ordered food and drinks. I ended up ordering 4 half shell oysters after I tried some of my husbands and really liked them. When the waitress brought them out, one of the oysters was practically non - existent in its shell. We giggled about it and my husband pointed it out to the waitress--being completely friendly. The waitress in turn looked at the plate, said nothing, turned around and walked away and then rolled her eyes! BEYOND rude! Did not acknowledge it at all & was clearly very irritated. My husband then approached the lady at the front to let her know what just happened and how rude she was. She listened, but did absolutely nothing about it. Another waitress helping us (we had 3 waitresses by the way) corrected the situation and brought me another oyster. We wanted to speak to a manager, but found out the lady at the front that my husband spoke to--the one who did not budge when we told her what happened, was the owner's wife! When the rude waitress did what she did, the owner's wife was right next to us because we were sitting at the bar by the door, right by the hostess podium. Clearly, this waitress DID NOT CARE at all! We pretty much came to the conclusion that the rude waitress was a family member of the owners. We spent over $200 for food and drinks between the 4 of us during the not so happy hour yesterday. Needless to say--we will NEVER go to the Salf Cellar again. First and last time. Great oysters...HORRIBLE waitress and an owner who did not do anything about it--fell on deaf ears. It is because the owner failed to be apologetic or even acknowledge that we were mistreated by one of her staff that we will not return. We spent a lot of money here. I will spread the word to everyone too.  P.S. The rude waitresses name was Alicia",

I called to make a reservation for next Friday- we are going out with friends to celebrate my husbands birthday and he is craving seafood. The hostess who answered the phone was very polite and sweet, but said they don't take parties of 15 on the weekends. She said that she would put me on hold and ask the manager... She came back and politely told me that the manager said they just can't do a party like that on a weekend. Welp... That's pretty crummy. We love good food and strong drinks and our money is as green as the other 15 people who will be dining at the salt cellar instead of us. I don't know about you, but I'm not one to go out and celebrate with friends mid-week. Just wanted to let you know if you're looking for a restaurant to celebrate with a group, this won't be the place for you.",

Just wish the portion size were just a bit more and the price was a bit less. But will definitely be going there again to have something different on the menu because if they can make fish and chips this great the rest of the meals must be fantastic. The beer and drinks were served in smaller than usual glasses put charges the same price as if it were 12 ounces or more",

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye.  What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered.  What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style.  Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet Veggies, blah. Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh.   In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English.   I've had it with this place. If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",

I do wish there were wine specials (hint hint S.C.) but the food is so outstanding, I couldn't care less about the drink specials they actually do have ($2.75 well drinks & fairly priced beer for those who DO care).   My friend & I shared several apps which is the best way because you get to try a bit of everything. We devoured almost the entire bucket of mussels that come with a white wine sauce and of course, warm butter. Then the escargo and oysters rockefellar showed up and it was all I could do to not inhale the snails. Ha, that rhymes...anyhoo, be careful not to dive in right away because you may burn your esophogus. Just a fair warning.  The Salt Cellar exceeds with service and delicious food -- it's almost 2nd nature to them -- but the plate presentation all the way down to the side sauces add to every bit of mouth orgasm you can imagine...and this is just happy hour at the bar! Just wait til you can try their entrees!!  I love the Salt Cellar for it's food, but the chill, intimate & classicly styled atmoshere adds to the enjoyable experience. Of course, a great friend who makes you laugh is the bright cherry on a terrific sundae. Or in our case, a Wednesday night :)",

Staff was very friendly and personable. I had the Alaskan crab legs (my first crab experience) and I thought they were delicious while my bf said they were the best he's ever had. We also ordered the sauteed shrimp appetizer as an entree (comes with pasta, mushrooms, artichoke) and that was absolutely exceptional! Great flavor and portions.  Only downside is the prices are high but as long as you are prepared for that going in, it's a great place for special occasions or groupons!",

I could have forked something off of a neighbors plate if I had been desperate! It really didn't bother me though. Out waiter was helpful with the menu and helped me find the best scallop choice for me (the one with portabella mushrooms, it was amazing!)

Can't eat at the bar. Let me say that again.  YOU CANNOT EAT AT THE BAR AND NO ONE THERE -- EVER -- HAS BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER THE ONE, LITTLE, ITTY, BITTY QUESTION: Why? They don't know.  I don't know and if it's not a problem, isn't the customer always right?  Used to be.  And if they don't know it's stupid, they're stupid.  2/ Prices are at least 10% over market. For example, salmon is $34 Salt Cellar. A very similar sized piece of salmon at Grassroots: $26. Is it 10% or more better.  Sometimes.  But I can't eat at the bar.  Service ranges from terrific to non-existent.  The service at the bar is ok for drinks but I CANNOT EAT AT THE BAR.  I want to love this joint.  It's local, it's local owner/operator...why wouldn't i love this joint?  Because it's overpriced, over-ego-ed, AND YOU CANNOT EAT AT THE BAR!",

We ordered some drinks from the bar. The bartender is amazing, great lemon drops, really good wine selection. The salad was nice and cold and crisp, wonderful house vinagarette dressing. Everything was really top notch. The server then brought me a creme brulle for my birthday. The only thing I would say is if you don't come here really hungry, be prepared to leave with left overs. The serving sizes are huge. Best seafood in the southwest.  Great service, great food, great staff.",

The scoot us into a very small and crowded bar area where we order a couple very expensive drinks while we wait for a table.

Last visit was disappointing but I thought it was possibly a rough off night for the restaurant.    This visit was extremely disappointing and this was a consensus for the group.   The quality DOES NOT meet the price.   Filet cooked incorrectly and overpriced.   We early didn't eat or like the mussels and the server or manager did nothing to remedy or apologize.   Appetizers were very very small and overpriced.   Our fish dishes were of low quality.   The baked potatoes, which are extremely inexpensive to buy, are very small and of low quality. You think they'd actually spend an extra 30 cents on their potatoes and serve large quality baker potatoes and serve them warm enough that the butter will melt.    Their vegetable or the day was cold and the Gouda sauce on top was cold as well.   We will not be returning and will deter people from going as well.   The food quality was worth about 1/3 of what we paid.  And, I think I'm being generous.",

I saw the bar tender polishing wine glasses to remove water stains. The server was very professional. Manager (owner maybe?) seemed genuinely interested in our experience as we left.  The place is 30 years old but is meticulously kept up. Looks like it could have been opened 5 years ago instead of 3 decades.

I knew this was an upscale restaurant, I had been wanting to check out this underground restaurant for years just never made it in. It was as I imagined, you go down the stairs and indeed a very nice, romantic, quaint restaurant and bar area.    While our steaks were magnificent, the service is what really stood out for me. Our waiter was charming, friendly, helpful and funny.  The prices are expensive, our bill for 2 steaks, a few drinks and desert came out to 150 with tip. So somewhere I'd go more on special occasions.  Tip- try the chocolate martini. So good!",

I really had no idea the extent of this place before I came here for the first time with fellow, famed (Tampa) yelper Steve E. The Salt Cellar is, literally, located in a cellar underground and has been an area staple for almost 40 years. They have mostly seafood as well as steak, and the food and service are excellent. On my first visit I had the ahi tuna with couscous, which was amazing, and there was enough left to snack on the next day. Good choice Steve!  I recently returned with my boyfriend for his 28th birthday celebration. As expected, the food was astoundingly good - this time, ahi and crabcakes - and the service was top-notch. They comped our dessert (the chocolate and caramel gelato, a repeat for me) which was much appreciated.  This is a great option for an upscale date or business dinner. Make sure you get a reservation and give yourself some time to enjoy everything. You won't be disappointed here. I'll be back!",

I've lived in AZ since 1971 and never had made it to this restaurant.  Karma was with us on this Friday night, from the moment we drove in the parking lot and got the last spot.  We were greeted with a wonderful lady, later to find out was the owner, and as we told her, \"no, we don't have a reservation\", she said that she would see what they could do.  This was a Friday night folks.  They found a nice little table with an atmosphere that only matches the incredible reputation this restaurant has had for years.  The server, Diana, was wonderful and we had the wonderful food and best dining experience.  This is truly a special place.  I will definitely return for a special occasion with the hubby and make sure I make a reservation.",

For starters we had a spicy shrimp dish. The sauce (good and spicy) was I believe chili peppers in an oil base which was excellent for dipping the rolls, shrimp was cooked to perfection. My entree choice for the night was the swordfish with vegetables a side of King Crab legs. Nice portion of succulent swordfish with tender carrots. The king crab was steamed just right. My son had a baked lobster and was very pleased as well. The restaurant is underground with comfortable seating, nice decor, and a casual upscale vibe. Ended the night with a good pour of Basil Hayden Bourbon from the bartender. Everyone we came in contact with employed by Salt Cellar were professional, friendly, and made sure our experience was great. First timer and looking forward to the next time. KP",

    "text": "I love the Salt Cellar for being the lazy woman's go-to place for seafood.  If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.  While the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.  The ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.  The lighting for me is too yellow for me, and everything in general seems antiquated.  I remember eating here years and years ago, and it seems like they haven't changed anything about the decor since then!",

Clams from New England, Steak from New Zealand, Crabs from Maryland, etc. My first experience was a weeknight in August with a friend. We were fortunate to be seated in Toni's section. Toni is knowledgable, friendly and offered fantastic suggestions.   The oysters were incredible, very large and flavorful. It was my first time having turtle soup and I was very impressed - Salt Cellar delivered on all the build up of the controversial dish. The sauteed scallops were exceptional. I tried to request a quart of the sauce to-go, but to no avai. The crowning glory is the Maryland Crab Cakes. They have large pieces of Crab, with only enough of the other ingredients to hold it together. They are grilled to a crispy goodness. I have returned 4 more times, and always order them.  The restaurant is an actual cellar, making for fun conversation - be sure to check out the ceiling carefully. The restaurant atmosphere is a balance between upscale and comfortable - great for romantic dinner or family events. On weekends, it's a popular date place. The bar offers a slightly more casual atmosphere. Alex the bartender is personable and makes a great drink.  This place is an excellent choice for both tourists, locals and regulars.",

Salad was drenched in dressing and the Ceviche was FULL of capers and the Halibut that was part of the Ceviche. Service was impeccable which saves the meal. I am not sure why this restaurant is still in business - maybe it's the only fair restaurant in South Scottsdale. The customer next to us had the lobster and was also big time disappointed.",

Returned last night.  It was even a better experience.  Initially, we got reintroduced to Dale, the bartender who has been there since 1987.  He initially offerred to let us taste a couple of Chardonnays when we were unable to select one.  We then had a combined serving of steamed clams and mussels (half priced on the Happy hour menu (4-7).  The Shrimp San Rameo was excellent.  8 shrimp with portobello mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes, along with garlic aND onion.  Great combination.   Dinner is why we are raving about this place.  My Beef Wellington was the absolute best.  They use actual pate.  It was perfectly cooked, baked, and the filet was rare.  Marvelous.  Their idea of surf and turf is to include a whole 1 1/4 lb. Maine lobster, fully cracked with a 7 oz filet, cooked au poivre by request.  No better dinner around.",

    "text": "I WISH I COULD GIVE SALT CELLAR ZERO STARS.  If you enjoy being treated as if you are an unworthy piece of crap, you will love Salt Cellar.  Short version:  We were asked to leave because we were ordering drinks and appetizers, not entrees. We received horrible treatment from top down: owner, manager and server because we weren't spending enough money... and the money we were spending (probably around  $200+ total) wasn't worthy of a table. Now myself, my family, nor the friends I was with will ever spend another dime in this poor-excuse for a \"service industry\" establishment ever again.  Details: Myself along with four other coworkers came here after work on a Friday to order drinks and food. We all arrived separately between 5-5:30 and put our name in for a table because the bar area did not have enough open seating for us. Two rounds of drinks and about 40 minutes later, we are seated. The waitress offered transfer our bar tab to our new waitress at the table, but we wanted to pay the bartender, to ensure he was getting tipped for his time helping us at the bar.  Once we were seated, we ordered appetizers, and we continued to order drinks.  About 45 minutes in, the server came over and proceeded to say that if we are not ordering dinner, Salt Cellar needs to use the table for people who actually will be ordering dinner.   So, we, paying customers, need to leave our table because we aren't ordering food of a certain price point? Mind you, we weren't just taking up space, we were still ordering food and drink!!!  Naturally, our reaction was to question her action. She stood firm. We went to the manager to explain what had just happened. Then, the MANAGER essentially said yeah, if you aren't ordering dinner, we need you to leave the table because there are people waiting to eat dinner. Was extremely rude about it, too. (weird concept, waiting for a table at a restaurant, right?)  That alone made us want to leave, and also made us realize that our waitress was probably told to say that, and it probably wasn't her fault. So on our way out, I apologized to our waitress for the way I reacted.   The owner overheard me apologizing and asked what was going on, and I proceeded to tell him about our experience. To which he, THE OWNER, responded by telling me that I was wrong. Said we couldn't sit at the table if we weren't ordering dinner. He said that we \"misrepresented\" our intentions of what we would be ordering (we never said we wanted dinner) Anyway, I told him that it's wrong to treat customers that way, and he argued me. Told me I was wrong and we need to leave.    Just FYI: we are not a rowdy crowd, we were not loud, annoying, inappropriately dressed. We are are all professionals who had just come from the office and wanted to go to (what we thought was) a decent place to enjoy each others company outside of work.",

My husband ordered the crab cakes and they were way more cake than crab.  Baked potatoes were lukewarm and the poor broccoli was smothered in some unidentified sauce.

It was a challenge to have all 22 coworkers served dinner at the same time. We were seated at two tables of 11. For a large party we should have preordered our meals. I enjoyed the fresh in season Nantucket scallops. The scallops were very lightly breaded. The taste was sweet and tender. Without a doubt they were the best scallops I have ever had. I enjoyed the creamy tarragon salad dressing in the greens and cherry tomatoes. I sampled the outstanding Oysters Rockefeller. Again, these were the best Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had. The meal, atmosphere made for a fun and enjoyable evening.",

It's ok not great, ordered the lobster and I believe seabass and they were just ok. The pricing on the other hand, not so much, at around $50 per plate, expected much better food. If you want better sea food and service in the same price range, go to Mastros Oceans Club. Also Orange Sky has much better seafood and service in my opinion. If you just want pricey great food, go to Donovans, Hillstone (not so pricey), Steak 44, many other options. First and last time here.",

They are friendly and thoughtful, offer genuine suggestions and never let you go without whatever you may need. The menu includes fresh Maine lobster, other seafoods, and specialty beef selections. The wine and spirit selection is always more than adequate. The food quality can't be beat, especially for a seafood restaurant in Arizona.

Or, maybe it's because it is just the coolest seafood place ever!  You walk in and it's just stairs heading downstairs to the underground bar and restaurant.  As you walk up to the host/hostess you pass by the live lobster tank and take a look at which one you are going to feast on later.  Or, you walk right past the host/hostess and head straight to the bar.  Such a cool bar, solid wood and very classy, old school Charleston Era / Speak Easy vibe.  They have a decent happy hour in the bar with a pretty extensive food choice on it until 7pm.  In fact, lately when I go, I typically sit in the bar and order Happy Hour items.

Our server Mike was very attentive and was knowledgeable about all of the menu items and offered some of his favorites which I ordered, the baked lobster, was beyond anything I have ever ate!  Yes, it's pricey but well worth it for the quality of seafood that we had.  I will go back for sure!  Thank you Salt Cellar and Mike for the unforgettable dinner!",

I got the 3lb stuffed lobster and this was my first lobster and it was fantastic and they crack it for you!

The service was subpar, I felt like the staff felt irritated and inconvenienced by our presence. Food is alright, definitely not worth the $40+ a dish they charge though. We got ceviche to start and it was very heavy on the tomatoes, so it was incredibly acidic and even a bit sour and bitter, I would pass on it. I got the Ahi and it was pretty dry, my partner got the grouper which I tried and had the same experience. Salad is good, baked potato was good. Dessert was eh. The creme brulee was yummy, but I found the lava cake to be weirdly salty? Overall, not a great experience probably won't be back.",

On the day I came here, I missed the exit from the freeway and was driving up Hayden Rd to get back to Scottsdale eventually, when my friend said there should be a good seafood restaurant nearby, and when he spotted this place, we decided to try here instead.  Taking the stairs down, I felt like I was going down to a wine cellar. It's such an old school, I felt like I was back in time. Apparently they haven't changed for over 40 years. I liked their classy ambiance.   Server said halibut was fresh so we shared halibut ceviche. Fish was fresh and really liked the taste of ceviche. It was so hot that night, fresh appetizer was perfect choice.  Yakimono Hawaiian ahi had a great flavor. One of the best ahi I had before. Outside was charred just perfectly, I enjoyed every bite of my ahi.  Portion size was very big. I didn't have enough room left in my tummy for desert.   Server was as friendly as he gets. He sounded like he's been working there for a long time and knew what he was doing. I had such a good time there that night, I hope I can come back here again soon.",

I recently had the Alaskan Halibut Cheeks, which I have never seen on any other menu here in the desert of Phoenix....these cheeks were unbelievably amazing. They also were featuring a special for the month of August called a \"Clam Bake\", included a dozen steamed clams, one pound and a quarter lobster and an ice cold draft beer PLUS veggies, a side salad and baked potato... ALL of that goodness for $45... does it get any better that that? I don't think so.   As a pretty serious \"yelper\" and foodie, I once again recommend this place to anyone out there who loves great seafood, outstanding service and unique atmosphere. You really can't go wrong.   Go for it seafood lovers!",

This place has a unique atmosphere: they call it a cellar and it lives it up to it's name because the outside is so unassuming.  There are two small buildings at ground level and you walk down some wooden steps into this lively seafood haven.  First of all, the bar took good care of us as we waited for our table.  Huge selection of mixed drinks and even a decent choice of single malt whiskeys/scotch.    The food itself was amazing!  We had the oysters Rockefeller for appetizer and they were divine.  I had blackened swordfish and and my buddy had the scallops off the Captain's special menu and frankly it was the best tasting swordfish I have ever had.  I do not know how they seared it but it was perfectly tender and tasty.  Beware at it is intensely busy on the weekends but it is so worth it.  Order the house salad with blue cheese and italian dressing- weird mix but great on the taste buds.  I definitely recommend this place if you are stopping by Phoenix and sampling the food scene!",

I also ordered a side of clam chowder - I'm from MA. and I can tell you this was really good. For dessert we ordered a slice of Snickers cheesecake and shared it. Everything was great.

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant twice now, and both times have been a disappointment. The first time my party ordered the surf and turf for each person. Ultimately, the seafood (crab cakes for an appetizer and lobster tail with the meal) were decent - nothing special though as someone who comes from a place where fresh seafood is abundant. As for the filet mignon, it tasted as if someone had basted it in maple syrup. For the prices, I expected the steak to be at least edible (everyone left it on their plates practically untouched after the first bite). The desserts were excellent though, so we took a chance and returned for a birthday this evening planning on sticking to just seafood and desserts.  Unfortunately, we never even made it to our table. The staff made an error and didn't put us in line to be seated, which was an error I would have been more than willing to overlook despite waiting almost thirty minutes past our reservation time. People make mistakes. No big deal. My issue came with their handling of the matter though. After speaking with the hostess we continued to wait, never saw a manager or anyone come over to say so much as \"sorry for the wait - can we get you anything while we clear your table?\", and the only time they even appeared to feel badly was when we left and took our money with us. The single exception to this was the bartender who saw us waiting and chose to comp our sodas before we left, and if anyone at your establishment reads this review please know that your bartender is about the only good thing we experienced while there this evening. I've never gotten such an impression from a restaurant that I'm literally just a dollar sign and an inconvenience otherwise. If I'm paying $200 for two people to eat, I expect a little more decency from the people running the place than what was evident this evening (sans the excellent bartender). I will not go back and will recommend my friends and family also not bother wasting their time and money there after experiencing both bad food and now similar service.",

We ordered a shrimp cocktail which was really good, the fresh bread and salads were also tasty.   My husband was surprised at the tiny glass of beer you can order there but he liked it.   The issue was really with the main course. My beef wellington was basically RAW. I saw another photo of a different version on Yelp that looked perfect but mine was so under-cooked. They said they didn't want to let the pastry get burned but I don't think they pan-seared the tenderloin before it was wrapped. I mentioned I am pregnant so having well cooked meat is important. Also, there was something so horribly wrong with the sauce. It was so sour! Yucky. The veggies that came with it were under seasoned at best.   My husband ordered another steak with fried shrimp. His steak was charred on the outside. You cant really get that carbon taste out of your mouth even if the center is good. I don't know if they had a bad night with the beef or if this is what they regularly serve. At $35+ a plate, it was very disappointing.  Lastly, the snickers cheesecake seemed to be really tasty but it was covered in a chocolate-amaretto sauce. That was not described to us at all and when I tasted this, I knew it had alcohol in it immediately. It was yet another thing I could not eat.  The seafood seemed ok, maybe we should have stuck with that?  We wont be returning.",

We wanted to do something out of our normal box so we headed to The Salt Cellar (bonus as it's super close to our house) and we got there about 15 minutes to spare before happy hour ended. We found two spots at the side bar but decided that if two seats opened up at the bar we'd take those...well, two opened up and we sat right down. We looked at the menu and quickly ordered so we could still get the happy hour prices. I had 1/2 dozen oysters, escargot, and an oyster shooter, my boyfriend had the clam chowder and shrimp cocktail. We also each ordered a drink. Our bartender Alex was awesome!!!! My oysters came out and they were AMAZING! I cannot wait to go back and get more! My boyfriend really enjoyed his shrimp cocktail as well. Then my escargot came out and it was so garlicy and good!!!! The clam chowder was also very satisfying.

The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic date night, or even a special evening out with friends or family.  I love that it's local and not a chain, and is tucked away underground.  The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is my most recent dinner there.  The husband ordered steak and lobster and I ordered the salmon.  We both were surprisingly disappointed with our meal.  My salmon was dry and lacked much in the way of flavor, and the hubs said his steak was a bit tough and not very flavorful either.  Our appetizers (crab cakes and steamed mussels) were great, as usual.  I'm not really sure what was up that night - because as I said I've never had a bad experience previously - hopefully it was just an off night.  We'll be back, for sure, since we've had so many good experiences overall.",

First, if one calls for reservations and one specifies that they have more than one child in the group one would that the first thing out of the hostesses mouth would be a polite warning about the non-kid friendly atmosphere solely for the discretion of the reserver. But NNNOOOOOO way...this  greedy establishment wants any dollar they can get since the quality is not worthy.   No high chairs, no kids cups, nothing in plastic, or paper to go bowls, no kids menus. NADA!  Then comes the seafood and steaks. Seafood was so bland it might have just crawled out of the ocean and plopped itself on the frying pan. Sad indeed for a seafood restaurant that should be better than the rest.    The filet was ordered medium but cooked all the way through since the chef opted to butterfly it to save time in hopes of rushing to the next customer and the pressing it to the grill ensured that there was no juices remaining and the char from the grill was the only flavor disguised as steak rub.   My recommendation...dead lobster for seafood and outback for steak and you would be a happier customer than of you dined at this anti-child establishment.",

No table available for over 2 hrs so opted to sit in the bar. Limited menu but the 4 items we ordered were great. We had Shrimp cocktail, shrimp toast, crab cake & smoked swordfish. Husband said swordfish was really really good. They poor a good drink and bar was full of patrons and quite cozy. They do need to do some serious upkeep. The egg carton ceiling is peeling off. Think that can't be hard or expensive to replace....will be back.",

The waiter (Tim) was knowledgeable & personable, and knew how to help me order gluten free items.   Unfortunately, we were disappointed by our entree choices. Grouper was on special and recommended by our waiter but it was battered & quite dry.  The Idaho trout tasted & looked a whole lot more like salmon than any trout we'd ever had! So just not happy with our selections. However we'll go back again when we're in town, and have the scallops!   And creme brulee was a fantastic finish",

    "text": "Salt Cellar 550 N Hayden Rd. Scottsdale, AZ 85257  Companion and I arrived for a 5:00 dinner reservation just a bit early. We were asked to wait in the bar, which would not have been a problem except that every seat was already taken with people waiting. After a short wait, we were seated at our table.   The bar waitress arrived quickly and took our drink order - 20 year old port for myself and a pink squirrel for companion. The port was a Graham and was excellent, and companion loved the pink squirrel. It is notable that the bar has a large stock of premium single malts, ports, and other spirits. Best of all, they have a bartender that has knowledge of what is being served and knows what he/she is doing.  We started our dinner with a bowl of chowder - Manhattan for companion and New England for myself. The chowder had lots of clams and potatoes in it, and instead of being thick and goopy (is that even a word?) it had a nicer, thinner texture that was very enjoyable.  Next came an order of Steamed Mussels. They were satisfactory except that many of the shells did not have a mussel in them. Our waitress made things right very quickly by bringing us a steaming hot new order to replace those. The mussels were cooked perfectly and came with a broth and a melted butter cruet to dip them in. Best of all, the mussels were totally clean with not a drop of foreign material in them.  Next came the salad, perhaps the only weak point in the meal. Two problems presented themselves - first was that the salad itself was either torn into small pieces that were hard to get on the fork, and other pieces were too big to be put in ones mouth without being cut up. The second problem was that we selected the house vinaigrette, which just really wasn't to my personal taste. Not wanting to be a complainer, I ate the salad and accepted it as part of the experience.  The main course arrived next - baked stuffed lobster. Each lobster was stuffed with a mixture of crab meat and scallops, then covered in bread crumbs and baked. The lobsters are smaller ones - about 1 14 pounds I would guess, but after the appetizers and the salad they were more than adequate. The lobsters come with a candle heater with drawn butter in it. I prefer a good salt butter to eat with my seafood, and somehow, miraculously, a small packet of Maldon Sea Salt appeared from my purse to help with the butter. The lobster was delicious and nicely cooked. Our waitress, when serving it took the hard parts apart for us so the eating it was simple and non-messy.   Our only unfortunate part of the evening was that we were seated next to a buffoon cardiologist that insisted on recounting his latest surgery experiences to his table in loud enough tones that the entire dining room found out about his sutures. I did not allow that to affect my appetite though.  Service and cleanliness were excellent as was the food. 5 stars",

Then she forgot to order my husband's filet mignon steak to his swordfish dinner, so that came out last after he had already finished the rest of his dinner. Then the bill came and we were still being charged for the appetizer we never got and it said that they voided my husband's dinner, which would have been cool but we didn't ask for any discounts...but then when you added the bill up it was still in the total. So, we said the bill was off and she brought another check that said the appetizer and my husband's dinner was voided our but only the appetizer was off. It just seemed like they were trying to swindle us with the check and it seemed shady. We're very good tippers...usually around 25-30% especially for good service, but my husband left like maybe $5 on a bill of almost $140. We drove all the way from San Tan Valley to eat here because we heard everything was amazing, but it left a lot to be desired and we probably won't be back sadly.",

Used plates stayed on the table for 45 minutes, silverware was forgotten or not replaced in-between courses, and basic requests kept being missed.   If you are looking for a great place to have happy hour, I highly recommend Salt Cellar but dinner at the cost would probably be better had somewhere else with a higher level of table service.",

Husband had to go up after 30 minutes and ask what the problem was.... they scratched our name off reservation list. While sitting at bar..I ordered a club soda and got a tonic. I told the bartender the mistake and she very rude about it. Finally got to table and ordered. The waiter was awful.  We never once were asked if we wanted drink refills..and finally had to ask another server for water. When you are paying this kind of money for service and food...you should not get this kind of treatment. Our appetizer and salad plates were never removed nor was our empty bread basket. So we looked at a pile of dirty dishes the entire meal. Did not care for the infused salad dressing and wanted to ask for another...but since our waiter didn't come around I was stuck with it. Husband ordered the Beef Wellington which was fair, I ordered the Salmon Wellington and it was good. Plate presentation was terrible. When we finally walked out a man in a suit (we assumed he was the manager) asked how our experience was. We told him that it was horrible and he said NOTHING, NOTHING. The staff just doesn't care. We get better service, seriously from Red Lobster. Will not be returning.",

    "text": "Who'd have thought that in a part of the country where basements are nonexistent, there's a fantastic restaurant that's entirely underground? Salt Cellar has always been my favorite place for sea food in the valley. The quality of the fish is always good and fresh, especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state.   My girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner at the Salt Cellar. She can't eat shell fish, which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu, but there's plenty of good options to pick from. We split a Halibut ceviche appetizer, which may have been the best ceviche I've ever had. Nothing against shrimp, but the Halibut is much more flavorful. I had Swordfish with mango salsa. The mango salsa was unreal. They left everything cut in big chunks, which was a little shocking at first, but it covered the whole fish, and was quite tasty. The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first, but as I got to the center, I found that it was perfectly cooked, and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor. My girlfriend had Mahi. I tried a bite, and it was also delicious.   Entrees are around the prices you'd expect to pay at this type of establishment. But orders come with a salad, vegetables, and choice of potato or rice. Two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees cost a little more than $100 (not including tip). Not bad for a special occasion.   The place is very small (be prepared to be seated a little too close to the party next to) so reservations are a must. For parties of two, you can make them on Salt Cellar's website. They only thing I think Salt cellar needs is an update. While the dim lighting, wood and nautical theme is cool. The walls and art hanging on them walk a fine line between out of date and nostalgic.",

I've been going there for years and years and the past few visits have gotten worse and worse with this past visit the one that broke the camels back and I will never return.  It started with a cold attitude from the hostess, the fun kept going with very bad service at the bar before dinner,  (we were virtually ignored for 10 minutes after sitting down), the mussels about made us sick, the bread at dinner came out as three big slabs of under baked dough, the salads were just thrown together with vegetables that were old,  I sent my $40.00 filet back as it was the worst steak I've ever had (the waitress said it was the third one she returned that night!)  ZERO seasoning and over cooked.  I mentioned it to or waitress who said \"well its just over cooked around the edges\"  REALLY!!  They may want to replace everyone in the back as they obviously don't care what they put out.  My girl friends steak and crab legs were bad as well.  And then to top it off, desert came out and it looked like something my 12 year old son put on a plate. Also, it was so cold in there, everyone was complaining and nothing was done until we were ready to leave!!   Not sure if they have new ownership/management but with all the good restaurants in town they will soon close their doors with this kind of service/food.    Again, sad to see this place circling the drain .. but it was a good run.",

We also ordered Oysters on the Half Shell and Oysters Rockefeller. Those were delicious as well. The Oyster Shots were interesting and fun. $3 Well drinks are great to wash all of this down.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary - we saw a Groupon, checked out reviews on Yelp, and decided it would be a good choice.  WOW, were we wrong!  Going back over the reviews, I'm convinced that no one in AZ actually knows what fresh seafood looks/tastes like.  It certainly can NOT be found at the Salt Cellar.  The meal started with bread, which was meh.  A seafood place that doesn't serve sourdough?  Odd.  The bread was very plain, even though one slice had olives in it.   For an appetizer, we chose crab cakes.  They were at least 50% bread crumbs, had a very slightly canned flavor, and came with a very plain tartar sauce.  Pretty mediocre for $15.  They were cooked nicely, however - nice and crisp on the outside - so we finished them.   Next up, salad.  I had Creamy Bleu Cheese and my boyfriend had House.  Again, meh.  The mix was just iceburg lettuce, some carrot shreds, mushrooms, and one cherry tomato.  The house dressing just tasted like vinegar and oil, the bleu cheese was a little musty.  Then the main course... at this point, Boyfriend and I were thinking that the entree would at least be as good as the appetizer, but hoping for much better.  Based on reputation, how could it suck?  Oh... it sucked mightily!  I had Mahi-Mahi sauteed with Macadamia Nuts (a house specialty), the boyfriend had Salmon Wellington (on their fresh market menu).    Side dishes were a baked potato that was microwaved and a piece of rubbery, inedible broccoli.  The salmon was wrapped in spinach, then in puff pastry, kind of like beef wellington, and served with hollandaise. Sounds promising, right?  It was over cooked, mushy, and tasted old.  The hollandaise tasted like plain butter.  Pretty bad, but still a little edible.  Red Lobster-level quality at triple the price.  The Mahi-Mahi was a disaster!  It was definitely not fresh fish, and actually seemed like it had been cooked hours before I ate it.  It was lukewarm and rubbery, with a pile of candied macadamia's on top.  Even if it had been cooked well, the seasoning and flavor was way too sweet.  After a few terrible, mushy bites, I cut open to the middle - the inside was GRAY and mealy.  DISGUSTING.  I didn't eat any more of it.  In any decent restaurant, if the server sees that the patron hasn't eaten any of their meal, they'll ask what's wrong and try to make it right.  Our waiter didn't even raise an eyebrow.  Either it's poor service or it happens all the time.  So, to sum up, for $100 we got two sodas ($8 for those!), some plain bread, mediocre crab cakes, overcooked old salmon, and pre-cooked possibly near expiration Mahi.  For a meal this quality, save your money and go to Red Lobster.  At least you'll get cheddar bay biscuits!",

The clam chowder (not the manhattan kind cuz that just isn't real clam chowder and I can say that since I'm from Massachusetts) is very good, creamy just like I like it.  The escargot in mushroom caps is good, but I'd rather just have the escargot in garlic butter and do without the mushroom caps (they blocked the True flavors of the dish).  The ceviche was very good and the oysters were good too.  Ambience wise, it is pretty dark overall (well, maybe that is because it is underground).  The bar is cold in both its temperature and its design.  The dining room looks dated.  Overall, if you are going for quality seafood and not ambience, it's a winner!",

    "text": "I worked at the Salt Cellar for over 11 years and I recently started a new restaurant job in Sacramento, CA. Just the other day a table of mine caught wind of the fact that I just moved here from Scottsdale and immediately said, \"My favorite restaurant is in Scottsdale, It's called The Salt Cellar!\" Needless to say I was extremely proud to inform her that I had spent the last 11 years of my life working at her favorite restaurant. Now with that being said I feel like I need to make a couple comments about a few of the reviews I just read... When you go to dine at The Cellar you need to know that it is more than a restaurant, it is an experience. Most people choose to come for special occasions like birthdays or Anniversaries. By the way, they offer a complimentary dessert for those occasions. Most people can not afford the luxury of dining at a pricey restaurant regularly although there are plenty of regular customers that dine there. In my opinion you get what you pay for and if you want to eat FRESH seafood in the middle of the desert, you are going to pay a pretty penny for it. Go to the coast if you don't like the gas prices it takes to ship fresh fish in on a daily basis. The food there is pure. By that I mean it is not spruced up with glazes and sauces to mask the True flavor of the fish you ordered. Some people may think that is bland. But I think if the chef masked the fish with other flavors, he might as well buy it frozen. My last point about the price is, there is no a la carte. When you order an entree there it comes complete with a salad, bread and two sides. I have seen people leave the place leaning forward because their full bellies wouldn't allow them to stand up straight.  There is a review stating that the place is not kid friendly because they don't carry high chairs. Well, personally that is an incentive for me since I don't have kids and would rather not listen to them scream while I'm enjoying my dinner. However, they are very kid friendly. The owner has two beautiful granddaughters who have been dining there since birth. And if you happen to get Cara as a waitress she will probably take your child on a tour of the restaurant to give you a break while you enjoy your meal. It doesn't get much more kid friendly than that! It may seem like my opinion is a little biased, but I have nothing to gain from this review other than spreading the word that this unique little gem of a restaurant needs to be experienced by you. If you are questioning whether or not to dine there based on the past reviews then please take this one into account. It's a unique and unforgettable place. It's privately owned by a couple that care about every guest that walks in the door. If you don't like your dinner, do yourself and the restaurant a favor and say something. Your server will get you a new one or something different. No questions asked. They want you to walk out the door happy as much as you do.  One last thing, in my opinion the best item on the menu is the Alaskan King Crab. Not only is it mouthwatering delicious. Your server will crack it table side for you!",

This place is so charming, I love how its entry door is a little shack, and leaves one with woderment of what is to come once you walk in, and down the staircase.  The lighting is slightly dim, giving way to a great spot for a romantic date, or just an elegant touch to any dining experience.  The seafood is amazing quality, fresh, and although a bit pricey, its worth it as AZ doesn't have an ocean, so save a little to enjoy the dishes here.  My favorite is the salmon wellington, and don't forget about the escargot!  By far the best seafood offerings in Arizona, in my opinion.  When its hot out in the middle of the summer, hide in the Salt Cellar, where its cool and charming.  Its a great place to go to all year long, especially great for birthdays/anniversaries.",

No one offered flashlights or even seemed to notice.  I ordered the swordfish with mango salsa.  The fish tasted fine but there was no imagination in the salsa or the side dishes.  The mango was very tart and overall bland.  My husband had the salmon oscar which is served over bread pudding.  He said the salmon and crab were good enough but again the bread pudding was tasteless and an odd thing to have combined with the seafood.  Salads served with the entree were boring and even the dressing could not help. Our waitress was pleasant enough but seemed to have a superior attitude for some reason.  We were truly disappointed.  With all the outstanding restaurants in this area, I'm surprised the Salt Cellar has lasted this long.  We do not plan on ever returning and will not be recommending it to any of our friends.",

Complaining (politely) only garnered more mediocre food along with a poor attitude.  Tonight we thought, Oh, we'll just try the bar for happy hour. Scott greeted us and seemed pleasant but Dale actually managed to take our order and deliver it without uttering a word. In fact, I thought he was not going to say a word at all until we left. But he must have overheard me telling my husband that NOTHING ( mussels or any of the mystery dipping sauces they came with ) had ANY flavor. The only thing I noticed was a strong smell of sewer. Anyway,  he said \" oh! So Is your stuff any good?\"  I said ,\" Meh. It's ok. but really bland\". At which point he walked away, never to be heard from again. I asked for the check which Scot delivered. The bill was $ 43 and some odd cents and I left $6 and some odd cents.

Needless to say, we will not be returning.",

Staff is always friendly and most importantly the seafood is always fresh! I have to admit I am a creature of habit at this place and always order the king crab legs-they crack them for you!!! It's the simple things in life:) Cell phones don't usually work either so it's a nice escape from listening to people have loud conversations while trying to eat a nice meal.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour and dinner before a play on Friday night. I love that they are underground. It does add a romantic feel to the place.   We started with a couple of oyster shots and stuffed baked clams in the bar. The oysters and clams are $1.50 each during HH and the stuffed baked clams were $1.75 each. The stuffed clams were large and yummy. The shooters were good too but they came with a lot of sauce. They have a cute bar so I can see myself coming here for HH again. My one complaint is that I ordered the stuffed clams when we were in the bar having drinks and they were taking quite some time. While we were waiting the hostess came and got us because our table was ready and told us that they would bring the clams when they were ready to our table. Well we were seated, ordered and got our salads and still no stuffed clams (which I paid for at the bar, they made sure I closed out before I was seated). We notified our waitress and she said that no one had told her anything. She checked and then came back and said they had put in a wrong order and they were just baking. I understand places make mistakes but once someone has been waiting at least 25-30 minutes for something that should have taken 10 at the max, then comp the item or offer a comped dessert. We got neither.   Anyway dinner was good. Their salad had a bit too much of the vinaigrette. I had the stuffed lobster and it was a lot of food. My boyfriend had the petite fillet and said it was cooked perfectly but lacked flavor. I'd still give this place another try.",

The decor of the restaurant is pretty cool- you dine in an underground cellar, which makes the room a little cold, but also makes it a memorable experience.  I've heard that the crab legs are amazing, but personally, I've had the crab cakes and fried shrimp- both delicious.  The dessert was great and the drinks were strong.  Reasonably priced food for the amount and quality you get.",

    "text": "If it wasn't for my friend's Birthday Dinner, I'd never had a chance to go to such a place.  It's almost impossible to notice this place even if you drive by it everyday, from the outside you'd never thought it'd hold more than 10 customers.  Once I opened the door, I went \"oOo\", you walk down the stairs and end up in a basement w/ great ambiance.  The bar is just big enough for you to get great service from the bartender.  The happy hour is great at the bar area if you just want to stop by after work, the only think I had an issue with is that they don't have much beer selection on tap.   After a few appetizers and drinks, we moved to the table, and the smell(smells salty, perhaps from all the sea food they have in the kitchen) and the lighting made me feel like I was on a boat.  There are so many interesting items on the menu, and we went for what we all wanted, lobster & crab.  If it wasn't for my friend's BD, I doubt I'd come here for regular dinner just cuz of the expensive menu...The server was wonderful, cracked all the lobster and crab for us, and also explained the menu clearly for us.  He always came on time(not too often, but never late) to ask if we need to refill a drink, or get a dessert.  The most interesting thing for me is probably the turtle soup, I thought it was great! It kind of reminded me of the chinese herbal soup my mom always cook...and yes, every exotic animal tastes like chicken...  overall, could be a 5 star restaurant for me if they had enough beer selection, or less expensive, but then again, it IS in Scottsdale, so if you got the $$, I'd highly recommend you to check it out!",

    "text": "The husband and I came here for our anniversary and enjoyed it very much. The restaurant was cozy and romantic with an old nostalgic charm. Our waiter rocked and was very quick to refill our drinks and bring our appetizer and meals. He was very friendly and knowing that we were first timers, he explained the menu and was highly informative. We ordered the Shrimp San Remo for appetizer which we probably would not order again. The sauce was flavorful and tasty, however, the shrimp was overcooked. Also, both of us were not happy campers later in the evening and we believe it was because of this appetizer. However, everything else was terrific. For entrees, I opted for the baked stuffed lobster with baked potato and vegi, and the hubby ordered some kind of sauteed scallop special with mushrooms, baked potato, and vegi. Everything tasted fabulous and we were stuffed. One additional note: I love that the waiter offers to crack the lobster crab for you. At the end of our meal when we thought we couldn't eat another bite, our waiter brought us a complimentary slice of snickers cheesecake because it was our anniversary. It was such a nice gesture and I will not lie, the cheesecake was amazing and really did taste like a snickers bar. So in all, this place was very good and a great option for a special occasion. My only complaints were the appetizer (I don't enjoy overcooked shrimp or being in the bathroom for an hour) and I wished the bread they served was warm (seemed like store bought cold bread). One other little side-note: If you hate seafood, this is probably not the place for you. I am not saying this because the menu has a majority of seafood, as you can still find steaks and other non seafood items, but because upon entering the restaurant, you are instantly greeted with the aroma of fish and other seafood. This could be a bit offputting for some. After a few minutes though, you get used to it if you don't mind the smell of seafood. Some people might not be able to get over it and it could be somewhat unpleasant. Additionally, they do sit you fairly close to other parties so if you don't like other people, you may not be happy with the seating arrangements. Lastly, make sure to make reservations as this place gets packed!",

All of the food is very fresh and well-prepared. Salt Cellar is a seafood lovers delight. You won't be disappointed. Service is also equally good.  Salt Cellar would have been given a 5-star review by me but I'm holding back as the pricing is on-par with Mastro's yet the atmosphere is nothing like Mastro's. Personally, I would like to see a few more entree options on the menu with a reasonable price - should that happen, I am more than happy to salute Salt Cellar and revise my review.   Go for the experience and the great food! You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "My GF and I went to dine here prior to attending Hamilton at Gammage.  I completely spaced that it was a Friday night, because I had intended us to dine at a certain Oyster House in Tempe, and so forgot to make a reservation.  I had not been to the Salt Cellar in over 30 years, back in high school, for a prom or such.  My friend at work reminded me of it, and I am glad he did.  We put our name on the list, but also got lucky and found 2 seats at the end of the bar.  Extremely lucky, because it only continued to fill up, which we learned is only a testament to the continued popularity of this underground valley landmark.  Unlike another recent reviewer, we ate at the bar.  However, we did order off the Happy Hour menu, so maybe that might be why?  Not sure, but we are returning there in a couple weeks, so I will inquire and follow up.  We ordered the Oysters on the half shell, Bucket of steamed Mussels, and fresh bread from the HH menu, and also the signature dish, Sauteed Shrimp San Remo from the \"Seasonal Bar Appetizers\" menu.  Strange menu name for a place you supposedly can't eat at the bar at?  Again, maybe you can't order from the standard menu.  The Oysters and Mussels were surprisingly larger than we expected!!  My GF remarked on this, as she is a much more experienced seafood aficionado than I.  The bucket of mussels was very generously sized, so I felt a lot better about the $13 price.  The $2 each oyster price, easily justified by their size. The bread was OK.  The Shrimp San Remo, I thought at the time was great, especially for dunking the remaining mussels and bread in, but my GF told me later she wasn't that impressed with it.  Worth giving a try to decide for yourself.  Definitely rich though, lots of butter and oil.  Drinks were good, service was good, staff attitudes very welcoming, and the ambiance was very nice.  Bartender (1 of 3) was busy, but very professional and responsive.  As I stated, we plan on returning.  I am looking forward to trying some new dishes including the Oyster Rockefeller.  We both remarked that it seemed like there were a LOT of regulars in attendance too, so make of that what you will.  How did we know?  Try becoming a regular somewhere and you will learn how to spot them too.  Word of advice - if you want to impress your date and definitely have access to the full menu . . . make a reservation!!  Fortunately, I have the world's most awesome GF, so she only teased me for a short time about my failure to do so.  However, I suspect that the fact that we left there happily stuffed probably contributed to that leniency too . . . Nah!!!! She's just awesome!!  ;-)",

Upon arrival we were greeted and seated right away and were even accommodated to change the table to a different table. Our server Scott, was excellent.  Not sure where all the 4-5 stars are, but this place seems to have missed the boat for us. I should of gotten the clue when I specifically ordered a Cosmo, not too sweet and it came the color of a maraschino cherry and there was a cherry in it. I did not order a Shirley Temple, I ordered a Cosmo.  Having cocktails while pursuing the menu, we decided on appetizers of the Clam Chowder, 1/2 Oysters, and the Crab Cake. Entrees were the New York Strip Steak, Stuffed Shrimp and the Mussels as an entree. Note all entrees are with a Salad, choice of starch, and vegetable.   Clam Chowder tasted good but consistency was way off like watery (not creamy and thick). Oysters were a good size served with cocktail sauce, where was the horseradish sauce? (always served hand in hand) and had to ask twice for it. Crab cake was very good but for $18 for 1, the tarter sauce it came with tasted and looked like it came out of a jar. Salad, nothing special, croutons out of a box? The New York Strip was a big cut of meat, cooked perfectly, but little to no seasoning. Stuffed Shrimp looked like it was pre-made, patted down into one pile of mush in the dish and heated up, was just very unappealing. Mussels size and quality were very good, perfectly cooked, but they were just steamed, no seasoning in the steaming so they were flavorless. The 2 options of butter dipping sauces were horrible, no taste in the butter at all and I don't know what the other dipping sauce was, but it was not good.  The Restaurant is NOT CHEAP $200+ for a party of 3 for what we ordered, by any standards and for the cost it should be much better in taste. It just missed the mark.",

I understand if this was at a high end fine dining restaurant maybe they can get away with the prices, but it isn't.

There was a bald tall gay man working the bar who obviously hated his job. As soon as we sat down I was unsure what I wanted to drink and right away you could tell he was annoyed. We ordered appetizers (witch he nor the other 80 year old bar back never mentioned one time the happy hour specials) then I ordered my martini and it was like pulling teeth. Thank goodness the food was a 6 out of 10 and that's saying a lot. I will never return and I would discourage anyone to come here and bring a business partner, date, etc. To many other places to drop a few bills plus at.",

    "text": "Not bad, but not particularly good. Very fun walking down into the basement bar and restaurant. Four of came for happy hour. We were seated comfortably at the bar. We came early and that was a good decision. It fills up quickly.   The shrimp cocktails were very good - A- or B+ depending on your standards. The Manhattan Clam chowder was merely ok. No better than a C. If you appreciate a tomatoe based chowder, don't order it here. Go back to NYC.  Finally the Oysters Rockefeller. Meh. Better than some I've had like Casey Moores Oyster House in Tempe - the worst. But not in the league of Durants, downtown - fabulous.   So here is what irritated me. I ask the bartender about happy hour and he says $3.50 well drinks - darn good deal. I order two G&Ts (gin and tonic if you don't know).  About three or four drinks and our appetizers later, I pay the bill and we leave to head to Lon's at Hermosa for phase two. I thought the check was a little heavy, but we were all having fun, so what the heck.   Later that night, I looked at the bill and the bartender had been using Tanqueray and charging me considerably more than $3.50. I can't say whether he was clipping me intentionally or if he misunderstood, but the net is he should have verified. Not pleased. Yes, I should have looked at the bill when I paid it, but it soured a pleasant evening. Memorable food could have made up for a misunderstanding.",

The service was great, although a little rushed until we slowed them down a little.  The wine list was not very large, however they had a full spectrum of choices in all varietals. They also have a large cordial list.  The menu is extensive which made our dinner choices difficult. Our appetizers were on point and the waiter was extremely helpful making any last minute decisions. I especially enjoyed the skewered calamari and the crab cake was excellent. The appetizer portions were reasonable and enough for us to share (I would recommend one app per person). I opted for the Bone-in Swordfish and it was excellent. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. The fresh vegetables were also perfectly cooked. I will definitely come back when I am in town so I can check out more of the menu.",

    "text": "Very hit or miss. It's honestly one of my favorite restaurants when it's good, but when it's bad, it's bad.  To get it out of the way, I'll mention here the happy hour prices are great and worth it.   My favorite food is the salad, with the house lemon vinaigrette. Second favorite, the shrimp cocktail. It's pricey for me, but it's worth that cocktail sauce.  The first time I had crab legs it was here, lobster and oysters too, and they were amazing I believe but I have nothing to compare.  Their sides generally are tasteless but fresh. They have a gouda cheese sauce they put over them in most cases that I want so desperately to like, but it ends up tasting like a plain gravy-like goo.  They also bread alot of their seafood in a way that I think really cuts away from the freshness of the fish. I've had the seafood sampler, and literally everything had a thin, bland breading that really disappointed. I picked most of it off and the fish underneath was delicious.   The service/personality is very spotty. One of the gentlemen at the bar is very....offputting. I've visited with my best friend, a young lady such as myself, and I couldn't help but notice the lack of charm he had toward us...despite not having many people at the bar, we were always serviced last and with a scowl. And yet there's a pretty young woman at the bar on another occasion, who was incredibly pleasant and I applauded her patience when she helped a drunk elderly man next to us use his Uber app to catch a ride.  In the dining, there has been an older woman who seemed like she absolutely hated her job and luckily took most of it out on cracking my lobster rather than myself. But she seemed annoyed by our very presence, and neither I nor my boyfriend are fussy or ask for anything out of the ordinary. We wondered if perhaps she saw we were a fairly young couple and expected us, by statistics, to possibly under-tip. Unsure of her sour mood but it really put a damper on our mood that evening.  The week before that experience, I had made reservations with my boyfriend for his birthday dinner and it was incredible- his first time here and he loved it. I think our server was Mike- he looked just like the actor Chris Parnell and he was incredibly helpful with menu questions and polite. I had mentioned in my reservation that it was the bf's birthday and they ended up serving a complimentary birthday treat for us. I really, truly appreciated that.   This place has potential to be the best if it were just consistent in service and had a little more creativity with the food itself.",

It's a unique experience as it's underground.  However, that does make for a pretty crowded space all around.   There seemed to be quite a few people that were there just to hang out in the bar and given the limited space and mild sense of claustrophobia, that is not something I would choose to do.    The drinks were done well and they have a great selection of spirits at the bar.  The complimentary bread is tasty but the pieces are huge.  Our crab cake starter might well have been my favorite item.  It's super extra crabby and in this case, that is a plus!    They have a case with \"live\" lobsters but I suspect these guys had at least one claw in the dish.  (That, or they all have a terrible case of the thorazine shuffle.)  My lobster was prepared well enough but it was fairly chewy.  My steak was delicious but it was prepared medium rare rather than the medium I requested.  (Thankfully, the lighting was low which made it difficult to see the clear evidence of murder on my plate.)  The amaretto cheesecake was tasty and you get a little glass of amaretto with it.    It's hard for me to balk at prices because they're serving fish in the desert.  But know that it's going to be a pretty spendy evening.     Given that some of our favorite restaurants are just down the road in Old Town, I would probably not choose to come here again.  It was a fun evening and I recommend coming at least once but for me, it won't be a repeat experience.",

    "text": "For our Anniversary my wife, and i went to the Salt Cellar. Making sure to have a nice seat, we made reservations after reading advice to do so on yelp!  We went there for our anniversary, but also to try the food after reading many reviews . Ordering many appetizers, about 4-5 in total during happy hour, and 3-4 entress, we picked at each one. Not eating with an appetite, we took our time tasting all of the dishes! They were all great, and we were happy to be taking how left overs!  Forget Bob D.  and Papadeaux, unless you like glass in your lobster tail... If you looking for authentic, fresh, satisfaction, this is the place to go. If you like the fast food, commercialized seafood quick bite, Papadeaux will probably suite you best.  The food at Salt Cellar is prepared fresh, with the time you woudl expect food like this to take, instead of a 10-15 minute arrival.  The atmosphere was very relaxing, and romantic. The only thing i can say that needed improvement was the hanging, sprayed painted egg cartons, placed on the ceiling as decoration. Many were hanging on for dear life, making us wonder if any would fall on us? Dont let that make you think twice though. It it very well decorated throughout with many theme setting items! Very authentic!  We ordered such appetizers as: Scallops, Crab cakes, Oysters Rockefeller, Shrimp Cocktail, and Steamed Mussels!   Presentation and taste was unbelievable!!! So many great combinations, and the evidence of how frsh everythign was could not be denied!  For Dinner we ordered:  Mahi-mahi, Salmon Wellington, Beef Wellington, and Baked stuffed shrimp! I cant even go into enough detail to explain how great everything was! We obviously had 4-5 to go boxes.  Definetly not cheap, but well worth the price for the quality, service, and atmosphere!! I reccommend this place to any seafood lover! make it a special occasion!  Long review yes, but still does no justice. Salt cellar deserves every word !  Thank you Salt Cellar for your quality in food, and hospitality!  Josh & Angel",

I couldn't even finish it all. My mom ordered the baked stuffed shrimp and cleaned her plate.   It is often hard to find a place to get delicious and fresh seafood in a landlocked state like Arizona, but this is top of my list now!",

They claim their seafood is flown in from the east coast twice a day so that it's truly fresh and the lobster itself was really tasty it was also a bit rubbery. I had the stake and lobster dinner for $50 which included a good size lobster and a small stake with baked potato and carrots and a salad. The stake just wasn't very good. I don't know how else to say it. I also had Manhattan clam chowder soup for $6 as an appetizer. Now that what excellent! The bread was really good too. I had a $6 Margarita that was OK but it was a very small amount and was gone in about 3 sips. To sum it up, the price of my meal was not justified by the taste and I probably won't be returning any time soon.",

But glad I did because they were still pretty busy even for a Thursday.   We started off with the sauteed shrimp san remo that our server recommend and I have to say it was amazing!! Our serve even told us to dip our bread in the sauce and I couldn't stop eating it. I almost wished we had ordered a second one. Would highly recommend getting the sauteed shrimp san remo as your appetizer.   For my entree I got the sauteed sea scallops and add the crab legs as well. They crack the crab for you table side so you don't have to work for your crab which I think is great! My entree was very good, I very much enjoyed both the scallops and the crab was awesome! Almost wished I had just ordered a bigger crab entree. My husband got the beef wellington and crab legs as well. He very much enjoyed the wellington and he couldn't get enough of the crab either!   We had a great time over all and were very happy with everything we ordered. We would for sure go back here and eat dinner again!",

Well I had on heels, a lace peplum top, and some dark skinnies - and the reality is I was over dressed. The older crowd donned cargo shorts, tommy bahama tops, birkenstocks, and the clothes un-befitting of a reservation based establishment.   We made it down the wooden stairs and were seated at a gorgeous table. Our waitress was super friendly and talkative and set us up with some specials and brought us a dozen oysters and a wine sampler.   I ordered the salmon served on an onion cake with asparagus spears in a hollandaise sauce. My fiance got this mahi mahi with this pumpkin macadamia nut sauce.  We finished with a rum dipped cheesecake.   It was ALL amazing. Every bite was divine. The fish was moist. All of the sauces were super complementary.   To this day - our eyes open and we think about the cheesecake. We keep meaning to make reservations to come back, but time, life, and distance get the best of us.   If you're looking for a wonderful dinner - this place. go. don't wait. be on your way!",

A lot of people would disagree with us since it has been in business for 45 years and it was very busy even at 9 o'clock on a Saturday night. But here's our experience. The oysters were good and fresh but not cold enough. The salads were very pedestrian something you would expect a Denny's or some other semi fast food place. My husband had grouper with a so-called thai sauce. The grouper with decent quality but that I thought was Mae ploy direct from the bottle from Safeway or any other Market. My shrimp scampi have garlic and were swimming in butter to the point it looked like butter soup. So there was nothing interesting or complex about the dishes. And it was $170 for two people with two glasses of wine. I have yet to find a seafood place here in town that meets my standards but this certainly didn't.",

    "text": "Had cocktails at bar before dinner with colleagues and customer.  Ordered a Mum Napa champagne split at the bar with cocktail server #18, which was wonderful and have had many times.  Before cocktails were done we were shown to our table.  I ordered another Mum Napa split when seated. The dinner server came and was telling us about the menu and chatting with us.  During this process cocktail server #18 brought my champagne and set it down.   After the menu process with our dinner server, I noticed there was not a split bottle next to my glass(it usually fills glass with some left in bottle) but didn't think much of it.  I took several sips of my drink and noticed a big difference in taste and not having the bottle I was pretty sure it wasn't a Mum Napa but maybe the Prosecco that is also offered.  When cocktail server #18 came by again, I discreetly asked her if this was a Mum.  I did not want to make a scene or anything close to that with business colleagues there. Cocktail server #18 said indiscreetly, \"you saw me pour it, it was a Mum\".  Whether I saw her pour it or not was irrelevant. You do not respond to a customer with a comment like that and a tone of voice like that.  I actually do not remember her pouring it with everything that was going on at that time and maybe I would have if the bottle had been left with remainder of the Mum. After that encounter, cocktail server #18 became pretty condescending.  They did take it off the ticket which they should have because it either wasn't a Mum or it was a bad split bottle.  If I heard one of my employees talk to a customer like that, they would be dismissed or put on \"cleaning the wine glasses\" duty for a week.   Otherwise, the food was fine, the dinner server was great, and enjoyed being with colleagues and friends.",

The place has a unique look as well, with just a small portion of the building being exposed above ground. Walking in, I was immediately impressed with the maritime feel that the decor gives.  The food was good.  My date had the crispy grouper which was really good, and I had swordfish with mango salsa.  For me, the swordfish was good, but I felt like the mango salsa was a bit overwhelming and the entire plate could have used a little more.  We also had a shrimp cocktail appetizer - good - and a chocolate lava cake for dessert - this could have used some ice cream or something, but the waitress actually informed us that they dont have vanilla ice cream at all.   Overall dinner was very nice.  The prices are expensive, I'm sure this is primarily due to the cost of having fresh fish flown in daily.",

    "text": "This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.  We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.  We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.  The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.  While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.  So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.",

It had a strong odor of fish that punches you right in the nose the second that you head down the stairs.  That being said..this place is a one of the kind and absolutely worth visiting.  This is type of place that I would love to bring guest from out of town...a really neat and interesting restaurant experience.  The facility itself is well worn, interesting, and a bit eclectic.  The food was HIGH quality and very well prepared. We started with the Shrimp San Remo (which I read about on Yelp) and it was excellent.  I have never had anything  like it.  The sauce was even better on bread.  And the mushrooms...oh the mushrooms...oh how I loved thee.   I had the stuffed lobster and Ash had the King Crab.  Both were very well prepared and absolutely scrumptious.  The wait and bar staff were all super friendly and well versed on the menu (our waitress even cracked our lobster and crab for us.)  The service was great and they did a very good job of taking care of us.  I will say that being seated at 8:20 for our 7:30 reservations was frustrating and we met several other parties who had also been waiting nearly an hour.  It does make me wonder was this an off night...or why take reservations if you can't even come close to seating at the reserved time?  Overall...I would say you should try it.",

There's something retro about that, though the place itself does feel modern.  2) It's romantic, mostly because there are no windows and so it has very low light. It isn't noisy either - everyone there (when I went anyway) seemed to understand that the mood was low key.  3) The lobster is actually fresh. They did what they had to do to get fresh lobster to the restaurant the day I showed up to eat it. You do pay for that kind of freshness of course, but please believe me - this is ALWAYS better than eating rubbery, whiffy lobster. If you're going to eat lobster without leaving town, pay the extra for it or stay home.  It is a fabulous date restaurant. SO LEAVE YOUR KIDS AT HOME. The darkness and closed in feeling didn't work with the one that was there when I was, which was the one downside - a downside the restaurant had nothing to do with, of course.  Otherwise, perfect.",

During dinner they have reasonably priced wines (which is nice when you're dropping 40 bucks on a lobster). It also rocks that the place seems so small from above and it is always cool to impress guests that it is underground.. especially in the summer. The only drawback is the dining area seating, it is really cramped, so don't go expecting romantic secluded tables. Other reviewers have noted the high price, but you get what you pay for and where are they finding all this cheap seafood anyways?",

    "text": "This restaurant was horrible! I went there a few weeks ago with my husband and his parents for my husband's birthday. All of the seafood we had was overcooked: lobster, stuffed shrimp and grouper. I highly doubt that they fly their lobsters in from Maine daily. The vegetables were not fresh or seasonal and the baked potato had no substance. How do you screw up a baked potato??! I think the lighting is so dim because they do not want you to actually see the food on your plate. The dessert, chocolate lava cake, wasn't even good. I grew up on the east coast and love old fashioned seafood restaurants; however, there is no comparison. I couldn't even dent the food on my plate because the thought of eating it made me feel sick. There are too many amazing restaurants in Scottsdale to come here and pay for overpriced, not fresh seafood.",

Don't blink or you'll miss this buried treasure off Hayden in Scottsdale.   I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and I KNOW what good seafood should taste like...this is it!   So impressed with everything: the freshness of the food, the service, the ambiance. Sure it was pricey, but what the hell do you expect? We live in the effing desert, People! Only giant pig-rodents, tarantulas, and poisonous snakes (oh! and scorpions!) live here! If you want fresh fish you want to go to the place that makes you pay for the freshest stuff. Not, um, The Fort? Whose All-You-Can-Eat Crab legs can be seen being plucked from the ocean back on the 2005 season of Deadliest Catch.   Try the Shrimp San Remo.

We had reservations for 7:30 got right in.  Tables are WAY to close together!  For a fine dinning experience and the romance factor this was not ideal.  I got to hear all about what was going on whose check during the course of my neighbering table.  We order cocktails and to my surprise they came out in what I would call \"kids cups\" very tiny!  We ordered crab cakes for the appetizer.  In which I love crab however these had no flavor at all I didn't even finish it.  The salads we ok garden salad nothing special.  I did however like the tarragon dressing that was served.  For our Entrees my husband had a baked lobster to which he said was ok.  The Lobster meat was very sweet but again fell flat on the seasonings.  I had the King Crab legs and filet.  I loved the krab leg (just 1) but the steak was terrible so much so that I had it wrapped up to take home for the dogs.  For desert we had the chocolate lava cake.  I don't think it's prepared there seemed pre made.  The sauce was amazing though.  OK.. The service however was AMAZING!!  Our female waitress was always attentive, timing was good on all food delivery, she even went ahead and wrote congratulations on the desert plate at my request for our celebration (not something they usually do)  Atmasphere 2 1/2 Stars Food 1 1/2 Stars Service 5 Stars",

    "text": "The Salt Cellar has been a culinary landmark in the valley since I was just a kid, so I was aware of it's reputation.  I would definitely recommend it based on it's historical significance; however, if you're looking for great all-around seafood experience, you may want to consider some of the other notable seafood restaurants around the valley.  The atmosphere is cool - in that, the dining area is located underground, making it dimly lit, and the theme is old nautical.  (Although, I did feel slightly claustrophobic once we were seated and had to quickly down some wine to relax that panic.)  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and we didn't really have to wait long to be served our drinks or meals.  We ordered the Monk Fish, Crab Cakes, Baked-Stuffed Lobster, and the Salmon.  Everything was tasty and fresh, but the flavors were definitely in line with traditional Seafood dishes.  Not that this is a bad thing - I guess I have just become more comfortable with seafood dishes that have something extra regarding flavor.  I'm glad that I had the experience - hopefully the Salt Cellar has another 30 years left in it, but if I have the taste for seafood again I probably won't go back.",

There's little besides seafood, and no sole, calamari steak, walleye, catfish, or finnan haddie, but what they have is excellent.  Anybody should be able to find a seafood they like among lobster, salmon, trout, swordfish, crab, scallops, shrimp, ahi, and sea bass.  Sound a little ordinary? If you wonder what really sets them apart, aside from a cozy underground location, try the salmon wellington or the fried oysters.    Food prices are a bit high for regular dining, but the wine list is a bargain, and unlike some fancy places uptown they don't charge extra for a salad or vegetables.",

I mentioned my food allergies and the server was very accommodating. I enjoyed the Alaskan Halibut and my wife enjoyed the King Salmon Oscar she ordered. both were cooked excellently.  My only minor complaints are that it was a bit noisy as it is a \"cellar\" type room, very enclosed. The pricing was a bit high as well, but we really enjoyed our meals so it wasn't a big deal.

The service was crude and charged us for a dish they forgot and made us wait just to get it Togo. Way to own up to your mistake. We wanted to go to a bit nicer place since it is our Anniversary and were completely disappointed. For the money we spent we could of had bought all that seafood and prepared it better myself and paid for some personal entertainment for the evening. Lessened learned we will not be returning. Unfortunately we had to learn this tasteless lesson on such a special night. I must add before I end that my husband broke out in red spots and fever an hour after eating at The Salt Cellar. I'm most certain this was just a coincidental allergy after talking to a doctor giving him Benadryl. He felt better after taking the medicine but we both grew up on seafood in the Northwest and he has never experienced anything like that after eating seafood. The only dish he ate that I refused to was the steamed muscles because they were so small and over cooked but maybe they were just poor quality. I know I have high standards after just now getting out of the food industry after culinary school and ten years in restaurants, BUT this is the first time I have felt strongly enough to write a yelp review in hopes of warning someone who was also thinking of trying The Salt Cellar for the first time to just not. Maybe if the service was a amazing I would not have been inspired to write my first review but it was just was bad as the food. I just give up. Good seafood does not happen in the desert. Sigh.",

The Shrimp Cocktail was perfect. 5 large shrimp, freezing cold with a zingy sauce. I had the Shrimp San Remo entree and it was to die for. An abundance of shrimp in a perfectly seasoned garlic sauce, with pasta, fresh parmesean, and an artichoke heart on top. I took home a large amount. They are very generous with portion size. Key Lime pie for dessert; not too tangy & not to sweet. Every bite of food at this place was a taste of heaven. My husband had the scallops and said they were tasty and cooked perfectly as well.   My compliments to the chef. Scott G. took care of us and he provided very high quality service. This is a perfect place for a special dinner or just a night out treating yourself to an excellent meal. Dinner is not cheap, but worth every penny. Best seafood in the valley in my opinion.

My husband and I went here for our anniversary, Walking in it seemed like a unique place with a unique atmosphere. I could not have been more wrong.  When we were seated in the dining room we immediately noticed the dated decor. The yellow lights, and brass picture frames with pastel ocean scenes. It was like they haven't changed a thing since the 80's.We were berated by three different people asking us for our drink order when we first sat down, which was not only confusing but annoying.   when looking at the menu we noticed there was nothing under 40$ which is fine I will gladly pay for an AMAZING meal. I ordered the fillet and Alaskan King Crab legs...I am going to emphasize legs here. My husband not being a seafood fan ordered the 14oz boneless Rib eye. Now where to start, Our meals came with salad, vegetable of the day, and your choice of a baked potato or rice pilaf. First the salad was Iceberg lettuce but despite that their house dressing was still decent. Now onto the meal Our plates came out and I was SHOCKED and HORRIFIED, My 40 dollar meal consisted of a child's fist sized baked potato, which incidently was the best part of the meal, a pile of vegetables, zucchini, cauliflower, and black olives...yeah think about that for a minute, they where BOILED no seasoning and inedible. My fillet was tiny which was fine I was not expecting a huge hunk of meat, cooked perfectly but had NO seasoning and tasted awful. What a waste for that cow that sacrificed his life to be cooked in this place. Last but certainly not least my Alaskan King Crab leg... yeah that is right ONE leg. When she sat my plate down I just started laughing I could not believe I just wasted 40 on this. The server said wow that's a leg as if I was getting some deal. My husbands meal had the same problems no seasoning and boiled vegetables. Give me a break this place is a joke! I have never payed 100.00 drinks not included for food that was so terrible. I have no clue how this place is in business and I will scream it to the mountain tops DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY... Unless of course you like bland inedible food. Go to Red Lobster you'll have a better meal at less money. And that's saying a lot, I try not to eat at chains...",

Highly disappointed with the food for the price, the salad was very sloppy the food was plated poorly honestly i have had better presentation at chilis.  Maybe my expectations are to high but at almost 50-100 a person I want good service and food I am excited to eat, the only reason I ate my food was simply I was starving.  We didn't even ask about dessert after the main meal was so disappointing will not be going back, waiter told me that the shrimp scampi was best shrimp dish on menu it was flavorless and my shrimp were floating in about 1 cup of butter the shrimp toast was so hard you couldn't eat it, waited years to try this place and disappointed that I did.",

    "text": "My experience at Salt Cellar located in Scottsdale. I loved the ambience.  This is an old underground restaurant which is beautiful.  A little crowded and congested but still a nice cozy place.  The food and presentation however was disgraceful.  For an overall review of what we ordered and the quality of the food is as follows; Halibut Ceviche $16 - A little too tangy then what I was expecting, the dish was served in a pretty cup, however the oyster crackers were served in a souffle paper cup (the same as the paper cups that you find at McDonalds for ketchup) - that was a $16 dish.  I ordered the Charcoal Broiled Georges Bank Sea Scallops $40; now this dish was prepared excellently.  The scallops were sweet and melted in your mouth - an A+ for sure.  My wife ordered the Cajun Style Blackened Atlantic Halibut $44, the chef that created this meal, took blackened to a whole different level.  The fish looked burnt more than blackened... the fish literally crumbled - it was that dry.  I took the leftovers home, and the first words that came out of my 13 year old daughter's mouth was 'wow this is dry'.  Both dishes were served with a salad, steamed carrots and a baked potato.  The salad was extremely generic with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, and crotons with dressing.  The baked potato was cooked fine.  The carrots however were difficult to cut with a knife.  I like a little crunch in my vegetables but these carrots didn't seem to have seen much steam.  Overall, we went in with high hopes and came back deflated.  Personally, will not be going back here again.",

    "text": "I heard about this mystic underground seafood restaurant by chance and I made a mental note of it. My roommate picked up on it when I explained, as best I could, that this place is essentially a parking lot with a restaurant underneath it. And apparently, the seafood is to die for. So when the next special occasion arose (my birthday), my roommate and I made plans to travel to this netherworld of seafood delicacies and subterranean mystery.  The experience was better than I could've imagined. First, there was a small crowd waiting for the place to open. Seating is limited, so it can fill up pretty fast. But this added to the adventure feeling, as if we were all on some sort of marine odyssey and we had to gather at the gangplank. We descended into the rustic interior along with the other guests, and then bellied up to the bar to have some appetite-enhancing cocktails before our reservation time. The bar is pretty cool and has a great selection of mixed drinks... I may have to return just for their Happy Hour sometime, and scarf down what looked like a great menu of seafood appetizers.  When it was our turn to enter The Abyss, rather, the dining room, we were prepared. We had done our research and watched a clip from the local PBS show \"Check, Please! Arizona\" where the reviewers drooled as they described the sauteed shrimp San Remo appetizer. We had to have it! We made sure to indulge in the fresh baked bread in thick-sliced hunks, perfect for sopping up this most heavenly, buttery, garlicky, tomatoey sauce. This is truly a magnificent, superstar dish that I still dream about (despite the buttery stains that soaked through my napkin onto my dress slacks)! This appetizer is so delicious, that I had no problem eating it AND wearing it.  My entree was also quite special. I ordered the mahi mahi (with macadamia nuts), which came with wild rice pilaf and sauteed veggies. I expected this to look like Trout Almondine, with slivered almonds atop. However, the macadamia nuts are actually part of a toothsome, applesauce-like topping which confused me greatly. The sauce definitely has the crushed nuts, but the flavor is a bit sweet and reminiscent of ginger-bread spices. It wasn't until I was several bites deep and I squeezed all of my lemon on the fish, that I understand the genius of the flavors. The lemon really opens it up and lets you experience the delicate texture and savory character of the fish accented with gingery and nutty notes from the sauce. Truly a novel approach to what might otherwise be dismissed as just another white fish dish.  Alas, we had a fabulous time at the Salt Cellar. We even got along famously with the couple at the table next to us who were celebrating an anniversary. It seems that the novelty of the underground location and the fabulous food makes for a real treat! I consider my meal here one of my most unique and unforgettable dining experiences.",

There aren't many seafood restaurants in the Phoenix area and I've always been curious about this underground place.  First impression was this place looks like going to my grandma's house for dinner.  The decor was old, smelled musty, and it was dark as hell.  I thought the food here must be phenomenal to carry its other shortcomings.  I was wrong.  EVERYTHING was overcooked.  Calamari, halibut cheeks, ahi tuna all overcooked!  Why would you overcook Ahi?!  You don't have to worry about food poisoning from undercooked seafood here.  Clams were steamed so it was hard to overcook but they didn't use any seasoning.  I could have cooked that at home.  Looking around it seemed like the only people who still come here and think this place is good are the senior citizens.  We were the youngest ones eating there on the saturday night.  I'll end this review on the positive note.  The carrot cake was good.",

Everyone at our table enjoyed their entrees and the portions were all generous.  In our case the service was really really really slow at the start.  We had a reservation, so they knew we were coming but once we were seated they acted like were were invisible.  We had to ask for water, which  at the onset sets the tone for what is ahead, and is very off putting.  They had plenty of waitstaff so we couldn't understand what the problem was.  You hardly saw the same person twice.  Finally the waiter came and he could tell I personally was annoyed.  He tried to step it up for the rest of the meal and it did work out.  At these prices, no one should have to wait 15 minutes for water and have to ask for it.  But I will give them 4 stars. But again only based on the quality of the food.  Interesting ambiance.  It's some kind of old salt cellar underground, so if you have fobias about being buried alive, this isn't the place for you. :)",

Which makes zero sense but I appreciate the sentiment.  The decor is cool, you are underground but the place is clearly dated which I will overlook for now.  I'm banking at this point on the seafood being extraordinary, the underground gimmick can't possibly be what's keeping people coming back all these years... right  NOPE, the food is mediocre at best.  I mean I'm not a sea food snob and I live in a land locked state BUT sand is never ok in your scallops.  My lady had some shrimp deal and was equally as enthused with the blandness.  Again the restaurant is pretty cool decor wise, the waitress and their sidekick cocktail server took care of us incredibly well.  BUT you can get better fish at a chain restaurant.  So maybe go for a drink, feel like your on a boat in 1971 then go somewhere...anywhere else for a delicious dinner!",

Its a little further from my home area, but a must go to.",

    "text": "We went to the Salt Cellar for the first time tonight. We had reservations and got right in. Kind of cool that it's in the ground but the decor is old and dated. The menu looked good and there were many things we were interested in. We got the New England Clam Chowder and we both liked it. We both decided on the scallops and the salad that came with it was good, I had the tarragon dressing and I thought it was tasty.  Dinner came and that's when things changed. The plate looked rather sad. Broccoli and cauliflower smothered in some white sauce. Neither had any flavor. The scallops were cooked well but had no flavor to them. We don't mind spending money on a decent meal but this was not one of them. Not worth the price at all.   We decided to try to finish off on a good note and ordered the Creme Brulee for desert. Once again, no flavor. It was a big ramekin of custard that needed something to make it special.  Service was average. We sat down and two seconds later we had someone asking to take our drink order. We hadn't even looked at the wine list at all. Maybe we're just used to a certain level of service at a higher price point restaurant but it just seemed rushed and not what we hoped for.  I'm sure there are people that go to the Salt Cellar and love the food and service but it was just not our experience. Disappointed to spend $180+ on a less than average dinner and not have a good experience.",

I have alot of fond memories of this place, but it seems like the more I come the more inconsistent food has become, as well as service.  Every time my honey and I come in, the two of us always spend about $200+, without drinks. That just shows how much of fattys we are. We always order the fried oyster meal as an appetizer, and they were always BIG FAT JUICY oysters, but the last three times we've gone, they have been maybe the size of quarters and only 5-6 of them.   I asked our server the last time we went if the oysters go by pieces or ounces and she said ounces, so I told her we have been getting skimmed then and she said sometimes the chefs get busy and just \"give you whatever.\" NEAT!  Then the last two times we went, they didn't have anymore 3lb lobsters for the stuffed lobster so that was a bummer...   Oh and DO NOT get the stuffed Jalapenos.. A SERVER TOLD US THEY WERE BIG AND DELICIOUS... mehhh my three year old could make better ones..   Service is subpar at most nowadays, and definitely not attentive. I literally watched bussers, maybe servers clear off a whole table, while that table went to the bathroom, then the server for that table freaked out and yelled at them for clearing it when customers were still eating. LOL!",

The staff as a whole were very attentive without being overbearing.  Classic seafood fare is on the menu. I had the Ahi and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Get the couscous as your side- it might be the best couscous I've ever had. I wasn't inspired by the side salad or the veggie sides, but they were fine.  You're given your choice of free desert for your birthday, which was lovely. We had the amaretto cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake and they were both excellent. We took home a lot of leftovers, too.  The lighting is dim and the tables are classically set up. It's a very traditional date-or-special-occasion ambiance. My grandparents have gone for their anniversary and my grandma's birthday for the past five or six years and although I'm more of an adventurer, I understand the appeal.",

Anyways,,   Nothing in the reviews or my past experience, recommended per RESERVATION Only,,, well, tough when you \"didn't\" know and thus, our only option was to sit at the bar and only allowed to enjoy Beverages and appetizers.. So, what the Heck.. Lets make the best of it !! Cheers..   Oysters, ... Only option was Blue Point Oysters.. Which normally are the \"higher\" priced ones at most other seafood places... I personally like Gulf coast better, but thats another story... Well, the oysters lacked flavor, and you can Taste the tap water they are rinsed off with... almost NO saltiness.. definitly not impressed..   New England Clam Chowder. This was actually very good, and not thickened up with corn starch, so you could taste all the ingredients, which tasted very fresh.. this Kept the rating at 3 Stars..   Improve on hospitality, and maybe some verbiage at the door related to a dress code, and maybe reservation \"required\" unless i was just super lucky and couldn't even get a table..",

    "text": "Went in on a Thursday night with a group of about 20 people for our holiday work dinner. The restaurant itself is very unique. I love that it's a very small building at glance but when you first walk through the door you go down a wide rustic wooden staircase and the restaurant is located completely underground. Unforuntiley there is no elevator so keep that in mind. It's a medium size restaurant with 2 small rooms and a large bar. You can hang out in the bar area while waiting to be seated.   The servers were good! We had 2-3 servers for our large party and additional food/drink runners periodically. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgable of the menu and any questions we had. We were seated at 2 large tables and one of the tables got their food and finished eating before the other table got their food which was a bummer. We had ordered at the same time too. I know it was a large party but that should have never happened. Luckily with the appetizers, bread, and salad we were patient enough to wait for the meal without starving. Not sure if there was a mix up in the kitchen but the servers never addressed that.  There is a ton of menu options for everyone to enjoy. So even if you don't like seafood there was many other great options such as steak and teriyaki chicken. It is a bit pricey but i feel it's fair to the service, portion, and quality food you are served.   *** All lobster and crab options are cracked and cut open table-side which is awesome. So don't fear the pain of cracking those crab legs because they do all the work for you!! ***  Each entree is served with bread rolls to start, salad, veggies, and baked potato or daily starch. They had some interesting salad dressings to choose from. I went with the tarragon dressing. Honestly, I hated it but it was because it tasted like mayo to me. But that could be totally a personal preference so I just set it aside because I knew I had plenty of other food coming!   Food I got: - Appetizer shrimp cocktail was delicious. Served with 5 huge jumbo shrimp and a flavorful spicy cocktail sauce. - Surf and turf with 1.5lb lobster and 7oz filet mignon. It was all incredible. They serve the lobster with a lemon butter that was delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly. Had a great char flavor.   Overall I was satisfied aside from the huge delay in food being sent out. I may come back and sit in the bar for happy hour food so that might be a good way to go for a cheaper route.",

    "text": "Salt Cellar is a hidden gem for the Valley locals. The building itself is humble on the outside and magical on the inside. My dad has lived in Tempe most his life, so I was introduced to the restaurant at an early age. After entering, you'll follow the staircase down to the bar and restaurant area. It's an intimate space but not cramped. Low lighting and ambient music make for the perfect setting for a romantic date or even a buzzed family dinner (my choice).  The servers and bartenders are as attentive and considerate as can be. They are friendly and thoughtful, offer genuine suggestions and never let you go without whatever you may need. The menu includes fresh Maine lobster, other seafoods, and specialty beef selections. The wine and spirit selection is always more than adequate. The food quality can't be beat, especially for a seafood restaurant in Arizona.  If you haven't been to the Salt Cellar yet, make a reservation soon. It's a beautiful little hole in the wall that will become an instant favorite.",

The lobster... nope!!! We both ordered the live Maine lobster (steamed). I honestly have to say that the tail was the worst lobster I have ever had. It was tough, stringy, chewy, and we were not able to finish it. Wanting not to ruin the good vibes of the night, we got the remainder of our food to go. I must say that the last time we dined at the establishment I had the best lobster tail I have ever enjoyed in the state of Arizona, so I know how good the food usually is. Both of our lobsters were over cooked and ruined. When I told our server that we couldn't eat the lobster and asked why it was so bad, she asked the manager and the response was, \"the tail is tougher because it's the muscle that has to work hard\". I eat seafood nearly everyday and lobster frequently... seriously, that's their answer for the terrible food.",

    "text": "Whoaaaa, I can't believe I haven't reviewed Salt Cellar yet! Well, let me rectify that immediately!  BACKGROUND   I remember when the Salt Cellar was THE place to go for dinner when you had a date.  Although there are now all sorts of nouveaux chic pop-ups that are stealing the limelight, Salt Cellar maintains itself as a decent place to get some tasty seafood.  SALT CELLAR  Salt Cellar was established in 1971, and continues to reign atop the \"Best Of Seafood\" lists.   Owners Richard and Cindy Huie follow the business philosophy that consistency, quality, equitable pricing and great service are the key to success.  The culinary adventure begins with its unique underground location.   One peek through the ground-level skylight reveals a world far removed from the desert; take the antique wooden stairway down 3 flights and you will find yourself transported to a snug seaside hideaway.  Salt Cellar's fresh fish and seafood selections will take you around the world; from Hawaii, Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, Boston, Georges Bank and even New Zealand.   The Salt Cellar is known for always having available a selection of whole Maine lobster; 1lb, 3lb, and 5lb.   The extensive menu abounds with choices that will surely satisfy every craving.    In addition to the year-round and seasonal fresh fish, the Salt Cellar serves choice Black Angus steaks, a chicken entree and even beef Wellington.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   As I mentioned, I've been going to Salt Cellar for years.  On our last couple occasions, we went for family birthday gatherings. Their dining room is PERFECT for a bigger, yet intimate, setting.  I had the oysters on the half, which were large in cup size AND meat size, and DELICIOUS. I also had the fresh mussels in drawn butter broth, which were FANTASTIC.   I get the fresh lobster every time.  They have the fresh lobsters in a tank, so you can actually see what you're getting.  I even indulged in one of their specialty dessert cakes, which I didn't share with anyone, even though they offered several forks.  I had them make me a tasty girly drink of amaretto, orange juice, grenadine, and a ton of cherries.  The service is usually exceptional, although Tim got a little snippy at the end, making comments about who he had to listen to, and who was \"paying the bill.\" Ohhh Tim, big faux pas to discuss the bill AND insult the restaurant picker of the family, but whatever, I'm obnoxious, so I'll take the blame ;)  CONCLUSION   Salt Cellar is an oldie but goodie. I'm still a fan and will keep coming back.  4/5 RECOMMEND   *Plenty of parking out front.  *Difficult stairway for some to manage.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsaltcellarrestaurant.com&s=d72619c51f29f6ecf6fd01041793bcc15c9261fd933f676da69053e592ea7002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">saltcellarrestaurant.com</a>",

    "text": "This was such a great meal! I went with my best friend who also loves seafood. We had the half dozen oysters on the half shell and the turtle soup to start. The raw oysters are an old favorite, while the turtle soup is definitely a new one. It was served with a slice of lime and a shot of cooking sherry to be added to taste. The mixed basket of bread on the table was perfect for dipping into the dark flavorful soup (my favorite was the olive bread), and the soup was gone quickly. The turtle meat had been completely removed from the turtle and shredded. It had the consistency of shredded pork, but just a little different. If you've never had it, I highly recommend trying it.  Not only because it's delicious, but because it's always good to step out of your food comfort zone, especially for something so tasty. I promise you will be licking the little bits of turtle meat off of the spoon :-)  For the main courses we ordered the swordfish with mango salsa and the pound and a half of king crab legs. The mango salsa was a great contrast to the seared swordfish. It was also perfectly cooked and not too dry, which, in my limited experience, seems to be difficult with swordfish.  The swordfish also came with a salad, steamed veggies and either a baked potato or rice.  Now to finish this off with the best part: the crab legs were amazing! The server asked us if we wanted him to crack them and after saying yes, he dazzled us with his wicked awesome crab leg cracking skills. Every piece was ready to be eaten, and only very little use of the very small fork given, was needed.  On a side note, king crab is the way to go if you have the choice. the smaller opilio crab doesn't ever really give you a good sized bite of crab, but king crab is all big juicy bites of meaty crab goodness.  The Salt Cellar was a dimly lit cozy environment.  The walk down the stairs into the cellar should have been a warning that we were going to have to climb out of there, which may have limited out excessive food intake :-) there was a cocktail lounge if you just want to have a beverage, and two dining rooms which have great beach and ocean landscape pictures on the walls.  The staff was very friendly, and so were the live lobsters in the giant tank as you walk in. This is a great place to take a friend or a rather impressive place for a first date.  Just make sure that he/she likes seafood.",

    "text": "I started going to Salt Cellar years about ten years ago. It has been my favorite restaurant in Arizona. It is disappointing to see all of the bad reviews on here, because my experience has always been great. The king crab legs are my favorite thing on the menu, besides the shrimp San Remo appetizer which is a must have! I will say, the prices have increased dramatically, so I have not been back in quite some time for dinner. I always start at the bar, and then sit down for dinner. I would go more often and sit at the bar for a drink, appetizer and salad, but you are not allowed to order salad in the bar area. Lou was our favorite bartender for years, and unfortunately he is no longer there. The last time I went, the new bartender was very rude to the people who I was with. I felt embarrassed because they were unhappy with the service, after I just talked the place up. I am guessing over time the inviting atmosphere has changed, and attendtion to detail along with great service has been replaced with making money.",

Order it, eat it, dip bread into the sauce, take it home and marry it.  It is unreal, and they will not tell me what it's made of.  Share with someone as it is VERY rich.  Other highlights from the happy hour:  -Shrimp cocktail w/killer cocktail sauce (very strong horseradish heat). -Bucket o mussels or clams -Clam chowder (more broth-ey than thick) -Great crabcake -Stuffed clams -The oysters rockefeller are excellent  I mainly go for happy hour, but when having dinner here with the folks, it has always been excellent.   The bartenders are awesome and friendly, make strong drinks, and have been working here for years.  That tells you something right there.    I really think some of the reviewers before me were a bit harsh.  Best seafood in the valley, and a LOCAL business.",

    "text": "I read other Yelp reviews before coming here and ordered accordingly: Shrimp San Remo and Stuffed Lobster. Both are very good. Shrimp San Remo is in a buttery, garlicky herb-filled broth with a slightly spicy aftertaste. The shrimp are average-sized - not too big, definetly not too small, and surround large chunks of portabella mushroom.  Filet mignon came out cooked to perfection and King crab legs are enormous and cracked tableside by your server, as are lobster claws.  The lobster is stuffed with a bread mix that contains king crab and scallops. The scallops are whole and a little over an inch in diameter. I counted two. I felt that the stuffing was a little over-the-top as it detracted from the lobster itself, which IMO should be the star of the plate. But that doesn't mean it wasn't good and I would recommend it to anyone going to The Salt Cellar for the first time, I just might not order it next time.  Some other Yelp reviews mentioned a \"musty\" smell - I didn't notice this at all. As in, there was no smell.  We had a five-star experience with excellent food paired with top-notch service with genuine smiles and friendliness all around. However, I have to dock a star for veggies and bread. They'll charge you a couple of bucks extra for bread to go with the shrimp, which I found odd as clearly, you need something to sop up all that tasty flavor. And the steamed veggies on the plate (zucchini, cauliflower, carrots) were obviously from a pre-cut frozen bag. The dinner salad was bagged, too - the iceberg blend that Dole carries, right down to the skinny carrot slivers. I mean, this is kind of a high-end place, so I wasn't digging that at all.",

Ordered the whole lobster for dinner. Was a little tough, but still tasty.  Downside: A bit smelly! I suspect because of the underground nature of the restaurant there is not a ton of ventilation, so there was a very strong fishy smell.  Definitely will go there again.

    "text": "Last night my boyfriend and I went to the Salt Cellar. It was both of our first times. Upon being seated, we ordered a bottle of wine. At that time, we also had a few questions regarding the menu. Our cocktail server informed us she would not be able to help. After our server opened our wine, she also told me to wait another few minutes before we could begin asking. Our entire dining experience was this way. Our server was snappy and had zero personality. We asked if she would mind taking a photo of us. Both came out blurry and with her finger in the photo. It was apparent we were not a priority and she did not want to be around us. However, considering the restaurant had few tables I don't understand why. She quickly moved us through each course, even asking to take my boyfriends plate as he was eating. When our main dish arrived (blackened halibut, and stuffed lobster) it was Delicious but once again she attempted to speed us through that as well. I'm not sure as to why, considering the restaurant had two more hours left until closing. By the time our meal was completed and we were finishing our wine 4 different people asked if we were finished drinking. It was obvious we were slowly sipping our wine and chatting. However, one lady even asked if we wanted another bottle before we were close to done with the first. Our bill was nearly $200.00. We were not cheap customers in the slightest. My boyfriend still tipped this woman 20 percent which she clearly did not deserve. On the way out the door the host asked how was your meal. We answered \"okay\" and she said, \"alright goodnight\". Salt Cellar only gets two stars because their food was delicious. Their service on the other hand was majorly lacking. I pray no one gets our grumpy server.",

    "text": "OK, went here because a gal I work with says it is her favorite place in Scottsdale and I got a Groupon sooo...  I actually loved the atmosphere, as other posters state it is underground and dated.  Which, being from the Midwest, reminded me of the \"supper Clubs\" we used to go to with my parents (Midwesterners, you know what I'm talking about).  Dark-ish, cozy, unusual seating patterns.  For those complaining about the price, they must still be thinnking in Midwestern terms because $39 for a lobster in Scottsdale is not overpriced (anywhere else yes, but Scottsdale seems to jack up the price on everything).  OK, onto the food, we started with cocktails in the bar which were just meh... average.  We got in late but the place was still hopping even on a Thursday night.  Skipped the apps and went straight for the entrees.  Again reminded of a supper club in that you didn't have to order everything ala carte.  All entrees came with salad, vegetable and starch - nice!  I ordered the Halibut cheeks with lemon caper sauce and Hubs ordered the Shrimp Scampi with extra garlic.  I could smell his dish being cooked before it was brought to the table, but he claims he couldn't taste the garlic (he is kind of a garlic freak, so a normal person would have said it was loaded).  Cooked nicely with lots of shrimp but nothing special.  The shrimp toast that came with it however was awesome!  I would have ordered this as an entree.  My halibut cheeks were good if a little on the tough side, not so bad but just a little.  They were breaded and pan fried and served with Lemon and capers which was yummy.  Here's the kicker, they gave my like 10 cheeks!  That's alot of Halibut cheeks, normally you'd get like 3-4.  So I took a bunch home and made luxurious fish tacos with the leftovers.  So overall a nice experience, good seafood especially for Scottsdale where it is actually hard to find really good food in general, especially hard to find good seafood.  It's no San Francisco or Seattle or Boston, but I would go back and try again.",

It's not very often you can find a place that has been sooo consistent for soooo many years. In a place like Scottsdale that has more choices to dine out than most cities in the U.S., the Salt Cellar is still a \"gem.\" For some of the reviewers, my only advice is: Have some fun, lighten up, and stop your pissing and moaning...This place is where the people in the business for a loooong time go to celebrate the milestones in their lives!",

    "text": "We had been wanting to try the Salt Cellar for years, having heard good word of mouth and mostly positive reviews.  We wanted to like it.  We really really did, but our experience was less than stellar.  We started in the bar for happy hour.  This was, for the most part, the highlight of our evening.  The happy hour food is reasonably priced.  The same can't be said for the tiny overpriced drinks.  Obviously what you save in food cost is made up on the drinks.  We had raw oysters, raw clam, halibut ceviche, and the shrimp san remo, which is a signature dish of the Salt Cellar.  the oysters, at $1.50 each, were a bargain.  Plump, briny and with just enough \"chew\" to give them substance.  Served with an average cocktail sauce and lemon wedges, it seemed we were off to a good start.  Same for the ceviche (I believe it was about $8.00).  Bathed in a flavorful lime juice, the moist fresh chopped halibut was ensconced in a bed of chopped onion tomato and herbs.  Again, delicious and refreshing.  Just 'ok' was the Shrimp San Remo (about $12.00).  Eight medium shrimp in a spicy sauce which also included portabello mushroom pieces.  While tasty with just enough spice to keep it interesting, the sauce was a bit overly oily.  Our waitress brought us a basket of bread and the oiliness didn't stop us from sopping up the tasty sauce.  Although my stomach did not appreciate the grease later!  Now the bad.  The clams ($1.50 each) had gone south.  They had a rancidness to them that was very off putting. We brought it to our waitress' attention and she offered to exchange them for oysters, which was ok, but when we got our bill, we had been charged for the extra oysters.  Not a huge deal, but when you drop almost $90.00 just for happy hour, it would have been nice if the oysters had been comped or at least offer to buy us a drink.   On to the dining room.  First, the whole restaurant is in need of a major decor remodel.  Not saying change the charming theme, but get the mustiness out and update the upholstery, carpet and tacky pictures on the walls.  Just freshen it a bit.  then whole decor harkened back to those rotten clams.  The wait staff is professional enough, nothing particularly outstanding, but capable and attentive without being a perpetual shadow.  I ordered the scallops in crab/shrimp cream sauce (about $35.00)and my date ordered the stuffed lobster (about $45.00).  Both came with an average mixed dinner salad and a bread basket.  When my dish came, I was a little surprised  to see that there was no accompaniment, just the n\\entree.  No veggie, which would have been fine if the dish wasn't so miserly on the scallops.  Only four lonely, medium sized scallops floating in a soupy pink \"sauce\".  The sauce had a faint taste of fishy cream and little other flavor. It had shreds of crab meat that seemed out of a can and those tiny little shrimp that have no flavor whatsoever.  The scallops were overcooked so they were rubbery.   The aforementioned cream sauce added nothing to the dish and the mound of white rice in the middle of it all only served as a reminder as to the minuteness of the actual seafood in this dish.  Not at all a bargain for the cost.  My companions dish didn't fare much better.  The lobster was decent size but grossly over cooked.  The soggy vegetable accompanying it had no flavor, and the stuffing was dry and flavorless as well.  There was a nice surprise of about three scallops in the stuffing.  Perhaps they had crawled off my dish to keep warm, which would account for the amount I received.  She also elected the lemon rice.  Perhaps a bloodhound could detect a faint whiff of  lemon, but we sure couldn't.    The Salt Cellar clientele seem to be a bit on the older side, which might account for the lack of seasonings, or perhaps they think the seafood can speak for itself. Well, if the seafood was fresher and cooked properly, perhaps that would be ok.  But given the circumstances, it NEEDED A FLAVOR INJECTION!  If this were a medium or lower priced seafood restaurant, I could give them a pass, but I dropped over $240.00 between the happy hour, dinner and tips and in no way was what we were served worth that.  they charge high-end restaurant, premium seafood prices but deliver sub-par food and just ok service.  It's apparent that there are quite a few people that like this place and are repeat customers.  We won't be counted amongst them, although we might consider coming again for happy hour",

My husband made reservations for us online for dinner,for my birthday. Online they ask my husband if we where celebrating any special occasion, my husband told them that we where celebrating my birthday. During our entire dining experience they made NO mention of my birthday to us. (Why even ask the question when we made the reservation)!!!   Our table was so small &  cramped,  to the point that we could hear everything the table next to us was talking about!  There was a candle on our table but I couldn't hear any music which really took a lot from the experience!! not romantic at all. I had a $40 entry (blackened halibut), which is my favorite fish. I was so disappointed  it was very dry &  certainly not a at  $40 entry. My husband had the salmon which had little flavor.   However our crab cakes (appetizer) was great. OuR server walked by our table 2 times, finally on the 3rd trip by,  he finally  offered to pick up our plates!!!  This was our first visit and last. Our dining experience was certainly not a good value ($160 which included  gratuity) wow!!",

    "text": "Went for first time based on all the positive reviews for my birthday  on June 30th....very disappointed. Started with steamed clams, very dry with no juice or broth in the bottom of the kettle, so they were kind of bland and rubbery. My wife had the halibut and it was overcooked and dry. When we told our server he offered to bring some lemon butter sauce.....how about offering to take it back and have it prepared correctly. Only after insisting for a replacement did he take it back. After removing the empty bread plate, never offered to bring us more bread. I had the king crab which was good,  shared it with my wife so she could eat with me while we waited for he entree to come back. Our waiter passed by the table several times while our water glasses sat empty. He eventually refilled them after clearing the plates from the table....a little late at the point. The cocktail waitress passed by and saw our sparkling waters were empty and brought us new ones. It would have been nicer to have refills during our meal. In my opinion, though I'm sure the quality of their raw ingredients are good, both the prep and the service were lacking. I've had moister seafood at Red Lobster. Think I will stick with restaurants of the caliber of Morton's for my future celebrations.",

So when we started making plans for our anniversary dinner we searched restaurants in the area and read rave reviews about it here. Our server, I believe his name was Scott, was amazing!! I'd give it a 5 star for him alone....oh and the carrots! We asked for the raspberry chipotle sauce on the side, minus the bacon. The wellington I had before didn't have a sauce...it didn't need it. This wellington was the blandest piece of meat I've ever had...great cut of meat but it was like it was boiled in just water and the pastry on my husbands wellington was soggy. The carrots on the plate were the star of the plate. Best carrots ever!! But I didn't pay $44 a plate for the carrots, though! I was very disappointed! So sad!",

    "text": "Seafood At Its FINEST | Hidden Treasure in the Desert  Salt Cellar is my go-to birthday restaurant. I can't say enough about the cool temperature, due to the cellar being underground, that the restaurant is housed in which looks deceiving from the outside -- until you enter and walk down a flight of earthy stairs and a friendly staff. I have tried a few appetizers at Happy Hour at their stunning bar with great HH deals - try the shrimp they are incredible!   I have tried blackened Chilean Sea Bass that was absolutely STUNNING for a dinner entree.  However, my heart lies with the Alaskan King Crab legs that are becoming more and more difficult to find at many dining establishment, let alone at a great quality. Market price 1 and 1/2 pounds of the BEST king crab I've ever experienced is well worth it - maybe $60 or so. This comes with a side (I had pilaf), and their famous broccoli with a beautiful cheese on top (forgot what kind!). Also bread of a few varieties, a gorgeous restaurant to tour, live lobsters to watch, and wine and drink prices that are really not expensive for such a high-end restaurant. They even crack your crab for you at the table!   Such a special place, location, history in the area, and with 5-Star Staff, from barbacks to servers to managers I give this place all of the praise in the WORLD! You have to check it out - seafood lovers a MUST!!!!",

    "text": "Kind of disappointing really.  I may have come in to this one with too high of expectations.  After hearing about how good the salt cellar was I was really looking forward to trying it out.  A good weekend came around and off we went.    The room we sat in kind of looked like a down on its luck red lobster.  Yes it's underground so I wouldn't expect a view but it was just dark....I think I was expecting it to be brick or stone.  It was just dry wall with pictures of ships that looked like they could have been used at a red roof inn in cape cod.  Hey maybe they are antiques but they were pretty mass produced looking.  Service was alright, but they definitely cater to an older crowd.    Manhattan clam chowder- wicked good Turtle soup- sort of a gimmick, nothing special...I wanted to like it but it was sort of like a jambalaya sauce with turtle, which could have easily been shredded chicken.  You'd almost have to do a DNA test to be sure.  But hey it's different so good for that at least. Swordfish- not served hot, not just the fish but the rice was also not warm...I don't know maybe older people like food to not be too hot, but I was really just disappointed. Filet-nothing super amazing, it's a seafood place so I don't expect the beef to be the best so I would give them a walk on this one.  Bottom line: just disappointed.  I was really expecting this place to be epic...it turned out to almost be an expensive Golden Corral.",

Away from the busy streets of old town and mill but close enough to venture there before or after. Plenty of parking.  Style: This restaurant has a classy speakeasy feel but casual attire is fine. The restaurant is open until 12am and the bar open until 1am. It's hard to find someone serving \"upscale\" food  past 10pm so we were excited to check this place out.  Now for the very unfortunate part.  The food: Wow, just the worst value ever. We ordered Shrimp Cocktail, 2 glasses of champagne, market bay scallops and lobster stuffed shrimp.   First we got the bread and champagne. Everything was going great. The bread came in huge slices and was fresh. It didn't come out warm but it was still fresh and tasty. It was served with a whipped butter. I prefer oil myself but it was good. The champagne was great.  Then we got our shrimp. It had that refrigerator taste to it. Like it was made earlier in the day and then wrapped in plastic and thrown in the fridge. We could both taste it. It wasn't the worst shrimp ever and we did eat all 5 jumbo shrimp but we were a little turned off already.   Then we got our salad. We got the house vinaigrette as a dressing. Salad was fine. Lettuce was fresh. It was presented poorly though. I'm not usually a stickler on presentation but if you're charging $40-50 a plate I figured some effort was coming. It looked like a diner salad and for some reason they give you a huge heap of mushrooms on the side. Whatever, salad is a salad. We were still optimistic about this place. It was so cool and classy and close to home that we wanted to love it. Still no real complaints.  Then the dinner came. Ew man. Ew. My Scallops were flavorless. I was expecting big scallops seared and delicious. Instead, I got these miniature flavorless scallops served with a side of broccoli covered in some type of sour cream sauce. And this weird seasoned lemon as a garnish. The presentation was horrendous. It looked like a dish you get from a Mexican restaurant. As soon as we were served we gave each other that, \"what the hell is this\" look.  Her dinner was just as bad. Her stuffed shrimp had shells in it. She literally took one bite and didn't want to eat anymore. I tried to eat a few more pieces of the scallops but it was not good. The sides were even worse.  We dropped $115 plus $20 tip. We frequent nice restaurants and have no problem spending on good food. Check our review history. Take my word for it or be disappointed, the value for this place is simply not there.",

So, he had to eat cold lobster. (I told him about 15 times to please eat. I would just pick off of his plate.) I felt horrible - it was an easy mistake by the server.

I felt like I was entering a Disneyland ride when I walked into the restaurant, and when we got to our table felt like I was actually at the ocean.  That is hard to do in the desert!    Not only was the atmosphere so cool and out of the ordinary, but the food was wonderful. We started with calamari which was pretty average, but the crab cakes were out of this world. And I cannot even begin to talk about how great my stuffed lobster tail was (and how huge!!) I ate more than I should have but I couldn't bear to leave anything on the plate.  We went at about 8 o'clock on a Friday night, our service was great and I think that was in part to it being peers empty,  we almost had the entire room to ourselves, but we did still make reservations.   I would definitely go back here, it's a bit pricey but worth every penny for that kind of seafood in this kind of desert!",

I have been patronizing this place since the mid 80's and still remember the late night drum solo's off the bottles behind the bar. It was always late in the evening and sometime symbolized last call. I think it was about 12:30 back then.  The bar has always been my favorite spot, and throughout the years has always been a very friendly place, with bartenders who knew how to serve when needed and be a buddy when that is needed too. These bartenders have never shied away from conversation, and I dont believe have ever forgotten a fork.  Clam Chowder, Shrimp San Remo and Sourdough with butter has always been my favorite meal, but in the dining rooms they serve up great fresh lobster and Jumbo king crab, and they are always happy to crack the shells at the table for you. A list of about a dozen fresh fish await your purview as you come down the stairs.  Service is top notch, yet friendly and casual enough. It never seems rushed or inattentive, and sadly that is becoming more of the norm, even at nicer places.  It's not inexpensive but the value is there so dont be afraid to enter and descend to one of the most hospitable dining spots in The Valley.",

So, though my previous experience about 6 years ago prevented me from heading in, mom's dyer need to eat the soft shells brought me back in a few times in the past couple of months.   The previous basement feel that I got from the place has definitely been resolved. I mean, it's still a basement but the stagnancy that I felt in the past has subsided significantly.   I am also a bit bummed that they have like no veggie options for those who don't chow down on the critters. I mean, sure you can likely request any of their side veggie options but they're not listed anywhere on the menu and are limited I'm sure (baked potato, side salad, carrots, asparagus, whatever side options they have on hand).   So, that's a bummer but they're a seafood joint, not a vegetarian place.   They also have their cocktail waitresses visiting in addition to the server. Last trip we had there, the cocktail server came by first while we proceeded to wait for a good 20 minutes before catching her and requesting for water and our server. My mom isn't the most patient and I was doing my best to protect them all from her not having water or an appetizer.   I did a good job holding her down and they brought a server by. We did have reservations and we did still wait a few minutes to be seated. Granted it was dinner time and they were busy.   I'm likely to be invited to dinner with her again, I may suggest we reserve either before or after \"the rush\" to avoid any tantrums on our end.",

Salt Cellar was recommended to me by an Uber driver and I decided to take her there since she loves seafood.  I had to convince her to go because she had always been wary about ordering seafood in the dessert.   Once we arrived, we were impressed by the many delicious-sounding choices on the menu.  We had the shrimp cocktail and softshell crab as appetizers and both ended up with the scallop-stuffed lobster for our entree.  The food was exceptional, cooked to perfection and very fresh.  We were very impressed with both the food and service at the Salt Cellar.  The ambiance is very romantic and would actually be an excellent spot for a special date. I have very high expectations for food, especially seafood, and highly recommend the Salt Cellar.  Best restaurant in Scottsdale!",

    "text": "The Salt Cellar is close to home and I have heard phrases like \"you have to go\" or \"best seafood in Arizona\"  Driving by, I said let's try something new.   Upon taking the plunge into the basement restaurant/bar, I was filled with excitement and energy. Restaurants in Phoenix are all above ground and the Salt Cellar has a reputation as a chic underground/undercover business.   It turned sour quickly.   The service is mediocre and the food follows suit.   I had mussels, escargot, a glass of meiomi and a hopknot and the tab was 50+ with tip.   Ultimately the value did not feel substantiated and the crowd was generally 60+   Generally I enjoy a mixed crowd and the clientele seemed stuffy and old.   I'm sure this business was all the rave in 1990-2000 but if you want a seafood place that stays with the times you are better served going to High Tide in Gilbert or Ocean 44 in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I've always been wanting to try this place, being that it is an underground restaurant and bar seems really interesting to me. Made a reservation for Sunday night got there around 4:30 the bar was already full ,dinner reservations were at 5 . Great service as well as cocktail service. Food was good I had Alaskan King crab which was very fresh, a baked  potato and vegetables ,not too many options when it came to sides those  were only them. This 2nd entree was the lobster stuffed with scallops and crab meat with the same sides since there was no other option. The stuffing was very good but the lobster Was Disappointing and tough , didn't eat it all just really chewy!  I ordered the creme brulee for dessert but that wasn't cooked all the way. For the price we paid for the lobster I did complain to our server who volunteered to give us a free dessert but then decided to take the lobster off our bill which I appreciated ,we had no leftovers to take home and was quite expensive for what you got but that being said it was a very interesting place to have a underground restaurant that's been there 50 years . It's an interesting place to go and try but I'm not running back there anytime soon, I think if anything Id go to the happy hour at the bar but you'd have to get there when they open at 4. For the money spent you could do a lot better at Hillstone restaurant or at ocean club maestros ... but also something to experience I think if they would just do better sides and options with more flavors like Mastro's or Hillstone they definitely be getting five stars.",

From the moment you park you are simply amazed at how many people could fit into such a tiny little structure. Until you walk in and realize that everything is underground. Side note: Prior to walking in there are windows that look right into the bar. The concept and design work is well done all around shows why it has been successful and around as long as it has.  Bar area: Serves an awesome happy hour menu from 4 PM to 7 PM and 10 PM to 12 AM every day. Also has a wide range of liquor for you to choose from. You can sit here while you wait for your table.  Dining area: Limited sitting makes it feel special, there are a few high top booth areas that look like that spot to be as they look over the rest of the dining area. Sitting makes you feel close to those around you but it is not that bad at all. You will have a cocktail waitress to bring you drinks and ensure that you are topped off and your waitress to ensure that you are satisfied with the food or need assistance making decisions.  Food: Bread was brought to the table to start. The rye bread was not up my alley but that is more of a preferential thing. We ordered the bucket of mussels as an appetizer and were not disappointed at all, comes with drawn butter & an additional sauce that was also good. Once we were finally able to limit our options on main dishes from the phenomenal menu selection I went with the King Crab and she ordered the Baked Stuffed Lobster. The main dishes come with a choice of a baked potato or couscous, salad with your choice of dressing, and Chef's daily starch, which was broccoli & cauliflower topped with Gouda. I ordered my starch without Gouda because I do not like cheese, however it was brought to the table. Not a big issue because I brought it to the waitresses attention and she brought a side order. The vegetables were cold all around. Aside from that everything else was great from the combination of dressings on the salad that the waitress suggested to the table side service as they deshell the lobster and crab. The taste of the Baked Stuffed Lobster and King Crab was money. For dessert, we ordered a salted caramel gelato that had Ghirardelli chocolate inside. Thing was to die for, only $8.  Overall, great place. Definitely going back to get in on the Happy Hour and see what that is about. Be prepared for a bill between $150-$200 for two people. It is an experience that you will enjoy though and more than likely want to partake in again.",

Loved the atmosphere.  Food .. oysters Rockefeller were a B.. good not great. San Remo shrimp was a B great sauce. Bucket of mussels & clams were really not good. Though they looked great the mussels tasted weird & I could not eat. The clams were better if you didn't mind gritty sand left behind in your mouth. Poppers were so hot one could not eat. All in all spending well over $100 can not justify. Unfortunately I feel that people lower their standards when it comes to great seafood here that is reasonably priced. I did not find anything very expensive but really was expecting quality to be a lot better.  Super ambiance... !!",

I could not stop eating, my buckle was undone. It was my best friends birthday so we decided to go somewhere delicious, but let me tell ya we did not know this place would make Gordon Ramsay cry buttery seafood tears of joy (I'm sure he would).

We made reservations for 7 and upon arrival we were told to wait in the bar area but there wasn't any real direction on where and how we would be notified when our table was ready. The bar area is not huge so I didn't think it was a big deal and we ordered some drinks. 15-20 mins go by and we still have not been seated. I am starting to get annoyed because if I make reservations I don't expect to wait. The husband tells me to be a bit more patient. Ok, fine I will comply. Now 30-40 mins have gone by. My patience has run out now so I ask the waitress who was taking our drinks to check on our table. She comes back and tells us that they had a mix up and that someone took our reservations but they are reseating that couple. So finally we are seated 40-45 mins after our reservation time.   Now comes time to order and my husband and I both order lobster and I was highly disappointed when my lobster and sides came out. The overall flavor just didn't do it for me. The decor and the place just seems like it has seen better days. This probably would have been a very nice romantic spot back in the day but now with all the food options it just seems run down.",

I ordered the lemon caper halibut and took half of it and some vegetables home. Later that evening I went to heat up the leftovers only to find a maggot in it. Awesome. Now I wonder how many maggots I ate while at the restaurant?  Can't do it .    9/30: Before I could even respond to the message from The Salt Cellar through my Yelp account I received this on Facebook. I feel not only is this completely disrespectful but this establishment doesn't give any care into making a situation right or taking care of a customer. Disappointing to say the least. The maggot looking worm came out of the vegetables. I'm well aware of your seafood practices and the care that is taken, which is why I frequented the restaurant.  Definitely never going back now and moving forward. This is not okay.   Let me just add the MULTIPLE times that I did not receive an appetizer or side of crab legs that we ordered, and there is always an excuse rather than an apology...and yet I forgave and returned to the restaurant. Unbelievable",

We planned on having appetizers at the bar but the bartender Daniel was so rude we moved to a table so we could be served by someone who would actually take our order. We typically start with the San Remo . Unfortunately the chef must have quit and taken the recipe with him because this was not the San Remo I used to dream about. It tasted like it was swimming in Tabasco sauce ,the shrimp were tiny and overcooked. The shrimp cocktail was so bad we had to send it back. Even the server said she wasn't sure what the stringy things were hanging off the shrimp???  We should have run for the door at this point but we were starving and couldn't imagine that every item we ordered would be so lackluster and void of flavor. The Salt Cellar is expensive and with all the new restaurants opening that actually care about the quality of food they prepare and offer excellent service we intend to spend our hard earned money elsewhere. Goodbye Salt Cellar it was a good run while it lasted.",

The halibut cheeks had no flavor and tasted like cardboard.  The rice pilaf tasted like Uncle Ben's and the veggies were way over cooked and cold.  No redeeming value for anything on the plate.  Save your time AND money... It's not worth the walk downstairs.",

There was more of a thin, overcooked layer on top of the lobster than being stuffed... It was so thin and dry that it was hard to taste any of the seafood in the stuffing.  It is served still in the lobster, my personal preference is to be served the lobster as a filet out of it's shell.  Overall, it was rather tough, dry and flavorless.  The sides were unimpressive.  For the price, I believe there are better restaurants to go to.",

    "text": "We go to The Salt Cellar about 15x/year. For cooked seafood in Arizona, this is as good as it gets.   The bar offers a nice variety of single-malt scotch, cognac, and even a few armagnacs. One of the bartenders, Dale, knows his spirits well and has a knack for remembering his customers. The drink prices are also quite reasonable.   The bread baskets are generously full and pair well with every sauce on the menu. We're partial to the bread with kalamata olives baked in, because seriously, they're kalamata olives! No further explanation required. :)  We've enjoyed the following dishes:  - Scallop in cream sauce with crab/shrimp (Perfect dish, esp. with the bread.) - Halibut cheeks (Rich and delicious.) - Filet Mignon (This isn't a steakhouse, but they still do a pretty good job on this one.) - Salmon Wellington (Try as you might, you simply cannot eat it all.)  Ultimately, we find our way back to the scallops with cream sauce. It's our favorite dish, and it never fails to amaze.  We always enjoy top-notch service, food, and spirits in this restaurant. What a blessing to live a mile from there! :)  NOISE-SENSITIVE DINERS: When making your reservation, find out if large parties are seated at the same time or in the same room as your table. Noise is a problem as this restaurant is underground and the walls reflect everything. Try to book during off-peak hours if you can. We love this place, but we love it because we eat outside of peak hours.   ^^^ Parents with screaming children, or children with screaming parents: Take note and book your reservations during happy hour. :-)  SUV DRIVERS: The parking lot is small and offers little maneuverability; especially during happy hour. Parking on the side street is your best bet for a smooth exit.",

Out of this world seafood- che.....errr, sorry Salt Cellar, as much as I wanted to love and was excited to try you, you left some to be desired.  At the suggestions of many close friends whose taste i'm usually aligned with, I decided this would be my \"special occassion\" pick for my bf's bday. The allure of this place is certainly that its uniquely underground and not a chain. You feel as if you are going on a fun, mini trek while heading downstairs to the dining area. Certainly had no probs with the past reviewers comments on noise levels or stuffy air. Salt Cellar is quite small, with limited, close-together seating and a surprisingly stocked bar which houses a great Happy hr I hear. I would suggest asking for a reservation on the \"raised\" corner booths if I were to return.  The hostess was extremely helpful when I snuck away to order my bf a complimentary bday dessert (you can choose any of the menus offerings) and our waitress was one of the best servers I've had in a long time. Not only did she help us by extensively describing dishes, but she continually checked up on us. We were shocked at the cheap prices of the wine-by-the glasses, yet it all made sense when she brought over some of the smallest glasses that should be allowed to be qualified as wine glases.   Entrees are served with bread, a dinner salad and veggies, and our main course came out lightning fast (is this always a good thing? i think not) I went with the Australian Barramundi w/ Spicy Avocado Vinaigrette ($35), a white fish the waitress desc. as similar to a halibut. And I gotta say, I thought the point of paying extra $ in AZ for seafood was bc its flown in fresh weekly....but holy moly fishy flavor. I wouldn't regard this as a great catch. We were told diners always had a prob with the oily vinaigrette that would separate atop the fish, so they began serving it on the side. This sauce is quite a strong, but good flavor.  My bf ordered one of the more pricier dishes on the menu - Baked Stuffed Lobster. The stuffing of scallops and crabmeat was ehhh and the overall size of this meal was lacking (altho. we couldve upgraded). The one thing I liked was that you could add an affordable side-order of King Crab Legs to any meal...This dish was certainly better than the Barramundi.  Lastly, our flourless choco cake was below par. The consistency almost was as if it was undercooked, and needed a fruit or raspberry sauce to offset its taste. I am curious to try their Kahlua topped, Banana gelato wafer...  Overall, I did enjoy my experience here. Will I be comin back for more and ravin to all my friends about it? Naw. But I can't hate on you Salt Celler, afterall, we are in AZ :)",

I'm used to good New England chowder after having spent several years on the east coast.  Heck, even Legal Seafoods has better chowda and it's a chain.  The crab cakes were totally overpriced for what they serve and not that great either.  I've had better and cheaper crab cakes from Costco.  Seriously, this place is overpriced for what you get.  I'd say go to Capital Grille or some such place if you want an expensive meal that also tastes good.    Sorry!  I don't get it!",

It all looks and feels like the inside of a ship and its surprisingly a very nice feeling.  We had the crab cakes for an appetizer and then the stuffed lobster and the king crab legs.  Everything was very good.    Crab Cakes - They were great.  Not huge but great.  Almost no breading so tons of crab and a very nice dipping sauce that I can't recall.  Stuffed Lobster - Nicely sized lobster with all of the meat intact (sometimes I feel that places replace some of the meat with the stuffing to use the meat elsewhere).  The stuffing was very good but seemed like a lot of breading.  Very nice dish though.  King Crab Legs - These were great.  Very fresh.  No saltiness, fishiness, or hint of freezer burn that you get many times with king crab legs.  Quite a nice touch that the waitress cracks all of the shells for you tableside and even leaves all the kunckle meat easily accessible.  All the legs were an ok size but not huge.  They were cooked perfectly though.  Overall I would say great seafood and a menu with tons of variety and fresh items.  It was a little over priced though.  Pretty much every dish was at least $30 and most were high $30s.  Not obnoxiously expensive but a little much.",

People are right when they say you can smell seafood as soon as you enter, but it kind of added to the ambiance in a nostalgic, strange way. I sat in the bar, and the bar does not serve the full menu. I was fine with that, since I only wanted an appetizer and a glass or two of wine.  The Appetizer I wanted was the infamous shrimp san remo. I was intrigued with it after seeing it on their website, then people raved about it here. All my expectations were met, it is truly decadent with a sauce that bounds with flavor. The bread is a perfect accompaniment to dip in the san remo, especially the ciabatta, which was excellent.  They have a good wine list, I started with a chardonnay, the Diamond T, which pairs perfectly with seafood - a little pricey at $12.50 a glass, but apparently it can range to up to $100 a bottle, so actually a great deal. The best chardonnay I've had in a long time! I also had the David Bruce pinot noir, which was well balanced with a pleasant array of berry notes, yet still quaffable, and a great way to close the evening.  I only gave it 4 stars because I have yet to try an entree, which I will since I will definitely return. Go just for the san remo and treat yourself.",

I actually crave the house dressing they have!!!  My favorite is the crab and scallop stuffed lobster.  It is so tasty!  Love the atmosphere, it's where we go for special dates.  The wait staff cracks your crab legs and lobster for you - that rocks.  At the end of the meal they bring you warmed moist lemon towels to take the sea food smell off of your hands.  The only negative:  they charge for refills of sodas.  Order water instead.",

It has been a couple of years since we've been there so I can't say how the place is now but the seafood tasted fresh and the service was good (though not great).  With tax and tip, we spent a good $150 there and I think only ordered one drink.  The restuarant itself is kind of neat.  You go there and all you see is a parking lot with a door and three walls.  The restaurant is actually underground.  I think it's worth going for special occassions, especially since it's so hard to find good seafood places in the valley, IMO.",

While semi-exensive, the atmosphere is not too fancy or over the top, in fact it is classy and quaint. After reading other reviews, I saw that I should order the baked stuffed lobster and am I happy i did. It is one of their signature dishes and they do it right, it is very similar to lobster thermidor minus the heavy sauce. My wife had some turtle soup which was unique and tasty. (don't worry animal lovers, it was snapping turtle they used!)  FOr seafood in AZ, you need to visit Salt Cellar and view their wide array of fresh fish. Great wine selection too including local vino. Can't beat the experience and our waitress was over the top and spot on.",

    "text": "I hate to give such an iconic restaurant as The Salt Cellar 3 stars but I think I have too.. I'm basing this on the main entrees and pricing. The appetizers were delicious and the service was exceptional. That could have been due to the fact that the place was pretty dead for a Friday night.. But nevertheless our server, I think her name was Destiny(?) She was very very good and recommended we try the Sauteed shrimp San Remo, SO GOOD!. We also got a bucket of steamed clams and some calamari.  My main issue was with the average tasting, overly priced entrees. My food was tasty, I got the Scallops with King crab & Atlantic Baby Shrimp sauce. Our server gave an excellent description of what to expect when the food came and I'm glad she did because what I got was not what I expected, but like I said, it was OK. My boyfriend and his sister were not particularly please with their entree choices either.  I think the moral of the story is, unless you have a TON of money to drop on lobster (I'm guessing that's what they're known for) just go to enjoy the ambiance, have some wine and appetizers. You will still have a pretty heavy ticket at the end of the night but it will be a much better experience.",

Going downstairs into this little basement takes you away from the external heat and desert setting and into a small restaurant with candles and wood interior. Great little atmosphere.  The bread was out quickly before dinner and our server was excellent and quick to refill water or bring another glass of wine. I had the crispy grouper and that was very solid...fairly light, good-sized portion. We also had the scallops and they were good. But the highlight of the meal was without a doubt the Shrimp San Remo...large shrimp in olive oil, garlic, sundried tomatoes...bread to dip into the delicious concoction...simply amazing.  One thing to note, Salt Cellar is not cheap...average plate is roughly $30-40...so not a cheap nite out. But for good food, and a great atmosphere (anniversary, date nite, birthday, etc), this is a good call.",

We looked on yelp to see what people recommended and the Shrimp San Remo was definitely worth a try! We also got the fresh bread to dip in the sauce! YUM!

My Dad was looking forward to King Crab Legs... they were $50! He went for a steak. We all ordered oysters, and in two dozen got 3 bad ones. ugh! ever had a bad oyster? It's almost enough to cure you... I know, what do you expect in the desert when ordering seafood??  I don't know... Maybe a fair price for fresh food???

We walked in on a Saturday night in October to find they had an hour long wait. The bar was wide open, so we decided to go that route instead. We were informed when we sat down that we could only order appetizers and the bar. This to me was very disappointing. I decided to try and keep an open mind anyway. I ordered the Shrimp San Remo, which came highly recommended on here and thought it was delicious. The sauce was definitely the main attraction. The shrimp were a little on the small side and it only came with six, so I asked if I could get a little side salad of some sorts. Nope, only appetizers at the bar. No salads either. WTH?!?! My boyfriend ordered the mussels appetizer and said they tasted like the mussels you buy at Fry's down the street. So unfortunately, my first experience was not so good. I would be willing to try it again if I am able to order off the full menu. Not being able to order the full menu at the bar when the place isn't that busy is ridiculous in my opinion!",

The beer was served in a bottle and, as usual, overpriced.  A glance at the menu revealed some VERY expensive dinners.  I was SHOCKED to see that these prices were twice what Carlsbad Tavern or Richardson's was.   However, it was kind of neat to see this one \"old school\" patron choose his LOBSTER out of the tank.  The timid hostess grabbed the LOBSTER with a net and scurried back the the kitchen was a look of \"ewwww\" on her face.   So, on a 10 scale, this place was about a 7 when I was hoping for a 9.

The soda's were flat and tasteless. The House salads were not prepared , they were just thrown together, The Fish, Swordfish was bland and had no flavor. The Rice was something from Lean Cuisine. My Halibut was under cooked and fishy tasting. The server never asked how our meal was. She was too interested in taking care of the local's who come there often and won't complain . They charged $38.95 per item, for what? DO NOT EAT HERE!! this place gives Scottsdale a bad name for quality restaurants.

All were cooked perfectly and enjoyed by all.  We shared everything and everyone was quite satisfied.

    "text": "Not being a fish person (so take that as you wish) my mother wanted to take my wife and I with my daughter here for dinner because she likes it (on Friday 6/10/2016). I found the whole experience to be very overpriced for the quality they deliver. Starting with the parking lot.  I started with the Turtle soup, being from Philadelphia, Snapper soup was a staple at a restaurant there. Although the Salt Cellar's soup lacked seasoning (and lazily puts the sherry on the side) I didn't think it was that bad. I'd give it a 3/5.  Salad dressings choices leave to be desired, and I can't eat mushrooms -- but the waiter never told us they had mushrooms and by the next time I saw him our entree was there.  I had the Beef Wellington, and so did my daughter. We both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings. The raspberry syrup they dump on it is absolutely awful. It totally killed the whole thing, but I suppose when they don't season it, that's what you should expect -- heavy syrups.  And definitely not Grade A cuts, nothing more than you can buy at a supermarket (for the lower grades)  My wife had the salmon which she said was okay, they spend more time in presentation than flavoring again.  The free desert they give us for our anniversary for chocolate cake seemed liked they found a  stale doughnut from a store and microwaved it with chocolate sauce. Good thing we didn't pay for that.  I'd say this place is overpriced by at least 200-300% given the quality. The staff is friendly, but the waiter doesn't get you drinks, some cocktail one does -- so be prepared to get everything different. The beer she refilled wasn't the same I had (nor did she ask) and she refilled my mom's Gin and Tonic with Sprite -- but charged us for a Gin and Tonic.  We didn't eat half the meal as the sides were barely edible - the kus was nothing but water and the broccoli and cauliflower had some sauce on it that made it taste and smell \"off\". The baked potato was microwaved and not even scrubbed.   Not one elicit response from the waiter, cocktail waitress, or even a manager to come up and ask what's wrong given that we barely ate 30% of the meal. I'm guessing they just bank on overpriced, completely under-quality food and hope that people still believe this is some type of \"place to be seen\" given its Scottsdale address.  I'd expect more from a place that averages about $60 a plate with tip and drinks -- you should also. Their management seems to have no issues with it.",

We had two glasses of wine, a martini, steamed clams, 12oz filet and 1 1/2 pound lobster that were both served with baked potatoes and house salads. Our check was just under $160 and thought that was a great price for everything we got. Our server was amazing. She's only been there for about a month and she did a fabulous job and was very knowledgeable. We are from New England, so getting the seafood we want out here is tough. This will absolutely be our go-to.",

    "text": "So I came here on a whim because it was a Sunday night and most places were already closed so my options were limited. I wanted something quick and they're open until 1:00 am, I had this place already bookmarked so I said \"why not?\" because at that point I was starving! It's located off the beaten path in the south east area of Scottsdale and when I approached the building I was confused because it looked like nothing was there!  When I walked in the door......wow what a surprise! It's LITERALLY a cellar lol! You walk down this really nice all wood staircase and wood walls/ceiling, dark with movie theater type lighting guiding the path and a chandelier to top it off of course! I finally got to the bottom where I saw a guy and asked \"am I in the right place?\" because I didn't notice the sign saying where the heck I was! He laughed and said yes. I asked if I could get something to go and he said I could but I wanted the crab cakes with vegetables and I could only dine in to get it. I said why not it'll be a quick bite so I agreed and followed another lady to my seat.  I got to the dining area and man! I was not expecting a 5 star type dining place! Dim lighting, relaxing music, setting the mood perfectly. Everyone was all dressed up and I walk in with a regular blouse and jeans, whatever. Hostess sits me down then I'm greeted by ANOTHER person who asks if I wanted some wine to start off with, me not being a wine connoisseur I nicely declined the offer but I took a water and told him I was ready to order. Didn't even look at the menu so honestly I didn't know price of the meal before I ordered! He started me off with some bread and a side salad, salad was amazing and a meal itself (bread not so much, a little too bland and dry)! I order crab cakes with vegetables and a baked potato, the wait for a simple order was kind of ridiculous in my opinion, or maybe I was just really hungry, but I think they could've brought it out sooner than they did.  I finally get my entree and the presentation was beautiful! Nicely plated, and they put a lemon cut open into a star shaped with some chile on top, awesome! Baked potato with just chives was pretty good, and the vegetables with a light cheese sauce was great! Saving the review for the crab cakes for last because.....this is where the 4 stars comes in. Crab cakes could have been much better in my opinion, I like crab cakes to have big chunks of crab and less breading. These crab cakes had a lot of crab, however it was shredded crab so the texture was really hard to get used to  because it was kind of mushy and just didn't taste as good as a chunky crab cake. The flavors were there however! All in all I enjoyed majority of my meal (just not the main item unfortunately). The price was a reasonable price for the service that I received, it would have gotten 5 stars if I enjoyed the crab cake as much as I enjoyed everything else and if it didn't take so long my for my food to arrive. I will come back but I will try something else next time.",

    "text": "First time visiting Salt Cellar in Scottsdale was last week for a work event. We made reservations way in advance. We were a party of 20+ and were sat at two different tables. It was made clear to the staff that this being a work dinner everyone was to pay for their own liquor and all food was to go on one bill. One of the tables was half way through their meal before the other table received their dinner and we ordered at the same time. When the bill came the staff literally separated each \"beverage\" order (1 coke, 3 teas, etc) so they had to redo the ticket. It was time consuming. The food in all honesty was marginal at best. For the price we could get a better/finer meal elsewhere. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "I've been eating at salt cellar for the past 15 plus years. Shrimp San Remo is my favorite dish. I was sad when they took it off the happy hour menu. Now they've switched bread. They use to have amazing bread. But now they have these dense tasteless rolls. It was a great night when I could go for happy hour and enjoy a beer and dip my bread in my San Remo and savor the goodness. Oh and they use to have the best bartenders. They would greet you with a smile and looked genuinely happy. I realize the service industry is stressful and hard on the feet. I believe my breaking point was reached when I went there on a slow Monday night and the bartender looked perturbed by our presence. I found myself apologizing to him that I had to order another drink and more appetizers. I believe it's the end of an era. Gone are the days of great service and food fit for kings for the older restaurants. They're are several places in Scottsdale that have popped up and are giving the Salt Cellar a run for its money. It makes me sad to see the place go down hill. Many good memories fill the place.",

    "text": "Keep on driving ... Mother of god. I almost got in a fight with my girlfriend trying to find parking because there was surprisingly a lot of people here so I suggested we park in the street. Right now after having dinner and several drinks at their happy hour I'm wishing that our fight would've landed us both incredibly angry at each other so we just went home because I would still have $85 in my pocket and not want to slit my wrist at the meal that I just had.   Let's start with oysters... everybody knows if you get an oyster that is at least a pound it's going to taste like everything that it's lived by for the last 37 years... minerals, human garbage, you get the idea. Let's talk about chowder - is that the red or the white? Both types of this classic mirage of seafood deliciousness always bring a smile to my face, but if you're going to serve something that is runny and wishing for more oyster crackers ( basically POW porridge that the Koreans wouldn't even serve ) I eat it so not to offend the nice bartender.   Next the crab cakes....or should I say loaf of bread that was soaked in clam juice... But the chef still had the sack to charge 15$.   I'll finish with the fish and chips...two decent size pieces of fish cooked relatively well, not too shabby. The texture of the fried fish was a bit soggy ..good color ..but a bit soggy.. The tartar sauce was surprisingly delicious as it made me forget about the sog. But the kicker to this dish was the chips... when you order fish and chips you expect nice potatoes, either in gaufrette form or traditional fries. Here at this particular establishment they served what I would like to call Chinese Stars, a chip so stale that if you threw it across the room you would decapitate seven people..... In short I would like everybody to know that guns don't kill people, Chinese Stars and stale chips do.   *disclaimer... Written by my boyfriend.... I'm not that funny",

Im pretty sure there is only one guy there who rules. He is bald and super friendly and hysterical- may be the only person who cares about his job. The price on the menu says of what management values in their linen white table cloths. Everything is swimming in a pool of butter. The only item that was remotely decent was the shrimp toast. I also did not get any wine suggestions and nobody steered me away from the very dry pinot blanc i was served. Call me crazy, but i didnt want to be lathered in butter and rolled up the stairs on the way out. The carrot cake looked tempting but after half-eating a plate i could recreate as an amateur for half the price i wasnt even going to order it.",

The stairs leading down stairs to the restaurant are very wide and lit up with rope lighting so you can see as you go down. Service was excellent. Servers were very attentive; filling water an brought as much bread as we wanted. Servers were very aware when they had to reach across the table saying excuse me pardon my reach. The table seating was adequate and very nicely setup. Tables were small, but not too close to other patrons. We had halibut, pan fried lobster and muscles. All tasted great and tasted fresh. Plates averaged apprx 34 to 44 dollars. Thats what it cost to fly in and eat fresh seafood in the desert.  Overall 4.5 stars as I prefer to be above ground. Service n food was 5 stars.",

They did bring fresh butter to the table upon request.  I asked for my salad dressing on the side but instead it came to the table, not only on it, but so much of it, it was like Elmer's glue.  The steamed broccoli was terrible and the sauce they put on it was awful similar to the Elmer's glue on the salad and so much of it.  Ickkkkk!

The tuna and the halibut were being heavily pushed. Four of us ordered halibut and one of us ordered the tuna. All four of us agreed that the halibut was gross. It looked malformed as if it wasn't even real fish and it was very dry. It also was very bland. The Cous cous was a mound of mushy pasta balls, not even really couscous. The bread was cold and dry. One of my friends told our waiter twice that she didn't like the fish. He ignored her both times and even asked her if she wanted to box it up. I guess he didn't hear what she was saying? None of us complained about the food but I hope to never be back to this restaurant again. Also I was in danger of walking to my car at night in this area because it's shady, there are barely any streetlights and there were two or three wayward looking homeless people milling about in the dark. The parking lot is too small to fit everyone's car. Oh and also, today I have a very upset stomach. Two thumbs down.",

The service was good- prompt order taking and delivery of beverages, etc. we had a recommendation for the calamari and it was probably the best I've ever had. It's not your average calamari- try it!   Overall our experience was only decent as the cocktail waitress was a little pushy on the beverages after we were already settled and enjoying ourselves. One member of the party had a halibut that was delivered dry and overdone and when the replacement came it was instead raw. Things happen, but this seemed sloppy to me coming from a place with such a great reputation for seafood.   I'll definitely come back again before deciding whether or not this place has my loyalty as a patron.",

    "text": "I have been to the Salt Cellar a few times before for happy hour but decided to come in for a nice sit down dinner with a friend and have the full experience.   When we walked down the stairs we were immediately greeted by the hostess who was very nice . Since we were a little early for our reservation, she suggested that we sit at the bar for a cocktail and appetizer since it was still happy hour.   Our cocktail server was very polite and promptly took our drink orders.  We decided to have the oysters on the half shell which were just delicious.  We sat at the bar with our drinks and appetizer for about 30 minutes when our server introduced herself and showed us to our table. We were able to transfer our tab from the bar to our table. We of course tipped our cocktail server because she took such good care of us.  Once at our table, our server went over the menu. We decided to order a bottle of wine because we were there for the whole experience.  She brought us and poured our wine and preceeded to tell us about the menu. One of the appetizers on the menu I have never tried before so we decided to order it. The oysters rockefeller,  oh my goodness, it was heaven in my mouth. I would go back just to eat 3 or 4 orders of it for dinner! I finally decided on having the stuffed crab for dinner.  My friend chose the scallops (which I have had before and they melt in your mouth).   Let me tell you about the lobster I had. It was stuffed with crab meat and scallops and I couldn't get enough of it! It was so good! Our server took the time to crack  the claws and I'm so glad she did because the meat inside of those claws was phenomenal.  It was fresh and cooked to perfection.  After the amazing dinner we had just experienced, our server asked if we were ready for desert. Now, I couldn't eat one more bite because I had consumed about 2 pounds of amazing, fresh and perfectly cooked food. She suggested after dinner drinks. Heck yeah! More drinks? Why not? So she and another server suggested a drink called Nuts and Berries. My friend and I decided that we would have that. Holy cow! It was probably the most amazing after dinner drink I ever had! I would love to know how you make it.   All in all i recommend this place to everyone. Between the fresh food, the intimate atmosphere and the wonderful and caring staff, I will definitely be back. The happy hour is amazing, the service is amazing and the food is amazing. Thank you Salt Cellar for an wonderful dining experience! I'll be back :)",

    "text": "I first ate at the Salt Cellar as a child with my parents.  I have a nice memory of having lobster.  It was fun to go to a restaurant underground, and at the time (in the 80's) it was considered a really fancy place to go.    So that was the 80's and unfortunately, Salt Cellar is stuck in the 80's.  It still was kinda cool going down the stairs to the restaurant, but it felt like the air wasn't clean.  Seemed dank.  The bar looked nice, but the lighting in the restaurant were those weird orange ones.  Mood lighting?  Seemed depressing and old.  The pictures on the wall looked like were the same ones that were there in the 70's.  This place needs a make over!!!  We were seated and they took my fiance's drink order.  He was very clear about no water in his old fashioned.  It was served with water.  He sent it back, and it came back the same way.  Finally he just ordered straight bourbon.   My fiance had oysters and I had halibut ceviche. The oysters were gritty. The ceviche had a very sour taste and was loaded with red peppers. I think they used lemon instead of lime.  I couldn't finish it. Nasty!  Main course I had the Salmon Oscar. The salmon was amazing, but it was ruined from being drowned in a very bad hollandaise. It tasted like glue. No lemon flavor. It was just bad!  I squeezed some lemon on it to try to fix it, but it was not working. Too much sauce and it was just awful!  My fiance ordered halibut cheeks that were pretty good, but the vegetables were so over cooked and drowned in butter. The baked potato was decent.   I felt sick from the nasty hollandaise so we got the check and left. Disappointing!  Salt Cellar is stuck in the past and in need of a makeover.  I was afraid of this, but went for nostalgic reasons.  Too bad. We won't be back!",

This is probably the prime reason why we don't judge a book by its cover, we would have really missed out. This place has to be one of the best kept secrets around. Like a delectable seafood Speak-Easy.   This is probably the best restaurant in the valley and that is no joke or exaggeration. There is a reason why this place has stood the test of time. I believe wholeheartedly that boils down (No Pun intended) to three things: Atmosphere, Food Quality, and Service.   I actually found this place just asking around at my local barber shop for a quality place to take my lady for a nice night out, and boy did I stumble on to a gold mind.  We had clam chowder and the sauteed Shrimp San Remo, and then as far as entree's go we did the Stuffed Lobster and she had the Salmon. Both we're mind blowing, I mean we're talking ridiculously fantastic. Kudos to the salt cellar.  I've also heard that Happy Hour here is super legit, buckets of clams and brews for days, We'll be back to try out HH.",

    "text": "Hello to all my fellow foodies :)  Here it is 2 years after my first experience and for some odd reason I chose to celebrate my birthday again at Salt Cellar.  I was really craving some seafood and at the time I forgotten just how poor the first experience was....so.... a group of us met at the tiny overcrowded bar area.  We were allowed to bring our appetizers to the table and still pay the \"happy hour\" prices... I though this was decent of them.  I was craving scallops and asked more than once if scallops were in season, as I know there are certain times of the year when such items are \"in season\" therefore providing a fresher delicacy.  The one thing I really enjoyed the last time was their bread... it was crusty and soft and absolutely delicious.  I was told the bread is the same as it always was....NOT!  Dont tell me what you think I want to hear!  The bread was NOTHING like it used to be....this time is was simply \"bread\"....nothing at all good or special about it.  After many appetizers, we were served our salad...again, nothing special..very basic, except for mine... I guess I got the birthday surprise... a long hair attached to a piece of lettuce! DISGUSTING...   I showed the waiter who was very professional about it and seemed almost embarassed.  The group of us tried several items.  I got the scallops...after being assured they are in season and very good... Why do I bother to ask, when I know they cant say something like \"oh no...dont go with the scallops, they are small and not really the time of year for them\" and you'll regret it!  These small morsels were overcooked and rubbery and lacked any flavor!  A couple people got surf and turf and the steak also lacked any flavor/seasoning and was not cooked to was was requested.  The lobster, I was told was o.k but nothing to rave about.  We experiemented with some shrimp toast which I really cant describe because I am not sure what it tasted like other than salty...couldnt not detect the shrimp taste.  I returned my scallops and after the hair and rubbery food had no desire to try anything else.  The owner had come over to the table and apologized for the \"series of events\", his excuse for the hair being that due to the ventilation system hair and partical will fly around... (which of course has to land somewhere...why not my salad)   They removed my scallops from the check....duhhhh any mediocore place would do the same.  I would like to give a special THANK YOU to our waiter.. my apologies for not remembering your name, but he was terrific!  Friendly, quick and when we needed him...he was around.  We got out of there with what I feel is a HIGH price to pay for such a distasteful experience.  When I got home and after hearing my friends give their critique of my choice of restaurant to celebrate at I was pretty unhappy!  I felt the owner, although a nice man, did not care enough about his customers to do something a little \"above and beyond\" to apologize for the experience and try to keep a customer.  I called the restaurant and spoke with the owner and told him I was very dissapointed and felt that he should have done something more than make excuses.. he kept apologizing and I assured him none of the 5 of us would every return to Salt Cellar.  He finally said he would like to do something for me and asked for my address.  Here it is a couple weeks later...not sure why he wanted my address...maybe he is gonna picket my house or send mean letters...who knows... he never did anything!  It is clear to see why his restaurant is not packed as it was years ago....You may have the repeat business from those who have been patronizing your establishment from back in the day when your food was actually good, or there were no other options for seafood...but guess what?  There are other options!  At this point in my review I usually suggest you go and try for yourself...but this time I am going to save you the time and money....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!  You will be glad you did.  As for the owner of Salt Cellar....apologies and excuses are simply words....Stand behind your restaurant...you should have wanted to prove to me that you do a better job than was we experienced.  You are cutting too many corners to save money and it is costing you your customers!  Your actions speak for themselves!  It used to be when you mention Salt Cellar people would ooohhh and ahhh...those days are gone, most of the people I mention it to have no idea what Salt Cellar is. That speaks VOLUMES!  And so I say... Bon Appetite'",

The ambiance was great, the concept of putting the restaurant underground is clever  The service was great, and I think the pricing was reasonable for the quality of the food.    I had the Alaskan King Crab with the filet.  A filet is a filet almost anywhere you go so it was good.  The crab was for sure above average.  My husband got the stuffed lobster tail with the filet and the stuffed lobster was the best I've ever tasted.   They gave us a free dessert b/c we were celebrating our anniversary so we ordered the amaretto cheesecake....ah-may-zing.  Expect to spend around $150 for the meal if you don't order an appetizer but for a nice dinner out it's worth every penny.  We'll return to the Salt Cellar for sure.",

    "text": "My hubby is obsessed with crab legs, so every year for his birthday I take him out to places I know he can order them. He is always down for Red Lobster, but ugh I'm not, so I searched for an alternative. We had been to Salt Cellar once before, but that was about 4 years ago, so I thought we should check it out again. I made reservations for Saturday at 8pm, but I let them know we were running 30 minutes late & they said that was totally fine because they were a bit backed up that night. We only had to wait about 10 minutes & our table was ready. The dining room is small, I'd guess there were only about 12 tables in there. We got an awkwardly placed table that faced everyone, & since it was up against a wall we had to sit side by side. It sucked but oh well, we were so late I was glad they still sat us! I do love how this place is underground, but the decor is so boring/dated!  I can't remember our server's name but he was very nice & checked on us often. For starters we got the bucket of steamed mussels with sides of plain butter & butter with herbs. This bucket seemed bottomless, I swear there were at least 50 mussels in there! One thing that bothered me about this app was that it smelled fishy to me, didn't taste fishy though so we didn't get sick, but still. The complimentary bread & whipped butter they brought out was pretty good. Onto our entrees; hubby got the king crab legs (1.5 lbs) & I got the baked stuffed lobster. Both meals came with a salad, veggies & rice or baked potato. They cracked his crab legs & my lobster at the table & then we dug in. Hubs loved his crab, the meat was fresh & sweet. My lobster was ok, the crab, scallops & bread stuffing were too much for me, I would just order a regular lobster in the future.   Total for one cocktail, an app & 2 entrees was about $130 (not including tip). While the food was pretty good & 4 star worthy, I felt it was overpriced & the place lacked any ambiance, so I think 3 stars is appropriate.",

    "text": "Ugggh. Where do I start.  My fiance and I were going out for my birthday. He said pick a nice place. I googled a few places in Scottsdale and decided on seafood versus pasta. That was my 1st mistake.   We arrived for our reservation and were immediately seated.  We were promptly greeted by our server and ordered our drinks. Right away I told the server that it was our 1st time there and that we drove from Surprise to Scottsdale just to try out their food.  I ordered the clam chowder as a starter.   Holy cow was this bad.  Progresso has better clam chowder. The chowder was super watery and was not hot at all. We then talked about the menu and I ordered the baked stuffed lobster.  She really didn't spend a lot of time with us, but that's because she was super busy, and I can appreciate that.  Anyways, the lobster came.  She asked if I wanted it cracked and I said yes. She literally cracked the lobster with her bare hands.  Is this normal?!!  But that wasn't my concern, my concern was the lobster was soooo disgusting. It was cold, chewy and had zero flavor. The stuffing was dry and tasted like a bad stove top box. The scallops inside the stuffing had no flavor and chewy. I didn't even taste the supposed crab in the mix.  My fiance tried it too and he said it was horrible so I know it wasn't just me.  She came back and asked how everything was and she could tell by the look on my face and offered a new dish. I went simple and got the grilled shrimp.  Which was pretty good. BUT I didn't drive 35 miles for some grilled shrimp. I was so disappointed.  She offered me my bday dessert and I got the lava cake.  Another disappointment. It was cold and nothing special.  I am super bummed I picked this place as there were so many other options. The server was very nice and I don't have anything bad to say about her. It was just the horrible food.  Red Lobster blows this place away.",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend here after he said he wanted Beef Wellington for his birthday and I was still too overtaken by Cabo's revenge on my system to make it myself. I had reservations already at Capital Grille, because I saw that Salt Cellar initially had a 3.5 yelp rating. I can honestly say, the Salt Cellar is a pure 5. Upon driving up to Salt Cellar, I was confused by its street 'look'. Its tiny as the restaurant is underground. Stairs, stairs down and we were greeted by a friendly hostess. We had deliberately gone to the Salt Cellar early, so that we could have some oysters on happy hour, (that runs 7 days!), and a couple of drinks prior to dinner. My boyfriend had the $1.50 happy hour Oyster Shooter. Not gonna lie, I was just, icked by that. He loved it though. A raw oyster in a shot glass with a very good cocktail/horseradishy sauce and topped with vodka. Its his birthday.. he can do what he wants! We ordered a app of Oysters Rockefeller. They weren't my favorite, but they were still very good. Some restaurants do rockefeller different and I tend to like mine with a little red sauce involved. At dinner, we started with a very good Emeritus Pinot and the Shrimp San Remo. The San Remo is a specialty here at Salt Cellar. Decent sized prawns in a garlic, wine, butter, sun dried tomatoe saute; capped with portabello slices. Very good. I think I craved that a day later! Katie, our waitress, was an awesome waiter. She knew her stuff and the menu like the back of her hand. Scott inquired about the Turtle Soup and she graciously  brought him a sample. Dinner was me having a large stuffed lobster tail. Stuffed with scallops and crab meat and baked with a panko breading. I paired it with a filet for $18 more. The Beef Wellington Scott had was melt in your mouth awesome. Needless to say we were full by the time we both had a few bites. The breads are divine. The service is impeccable. I love this place!",

    "text": "The Salt Cellar in Scottsdale, Arizona has been around for over thirty years but after our first (and last) visit I think its time has run out.  The only thing that has changed over the past thirty years are the charges on the wildly over priced  menu.  With $35.95 for a 1 1/4 lb. lobster, almost $39 for Atlantic Halibut and $34 for crab cakes, we expected superlative food. Instead we received dishes that ranged from OK to awful.   We started with Escargot on mushroom caps in garlic butter and New England clam chowder.  The clam chowder was a thin bland soup with a goodly supply of clams. The Escargot was chewy in a butter sauce with just a hint of garlic.    My Atlantic Halibut was fishy, dry and hard. After confirming my opinion with my table mates I sent it back. Overcooking Escargot and Halibut at a seafood restaurant should be considered fatal errors. My wife and granddaughter had Crab Cakes and Scallops which they judged just OK. Not good enough for almost $80.00 in (2) entrees. To the restaurant's credit, the Halibut was taken off my bill without asking.   The restaurant is literally in a cellar. As the air conditioner cycles, the environment alternates between clammy and freezing.    We had a cocktail waitress (I haven't seen one of those in many years) which is code for over-priced soft drinks in a small glass with no refills.   The Food Network has a show, Restaurant Impossible, in which the host,  Robert Irvine, visits failing restaurants and fixes their problems. If he visits the Salt Cellar his first stop should be the kitchen.",

Also that in addition to the steak, at the Salt Cellar you get two sides.  So \"you get better value, and better tasting food for the same price!\"  I like a good steak.  I picked the ribeye (one of my most favorite cuts), and waiting in anxious anticipation.  I had high expectations and was very excited.  My wife ordered the stuffed lobster, and we waited.  The atmosphere was nice.  The furniture could use updating, but everything was clean.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  When the food came it looked wonderful.  However, the steak was tough.  It tasted good, but it was very chewy.  While it looked to be cooked to my liking, I expected it to be easier to chew and swallow.  My wife was very pleased with her lobster.  She raved over it, and would probably give a 4-5 star review.  The service was the redeeming factor for the Salt Cellar.  But for that you'd be looking at 1-2 stars.",

    "text": "Good service, but below average food.   I'm not much of a seafood person, so when we go to seafood restaurants, I order some type of chicken or steak. At the Salt Cellar I ordered a rib eye steak. I know that you shouldn't go to a seafood restaurant and order anything other than seafood, but my steak was surprisingly bad. There was absolutely no seasoning on my steak... no salt... no pepper... no flavor.  If the kitchen can't prepare a decent steak, they shouldn't have it on the menu and it shouldn't be $40. Unfortunately, it made our experience a disappointment and we won't be back.",

The New England clam chowder was so watery.  It was a bowl of soup, definitely not chowder.  The escargots were tasteless.  The best dish for the night was the jumbo shrimp pasta.  Not much presentation but it was tasty.  I will not come back again.  It wasn't worth it.",

The server will crack everything for you and sometimes the claw is so large, they have to take it to the back so the chef can do it for them. But most of the time, they can crack it using their leg as the \"table\".  Amazing staff, always.  The hubs and I have been going here every year for our anniversary for the past 11 years and we have never, ever, ever been disappointed.  Trust me!",

Not sure if they are correctly preserving their wine though as we had at least one that wasn't \"right\".  Some of the fish is exquisitely fresh, but that is offset by some that is not and a lot of fish and shrimp are farm raised.  The lobsters in the tank were showing stress with tails out flat which is never a good sign.  Salads were pretty bad with just iceberg lettuce.  The broccoli was very undercooked (think chain saw).  Overall, not a good spot for foodies.",

    "text": "Alright, i come to this restaurant alot, at least once a month. Have not had really any bad experiences up until this last time. Our server was Dore. HORRIBLE service, she should not be working at this type of Restaurant. This place is pretty high class, good quality type seafood joint and you pay a pretty good amount for any entree you get. Normally when you get seated the cocktail waitress will ask if you need anything to drink...we had no one for 15 minutes even say a word to us after we were sat. Our server comes over and finally takes our order and the food comes out wrong for two of the people. Dore says you can just switch your sides and it will be okay and then walks away. We all just looked at each other and Dore walks away. She knew bringing the food out the entrees were not correct so 1st...why did she bring them out incorrect and not have them fixed 2nd...in a restaurant where you are paying $35-$55 an entree you do not tell a customer to switch sides and food.  NO, our entress never got corrected, we just ate what we had and made it work. It gets even better, we wanted to see the small menu that had the deserrt coffees and drinks in it. Dore tell us we dont really have one and i say to her yes you do we had it when we sat down. Doesnt bring it to us, just lists them off, so i go and get up to get the menu myself. There were a ton of smallet things that happened throughout our dinner experience that were very unecessary. Im not sure i will be back or bring anyone here for sometime. The place was not busy by any means, as we got there before the late night dinner rush. Christmas Eve nightmare dinner :/",

Kind of a unique looking restaurant.   I'm a natice Northern Cal girl, born and raised in San Francisco....I have fresh seafood at my fingertips on a daily basis. So I was a little skeptical about a seafood place in Phoenix, AZ.  I ordered the New england clam chowder and it was pretty good. Not too salty!!!! I also had the fried shrimp dish. It was prepared just right.  Overall, everyone orderered seafood dishes and enjoyed them.   The Snicker's cheesecake was wonderful.  Service was good.........a little slow. Apparantly, the server has to manually compute the tabs if you ask for a split check.  Menu is a little pricey, but worth it for \"Fresh\" seafood.",

    "text": "Since we had been planning to go here, I've been reading the various reviews.    I was a little nervous, because many people mentioned it being a very small enclosed dining room where the tables are practically on top of each other...I am claustrophobic, so I became quite tentative about that.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it not as small as I assumed.  The restaurant is basically 3 areas: the bar, the main dining room and a smaller dining room--each separated by a wall and windows.  The main dining room (where we sat) did have about 12 tables.  There were some that seemed close to each other, but there were also a few private booths and other tables.  We sat at a separate table, and didn't feel like we were on top of anyone near us.    Our server was Tony, who was quite knowledgeable about every question we asked.  He was also very friendly and quite attentive.  Now onto the food...It was outstanding!  The bread was quite large, but so soft.  We ordered iced teas (the only part of the meal we didn't seem to enjoy), and they're flavored.  I prefer just plain.  It had a strange lemony flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  However, that was a very slight hiccup along the way.  For our appetizers, I had the Maryland crab cakes, which were divine.  They were practically all crab, something that I'm not used to with some places that serve crab cakes.  And, they were served with a delicious dijon mustard sauce.  My husband got the New England clam chowder, and if we weren't in a restaurant, he would've licked the bowl.  He loved it!  We had the salad, I had the Italian/Bleu cheese vinaigrette and he had the Thousand Island dressing.  They were fine, nothing too exciting, but good.  For our entrees, I had the Beef Wellington and my husband had the Shrimp & Filet.  I had never had Beef Wellington before, and I'm glad I had it here.  It has become one of my favorites.  The beef was so moist and tender, and the pastry wasn't sweet, but had a wonderful savory quality.  My husband kept raving about the shrimp and the cocktail sauce, plus he said that the steak was cooked to perfection and melted in his mouth.  We were so full, we didn't have dessert.  Overall, it was an amazing experience, and we will definitely come back for more.",

I had gone to Sees Candy to pick up some chocolates for my husband earlier in the day and I asked the employees there what they recommended.  Both of them highly recommended the Salt Cellar.  THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT IS UNDERGROUND.  We walked down three short flights of stairs to an atmosphere that was very inviting.  The HOSTESS greeted us with a smile.  The SERVICE was excellent.   Our WAITRESS was very attentive but not overly attentive.  Another one of the staff kept our water, wine and soft drinks flowing.  The FOOD was excellent.  The bread was delicious, especially when we dipped it in the sauce from our SHRIMP SAN REMO APPETIZER which tasted like nothing I ever had before and was one of the best tasting dishes I have ever had.  I will definitely order that again. I had the BLACKENED HALIBUT which was the biggest piece I have ever been served in my life and it was cooked perfecly and the tasted delicious.  The baked potato was also very good.  The BROCOLLI with a touch of cheese sauce was amazing!  My daughter had the KING CRAB LEGs which were cracked open tableside by the waitress.  My daughter said some of the pieces were really good and some were just ok.  For $55 I expected them to all be delicious.  I enjoyed the bite I tried, which was very lobster like to me.   My husband had the SAUTEED SCALLOPS with mushrooms which was absolutely DELICIOUS.    OUR DESSERT was the BOURBON CHEESECAKE which the server gave to us on the house since it was our anniversary.  Nice touch.  It was delicious!  We are all looking forward to going back and trying more entrees and we will definitely order the SHRIMP SAN REMO again if it's available!",

The menu seems to have not been updated since the restaurants inception. The chef could easily add some modern flair to it, update the bread (it's literally a Sara Lee dinner roll), add some variety in the seasoning of fish. The swordfish and halibut were not very flavorful. I know Arizona is landlocked, but I've had better fish in Colorado. Not sure about their meat, but perhaps that's what is best to order. The salad with the tarragon dressing was delicious.  Service: Mediocre, the server seemed to be overworked but she was pleasant.  Drinks: Good wine selection, this is not a place for craft cocktails  Overall, I will not return there again. There are better options in Arizona for good surf and turf. This place has potential in regards to their menu. I'm honestly surprised how many people recommended this place to me, I was disappointed in the quality.",

The only reason I go is because my 85 year old grandfather with dying taste buds remembers how good this place was 10 years ago and he still thinks he likes it.   Order the lobster or order the crab and I swear to god it's been dead for a week. The best place to get 25 dollars worth of food for 150 bucks.",

    "text": "I should preface this review by saying seafood is my absolute favorite type of food, and I grew up in a coastal town with fresh seafood anytime we wanted it. I stopped to get gas on my way back to my hotel in Scottsdale and stumbled upon this place. The decor is nice and the bar is open late. I was hankering for some good seafood and I'm glad that I found Salt Cellar. I came in about twenty minutes before the kitchen closed and both the hostess and server (Maria) made me feel right at home. I ordered quickly: Apps I had shrimp cocktail (delicious and large...very fresh), and Bluepoint Oysters (Huge and delicious). I also had a salad (the croutons were amazing) and a glass of wine that were both good! For my entree I had the fried combo...great fresh fish, fried oysters, and shrimp. All my faves on one plate! The service was stellar too...As mentioned above, Maria was an excellent server.  I'll definitely come back! And I'd highly recommend it!",

The atmosphere is very romantic and the food is consistently delicious, we celebrate most of our special occasions here because they are so reliable. It is all underground so when you drive up it leaves you to wonder what type of place you are heading to.   When family come out from back east we take them here because the seafood is so fresh.  The staff is top notch and have always been accommodating.  I highly suggest reservations, especially on the weekends, It has a quaint and intimate bar and you can enjoy appetizers there as well.  This place is a must for seafood lovers used to the taste of great seafood!",

The food was spot on, we also had a bottle of the white wine that paired wonderful with the lobster. The staff was so kind and very knowledgeable on the menu/wine selection. Our server must have looked at our notes because at the end of the night he brought out a birthday dessert without us saying anything. It's such a quiet, friendly, and romantic restaurant.

The bartender did not make eye contact or acknowledge me for 5 minutes with only 2 customers at the bar. The bar wasn't wiped down and a bottle of bleach or cleaner was on top of the serving area. Once she made her way to me she had no personality and did not smile. She may have just rolled out of bed but it was clear she would rather be anywhere but here working. She brought me the wine in a dirty glass and did not offer water or bread which she did for the other ladies near the register. I had to wait awhile and she brought my food over - never brought the bread out after I had asked. As 4 more sat down she said hello without any enthusiasm or smile. I would do yourself a favor and drive a half mile to Kings Fish Market at Tempe market place for the service. How millennials work in the service industry and expect tips for lack of service, hospitality and efficiency is beyond me.",

    "text": "Yum! Can't wait to return for a full-blown dinner here.  Came here for impromptu apps/drinks this past Sunday and was very impressed.  Not only is the location and ambience unlike ANYTHING you'll find in Phoenix, the food was pretty amazing as well. Are you in the cabin of a fisherman's boat in the middle of the Pacific? Are you in the Arizona desert? You'll never know the difference here.  We pulled up a seat at the bar and ordered a dozen oysters, shrimp cocktail, and fish tacos.   Let me first say that the oysters were HUGE (see pics). The biggest I've ever seen - this might be the first time in my life that I've been full from oysters..the largest shells were the size of my entire palm! I asked one of the bartenders where they came from and he said Chesapeake Bay since the gulf of Cali doesn't produce the best oysters. I found it surprising they were all the way from the East Coast.. they were very fresh.  Sensing a theme here,the cocktail shrimp were also ginormous and super tasty. Cocktail sauce (has some kick!) tasted homemade, and didn't seem like it came out of a plastic tub.  Shrimp/fish tacos were very yummy. They definitely didn't skimp on the portions when they stuffed the tacos and the sauce + coleslaw also had some spicy kick!  To finish, we ordered the Banana Foster. HOLY COW. It was gone in maybe 3 minutes flat. I'd go back just for that.  While this is an upscale restaurant, don't expect to find the nicest of nice things here. The restaurant has been open since the late 70's/early 80's and not much renovation has happened since as evident through the bar cabinets, furniture, etc. I did find it oddly charming the super skinny door entrances (you really feel like you're on a boat!) and that there were high tank toilets with a chain in the bathrooms.   We will be back soon! :)",

We missed happy hour this time but if you have never been, certainly take advantage of their happy hour. It's full of great drink specials and delicious food! We went to the bar for drinks and apps this past Saturday and had such a great time. The bartenders are always attentive, even refilling my wine glass when it was getting low, and they have wonderful recommendations if you need them. We got the oysters on the half shell and wow those were tasty! My husband said they were the best he's had! We also got the flash fried scallops and they were amazing. The chips that came with them were not my cup of tea- a bit tough for me but my husband enjoyed them. We also got fish and chips, which again came with the same chips as the scallops, and the fish was super flaky and fresh. We took our time and enjoyed every morsel of food. Highly recommend getting over there and snagging a spot at the bar. Next time we'll try the dining area for crab legs and lobster.   Note:: there is a limited menu in the bar area but there really are plenty of options. I saw a review below that says you cannot eat in the bar area, that's unTrue. You can eat there however any dinner entrees are not served in the bar area. The website clearly points this out as well.",

For my entree I got the house stuffed lobster....SO GOOD!!!! They crack the shell for you at the table so you can get the meat easily. The lobster was stuffed with scallops. $47 but really FRESH!!!!! They light a small candle and place the butter on top.  I think all the entrees come with the house salad- I picked the thousand island dressing- salad was alright. Main attraction is def the seafood!!  Service is excellent!!! One of the freshest seafood places I have been to in my life.",

I ordered the stuffed baked lobster as my entree, and my boyfriend had crab legs and a filet minion. Everything was cooked to perfection. My veggies and cous cous were delicious, but unfortunately they had to be sacrificed as I could barely finish the lobster.y boyfriend likes his steak extremely rare, and rare it was. I only had a bite of it, but it was excellent.   Our server told us my dessert would be complimentary for my birthday, and gave me a choice from several options. I ordered the amaretto cheesecake, which she brought with a single candle. It was really lovely.   I definitely enjoyed my birthday dinner.

It is not handicap accessible. No ramps or elevators which they state on their website due to the building's structure. We went for happy hour followed by dinner. The happy hour bar is small and dark. It wasn't as cool down there as I expected. The bar areas were warm. I asked to have the ceiling fans turned on only to be informed that they would pull more warm air down. The restaurant section was very well cooled. The bar was very crowded. We sat at the bar as you enter the restaurant. Both had happy hour. The hostess and servers were friendly and helpful. If you go for happy hour be there when the doors open for a good seat. We enjoyed our bar appetizers more than our meals. The shrimp toast was tasty. The crab cakes were excellent. I would go back for them. My husband said he enjoyed his bucket of clams. The Georges Bank scallops were okay. I think they needed more flavor. My husband had the blackened halibut. I had grouper. Neither of us were overly impressed with our dinner entrees. The salad was delicious. There were pros and cons. Considering the prices we expected more flavorful, memorable food and stronger cocktails. It's something different that we are glad to say we tried. I would definitely go back for the crab cakes and maybe to try their lobster.",

My husband sat across from me, had the crab and the crab was placed in front of her husband while the waiter cracked it...so, while all of this is going on, my friends food, and her husbands food are sitting in front of my husband and myself...so, by the time all of the shelling and cracking was complete...their dinners were cold...so, yes, a liberal 4 star because of the atmosphere and the other reasons listed above...",

    "text": "Have you ever been to a place so fancy, that your first thought before you did anything was \"Will this make me look like an uncultured swine?\"  Arriving early for happy hour, before my daughter's birthday dinner, we make our way up to the bar, as the first patrons of the day.  The no-nonsense barkeep, whose entertained both debutantes and scofflaws alike since the Johnson administration, greets us and in a gravely voice, asks \"Whaddaya havin\"  In the lowest, manly toned timbre I can muster, I reply \"An iced tea... please\".  Looking into his expressionless eyes, I sensed that my drink order may have  just broken his spirit.  He returns with my frosty beverage, and a basket of sourdough bread.  Sourdough bread... it's the rich man's \"funnel cake\".  A few minutes later, as we were seated next to Arizona's retired elite, who were downing vermouth and olive juice, scoffing at Ketel One, I noticed a plate of olive oil resting on the far side of the bar (see photo), I proceed to dip my bread... and then notice the viscosity is nothing like I've ever noticed before with EVOO.  The plate of \"coarse salt\" to its left should have been a clue.  Nothing quite says \"you dont belong\", like dipping your sourdough bread in the margarita lime juice.  Needing to salvage dignity, I quickly order the shrimp san remo and fish & chips appetizers... and hoped no one was the wiser.  I couldn't try the shellfish dish, but it was probably my daughter's favorite dish of the evening.  My F&C looked like big puffy cod beignets, and were delicious with their light batter.  Our waitress then whisked us away to our white linen-ed table, where another full basket of bread was awaiting our arrival.  My daughter commented the feel of the room would go well with Disney's Pirates attraction.  After taking our orders, the waiter brings a tiny chaffing glass of yellowish liquid suspended over a candle flame.  I just assumed this was a heated bouquet of fragrance, being too intimidated to inquire  My daughter ordered her first lobster, and I, my first wellington.  Both of our assessments were exactly the same.  I'm glad I tried it, and I dont feel the need to order it again... ever  In time, my curiosity got the best of me, and I inquired as to the canary colored solvent.  It was clarified butter.  Hmm, what exactly can I do with this clear elixir?  It wasn't simply put there for the fragrance.  As the uncultured swine that I am, I proceeded to Google \"clarified butter\", to better understand these fancy-man ways.  Ghee, from the hills of India, which contains some unsubstantiated weight loss properties... so I immediately tossed it back... much like the two ladies with their vermouth and olive juice.  A fun time was had by both father and daughter, as we bantered back and forth about our misgivings with the dessert menu, as \"funnel cake\" was noticeably absent  As we ascended the staircase back up to our awaiting vehicle,  we are instantly transported back from 1800's Spanish galleon to modern day, 104 degree phoenix... while that old, retired lady who was sitting next to you at the bar... you know, the one who had one too many vermouth and olive juices, looks back at you and says \"hey, yous can go around me... its gonna take a while\"  \"Gladly, madame... gladly\"",

    "text": "I've been to the Salt Cellar a few times a very long time ago. This place hasn't changed at all. Small parking lot and a lot of people park on the street. Lots of street parking too. So you walk down two flights of stairs to the bar area and the hostess stand. Very small area with a few cozy dinning areas. Dim lights and romantic setting. All adults and no kids.   We started off with the New England Clam Chowder. It's a huge bowl with lots of clams. Really good and the complimentary bread was so good and soft. Very fresh. We also had the Calamari skewer which came with four calamari on a stick with two different dipping sauces. Calamari was cooked perfectly and not too chewy. It was good not not great.   So with your dinner you get a salad. I was thinking this was a small dinner salad but no this was a huge salad. A normal salad but with the chowder, calamari, and bread. We ordered way too much. 3 out of the 5 people in our party were full after the salad. It was way too much food before our entree.   Anyways, I ordered the Salmon Wellington. The salmon was wrapped around spinach with a nice crusty outside. The salmon was moist and good. It came with a small baked potato and mixed vegetables. Nice meal and lots of food.   My wife ordered the Mahi-Mahi with macadamia nuts with a baked potato and grilled vegetables. Like I said before she ate so much she had to take home her entree. Same thing with my son. He ordered the New York Strip with baked potato and grilled vegetables.   My daughter had the Turtle soup because she never had this before. Black soup and I stole a bite and it was pretty good. She really liked it. They gave a little shot glass with wine in it where they burned off the liquor and you pour in the soup so it's not too thick. Like I said she loved the soup. She also had the Salmon Oscar with asparagus. She gobbled that down and didn't complain so I guess she really liked it.   The service was great. They had multiple people serving you by clearing out the dishes and always filling your water cups. Very nice and friendly. Very helpful.   It was a really good with lots of food, good food, great service, and a really romantic ambiance. Just remember to be careful with the appetizer. So much food but well worth it. I enjoyed it. Very different with the underground restaurant. Enjoy.",

    "text": "Obviously not a hidden gem with 350+ reviews but I do like that it is kind of away from the heart of old town. It has a very cool vibe as you park and walk down stairs to main area of the restaurant. It has a rustic/80-90's fine dining vibe but the staff is courteous energetic without being overbearing. It seems like they work together as you will typically have a server for the night but someone else who takes care of drinks. Respectable selection of wines and liquor. I paid the bill but didn't want to look at the breakdown of what my drinks cost :) . This not for coupon or penny pincher folk but definitely a good experience. The first time I came I had the lobster with stuffed crab but I told myself I would get something else this time. I was starving so couldn't settle for just crab legs or crab cakes. Wasnt planning on a surf turf kinda night but I knew it would fill me up. My mom had the grouper grilled with the blackened (cajun seasoning). We both had the mixed veggies and salads. We all tried the turtle soup just so we could say we had it and Manhattan clam chowder as well. I actually prefer teh tomato base instead of the creamy one because that tends be lots of chunks of potatoes. We had the halibut ceviche and the shrimp mushroom appetizer. It was funny that we were more focused on dipping the bread in the sauce than eating the actual shrimp. The shrimp were semi dinky in size but we had plenty of other food to keep us happy. Creme brule to seal the deal and perfect way to end the night. Thank you good people of Salt Cellar for a respectable seafood meal in the desert",

Seared blackened ahi, quality was good, blackened seasoning was way too salty.  Side of rice was served half clumped, boring mixed vegetables.  My advice: Spend your money elsewhere.",

So I thought I would try something different and took him to SC. Totally pleasantly surprised!  We had two drinks each, he had the stuffed lobster and I had crab legs. Both entrees came with potatoes, veggies and a side salad. They brought out bread and butter before, and for his birthday a free piece of Snickers cheesecake at the end. The food was DELICOUS... and a lot of it. Neither of us could finish it all.  The bill ended up being about $85, and I was shocked, expecting way more. Very happy about that!  The atmosphere is fun, its all underground with a cool little bar. You can dress up if you want, but you could also go totally casual. I like having that option.  I will definitely return and have already been recommending this place to a lot of my clients. 5 stars!",

When I mentioned this to the receptionist, I was informed, by a snotty know-it-all receptionist with non-existent customer service \"skills\" that there was \"plenty\" of parking in the lot, on the side, in the back....   We considered leaving right then and there, and wish we had.  People like this DO NOT belong as a first impression representative.  STRIKE 1  However, I've wanted to try this place for some time so we stayed.   We were given an abundance of bread and it did not take long to figure out why.  They fill you up with bread, so that you won't notice the \"couldn't care less\" waiters, forthcoming small portions and terrible food.  I ordered the Beef Wellington.  It was small, raw and tasteless.   I did not know it was possible to make a bad Beef Wellington, but the Salt Cellars have this failure down to perfection.  STRIKE 2  I asked for blue cheese, and the waiter told me they did not have blue cheese, but a tarragon dressing that was close to blue cheese.  I decided to try that dressing since I was given no other options.   The dressing was ok, but I would not order it again and while I was eating my salad, the table next to us was ordering and, unlike with us, the same waiter explained each and every salad dressing choice on the list, which including Roquefort.   I love Roquefort.   And for this waiter to suggest tarragon as a close replacement for blue cheese when Roquefort is available, tells me that the waiter doesn't even have a clue about the food he's suggesting. STRIKE 3  My wife had the small lobster tail and something that resembled a filet mignon.   The lobster was very chewy and rubbery with no flavor.  The filet was something totally different and unacceptable.  It was flavorless, and so tough you could have used it for shoe leather.   I have no idea how anyone could do this to a \"filet\", unless, as I suspect, it wasn't even a filet to begin with.   She brought it home, and attempted to finish it today, but could only saw through a couple of bites.  The remaining carcass was disposed of in the trash where it belongs.   STRIKE 4  While the inconsiderate waiter showed the desert tray to everyone else, he simply brought our bill.  We both though this was incredibly rude and don't understand the reason for the crappy service and attitudes and total and complete lack of understanding of items the restaurant has to offer.  STRIKE 5  I can't understand why the Salt Cellar is even in business.  The snotty staff has a totally unacceptable attitude towards its customers.  Our waiter knew about all the available salad dressings, but only recommended one and did not even bother with the desert tray.  The food was worse than TERRIBLE.  There was not one good memorable thing about our \"experience\" with the Salt Celler that would bring us back to this disaster.   Everything about this place IS ABSOLUTLY TERRIBLE!",

We went to celebrate a college graduation.  The food was delicious, and the wine great too with generous pours. I had the grilled scallops which were perfect, light and tender, not chewy at all.  Salad was flavorful too.  My only issue with the dinner was the huge amount of baby carrots on the plate.  They tasted fine, but there were way too many and they looked like they had been poured out of a packaged bag from the grocery store.  They weren't trimmed or cut.  Everyone had mounds of carrots on their plates.  (I'm guessing that this is not their normal style.) The graduate had the lobster stuffed with shrimp and scallops to celebrate and she demolished it.  Another in our party had the halibut which he called delicious.  And another had sauteed scallops.  (I believe they were in a butter and shery sauce.)   The service was excellent.   We really had a nice time and would highly recommend this restaurant, both for the food and for the experience.",

Do NOT bother to order anything that is not prepared as steamed or boiled.  We started with steamed clams and the waiter, when he placed them in front of us, informed us that it came with two dipping sauces.  I'm like...WHAT?  The broth is for cleaning the clam of an final sand particles before you dredge through butter.  Whoa. Get a clue.  We ordered our dinner and I specifically said, as my date was getting a stuffed crab, that I was allergic to crab and I am allergic to bell peppers so, with my baked haddock dish, please do not include them with the mixed veggies that come with the plate.  Well...I'm just going to comment on the haddock.  DISGUSTING.  Overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish.  Plopped on top was a GROSS PLOP of praline spread--that was tasteless--that you might find inside a croissant at a bad bakery. The crab was overcooked and tiny and had raw almonds thrown on top of it.  AND my plate arrived steaming with BELL PEPPERS.  As we sent everything back, seriously inedible.  We paid for the clams and got out of there. The rude hostess told my date that I was mistaken about bell peppers being on my plate.  REALLY?  See my photo.  WORST SEA FOOD IN PHOENIX.  I've been here twice. Once about 10 years ago...non memorable.  And then ten years later...still lousy.  Steamed or boiled. Take your pick.  The prices are outrageous for the lack of skill  or refinement that comes out of the kitchen. Also...when a guest says they are allergic to something...GET WITH IT unless you want a lawsuit.",

It was quite an interesting experience, but it seemed like there was no entrances for wheelchair customers.  When you enter, you feel like you are in a fisherman's wharf.  The smell of fish was a little too strong for my liking, but I covered my nose and walked in.  The smell was not too bad at the dining area.  The dining area is very small, and you need to make reservations online if you want to ensure seating.  I was not happy with the seating arrangements as each table felt like you were inches away from the next party.  All the conversations were very quiet because it seemed like the privacy was ruined.  We got some bread and salad to start off with.  The bread had an olive in it, and it tasted very funny.  The salad vegetables tasted kind of stale to me.  I ordered Alaskan King Crab, and it was actually quite good.  I enjoyed the fact the server opened it up for me.  Its 1.5 lbs, but you don't get as much of the crab.  My friend got the Salmon, and it was pretty solid too.  We ended the night with a giant waffle cone banana gelato dessert.  Overall the food was decent, but I think the ambiance with the fish and closeness of tables brings it from a 4 star to 3 star experience.",

They explained it often happens and the rsvps thru OT were for a restaurant in Minnesota! What?!!! They were so very kind to squeeze us in on the spot and find a table for two. This place never disappoints! Our waitress, Toni, was so wonderful; knew the menu by heart and recommended dishes that were very tasty! We each had a glass of wine red / white- Row 11 Pinot noir and can't remember the Chardonnay I had :(- buttery / oaky flavored- so yum! For appetizers, we ordered 1/2 and 1/2 clams & mussels w/ broth & butter dips, that were very good. Our favorite were the mussels. Was served w/ delicious bread and butter. For our entrees, I had the petite fillet, medium, with baked potato and steamed mixed veggies, which also came w/ a house salad. Hubby ordered the Halibut w/ the same sides. Not enough room for dessert, but able to squeeze in a decaf coffee. :) perfect night!  The service and food, once again, PHENOMENAL!!! We can't wait for our next visit!

The shrimp was delicious, but the Oysters were definitely lacking something and not up to par.  I had the baked stuffed shrimp (my favorite), and again something was definitely lacking--flavor.  Our bill for four adults and two children was $300.  So prices have definitely gone up!  Even so, the service was excellent and our waiter was very knowledgeable. The cheesecake and chocolate cake was also delicious.   Unfortunately, my craving for Oysters Rockefeller and baked stuffed shrimp will have to be fulfilled elsewhere in the future.",

    "text": "My grandparents came into town from Florida and wanted to go to dinner. Their absolute favorite food is seafood and being that they live in a place where great seafood is available everywhere, I wanted to take them someplace that would not disappoint. Anytime I have ever asked anyone where to get good seafood at in Arizona, the answer has always been The Salt Cellar.    I want to start off by saying the service staff in every aspect was stellar.  We showed up with one more person than we had anticipated and the hostesses were quick to make the last minute accommodation. The ladies in your bar were so sweet, and our server was amazing.   In regards to the food, my sister and I ordered oysters on the half shell, which were the best we have ever had. My mom got the crab stuffed shrimp and really enjoyed it. My sister and I also split the crab legs and filet. Unfortunately, this is where things take a different direction.  Crab legs were great, but the medium filet was not seasoned at all and was chewy.  My fifteen year old son got the filet and shrimp.  He liked the shrimp, but said the steak was not good, and he usually likes, and will pretty much eat everything with no complaints. My grandfather's fish was overcooked, and my grandmother's fried shrimp was soggy.  We had cold veggies on our plates that tasted like they were warm at one time, but had sat out for quite awhile.    Let me just say, money is not the issue here.  Our bill was 317 dollars after tip, for an average of about 53 dollars per person. Totally reasonable for a great meal. When it comes to amazing food, service and atmosphere I would pay double that.  I do realize this is a seafood restaurant, however for the amount of money that is being charged I would expect to leave feeling that EVERYTHING was amazing.  I originally thought about going to The Keg which is similarly priced. I have ordered different steak and seafood dishes there many times and each time said to my husband, \"Oh my God. I loved every part of that dinner!\" However, I wanted to take my grandparents to a local restaurant and not a chain restaurant that they could go to anytime in Florida. After hearing the great things about this restaurant, I decided to take a chance and go here instead. I was honestly SO surprisingly disappointed and to be frank, embarrassed that I suggested it. It was just, eh. Everyone left saying \"It was ok, but not great.\" My mom and sister who also live here said it was totally not what they had expected.   I did not want to tell the server about this in front of my whole family when he asked how everything was, not to mention we were in a hurry and could not have had our dinners remade at that time had they offered. So I decided to return home and email the manager. In her response she just proceeded to tell me that the issue is their food supplier and not the preparation. She made absolutely no attempts to regain our service. I would have given this restaurant at least three stars but after receiving her reply bumped it down to a 1.",

I figured the 1 stars were just people being cheap well I was wrong.  Positives:  The service was good, enjoyed our waiter.  I had a blast with my wife dispite what follows.  Negatives:  The Food and the Price.  The food ranged from ok to terrible regardless of if it was free our the high prices that I paid.    Oyster half shell:  Small with no real flavor= no Brine taste Escargot:  No flavor Shrimp Toast:  Lots of flavor and that flavor was salt. Wife had Stuffed lobster and said it was ok if over cooked, so 3 star on lobster. I had the Trout, I love Trout.  This was the worst trout I have ever had.    The crowd here was mixed, but I got the feeling that the younger crowd was here off the groupon and the normal crowd is older and enjoys the taste of the food.  I could see someone with a different sense of taste loving this place.    Now the Price is crazy I really should of just left after I ordered a beer and it came in a coffee cup looking glass and the Wife ordered a shot glass size Gin and Tonic for $10.     I guess it one of those places you have to try once and we did, I just wish I didn't have to pay the $150 tab for fish I going to give to my Great Dane.  I do want to once again point out that the service was good.",

Had to wait a little longer due to the change in reservation, no big deal. place was uncomfortably hot. Hostesses weren't very nice and seemed very unhappy. Started with bread that came from some special bakery the sourdough had no sour tasted like  plain whitebreak if you ask me. We ordered the filet and king crab legs filet tasted like a denny's steak, tough, no flavor, had to chew it a lot. Crab was just steamed also no flavor the butter was plain needed garlic or salt or anything for that matter. my grandma had the lobster stuffed with scallops and crab meat, also NO flavor it was all plain again with the plain butter. I was surprised it looked amazing better then the king crab and filet. Last but not least I had the Salmon under thier favorites with the dill topping. It was very small again no flavor the veggies tasted like something out of a frozen bag. Im not being harsh, I'm serious. The baked potato was probably the best thing on the plate. The appetizer shrimp was good also but that is it. Even though it was not the best experience the waitress was awesome and the environment was cool minus ut being hot. Then to top the cake on the walk out the hostess made smart remark just so I could hear it about me changing my reservation from four to five, \" thats the one who changed from 4 to 5\" like who really cares the more the better more money better tip.  Really sucked!! Didn't want to ruin my grandmas experience but that was horrible customer service especially since we are being courteous and maintaining our smiled the whole time it was like the icing on the cake. Do not eat here! I recommend Mastro's or Eddie V's Prime seafood.",

Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.  Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.  When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.  When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.  Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc.   Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.  What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service.",

My mom had the stuffed lobster and was really disappointed, dad finished his scallop dish and seemed happy. My ten year old had the king crab legs and really enjoyed them, I think this was the best entree on the table. My five year olds chicken teriyaki was 18 dollars...we get the hint don't bring your kids. We won't but it's not a nice enough restaurant to get mom and dad to return on a date. Total bill $338",

And being from Baltimore originally, I like to think I know a thing or two about fresh seafood!   My wife and I decided to splurge for our anniversary and we mutually agreed that seafood was the way to go! Upon arrival for our resevation we descended the stairs to the \"cellar\" where we were greeted and shown to our table right away. We were seated in a dimly lit dining room with a few other couples, and despite what other Yelpers have complained about, we did not feel the least bit crowded!  On to the food!! We ordered the bucket of steamed clams for an appetizer (looking back I wish I had ordered the escargot as well). They were steamed to perfection with good texture and flavor, and served with drawn butter and a clam wash! For my entree I ordered the Blackened Sea Bass and my wife ordered the Baked Stuffed Lobster at the recommendation on MANY Yelpers! Our meals were amazing! My fish was seared to a light crisp outside, but was still soft and full of flavor inside! Her lobster was stuffed with WHOLE sea scallops and jumbo lump MD blue crab meat! Our waiter Tony even cracked it for her at our table!  All in all I'm very impressed with the Salt Cellar... food AND service! Don't believe the bad reviews out there. Bottom line: this is REAL, fresh seafood!",

It's such an unassuming place, tucked underground.  It reminds me of the cozy restaurants on the water out east.  The bartender was friendly.  They have a small selection of tap beers, but are mostly local beers which I appreciate.  We got the Manhattan Clam Chowder and the Oysters Rockefeller, both of which were very fresh and tasted great.  All in all a good experience, we will be back here.",

We ordered shrimp toast, too, and it was very tasty.  A few beers went well with the appetizers, and the price was unbelievably low.  I'm looking forward to returning for another order of the oysters and a chance to try the shrimp cocktail.",

It was extremely pricey but oh my god, was it worth it.  My bf and I have both lived in Baltimore, MD for the last 7 years so we are extremely picky and spoiled when it comes to seafood .... Salt Cellar completely changed my mind that you can't find good seafood in AZ.    Only recommendation?  Make sure you have reservations because the seating area is tiny.",

A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it.  We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.  Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.  Return Factor - 80%",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me to this place when he was trying to stop me from giving him the silent treatment... and it worked!   If I remember correctly, as soon as you enter you head down a flight of curly stairs (thus, the Salt CELLAR). I believe you're supposed to have a reservation, but we just walked on in and asked if we could be seated.  Seating was a little strange but we got over it. The place is strange in general, so if you're looking for \"normal\" you should probably save this for a later date. We sat in a tiny room with another family on the opposite end. The lighting is very dim and romantic, and the entire feel is very \"couple-sy\", so you should probably steer clear if you're going through a breakup.  Our server was a straight up Lobster connoisseur. She broke that puppy into beautiful savory little pieces in seconds flat, leaving us with the shell in tact (probably so that we could revel in how much better she was able to do it than we ever would have been, which we did).  We went all out and had the full course meal, complete with paired glasses of wine. It was quite the pricey treat, but it was worth it.  Noteworthy appetizer: The oysters are absolutely heavenly. I have only ever eaten oysters previously at Casey Moores Oyster House, so it was nice to be able to try them somewhere else... but there was no comparison, Salt Cellar's oysters far exceeded my expectations.  Expect to pay well over $100 for two, my fellow cheapskates!",

The appetizer steamed mussels were a plenty.  Enough for 2-3 people.  Two stars for that.  For price and the wait and having to make reservations days in advance, minus 3 stars.  Seating was tight and overcrowded and seemed like a fire hazard.  the idea of it being in a cellar was interesting though.",
