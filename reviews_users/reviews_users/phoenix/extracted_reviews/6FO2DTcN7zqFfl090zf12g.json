A kind gesture one might say!  Until you see that they charged the higher amount on your bill. If it were my restaurant, I would only charge for the less expensive wine as a way to say \"I'm sorry we were out of your wine.\"  Also, the minestrone soup cup is tiny.  Please offer a bowl.",

Personal pizza and a soda was around $16. Not bad considering you're in an airport where prices are always high. The pizza came out in about 8 minutes. Crispy and hot! Very tasty too.  Everyone's entitled to their opinions and I'm not here to refute my fellow Yelpers but my 2 visits were great! It's a very welcome change from fast food burgers. Suggest you try their pizza if you're in the Phoenix airport!",

Upon research this flavor of the water seems normal for the area, so the restaurant should not be marked down for that.",

    "text": "Located in front of gate C4, it is a great option for a quick hot breakfast. 10 minute guaranteed. The Meat Lovers omelet is definitely a good choice. Served with fresh fruit, toasts and sliced tomatoes was definitely a good way to jump start my morning. The coffee was also ready good, not too dark and served just at the right temperature.   Rebecca the waitress was very friendly and very diligent, however the hostess had a little bit of an attitude, I normally don't like to write this type of comment on my reviews, but the hostess of a restaurant that it is located inside an airport has to be friendlier and has to provide the potential clients with the information in regards estimated wait time.  Overall I am very pleased with my selection.",

There was a table next to us where they asked for to go boxes even before their food came and they were seated before us!    Finally when our food came, we swallowed everything.  I remember it was good but not good when you're eating in a rush.    I will probably go there again only if I have 4 hours before my flight.  In translation, NEVER.",

They begrudgingly remade our pizzas in 12 mins but we had to ask for them to go because we had been there so long.  Bad attitude and 3 times the price of their restaurant in Scottsdale.  Granted they are at the airport but at least they can have their act together.  I think it's time for a different restaurant in that space!!",

I would have gotten my food faster if I had gone in the longer lines at one of the other food places. I had a lot of time until my flight but these guys pushed that to the limit. I thought I'd go healthier with a grilled chicken sandwich and it was terrible. It was a bit overcooked on the outside and difficult to bite. But what was worse was that I asked for fries and got chips. The person who took my order said it would come with lettuce and tomato and there was none. It was just grilled chicken, slice of cheese and bun. Pretty terrible experience. But I will say the wings I saw someone eating looked pretty incredible. So maybe stick with unhealthy options and you'll be alright.",

First of all my waitress was very nice and relatively attentive.  Probably knew the breakfast food was trash.    I ordered the humble breakfast (2 eggs, sausage [small, wtf], fruit, potatoes, toast).  For some reason they only carry tabasco, makes me wonder where we're at.  But this isn't 1950s South Carolina.  We're in Phoenix, a Mexican Food Mecca.  That means, even if you're a pizza joint you have salsa at breakfast, or at least a Tapatio, I prefer Cholula.  Getting into the coffee, it was $3.29, it was a .50 coffee at best.  Tasted just like sludge and I'm not sure you could give it a name but it's the Biplane Blend apparently.  Now onto the eggs...Did I get the last of the baked pan?  These were not fresh and they were barely edible.  I guess I'll just go for the burrito at the fast-mex spot two places away next time.  But, what saves this from being a one was the waitress, like I said, she tried hard.",

My order was taken while 3 women leaned on a counter talking... eventually one woman made a few crusts then they ALL left even the cashier. After 15 minutes the women came back to continue talking. When I asked about the pizza one woman said, \"what chu order?\" Then she said \"that ain't gonna happen, we outta pesto sauce\". I asked what was cooking in the oven and she said, \"Nothing ... we got some already made but they ain't got pesto... you want one of them?\" I said \"No\" and she \"well.... I don't know what to tell you!\" After 35 mins of waiting a manager Arrived and said \"oh, did we lose another one?\" Watch the video I posted . How do they pay the rent 'cause they sure aren't selling pizza. These are the people celebrities create telethons and ribbons for out of hope for a cure. You can't cure this! Video will be posted on YouTube... this app won't allow it",

There are better options in Sky Harbor (but if your flight leaves out of the gate next door and your pressed for time, it isn't the worst option either).",

Very attentive and patient servers even amid all the chaos of people coming and leaving and ordering to-go.  With that said, I was lucky to get a perfectly cooked magherita pizza ($10.95), lots of mozzarella toppings and some basil, the crust was thin, crunchy and chewy at the same time and STILL good the next day (for breakfast I heated it up in the microwave and finished it in the oven, for lunch i had the last slice cold, still. so. good.)  It's 4 stars only because it's on the pricey side, but otherwise I had a very satisfying pizza. Trying the chicken parmesan next time like the server enthusiastically suggested :)",

Burger was juicy and cooked just right and a decent size.  Bar staff was funny and engaging.  The burger/fries platter was $12, beer was $9, not outrageous for airport food and the hot food was as much as you'd pay for a crummy pre-made sandwich at one of the newsstand outlets at the airport, so why not pull up a stool and enjoy a beer while you wait for your flight?",

After ordering and paying for my food (several items not easy carried) it was just left on the counter. I asked the guy at the register for a bag (very nicely) and instead of placing my order in a bag, like normal people in his position do, he throws the bag on top and starts taking the next persons order. My hands were full. So instead of speeding up his line he just slowed it down as he waited for me to bag my stuff. I come through here on a frequent basis - I won't stop by Humble Pie again. It's in Terminal A.   I walked past it later and noticed other travelers fumbling with their purchases as they got out of line because he simply could not put people's stuff in a bag. Ridiculous!",

Eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly and the coffee was tasty as well. I'd definitely go back.",

    "text": "Short Review: Do NOT eat here! If you do...you've done so at your own risk.  You've been warned!  Long Review: Oops I did it again. Damnit! I ate a completely disgusting airport restaurant meal. I said I'd never do it again, but I hadn't eaten all day, and...well now my stomach hurts!   Why is it so bad you ask? First, lets start with the name of the damn place! The etymology of \"Humble Pie\" gets its origins from \"umble pie\" evolved from numble, or deer innards. Ok, but let's take that a bit further... the saying \"to eat humble pie\" means, literally, \"to be forced to acknowledge one's deficiencies or errors\".  That is LITERALLY the meaning!!!  Why the f--k didn't I look that sh!T up before I ate there?!?!     Ok, now you wanna know exactly what was wrong? Well have you not read the other 30,000 reviews that told you how bad the food and service are? I didn't either before I ate there, Ok, fine, I'll tell you what I think. But hold on...  So I actually thought the menu was pretty decent for \"a pizza place\" in the airport. Typical stuff like personal pizzas, wings, salad, beer, cocktails. Same old stuff. I had just had 2 bottles of water earlier so I thought I'd treat myself to a Sprite to wash down my pizza. Ding #1: dude brings me a Sierra Mist.  For those of you who know the difference, this pisses you off too I'm sure. But wait...it was lacking carbonation so it was kinda watery. Seriously? Come on you guys!   Next, I ordered the fig, prosciutto, caramelized onion pizza. I've had this before at other, decent restaurants so I thought I could get something good for dinner, despite the awful soda. It came, and the crust was so thin that it couldn't actually stand the heat from the oven! It was literally a bubbly pizza! WTF? I had never seen anything like that. Even the people at the table next to us looked a little shocked. So what did my silly ass do? Yep...I bit into it. After the first bite I was kinda made a weird face.   It can't be this bad, I thought - in denial - so my dumb ass took another bite!! At that point, you know you're not hungry.  You're HANGRY!  I asked for another pizza because it was just inedible. The ingredients were old, you could just tell. So I thought well, they can't screw up a pepperoni pizza, so he brought me that instead. The bottom was burnt! I mean, I could have graffitied the walls with all the charcoal from the bottom of the slices! UGH, are you f--king kidding me????????  I just got the check.   Next time, I'll just starve.   Do not eat here. Do not eat here.",

One of my favorites is the fig and prosciutto.  But you cannot go wrong with the Margarita, sausage or meat lovers.  The meatballs are my usual go to item since I don't need the carbs.  The beer and drink selection are on point.  Most of the bartenders are experienced.   They cannot make a Gibson but most places no longer carry cocktail onions.",

He recommended the SOP - Sausage - Red bell peppers - caramelized onions. Pizza came out very timely - only problem was it was SOGGY - either their batter for the crust was crappy or very undercook. IT was so disgusting - I couldn't eat it - it was like cheesy globby casserole. The service saw my dissatisfaction and offered to bring me another as pizza IS NOT suppose to be soggy - they had another one that just came up the window...  I got my second pizza and it was still soggy - not as soggy as the first, I tried to salvage it by putting napkins bw the crust and the pizza - but the crust was non existent and everything just fell apart. I lost my appetite by then - the manager was nice enough to come by and apologize - I didn't want them to make me another as I had a flight to catch and I just picked off the sausage.  What a disappointed though. I will not be returning. You only have specialty to make which is pizza and this place missed the mark...",

The layout of the restaurant is such that there is a large bar area with stool seating around it, and you walk past it to access table or booth seating. I was seated at a table, which I learned was not ideal: the table seating is set up so close together that your conversation immediately invites all of your neighbors, and I could actually smell the poor fellow's morning breath the next table over. Yikes!  Still, the server was incredibly friendly and nice (Mike, I believe), and asked each patron for their name and called them accordingly throughout their dining experiences. He was very observant about my coffee intake, and brought the kettle over for a refill as soon as I finished the last of my cup. I ordered the meat lover's omelette and asked for no potatoes, and he let me choose sliced tomatoes or a cup of fruit as substitution. The food was a perfectly hearty portion size, and was surprisingly very good! And the wait staff seemed to have no qualms with me spending some time after my meal to drink more coffee and read my book.  I am usually very wary of airport food, but would return here if I need a hearty breakfast and bottomless coffee again.",

Really great pizza that I would happily eat outside of the airport walls.",

I was finally told that my pizza was \"messed up\" (it had gotten stuck in the pan and then fell on the floor in an effort to get it out) and it had to be re-made over the next \"10-15 minutes.\" When I asked for a refund in order to make my quickly approaching departure I was told that it would take a while to get a manager to authorize the refund. Instead I was told I could grab $11.80 worth of pre packaged cookies and/or apples from near the register to make up the price of the pizza. A manager made it to the register rather quickly when I began to protest and I made my flight with refund in hand albeit quite hungry.",

After a long flight from St.Louis to west side of the coast and a quick halt at arizona we brought our semi hungry selves to this place and we fell short of food options at the terminal we were in. We browsed through their selection of pizza to find a vegetarian option and we went with the margherita pizza topped with basil and tomatoes. Unbelievable as to how could someone completely turn around the recipe made with scramble of simple ingredients. The crust was horrible and the basil wasn't baked along with the pizza it was rather sprinkled ribbon cut over the baked pizza with just marinara.It was like the leaves were flying away as we were trying to bite into the pizza. Gosh and the price I know that its airport and its supposed to be pricey but 14 dollars for a flat iron rubber like pizza duh! Please don't eat even if you are starving you'll just end up spoiling your tastebuds.",

    "text": "Not a good choice unless you intentionally want to kill time sitting at a restaurant. Pizzas sound good on paper, but mine was subpar. Service was horrendous especially considering it's in an airport. Waited 10+ minutes just to place our order, so when the food arrived before we even started eating we preemptively asked for to-go boxes and the check in order to get out of there faster. Our check came 10+ minutes later. We tried to pay while finishing our food and could not get the attention of a server for a good 20 minutes, even with my friend literally holding the receipt and credit card up in the air! It got to the point that we had to actually get up and approach someone to ASK to pay. Luckily we had plenty of time before our flight. Even so, extremely annoying and the food didn't save the experience. Go somewhere else",

Maybe they were warm when they first arrived on the line but even the \"sauce\" looked like it had set.   To make matters worse, 3 parties sat around me, all received food before I did. They may have a chance when I return to Phoenix, but for right now, thumbs down all the way!!",

    "text": "It's pizza behind security...the formula pizza on fair crust, with, as most airport pizzas, not enough sauce, cheese or toppings, but plenty of \"fair\" crust.  Their pizzas are all \"personal\"...with formula recipes you request by name.  The dough is stretched, the toppings applied, the pizza put in an oven and baked.  After, it is cut, put in a box and handed to the purchaser.  7-8 minutes unless they are really busy...then 10 minutes or so.  On participating in the 'airport employee opening', the day before the concourse opening of the restaurants, I observed a disjointed system that created lots of pizzas.  I requested a custom pizza, adding pepperoni to a formula recipe pizza; after 20 minutes and a description of the first pizza coming out of the oven with a hole in the middle...I gave up and accepted the formula recipe pizza without the addition of pepperoni.  The quality of the product...not exactly...but certainly a nice free result of the effort.    2 days after the concourse opening, I stopped to order pizza again and requested the formula recipe with pepperoni added.  The pizza and the addition...certainly a pricey opportunity.  The location was not very busy...2 people before me were awaiting delivery, then me and 3 people after by the time I received my pizza.  10 minutes after I placed my order, I asked the guy behind the counter regarding timing.  He advised he saw my order in the computer.    I waited 5 minutes more, and asked again.  The guy behind the counter checked with the pizza creators.  They advised they may have put too much pepperoni on the pizza, and it required a few extra minutes to cook completely.  2 more minutes and the pizza was in a box, delivered to me.    Opening the box gave me pizza with 1 1/2 inch crust...the tastes are good...just want a few more bites of substance than what you offer.  Crust is fresh...just lacking in flavor.  In my travels, I find the crust depends on the water used.  If it is Phoenix water, the minerals are wrong...and the taste is affected.    For the price, it is adequate.  The tough part on my side is finding the availability to pay $11 for a personal pizza.  In the worst world, I can order Dominos or Pizza Hut before I fly and carry it through security.  If the item presented were beyond what I could get on the street, I could see the jacked up pricing.  For me, once, maybe twice a year I could justify spending money here.",

When we first arrived the hostess had next to no personality. We sat down and the waiter we had was quick and very friendly! While we were sitting there I heard, who I believe to be the manager, complaining to two different employees, at two different times, about the hostess. I actually heard her say, \"I think we need a new hostess.\"In my opinion this is not precessional and quite frankly tacky. It is not something that should be discussed in the open and defiantly not with other employees. I didn't try the food but my boyfriend had a beer. The prices were much higher than they should be but you can expect that at an airport!",

The crust was burnt, she tried to eat the parts that weren't and couldn't finish it was obviously bad because they gave her a discount and she didn't even ask, if you knew it was bad why serve it!?? As for our burgers.... I mean obviously not fresh patties I got through a third of it and the greasy tasting fries and our stomachs started to hurt. Then the waitress after we asked for checks gave us these card machines didn't mention how to use them and when I gave her cash she just tossed my change on the table. She had the nerve to have an attitude with US!! We were disgusted. Needless to say she got not tip. We were just shocked and to top it off 2 of us came home to our families with our stomachs hurting us sooo bad!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!",

Be prepared when it comes to bar service to be approached by extremely sweet and hospitable staff. Also be prepared for eccentric airport bar clientele to work this to their advantage in the bar stools next to you.

I'm not sure of his status so to speak in terms of bar hierarchy, but if he's not the bar manager, take a minute to review his composure and absolutely show your appreciation (directed to both the owner and upper management if you conduct reviews).  The kitchen staff works very long hours it seems. Servers asked them why they are still there after being around all day. Their response? \"I work here!\" Absolutely love that sort of work ethic.

When the waiter did make his way around the wall, he took the orders and then seemed to vanish.  He seemed to spend more time talking to the people at the edge of the seating.   Luckily, we were able to catch him and had him prepare our check.  When our food was brought out, they also brought out to go containers.  This was a very welcome addition to our order as our food came with 5 minutes to spare.  I had just enough time to transfer my salad into the to go box and ring myself up on their portable payment machines, printing my own receipt, to make it to the gate on time.  I can't say too much about the price as it is printed on the menu, but knowing I was going to spend what I spent, I would have tried one of the other places near by.

The chicken pesto pizza  was absolutely dry, flavorless, and a waste of $17! They little overcooked chicken peices were tossed in a drop of pesto, and placed on a dry sand disk of pizza dough. The cheese pizza had the most flavor of all 3 we got.

He was pleasant and had the most AMAZING energy! I originally ordered fries because I didnt know what I really wanted... But when he brought my drink (Capitan punch) I thought I'm gonna need more then fries for this... So when he came back to check on me I was like \"can I get...the mushroom pizza?\" As I vaguely remember a pizza that had mushroom on it on l the menu and he says \"the one with prosciutto?\" And as we ALL know, ya girl don't eat the meats! But with out missing a beat and most likely seeing the disgust on my face he said \"but we can just do cheese and mushroom if u'd like\" I said \"just surprise me (I'm on Vacation so I'm down for whatever)...anything just no meat\" and off he went...as I waited I made a new friend....who I quickly converted to yelpism (don't goggle it I made it up)...and convinced him to also try the Capitan's punch he ordered the buffalo pizza minus ranch!  When my pizza came I was like WOW! 1. This is huge 2. There is no way I'll be able to eat those fries... But fires never came! So I asked if he had cancled them he said \"yup\"...like clearly John's a mind reader as well! So my pizza came and I kid u NOT... it looked like something I would have ordered at one of those 'add your own toppings' joints! Like just go look at my reviews and you'll see this thing was crafted from my own mind! Needless to say it was delisous and HOT like I had to blow it a few times HOT and still had to make that O shape with my mouth as I chewed... So anywho if your flying out of PHX stop by..try humble pie and ask for John and tell him I said \"hey boo!\"",

Now the rip off. 33cl of Stella $9.77, after the conversion for a pint = $13.92. I think the menu excludes beer prices so you can't see first hand how you are being ripped off.

The price point is slightly inflated but that's what you get for the airport.   Decent amount of tables. Pretty clean. Server was friendly and seemed to be conscientious of time if you let him know you needed to be quick.   Pros: tasty flavor. Sauce has a good balance to it. Not too thick and overpowering. Good size pizza.   Cons: for the pepperoni, the cheese and pepperoni were all towards the middle which made it all fall off when I tried to eat a slice. The flavor was good but I pretty much had to eat my toppings separately. Also didn't receive any refills till we were about to leave, with our glasses empty for most of the meal.   Overall, there are much worse options at airports. Standard fair that will keep you full. Id come back if I had time to kill between flights.",

Most airports have the generic pizza options. I didn't get to try Humble Pie at one of their brick & mortar spots while I was in AZ so having the opportunity to try it at the airport was awesome.

If I'm going to pay more for buying food in an airport, I might as well be paying for something good, right? Problem is, when it goes wrong, I just feel cheated. They should know better!  Take Humble Pie. Theoretically a gourmet pizza joint in the Phoenix airport, the pizza they gave me was one of the worst I've had in YEARS. The crust was soggy, the toppings spartan, the sauce sickly-sweet and the greasiness unbearable. When I first picked up a slice, all the toppings promptly fell off. I tried to put the toppings back on, but the greasiness of the pizza left me to eat it two-handed: first a bite of the crust, then a bite of the toppings.  Really, even if this place billed itself as a super-cheap pizza joint I'd feel cheated.",

The only reason I give it three stars is cause the manager is a asshole.  He put his hands in the air and told a customer to move out of his way, when the customer was moving out of the way for someone else.  I told him to relax and he just blew me off.  I could hear him being a ass behind the bar too and talking shit.  He needs to be fired cause he is bringing down a good place. His name is Juan!",

I asked for a veggie pizza and the lady told me they didn't have that, so I had to get the SOP and opt for no sausage. The pizza set me back $16 and wasn't filling. If you want a pizza with toppings, you have to pay $2 per topping, even on a personal pizza. I know the workers don't set the prices but the service wasn't that great either. They make your pizza, then call your name out to get it, but if you're not listening really close, you won't hear them call you.   Also very few seating options. We had to sit at a high bar type table, which is okay but if you can't sit at a bar due to limited mobility, keep that in mind that there are few booths, so you might want to take your pizza to a chair near your gate to eat it.",

I scan the terminal, Terminator style, and settle on Humble Pie.  The play on words won me, what can I say.   Digression:  Airport breakfast is depressing.  I'm walking by burger restaurants, pizza places, pubs and the like, all the while my head is telling me, \"It's early, you should have something simple like eggs and hashbrowns\" while my heart is telling me \"Get what they specialize in, you'll regret going to a pizza place and getting eggs.\"  I listened to my heart, much like Roxette encouraged us all to do in '88.  I chose the Margherita pizza and it was very good.  The crust had a great char on it and crisped up nicely while still leaving the inside fluffy.  The toppings tasted like quality toppings to me.  The cheese had a good saltiness to it and the basil was shredded, which is good by me.  The whole basil that sometimes goes on Margherita pizza always ends up sluffing off in one bite, the shredded allows it to distribute more evenly.  Portion size was also good, I was full but not sickly full.  The wait time for the pizza cut it close for my boarding call, so maybe not a good option if you don't have at least 20 minutes to wait for your order.",

Humble Pie offers pretty good food selections. And surprise! It's also tasty. Even local micro brews from Four Peeks. Recommend you stop here for a quick meal.",

As with most airport food joints the humble pie was unassuming and I wasn't expecting much from a weary staff and over worked kitchen, but was in for a surprise. The restaurant itself was clean and was not the madhouse I would have expected.       Our waitress Carol was an energetic and friendly face for a weary traveller to look upon. She was patient and understanding. She had our drinks ordered and at our table quickly and took our order for food in a timely manner. The food was delicious and it was fresh. I had. BLT sandwich and fries. The BLT was tasty (the bacon was crispy) and the shoestring fries were very good! I highly recommend this stop if your on a layover at Sky harbor airport in Phoenix.",

I had a margarita to drink and a margherita pizza (didn't do that one on purpose but the theme worked in my favor). By no means was it the best food/drink I had in my life but I tend to expect very little from airport bar food, and was pleasantly surprised. With my pizza they served some sort of spicy mayo for dipping, which added a nice slight spice to the pizza. Pizzas took around 20 minutes but that's okay because they were made fresh...a rare find in an airport.  The pizza style is a thin crust, similar to a Punch Pizza.",

There was one polite bartender who served my food while two other bartenders were listening in on the conversation that I was having with a friend. The two bartenders not serving me and my friend chimed in with their univited comments while my friend was joking at the bar. One male bartender (dark hair with crew cut) was so rude he told my friend to stop talking at the bar. Only bars that don't want to keep customers tell customers to stop talking at the bar.  I read another review describing a similar experience with the bartenders on Tripadvisor so this is regular occurrence. Complaints are being made.  But this bar is counting on customers to just deal with their rude behavior because most people at the airport are in a rush to grab something to eat and drink.   Avoid this bar. Rude behavior should never be rewarded.  Another reason you want to avoid this place is the food gave me a headache for several hours after I ate the meal. I would give this place a crappy food and crappy service rating.",

Before my boyfriend had announced he was going to go get a pizza, I hadn't been planning to eat anything because I had breakfast right before we got the airport. But when my boyfriend brought the pizza out, he told me that my favorite pizza topping (ricotta) was on it, and of course I had to have a taste, especially since it looks so damn good. Their presentation was on point. After one bite, I suddenly developed an appetite and decided I wanted half of my boyfriend's pizza, oops. It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The crust was amazing- I'm not sure if Humble Pie uses 00 Caputo flour or if they were going for an authentic Napolitan-style crust, but if they were, they certainly nailed it; was bubbly, chewy, and had the perfect amount of oven char. The toppings were generous and fresh and perfectly complimented each other. I can't wait to try this topping combination at home; the caramelized onions and ricotta were great together. It was a perfect size and number of slices (6) to share between my boyfriend and me. I don't live in the Phoenix area, but my parents do, so I will be looking forward to visiting them more often just so I can have more pizza from Humble Pie! :P",
