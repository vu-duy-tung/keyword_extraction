The servers here work really hard, they are always busy here. We were lucky enough to get the table in front of the fireplace,which was on. It made my night because, it was cold and rainy outside and we were cozy warm by the fire. Happiness!!  Anyway, the food was so good, and so much we had to take some home. I had the Thursday night meal, Turkey with dressing. The Turkey is real, not the processed and pressed kind. I ordered for my sides mashed potatoes and cooked apples. Myranda even brought me extra gravy on the side which was so good. We always like to take a little something home for the dog. So I poured the left over gravy on what I was taking home for her. It had celery and real chunks of turkey in it. She as well loved it!! The cooked apples were like dessert. Sweet but, not overly.  Mario got the beef stew dinner. He said it was awesome but, he wished it was more. Because, he liked it so much. Cornbread muffins on the side! Delish!!  To think I never would of known about this place unless a friend wanted to meet here for breakfast about a month ago. I do totally love the little shop in the front as well. It is really cute!",

I grew up in the midwest, and biscuits with sausage gravy and grits was something I came to enjoy a lot. I know there are a lot of \"grit-haters\" out there, and some people who don't like biscuits and gravy. That's fine because you can just get the biscuits with butter and jam or apple butter. They're really simple biscuits, but probably the closest to simple biscuit perfection I have come across: buttery all over with a nice browned crown, slightly crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Mmmm...   The prices have increased over the past 10 years (what hasn't?), but they're still reasonable and you can get a filling breakfast with unlimited coffee for around $10. My wife likes the apple cider that comes in a frozen mug. That costs a bit more than a cup of coffee, and there are no free refills, but she says it is totally worth it.   On this visit, as with most in recent memory, our server was friendly and efficient, and my coffee cup was never empty. Yeah, I am a fan.",

I ordered the chicken fried chicken with hashed brown casserole, scrambled egg whites, grits and biscuits. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was slammin! I almost drank the spare gravy. The fried chicken breast was crispy, yet still moist. The grits weren't clumped. The casserole was so yummy and cheesy! Oh but the biscuits, the BISCUITS!!!! I ate one with butter and honey and the other with butter and preserves. Each were heaven and being that I ate them at the end my meal, I could only imagine what they would've been like hot.

I have never been here on my numerous trips to Mesa and to Riverview Shopping Center because I assumed I wouldn't like it.  But I've been craving Chicken and Dumplings lately and found out they had it so I decided to try them out.    First, the service was cheerful and attentive without hovering.  Second, the price was right: $7.99 with two sides, a corn muffin and a biscuit.  The amount of food was about perfect, maybe a bit more than I needed but not quite enough to justify a to go box.  If the chicken had been any more tender I wouldn't have been able to discern it from the noodles.  The dumplings were the thick noodle style, not like my mother's which were balls of biscuit dough dropped into boiling broth, but they tasted good so that was ok.  The green beans were as good as any my mother made, mushy Indiana style with lots of bacon flavor.  Mmmm.  The baked sweet potato was very mushy with a perfectly edible skin.  I ate every bite even though I was expecting it to be the texture of a regular baked potato.    I'm not a big cornbread fan but theirs was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with good flavor.  I like that they give you one smaller corn muffin and one smaller biscuit for variety.  I've lost count of the number of times I've eaten a biscuit that has sat around too long, or the dough has, and it tastes fermented/moldy, like beans or split pea soup that has sat out too long.  This one was super fresh and had great texture and flavor.    So the entire meal was a success! St. Patrick's Day is later in the week so I'll have to come back abd try their Corned Beef and Cabbage Special for $8.99.",

Last week the hostesses were very rude and refused to make eye contact or have any social interactions with the customers waiting to be seated. There was a bigger girl up there who just stood around gossiping and bad mouthing other coworkers and management. I still give it 4 stars because I love the food and I always notice the manager working his ass off to keep that place running.",

    "text": "I dined here last Friday night and was quite impressed! Yes, the wait was LONG and painful, but their country store held my attention throughout the majority of the wait duration. In fact, I bought 2 Christmas gifts in their store so it was not only entertaining, but productive! Lots of stuff to browse - think cool scarves, hats, baby clothes, toys, tons of old-fashioned candy, stickers, buttons, odd items that you wouldn't find in a mall, etc.  Once our party was seated, we took a long look at their extensive menu. I ordered the Rainbow Trout (grilled) in lemon/pepper marinade with sides of Okra, Mashed Potatoes, and Cheese Grits. OMGeeee! Sooo good! I've never tried Okra but a fan now! The Cornbread wasn't that great, IMO. I didn't care for the taste and the outside crust was a bit dry.  Service was on-point with smiles and helpful advice. Food arrived in about 10-15 minutes once our drinks were served.  I'll certainly be back for more shopping and dining!",

The waitress (Carissa) seemed to take awhile to come back and take our order after bringing us our drinks, then we proceeded to wait about 30mins in which our meal never came. We never even got the biscuits/rolls and the waitress only came by once to say \"our food should be out shortly\"--that was 15 minutes before we left. Still wonder if our food ever got cooked before she realized we had skipped town.  Have had great food/experience with Cracker Barrel, but this was not excusable (especially since it was a Monday night and the place wasn't busy).",

    "text": "Probably out of all the places we ate at on vay-cay this was probably one of my favorite destinations. Right as we pull up the restaurant had a real vintage feel and life to it. Alongside the metal advertising signs and bottled soda in the general store it also contained a genuine wooden porch, complete with big wooden planks, rocking chairs, and cracker barrel's (obviously)   We put our name's on the list and proceeded to take a look around their store, it was a really interesting range of merchandise from all american apparel (trust me I felt really patriotic there), to toys for the kids, and ASU apparel for the college kids.   We sat down and took a look at the menu, everyone in my group kept telling me how great their Chicken & Dumplings were but I figured everyone was gonna order it so I could always try it from their plates. I decided to go with the Chicken-Fried Steak  (which came with 3 sides holy crap), sided with: Mashed w/ Brown Gravy, Mac'n'cheese, and Steak Fries.   When the food came out I noticed my Chicken-Fried Steak was about 60% of the plate.....like disgustingly huge. The sides were a little on the slim side but then again I had 3 of em. A side of cornbread and biscuits & gravy were also provided for us. The steak was a little overdone in my opinion, don't get me wrong it had great flavor but it was a little too crispy for my taste. The mashed w/ brown gravy was tasty. The mac was pretty solid, but the steak fries were bland......had to use quite a bit of ketchup for those.  However the biscuits were super delicious, really fresh and puffy on the inside with a slight hardened outside, dunked with the white sausage gravy and life was good :) I also had a bite of my buddies Chicken & Dumplings which honestly tasted really close to a home made casserole and the chicken was a bit dry, guess I'm glad I didn't order it :) I guess I missed out on their breakfast menu so I'm definitely going to have to try out their breakfast next time I'm in town",

My sides were carrots (over cooked), mashed potatoes w/ gravy (lukewarm), and mac n cheese (best item on the plate).  It was perfectly cheesy and gooey without being mushy.

    "text": "This particular Cracker Barrel in Mesa is where I have had the worst dining experience of my life. My sister and fiance are both servers and they were with me this day as well as a couple other friends. We were seated right away in an empty back section of the restaurant. I go to the bathroom and come back and my party is gone? Our table was moved because oops! No one's working that section of the restaurant.   It took over 20 minutes just to get our drink order taken. We had a couple people stop by and say, someone will be right with you, someone will be right with you. We finally had another server stop by and start to take our drink order. People who had arrived after us were getting their drinks and salads already. Since we'd been waiting forever at this point someone said can we just go ahead and order while we're at it? And started placing their order. By the time the waitress got around to the last person (my sister) she was very impatient. Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions (What comes with this dish? Can I sub this for that?) The waitress literally said \"Could you please hurry up? I have other tables to wait on.\" My sister sat there with her mouth open, flabbergasted that someone would be that rude to her especially since we were getting crappy service already.   By the time the rude waitress (I think her name was Bobby?) finally got our order in and it came out (forever later, no refills on drinks) my order of 1/2 lb. hamburger was wrong and I got a hamburger steak? I think they just took it to the back and put a bun on it but I don't care, I was hungry. My fiance finally gets up to get a manager to explain the extremely lousy and rude service we received and we ended up getting the entire 5 meals comp'd. I don't think we saw our \"actual\" server the entire time we were there. The oddest thing about this whole thing is that the restaurant wasn't even busy. They had sections closed off. Our waitress had only 5 tables or so seated during the time we were there.  We ended up tipping the hostess a couple bucks because she was the only person who competently (not that there's much competition here) did her job.   Too long, didn't read version: If you go to this Cracker Barrel make sure you get a good server and if it starts to take more than 10 minutes to get your drink order taken, you should consider leaving before you even start. I recommend Logan's Roadhouse.",

Or, rather, stuff that you would get, say, in a magazine that you would order around Christmastime or if some kid was selling stuff for school.  They sell rocking chairs for about 130 bucks apiece. But, they're really well-made, and if I had enough room in my car, I would have bought one and taken it home.   I don't usually tell my server that I don't eat meat when I go out. During this visit to Cracker Barrel, however, my friend blurted it out when I was trying to decide between salad and pancakes. In light of this, my waitress was extremely helpful in trying to find me a dish to eat that would be satisfying enough to keep me full for the 5.5 hour drive home. She even went as far as taking my menu and drawing stars next to all the items I could eat. Totally unnecessary, but really sweet.   Hashbrown casserole + homemade biscuits = heavenly deliciousness. And, affordable too!!!",

However, after 8pm or so, the Cracker Barrel on Chandler likes to run out of staples (like chicken and dumplings), but not tell you until they bring half of your meal out. \"Oh, did we mention that we're out of the one thing you wanted?\"   Personally I love the fried catfish with crunchy cornmeal coating, green beans, mac & cheese, and fried okra. If you're in the mood for breakfast, the pancakes are good as well, and the bacon is thick cut and well done. I recently discovered that the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon meal is really cheap compared to a full meal. While I'm not a fan of the biscuits, lots of sausage gravy makes them edible enough. The cornbread is almost as bad as the biscuits. Apparently some people like both, but I can't see it. Cracker Barrel coffee is not that great either, but I drink it anyway. : )  My husband likes the chicken and dumplings above all else, although he'll eat the fried chicken from time to time (DANGER: it's heavy!).   All in all, if you like Southern cooking, you should give Cracker Barrel a try.",

    "text": "What a soul-crushing experience is Cracker Barrel. There is no more miserable experience than eating breakfast at this dump.  Still, Brak and I go here with Bob the Programmer for breakfast after a round of golf because it's close to the course. There really isn't any other reason to visit.  On our last visit, we had a horrible time getting the attention of our waiter. Our drink glasses were bone dry, and we couldn't flag anyone down to fill them. We did catch the attention of the 3 year old at the next table, which is the last thing I want -- I prefer my peace. As is typical at Cracker Barrel, every meal was served on about three plates, so we quickly ran out of table space and had to navigate and consolidate in order to maneuver.  On our previous visit, our waitress stank. Not a working-so-hard-that-she's-getting-a-little-sweaty stink, but a I-can't-believe-she-hasn't-been-fired stench. Every time she approached our table, we held our breath and talked about leaving. Seriously appalling. (Note that we did come back -- I don't know why either.)  The food is mediocre at best. Everything is bland and white, though I discovered that a nice yogurt and fruit parfait. I can't even imagine what anyone would order for lunch or dinner.  I don't have much to say that's good about Cracker Barrel, but I'll try. It has a big parking lot. There are at least 20 paths from the restaurant to do front door, so if you can get past the hostess station, you can always navigate around the gummers and the kids. It is also highly air conditioned, which feels divine after a round of golf when it's 106 in the shade....that'll boil your brain a bit and make Cracker Barrel seem like a good idea.",

We were seated quickly, and it was pretty poppin' as it was a Saturday morning. Ordered the usual, a Raspberry Lemonade and Grandpa's Breakfast whatever. I was super stoked, especially since I was starving, but there is something about the presentation that leaves something to be desired. Translate - Huge plate, small serving. Which I don't mind considering the price, but make it look good?  Anyways it was good. And our waitress had some sass for my friends that needed a \"lesson\" that morning, haha.",

    "text": "After hearing about Cracker Barrel for so long and not having access to one in CA, my friend and I were extremely happy to have stumbled upon one during our weekend in AZ. We're big fans of the carby Southern Comfort foods so I could've been happy just eating cornbread for days. I ended up ordering the chicken dumplings, mac n cheese, and hash brown casserole. I remember looking down at my plate and thinking that it didn't look too appetizing and I had made a terrible mistake. After eating it, I decided that I hadn't, but nothing was life changing, except the hash brown casserole (this was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>, order it and don't think twice). I was most disappointed in the cornbread because it should be their staple and I feel like I've had better, back at my college dining halls. I had an experienced Cracker Barrel friend tell me that they are known for their breakfast foods more, so if I ever come upon one again, I guess I'll stick with breakfast. So bottom line, this is an average place and you should order the has brown casserole. Definitely good for long road trips because it gives you a nice break, fills you up, and is fairly priced. The little store attached to the restaurant is nice to browse through, and the rocking chairs and checkers boards out front are fun to play with.",

I have friends I'd be embarrassed to tell I have been there recently. My 8 year old was with her mother for Thanksgiving this year so I wanted to take her to brunch before I had to drop her off. Cracker Barrel was one of the only tasty places open. Wow, Thanksgiving morning at Cracker Barrel is a beast. They have this turkey deal that all the people wanted, but we just wanted breakfast.

During our wait we played a little game they had at the table. This kept us occupied while the wait grew longer. Our waitress (Rebecca had a single star on her name tag) was very attentive to refilling our teas and apologetic for the wait. She brought us a plate of biscuits to nibble on while we waited. She was very attentive. I was very impressed with her. She did an excellent job doing all she could while the kitchen was backed up. Needless to say it took over an hour to receive our meals. However, because of the waitress giving such excellent service and the food was amazing, we will return. I don't know what the star rating on the name tags was for but I feel Rebecca deserves five stars.The manager did take care of our check. Overall if it had not been for the wait this review would be five star. I even spent money in their gift store. The gift store is fantastic. The best I have seen. I have been to this restaurant before and never had any issues. I was thoroughly impressed for the way we were treated and for the managers no hesitation to go above and beyond in discounting our food.",

    "text": "Loved, loved, loved Cracker Barrel. This was my first time here and it definitely won't be my last. My husband and I drove into town after church last Sunday and were pleasantly surprised. I assumed it was going to be like Denny's or IHOP but it's so much better.  As soon as you walk in, it smells and looks like Christmas. We were initially given a 30 minute wait time but weren't even able to finish our game of oversized checkers when we were called. I ordered the chicken fried steak which came with THREE sides and ordered macaroni and cheese, fresh fruit, and mashed potatoes. I wasn't crazy about my mashed potatoes but my macaroni was fire. My husband ordered a biscuit with gravy breakfast platter, he wasn't a huge fan of their white gravy but I didn't have an issue with it. Our server was really attentive and while I didn't feel as if our food was taking too long he kept coming back to reassure us it would be right out and he kept our drink refills coming. I'm very much looking forward to coming back and trying their fried chicken, I really liked my steak but fried chicken is their Sunday special and both my husband and I kinda regretted not ordering it since it smelled and looked so delicious.",

The service was great.  We both order chicken fried steak.  My husband's hashbrown casserole was dried out and the cheese was so old it was dry.  My mash potatoes were dried out too.  We had gravy on the side and it was so dry it was thick like paste.  The carrots we both had were soggy, water logged like then been on hold all day!  The steaks were not crispy either also like it had been held in a steam oven to keep warm.  I'd have give 1 star but our service person was great!!!   Never going back!",

Also when you check out the cashiers are rude and don't smile. If you don't like your job don't work there? And I will not be coming back here ever again. Also very basic!!",

After eating Thanksgiving \"dinner\" super early due to having to prepare for Black Friday sales as well as my grandparents needing to head home early, I was starving come actual dinner time. I didn't feel like making anything so I started figuring out what options I had for restaurants. I was so grateful when I saw that Cracker Barrel was open as I didn't feel like eating McDonald's or something along those lines. I called them up and placed an order of chicken and dumplings to go. They said it should be ready in 20-30 minutes. I headed down as this Cracker Barrel isn't near me, but it was so worth it. I arrived somewhat early, and shortly after paying for my order they brought out my food. I really thought I'd be waiting forever for my order as they were packed but nope! Cracker Barrel got it done. My food looked and smelled amazing, and I can confirm it tasted just as amazing when I ate it at home. It was a nice Thanksgiving dinner and it was just as tasty as I remember. I think I'll be having this again for myself for Thanksgiving next year!",

It was not long after that the check was dropped off right after the entrees were delivered , think any one might want dessert or coffee you morons. As an old guy whose first job was busing tables in a five star restaurant i was taught its so easy to be a great server , but you have to not give a crap to be a bad one , shame on the management here , they have lost track of what they are supposed to be doing",

My group of friends and I's favorite include the mash potatoes with white gravy, macaroni and cheese, fried okra and cheese casserole.  Entrees we enjoy are the roast beef and chicken country chicken.  The lemonade is also made fresh, and who doesn't enjoy lemonade that was made just for you.    Even though these are my go to dishes, they are just country dishes, but it's the ambience of old times that makes me come back. It feels comfortable and because it has a very neat store with the cutest trinkets and old style items that you wouldn't find in other places. Going to both the restaurant and store is a trip within itself. My fiancee recently bought a toy there (haha), I got the cutest salt and pepper shakers and some ginger beer. My friends got candy of brands you don't see in stores anymore, clothes, purses and signs with the best quotes.",

    "text": "Ok, this is a second consecutive back to back time that me and my family has come to eat here and they messed up my families order. It's not the server, but it's the kitchen that messed up and can't read a simple ticket. I called a manager over, whom happen to be the same manager as last time that came to us, Dave because we had been waiting for 30 mins without everyone having been served so we could eat as a family together. Well my father finally got his food and everyone else was cold obviously because it sat. I asked Dave point blank if he would take care of the bill and his exact words were \"I will pick up all the gaps\" and I said again to reconfirm you are going to comp the whole ticket so I know we are both on the same page? He said yes. So I told my parents don't worry about anything; it's been resolved. We got excited because last incident was maybe 3 weeks ago (last visit) and we waited for just shy of 40 mins for our food and this guy did not even have to guts to take care of the customers. So, I paid the bill and put it behind me. Well this time it happened again and I lost it. To fast forward everything... This Dave has the audacity to bring my family a bill, taking off the food for my father and that's all. What about the rest of the family that had to wait 30 mins to eat since we only eat as a family, not individuals??? If you are going to comp one person, you better comp my whole family because your stores mistake cost our whole families time to eat, not only once, but twice in a row.   So, as a conclusion, I gave this Dave manager several opportunities to fix this issue and his way of fixing it was very very unethical. So I will keep this post up until someone from this organization decides to message me to put a solution together. The customer service from Dave was very very very unprofessional. If I come across abrasive or aggressive, don't get butt hurt, it's whom I am.... a retired Marine Corp combat Gunnery Sergeant with 20yrs of military service. I don't handle stupidity or unethical people well!   Bill Cook",

I had a cup of extremely week coffee and was given exactly 3 creamers - seriously ? You need to ration the creamer ? We should have left right then and there . Knowing we were crammed into a table and on an obvious time limit by the waitress we should have walked out ... But no , we stuck it out and ordered food .. I got the 2 eggs , bacon and fixing plate. Eggs were cold and bacon was awful! Seriously , it was supposed to be thick cut bacon ? It was burned and brittle .. never was offered water, or asked how everything was . My husband was given a dirty set of silverware that we sent back . He had a side plate of the same cheap, salty , brittle \"bacon\". We both left hungry and irritated.  The place was packed , we were chair to chair. So I guess people like it? I know we won't be back. What a waste of money .There are too many places that deserve our patronage .",

They have a row of rocking chairs in the front of the restaurant so you can also just relax if you want about (20) to choose from, food was ok it's just seemed like an overpriced Denny's but your there for the ambiance and experience, in the shops they have giant dumdums to bottled root beer definitely a plus.

Yes, it is more food than any one person should ever eat in one sitting, but it so cheap I feel I must eat it!    This is your standard CB.  Old rustic Americana look and feel.  Home cooking comfort foods on the menu. Cheap prices.  Good Service.  No booze (it takes away from the family atmosphere, apparently).   I love their breakfasts and the chicken fried steak/chicken. Plus, meals come with either cornbread or biscuits.  The fried okra and fried apples are two of my favorite sides. Plus, their pies and cobblers are warm delicious gooey goodness.   This one is near Cubs Park and the big ole Bass Pro Shop in Mesa. It is great if you are in the mood for comfort food and a lot of it!",

There are times when I really can't turn down a chicken fried steak and this was one of them.  Service was good here. My drink never went dry. The other customers were what I always expect from a Cracker Barrel, no matter what part of the country I go to.  Food was good. Nothing wowed me, but everything had good flavor and I ate it all, so I guess that says something.   They were really close to the new Cubs Park, so it was a good place to go after the game.",

Got the fried chicken dinner and thought it was on the dry side. Can't really go wrong with a baked sweet potato. Cheese grits, ok. My cousins country fried steak looked a lil burnt. Dessert was pretty scrumptious. Mmm Blue Bell ice cream :)  I enjoyed the gift shop the most! Cute unique things here. You can buy anything from jams, candy, clothes, to rocking chairs and wind chimes! Very random.",

We barely fit on our side of the table. He was served his milk in little cartons. Honestly I doubt we will return. Our server was pleasant enough. She lacked skills in the details.  But I am Assuming the lack Of details of the floors bathrooms etc probably come from Management down. I had to wait in a long line to pay my bill.

After about a half hour of waiting the manager came by and said the printer didn't print our order and said she would comp dessert for us. Essentially the waitress lied and didn't have a clue where our order was. Really. You make me wait almost 40 minutes and you want to comp me a $3.49 dessert?  They didn't even offer us both one.  If it had been late we have just left. Then when it did come the eggs were cooked wrong. Any other place would have comped the meal or offered a free one. Worst handling of bungled order ever.

Then, he kept coming back and saying \"I'll be bringing the biscuits and cornbread right out\".  Finally, he came back and said \"Oh, we've had trouble with our oven...but your biscuits and cornbread will be right out.\"  Meanwhile, 3 groups of tables around us (that came in after we did) had the biscuits and cornbread delivered.  Our food finally came, I requested A1 steak sauce and waited...and waited..and waited...someone else finally brought it out to me.  My steak was completely cold.  I couldn't eat it at all.  I took 2 bites and pushed it aside.  The waiter asked if something was wrong...I told him the steak was cold.  He said he would get the manager to take my meal off of our ticket...manager came over and talked to us and apologized...when the waiter brought our ticket he said \"The manager only took off half of your meal!\"  So I was left with paying half of a meal that I only ate the veggies.  That was the most expensive corn I think I've ever eaten!  We will NOT be back...and my sister-in-law (who lives nearby) said she will never return.  So...Cracker Barrel...you've lost more than the cost of 1/2 of a meal..you've lost 3 customers...and probably more, because a lot of our family lives here, and we visit as often as possible.",

Took about another 10 minutes for our waitress, who was very cordial and apologized for the wait and said they were short 3 waitresses. That was all ok with my husband and I. We both ordered the southern fried chicken with yam casserole and coleslaw. The chicken was over cooked causing the breading to be extremely dry,hard and overly crunchy. Not much flavor/seasoning. Our side dishes were good. We had a disappointing meal a few months ago at another Phoenix Cracker Barrel also. Never used to have this problem. The food was always good in the past.

We came in here for breakfast at around 7:30 am so we avoided any crowds or wait time which was nice. We settled down into a comfortable seat by the window and our server attended us rapidly.  Coffee here is hot and good tasting and service is fast but friendly! I ordered the \"Old timer's breakfast\" which comes with a couple eggs, bacon, fried apples, and biscuits. What more could you ask for?  Service here is quite efficient so we received our food in a timely manner.  I can tell that customer care is top notch here. And my father and I both value that very much.    Breakfast was delicious and I was more than happy with my selection. So thank you Cracker Barrel for making my dads Father's Day start off great!",

We thought it unusual that the breakfast menu did not include omelettes.  What breakfast menus don't have omelettes on them?  The server told us they make omelettes even though they aren't on the menu.  So, this is what two of us ordered.  The cheddar cheese omelette was probably the worst we had ever received.  The 3-egg mixture was so flat and spred out you could hardly tell it was egg.  The same was with the cheese.  It was really awful.  The server was great but we'll never order another omelette from Cracker Barrel.",

When we arrived there was a line going out the doors, but thankfully our party was already seated when we arrived. We sat down and the waitress came over quickly to take our drinks. The lemonade is so GOOD! It comes it you in a frozen mug and the flavor is just right! We had the option of the breakfast menu and or the lunch menu. I went with the lunch menu and decided to get the Sunday special. The Sunday special consisted of two pieces of boneless chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, steak fries, and a biscuit! The chicken pieces were huge and flavorful and the biscuits were hot and fluffy!!! The mashed potatoes were a little on the dry side (even with gravy) and the steak fries had no flavor.   Our server was great and very friendly! Definitely coming back! It does tend to get VERY crowded in the gift store part of the store (you have to walk through here to get in or out) so beware of kids running around, people trying to shop, and people trying to get through you to get out of the store.",

    "text": "Stopped in last night for a quick bite and some home cooking. Like every trip definitely a most to look around the Country Store. We were sat pretty fast. Our server Megan greeted our after stopping by her friends table to check out something on their phone. That did put a great smile on her face when she did finally make it over to us. She got our drink order and brought drinks back pretty fast, we were not ready to order so again back over to her friends table. After a while she did come back, we ordered. She walked back by and dropped off some cornbread and biscuits on the way back over to her friends table. After about 5 minutes I did interrupt the friendly visit by walking over to her friends table and asking if she could please bring over silverware so our table could eat the bread basket. This was on my way to the restroom we I return she was back visiting again. By this time we did notice that the \" manager\" was also aware of the lack of service. The \"manager\" stood at at the end of Megan's section watching. Finally about 20 minutes after we place our order she went to the kitchen area, but first the \"manager\" did pull her aside. Then food came out Mac and Cheese cold on top, drinks empty and order incomplete. She did fill drinks and bring missing items, dropped the check and let us know if we need anything to let her know. We enjoyed our meals food was good and potions were big. By this time Megan's friends had left and Megan was no were to be found. So I found another server and asked for togo boxes that were brought back quickly, after packing up, Megan did return and ask if we would like drinks togo. So all in all food was great and portions were big. Service or lack of service was horrible by the server and by the management team. Management was aware that there was a problem and stood back and made NO attempt to engage we us to see what was wrong. Food service is customer service. The customer should never have to ask for silverware when dining out, ask for missing food items, walk around asking for boxes, be forgot due to friends come to visit you at work, and made to feel uncomfortable by being watched by management. This was the worst dining experience I've ever had here or any place else.",

    "text": "J and I wanted to take my grandparents out to dinner Saturday night, as a thanks for all they have done to help us with the wedding planning. I give J the task on figuring out where to go, and he suggests Logan's or Cracker Barrel. I think, OOH there's a Famous Dave's there and Papa LOVES bbq. So, I throw that idea out there as well. But since the g-rents also like \"southern home cookin\", we went to Cracker Barrel.   We arrive to find no host at the station and end up standing around for about 5 minutes with no one in sight. Finally, what looks like a manager, comes by and says....Someone will be with you shortly. Wow, really? Finally, the host arrives to his station, and we are escorted to a table.   We wait for our server to come by the table. 10 minutes or so and still no server. Finally another server stops and asks us if we've been helped. J replies firmly, \"No, we have not!\" The server asks us for our drink order and comes back a few minutes later with our beverages. He says that \"our server\" was complaining about another table, or was complaining about another table complaining, so he was going to take our table. Okay, cool cause we're hungry.   J orders the Meatloaf. I get the Chicken Fried Chicken with the gravy on the side. Grams orders the Grilled Chicken Tenders Dinner. And Papa orders the BBQ sandwich. We distract ourselves for the moment with that puzzle game while we wait for our biscuits and cornbread, which finally arrived with our meal.   Grams dinner - She said everything tasted fine.  Papa's dinner - His bbq sandwich was according to him (he does NOT hold back when it comes to his opinions, especially food) dry, stringy, tough, and under seasoned. I asked our server for a side of bbq sauce so he could eat.  My dinner - The only thing decent was the Okra and the Apples. The Mac and Cheese had what looked like black plastic in it. After I got done picking it out and putting it on the side of my plate, it looked to be about 1/3 c of the black crap. I told J, \"What the hell is this!?\"  J's dinner - The meatloaf was bone dry. The mashed potatoes and gravy were cold. Literally, the gravy was congealed.   J was fed up, and he got up to seek out a manager. The manager came back and was combative with him. He said, the black stuff was cheese. REALLY?! Since when is cheese the consistency of melted plastic and black in color?! He offered to have our meals replaced. A few minutes later, our dinners come out. J says that it looks much better. I pick through the Mac and Cheese and find no black crap. Alright!! Let's chow! Not even 30seconds later, J's sitting there staring at his mashed potato loaded fork in front of his face. I look over and immediately start laughing. Its a HAIR! You've got to be kidding!   The server comes by a few seconds later and says, \"How's everything...\" and stops mid sentence. He sees J staring at something on the fork. \"Oh no, that's not good\" our server says. He goes off to get the manager. I cant stop laughing.  I cut into my chicken, and without looking take a bite. Hmmm, something was off. I look down and yeah, that's not chicken fried chicken. Its chicken fried steak, which I LOATHE. I just think tenderized meat tastes like its already been chewed.   The manager comes by and apologizes for everything and says our dinner's are free (including my grandparents). You're Dayumn'ed right they better be free!! We do leave our server a tip, since the quality of our dinner was not in anyway his fault.   Papa, without missing a beat says, \"Well Lorraine, you want to come back and try breakfast here tomorrow?\" Grams says, \"Yeah, I don't think so.\"   In a nutshell, we shoulda gone to Famous Daves.",

I ordered what should have been simple: eggs over easy and bacon. Cook didn't get it right - how hard is it to do eggs over easy. Well, they were overcooked. The eggs were obviously cooked together and separated with a knife. The yolks were medium hard. The worse thing was to come: biscuit and gravy. The biscuit had an overwhelming baking powder taste. The \"gravy\" was disgusting. A thick, gloppy mixture of water and flour with some salt for seasoning an a few bits of sausage. It was inedible. Just gross. The coffee, while abundant, was thin and a pale imitation of real coffee. But the other customers just ate it all up like this is some 5-star joint. It's lousy, poorly cooked garbage. There are some places in town that do breakfast so well, and make real homemade biscuits and gravy. And some of the customers at CB are so effing fat - I mean whales! The probably eat there too often - the processed food and starch shows on their guts. Go elsewhere. Cracker Barrel needs to completely revamp its product. BTW, waitress was great and the shop out front interesting, especially if you like Christmas when Halloween hasn't even arrived.",

This gentleman spent a fair amount of time speaking with us at the table and just seemed bothered by the fact our service was so NOT there! Our servicer Ro was very sweet just seemed to have more than she can handle or maybe just had an off day. I gave them 3 stars being the service was off but the food was still pretty good. I had to ask for the one part of my meal but what topped the food is, we were told \"someone paid it forward\" I thank the person who did this yet I feel that because the server forgot about us is why are meal was paid for by management. I could be wrong!

Out of appreciation and courtesy,  we were rushing eating but the waitress told us not to worry and enjoy our meal and not to feel like we had to hurry.

The biscuits are warm and moist, and taste so delicious spread with apple butter.  The pecan pancakes are nutty and so tasty that you wouldn't need to spread syrup. The country fried steaks was a little dry, but saturate it with gravy made you forget the dryness of the beef. The country fried steaks was served with two eggs and hash brown casserole, which hashbrown baked in cheese..and was pretty good...its like potatoes and cheeses. Best part about this is that its served in large portion and the price is reasonable.  Now after eating go shooping for cutesy stuff like baby or toddlers outfit or country style rocking chair or candies. .or whatever you need in general store. Cracker Barrel is not only a restaurant it's literally a country store .",

The hostess was confused and slow to seat us. The server took a long time to bring drinks, take our order and bring food. She was only quick to bring the check and let us know her shift was done. The food was mediocre. My country fried steak was chewy. The poached eggs were overcooked and rubbery. The biscuits weren't fresh. My husband's sweet potato was burnt. We have young children and the slow service made them restless and a nuisance to other guests nearby. I will be back to Cracker Barrel but not this one.",

Right off the bat I'm already not in the best mood having come home from the hospital at 5am and spent nearly 5 hours there trying to get through over 8 hours of contractions (only to find that there was no chance I was having this baby yet). *sigh* Anyway...in hopes to cheer me up my husband suggests we get some of my fav pancakes at Cracker Barrel (this is a big deal for us since we have been dieting for the last 4 months, plus we even had our trainer's approval for an epic cheat meal). I get to my table and sit down to find that I sat in a pile of watery chocolate milk....gross.  I called someone over to complain and there was no \"Oh! I'm so sorry that you will be uncomfortable eating the rest of your breakfast with a wet sticky butt because we didn't properly wipe down or check the table and chairs for spill and crumbs. Please let me see what we can do to make up for it\" ...all I got was a new chair and measly \"oh sorry...\"   I might be making a big deal out of this but that's gross and annoying! I really don't enjoy trying to eat my only cheat meal while feeling like I peed myself :(   Moving on... Food. Pancakes were great as usual. Eggs over easy were done just the way I like.  I ordered turkey sausage but didn't get them until I almost finished my meal. Turns out one of the runners forgot who it was for and it sat in the window until someone remembered who it was for.  Husband requested hot sauce and ketchup. Only the hot sauce showed up. Also, the butter he was given was grainy.   Shannon G was our server. She was very polite and looked genuinely shocked and upset when she found out I  hadn't received my sausage. She offered to refill our apple ciders to make up for it (nice gesture!) but we were already full and ready to get outta there. Shannon, the extra star is because of you.   Overall. I was full, but left more annoyed than when I came in, wet butt and all.",

S.L.O.W. service: The place was almost empty, we were seated promptly & then waited 10 minutes for someone to come out and ask us what we'd like to drink & tell us our waitress would be with us momentarily. 20 minutes in our waitress finally came over to take our order & that was only because I grabbed someone who walked by and asked that they give her a message from me that we were ready to order.... this was all just to put in our order, we'd been seated for well OVER 30 minutes before our food came out (2 eggs over easy, toast & oatmeal)... maybe they were chasing the tiny chickens around to get our eggs? My coworker ordered oatmeal (not hard) & they forgot to put in the only thing that came in the oatmeal, the nuts. NUTS.   Tiny eggs (maybe the chickens are getting smaller?).

I got a pancake combo with hashbrown casserole and over easy eggs. The pancakes were huge, and kinda had a burnt taste to them, but the casserole was sooo good! It's cheese and potatoes and onions and all sorts of yummy stuff, save for meat, rolled onto your plate in a gooey ball.  My boyfriend got a pancake combo too with turkey and eggs as well and devoured the whole thing.

But that's from a business perspective. Personally I find it strange that it works, but it does. I am not a big fan och CR, but I do have to eat here some and the service has always been OK. Sometimes stellar, but that is not my average impression - to float between OK and stellar, is a good average still.   The food is also average. And from a health perspective it is basically same as fast food. They cheat to cut costs like everyone else in the dirty restaurant business. However, if I found a place that was like a CR out in the wild west, but wasn't a franchise - I would have loved it.   Absolutely nothing to write about in your diary. But I have no real complaints either. Middle of the road experience on all accounts. Still impressed that the image fools those who wants to believe that is it something its not.

To make matters worse, a family of five was seated next to our party where almost every member of the party was coughing uncontrollably. All of my family members (including my 90+ year old mother) are extremely worried that we may have been put in harms way with potentially contracting TB or whooping cough or some other severe respiratory disease from these individuals. After paying for our bill, I asked to speak to a manager about our experience. Unfortunately, this individual didn't appear to understand her leadership role and what it takes to instill confidence in her customers. She kept repeating that she was sorry, and she would pass along the feedback to her general manager. As if that was going to improve our experience and overall impression of this restaurant! There are too many choices in this retail/restaurant complex to settle for mediocre food and service from this establishment.",

    "text": "I spent a weekend in Phoenix and I had to stop at a Cracker Barrel in the area at least once so I came here for dinner on the 18th of September. This time I ordered chicken tenderloins (deep fried). I had the choice of three sides so I picked cheesy grits, pinto beans and the vegetable of the day which happened to be cabbage. I was asked if I wanted biscuits or corn bread and I asked for two biscuits. When it came to choose a beverage, I chose an old-fashioned lemonade. The restaurant was moderately busy but the food took only about 10 minutes to arrive. My tenderloins consisted of 6 chicken strips. They were good but I felt they were more indicated for a kid that does not yet appreciates good country style cooking because they were good but they did not have the complexity of flavor of many dishes I tried at Cracker Barrel before. The grits were good: they were light and coarse. There was cheese on them but I could not really taste it. The pinto beans were fairly standard. The cabbage was definitely the highlight of the night. Apparently, it is only available on Sundays. It was boiled in water with ham and it was spiced with black pepper so it was salty and complex in flavor. It was truly a good side. I liked it very much and it filled me up fairly quickly. The biscuits were also standard but somewhat dry. The lemonade was great and extremely refreshing, truly perfect for the Arizona temperatures. Our waiter was nice and she came to check on us many times. All in all it was a good dinner and I will come again but I will try something different from the chicken tenderloins.",

Spending almost 2 hours we talked to the manager on duty who could care less. Our food was ok and the waitress was apologetic . The manager offered to adjust the bill however since staff is not properly trained and restaurant understaffed I will never return to this location thus refused a price adjustment . Don't go here on Sunday's !!!!",

We waiting forever and so hungry & my husbands 1st bite he started choking I started yelling no one heard me because it was SO loud. I started waving my hand standing up freaking out saying he's chocking! NO one heard or seen me because it was that loud.. I saw the guy walk bye who walks around checking for empty tables and he didn't hear me or look at me, So I started the Heimlich remover looking around and NO one paid any attention to us, probably because they all waited so long to eat.  The piece of sausage went down. I was so shaken up. When the waitress came I explained what happened and told her to bring the bill and to go container. Looking back we should of just left since we didn't eat anything. Instead I packed everything and waited in the long line to pay. I told the cashier what happened but they weren't phased just like waitress.  The reason he chocked was because the sausage was crumbled like ground sausage. With that experience and lack of concern I don't see us ever going back. I didn't even the food we brought home because I was afraid of choking .",

They even have little kid size rocking chairs.   So I like the food here because it reminds me of my Sunday dinners with my grandma. She would make all of the fixings like corn, mashed potatoes, cornbread and ham. I just feel like home when i come here. The ham is super good. Get it with mashed potatoes and gravy. Plus go with the corn. Yummy for your tummy. The breakfast menu can fill you up as well. You will not walk out hungry.   They always offer a Thanksgiving menu during the holiday times and you can preorder these meals to go. This is a very popular item on Thanksgiving day. I eat here every Thanksgiving year and I love it. The staff works very hard and they are busy.  I give props to the staff in the back who are making all of the meals.   Sundays are a very busy day so expect to wait. Many people come here right after church.  There is a little something for everyone at this place.",

So when visiting my brother in Arizona and I find that he has one less than 5 minutes away, I made sure that we went. Over the weekend, I went 2 times, and I always get the same thing when I go. I get the Momma's french toast breakfast with a side of the loaded hash brown casserole. The service, as always, was amazing both times. All servers I have had at Cracker Barrell are always so pleasant, helpful and attentive, which is one reason (other than the delicious breakfast food) that I continue to come back. There is also always a ton of interesiting things to see in the store part when you first walk into the restaurant which is always exciting. I, of course, will be back when I have the chance.",

The pancakes were crunchy, and you could taste the oil/butter used to cook the pancakes. It was like butter on butter. I liked the the little individual syrup bottles made for everyone to use.

Not sure, what they're called, but it's like a candy cane basically, a thin stick I think? We bought 8 of those for $1 after our meal, it was supposed to be 20 cents each. But anyways, you get there, and there are a bunch of rocking chairs for you to sit on and play a game of giant checkers, and you can even buy a rocking chair if you'd like.  You get in and, like other reviews, it really is like a gift shop, and then you walk into the back which is a HUGE and clean restaurant that has a great atmosphere and seats plenty. We immediately got our table for two and I ordered the Country Fried Steak Breakfast platter that also came with 2 eggs cooked by my choice, 2 biscuits with gravy, grit (which was sort of plain, but I threw some gravy in to try to make it better, it was my first time trying grit), and hash brown casserole. ALL THAT FOR $7.99!? What the hell, I've never seen a price that great for that much food. My brother got something similar and then ordered a side of sausage patties, which went perfect with my biscuits. I got my order and the first thing I did was make a sausage mcmuffin, the country fried steak was good and so was the casserole, though it coulda been hotter and crispier, but it was still great.  Great food, great price, great service. I won't be eating for another 5 hours probably. Food Coma time, goodnight!",

Our waiter kept up with our beverages in the blink of an eye so the slow food must have been due to the chef. We all ordered breakfast (served all day BTW) mine wasnt fresh off the griddle hot. I wasnt too impressed with my meal but my daughter and my boyfriend lovedddd theirs and I know we will be going back.",

    "text": "I like Cracker Barrel. Well...at least this one. I've never been to any other location.   No, the food isn't great (at least the lunch/dinner options), but it's not bad. It's been awhile since I've been here for breakfast, but if I recall that stuff is actually quite good (and cheap).  My dad freakin' LOVES this place. We came here for his birthday dinner recently so that's what I'm basing this review on. I got fried chicken and it came with two sides. The fried chicken was actually quite good. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and nice & hot. Cracker Barrel gives you several different side options w/there meals (like, around 10). I had the hash brown casserole thingy, which is also a side they serve with breakfast meals. It's yummy! Basically, it's cheesy hash browns. I also got turnip greens. They were OK, but not great. They were kind of watery & lukewarm. I get the impression most of the sides at Cracker Barrel are cooked well in advance and just sit around most of the day. I also think turnip greens are most likely an unpopular side, and therefore probably sit around longer, without a fresh batch getting made.  I also had some lemonade to drink. It's basically liquid diabetes, which also means it's delicious!   This place is ALWAYS packed (on the weekends anyway). This was the first time I've been here since moving back to AZ in June, but it's not for lack of trying. I've tried to stop in w/my parents a few times over the past few months, but the wait was ridiculous (this past time we waited 20 minutes for a table, which really wasn't all that bad). Cracker Barrel has a gift shop set up as you wait where they sell overpriced country/southern novelties.  Service was fine & the food here is VERY affordable. I probably wouldn't choose this place, but I don't mind coming here at all w/my dad who like I said, LOVES this place.",

The bold manager that was there was not very friendly at all... I felt like he was making a very hostile work environment for the other servers due to supposably High management there that day reviewing them. You could see the tension on all the servers faces me as a customer felt it also. Seeing him yell at 2 servers that we're walking in to their shift telling them to get to the bathrooms and get themselves ready before they come back to do that in front of customers was very rude I didn't appreciate it there's a place in time you can do that not in front of customers. Our server was also told they couldn't bring a picture of Ice-T to our table due to him being there. There was 8 of us at the table all drinking iced tea made it very difficult for the server to have to come back and refill every time. So service was awesome... Mang made it bad. Food was ok. Stake came out still mooing was asked to be cooked medium rare..",

    "text": "This is a tough one to rate. I've been to a Cracker Barrel before and it was alright dining in.    This time I decided to get a meal to go, since i was traveling alone, and my hotel room was ready with the a/c cranked up full blast I figured i'd just be comfortable and have my meal elsewhere.   I called ahead after reviewing the menu and I  asked if there were any specials, I was informed that the special of the day was a turkey dinner.  I thought about it and after looking at other options, decided to go with it.  The lady on the phone was polite and easy to understand and I was told that my meal would be ready in 5 minutes.  Luckily i was just on the other side of the shopping center and was there in 5 minutes.   The meal wasn't ready so I wandered around the gift shop part of the restaurant for about 15 minutes admiring the Christmas items for sale.. It's only September (too soon in my opinion)    The person that brought out the food in a to go bag double checked the order item for item and it was correct.  I headed back to my hotel and laid out the items: corn bread stuffing, turkey, cranberry dressing,  corn bread and biscuit with apple butter,   mac   n cheese.  With all the items in their respective containers and sitting on my table the meal somehow lost its sparkle.  having a large plate with just a couple pieces of turkey, gravy and cranberry dressing just looked depressing, but if it all the items were together it would just be a mushy mess by the time i got to it. I picked through the different items, the cornbread dressing was good, the turkey was just OK,. the cranberry dressing was pretty tasty, the gravy tasted like something from the store, the mac n cheese was lacking flavor, the apple butter was good, but I wasn't sure where to put it so it ended up on one of the rolls.    Overall i guess the experience was alright, and a meal for $10 isn't bad.  I'd probably go somewhere else given any options.",

I'm a newly single mother with a 6 month old who likes to grab everything off of the table and managed to get ahold of my milk glass and spilt it everywhere. The staff helped me out so much and it brought me to tears. Unknowingly to them, fiance and father of my son passed away 6 weeks ago and I've been having a sad day today. I wanted to cheer up so I drove myself and son all the way out here to cheer myself up and start the day off right and I'm glad that I did. I was clearly struggling and the woman behind me happened to be a staff member as well and cleaned up the mess for me. They also comped my meal, which was as always amazing. I didn't get a chance to thank the manager on duty but will be writing them as well to let them know that they were so kind to me. This place deserves 10 stars. Thank you so much",

We ordered dinner and it was pretty busy being Friday night. Every thing was good and came out very fast. Steak was cooked perfecty and The Rainbow Trout was really good, it even still has the skin on it. So it was really moist.  Prices are super great here and service is always good.  The food is a lot , and it tastes great! We really like the little store in front as well. They already had the Halloween stuff out for sale.  Halloween is only 3 months away.",

It's filled with a lot of old fashioned toys, some souvenir type stuff, candles, clothes, and other unique items...pretty cute. Then the restaurant is decorated with a ton of antiques, old photos, and a giant fireplace. They have checkers tables while you're waiting and little peg jump games at each table. It's not too loud, but a little crowded. A lot of elderly people must enjoy coming here...they had their walkers all parked around the fireplace. But anyway, the waiter, the hostess, the manager, they were all exceedingly nice! And the food, (I had the fried chicken, she had the dumplings plus choice of 3 veggies) was excellent! I couldn't stop eating! No room for dessert. But, I'll definitely be back! Not too overpriced either. Oh and great biscuits and cornbread!",

They were not perfectly round and have fresh blueberries, so like what I would make at home.  Not the perfect cookie cutter ones like at IHOP.   I did love I got my own jar of blueberry compote, it was warmed up too.  (I kept the bottle, I love little things like that.)  Every dish on the menu was meat, except for the veggie platter (I believe that is what it is called).  The breakfast menu was the one that had the least meat dishes.   The server was very friendly, I asked for decaf iced tea so he brought me hot decaf tea and a cup of ice.  Like that he did that.  The server was very nice.  We got there around 7 pm, it was very busy with in an hour many of the snowbirds had left.    The food took awhile to get to us after ordered it.  The place is also very packed together.      They give us biscuits and a cornbread which are very dry and flavorless to me.  (we always make our own bread and cornbread so restaurant varieties just don't match up).    If anyone is eating post weight loss surgery and don't eat meat, it's not a very good place.     The store had a lot of cute kitschy items.  I didn't check the whole store, but they had a lot of candy in big boxes and some toys.  They did have a lot of kitchen and rooster items for the kitchen.  I thought those were adorable.",

    "text": "My rating is mostly due in part by the inexcusable long wait we endured before our meals were given, and the other part is the food was cold! One of the items I asked for was never brought to the table. It was August 28,2019 and my family and I were there having a breakfast for my mom's birthday. Now, why didn't I just alert the waiter? Well, I have a 4 year old daughter with autism. Due to the fact that waited so long for our food, she became restless and began to act understandably upset. I was prepared to take her out of the restaurant, but not before an old a$$hole who just barely got there after we had been there a while, shouted \"take her outside!\" I was already mortified that my daughter was causing a raucous, I UNDERSTAND that not everyone wants to hear a child throwing a fit. However, I do my absolute BEST to keep her calm and distracted. So I gathered my child and things and told the waiter (who was very nice) to pack my food to-go. That is why many things were overlooked. This post is more than a review, though. I want to spread awareness here and I would hope Cracker Barrel and other restaurants can become more educated when it comes to autism, because there is no \"looks autistic.\" People with autism look \"normal.\" More and more places are becoming autism friendly and I implore Cracker Barrel to follow suit. Just as that rude jackass had a right to eat there, so do I and my ASD child. Here is a way you can expand your business and become an inclusive restaurant.  wwwDOTpalexperiencesDOTorg/become_a_pal_place",

That being said the same breakfast I ordered at this location was not the same quality as the Wild Maine Blueberry pancakes were not as great in flavor and the hash browns were soggy rather than crispy. The biscuits & gravy lacked flavor, I've had better from home. Personally would not return to this location again.",

I have been to this restaurant several times and have rarely felt a warm welcome and was under the impression that the hosts as well as the severs are just going through the motions of trying to be friendly because company policy requires it. The food has been decent but not fantastic. It seems like most of the entrees are over cooked bit. Overall I would chalk it up to poor management and lack of training for customer service as well as meal preparation. I hope this location can one day be as good as the others I have visited in the past.",

And we ended up having two waitresses which didn't make sense.   We were sat In a section with no one else in it but an individual who was almost done with his meal. I say this because when we ordered, other tables got sat next to us and then they ended up (both tables) getting their food before we did. Maybe I'm expecting too much.   The food was fine. I think it's basic and yes country food. No excitement for me. I got the double meat option. I specifically asked for extra crispy bacon, that didn't happen, I asked for extra crispy hash browns, that didn't happen that is not our servers problems or maybe depending on how they took the order.   The sausage was fine but tasted ummm like it was frozen. Eggs were medium and I should have got soft but it was fine.   I figured out the pinhole game and ended up having one tee remaining which was the most exciting part of the breakfast experience. The country secretly gave me anxiety with all the nicknacks and \"junk\" in it. People buy this stuff and I don't understand, to each their own. Anyways 2 stars and I would only be back to meet with friends or fam not a place I will ever frequent. Sorry CB.",

My son and I came in for dinner, (we usually have breakfast).   Our waiter was on point and very attentive. Great customer service. (Wish I could remember his name.)   My son ordered the Country Fried Shrimp with the Macaroni n' Cheese, Loaded Hashbrown Casserole and the Dumplins. All of which was pretty good. (I'm not a huge fan of their Macaroni n' Cheese though.)   I ordered the Country Fried Steak with the Country Green Beans, Mashed Potatoes and the Cole Slaw. Good flavor on Fried Steak and Potatoes, and I'm a HUGE fan of their Gravy! Green Beans were just average I thought, but the Cole Slaw was very good. (I love Cole Slaw!)   We ordered their Tea for drinks, which was good. And no dessert. We were stuffed, too much bread. LOL.   And as usual, we walked around the store for about 15 minutes before paying our bill. They have some really neat things, OLD & NEW. We ended up buying some bottles of Root Beer. They have a HUGE selection to choose from.   Can't wait to go back again!",

Here is my disclaimer: I have not been to the South, so my judgment of Southern food may not be the best. However, my boyfriend's family is from Mississippi and Georgia, so I feel like his judgment should be trusted. He ordered the meatloaf, which is his go-to (as he's been before). Since it was a Wednesday, I wanted to order the lunch special, which was chicken pot pie, but when I was set to order, they informed me that they ran out. I was a tad bit disappointed, but I ended up ordering the Baja fiesta grilled chicken which had chopped green chilies and cheese melted on top of grilled chicken. There was nothing really special about the dish. My three sides included corn, steamed broccoli, and Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was delicious and the vegetables were also good. My boyfriend really enjoyed his entree, but out of his three sides, he only liked the corn. His fried okra  seemed as though it was just warmed and not freshly fried as it was not hot and crispy. His dumplings were chewy and tasted of uncooked flour, so he did not finish them. Overall, the food was okay and the service was good. Next time, I'll have to have some dessert as they all looked delicious.",

I compared prices to other places on the list and honestly CB had the best value.  Placing my order online was super easy...nothing fancy but very simple and efficient web ordering.  I didn't need to change my pick up time and there's no way to do that online so I had to call the location to make that change.    The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the pick process was a bit chaotic and confusing.  We arrived 10 minutes early to a very busy, loud, and jammed packed restaurant. Once inside there wasn't anyone directing traffic and there were people in multiple lines so we weren't sure where to go.  We waited inline about 5 minutes until I finally found someone to ask where to pick up catering orders. Her reply \"Ummm I think you pick them up behind the restaurant.\"  She wasn't sure which kinda irritated me but we decided to get out of line to make our way in the parking lot behind the restaurant. She was right! There was a tent and line in back with customer picking up there orders.  The line moved kinda slow and it was a bit unorganized but they had our order ready to go and all the employees were very pleasant. We did have to have exact change if we wanted to pay in cash which was a little inconvenient.   The food was amazing! Everything was hot, fresh, seasoned and way better than I expected. Like I said earlier it was a great value. Enough to feed 4-6 peoples easily.  I told my husband that ordering from CB was our new Thanksgiving tradition and I was never cooking again LOL. I can't wait to try some of the other side options next year.",

    "text": "This was our first and last visit.    Sadly, I have heard great things about Cracker Barrel. Me and my son usually stop somewhere for food after my mothers Chemo appointment, today we decided to get good well cooked flavorful food..... we did not get it.   I should have known to turn around when there was no hostess waiting to seat anyone and none of the cashiers said anything along the lines of \"your Hostess will be with you in a moment. sorry about the wait.\" After 5 minutes of waiting I gave them 1 more minute, being handicapped and letting my mother use my cane made standing and waiting much longer not an option. As I was getting ready to leave the hostess showed up.    We were seated and seen fairly quickly by the waiter (We never got his name) but by the end he seemed a tad over stretched and in over his head. We ordered our food, I got the roast beef with Yams, Carrots and Green beans. My son got a Medium 10 oz. Rib eye, Mashed potatoes with brown gravy, Mac and Cheese, and Corn. My son was annoyed that he could not order a Rare or Medium rare steak but the steak came out medium well as it was. The biscuits and corn bread came out fast, Corn Bread was good, but the biscuits were dry. Food came out VERY fast while we were still trying to eat our first biscuit/corn bread. I started to hear Gordan Ramsey in my head going \"Did they Microwave the food or have it all cooked and sitting under hear lamps?\" At the speed it came out I started to feel we made a mistake ...We did.    My \"Roast beef\" seemed more like a pot roast covered in brown gravy that had the consistency of Spam. The Sweet Yams were okay, Carrots had very little taste and about as mushy as baby food. The Green Beans looked like they had been pulsed in a blender and being just as flavorless and mushy as the carrots.   My sons Rib Eye was extremely tough, full of gristle, and cooked from medium well to well done in some spots. It was bland with very little to no seasoning. The piece he gave me took almost 3 minutes to chew and I had a hard time swallowing it due to it being dry. His sides were a joke. The Mac and cheese tasted like soggy noddles covered with cheese colored sauce. Neither one of us could taste actual cheese or cheese flavoring in it. The corn tasted like water, (no sweetness, Butter or even corn taste) I love corn and stole a scoop almost spitting it out. The Mashed potatoes, I did not risk but son said it was okay little chunks mixed in which he enjoys. A friend tried the sides 20 minutes after we got home and spit them out saying microwave meals taste better.   We did not eat everything and asked for take away boxes to reheat and season later. We sat for almost 10 minutes with him walking pass us multiple times without bring the bill or boxes. He finally got our boxes when he came towards our table with the drinks for the family behind us and saw me staring at him. He did a 180 and came right back with the bill and boxes offering us to-go drinks. We accepted the drinks since we only got one refill each after the first glass.   The girl at the register asked my son how was the food while he was paying. He said it was alright with a tone saying otherwise. She told him that a lot of customers have commented about the poor quality of the rib eye. If you get multiple comments or complaints about a product, fix the issue.   So, our first experience was a train wreak. We give restaurants one chance to show the quality. If our first time to a restaurant is poor we won't return. There are many other restaurants in the same plaza that are a lot better for the same price or cheaper. Famous Dave's BBQ is across the parking lot from them and 10 times better for about the same price.   If you like bland mushy food this is a good place to go. If not, stay away as they seem to be marketing to the older demographic. I could have gone to Denny's or Applebee's for cheaper better tasting food.  Edit: it's 3/1/19 the day after I have been sick all day in bed or bathroom I highly do not recommend this place I will be writing management once I feel better",

A good value as well, it was the lunch special for Wednesday.",

Had breakfast--my partner that the Sampler plate.  I had the Biscuit, Fried Apple and Hashbrown Casserole.  Everything just OK--not particularly good or special.   Wait staff very pleasant and efficient.  Just disappointed in the food.  Apples comparable to canned apple pie  filling, gravey-meh, scrambled eggs -eggs were premixed then cooked into little square-omelet style.  Hash brown casserole (goes by name of cheesy potatoes in some recipes) -had much better elsewhere.  Think I've tried Cracker Barrel enough times now that I don't need to go again.",

    "text": "Moving from NY to Las Vegas I have had to accept that some restaurants are jut not available. Cracker Barrel is one of them. When I get lucky enough to have time to drive to this location I take advantage of it!  As usual it was busy for a Sunday afternoon but I don;t mind much as I love to walk around the store. They sell old fashioned candies and very old country knick knacks such as various candles, stuffed animals and home decor. Since it is a restaurant they also sell cookbooks that range from 30 minute meals to slow cooker recipes. The patio at the entrance has rocking chairs for sale that patrons who are waiting for a table can use. There are also random board games strewn throughout the property, so you can sit and play a game of chess while you wait to be called.   Typically, when we visit Cracker Barrel we go straight for the pancakes but lately I have been obsessed with sourdough bread and they just happen to have sourdough bread french toast!  So delicious, not overly sweet like french toast can be. The bacon was crispy and the hot cocoa was topped with whipped cream. The only complaint I have on the food is the amount of eggs you get if you ask them to be scrambled, it really looks like they scrambled 1 little egg.   The prices are very reasonable and the service is always friendly and warm. I recommend stopping in if you happen to be so lucky as to pass by one!",

    "text": "I love Cracker Barrel!  When I lived in Flagstaff, I was a regular and now when I visit Chandler, I plan to be a regular at the Mesa Cracker Barrel.  Starting with the wooden rocking chairs on the front porch to the nostalgic candies and the Americana/Country gifts, Cracker Barrel will not disappoint in taking its guests back to a simpler time.  True country cooking is not meant to be rushed and neither should your experience at Cracker Barrel.  We had the pleasure of taking our 2 year old grandson out for his Cracker Barrel experience today.  This is a truly kid friendly restaurant which even includes country styled wooden booster seats, crayons, coloring sheets and a great kids menu with something for even the most discerning toddler's palate.   Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I don't believe that it should be restricted to the morning hours and neither does Cracker Barrel.  My absolute favorite breakfast at Cracker Barrel is the Sunrise Sampler which delivers more than enough food food for two, unless one of the two is your grandson who steals the bacon and sausage off your plate...The Sunrise Sample includes: two eggs, grits, sawmill gravy, home made biscuits, fried apples, hashbrown casserole, smoked sausage, ham and bacon.    Everything I've experience on the Cracker Barrel menu is incredible.  You must be sure to leave room for dessert.  The hot double chocolate fudge coca-cola cake with vanilla bean ice is an absolute to die for dessert.  There is lots of easy parking and CrackerBarrel is a stone's throw away from the Bass Pro Shop.  Need I say more...make it a full day outing!",

I love the old country feel to the place, with the rocking chairs out front, gift store in the front, and the decor once you get seated in the restaurant.  Service here has always been great, and our server on Saturday morning was funny, outgoing and made the experience worth while.  I went with the French toast as did my friend who joined me.  I went with coffee, and he stuck with water.  I love dining here, but I feel like everything on the menu is smothered in heart clogging pork gravy, and sometimes I find it hard to order since I don't eat pork.  Trying to get something without it seems impossible.  Yes, I can get substitutions, but what a huge pain it can be sometimes. I scour the menu for something that doesn't come with at least 3 variations of pork in the meal itself.  Overall, its a great place to grab a hearty breakfast, and I should try to come here more often.  Place is packed on weekend mornings, so if you want to beat the crowds, get here early!",

We had no complaints about service, or our meals. The prices were very reasonable in comparison to the quality and portions.   What was 5 stars was the dessert. OMG, baked in a dish with ice cream on top, to die for. I think next time I will skip breakfast and go right for that apple baked with ice cream on top heaven! For $3.99 I received the most delicious apple baked dessert ever! I will never forget that dessert and my hips will wear it for the next month without shame because it tasted that good!",

I got Mac & cheese ofc, broccoli cheese casserole ( daily special ), poached egges and wait for it, hush puppies! (Check pic) Yes I made them get me hash puppies! Oh and I made it clear to the waitress 10 times to make sure there's no meat in any of my food today. (Check my review for other Cracker Barrel where they sprinkle bacon in everything despite my requests)  The broccoli casserole tasted more like broccoli & cheese and less like a casserole. Hush puppies were bland and over fried. We had an excellent waitress though for a change. Hopefully I can try something else next time, oh wait they don't have anything else that I can try! Compared to places like lo-los for example, I feel like cracker barrels meatless sides aren't good enough",

My go to is Mama's Pancake Breakfast which comes with three awesome pancakes, two eggs and bacon and sausage.  A ton of food for $8.29.  The star deduction is because my eggs were over cooked tonight, but I didn't complain as I was hungry and in a hurry.  My server Lauren was awesome, friendly, personable, great smile.  She noticed that my eggs were over cooked and insisted on bringing me new one's, but I wouldn't let her.  I genuinely appreciate her attention to detail, but again was in a hurry.  Great Place, fantastic gift shop, always a pleasure for me anyway, to dine here!  Management at this location seems pretty solid, and as a former restaurateur always catches my eye!",

Having the check out for your meal/gift shop plus host checking is ridiculous when you have elderly, kids and individuals needing to wheel/crutch exit the restaurant in the same area. Too much traffic!!",

    "text": "Yes!  I finally got to try a Cracker Barrel!  When I first entered the store, I already knew this was my kinda place.  Touristy and homey at the same time.  I love browsing through gift shops and boutiques when I'm out of town.  As for the restaurant part of it, I knew nothing could be worse than what I had the day before at the Original Pancake House (unless we went to Denny's), so I was looking forward to a REAL breakfast.  I was not disappointed!  I had the chicken fried steak, eggs, biscuits and gravy, and hashbrown casserole.  Everything was delicious and about $8-$9/plate.  Lots of good food for under $10!    Service was extremely enjoyable, attentive, and friendly.  Loved the whole country atmosphere of the place.  We sat in their famous rocking chairs at a checkerboard table and played a game while we waited for our food.    California needs a Cracker Barrel!",

Chicken was also underseasoned by a lot. Cucumbers in salad soggy and translucent.  Apparently kitchen can't identify when produce is on the fritz, which is a concern for me.  Also bad spots on my steamed broccoli. Portion size was weak!  Thought prices were good until I saw amount of food. Subpar service.  Manager did comp pork chop, an appropriate response. Take yourself to Black Bear Diner, where portions are big, same price.  Similar all American type dining experience and good food.",

Here's what I've had and how I feel:  Biscuits & Gravy: Delicious. Hashbrown Casserole: Also delicious. Fried Apples: Taste like your typical fried apples, which means it's delicious. Country Fried Steak: Cooked well, crispy, and the added gravy makes the dish Country Fried Chicken: Just as good as the country fried steak Eggs: I mean, eggs are eggs. Just order them how you like.  Steak: Cooked well. I'm picky with my steak so the fact that we paid the cheap price for this steak and I enjoyed it, means something.  Apple cider in a Frozen mug: Get this EVERYTIME. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's refreshing and works great with any meal.  Disclaimer: I may have been hungover or beyond ravenous upon my visits here, so this review may be a bit exaggerated.  All in all, it's a great, decently priced breakfast spot.",

My SIL frequents this location and advised that the desired stuffed animals were indeed in stock here.   Begrudgingly, we headed over to the 'Country Store' side of this chain, Sysco-to-table sourced restaurant. They did have the most extensive selection of Beanie Boos we have seen, and were offering a \"buy two, get one 50% off\" special.   Because of the special, we purchased more than two, receiving excellent customer service from a girl who noticed us searching, she checked the computer and brought the wayward \"Tuffy\" to us from the stockroom. We were rockstars in the eyes of our niece at her party, but the tea set we purchased at a locally owned \"paint your own pottery\" shop made us feel better as educated and socially conscious consumers.   Even the cashier was very friendly, thanking us for our visit and inquiring if we found everything ok. But, none of this pleasantry is enough to make me patronize this chain which discriminates against basic human rights whilst billing itself as \"All American\" = duplicitous at best. Two stars are for the helpful associate and friendly cashier.  * extensive inventory of Beanie Boos in all sizes *",

He was casually informative, friendly, he refilled our glasses before we noticed they were getting low, he checked on us a couple of times and made sure to offer us dessert. BUT when I asked for a Cherry Coke, he said they don't have that and have no grenadine, he tilted his head to the side and with a wink offered to make me a Raspberry Coke. Darius brought it to me with our bread and it looked as unassuming as my girlfriend's standard Coke but one cautious sip in and I'm now hooked. My meal was made with this fruity syrup infused lovely. So, if not for Darius's personality and the Raspberry Coke I'd have almost nothing nice to say about our meal.     The buttermilk biscuits were burnt, the only thing caesar about our salad was the dressing and maybe the cheese. My grits were cold and not cooked right, the noodles of the Mac n cheese were overcooked and it was about cold and our mashed potatoes (I wanted baked potato but they were out) with gravy were about cold and under seasoned. But the ribeye was pretty good, although also about cold. Everything was served fairly quickly, so we weren't sure how everything was hot warm or hot.",

After being called to be seated we had to weave around aisle's to locate the hostess stand hidden behind aisle's of merchandise. If they dont want to give ip precious space by the hostess stamd maybe lay down arrows pointing towards line or a stand.  There are no markers ro distinguish where the line starts and ends. The price and value for what you get was awsome. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Way too loud for us so ne prepared. Recommend you try this place at least once.",

Let's start with there always being a 20+ minute wait. Then you have to dodge snowbirds, children and merchandise in the hoarder-style, overfilled Country Store. I feel like I'm in Pac man trying to get to breakfast while being blocked by ghosts and Yankee candle displays.   I get to my table, which have the hardest, wobbly wooden chairs ever. The tables have so much junk on top we can never fit the food (or beat the peg game). My drink is slow to get refilled, and I've rarely had a visit when something in the order is not missing. And for crying out loud, I want the breakfast menu. Does anyone in their right mind want the dinner menu here?  Then after your meal, you reverse your way through the maze to pay your bill. Holy moly people, take my money so I can get the rock out of here! The ghosts are chasing me again, this time out to the parking lot where a hundred snowbirds impatiently wait on the walk in rocking chairs with their oxygen tanks, playing checkers.",

    "text": "Was with my besty and she said lets grab lunch, my treat and you don't have to put out, I said girl I am their!! Haha but no really that's how the conversation went down.  She loves Cracker Barrel and I hadn't been in a while so I was excited to go!  We had gone to a movie 1st before we ate so by the time we got there we were starving. We made our way up to the hostess and I guess she could tell we were starving and ushered us to our seats quickly.   Then we were greeted by our server Mathew, who ladies he is quite the cutie, some small talk went down and movies were discussed told why yes I have seen The Hobbit, it was all the buzz. He got a gleam in his eye and he started riddling me this and riddling me that and then left to get the drinks we ordered. While he was gone I got a.d.d and forget he had just riddled me. He brought the drinks back and was expecting an answer, but I had to confess I already forgot what the exact riddle was.    Yes, that's really how it happened, then Mathew said oh ladies this really isn't my table, my friend Brandon will be here to be taking over .So Brandon appeared and took our order, the country lovin girl inside me wanted something smothered in gravy and I saw they had Chicken Fried Chicken with gravy! And I paired it up with a sweet potato, mac & cheese and hash brown casserole. I have to say I really dug the sweet potato, it was perfect, the mac & cheese was delsih and couldn't get enough of the hash brown casserole, but what made me a little sad was there was barley any gravy smothering my chicken fried chicken, but man that chicken was good!  I quickly got over being saddened by the missing gravy and ordered me a double chocolate fudge coca cola cake,,,,oooooooommmmmmmmmmgggggggggggggg that cake is sooooo gooooooddddd!!!!   I have to say for country home-style cooking and lil country store Cracker Barrel is the place to be!",

    "text": "1: Never order an omelete at cracker barrel.  I have been to many cracker barrels growing up, this by far is my least favorite location. It started with me asking the host if they make omeletes at their location. \"Of course!\" she says. We proceed to sit down and be greated by our waitress, I ask for an omelete with three fixins (four if you count cheese). \"I willl see what they can do\" she says, so I ask \"If its a problem I can order something else\", she says \"No we can do it!\". I receive my plate and see what looks like cheese on a flat egg that was folded with fixings just placed in inside, not melted with the cheese and not part or in the egg. I eat because Im starving and think to myself \"Not what I wanted but I will make due\". I later receive the bill, each fixin was almost two dollars on a three egg omelete, this was mushroom, bacon, brocolli, and cheese. Everything but the cheese was charged as a full side dish. I go to pay, no one at the register, for at least 7 mins,however many of the coworkers chatting away. Finally someone comes up to the register, \"How did you enjoy your meal?\" she asks. \"Eh, it was ok\", I say. Then a shorter woman who appears to be a manager approaches from my left asking \"Was something bad about your meal?\" I explain my meal to her and she responds \"Well omeletes are not on the menu, but at least they tried to customize an order for you \" I explain about the hostess and no response. Just a thick air of tension as my girlfriend and I leave.Never again.",

It takes alot of food to fill my son's stomach but he had the pancake breakfast and finished every crumb, said he couldn't eat another bite. Brionna was our server, we never had to ask for anything, except for the yummy apple butter given upon request. My boy had never tried it, imagine that! He'll remember to ask for it now, loved it! I had the meatloaf sandwich, so good and cooked to perfection! Of course made a pit stop in the shop and picked up the cutest coffee cup at a great bargain!  The perfect way to spend a day! Great food and great company!",

He should have been giving free dessert to everyone  in the restaurant from what I saw.

    "text": "I don't normally review \"chains\" and this is technically a chain however, there are none of these in California.  Let's see, here's a story, a few years ago I became enamored with this place called Cracker Barrel.  I had heard so much about it and I love anything Southern so it was my goal to go to one of these for several years. I had been in Florida, Texas and AZ before all states that have a CB but unfortunately never got the opportunity to go to one.  So when I found out I'd be coming to Arizona this past weekend, the first thing I did was look up to see where the nearest Cracker Barrel was going to be. Lucky for me there was one very close to where we were staying so I told my friend that we HAD to go eat there at some point in the weekend.  That point was this past Sunday for breakfast.  I was a bit nervous because I had hyped CB for so many years that I hoped it lived up to it.  My friend even made fun of me when I told her she was helping to make one of my \"dreams come True\" (a little over dramatic yes but whatever).  Well I can safely say that once we were done with our meal she bit her tongue on what she said to me and she bit it hard.  We were seated pretty quickly for a Sunday morning, our server was very nice and he won extra points with us because he showed us his wallet which was an old California Angels wallet (we were in AZ because of Spring Training).  Everything on the menu looked so good but I finally settled on the French Toast Breakfast w/blackberry topping (it came with eggs and bacon as well).  My friend couldn't decide what she wanted but she knew she wanted have the hashbrown casserole.  Our waiter recommended something that was off the menu for her and it was perfect 3 pancakes, hashbrown casserole, bacon and sausage.  When our food came out our eyes just lit up.  My french toast was AMAZING.  The tartness from the blackberry just made the combination so so good. The bacon was also very crispy just the way I like it.  The showstopper though had to be the hashbrown casserole.  My friend had me try it and it was seriously unlike anything I had ever tasted before.  We're trying to recreate this ourselves.  The bill wasn't bad at all for the amount of food you got (it was under $8 per plate) definitely worth it. Like I said it definitely lived up to my own hype.  With that said: Dear Cracker Barrel, please franchise to southern California please please pretty please!! Luckily for us we are going back to AZ at the end of the month and we have already decided we are stopping here again!",

When you step onto the restaurant's \"porch\" and see a whole row of new wooden rocking chairs,\"gently used\" rockers, and a rocking chair wind chime, all laid out as if they were cars at a car dealership, they mean business with their down-home country atmosphere!  The food itself, just OK.  We went with a friend who used to be in the service industry who said that after inspecting the meals we got, most of the items here were mass-produced, and either came from a can or were previously frozen and shipped here.  I tried the breakfast combo that came with eggs, turkey sausage, grits, and hash brown casserole.  They were all decent, not exceedingly superb, but not bad.  The gravy on the biscuits was pretty bland though. As for drinks, the peach sweet tea here is nice, it's not overly sweet, and is actually made with Splenda, while the coffee, just OK, nothing to write home about.",

I'm a west coast girl so I've never heard of this place before until I saw it on my way to Home Depot that is in the same area.  I had asked a friend about it and he swore it had the best breakfast he's ever had.  Clearly he's never been to Black Bear Diner!  Went on a Sunday...biiiig mistake.  As we were waiting to be seated, my friend and I realized we weren't the following...  a) religious enough (it was Sunday, so I'll cut some slack on that) b) old enough c) tacky enough d) cranky enough  My eyes.  OMYEYES! I was blinded by the sequins and dazzled from the home bedazzled shirts.  OMYEYES! I swear, everyone was over 60 and complaining about their meals. I was surrounded by senior citizens who bitched and complained then threatened to NOT pay for their meals.  Personally, I felt like they were scamming the place. I know customer service is a thankless job, but sometimes customers are way too cheap and shouldn't be eating out.  Breakfast wasn't so bad, but I found it incredibly bland and laden with salt. Within an hour of eating there I was *parched*. Their \"sourdough\" pancakes didn't remind me of sourdough in the slightest. Their scrambled eggs seemed to have been made from liquid eggs, solidifying my belief that I'm too young for this establishment. The only True highlight were the corn muffins that were brought out while we waiting.  YUM.  I felt so cheap and tacky walking through Home Depot after while guzzling 4 bottles of water.  Yes, I paid for them. The fluid retention from my salt intake was enough to make me think they had some MSG in their food.  Long review short? If you like salty food and cantankerous seniors, this place is for you.",

    "text": "LOVE this place! I first had it in Nashville and when I saw that there were Cracker Barrel's in Phoenix, I almost did back flips. They offer good food, for great prices. This is comfort food, people, Mama's home cooking kind of food, probably made with Crisco and coffee that only needs 2 creams and a sugar. I appreciate the \"store\" part as it keeps me from trying to sit with strangers in my haste to eat.",

    "text": "My wife had never gone here until I took her. Me having lived in Florida and Louisiana I love this kinda home cooking that you don't get really anywhere else here in the valley. I LOVE the chicken and dumplings! They are the best. My wife likes the fried shrimp and chicken fried steak. The Mac n' cheese, the Fried Okra and the cheesy potatoes are my favorite sides. Their breakfast puts the boots to any other similar breakfast place. The pancakes are amazing, the bacon is awesome, the waffles are the best.  Plus on top of the amazing food you get to roam the Country Store while you wait or after your meal. Tons of old skool candy treats, and a bunch of stuff you would never buy but is fun to look at :) I love going to Cracker Barrel any time and have never been to a bad one!",

    "text": "my father and I went there for breakfast.  The place was empty except for two tables.  My dad ordered his regular oatmeal with two corn muffins.  how can you go wrong with oatmeal, well instead of serving milk with the oatmeal they served those little tiny containers of half and half the ones which go with the coffee.  I ordered the multi-grain pancakes which came out under cooked and pasty, sent them back.  The next order or multi-grain pancakes came out way over cooked and dry like card board, sent them back. Then the manager came out and said all the multi-grain and wheat pancakes are always dry, I said they should put that on the menu - multi-grain pancakes always dry.  Then I tried the blueberry pancakes, well it must not have been a pancake day as the blueberry pancakes tasted funny, all the blueberries were right in the middle of the pancakes and they too were dry and pasty.  The server was not much help saying things which contradicted the manager.  Can't anyone get an honest answer when they ask questions about the food.",

They give you hearty helpings of fantastic comfort food, have a great homey atmosphere and a cute store with all kinds of seasonal and novelty items. Their lunch and dinner meals are my favorite but breakfast is good too.",

    "text": "Lunch today was my first time at the Cracker Barrel, and probably my last.  I had their combination plate, featuring a slice of ham, chicken and dumplings, and meatloaf.  The meatloaf was good, the ham OK, and the dumplings a strangely gelatenous texture.  Cut up white chicken accompanied the dumplings.  In their defense, one of my dining companions said her mom used to make them the same way, but I like my dumplings light and fluffy.  Nothing was served hot, barely past warm.  No beer and wine offered at all, but I was there for lunch, so not a big deal.  The service was great, and everyone friendly, which is why I bumped up the rating from a 2 to a 3.  I guess it's a good value for the money though (my plate was around $8 or $9), if you're not too picky about your food.",

    "text": "So, coming from the Midwest, I am VERY familiar with Cracker Barrel. Well, I don't really know what happened to good ole' home style cooking we were so use too. We were in AZ last week for the entire week. We live in CA now so, we had been looking forward to going to CB for a whole month. Well, I can say that we will never go to CB again! That's a HUGE statement for us to say because we raised our kids going to CB since they were small. Of course when we moved to CA we missed it even more. It's just not the same anymore. The food was terrible, portions smaller, service was not the same. It just doesn't feel like home anymore. It makes us very sad that CB changed so much since we were there 3 years ago. We visited the same CB in Mesa 3 years ago. On our way to AZ we stopped by another CB in Buckeye and the service and food was the same as Mesa...sad. Sorry CB you have lost long time customers.",

Super good! Very home cooked and country style breakfast. Service was good and out lady was sweet. The country store that is in front is way cool. Lots of fun things to look at! I bought the cutest cupcake dress for my neice! Lots of old school candies as well.",
