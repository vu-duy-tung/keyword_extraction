They have expanded their seating with the outdoor area and taking over the adjacent place which I thought was an old coffee house called Jamaica something or other.  Anyway, service was fair, food was good, and prices were a bit mixed - some items seemed priced about normal but others were a couple bucks high.    Don't care for their no-substitution policy since they do their entrees and sandwiches a little different than most other falafel places.",

I would estimate that the schwarma has about 2 ounces of meat. I felt completely taken advantage of. I've never complained about portions before but I told our waitress that the portions were a total rip off. She was very nice and added some more hummus but even counting that, i think it was still very little for $6 hummus appetizer.  Ignore the good reviews, those were before the new cheapskate owner. Its obvious they are targeting tourists with high prices and low portion to get every penny out of them since they likely wont return anyway.  The new owner is obviously not just cheaping on the food, one poor girl worked the takeout section, the bar, and the restaurant. As far as I can tell she was the only one working on a Sunday at 1pm.  However, she was very nice and did the best she could. She was the only reason they got 1 star.",

She then opened the cash register, pointed to the empty change drawer and bluntly said \"we dont deal with change.\" I said ok but thought it was really an obnoxious practice as a ploy to get  tips on the to go food...If I had any inclination to throw her a tip it would have been more than the 52 cents she weaseled so she's screwing herself in the long run. Not to mention that I found it so unprofessional that it left a bad taste in my mouth along with the baba.",

I stopped in for what I thought would be a quick carry-out order late afternoon / early evening on a Saturday...   I skimmed the menu that was posted outside and walked in.  I recall hearing positive things about this place and figured it would be perfect for what I was looking for - a quick and somewhat healthy option to take home and eat quickly as I got ready for my night out.  Was that the case?  Yes and no.  I was not sure which side to go in to order from... when I walked in, the one lady working there acknowledged me but didn't return to take my order for a good ten minutes.  Just as I was getting ready to leave, she apologized, but I was getting antsy and annoyed.  I placed my order and told her I'd wait for it... A greek salad and a vegetarian appetizer plate.  Neither the salad or the app plate was the best I've had.  They were both fine.  I liked the combo of tabbouleh, hummus, baba ghanoush, grape leaves, and falafel... and luckily Jared helped me to eat it all as it was a lot of food.  It was more than $20 once I added a bottle of water though.  More expensive than I would've guessed.  Will I rush back?  Probably not?  Will I return?  Possibly... not a bad option for Middle Eastern cuisine - and perhaps it's better if you eat in on a night when they have belly dancers or something?!  I'll update if and when I experience that.",

    "text": "The food is bomb. Atomic style.   Ok, it's not spicy at all, but it is freaking delicious.  I had one hell of a goose chase trying to find some chinese food on this weeknight. It's past 9PM on a Monday, and I can't find anything decent. It's Scottsdale, so my only choices are: Panda Express in Mesa, Jimmy Woo's (no thanks, eww), or go hungry. I settled, and drove to KFC thinking that if I was going to settle for something other than Chinese, I could get a double down, and try and go all suicidal.   Then KFC let me down by forcing me to wait 10 minutes because all their filets were frozen. Eff that noise. I drove around aimlessly and somehow stumbled upon Pita House. It was like a sight for sore eyes.  I've lived in Scottsdale for just over a year. I've been out and about in the area quite a bit, but for some reason I've never actually been to the Pita House. Probably because it does look a little weird.   I guess I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, because this place was awesome.  Tonight, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with an extra chicken skewer. It came with a side salad. I was pleasantly surprised to find a very thick garlic sauce (very similar to the one at Zankou Chicken in LA, see my review). Amazing. So garlicky, citrusy, and perfect.  The chicken was moist and juicy. The kind that makes you want to put your mouth all up in it. Mmm hmm. Yeah. It's very nice.  My meal was about 10 bucks. I devoured everything set in front of me.   If you are into Hookah, they have hookah specials from 4-9, and also, some sort of lunch special for Gyros.  If I wasn't moving away, I'd be here more often.  Next time I am in Scottsdale, I will eat here, and grab some Falafel. Seems like people like it.  Lastly, the staff seems very nice. The guy who helped me (I think he was the owner) was super cool and friendly.",

Dolmades or grape leaves dish was so-so. Finally, gyros isn't fresh off the spit as it should be for the best taste and quality. Based on taste and the identical cuts of each strip of gyros (only 4 measly slices for a $13 plate), I was able to tell the gyros was prepackaged and most likely frozen. Everything was edible at least, but far from what it could be and every item is overpriced due to the size and/or quality.

While visiting Scottsdale, we wanted to pay homage to our ancestry and smoke some hookah. After dinner at RA sushi, we ended up walking over for what we thought would be an hour smoke sesh before heading to the W to party. We were there for 5 hours! The vibe was awesome... yes, they serve food, but the hookah patio is where its at. They've got lights for ambiance, misters out of necessity, and music blaring and a belly dancer for entertainment.   We ended up going back the next night to try the food and continue to smoke our lungs into oblivion. Yeah, you read that right... 2 nights in a row. Did I mention we were only in Scottsdale for 2 nights? And we specifically stayed at the W with intentions of partying our asses off.   What we ordered:  Both nights: Chocolate + Mint Hookah... HANDS DOWN the best flavor hookah I've ever smoked!! Tasted like Mint Chocolate chip ice cream. Hells yes.   Mixed Fruit: Good flavor... very smooth, but a hint of menthol at the end.   Blueberry + Mixed Melon: Yes! God yes! Tasted like bubble gum.   Vegetarian Appetizer plate: Babaganouj was outstanding. The bread was warm and fresh.   Falafel sandwich: YUM! The falafel was light and not fried to Sh*t. Mmm, it was good. This was heaven in a pita.   The people made this place! We pretty much made BFF's with the staff and owner. They took SUCH good care of us. We had fresh coals every 5 minutes - that's attentive!   I thought Scottsdale was alright. Worth a repeat visit? Probably not. Then I found this place. I'll be back just for the Pita house!",

I was wrong. I received maybe... A handful of rice on the side and I had already paid to upgrade my salad to a fatoush... In reality I was disappointed. It was basically a unraveled shawarma sandwich with non of the greens inside and a handful of rice. Portion size 2/5.  Lastly they didn't seem to fond of the fact that we used Groupon.. We were told something else other than what we had purchased on Groupon so it wasn't cool at all. For example on Groupon we bought 30.00$ value meal for 16.00 whereas when we got there we were told they wouldn't honor it... And in fact we would have to spend 50.00$  and they would knock it off.

I think pita house is the only place in Scottsdale with comfy out door seating and that is probably the only positive thing about the place. If I can rate it no stars at all I truly would. This place charges for water. Has terrible nasty hot zero flavored hookah. Very very loud speakers placed directly behind the customers which leaves no room for anyone to talk or socialize. And of course terrible service. They come by every 30 minutes and bring out incorrect orders at times they forget to bring out the order all together. The worst part of all our visits when we go is the next day. When we check our online banking. Pita house over charges and this has been done to multiple people in our group and on multiple occasions. They over charge or double charge and when you call and confront them about this issue they say they never done this before and what you are saying is False. So what ends up being done is the payment has to be disputed with the bank. This has not just happened once or twice to the same person. This has happened close to every single visit to multiple different people. Check your transactions especially for this establishment every time because they seem to generously tip themselves on your behalf. Be careful.",

We went there, set down and we didn't have anyone come to our table for at least 15 mins! Finally the waiter arrived, took our order ( I ordered the classic gyro with fries, and my boyfriend ordered the same thing but chose salad instead) . When we received the food they both had salad, no fries! So I kindly asked for the fries that I ordered and the waiter apologized and said they will be right out. However, he charged me additional $$ just for the fries ( they were part of the meal!!!)  Anyways, I won't be returning here after tonight!!! It seemed like no one was there to actually work!",

Today I had the horrifying experience of showing up to pick up my take-out order and there were two credit cards belonging to other customers just lying at the front counter unattended. I was left alone with them for over two minutes and when someone came to help me, they asked a server who they belong to. I could have swiped them and no one would have known. I'm terribly alarmed at this restaurants lack of concern for other people's credit cards. I will NEVER use a credit card here after what I saw today. In fact, not sure I'll return as I am so upset about it. Totally despicable behavior and ignorance.",

    "text": "Midnight on a Friday night and this place was slammed. Might have been overflow from the nearby bars because it was wall-to-wall crowds at the inside register and on the patio wrapping around towards the back. My first impression formed based on the number of patrons who appeared middle eastern. The group sitting on patio to our left were speaking Greek. So, perhaps the food and the hookah reflected the same authenticity?  The food was OK. We split the regular hummus that came with assorted pita bread and veggies. It tasted average store-bought. Though it didn't knock our socks off, hummus is a wonderful (healthier) alternative to your standard late night drunken, fourth-meal, Scottsdale snack. My friend ordered a regular gyro and fries. It looked pretty good and the fries were also average tasting.  We ordered the blue mist hookah flavor and a round of Coors Light. The beers came in bottles - I think draft would be a nice touch. The hookah flavor was great and had a solid kick. I was impressed by how long it lasted between 3 people. We noticed the hookah lacked a good clearing mechanism, so the smoke turned stale towards the end. The hoses had a fancy looking mouthpiece to them that we all enjoyed.  Overall, I recommend Pita House as a hookah patio. There aren't many in the area, especially ones within decent walking distance to bars and restaurants. I've heard Oasis is good too. If you're looking for Greek or Mediterranean food, it's not top notch, but it may be one of few options nearby. It's a great fall-back and easy-to-spot location when you need it.",

    "text": "Went here last week with a friend. The place was decent and the food was fairly good. I got the chicken shawarma pita, and it came with a salad which was a really good vinaigrette dressing on it. The problem I have with this place is one that multiple others have mentioned, is that YOU GET CHARGED FOR WATER. On weekends they do not give water, except for bottles, and there's a $2 charge for it, the same as iced tea. This place would easily be 4 stars if it wasn't for that, but they lose one just for that oddity. Though, I have been to a few Mediterranean restaurants in the past that have done this, I still don't know how they can get away with it.  When we were there, there was one man sitting by himself on his computer smoking hookah (maybe eating as well?) and another man who seemed to be a friend of family member of the owners, because he was just sitting there watching old middle eastern television and had people coming and going talking to him. I'm not sure how this place stays in business.",

It's a simple Greek menu, with plenty of options for vegetarians like myself.  I usually get a pita sandwich with a side salad instead of fries, but last night I splurged and got the Vegetarian Platter.  For $10, you get basically 2 meals worth of food - good for sharing or in my usual case, being a total fatass and eating it (nearly) all.  The pita included with the Veg platter is notably thinner than traditional pita bread, but I actually prefer it (honestly, it almost seems like grilled tortillas but I know that's not right).  This way, you can save on the carbs as you scoop up some delicious baba and hummus.  The falafel here is much crispier than I've had anywhere else...and I love it!  Service is friendly and quick. Packaging for to-go orders has always been adequate...no spills on the drive home for me!  Bonus: parking is plentiful in the adjacent lot, and you can sit on the cozy patio while you wait for your order to be prepared!",

Most don't know how to make gin and tonic and it takes close to an hour of continuously asking to get your drink. Bootleg vodka like Kamchatcka is a separate thing all together.  VIP service means getting physically assaulted by staff and the owners doing nothing about it.  And talk about being overcharged and liable for other people's drinks. It happens all the time because the severs are like a bunch of special ed kids running around tripping over their egos too lazy to give a damn.  STAY FAR FAR AWAY!

We came here around 10pm on a Saturday, service was horrible, hookah was harsh and nobody cared enough to fix it even though we asked multiple times, and their \"cocktails\" tasted terrible and watered down. Their bathrooms were absolutely disgusting and filthy. They had no free tap water!! How is that even legal? And there was a child that was sitting at the table right next to us, a CHILD in an establishment where everyone is smoking hookah. So wrong, and unacceptable,  and again...illegal. We almost walked out without paying because everything was so bad and illegal and NOBODY WAS BRINGING US A CHECK AFTER WE ASKED FOR IT. We ended up walking to the register ourselves in order to pay. Bottom line, if you're not of the same culture, you're not going to get any type of customer service.  It's nonexistent. Don't go to this shady, horrible, gross, and illegal place.",

I respect the owner willing to reach out and address individual customer complaints. This shows me that he is open minded and willing to take criticism and do what needs to be done in order to address it.  Since then I have been back three times, and I am happy to say that each of those experiences demonstrated that what he promised (that the staff has been trained and revamped) is indeed what he has been looking forward to. I went during the day and during the evening, and each time I was there, the staff was friendly and attentive, and willing to take initiative to please their customers.  I'm updating my review to four stars because most of all, I respect that Rashad the owner was willing to address customer concerns, and has shown the care for his business.  I plan on visiting in the future, and I hope this trend continues! Thanks to Rashad and his staff for a pleasant experience.",

Instead of big balls of it, there were smaller pieces which meant more crispy bits. Ok by me! It lent a nice texture to the hummus/tahini/pita. The pita was nice and soft and chewy contrary to other reviews I glanced over. The side salad left a bit to be desired- just iceberg lettuce with a light dressing. If you get tap water, they bring you a HUGE cup of it. Like, Big Gulp-style.  We took advantage of the nice weather (with a breeze!) and stayed and ate outside. Not particularly impressive since it's basically in a parking lot, but I had my back to it, and they seem to be doing the best they can with what they've got.",

The salad had little more than iceberg and romaine lettuce mixed with some large slices of tasteless tomatoes, an olive and a few slivers of onion. The dressing was not very good either.  The meat on the gyro was overcooked, processed slabs (I expect they them packaged frozen) and there was hardly any sauce or anything else in the wrap to balance the meat taste.  It was a to go order and I just ate some of it to curb my hunger, I was too tired from a very long day to go back. They may have made adjustments to the food if I was dinning there. But really it never should have left the kitchen in such condition if that wasn't how they usually serve it.  If this place was in Southern California, it wouldn't last 5 minutes with this quality Med food.",

First off, let's get some real lettuce on a salad, f*** this iceberg crap. And how about some veggies? (minus half a star).  Now the good. The falafel pita was damn good! Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside and tons of flavor. The hummus on top completed it. All that served in a pita that was thinner and had a little bit of a crisp to it was tasty. The rice was delicious as well; simple white rice with good seasoning and cooked perfectly.   Overall I will be going back, though I may call ahead to minimize the wait.",

Seating is only available outside, and chairs are very uncomfortable for extended sitting - which is ironic considering the Pita House is also a Hookah Joint.  The place has a very hip vibe, which the downtempo and house beats create through Pita's sound system.  Misters keep the patio cool, but soaked.    Service was fast and friendly, even our host (or manager?) stopped by the table to see how we were enjoying the food.    Food is typical Mediterranean/Middle Eastern kafta, gyros, greek salads, and baba ghanoush.  Sampled three different meat dishes including kafta kebabs, chicken skewers, and beef skewers.  All were very dry and overcooked - flavors were there, however.  Overall, I think this is a good place for late night eats - meeting the gang for some Hookah before heading out to the clubs, but certainly not for a comfortable and delectable dining experience.",

It took quite a while to even get my glass of water, and longer for the food to come. There isn't really any indoor seating, but the patio is nice (if not a bit chilly at night. I assume it's a bit roasting in the summer).  The food itself? Good.  It didn't taste bad, or make me want to leave, but it wasn't mouth watering good.  So-so.  Will I be back? Probably.

After almost an hour, she walked up to us and asked if we had gotten our food. Um, no, we had an empty table!! We assumed she was busy, but obviously she didn't enter the order. It was very upsetting. My daughters and I weren't smoking hooka, maybe that's why she gave more attention to the men that were. It's too bad. This place was really good at one point. Sad to see it in the gutter.",

We asked for our hookah to be fixed, nobody came over to fix it within the 2 hours we were there. When asked for a check, nobody brought a check, we had to physically go up there and pay ourselves after waiting for 30 mins. But WORST OF ALL, there was a TODDLER at the table right next to us. How can a toddler be allowed in an 18+ establishment???? I felt uncomfortable smoking and blowing smoke in a space where a child is sitting right next to me. Pretty sure that's illegal. This place needs to be shut down ASAP, it seemed to be breaking more than 1 law. No free tap water??? Ridiculous and unheard of. To top it all off, they automatically added a $10 tip to the overall bill. Please don't go here and don't give them any more business.",

The babaganoush and dolmades were really good!   However, the shawarma sandwich was supposed to include beef and chicken; it only contained beef. The beef was tough and had a lot of connective tissue and gristles. The pita quarters served with the babaganoush was very thin and stale, unlike the good pita bread on the sandwich.   I had hoped Pita House would be good because we love Middle Eastern food and it's located only 2 blocks from where we live. My wife liked it overall, but she agreed with my criticisms of the food.   I'm sorry to say I'm not likely to go back to Pita House.",

I waited an additional 15 minuets for my food, I expected it to be piping hot but that was not the case. The fries where cold enough for my 2 year old to eat right away and the beef was room temperature as well. As for my favorite part of any Middle Eastern meal- the tzatziki, was also a fail. The consistency was great but it lacked in flavor.  I remember coming here when I was younger for the hookah, and I liked the food. But I guess the hookah made it seem better than it actually was",

    "text": "Had lunch here early afternoon.  From the outside you are fooled a bit as this establishment is housed in the \"Old Town Pueblo\" looking building next to a tattoo place and Schlotzsky's.  You are fooled into thinking this might be a half-ass run pita joint.  However, the only fooling once you step inside is the faux old world walls and fixtures; so Vegas-ish.  I did notice a windex smell upon entering.  I took that as a good thing vs. a bad thing although it was a little nasty to waff.  Otherwise this place is pretty authentic Lebanese.  I had the hummus appetizer along with the chicken kabob sandwich, both were yummy.  I always get a little shy trying foreign food in the desert cause it always seems like the stuff is a day or two old, but the stuff looked fresh and tasted yummy.  The place was playing some Arabic music and had some Bollywood looking movie on the two plasma screens and although our waitress was from Venezuela, she played and sounded the Lebanese part pretty good.  She apologized for taking too long to bring out our bill, but I was having such a good convo with my friend that I told her 'no worries'.  I noticed that they do offer hookah and belly dancing on the weekends.  They have a little VIP nook inside and an average size patio outside.  You can sit down if you walk in the back door or order take-out from the front door.  + + +'s: fairly ethnic feel, fresh lunch food, clean, several areas to eat (inside, outside, VIP, take-out), friendly service  - - - 's: faux materials (we all know it's fake, just paint it mediterranean blue or something), tone down on the clean smell  In sum, if you are looking for a bit of ethnic flair with decent food and a variety of seating choices, this is your place.  If you are looking for upscale mediterranean, look elsewhere.",

Or maybe I didn't measure up, and was being encouraged not to include Pita House in my lunch rotation.  About halfway through my visit, I knew this was a one-time visit.  All the signs were piling up.  I entered the take out section and was led to the dining area.  Obviously a first timer, the waitress seemed bemused by my newness and uncompelled to offer any assistance.  Maybe she knew I wasn't returning before I did.  I felt like I was being marked for sides, drinks, and up sales rather than being welcomed.  By the time the food came, I had already decided not to return unless it was the best lunch ever and the meal was between okay and good, but closer to good.  There are so few places where rudeness is part of the charm of the place.  It is just so hard to pull off.  I had the chicken shawarma.  The chicken cubes were juicy, and the tahini sauce was good, but lacking.  On the plus side, there doesn't seem to be a shortage of restaurants in downtown Scottsdale.  Next!!",

I've spent more time waiting at the McDonald's drive-thru; I was probably in and out of there in 5-7 minutes.  The food was tasty - pita appeared fresh out of the oven (I don't know if it actually was), chicken was juicy & flavorful, and veggies were fresh.  Their pitas/sandwiches come with a side salad that constists of pretty much just shredded lettuce and dressing, but I won't knock it since I ate all of it.   I wish their portions were a little bigger for what I paid, but all in all, a good experience.  I'll probably be back next time I'm craving Mediterranean food in a hurry, because it definitinely hit the spot.",

The lettuce always tastes like bagged cheapo stuff, though, and they only have bottled drinks-- no brewed iced tea or anything fancy. The restaurant is really small- with only three or four tables inside in the air conditioning. They have outdoor seating with misters, but I personally really hate sitting under misters. They have waitstaff, er ONE server, who double as a counter server, so it can be slow, but they are always very friendly. All and all, this restaurant is OK. I work close, so it's kind of nice to go here as a change of pace, but not on any sort of regular basis or anything.  Just a funny note: I did spellcheck here on <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a>, and they suggested \"testis\" for \"tzatziki.\" ha!",

The staff is friendly, and service is pretty quick.  I prefer a carry out or alfresco dining, as sometimes they overdo the cleaning chemicals in the inside seating area.   The area is a vast wasteland of tourist trap shops and crap food, so lets just say this place is an oasis of sorts.",

There was garbage, literally garbage, all over the floor by our table. The nice waitress said they hadn't cleaned up from the night before. She swept up while we waited for our order, but we still sat next to a table with a filthy tablecloth. Not appetizing. The food was okay, the waitress was cheerful and attentive, probably because she saw I was discombobulated by the atmosphere. I was trying to be a \"come with gal\" for my husband. The bathroom was nothing short of 3rd world. Gak. Two stars because the food was fine, but it scared me. I tremble to think what the kitchen looked like.",

I've read some reviews that say their falafel is good, which I can't speak to. I can say that the gyro, the side greek salad that came with it and the baklawa were overpriced and disgusting. The shredded iceberg that topped the gyro and comprised most of the salad was browing and reminded me of what subway would have thrown out .The baklawa was soggy. This might explain why they were completely empty and able to serve me quickly right around noon on a week day. I'd say the Schlotsky's two doors down would be a better and cheaper options. If I really want a gyro, I'll go the mall food court and get a cheaper gyro that actually tastes good from Pita Jungle.",

The staff likes to make an appearance once every 30 minutes or so, almost like waiting on the fountains at the Bellagio. If you need anything, be prepared to wait.  I always give places a second chance - sometimes people just have off days. I've since come back to Pita House 3-4 more times, and each time yields the same result.  Today will be my last time coming in, as their newest \"Policy\" is to no longer serve free tap water. Fairly certain the server was trying to upsell me a bottle of water - to his surprise I refused, which he realized he couldn't retract his statement. I'm now sitting here without a beverage and it's currently 114 degrees outside. Last I checked, restaurants that serve alcohol are required to provide free drinking water. I may be wrong, but either way, the server shouldn't have responded in such a rude way.  *Update: 45 minutes after the water encounter, the server brought me a chilled bottle of water \"On the House\" like he was doing me a favor.  I'll say it again: The food here is pretty good, but if you don't like waiting around and enjoy actual service, I highly recommend you stay away from this place.",

I have lived here all my life and I haven't been because I don't spend much time in the area. But it was late, in the area and I was hungry, so we're my friends.   First off, the service is super slow. Not only that, we had to ask serval times for stuff we wanted like a beer and ketchup. We spent over $70 for almost nothing. This place is way over priced for what it is.  I got the chicken shawarma pita. First off Haji Baba is 100,000 times better than this and cheaper and I would rather go to Halal Guys over this place. Not a lot of chicken and here were pickles inside this and not the middle eastern pickles some small sliced nonsense. The only thing I liked were the fries. Although I asked for extra crispy and they were just hot. :/ sigh. We also ordered the tzatziki sauce app and gyro app. It was standard and nothing to really write about.  The hookah was decent. They have one of the best flavored tobaccos used, but honestly they killed it with too many coals and it became harsh pretty quick. They also charge $6 a person extra of the 2 max to smoke hookah. I mean come on. $6 for another piece of plastic on top of what we are already paying for...I'm good.  Honestly I won't be back for anything. The food was subpar to be nice. Not impressed at all from anything. Should have yelped this before with the low stars they have. Cheers to another one.",

    "text": "9/25/18 Yelp Review Pita House 7210 E 1st Ave, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 (480) 425-9200  I was a lot of times in pita house, I really love the atmosphere. It reminds me of good memories from my homeland. The foods are totally great especially hummus, grape leaves, and tabbouleh. These are some of the Mediterranean amazing food I strongly recommend you taste it. They made from fresh, light, delicious vegetables, and real lam. When I say real lam, I mean the meat is much tastier, softer, and juicer than beef. If you want to try it you should come to Pita House. Even if you are familiar with Mediterranean foods you should try their version. For example, you may think of tabbouleh as a bulgur salad with lots of parsley and mint. But real Lebanese tabbouleh is a lemony herb salad with a little bit of fine bulgur, an edible garden that you can scoop up with romaine lettuce heart leaves or simply eat with a fork.  It's a friendly place that you can spend a good time with your friend, your family, and even by yourself. The waiters and waitress are very greeting but sometimes it seems they need more training. I remember one time I went with a large group of friend and the waitress who was a nice girl from Syria took our orders but she didn't even a notebook or something to take a wide ranges f different orders. She was trying to memorize all orders but for a group more than ten people like us it is kind of impossible. However, after a long time waiting for our orders it came with some errors. Some foods and order were not coming or mistake! So, many of our friend our frustrating and/or pissed. One of ours it was so mad who she doesn't want to pay! Although greeting is always important the good service and delivering correctly is even more important. Another positive about the place is music. They have a very good selection most of the time from American, European, Arabic, and especially Persian music that cause I feel home. They also have live music at weekends that usually are duet bands with a guitarist and singer that is really fun. I have to mention that sometimes the music very loud and the quality is a little bit distorting that could be bothering for a long time.  The most important thing the restaurant is known for is its hookah. Pita House is, first of all, a hookah bar. Its hookah menu has a wide range of great different taste of shisha flavors like orange, lavender mint, root beer, citrus ice, cucumber, peach, and etc. that you can order separately or mixed. The servers are really expert to balance the charcoals and tobacco amount which doesn't burn and annoying your throat. They change tobacco and charcoals as many times as you need without extra charge. They do such a good job on it.  Overall, Pita House is a lovely friendly place for dating or spending time with your friends and family. When my wife joins me in the US after three years we have to tolerate temporary separation; I really wanted to make a pleasant time in great restaurants and bars. Pita house was one of my priority options and I'm glad that my wife loves it too. Now we enjoy from this fantastic hookah bar together.",

Both of the times I have been here the staff has been consistently good service-wise.  I have tried several food items and it's fairly good as well.  I do have other spots that I would go to if I was purely interested in just eating.    Pita House is pretty neat because they offer food, adult beverages, a dance/lounge area, and hookah .... Plus the people that come here are way more chill than you would find @ Oasis.  Additionally, if you come here late night there most likely won't be a crazy long wait to get food/hookah.  I believe certain nights they may even still have belly dancers dancing around the venue, which was pretty cool to see since I've never seen that before.  The prices here are fairly reasonable for old town scottsdale, and as I mentioned above I like it here better than its closest competitor up the street Oasis.   There is nothing exceptional or amazing here, but it gets the job done if you want to eat, drink, and hookah.  I would absolutely recommend Pita House to others.",

The atmosphere and service was nice - everyone seemed to be having fun and chilling. Music they were pumping out, which was mostly middle eastern, was rather catchy and fun.  The actual set up was a bit poor - tables/chairs were plastic patio furniture and it actually backed onto their kebab house!  Which made it appear shabby.  However, on the whole I quite enjoyed the experience and having a drink and checking out something different.  I would def recommend for a quick drink and shesha.

    "text": "I found myself in downtown Scottsdale one evening after a long day at work. Extremely tired and way hungry, I started scanning for my options, and locked eyes on Pita House, because, well, I can never get enough of Middle Eastern food.   Pita House is arranged in an odd way - there are small plastic tables on the asphalt out in front, which means you'd be eating in the actual parking lot, and small tables on the side, where in the back is a hookah bar with no one tending it nor anyone sitting there. Very empty and I'm a little doubtful if it actually fills up later in the evening. But at least they had Arabic pop music playing, which, I guess, is something better than nothing.  I didn't want to eat too heavy and greet folks I was meeting up with later half-asleep, so I just ordered the chicken kebab sandwich. I then sat on the side patio and hung out. My sandwich came about 5 minutes later and I'll first begin with the minuses:  * The Salad: I hate all that Costco shredded iceberg lettuce crap that so many places use as their side salad. If I want cole slaw, I'd go to KFC. This salad was extremely unremarkable. Bah. * The Pita: It was cold and not all that special. Having the pita warmed up as well would have been a good touch.  And now the pluses:  * The Actual Chicken: Excellent. The seasonings were really tasty and the chicken was grilled just right - maintaining its juices and not drying out. I would have preferred to eat a plate just of full of these chicken pieces and nothing else. I think I'll get it as a plate special next time around.  * Service: Very friendly and efficient, even though it was only one girl who was doubling as both the cashier/kitchen manager and the server.   So three stars for now. More if I make it back for more meals and become impressed with the other stuff. But if you are in the neck of the woods and are looking for a decent, casual ethnic eating option that won't break the bank, try it out. I'd go back.",

I got the Kafta Kubideh Pita sandwich and it came with a salad. The pita sandwich was really good and I especially liked the grilled taste on the meat. The salad was ok, nothing special (shredded lettuce and dressing) All in all I liked the meal. The price was a little high in my opinion as my meal with a drink was 11 bucks and change.

I said well can I atleast get a drink? He said sure and got me a beer.  The interesting part was that they continued serving the other tablea with food atleast 30minutes after i asked him.

    "text": "I used to come here every now and then YEARS ago and it's...a lot different now? It's been a LONG time but I think part of the restaurant used to be indoors and the menu was a little more extensive. I think there used to be some entree type options and now it seems to be pretty much pita, salads, shawarma and such. I'm not sure if now that they're a hooka lounge as well now has something to do with the changes (again, I hadn't been here in FOREVER).  I totally get the terrible reviews for this place. I met a friend here for lunch and we were the only ones here on a late weekday afternoon. The one guy working upfront seemed completely uninterested in helping us. When we walked in he poked his head out of a storage room and said he'd be with us in a few minutes. I get having to multitask, but it seemed to me like when there's nobody else in the restaurant take the two quick orders and go back to the stuff in the backroom rather than make customers wait. If there were even a few more customers in this place I have a feeling the whole process of ordering/waiting for food would have been irritatingly long. Since this place is only a patio (how do they make it in the summer?) there's just a small counter area to take orders.   The reason I'm not giving this place a completely terrible review though is because the food is still good. I got a basic chicken shawarma that came with a side salad. The chicken was flavorful and I liked the dressing on the salad. It was a good size portion as well. I'm not sure I'd dine in here again, but I'd maybe get takeout (although that sounds problematic from other reviews).",

They hire people that don't speak English or Arabic (go figure) so it's tough to communicate.

My husband and I popped in here after a night out and needed a bite but ended up with the baba ganoush, some hookah, and a beer! I hadn't smoked hookah since high school and it brought back so many memories! We ordered a peach concoction of some sort. The service was super friendly and we left happy! :)   Yesterday, I was in the area and needing a bite and remembered how tasty the baba ganoush was so I popped in and ordered it for lunch, along with a simple Greek salad. The salad was tasty too! It had a ton of veggies and I loved the homemade dressing. It is definitely different in the daytime but the food is still good!  Anywho, we'll absolutely be back, if anything just for the baba! YUM!",

He additionally had two tables sitting outside that he had to wait in addition to the walk-ins.  -We ordered two chicken salads and two side dips, and it ended up being nearly $40. This is Pita House, not the Persian Room. The 'Greek Salad' was essentially a simple bed of lettuce with 1 Chicken Kabob. The Kabob of chicken was $5 plus an upcharge of $1 for making it kabob. You do not have an option to make it non-kabob. As you can see, the $14 salad is as big as its receipt.   -The prices listed on the menu \"vary\".  -Dirty  I love Middle Eastern food and don't know how this place is still in business.

All I know was that nothing was both edible and impressive.   The hummus was lemony and tahini-y, but seemed mediocre, mostly because the pitas that came with it were stale and cold. They were out of rice and gave us salad instead (as if that's somehow comparable.) Plus, none of it was cheap, and since I should be paying in shekels for this stuff, I was a bit confused as to what warranted its price. Maybe because it's in Old Town Scottsdale and dumb tourists will throw their money at everything made of faux-adobe? Regardless, the rest of us don't appreciate poor value.  On to the better aspects... it's open really, really late. That means you can get a round of hookah at 11 and chill until 1:30 in the morning while waiters constantly bring you new coals and shisha refills. The shisha is decent, too. They have all the flavors your dentist used to offer you in fluoride when you were 7, and then some. We had the cherry, which didn't even taste faintly of medicine, so I was content as far as that goes.  Overall, it's a nice late-night hangout spot. The hookah's good. The outside seating is warm. The food is nether good, nor warm, but that's not why you're there, remember? You're there to enjoy being in a nice setting at one in the morning, as am I.",

The hummus was good.  I'm seriously in love with the babaghanouj, it had the best slightly charred smoky flavor.  The salad itself was unimpressive, but that garlic dressing they put on it is crazy good, and guaranteed to keep vampires and bad dates at bay.    The hookahs smelled amazing; I'm definitely going to have to come back and try them sometime.    They also have a little take out window, which is conveniently separate from the rest of the place.

We were there with our kids and intentionally sat away from anyone smoking but, within a short time, others came outside and started smoking so we were surrounded.    We waited and waited for our food and watched while others who came in after us got their food.  At one point, the waitress apologised saying they had a huge party.  Not sure when the huge party got there but, they weren't there when we walked in.    Finally got our appetizer - chicken with garlic and mushrooms.  Canned mushrooms.  Gross.  The chicken and sauce were good but seriously?  Canned mushrooms?  How much effort does it take to chop a few fresh mushrooms?  I had the gyro salad - it had iceberg lettuce, a couple tomato slices and a few cucumbers.  The gyro meat was good but, really?  iceberg lettuce?  Sigh....  It did come with tzatziki sauce but, I've had better.  This tasted like it came out of a bottle - definitely not freshly made.

    "text": "I've been coming to this place for years. It's cheap and yummy. And, located in downtown Scottsdale, that's a rare find. For $5, the falafel sandwich is the best bargain. The falafel is crispy, and the sandwich is rolled up with hummus, tahini and tomato. It comes with a little iceberg lettuce salad that's unremarkable -- except for the tangy dressing (maybe sumac?) that makes it flavorful. The actual falafel here is probably the best in the Valley. It's the only thing I've tasted that comes close to the home-made falafel my friend used to make for us all at bar time....that stuff rocked.  A few tips, though: First, don't bother parking in the parking lot. It's tiny and I've seen cars almost hit each other (or diners) on multiple occasions. Just park on the street. Also, order ahead. The service can be kind of slow, so just go online and order about 10 minutes before you get there. If the weather is nice, it's a great place to eat outdoors.",

Tastes bland and a bit stale as if it was sitting around for awhile. The pita bread was not fresh at all, way too chewy.  The service was actually really good.. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, because the place looked authentic and the reviews seemed favorable.  I was very disappointed.  By the way, my standard for falafel is Mamoun's Falafel in Manhattan, NY with 1000+ reviews. That's how falafel is done...",

    "text": "So we wandered into Pita House on a Sunday afternoon. It's small and unassuming. It plays techno Middle Eastern music, shows Egyptian pride commercials on their one TV and the walls are painted to look like they're cracked stone and like you're in someone's pyramid basement.   AND IT IS DELICIOUS.  The falafel. THE FALAFEL. Perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously falafely on the inside. Three tasty falafel patties stuffed into a tasty warm pita with veggies and tahini sauce. As someone else noted, their very simple salad (uhh, lettuce and a tomato slice) is topped with a dressing made of the tears of fairies and hopes and dreams.  The tahini was added slightly on the heavy side for my liking, kind of drowning my whole falafel pita, but that's my own fault. I generally ask for it on the side and it just skipped my mind this time. No big deal. We were the only ones in there for a while but 5 or 6 other tables came in while we were finishing lunch. There was only one girl running both the dining room and the to-go shack (who looked about 15 years old) but she was taking care of everything pretty easily.  Pita House is a perfect cheap lunch decision and...I might need to get down there this afternoon.",

This place is really on a downward trend when it comes to their quality and service, which is disappointing to see because I've been coming here for as long as I can remember. I keep coming back to give this place another chance, but somehow every visit gets considerably worse. My party was seated on the patio and there was only one other gentleman sitting outside. We put in our order for just a hookah which came pretty quickly, but was not to my specifications. Then the two only two employees that seemed to be working that afternoon walked by us several times without so much as asking if we needed anything. Again, there was only one other gentleman there, so I don't believe there is a valid reason for the lack of service. Eventually, a server walked by and I asked her to get someone to bring us new coals. We did get new coals... About 35 minutes later, at which point we had to leave. After this experience, I have decided to finally give up on this place.",

Outside is fine, but not in the summer   Only like three tables inside   A couple walked in looked around and split.  So I give them 4 stars for last time, would have gone 3 today. But if you don't eat meat there are great options.  Get the falafel with hummus and you might be happy. But I can't guarantee anything.  Very polite staff",

We walked into the bar/ lounge area looking for someone for direction but quickly noticed this was a bar scene and not a scene for a 16 year old. Finally we found the patio area and we sat down at a table. There was a couple sitting a few tables away from us but no one on the staff acknowledged our presence. As I was looking for someone to help clean our table, I noticed there were a couple of teenage kids in the back corner of what looked like a kitchen, sitting down and looking at us. They never summoned anyone to help us nor did they offer to lend a hand to service us. Our table had a lot of dried bird droppings so we almost left but decided to tough it out. We ordered dinner but were never asked if we wanted anything to drink. Weird? I had to flag down a waiter who was passing by for some drinks. Just about that time 5 men decided to sit down at the table next to us and each one ordered a hookah. That made the experience even more distasteful because of the myriad of hookah scent smells mixing in with our dinner. We decided to hurry and eat and get the hell out of there. Then To make matters worse the waiter was clearing out each of the hookah chambers by blowing which spread the residual ashes into the air and of course onto our table. Let's just say the whole place seems to cater to smoking and NOT to a fine dining experience. We will not be back but thought I'd share the experience especially if someone wanted to eat in the patio area outside.",

Not sure if the staff is mainly family, but there's no consideration or customer service -- lack of friendliness. No one comes to clean your hookah, so it tastes like ash after while. The bathrooms are disgusting. Menus aren't clean and feel sticky. Seats had rips and tears. And there was men asleep in the booths, either drunk or making themselves too at home. Its actually creepy.

Service is really slow so expect to wait a good 20 min for your food, but the wait is worth it. I had the combo plate that has beef and chicken kabob And kafta with rice and it was delicious. It is also open until 2 am including the kitchen so it's perfect for a late dinner when other places are already closed. Overall great experience.",

A friend and I had the day off and wanted day hookah where we can relax and enjoy the day without doing it our selves so we came back to Pita house being it's basically the only hookah spot opened during the day and let me tell you it's my last time I will be there. We wanted to watch a game on TV and there TVs weren't working they have like more than 4 and I guess they didn't have cable or something. We decided to sit outside after sitting down and being the only people inside I saw flys everywhere it was so gross and like those small food flies that are just flying around me I was grossed out so I said let's go outside. So we sat outside and got charcoal once and I went and grabbed my own because I couldn't see any workers. This place just needs a new makeover from the inside and out and staff. This place really sucks. Never going back to be honest.",

Was greeted with attitude. \"Yea... and what do you want?\" -Cashier/Server girl. I asked for a gyro with no onions, no tzatziki sauce, and add feta. Pretty basic order. The girl verified I wanted no tzatziki sauce. She then followed  her question with \"You just need to raise your standards then.\" As of this point, I'm hungry and I just want my food. I sat down and waited for my meal. 30 mins pass, no food. I couple that was their before I asked if they could at least get their hummus. That same girl replied, \"Oh yea, it was sitting here. Here you go.\" Now the moment I have been waiting for. My food arrived. It had extra tzatziki sauce, no onion and no feta. I politely told the girl that I asked for no tzatziki sauce and add feta. And I asked her to send it back. I then asked her to make it to go because I only get an hour lunch break. As of this point it has been 45 mins since I have ordered. When I received my order, again. I noticed all they did was take the meat that had tzatziki sauce on them off the sandwich and threw on feta. I am not impressed nor pleased with this situation. I recommend to go anywhere else but here.",

It was a bit too much for me, so on subsequent visits, I ordered the Gyro Classic Sandwich.  The Gyros are ok, not great.  My favorite menu item here is the Vegetarian Combo.  It has all of my favorites on it.....Falafel, Hummus, Tabbouleh, yum!  However, I've had better in my life, which is why I'm only giving this joint 3 stars.  The service is so/so here.  One evening, we had awesome service....on a couple other visits, it wasn't very good.  I thank Groupon for introducing me to a new restaurant, but it isn't on my all time list.  Return Factor - 50%",

I would have taken it back but was in a group of people who ordered from the sandwich shop next door. They forgot the hummus in the sandwich and the tabbouli salad had none- I repeat NO bulgur in it. Stale pita and easily one of the top 3 WORST places I have ever eaten at, in both service and quality of food. This is a place that deserves to not stay in business.",

I've experienced quite a line of lackluster lunchroom locations as of late, and I'd like to learn what little leprechaun is leaning their bad luck my way.  With that out of my system. I've got to say this place has got the market cornered on mediocre. A quick visit to their official website shows a claim of \"Voted #1 Mediterranean/Middle Eastern ...\" I assure you, they did NOT get my vote.  As far as the service was concerned; we were one of two tables seated about 6 - 7pm on a Wednesday, the waitress visited us 1) to take our order, 2) deliver our drinks, 3) drop off / pickup our check. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food. Our waitress didn't seem rude during the few times she did swing by, but also wasn't excited for us to be there.  We started with an order of hummus, which turned out to be neither here nor there, then ordered a Gyro Plate and Kafta (Kubideh). The gyro meat seemed pre-packaged and the kafta (grilled ground beef) seemed underspiced and bland. We did; however, order a tasty chicken skewer side, which was good.   Nothing about this meal was really fantastic and I definitely not worth coming back. I'm guessing they do most of their business during late night after people have had too much to drink to realize they're eating a sub par meal.  Be sure to let me know where your favorite Gyro is, 'cause I'm still looking!",

We weren't told how long it would be or how much our order was going to cost.  I ordered the gyro pita with the house salad.   We head over, pay and get out order (the gal seemed irritated to have to walk over to the other side to run the card), and head back to work.  I dive into my lunch and something is off.  The salad was warm, like wilted warm.  Who wants to eat warm floppy lettuce?  Anyone...Anyone...Bueller?      My gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  I ended up throwing most of my lunch away -  there was no salvaging any of it.  Not sure if there's new owners or management...but the quality and customer service has definitely gone downhill.

However on this evening, a friend and I went into the hookah/ bar section for a drink toward the end of the night.  We each had a drink and while standing at the back bar noticed a guy hovering.  Not too concerned.  The place was close to closing and we went outside to call an Uber.  While we are standing in the PUBIC parking lot, the bouncer from the place storms out and yells at us to \"stop touching the owners car\".  It was the guy who was hovering near us at the bar.  He is immediately very aggressive and at no point tried to calmly engage us.  We tried explaining we were not touching the car, just waiting for our Uber and would be gone momentarily.  He was not having it and started screaming at us about calling the cops and that we couldn't stand there.  I agreed that he should call the police if he felt it necessary and as he was grabbing his phone a pen fell out of his pocket.  I picked it up for him and handed it to him and his response was \"Don't f*ing touch my stuff\".  How professional.  Thankfully, the police did arrive and were amazing.  One officer stood with us (in the same public spot) while our car arrived while the other brought the terrible bouncer back into the establishment and hopefully away from any other potential customers/victims of his misdirected rage.  The officer literally asked us \"Why were we even called??\".  Good question.  Hats off to our Scottsdale police for handling the situation well and making sure everyone got home safe.  Will certainly not visit this place again, at least as long as this guy is employed there.",
