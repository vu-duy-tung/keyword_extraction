    "text": "Every single visit I've had to Windsor has been positive. Whether I'm sitting out on the patio under low lights next to a heater, or inside a cozy booth by their spacious bar inside, it is always a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy with friends or on a date.  Enough about the atmosphere, though - the food. I haven't met a dish here that I don't like. They have great salads (my favorite is the ahi tuna salad) that leave you satisfied. The sandwiches are the star here, though. I have enjoyed everything from the Backyard Burger to the Bahn Mi, and they are all spectacular. Great medium cook on the burger, tangy sauces (even a good kick on the bahn mi), amazing pork belly in the porkwitch... it's just so good. My favorite so far though has been the Oyster Po Boy. Giant pieces of lightly fried oysters and a huge helping of slaw to top it in the perfect roll.   The sides continue to rock my socks. Most people will rave about their mac and cheese, and it certainly deserves its accolades, but my favorite is the fried okra. The cornmeal breading stays on it perfectly and the dipping sauce they serve with it is perfection.   \"But Libby!\" You exclaim. \"Whatever shall I drink with these delicious dishes?\" Oh, let me tell you, friend. Do not miss the liquor at Windsor. The Number 63, with burbon, fresh grapefruit and honey syrup is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. Not too sweet, not too bitter, not too liquory, just right. My other favorite is the Number 9 with rye, pineapple and mint. They're all worth a go (I just lean towards darker liquors) - definitely give it a shot. (see what I did there?)  Overall, this is one of my favorite places in the valley. Upward Projects knew what they were doing when they created this amazing place for everyone (next to an ice cream store, no less) - it's a must in my book!",

I sat in the corner near the Bloody Mary bar and everything looked clean and stocked.  The bartender, a tall lad just busting out service well drinks took care of me intermittently.  He was great.   I went with the green Bloody Mary. It was a great concept but it needed something. I added salt and a little extra from the free service bar and it made it perfect. They had a breakfast sandwich on a large English muffin type bread and I seriously think it's my favorite restaurant breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  I wanted more!!! Even though it was plenty food I finished my cheesy potatoes with the biggest grin. Keep up the good work.",

Okay but left me craving a much more flavorful and spicy Thai dish which it loosely resembled. Had a couple of my daughters chicken wings and they were disappointing. Seemed to be slightly glazed in spicy sauce but not very flavorful throughput and appeared a tad undercooked. And believe me I know wings. Took a bite of my other child's Windsor burger and it was probably the tastiest thing we ate. Overall a 3/5. Won't be returning as there's a great option right around the corner, St. Francis...",

This is a nice place, on a great day. We chose to eat inside as the sun was to be going down soon, and it was a bit cold for me. My daughter tired several cocktails , she said all were very tasty. Especially one with cucumber. Which I as well tasted and enjoyed. The food took a long time but, the staff is very attentive and check on you a lot. It is like a group event. Everyone checks on you, and they are all very pleasant. The nice thing is before 5o'clock all drinks were only $5.00 no wonder it was so busy there. I got the Lobster roll, it was good but, it has a lot of seasoning on it. Really not necessary, just let me taste the Lobster.  We also got cierviche for an appetizer. Very good, I would order that again. My two dining companions all liked their food as well. A Ruben , and a club type thing. You can change out the bread if you like, and they have Gluten free. I got sweet potato fries, good. The shoe string fries ,not so good. But, it is a great place and worth a visit.  Love the decor and the old look about it. Clean restrooms and the parking can be very tight.",

Kale salad great layers of flavor and texture. Crab cake BLT sandwich had awesome flavor. Seared ahi salad good. Sweet potato fries really tasty.  We enjoyed this restaurant and will def come back.  A smidge on the pricey side, but great little place. Hipster urban setting.",

But the gold medal flapjacks are one f my favorite breakfast items ever!! I'm a syrup girl and I never eat syrup with these. They are amazing plain but add the marscapone and strawberries and its perfection!! My husband loves the rest of the menu as well. They have an amazing Pimms Cup drink and my hubby loves the Bloody Mary bar. Watch out for the green Bloody Mary it's spicy!   They are very kid friendly which we really appreciate.

It's a decent crowd. Our server / bartender Manny was really friendly, but not annoying, which gripes me with some servers. Made suggestions and made amazing drinks. Checked in with us frequently ensuring we had everything we needed. Coming in today feeling I would already be unimpressed. The service Manny provided changed my mind. I may be a new fan. Tip: hit up the bar and ask for Manny.",

They serve delicious food, whether you're craving comfort food or you're a health nut, there is something on the menu for you. I think they're house burger with garlic aioli is awesome and I like that most items come with a side dish.. and we're talking not your typical sides like fries. Think mac and cheese, fried okra, fried pickles, lentil soup etc. Even their side salads are memorable! On a recent visit we had the the ceviche, lobster roll (available weekends only) and ordered a side of Mac and cheese. The seafood was surprisingly fresh ( you never know, we do live in a desert!) and the proportions were good. The Lobster roll was more of a seafood roll as it had crab ad shrimp in it. It was cold creamy and tasty but sadly the lobster itself was a little dry. Probably won't order it again. They charged us for the Mac and never brought it out but once we told them about it, not only did they take it off the bill but they packed some extra mac and cheese to go for us. Amazing service! You walk in to the restaurant and expect them to be a little pretentious lol but the servers are generally pretty friendly even if they always aren't the most attentive. Also, they are located right next to Churn... super tempting which is probably they don't have much of a dessert menu haha. Overall a great place with great food for locals or to impress out of town guests. I've done both!   Oh also, we are loving the new parking lot, no more residential street parking!",

But, among other difficulties, their soup tasted like what I made as a college freshman my first time making something from hot water vegetables and a chicken leg - and then added a grotesque volume of pepper because it didn't taste like anything - that is what I overpaid for here. Fried okra tasted like something I used to get from a grocery store frozen foods bin and microwave until it was crispy, the ranch dressing tasted like some bottled slop I used to get in the '80s, the burger bun was white gluten glop and the burger boring.  We got a card with our check asking for our contact info so we can get bombarded with 'social media'.Instead of giving up all our contact info, we simply wrote \"see our yelp reveiw\".

The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and it's right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postino's. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip.  There was a 30-minute wait for my party of two on a recent Friday night, and we sat in the indoor dining area, which overlooked the bar, which was bustling full of people and had standing room only. The restaurant is located in an historic brick building, and it has a cool wall covered completely in cassette tapes that makes it feel even hipper.  For food, my pal and I started with the Cheddar Fondue ($11) off the mostly-American menu, which comes with pretzels, apples, pork, bread and sausage. The pretzels were soft and chewy, and the portion was huge. I would have preferred just the pretzels, though the apples and cheese were an interesting combination. Definitely try that appetizer if you go-it was super-tasty.  For my meal, I got the Veggie Stack ($9), which was a pita topped with bean spread, quinoa, tomato, cucumber, avocado, radish,  corn and green goddess (I left the pickled beets off). I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I weren't wowed. Maybe it's because the cheese wasn't plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good. My pal had the Porkwich sandwich ($12). He said he liked it a lot.",

    "text": "Are we all talking about the same Windsor's here? Next to Churn? Where the staff is indifferent with their attitude. Hint....listen to some Zig Zigler tapes it might help your service abilities. These lady servers with their ripped jeans and tattoos and no smiles just ruin it for me. This isn't the first time either. This place just seems like where you start to earn your bones and the right to work across the street at Joyride or Federal pizza where servers look presentable and are friendly.  The food is ok but overpriced. I get stressed anytime I am there because I know someone will drop the ball in regards to service or food will have an issue. However, when the check arrives then it's all \"hey have a fantastic day\" so that she will get a good tip. Right the great thing about Windsor is it's a great place for me to get rid of my spare change for the service they provide. Remember folks the tattoos don't make you stand out or be original, they make you like every other person who looks homeless on Van Buren st.   Get a grip and when you fix it maybe I will reconsider. Ohh and don't dress like your unemployed, have some class servers.  Finally, teach your cook how to make eggs the right way. I would be glad to teach his staff.",

    "text": "I've been here multiple times, and overall really love it. The food here has almost always been really excellent, and I'll admit, I'm shallow. So I fall for the hip decor and the fact that the waiters are cool and cute and the waitresses have tats and a wardrobe to die for. It's great both inside and outside, and their outdoor patio IS dog friendly!  Their Windsor style Backyard Burger is really great. It's enormous, and juicy and about ready to fall apart when you bite into it. I've also had their brunch items. My Easy Rider fritatta took some warming up to, but in the end I fell for the combination of summer tomatoes and tart goat cheese. My husband had the Matador, and it is incredible. I don't normally go for that combination of flavors, but just wonderful. Hands down so much better than what I got, though that too was good. Also, if it doesn't come with your brunch, splurge on the bacon side. INCREDIBLE. There's something that Tenderbelly does to their bacon, but it was smokey and sweet and just whoa.   We've had their cheddar fondue and their devilled egg dip for appetizers, and both are great. The fondue was smooth and silky, and the egg dip had tons of bacon and gorgonzola. The chips are fried in house, so if you like thick, crispy, kettle style chips they're going to be a home run. As for sides, their roasted vegetables are great. Crisp still, but charred. A touch greasy though.   For drinks I've had their No. 17, which is good, but my hands down favorite is a brunch only thing. Their $5 Pitcha of Pimms. $5. That's right, a PITCHA. Omg. My husband and I both liked their tradtional blood mary, but I loved loved loved how tart, and refreshing the Pimms was. And that it was in a pitcher.   They also have a neat service style, where their wait staff 1) wear their own clothes and 2) they don't split their floor into areas for a particular server. This is very good, because it means that anybody who walks by your table is available to help you. They're all actually very good about making sure you're taken care of. It does get confusing making out who is who, but the few times I've been there I more or less see the same faces, so it's easy to see who's who after awhile.   The only downsides are that its small and popular, plus it has a teensy weensy parking lot. They're a lot like La Grande, they have free valet, but still. You should tip them, so it's not 'free'. It gets crowded as well, and quite noisy inside. Plus their menu is a wee bit limited. I'd like to see things get changed up a bit, as I'm running out of new things to eat going there. Doesn't change the fact that it's all great though!",

Porkwich - do you need a description? PORKWICH. Bacon, ham, pulled pork, gold bbq sauce! Bring your cardiologist.

Not in a sports bar kind of way, but more like a place two friends that are guys regularly go to have a beer that don't want to drink bud light at a dive.   Over time, the $5 pitchers of beer before 5pm have won me over.   In addition to the great happy hour, they make some pretty spectacular drinks. The Number 17 is so refreshing. Manny is a fabulous bartender. They also have a few vegan food options - a sandwich and a mixed grain salad in addition to some sides. All have been fresh and tasty.   I love that during nice weather they can open the place up, and the patio is great. The bathrooms are pretty cool as well.   The parking is the real drawback. You either have to valet, which fortunately is complimentary, or try to find a spot on the residential streets that won't end up getting you towed..  Overall I give Windsor a 3.5-4.0 stars.",

With its sophisticated comfort food (gourmet mac & cheese, delectable chicken salad, and of course the infamous porkwich), amazing atmosphere, thoughtful decor, okay and the booze too, Windsor is where the Earth ends and the great infinite beyond begins.  It is where mere mortals can fuel up with the bread and wine of the Gods and experience greatness, if only for happy hour.  This place doesn't take itself too seriously.  The waitstaff have been carefully tested and selected to be the chillest, most zen people on this side of the great infinite beyond.  Nothing is a big deal.  You're gonna eat, you're gonna drink, you're gonna be merry.  No one is too cool or not cool enough, yet the place is ripped from the pages of the Awesomeness Times.    One of my most favorite details about Windsor? Tucked away with the packets of sugar and Splenda you'll find cute little papers printed with an invitation to dispose of your gum in it.  There's really nothing they haven't thought of, to include having purse stands at the ready so you don't have to sit in front of your bag or drape it over the chair arm.  Details.    The answer to any question is always Windsor.  Try it.",

I would speculate that the muffins are homemade or bought local perhaps?  The environment of the place was cool and thy had great music playing.  The patio was nice and comfy (minus the plethora of flies but I attribute that to the very recent rain we had this morning).   I would say my only \"complaint\" is the service. It wasn't bad but our server just sort of acted like she didn't care, in general (maybe she was having an off day or maybe donor was rude to her earlier...never know). However, she wouldn't look me in the eyes (or even at my face) when she'd ask a question or I'd request something or answer her questions. She'd do drive-by questions where they ask you something as they walk by and don't really stop or even slow down to listen to your answer. I also didn't get a full cup of coffee and didn't get asked if I wanted a refill.  My attempts to stop her to ask for more failed as well since she didn't look in our direction as she was near us. All minor things of course but just something that would have helped get a 5 out of 5 rating from me.   I'd definitely go again and would recommend going for a laid back upscale unpretentious breakfast. Just be prepared to wait for that second cup of coffee.",

Very high quality and tastes very good. The macaroni and white cheese is also very good. I've been ordering sandwiches from here, everyday for lunch, for the past week or so. Very good place. Stopped in once to pick up my order and ended up at the bar with a big ass pitcher of beer for $5 during happy hour. This place is ok with me. Thanks",

The reason being, the atmosphere.  I absolutely love the dog friendly patio, what a great place to enjoy the AZ weather, along side a tasty beverage and some delicious food.    HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY till 5pm that's really nice!  WEEKEND BRUNCH, that's also really nice.  Like $5 PITCHERS of Pimm's Cup nice!! That's right I said a pitcher haha!  All the food I've tried has been great.  The cocktails are amazing also.  The bottom line, I love this place because of the atmosphere.  I usually come during Brunch or Happy Hour, I suggest doing the same with good company.",

Hubby had the Picnic Kabobs (\"Healthy option\"); sonny had the Windsor Burger (\"Well-seasoned\"); and I had the Pastrami Reuben with fired okra on the side (very tasty). Churn (an ice cream/candy shop) is right next door, so we headed over there for dessert afterward. I ate too much. Again.  Four-star rating because it's too dark and the music is too loud. I'm all for atmosphere and all that, but if you can't hear or see...  Also, parking is a little tight (but then, we were in a big truck).  Overall, good experience. Service was good; everyone was friendly (even on the phone).",

Friendliest bartenders, all the girls asked how my night was going. I always like to ask for them to make a custom drink and they always deliver. I came in around 7:30ish tonight and it was pretty busy,- so if you are planning on coming in by yourself for a drink, or perhaps have a more intimate atmosphere with someone, I would recommend around 8pm once the dinner crowd starts to leave. I have yet to have an actual entree here, but I've enjoyed every drink I've had here, which is most, and any of the appetizers will hit the spot. I definitely see myself becoming a regular here and fully recommend either trying a cocktail from the menu or trusting one of the amazing bartenders at The Windsor.",

    "text": "I came here before the Cardinals football game. My friend suggested it and I'm always game to try another place. I'm walking in the front of the restaurant and I'm totally confused. There's two doors in the front but it's by tables. No hostess stand so I don't go in and follow this couple behind me. They lead me to the back and there's the door. Even an outdoor patio. Very cool.   So I get an indoor table and the vibe in this place is very cool. Very hip. Seems very relaxed. People just enjoying their meals and talking. Not in a rush.   Anyways, I started off with a cappuccino with almond milk. First time with almond milk for me but it was actually really good. It doesn't look at pretty with the other milk but it really hit the spot.   So the menu is really interesting. I wanted to try everything. Seemed very different. So I decided to order breakfast cause all the other tables had breakfast. Must be good. So I ordered the Highroad sandwich with a side of cheddar potatoes. The sandwich had scrambled eggs, thick slices of bacon, tomatoes on some really fresh bread. I wasn't expecting a lot but wow did it work. Really tasty with that fresh chewy bread. It really worked for me. Loved it. Nice big portions. The cheddar potatoes were also outstanding. Really good.   My friend ordered the backyard Windsor burger and he said that it was really good. Enjoyed it.   Service was really good. I can't say they are slow but it seems like they don't rush anyone. Lots of people like to just sit, eat, and talk. Just a very casual and hip environment. Loved it. Not trying to rush you in and out but just cool. They also filled our water glasses frequently and brought refilled soda for my friend without even asking him. They really watch you and take good care of you.   I loved the ambiance, food and service. Really enjoyed it and can't wait to come back to try more menu items. Just don't come when your in a rush. You'll be disappointed. I for sure will be back. Enjoy",

Little did we know what we were getting into with our final stop at the Windsor. The staff went above and beyond to give some of the friendliest, but still unobtrusive service I have ever seen. Anthony made sure all our food and drinks were tasting great and gave us space to relax but somehow was always there exactly when we needed something. The drinks are delicious and the staff is extremely knowledgeable in the flavor profiles of everything so you can be confident they'll steer you in the right direction no matter what you're looking for. We will be back, with the utmost confidence that no matter who is on staff, both the service and staff will be only of the highest quality.",

    "text": "This is a delayed review from mid-December 2013.   I came here with 3 colleagues and a companion. My companion needed to wrap up his own work so he was late in meeting up with us. Colleagues and I ordered appetizers, drinks, and entrees while waiting for him. We had ceviche, deviled egg dip and chips, and corn dog poppers.   I don't know if you heard the one woman demolition derby was in town, but I obliterated the deviled egg dip. I don't even like bacon or gorgonzola. The savoriness and tanginess of all mixed together hit the spot and all spots, for that matter.   A large party having a holiday exchange arrived after us and were seated in an area behind us. Let's say this was a 15 person party. As I was seated facing the kitchen I watched tray after tray after tray being delivered to them although they arrived after us. Chalking it up to our incomplete party or perhaps a prix fixe menu, I was hardly concerned.   Finally, our entrees arrived probably a good hour or so after initial orders. My special man friend arrived about 5 minutes after our entrees did. He placed his order and received his meal in under 15 minutes.   We were having a grand old time but imagine our surprise when the waiter informed us our ENTIRE party of 5 had our ENTIRE bill COMPED due to the delay. For the record, we did not complain or show any consternation.   Great proactivity in anticipating customer needs and flawless service! Amy's Baking Company, you taking notes?   If I lived in Phoenix I would make this a weekly spot. Oh. Good music too. Notorious BIG and MGMT. I love it when you call me Big Poppa . . . and give me that electric feel.",

Showed up on a Friday at 7pm and for a table for 3 right away. Service was fast and our server was very knowledgable about their beers and that helped me try some new ones I have never had before.   We split the fondue that came with apple slices, soft pretzels slices and sausage slices. It was good however the sausage was more like salami. It was still meat but I was expecting nicely sliced grilled sausage links.   I got the porkwich for the main dish and it was amazing. Three different cuts of pork with an amazing sauce and cole slaw to go with it. I appreciated the fact that the server brought out my next beer with my main dish. The timing was a nice touch.   The other 2 in our party enjoyed their meals except for the fact that they asked for their burgers to be served on a bed of greens since they didn't do lettuce wraps and they were served as normal on buns. They are both gluten free by choice so they didn't fight it.   Good food. Good ambiance. Good ice cream next door at Churn for dessert.",

Not the best burger in town and not the worst. The winter grains salad on the other hand was absolutely fantastic! It was full of delicious goodies and had the perfect amount of dressing. The rest of the menu looked enticing as well. Overall it was a good experience.",

But the reason I'm finally writing my review is to give them a big thanks for our service last night: we took our kids there for dinner after our daughter's piano recital, and she was very excited to tell the wait staff about her performance. They were suitably impressed and enthusiastic, which would have been enough, but then they brought our two kids complementary ice cream sundaes for a job well done at the recital, and the kids just lit up. It really made our night, so thank you, Windsor, for going above and beyond.",

    "text": "What a fantabulous experience enhanced my the service, especially Mattie (one of the bartenders).  I arrived and sat at the bar since I was solo. I am always hesitant especially when I'm not drinking, but Mattie was so personable that anxiety went away.  I told him it was my first time and that I had seen a few items on the menu.   I told him what I was thinking and then he told me some of his favorites. So we settled on a hybrid of opinions. I had the Kale Caesar, the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a side of the Jo Church's Potatoes. The croutons on the salad were heavenly and the grilled sandwich was fantastic. I am not quite sure how they pulled all of the pieces together (mangoes, jalapeno mayo, tomatoes, onions) but they did. One thing to note was that on a hoagie.. this sandwich was MESSY, but I licked my fingers. As for the potatoes.. I wouldn't order them again.. They are like really decadent cheesy hashbrowns. Too rich for my liking and I *heart* cheese.  A nice touch was that the manager maybe gave me a coupon for a free scoop of ice cream at their sister restaurant. I was like wow! That's pretty cool.  Now let's discuss parking. can you say the PITS. I parked in the neighborhood behind the restaurant, but be sure to read the signs.. No one has time for tickets or tows.  I will totally recommend it to others.",

Where else in Phoenix can you find Okra?    I prefer dining on the outside patio to being inside, that's just me.  There've been a number of friends that have visited from Pittsburgh or Denver, this is the spot that I bring each of them.  The Windsor is known for it's local vibe that embraces you the moment that you enter.  Don't let the pub and tavern feel throw you, there is great food here and some fine hand-crafted cocktails as well.  There's also complimentary valet by Desert Parking, hand the guy / girl $2 or $3 dollars, it's worth it.    Windsor Square has strict parking enforcement due to the increased traffic from Upwards Projects restaurants ( Joyride Tacos Central, Federal Pizza, Postino Central, Churn and Windsor.)  I might even go as far as to say that they are re-creating the North-Central business community, in a good way.",

    "text": "Judging from one lunch experience, I have to give this place 5 stars. First off, it definitely had a \"Postino\" vibe...from the outside patio dining to the uni-sex bathrooms with stocked, stamped toilet paper.  The hosts were friendly when I entered the restaurant. That was a good start. Nothing worse than a snotty host who ignores you until you ask for service.  Our server was really sweet and attentive. He won me over right from the start when he complimented my sleeping baby. He was a tall, thin guy with some tattoos, most notably one on his neck that looked like bones. He was very patient and had a sense of humor...something you need to have when waiting on a 10-top of ladies at lunch.  The menu looked incredibly appetizing. A variety of bar snacks, apps, salads and sandwiches and unique sides like fried okra and chilled bean salad. I was going to have the country veggie chopped salad, but then I spied the Porkwich Sandwich and had to have it. This is what was on it: Pulled pork, Tenderbelly braised ham & smoked bacon layered with gold sauce & crunchy coleslaw on a buttermilk bun. How delish is that?! You can add any choice of side, and after inquiring about Jo's Church Potatoes, I had to have those to accompany my indulgent sandwich. They are basically like \"cheesy potato casserole.\" Creamy and rich and filling.   While the other gals who ordered the porkwich used a fork and knife to eat their sandwich, I said \"What the hell\" and picked it up with my hands and sloppily ate it. Yes, it was messy, but the flavors all came together in each bite and I was in pig out heaven. After half the sandwich was gone, I decided to be a bit more lady-like and ate it with a fork. Not as tasty that way...you can't get all the flavors together in one bite.  We were celebrating my birthday, so I got a cute little ice cream sandwich as dessert. It was two soft red velvet cookies sandwiched between some great french vanilla ice cream. I'm assuming this was a dessert you could get next door at Churn too.   I'm looking forward to going back again soon and trying more on the menu and hoping my opinion of the place stays at 5 stars.",

I didn't say anything, as I thought, \"well, maybe that's what New Orleans style is\", but I was wrong. I could maybe forgive the temp but these suckers did not cook long enough.

I made a reservation for 18 people for a triple birthday party and confirmed several times beforehand. When we arrived, we were split into two tables close to each other but not really close enough to have interaction. Disappointed by the set-up, I spoke with the manager inside. In addition to genuinely apologizing for the situation, he promised to \"see what he could do\" and get back to me. Sure enough, within minutes, he and his team cleared off a neighboring table and pushed it together with one of ours so we could all sit together and enjoy our delicious food and drinks. They were also very accommodating when we needed to do separate checks at the end of the meal. Ordinarily, I'm all about the food, but when service is this great, I have to say something.

It was good, but nothing mind-blowing. The cocktails were in my opinion, what fell a little flat. For $10/drink, I had slightly higher expectations. I probably should had stuck to wine. We had a few hiccups along the lines of service.

    "text": "This place was really fun to go eat at plain and simple. It was a lot trendier (in a good way) than I expected prior to going, and not as formal or snobby as I feared it may have been. The interior has the charming brick wall thing going for it and makes for a neat, functionally dimmed dining atmosphere. The music keeps it from being too heavy or intimate though which is ok with me. I thought it was all really great on those all those fronts. The menu was simple, original, and while not cheap, not terribly hard on the wallet either. Think Chili's/Applebee's prices, but for at least 5x's the quality of food. I love that the food is both delicious, pretty healthy, not boring, and grounded in the classics, but with their touch on it, if that makes sense like chicken sandwich, Louisiana ribs, Reuben sandwich, etc., rather than tofu this or vegan that, etc. They seem to have a good working knowledge of how vegetables, dressings/vinaigrettes/sauces, and meat enhance the overall dish without going overboard on any of those things. Case in point: the chopped kale salad with sliced almonds and a fruity vinaigrette to make it healthy as can be with no sacrifice to tasting yummy. I was even surprised to see they had a bar w/ a tv that had the game (game 6 of the nba finals in this case) on in the middle, but it didn't dominate the entire scene somehow and it was really easy to not even notice it if you were seated at a table. The wait staff was awesome too, they did a really good job being patient with my sister who definitely tested them on that night asking lots of questions about the menu and them having to give us more time to decide 3 times. It was pretty humorous and they handled it fantastically. I loved it all and can't wait to go back. Checked out the ice cream parlor connected to it after dinner and it looked great, but we decided to forego it this time, though being just \"this close\" to going for it. Next time.",

We clearly had a very healthy dinner :)    Atmosphere was unique and fun.  Service was great and the valet was complimentary which is always a nice touch.  We will definitely be back!",

Glasses of wine were okay (which is too bad since all the glasses are $9+) but the \"pitchas\" of beer are a pretty good deal. The food was alright, but the service left A LOT to be desired. Servers were slow and inattentive, and we had to consistently beg for water refills, which is a problem when you're sitting outside in 100+ degree weather. I recommend skipping dinner at this place and just heading next door for ice cream instead!",

    "text": "Gosh I was hoping for more here. The vibe and happy hour make it a worthwhile stop but the food and drink was disappointing and actually left our stomachs unsettled.  Their house margarita was so bitter and acidic that after one sip I stopped drinking it. A good stir did not help. It also had an off-putting 'refrigerator flavor'. Not a good start. I had the veggie stack which was not a stack at all but more of a pita spread with hummus, and a scattering of very fresh veggies and some  black quinoa,  and (the best part ) green goddess dressing. The pita was like thick piece of cardboard and my first bite had a nascent fishy taste and I swore mustard I tasted mustard which I would have asked them to hold, not a fan of that stuff. I decided to see if it improved but that pita was too much work even with the sharp serrated steak knife provided. The side dish of fried okra, my grandmother used to make this, wasn't worth the calories. It was reminiscent of something you would buy in the frozen section of your grocery store; tough, cold and a bit bitter as well.  The dip was good though. My husband ordered the crab BLT, which the server promised, \"the crab cakes were flown in fresh every day.\"  Should have caught 'crab cakes' because they tasted old and again like something you would get from your grocer's freezer. The side of coleslaw was very good though and a fresh take on the standard gloppy mix.   I'll try again because of the vibe and try to be more selective about what I order. And  I'll stick to wine.....",

I'll definitely be a repeat customer.    P.S. Love the hot tea selection that I've started to order two tea leafs and a bud from their website. Good job, Windsor.  P.P.S. We dined al fresco in the patio area on a such a cool, Feb evening.  Fire pit was warm and inviting.  Such great ambiance.  Good job again, Windsor.  P.P.P.S. I swiped the kids menu. Stuff on there looked good, too.",

My wife and I thank them for introducing us to day drinking a few years ago.  $5 pitchers of craft beer and deep discounts on their wine get us everytime.  Odell IPA is my pitcher of choice and the missus gets whatever red wine that tickles her fancy.  Then the food...awesome.  The burger I had was perfectly prepared, delicious and huge but the \"X\" factor is the housemade steak sauce...order an extra side to dunk your fries in.  It's that good.  Those pepper things that are kind of like the lottery (there is one super hot one mixed that you can't visually identify but your mouth will let you know) are great and addicting.  Kale salad - top notch.  The building is another great renovation by the owners.  I'm no architect but it has a mid-century look that has been updated.  The outdoor patio is a blast, full of life.  Spend some time with the cassette wall on your way to the restroom, you're bound to find a band from your past.",

The pitcher turns out to be 3-4 glasses, so you can't go wrong - just get to the Windsor early to take advantage of it. And where its sister restaurant Postino's lacks in hard alcohol, the Windsor makes up for it; they have a nice list of whiskeys and bourbons along with mixed drinks.  The food was good. I really loved the Kale salad (with its dried cherries, crunchy almonds, and tangy dressing, it's hard not to love), and the cheddar fondue was especially sharp and flavorful, but the burger that I ate wasn't anything spectacular.   My friends and I were lucky to arrive early, because after 5:30 pm, it looked like there was a wait time of at least 20+ minutes. This especially surprised me because it was a Tuesday. Although, it didn't help that we stayed at our table for so long. The evening was just too lovely, and the patio too perfect to not stay and chat.",

Here is where things went classy, during our dinner they sat a table of 8 adults and a 2nd table of 6 children. As parents we understand, but maybe Windsor 7:30 on a Thursday might not be the best environment for the kids, because kids like to run around. Instead of acting like the kids weren't there, the manager brought over another side of Mac and said thank you for understanding. He didn't say anything about the kids, but it was understood and it was classy.  To top it off when we did get our check, we noticed a generous reduction- again it was something that they didn't have to do, but it is something that we will remember.  we will keep going back!",

It is an ice cream shop.   Very good.  Anyway upon finishing our ice cream they called us in and sat us on the patio.  We were greeted promptly by a nice waitress and ordered. We had a garden vegetable entree and a burger with Mac and Cheese.  Food was wonderful, veggies were delicious.   Burger was devine.  Overall had had a great experience.",

The beer is also cheap by the pitcher so both are a great combo for an easy night out.  Traveling from the East Coast in the middle of March, their open restaurant feel was extremely inviting and makes for a cozy atmosphere to catch up in.    Only downside was the valet parking but I'm told as an outsider that's normal out there.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times, mostly when they are offering a deal or two through their email list. The first time, I wasn't impressed. I remember looking at the menu thinking that I could make most of the entree items at home. After tasting, I was even less impressed. There really wasn't anything on the menu that would make we want to come back.   But then we got a coupon for 2 for 1 entrees on Mondays and Tuesdays in October, and since it's right around the corner we decided to give it another try. I was delighted to find they had changed their menu to include some tasty new items, and I wasn't disappointed with our choices at all.   The Mixed Grain Salad was delicious! I would definitely get that again. It is hearty, sweet, and sour, with an amazing blend of textures that make every bite interesting. It reminded me of a Kashi meal, but so much better.   The next thing we got was the Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich. While it's True that it's not a traditional Banh Mi sandwich in several ways, the most obvious of which is the fact that it comes on a soft sandwich roll instead of a baguette, it was absolutely delicious! The fish was cooked perfectly, and it was juicy, fresh, and flavorful. The side of mac n cheese was just ok. I don't know why, but most of the starchy sides at Windsor seem overly salted. I love a good crunchy topping on my baked mac n cheese, but this seemed to be composed entirely of sea salt.   All in all, I'm really glad they offered a deal or I probably wouldn't have returned. I'm glad I did, and will be going back to try the other new menu items.",

My wife and I met some friends here and sat outside since it was a beautiful day out. The patio is clean and decorated in a simple yet stylish manner. Inside you'll find a beautiful bar and the famous \"cassette tape\" wall leading to the bathrooms and the creamery Churn.   The food and service are both top notch! We started with the Russian Roulettes which was basically a bowl of sauteed peppers... most were pretty mild, but the dish came with the warning that you may stumble upon a HOT one... (thus the name) The porkwich is probably my new favorite sandwich... seriously. EVER.  The cocktail list here is really impressive, and changes often!

Since that salad was pretty much the highlight of my week, I want to add my 2 cents here.    First of all, the components of the salad are listed right on the menu, so if you don't like what's in it, don't order it.  If you like beets, squash, grains, etc., this salad is absolutely the perfect combination of crunchy, hearty, healthy, salty, and a little sweet.  So incredible was this salad that I couldn't even stop eating in time to leave room for ice cream at Churn.  I was very impressed with the vast array of options on the menu here but will probably continue to order the mixed grain salad again and again.  Other stuff about Windsor:  The patio is delightful.  It's not a particularly large patio but it's got a great setup, with plenty of room between tables.  Thank goodness for misters.  I loved that they gave a little bowl of pistachios as soon as we sat down.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant was nothing special (besides the awesome wall of cassette tapes linking Windsor to Churn).",

I ordered the Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich with a side kale salad. Something I appreciated about this place was what you paid for your sandwich or burger was the same price with the added side. The Banh Mi had a great combination of flavors with the honey glaze and the spicy mayo.   My friend and I went for dinner at night and the atmosphere was darker and intimate. The had a large bar area, and we sat in a comfortable booth while it rained outside (to really create that comforting, intimate mood).  Overall, the food was delicious, the mood inside was warming, the drinks were perfectly balanced, and the staff was nice. The only thing I would change was the price.",

What's not to love?  There are lots of choices for my vegetarian self. Windsor has a top-notch veggie burger that I've gotten a few times. One of the servers gave me the helpful suggestion of having it prepared Windsor-style like the regular burgers, and I loved it. They have lots of great sides too. A cup of their daily soup and some creamy mac and cheese made for a great meal during the winter.   Service has been consistently good every time I've visited. I don't get to come here enough since I live in the east valley, but it's always a treat when I do visit.",

    "text": "I've been to Windsor a couple of times for brunch and late lunch. Both times, the food was amazing! For lunch, I got the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich. I honestly had no expectations about this order, because I felt the menu was too simple so I thought I settled with this... but boy was I wrong! The pulled chicken, with all the veggies, and the hazelnuts, tasted wonderful all together! (This review is reminding me that I need to go back just for this sandwich...)  For brunch, my friend and I ordered The Simple Life (she was on a diet) and I had the Highroad Sandwich with a side of Grilled Cheddar Potatoes. The Simple Life was just ok, really as simple as breakfast gets that you can easily make at home. The Highroad, on the other hand... amazing! Coupled with the cheddar potatoes, it was definitely a great combo. We also had a cocktail since they were having the $5 until 5PM deal on the Sunday we went. If you go for brunch, GET THE GRILLED CHEDDAR POTATOES!! You won't regret it.  Parking in the front of the building is very minimal, so make sure to drive around as there are more parking on the back, and on the right side. The only thing I wish Windsor would have was a bigger menu both from brunch and lunch/dinner. Other than that, everything I've had has been great so far.",

A great mix and can taste crab. They have tastey bacon too. As a side I tried the kale salad. Now you should know I think kale is evil but, it is good for you, so...  wow. I think I found a new craving. Was so good I'm not sure kale was in it!  I just can't wait to try the next thing on the menu so I can rave about it as well.   WTG Windsor!",

Both got drinks - my husband's (a Paloma?) was really good and my Bloody Mary with all the fixings was good.   But the food still not good. I got the biscuits  and gravy. Gravy was weirdly sweet and gummy - not good. Sausage killed my stomach.   My husband didn't like his either.   Would be best to go for drinks only, in my opinion.   Far better places for food around there and not as expensive either.",

There is an inside area to eat and then the bar, and a sliding window opened up to the outside eating area. The outside had greenery, hanging lights, and a fireplace.   I decided to eat the brunch and got the Simple Life plate which was 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, an English muffin split in half and toasted, and a side of fruit which mainly consisted of apples, cantaloupe, and honeydew. Everything was really good, especially the thick cut bacon! Also, I asked for butter and jam with my English muffin and the strawberry jam was sooo good I couldn't stop eating it.  My mom ordered the Matador which she absolutely loved and raved about. My dad got the chef's special of the day which was an omelet with chorizo in it, which he also loved, and it was pretty big, too. And my sister got a burger with the Mac and cheese for the side, which she let me try and it was pretty good! Might I add that the staff is very friendly and accommodating, too:)  Overall, it was a great meal and it was definitely worth the 30 minute drive! I can't wait to go back and eat some more!",

I like them with a little squeeze of lemon.   Deviled Egg Dip & homemade chips were better than I imagined. I have to figure out how to make this appetizer. I think it would be a big hit with friends.   After all the apps, we were full, so my friend and I ended up splitting the New Orleans baby back rib dinner. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor was smokey with a hint of sweet and heat. We had it with a side of cole slaw. I'm usually a such a lady at the dinner table, but I HAD to lick my fingers a couple times!!   For desert, don't forget to head next door to Churn for some of the best artesian ice cream in town!

    "text": "I actually came here for brunch, but apparently it's only on Sunday's. So just FYI. The lunch menu they were serving seemed somewhat refreshing and very fresh. A huge plus is that they allow dogs on their patio (which is fully covered) and they ALSO have misters that periodically come on to cool you down. It was super helpful today when it was triple digits, ouch!! When I travel across the country with my dog, it's nice to have places like this because I won't leave him in the car.   I started with a no. 22, which is something like a tart blackberry lemonade with vodka as the base. It was absolutely perfect for me because I don't like cocktails very sweet.   My soup & salad combo consisted of wild mushroom soup and a kale/romaine Caesar salad.   Mushroom soup - very dark broth which is perfectly seasoned with a base of mirepoix and vegetable broth I would guess. It had a healthy dose of mushrooms along with carrot chunks and onions. Very light. Perfect for a hot day.  Kale Caesar - romaine lettuce mixed with fresh, crisp kale tossed in a creamy, yet mild, house made Caesar dressing topped with dried capers. They weren't very strong, but they did have a nice salty touch to the dish. I was very pleasantly surprised by the mix actually.   Boyfriend had the 'pork-which' that they almost advertise as their pulled pork sandwich. It came with sweet potato fries that were room temp when we got them, but still good. As for the sandwich, it basically came out like a roast beef sandwich made with pork with burnt bacon on top and tangy mustard. Not a winner.",

The drinks were good--ginger cider and a berry vodka cocktail. The bartender did well with the mix.  But the food was bland. We had the fish and chips, and although crunchy, the fish had no taste (tasted like water...), and the fries were not well seasoned (over salted at the bottom of the basket). I felt overcharged for what was less appetizing than a $5 fish n chips dish, so... Don't order that when you go?",

I understand some places like to have everyone work together but the only problem with that is they don't know if someone checked on a table... After receiving our main course we had some request but by the time a server showed up we were full... So that was disappointing   FOOD AND DRINKS  My sister and I literally try new places for their bloody Mary's and we gave this 6 out 10 mainly because of the pulp (first time I've ever had a pulpy Bloody Mary) not good BUT $5 drinks til 5pm so that's a plus. For apps we ordered the ceviche which was good but stingy on the seafood, the devil eggs chip dip was good but chips were slightly stale, and popcorn corn dogs weren't anything special. They were a little backed up so our main course took awhile but the cheeseburgers and pastrami was alright.   In the end I would not come here again unless it was for drinks before 5 but I'd still recommend it to friends and family to give it a try",

    "text": "The Windsor is my favorite of the Upward Projects restaurants. Their food is very good and reasonably priced for the most part, and they have great cocktails - a lot of them. The atmosphere is very relaxed and I've only ever had wonderful service. The decor is beautiful, and the facilities very clean.  The Monday night Fried Chicken Dinner is a pretty good deal, and the veggie pairing is always on point. The food is standard American fare with good flavors and presentation. But! A warning to the vegetarians, the Windsor's offerings are frustrating. The veggie burger (made of beans and wheat) is more expensive than any of the sandwiches with only one meat, and only a few dollars less than the Crab Cake BLT (made of an animal you pull from the ocean floor with a net and send to Phoenix on a refrigerated airplane hangar; jk it's a freezer patty, but still).   For the price, the salads are probably your best bet, or the soup and salad duo if they happen to have a veggie-friendly soup. The Veggie Stack is tempting, and it's perfectly filling, but it's expensive for what it is (pita, hummus, quinoa, veggies) and feels very much like a labored attempt at vegetarian American food. You can also play it safe getting a smattering of their admittedly great sides.   My final word on the Windsor would be that the french fries are really very good. If you aren't a ketchup fan, they have sriracha you can mix with your ketchup, or order them with a side of sambal mayo.  tl;dr I like this place as a neighborhood happy hour spot or a chill evening over drinks. Their food is not worth it for me. I say that as someone who only rarely eats meat, but I also mean it. The french fries are good. Amen.",

Though the lot to the south of Windsor is large, it has been full, and valet also has a max. Sometimes I've parked at AJs and walked up.   Food:  Though salad restaurants are usually yawnnn.., the Windsor salads are vibrant, interesting and flavorful.  I have ordered various salads and am always glad I did.  I enjoyed the pretzel appetizer with cheese and apples. I think it came with sausage but did not eat that.  The drinks have always been delicious and well made.   Service: Similar to the other Upward Projects restaurants, service is excellent.   The servers provide the bill in a timely manner and are helpful and quick.   Ambiance: trendy, hipster, fun.

    "text": "I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Windsor...   There have been good experiences here, there have been not so good... Sometime friends say \"Let's go to Windsor!\" and I'm like \"Blaaahhhhh... I don't like Windsor that much\" but sometimes I'm like \"Heck yes! Let's go Now!\"   It may just be that the mental roller coaster I ride is to blame, but here's the breakdown:  Stopped in for brunch before and it's pretty solid. They have a build your own bloody mary bar which was a favorite among our group. I did not partake because bloody marys are the devil.   I did however get the cinnamon roll which waaaas.... amazing. You can drizzle your own icing so if you don't like too much then it's your choice to make. I'm pretty sure I used all of it because that's how I live my life... All in. No boundaries. (I'm quite boring actually)   The eggs benedict was good as well. I think I had the one with crab cakes and spinach.   So that's brunch.  I've also been to Windsor for dinner a few times. The burger is very good. I remember liking it.   I was disappointed with the popular Brown bag chicken sandwich though... it wasn't \"my thing\". I know people who like it though... so there's that.   The fried chicken is awesoooome... you can only get it on a certain night though (I can't remember which night) choose mac and cheese as the side and you win dinner. So good. I can't remember having friend chicken that good since leaving The South. Not a restaurant called The South... I'm talking about the Actual South. Florida baby! Represent! *ahem*  moving on...   So that's the food. Mostly very good. I like.   The service has been all over the board. I try to just roll with it...   They have a decent beer selection. Some of the cocktails have been home runs... others have been... whatever the opposite of a home run is...  The atmosphere is trendy but casual. Quite comfortable and unpretentious.  Overall, after writing this, I guess I do like Windsor (at least for today)...   And I leave you with this Pro Tip: Save room for after dinner ice cream at Churn next door. You're Welcome.",

The owners of Postino just can't go wrong I'm convinced. I'm a long time fan of both locations and was super excited when they opened up Windsor as they have a full bar and different, numerous options for food.   Let's start with the interior, love it. Modern with some natural elements; very laid back with an awesome patio that I've actually yet to sit on as I'm usually at the bar or one of the comfy booths as soon as you walk in.  The staff is always on point and friendly without being too in your face which I really love being that I am a server and I don't really need the follow up every 4 minutes. I most recently sat at the bar solo on Wednesday or Thursday and I didn't get the bartender's name but he was really nice without being overbearing.   Food wise? Omnomnom is all I have to say. No, the Backyard burger is awesome. I've only gotten it Classic style but it's delicious! The meat is flavorful and the portion is generous to say the least. I'm also a big fan of their fondue and the Brown Bag (??) Chicken sandwich. Everything tastes fresh and you can't go wrong with Churn next door for the dessert...best Butter Pecan I've ever had.  This area has some solid restaurants and Windsor is no different. Definitely a great spot for lunch during the day or a date at night. Check it out!",

I didn't keep actual track, but it might have been a hour before we got our food from the time we sat down - and it was NOT busy.  There was a nice crowd, but still plenty of open tables, and no wait.    Food also is 4 stars.  I want to love it, but something is just not right.  My summer salad - new on the menu (yes, for summer)  - had too much of the overly acidic dressing.  The pulled pork which I got to-go on my first and prior visit was dry and bland.  I mean, how do you make pulled pork so-so when it's innately delicious?  Overall, still 4 stars b/c the ambience is oh so cool, the wall of audio tapes genius, outdoor patio inviting, and the kid friendly-ness of the place tops everything else.  You'll understand when you get kids...our other options are places like peter piper pizza.",

My first thoughts while walking through this place was gastropub.  The set up and the decor all suggested my initial thoughts.  After glancing over the menu I decided my decision was conclusive.  We decided to sit outside because let's face it one of the pros of living in Phoenix is that you can have lunch outside in January.  It was a beautiful day.     My counter part ordered the Reuben sandwich, which actually looked pretty darn tasty.  I ordered the Windsor burger, topped with caramelized onions and cheese.  Even though my burger was overdone to my request of rare I still ate it anyways because 1. I don't like to waste food, and 2. it was still pretty darn tasty.  The french fries could definitely use improvement though.  They were just blah.     As far as service goes, my server was a pimp!  Very charming and pleasing.  Although it did go a little overboard with the attentiveness of filling up water glasses constantly, not by my server though.  All around I had a pleasant experience with Windsor and if I'm ever in the area again and want to get a solid bite to eat, I wouldn't hesitate to come back.",

    "text": "Great vibe. After you valet the car (you have to- it's the only option) you walk into an outdoor area very similar to postino Arcadia.  Head inside and be greeted by a lovely hostess.  We sat at the bar with a carafe of wine.  All wine is served in a carafe, ala on tap style.  I like this.  The bar is in the center of the restaurant in a super chic way that you can observe what is going on around you and kinda hideout or be seen- the choice is yours.    We were seated in what I think was the best seats in the house.  It was in a corner booth that was right at the corner of the restaurant.  Once we all slid into our booth seats, we all agreed it was like hunkering down in a basement somewhere on a leather couch.   We were introduced to Dan, the super slim, urban hipster server with a nice face and a witty personality.  When asked if my burger would be better with fries or mac n cheese, he asked me how often I eat burgers with mac n cheese? uhh, so yeah, I ordered the mac n cheese--- GREAT choice!   We started with the Smorgash board that had pita, cheese, the most kale chips and largest kale chips I have ever seen, hummus, some veggies and smoked salmon-- it was interesting enough, but I probably won't be ordering that again.  But since they just opened, I am happy to try anything on the menu!  Entrees included the waldorf salad that was only so-so, it was called \"a bit too much\" by a friend, the Barley salad was a huge hit as was the corn chowder.  My burger was good, I recommend going easier on the caramelized onions.  I felt like it started to taste more like a dessert before I even got half way through it.  After we ate, relaxed and Dan check on us the perfect amount of time, we walked through and headed next door to Churn for dessert.  We passed the bar, said hello to a few friends we ran into, observed the outdoor seating one more time, and then walked though a hallway decorated in old cassette tapes, that was awesome!   At the end of the hallway was a bathroom marked \"ladies and gents\"- I absolutely despise shared bathrooms.  So that grossed me out thoroughly.  But as we made the turn, I saw the candies and ice cream that awaited me just around the corner....",

We went for Mother's Day brunch at noon and were seated immediately upon arrival.  It was busy just not over packed with people on a wait.    My only complaint was the mimosa I ordered was more juice than sparkling wine.  So, when I requested a second glass I asked for just a splash of oj and they gladly accomodated.    We started with the cheddar cheese fondue.  It was SO good and I love the pretzel bread, apples, and sausage served with it.  For my entree I ordered the Brown Bag Chicken sandwich.  It was phenom!  I am so happy to find a shredded chicken salad that is NOT drenched in mayo.  I wasn't too crazy about the kale salad, it just tasted like, well, kale.    I will be back many times and look forward to exploring the menu! Oh, be sure to check out Churn next door!",

It's in my favorite part of town, has an ice cream shop attached and has a wall full of cassette tapes that include gems like \"Amy's Workout Jamz\". How can you NOT love it? The atmosphere is an absolute home run. I just can't wait for it to cool down so I can experience the expansive patio.   The staff are friendly, fun and helpful, the beer is good, and the food is delicious. On my last visit I had the Banh Mi Sandwich, which was perfect. The sides are interesting and delicious, and items like the mac & cheese and the broccolini should not be missed.   Windsor is one of those places I can't stop talking about, and with good reason. It's the perfect mix of location, good food and fun, quirky atmosphere that really makes it a local gem. Go. Now!",

So I decide to bring in a couple clients for lunch to talk business and enjoy lunch. Well instead we (5 business professionals in suits) got seated at a round booth fit for a family with children at pizza joint. Music was blasting we could not hear each other talk. We asked 3 times to have the music turned down and they would turn it down 1 notch. When I addressed the manager she stated that it was already much lower than it normally was...but the last 4 or 5 times I've been here the music was no where near this disruptive. We're in Phoenix trying to enjoy a relaxing lunch not in Scottsdale! Majority of the lunch patrons were business professionals from nearby businesses. Music this loud is not relaxing. And I was probably one of the youngest patrons so don't get me wrong I love my share of loud music. But during lunch amidst a busy day is not the time. And if the music was not annoying enough the flies made up for it. We had 5-7 BIG flies swarming our table at any given time. Constant swatting and covering our food...gross. The food is good nothing spectacular but good. Definitely not worth dealing with the music and flies though. This is probably my last visit.",

Minus a few screaming babies, the atmosphere was good and the place was hoppin'. My only complaint is that I wish the bar was built onto the patio as well. We had a hard time deciding what to eat because many things on the menu looked interesting (in a good way)...we ended up opting for an appetizer and splitting an entree. The fondue platter and the halibut sandwich were pretty good. We approved of the wine on tap as well.  The service was outstanding and the 'water boy' as we were calling him was very informative :) He told us all about the place and the menu (hopefully he will be there if you go)!  Also if you like alt rock, you won't be disappointed with the music and it is quite loud, which I didn't mind...it helped drown out the screaming baby next to us. Another bonus is the neat ice cream shop next door for dessert afterward!  I will be back again for sure.",

    "text": "Oh Windsor, how I wanted to love you! With Postino being one of my favorite restaurants ever, I had high hopes for Windsor.   It feels, well, like Postino. But not as good.   The patio is comfortable. It was a PERFECT evening so that made it super nice, and the chairs are cute, but it's kind of plain. Again, like Postino, but without that extra something special. Although the perimeter fence is cool, with the different widths of wood.   For starters we got the fondue, which was good. Just good. The cheese - although piping hot - was kind of gritty (which happens with pure cheddar). Maybe mix something creamier in there?  I got the chicken sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. The mac was yummy. The chicken sandwich was bland. And I love me a chicken sandwich. Even of the plain ole' breast-bun-lettuce-tomato-mayo variety.   Boyfriend and boyfriend's mom got the halibut sammich, which we had heard was bomb. Again, good. Not great. Disappointing for a Postino affiliate. Kale salad was fine. Coleslaw was fine. Nothing knocked our socks off.  Our service was initially really slow. We didn't get noticed for a while, and then our drinks took ages. Everything after that was right on key, and our waitress was well informed and friendly.   My favorite part of the meal was my cocktail - the No. 89. It was the perfect blend of strong and refreshing. I would definitely be back for beverages! I'd really like to try the wines on tap as well.  All in all, it kind of seems like they built Windsor for all the Postino overflow. \"Hey, your wait is going to be an hour, but if you go right across the street there is a Postino Jr. consolation prize.\"  I'll definitely give it another go after they've had some time to get settled, but until then, I'll be back for drinks, and eat elsewhere.",

The Porkwich was so good I haven't stopped talking about it (apparently something I inherited from my grandfather who talks about a meal he ate days, weeks, months, and years later).  This sandwich along with the mac n cheese was so good I couldn't stop eating even though I was full.  The \"chips\" appetizer was also super yummy though I'm pretty sure I had my limit of fat, calories, and sodium with this one meal.  But damn I'm glad I don't live here cause I'd be a HOUSE.  And the interior is great, service was great, but the best part about the place aside from our meal was the wall of cassette tapes.  Awesome idea.  Would totally visit again.",

Water immediately, drink orders within 30 seconds of being seated and our server was attentive but not annoying. No. 17 cocktail was tasty. Refreshing and not too syrupy sweet like most cocktails. We ordered the cheddar fondue to start. Great idea, poor execution. They lit a tea light at the table to melt the liquid cheddar to warm it but it never really got warm so just thick liquid room temp cheddar was the result. I would imagine maybe they could keep it warm in the kitchen so it's ready upon serving? Zap it even? The pretzel bread that came with it was amazing. For an entree, I got the porkwich. Really good but really salty, I think that's just what you get when you order a sandwich with three types of pork though. I ordered fries as my side so I'm sure that didn't help the salty flavor. My boyfriend ordered ribs and I got a taste, the sauce was very rich with a tiny kick which was unique. Churn is right next door so that's a plus as well. My only disappointment is the limited menu, it's about one page & I like to have options. But still, there were a couple other dishes I will definitely try in the future.",

Mid century vintage lighting, paired with an entire wall treatment made out of old cassette tapes...whats not to love? Killer music.  We started with two ice cold no.89's and they hit the spot, very smooth, mild pear taste, perfect cocktail for a summer night. We also chose to sit inside.  Our first item was the double dip, very good! I hate eggs, but I liked the Cobb dip anyway, it was that good. The posole salsa was delicious and my fave of the two, paired with the kettle chips it hit the spot.  For our entrees we selected the mixed grain salad (excellent vegetarian option) and it was light, but substantial enough to be a meal. The orange basil dressing is fabulous without being too sweet. I also order a side of the house smoked salmon which was incredible, best I've had, my only complaint would be the portion size, very small, but maybe my opinion is skewed because I enjoyed it so much I wanted more... We also ordered the Porkwich which was very generously portioned! Holy smokes it was large, wasn't sure how it could be maneuvered to get a bite, but we managed and thoroughly enjoyed it! Here's a tip: once you have picked up the Porkwich, don't put it down! You wont be able to arrange it properly again :) Also opted for a side of mac & cheese, it was good, and a nice departure from typical \"side\" offerings. Great staff from host to server! The only element missing from this picture are fabulous deserts...coming soon I hope?  All and all great new spot, next time, and there will be a next time soon, we're sitting on the patio it looks fab :)",

From a relaxing, eye-pleasing decor, to misted outdoor seating, to a cute little ice cream shoppe in the same building, to the clever \"wall of cassettes\", this place has lots of charm without overdoing the kitsch. Servers are topnotch, friendly and attentive. But the food is what won me over... these guys are onto something. In two visits my two sandwiches were both wows.. the Burger, Windsor style, is amazing with caramelized onions, a garlic aioli and cheddar on an artisan roll. There are lots of places that smother sandwiches in lots of ingredients, but they don't always work out... this one does. Today, tried the Porkwich.... was almost brought to tears by the \"Tenderbelly\" bacon over two other kinds of pork, cole slaw and \"gold sauce\" (no idea what's in the sauce but I liked it and you will too). Got mac and cheese as the side dish and it was really special, creamy and flavorful.  I will be back... again and again!",

After I arrived, it was at least 10 minutes until the server came to get my drink order, so that kind of irked me.  Our server did get a little more attentive as the meal progressed, thankfully.  We had the corn dog appetizer to start with.  I wish the batter had been cooked just a tad bit more so that they were more crunchy, but they were still pretty good.  They also came with fried pickles, which I love.  I requested a side of ranch to use for dipping instead of the yellow mustard that came with the appetizer.  For me entree, I had the shortribs.  If shortribs are on a menu, I will almost always order that.  With this dish, the meat was cooked very well and was tasty, but there was something I didn't love about the accompaniments.  They were too earthy or something, I can't put my finger on it.  So, it was good, but not as good as I was hoping for.  I've only heard good things about Windsor from friends, so I would go back for a second time, but it's not somewhere that I'm going to put on the top of my restaurant list.",

    "text": "This is an elderly gentleman's backyard grill and resort casual cocktail party.  We got the double dip appetiser - nice, but not stunningly memorable - and I had the burger. It, too, was nice, but I cannot recall anything about it that stood out. Like a Delux burger except with decent meat was a thought that raced through my head.   Note on the menu: it's simple, focussing on salads, burgers, mac & cheese, etc. Again, elderly gentleman's backyard grill. I felt left wanting for something a tad more creative outside the appetiser section.  Service is where the ding comes - wait staff was excellent, but I was ignored for a good amount of time while waiting to be noticed to be seated, this being after I was told where to wait to be put on a list to wait to be seated (no gripes about the wait - was quick and we were offered drinks to pass the time).  The best part is by far Churn, the ice-cream shop next door (owned by the same owner). Wouldn't object to coming back, but wouldn't suggest it either.",

The house smoked salmon was among the best smoked salmon I've had, although kale was totally burnt and there wasn't enough cheese.    Based on my love of Postino, I went back again, and mostly changed my tune.  Porkwich and crab cake blt are SO good, and you have to get the church potatoes, they're unreal.  Drinks are delicious but still expensive.  Plus the space is hip, the bathrooms are cool, the wall of tapes is super rad, and the ice cream next door at Churn is amazing.  Salted caramel please!  Parking can be tight. Also... come on Windsor (and Postinos) - who can make it to Happy Hour before 5pm???  Please push to 6pm!!!",

It's dark inside...that seemed a bit extreme after sunset. The fondue is great. I loved the pretzel bread that came with it. The side street (Central Ave) sneaks up on you...so be on the lookout--especially if you are going there after dark!",

I had high expectations for this place as the owners here are the same as my beloved Postino's. The food was great and did not disappoint. Their wine menu contained great options and the food menu contained alot of unique dishes, which I dig. I chose the mixed grain salad which was perfect, seasonally fresh items which all blended very nicely. The boyfriend had their burger and mac and cheese which I could tell he genuinely enjoyed, which is not easily accomplished. We passed on dessert this time, but I've had a Churn red-velvet ice cream sandwich before and it was uhhhmazing! We will definitely be returning here soon! (:",

The staff is nice and attractive, just like at Postinos, but the food lacks a central theme and left a lot to be desired. The music was an odd compliation and at times I thought someone might be playing a 'mixed tape' from the early 90's. The volume of the music was adjusted up and down all evening. The full bar is appreciated but the wine is all 'on tap'- so the red wine comes out cold. Also there is not a pinot grigio on the wine list simply a white 'blend' (no thanks!) The prices of food and drink at the Windsor were higher than those at Postino, and I think next time I head out I will just travel a little further South on Central and go to Postinos.",

The burger was juicy and med-rare just how I wanted it. We got a side of church potatoes which were creamy delicious potatoes almost like a gratin.

Both were excellent and filling - I had the cucumber drink and my husband had the watermelon drink (very refreshing!).

We ordered the Greek appetizer, which is very common in many places, but the presentation of this one, made it quite different from the rest.  On the bottom was hummus, topped with traditional Greek style cucumber, tomato with light olive oil dressing, and a side of Tzazitki and pita.  Unique and quite good.  More pita would have been nice.  For lunch we ordered the Porkwich, recommended by the waitress and a side of the Mac and Cheese. The sandwich was delcious, but the Mac and cheese lacked \"punch\" and I was not wowed by it.  I'll save that for the Tuck Shop next time.  We also ordered the ribs and they were tender, tasty and really had a nice unique flavor.  We had a side of the potatoes and OMG, they were delicious.  I really wanted to try the Crab Cake BLT and will definitely do that next time.  The best part...CHURN.  I love how it is connected to the restaurant and you can get an entirely different experience at the same location.  We had a pricey \"create your own\" sundae and enjoyed it on the beautiful patio with misters outside.  It was very nice to be able to leave the restaurant, but not and enjoy an outdoor experience with ice cream in 105 degrees and feel very comfortable.   Enjoy!",

One of our party ordered short ribs and a sandwich came instead. The waitress apologized for putting the order in wrong and let us keep the sandwich! I ordered the apple brandy cocktail and it was amazing! Not too sweet. For dinner we ordered the white fish bon mi and brown bag chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. The fries were sweet and salty, with what seems to be house made ketchup. The Mac and cheese needed pepper. The bon mi has refreshing. Not served on a French roll, but definitely something I would get again. The chicken sandwich is a cold sandwich, filled with nuts and fruit... Delicious. I was blown away when I went to the restroom and there was a line... The employees in line let me cut ahead! The music played was hip/alternative; added to the environment.

Crab cake were cooked juuuuuust right, not too much breading, just the right ratio.  Both of these items are good when done well, and dissapointing when not.

    "text": "Windsor, the newest addition to the Demarco list of hip places in the Valley (until Gilbert Postino opens next to Liberty Market).   Not that I know anything about classic cocktails, but I've begun to dive into this new revival of old school, classic beverages. Winsdor has a great take on this new trend, and does the \"pub food\" to match. I've been to Windsor a handful of times, had every cocktail on the menu and I've also tried a few of the beers and wines. My favorite cocktail is the No. 35. The combination of scotch, St. Germain and lemon has an incredible balance and is an easy and strong drink. The wines at Windsor are all on tap (a new trend in New York and California). I am a fan of the wines on tap, for the price, quality and the amount of waste (nearly zero) that the restaurant has on such a drink. The food at Windsor is a little more than elevated bar food. My fiancee and I love getting the Russian Roulettes for a bar snack, which consists of roasted green peppers. Most are mild, but you'll get that one that has a bite! For a little heftier of a plate we will share the Smorgasbord which has a house cured salmon, white bean dip, cheese, nuts, etc. Those two are perfect for an afternoon of cocktails and snacks.  Like Postino, they offer glasses of wine, pitchers of beer and specialty cocktails for only $5 before 5pm.   Some people like the vibe and decor, others seem to think it's a little too cliche. I think the decor and design is excellent. Small aspects remind me of Postino and stick with the Demarco way of restaurant design. However, some of the themes are reminiscent of the vintage cocktail revival and reminds me of the craft cocktail bar, Craft & Commerce in souther California.  Overall, this is a great place for a casual and quiet afternoon snack and libation. If it wasn't 35 miles from my house you could probably find me there a couple of times a week.  Nice job Craig, and staff. Keep up the great work and I look forward to seeing Postino Gilbert open in the beginning of the year.",

Windsor is super classy and has great food for a great price. I have to say they have one of the best fries, cut skinny and made super crispy. I'm a big lover of french fries so that says a lot! I usually share a Backyard Burger with the hubs and we've had it both the classic style and windsor style and both are worth ordering! You really can't beat $5 pitchers for their happy hour, but if it's not happy hour they're still only like $7! I always go for the hoegaarden but they have a great selection.The mac and cheese is crazy good too, I would recommend giving it a try! On a side note, they have great coffee and the ambiance is freakin romantic. Great date night spot!",

I heard Windsor and Churn were opening up and I always love to check out a new place, especially when it is owned by someone with a good track record. When we pulled up I knew I was in love.  It's the ambiance and atmosphere of a restaurant that gives you a certain feel, a certain experience. Between the friendly and stylish staff, the people, the stung lights on the patio, and the wooden benches surrounded by catci pots they nailed it. The wall of cassette tapes and the saying son the walls were also a great touch. Our wait on a Fri night was surprisingly short and we had a cocktail waitress take care of us in the meantime. The drinks are kind of expensive but the No. 11 was tasty enough to warrant the price tag.  My boyfriend and I got a great seat on the patio. Privacy. We shared a kale caesar salad. Usually won cannot be all too wowed by a salad but damn was this good. What a long way a clever idea like cheddar croutons can go. Then we split a the brown bag chicken sandwich with friend okra. Tasty. A perfect amount of food for a meal, you know the portions everywhere but American serves? lol.  Everything was great and going next door to eat Banana ice cream from Churn was the cherry on top. Cheers to your success.",

It was Friday a little after 5:00 p.m. and the place was packed.  The wait for a table wasn't long and both the bartender and server were very good.  Our beers (Stella Artois on draft) were cold and refreshing.  We started with the loaded chips with bacon and they were so darn tasty!  I had the brown bag chicken sandwich since someone here on Yelp recommended it (thanks Jessica W.).  Sandwich was large and the chicken was so tender.  My side was kale salad (never had kale salad before but now I'm hooked).  Husband had the crab cake sandwich.  He said it was excellent and his cole slaw was the best!  I CAN'T WAIT to go back!  Good job Windsor . . . see you soon.  Did I mention you can eat at the bar?  Good place for people watching and you can also see the chefs hustling back in the kitchen.",

    "text": "Windsor is a fun, lively bar/restaurant with a great vibe and good food, all at a reasonable price.  We started out with drinks at the bar while we waited for a table.  Our bartender was great though the drink options were limited.  Frankly I found the cocktail listing confusing with some odd numbered nomenclature instead of standard drink names.    we started out with the kale chips that seem to be popular.  They were just ok.  Kale doesn't exactly make a good chip so it seems like a misnomer.  There wasn't a whole lot of flavor - just a papery texture and salt.  They were worth a try, but I'm more interested in some of their other appetizers next time.   My date and I both had difficulty narrowing our dinner selections because so many sound so good.  He got the halibut sandwich with fried okra while I got the country vegetable chopped salad.  Both were fantastic.  We both appreciated the use of fresh, local ingredients and the attention paid to flavor without overdoing it.  The halibut sandwich had the perfect balance of cilantro and a spicy sambol mayo to make it not your ordinary fish sandwich.    We loved the decor - cozy, not too loud, unpretentious.  Service from the hostess to bar to table service was attentive, friendly, and fast.  The music was fun, and we had a good time trying to figure out how old we were when some songs came on - a nice walk down memory lane.  Definitely will be back to Windsor to experiment with their menu.",

The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They apparently do some sort of team serving (or at least that's how I was treated during a weekday happy hour). This is fine because we never had to wait to order another round or anything like that, but at the same time, I was never sure who to flag down, or who the tip was going to, etc.  The fondue pretzel appetizer is pretty good, but not spectacular. It's served with apple and sausage which is a bonus. Great fondue is simply hard to come by. The kale Caesar salad and veggie stack sandwich, however, were absolutely to die for. Delicious.   The biggest issue: I felt pressured into ordering a second drink. And by pressured I mean the waitress told me she had rang in another drink for me before happy hour was over... Typically this wouldn't be a big deal but 1. I hadn't asked, and 2. I explicitly said I didn't want to drink because I had work to do that night...so it put me off a bit. Aside from that, the experience was great and I'll definitely be back.",

It has a square, horseshoe style bar in the center of the restaurant. These are always the best designed bars. Great for comfort, for conversation and people watching.  One of their walls is full of old cassette tapes. Very cool idea.   The owners of Postino own Windsor. They obviously know a lot about the business, because they did an amazing job with Postinos. And one of the best things about Windsor is it is nothing at all like Postino, yet another amazing job.   I love the healthy menu. Lots of vegitarian choices, and salads.  I have tried the Kale salad, Grain Salad, the Vegitarian Stack.  All great, fresh ingredients.  I also love that they offer some small bar snacks. These are great salty items, that are good to offer people while sitting at the bar.  Another thing I love is they have wine by the glass on tap. This is great for a glass of wine, if your not sharing a bottle. And it helps the environment.   The staff is  very friendly, and well trained. They have remembered me the few times I have been there. Which always makes me feel welcome. Windsor is by far one of my new favorite hot spots in the neighborhood.",

The bar was great fun, with a good selection of craft beers, reasonably priced.  After about 30 minutes, we were seated in a cozy, corner booth.  The service was amazing, with several people consistently stopping by to make sure everything was attended to.  We ordered: Backyard Burger with Fried Okra Bacon Cheeseburger with Kale Salad Crab Cake BLT with Mac & Cheese Pastrami Reuben with Jo's Church Potatoes  Everything was delicious and prepared as ordered.  The burgers were booth cooked perfectly and they got the bacon nice and crispy which is always a plus in my book.  The fried okra (one of my favorite sides) was awesome.

Our waitress was awesome - I loved how she sat down next to me to take my order - it was a personal touch!  The blackberry lemonade was not too sweet - it was all pretty perfect, and I loved the atmosphere outside on the patio - lots of coverage from the sun, it felt great!  I want to try the iced cream place next door next time - Churn.",

I ordered the Crab Cake BLT because they were out of the fresh fish of the day. Bummer. The crab cake BLT came with jumbo lump crab cakes with Tender Belly bacon, lettuce, tomato & whole grain mustard remoulade. It was pretty good but the crab was a very small amount. I eat a lot lol I ordered the mac and cheese as my side. It was decent.   My dad ordered the Picnic Kebobs which came with hicken, pork, shrimp, & mixed veggie with spicy pepper dip, gold sauce & grilled pita. He said it was a perfect amount of food for him since he eats light meals. He enjoyed it.  My mom ordered the Backyard Burger Classic Style which came with sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion & pickle and she got a side of french fries. Her meal was AMAZING! The burger was juice and full of flavor. The fries were nice and crispy.  I like the atmosphere of Windsor, the decorations, and the staff. The food had a pretty nice variety but not my favorite.",

We shared beignets and cinnamon rolls at the table - cinnamon roll is HUGE and one of the best I've ever had - not too doughy or cakey, very rich and decadent, soooo delish. The beignets were incredible and could certainly stand up to a plate from Cafe Dumonde - and their salted caramel dipping sauce?? Omg... I had the egg man sandwich which was sooo tasty as well - really great siraccha aioli on a delicious brioche bun with egg, bacon, tomato, spinach and sprouts and these cheddar potatoes that were out of this world. Several others in our group had the biscuits and gravy which they loved and a few others had eggs Benedict that they chewed down on as well. Cocktails were fabulous to boot! I had the number 02 which was a perfect blend of all of the flavors as described and not too sweet. The number 45 was a hit at our table too along with the Bloody Mary bar. Wowza. This place rocks!!! Wish I lived here so I could go back regularly!!",

I not a stickler for all rules, but I did see something during my last visit that was of concern.  A patron sat on the (dog friendly) patio.  She and her dog shared a bench seat and, with the dog, took up two tables.  The dog owner enjoyed her cocktail and lunch while her K9 companion (I don't think it was a \"service dog\") cuddled and were admired by the staff.   According to Maricopa County Health Code, a \"Dog Friendly\" patio is allowed, but the dog must stay on a leash, on the ground, not on the seating, in the lap, or near the table top containing food and reusable serving ware.  I suggest the management of Windsor familiarize themselves and their staff of these Health Code rules.  Thanks!",

Parking is easy. I entered from the back of the restaurant, which is a poorly designed entry. It's dark, and you can't really see the painted logo on the door. When I get in, there's no hostess area that I can find. A waiter stopped me and found me a table. Definitely more of a bar, not a restaurant.   I came here specifically for the fried chicken. Im a sucker for good fried chicken!  I ordered a hard cider (they only have one, and none on tap), fried chicken, mac and cheese. The cider was fine, a little dry for my taste. The fried chicken appears to be skin on, which is a plus. Unfortunately, the flavor was lacking at best. I think they're brining the chicken, because the meat was juicy and had a good flavor, but the breading was flavorless. It also seems like they fried it too hot, because there was a definite burnt flavor. The mac and cheese was also very disappointing. It tasted like just mac, almost no cheese. Maybe it was just a very mild cheese?  Zero creaminess. The biscuit was fine, but again, lacking flavor.   The service was good, so not a one star review.",

Windsor never lets us down as our go-to.   Granted, we mainly come here on weeknights when it's not crowded. On weekends it can be a little too busy and loud for our liking. Something to keep in mind if you prefer a quiet dinner!   Burgers are my absolute favorite food, and I am a self-proclaimed burger connoisseur. I believe Windsor makes one of the best hamburgers in the U.S. - hands down! Be sure to get it \"Windsor style\". You won't regret it.",

Everything from the ambiance to the drinks to the food to the people! I've never met a friendlier, cooler staff. I've never had such great service CONSISTENTLY every time I've visited a restaurant. The menu is small, but perfect. There isn't an item I've tried I didn't like.   You don't have to be super cool to eat here, but you will feel super cool if you do eat here!   Here's three pictures I've taken of the loaded chips, the best loaded chips of any restaurant I've ever had. I posted three of the probably 5 million times I've eaten it just to engrain it in your brain.   You wild if you don't try it.",

I'm a big fan of Joyride, Federal pizza and Postino but The Windsor isn't on par in my opinion.  It was great at one time though.  For one, they got rid of the blood orange cocktail that I loved.  Second: The crab cake BLT was mushy and a mayonnaise tasting mess!  It used to be really crispy and well contained but now it's meh.  Third: We we're halfway through the poke appetizer ( really good ), when they brought out the entrees.  Very amateurish in terms of dinning.  That's restaurant basics 101 right?  Fourth: my wife's $11 cocktail tasted like it had zero alcohol, weak!  Fifth: The main server we got, had the personality of someone that isn't quite ready for prime time, zero personality!  Thank god the other female server checked on us!  We won't be back, too many great places to eat at now Windsor!!!  You've lost your edge!",

I love their concepts and menu.   But the food is okay, not spectacular....it is just \"good\". What I think bothers me about their food is just a lack of flavor....I think they just need to kick it up a notch.  I've had the Kale Salad and the Mixed Grain Salad. Both are good. The fresh veggies they use are snappy and great. But I think the dressings are a bit bland - if they were just a bit more flavorful, I'd like them a lot more.  Today I had the Porkwich Sandwich - and with the ingredients, I thought it would be spectacular. But it was just good.  And I had the Kale salad, which was good...but again, could have been more flavorful...really just a bit more lemon juice or zest would have kicked it up a notch and made it great.     I honestly think the Executive Chef needs to beef up the flavors (herbs, spices, etc.) & he'd have a fabulous menu.  For instance, on the Porkwich....it has pork and pork belly with a coleslaw & a sweet sauce on it. If the pork had been grilled with a nice flavorful rub, that would have given it just a bit more kick and flavor and it would have been incredible.",

I also don't mind if you are cooler, more hipster or read more Kerouac than me.  I just don't want to feel like I'm inconveniencing someone for a meal that comes out of my wallet in the end.

I love the cassette tape wall in the hallway to the bathroom (fun to reminisce while you wait since there are only two unisex bathrooms). They're labled as a \"gastropub\", fancy-speak for high-end bar food.   I was curious to try the controversial (some have loved, some have not) mixed grain salad. I was eyeing the porkwich, but I also appreciate a healthy meal (I love home-made kale chips, if that gives you a good idea of my tolerance for healthy stuff), so my friend and I decided to split a couple dishes. While I was hoping for a little more (in terms of flavor maybe), I did enjoy the mixed grain salad. Luckily we were splitting another dish because while feeling healthy, I did not feel full.  For the second dish, we had the veggie stack. It wasn't quite what I pictured (not really a \"stack\"), but it was very tasty. The hummus and green goddess dressing gave it some good flavors.

You can get a mini pitcher of Pimm's cup (enough for 2 servings and then some) for only $5!

The one standout thing about this place is the service.  All the workers are friendly and go out of their way to help you.  Also, the manager (I think) was just walking around and noticed that the steak of one person in my party had been undercooked (not raw, just not they way it was ordered).  The person didn't have a problem with it and didn't say anything but the manager somehow noticed out of the corner of his eye and offered to remake it then took it off the bill.  It really was outstanding service.  All the food that I had was very good.  Its not phenomenal food but is very good nonetheless.  Burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc.  It's just basic bar food stepped up a notch.  I just wish I lived closer to this place so I don't know when I'll be able to make it back.

I had the crab cake BLT...it was big and served on a very good hoagie type bun...the tomato was ripe and there was a nice amount of it...the bacon was crispy (but crumbled?) and the lettuce was shredded.

The atmosphere was just right for a date, not awkwardly silent, but not too loud to have a nice conversation. The menu was manageable, yet still had something for everyone. She had the veggie stack, which sounds terrible to me and loved it. I got the loaded chips, a hot dog, and macaroni and cheese (I felt like eating like a 9 year old... an overweight 9 year old).  It was delicious. The service was great too, not one thing to complain about. I give the credit for this successful date to Windsor. Needless to say I have already locked in another date.

My husband got the porkwich. I guess if you're gonna get pork then go all out with this one. It was good, but it was no Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich.  Go next door to Churn when you're done and support local businesses.  The only cons I have is the parking situation and the loud music. There are so few parking spots and they go quickly. I assume staff takes most of the spots which leaves valet. I have no problem paying for parking, but I don't feel like I have a choice.",

Two of my friends and I went to a late dinner on a Friday night and got in under 20 minutes.  I adored my brown bag chicken sandwich and grilled veggies and picked off my friend's church potatoes (potatoes au gratin) when she started raving about it. It's a little pricy, but quality usually is, and I'm of the opinion that it's worth it. Awesome experience and I'm sooooo going back.",

Fantastic atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Lighting is dim and intimate indoors with rustic seating areas and large booth perfect for groups getting drinks together. The outdoor patio is sectioned off in a covered area with tables and smaller seats while an uncovered area hosted seating for peeps who rode their bikes in.  The drinks are pretty yummy. If you're into fruity, girly cocktails there isn't much to choose from, but for a more mature, grown-u beverage, you're in luck. Hit the happy hour (which sadly ends at 5pm).  It gets a tad loud and it difficult to tell the wait staff apart from the customers because they're all in street clothes but they're very attentive and sweet. We ordered the fondu plate and it was great. Pretzels, sausage, apples and the cheese... perfect for sobering up a bit from those yummy cocktails.",

I had a piece and it was nice and juicy. The service there is impeccable. They actually accidentally served our order of chicken to another table and apologized in advance. We didn't even realize because it didn't seem like we were waiting very long before we got our food. When we got the check we realized they had comped us for that meal.",

We didn't know what we were getting and the first taste of the chips w/ the toppings was a party in my mouth. The potato chips are thick and cooked to perfection. The chips are topped with blue cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, chipotle sauce.  Layers of flavor!  One of the best things I've eaten in a while!  The pulled pork sandwiches are sooo good. \"Different\" type of bbq sauce. Not sweet. Rather it had more of a mustardy, savory flavor.   My family feels that they could have omitted the ham on the sandwich.  The mac and cheese was good. Not great, but good.  The wild salmon was good as was the side of veggies.  Overall, great meal. Great atmosphere. We sat out back.  Love the trees, the lighting, and the comfy chairs! oh....service there is amazing!  The servers know what they're doing.

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place out!  It's always busy when I drive by, and seems like the cool new place to be at.  However, I was somewhat disappointed with the menu options.  I didn't get much time to check out the outside area, but it looks like a great patio to enjoy some drinks once the weather cools down.  It's definitely a hipster scene, and they nailed it with the neighborhood bar atmosphere.  After being seated, I attempted to read the menu.  I'm all about mood lighting, but it was a tad TOO dark in here.  As I struggled to read the menu in the dim lighting I looked up, and happened to notice two other customers who had whipped out their cell phones to use as flashlights in an effort to see the menu.  As I skimmed through the menu I quickly realized mine and my boyfriend's menu options were VERY limited.  *Quick Tip* If you don't eat pork, your menu options are limited by close to half!   They do serve a Veggie Stack sandwich, but that just didn't fit my mood that day.  I've never ordered a salad as a main dish, but settled on the Country Vegetable Chop with an extra boiled egg and my boyfriend ordered the Backyard Burger (Windsor Style).  I'll admit, my salad was pretty tasty.  I loved the addition of crispy okra on top of the salad, served with the perfect amount of ranch dressing.  The Backyard Burger's carmelized onions make the burger, and pairs well with the garlic aioli.  I was tempted to get an order of the mac and cheese after I saw it at the table next to me, but decided I would save this for another trip in an effort to give this place another try, maybe with the Veggie Stack as my main dish.  Also, the waiter recommended a side of ranch with the fried okra, and I have to agree it was pretty tasty this way, especially for a saucy girl like myself.  I love dipping sauces!  With a very attentive waiter on a busy Saturday night service was great.  Don't forget to head towards the unisex restrooms and sneak a peek at the wall made of cassette tapes!  I'll wait to try this place again once the weather cools off so I can enjoy the outside seating!",

My husband and I went for lunch and sat at the bar which is without a doubt the best seat in the house, thanks to bar tenders Roman and Matt and the open wall between the bar and patio, which essentially gave us outside seating on a beautiful winter afternoon in Phoenix. I have been on a quest for the best pastrami sandwich in the valley and found it here. If you are looking for quantity, go to Chompies, but if you are looking for a reasonably sized sandwich full of flavor, then Windsors should be on your list of places to go. There is a nice list of sides that are included with your entree.   As a side I had the macaroni and cheese. It was good, but I make my own mac and cheese from scratch and would be willing to make an arrangement with Windsor and share the recipe!  My husband had the Windsor burger with bacon and a side of french fries and had no complaints. Happy hour until 5:00 includes $5 pitchers of a small but good collection of beer, a glass of wine, or unique cocktails, which we were given small samples of as they were made (I told you... the bar has the best seats!)  We do not live close to the central corridor but will definitely make it back to Windsor soon  so that we can experience the good company of Matt and Roman and their palatial delights!",

The structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor.  The bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space.  The patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates.  We tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters.  The double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though I almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful.  The mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though I might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it.  The wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles.  Again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges.  In any event, we'll be there far too often for our own good!",

We also had a nice brown pag chicken sandwich and a side of mac and cheese which is almost always too ironic for me but it was very tasty. All in all an excellent experience. Parking was a hassle and an annoyance-valet parking is probably the only bad thing that the owners of this place inflict on the customers (here and at the other stores they own).

Had a hint of spice to it that went well with the garnish on top of the fish. Definitely worth a try if you like a flavorful grilled fish. Service is always great here and the ambience is hip and cool.",

Our waiter, Jacob, was so attentive, friendly and accommodating with our babies! Austin was awesome too-- totally on top of it.   Here's what we ordered: Cheese fondue: delicious. The cheese was great and pretzel was so good.  Grain salad: really unique but excellent. Had a slight curry taste. Not very much lettuce but so good Chicken pot pie: probably my favorite. Not too heavy but a very flavorful sauce and great crust. The veggies were perfectly done too.  Cocktails: you can't go wrong! We tried the blackberry lemonade, the cucumber one, and the watermelon one. All were really terrific. Very smooth. Not overly sweet.   I highly recommend this place!",

It has excellent decor with great looking walls and art all over.  It's a very modern hipster look.  The feel is very laid back.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating and the whole place feels very open and flows well in and out.    The food is straight up fantastic!  It is prepared with care and with quality fresh ingredients.  It is plated well and is not only appealing on the eyes but very much so on the stomach.  Every bite was a wave of deliciousness.    The drinks that they make are wonderful as well!  They have a $5 till 5 deal which is amazing and well worth it!  They have a lot of good cocktails and there are several choice beers on tap.    The staff is what really put this place over the top.  They seemed to all work so well in harmony that they really were a well oiled machine!  We had a very short wait but we're found outside and asked for drink orders.  When seated we had a waitress that was for our table but anytime someone passed buy and saw we needed something we were taken care of.  Hands up applause!  Great job!  Keep up the great work!",

I have heard the amazing reviews but just never made the attempt to go until today.  It was a friends birthday and he suggested going here so off we went.  What a CHARMING atmosphere and ever so friendly staff!    There were three of us and we had a slight wait for a table at brunch time but it was very pleasant outside.  We got our table and Hills came over and took our drink order and checked on us and then our waitress Sarah came over to check on us too.  We ordered the $5 Bloody Mary and helped ourselves to the BM condiment bar.  The Bloody Mary was a good size and a bonus was being able to put your own condiments in it!  We ordered our lunch from the very ample menu and I immediately had my eyes on the Cheddar Biscuits with Sausage Gravy!  Being from TX I am a SNOB about biscuits and gravy!  Let me tell you these were TO DIE FOR!  I am sold and will be back over and over!!  My one friend ordered a hamburger and I don't remember what my other friend ordered but all three of us really enjoyed our meal.  Hills came over and checked on us a number of times and I mentioned we were celebrating my friends birthday and the next thing you know she appeared with a ice cream sunday topped with whipped cream and fudge sauce and three spoons!  How totally nice of her!    We enjoyed our brunch and conversation and our special bonding with Sarah and Hills!  We all said we would definitely come back again!  Thank you Windsor, Sarah and Hills for making my friends birthday lunch such a special occasion!",

Same owners as Joy Ride and Postinos so you know it's going to be good. It's also connected to Churn so you can walk right next door for dessert. Everything we had was delicious. The loaded chips, bacon burger, porkwich, and garden chop salad with smoked salmon. The bacon on the burger was insanely good and perfectly cooked. Burger ordered medium rare and came out cooked to perfection. The chop salad isn't a traditional chop salad, it has their own little flare and style to it making it unique and good. Even the side macaroni and cheese was delicious. They should consider making it an entree. The servers were very attentive and made sure water and drinks were never empty. Great ambience inside at the bar and a nice patio to enjoy the weather.",

So we checked out the place while waiting...very cute! I couldn't wait to try the ice cream.  So we got seated and ordered. Since we were sharing the soup of the day (coconut curry chicken), I asked if they could just simply bring an extra bowl. \"Umm sorry, but I can bring an extra spoon.\" Weird. Fine. Maybe they're just out of bowls???  The soup and \"the Falling Out\" salad came out along with the \"Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich.\" \"Here's an extra plate in case\" she says. We already have 2 plates. We didn't need a third. An extra bowl would've been appropriate. The soup had a spicy kick. I thought it was alright. The salad I loved because it was fresh and tasty from the various fruits and goat cheese combination with just enough red wine herb vinegarette. The sandwich was also wonderful with the toasted hazelnut and tender chicken.   My friends enjoyed the oyster po boy sandwich over the lobsta sandwich. 3 different people asked if we (4 people) were done eating. It seemed like they were trying to collect plates as fast as we were eating it. Kinda surprised they didn't ask for our one bowl. Were they low on dishes?? Again, an extra bowl would've been nice. And that's why one less star from me.  I'll be back to try the other entrees!",

He was professional, friendly, apologetic and sounded genuinely concerned about our experience. He extended an invitation to us and we accepted. Our second visit was nothing like the first one. We did see Morgan and she seated us at a table, she was nice and friendly. We were greeted by the server (I wish I could remember her name) she offered drink food & recommendations. My fiance had the New Orleans Style Pork Ribs-Slow roasted baby back ribs with house BBQ sauce, cheddar biscuit and \"surprise\" side, I had the Ahi Tuna Salad & a glass of wine. The food was absolutely delicious! My salad was fresh and the Ahi Tuna had the perfect texture & flavor. My fiance loved the ribs tender & juicy! Everything during our second time visit was perfect! I am excited to visit them again during our weekly date night and trying other items. Thank you Chris for reaching out, we had no intention of going back after our first visit but you helped us changed our mind.",

However, how I've passed up on the bacon burger the last, I don't know, 10 times I've been here, is mind boggling. All I want to eat is that burger. Forever.  Put me on an island with that burger. Turn the ocean into steak sauce. I'll grow onions, age cheddar, have a drift of pigs, a kine of cows. My wife and kid will be okay with it. I promise.",

    "text": "I almost wanted to give this spot five Stars simply for the hand crafted cocktails but that wouldn't be fair so let's just say the cocktails get 5 stars. They are all very good, very unique including a coconut bourbon cocktail that I love AND the best part...wait for it...they are $5 until 5 pm daily. This is one of my fav day drinking spots if that's where my mood lies. I usually order a side of the Mac and cheese which is baked and pretty decent or sweet potato fries. I can comment too much on the w trees here because even though I've been a bunch of times I usually stick to the bar food and sit at the bar. I don't usually stay long as the music isn't always my cup of tea but the bartenders are always cool and it's got that central Phoenix vibe so this place stays on the list. It's a convenient lo and has its own parking lots plus it's across the street from 3 other great bars. It's a must hit.",

Super friendly and always fast service. We enjoy conversation with him. Mike with the bun and tattooed arm is also someone I know and he's always pleasant and fast!  Food is always delicious. We have never had something we didn't like. My favorites are the Reuben, the Windsor style burger, fattoush salad with salmon, hummus for an app, and cheddar fondue for an app. I also love the Number 4 cocktail. They have $5 drinks until 5pm! That also includes beer and wine by the glass.   Very welcoming spot and everyone works very well together to make sure service is fast and efficient. You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Windsor is a charming restaurant. We came in on fourth of July and we were so pleased they were open. It was too hot to sit in their outside patio so we sat inside.   I ordered the Crab Cake BLT. The crab cake itself was delicious. It was the perfect crispiness on the outside and delicious lemony crab goodness on the inside. It reminded me of New Orleans crab cakes. I could eat it by itself. My only complaint about this sandwich was there was too much bread. I ended up taking out the top half of the bread. It came with a salad which was pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the kebabs and he thought it was just okay. I ordered a couple of margaritas and they were great - not too sweet and had the perfect amount of tequila. Our server was excellent and a couple of the other servers kept on checking in on us. I will probably be back to try out their brunch!",

So imagine our surprise when we looked at our bank account and the charge was for over $100! I found the receipt copy, and the actual amount was for $35ish.  Called the restaurant EARLY and asked for the manager. Adam, who answered the phone WAS the manager. I explained what happened and he took the check info, and was totally sympathetic and said he would refund the overcharge. I told him I always round up to the dollar, and always tip 20% so we figured out the total would have been about $43.  Not only was Adam polite, professional, and apologetic - he immediately offered to send a $25 gift certificate for my \"trouble.\" WOW. I used to work in the restaurant industry - and he handled this textbook, old-school, PERFECTLY. (He also gave me his personal cell # in case I needed it.)  And then he followed up with a call 10 minutes later, said he found the transaction, and yes, the server \"fat-fingered\" the tip amount (added a zero) and apologized profusely AGAIN, assuring me that they run \"an honest operation\" and that he would follow up in a staff meeting, stressing that this situation could have been way more dire (if it had overdrawn my account), etc.  And yes, I believe it was an honest mistake. Upward Projects - you should be proud of Adam and congratulate yourselves on hiring well. THIS is what the customer experience SHOULD be. To quote Adam, \"It's not only how we handle our mistake, it's what we do to make it better for you AFTERWARDS.\"  Well done, Adam!",

    "text": "A solid 4 star review on my first visit and I'm eager to come back and check out more items on the menu!  We were seated on the patio which is a large, spacious area. It was chilly last night but the patio was warm and inviting. The only draw-back is that it's...dark. Very dark. Had a hard time reading the menu much less seeing what they placed in front of us but the taste of the food was inviting enough for me to come back in the day-light to get the full effect.  We had the loaded chips to start. They are FANTASTIC. The housemade chips are perfectly crunchy and not greasy or oily at all. The carmelized onion, bacon, blue cheese, were all terrific. I am not sure if the chipotle crema was on there, I didn't taste it and had it been served in a better lit area, I'd know better if it was on there or not.  What I will say is that the loaded chips are a MUST HAVE appetizer because they were phenomenal.   My boy had the crab cake BLT for his main. It was very tasty, served on a roll with perfect fresh veggies. The crab cake was perfectly done...not too moist, not too bready. The french fries that he chose for the side dish were not anything special at all. They were typical shoestring fries that I'm pretty sure were frozen and weren't well seasoned at all. They had salt, but for a place that prides itself with fresh house-made food, I was surprised by the lack of creativity with the fries.  I had the soup and salad combo. The soup was a loaded potato soup which was pretty nice. The broth was nice. Nothing special, but had a nice velvety finish which I like. The bacon was yum but I think it might have been missing cheese or something. It just tasted like something was missing. I wish I could say what. I added pepper but that wasn't it. It was salty from the bacon but not overly so. The salad was the chopped salad which was tasty. The hard boiled egg was way way too salty though. The ranch dressing was nice though and the avocado was fresh and firm.   Our server was thorough but not terribly engaging. It's always been kind of hit or miss with the trendy servers at Postinos so I didn't expect Windsor to be much different. The decor is fun and I loved the wall of cassette tapes. Awesome conversation piece. Bathrooms are very similar to Postinos But unlike it's cousin, Windsor is not yet a 5-star place. It's got potential but it's not quite there. I'll definitely be back because they had a lot of very intriguing menu choices and those loaded chips are worth the price of admission all on its own.   Oh and one other note...like it's cousin, parking at Windsor is also a pain in the ass. Keep this in mind and definitely do the valet. It'll save you a lot of aggravation.",

I tried my husband's Windsor style burger and I thought it was great...and so huge! He only thought it was okay. We had the cheese fondue as a starter and the cheese was to die for! I could have used softer pretzels, but that cheese sauce just made me so happy. I enjoyed the ambiance and entire atmosphere very much. I'm happy :)",

    "text": "My apologies! I thought I wrote this review weeks ago...  Windsor is great! The words \"Best meal we have had in a long time\" came out of my mouth before we were even finished with brunch.   The boy and I met mom and dad at Windsor for brunch a few weeks ago. It was hot out, but we braved the patio, their misting system is awesome! So we were comfortable. Oh before I forget we got a drink at the bar before sitting down and the menu is great! several things for $5, I got a pitcher of some great concoction for $5, it was like 4 drinks in one, needless to say I got myself a little tipsy before noon. Mom and the boy partook in the bloody mary bar they offer, they seemed to like it. Something interesting I saw, they offer a green bloody mary, I think it's spicier than normal. Hmmm?  Once we sat down we decided on a few appetizers, the deviled egg dip and corn dog popers. The dip was fab! I want to figure out how to make this shit at home and eat is on the reg! The popers were good, nothing to write home about, but the fried pickles they snuck in there really made me happy!  We all got something different, me the Eggs Benedict and they were great, eggs were perfectly cooked and there was a heaping of ham on top, I tried my hardest to finish it all. The boy got the Homemade Biscuts and Gravy, they put cheddar cheese in their biscuits, pretty much amazing! and it came with Schriener's sausage double win! Dad got grilled chicken sandwich (which I will be having next time we stop in, so obviously it was good) and he got a side of fried okra and mac'n'cheese. I stool more than a few bites of each because they were just that good. And finally mom had the Pastrami Reuben, mmmmmm yum maybe that is what I will have next time, I cant decide.   The service was great, everything was just awesome! I wish I was able to go right now! I'm hungry!",

I've been only once before for drinks and was seated at exact same table, against the brick wall. I could hardly hear my parents. Between the extra loud music and bad acoustics, we had to yell to have a conversation. :(  mind you I'm a club person and love music, just not while I'm eating and trying to enjoy others company.  I shared the pulled pork sandwich and kale salad, both awesome. But the sandwich was drowning in honey mustard sauce. The service was not the greatest and the waiter was not friendly at all. Only asked my dad how his burger was, which he said was good.  The food and drinks are really great. But not sure I'll be going again soon unless its off peak time and sit inside.",

The menu is fairly small, but I like to think this is because they carefully choose and source their ingredients and prepare well thought-out dishes (I don't know if this is True or not, but it seems likely).  The reason it only gets 3 stars is because I was slightly put off by the trying-too-hard-to-be-hipster vibe, and although the food was good, it wasn't knock-my-socks-off good.  But definitely a solid choice for lunch or happy hour.",

Too wet.  The bun is soaked with juice and \"medium\" is mostly pink and red in the middle.  For a burger, that is undercooked.    This last time our family of 4 went in.  My kids are teenagers.  The waitress was a little surly.  After we sat down a cute young couple got seated in the table next to us.  They got their drinks AND their appetizers before we got our drinks.  They were halfway done through dinner before our meals even got served.  The waitress checked on them 10 times, and would either ignore us or peek over from afar and say \"Are you all good?\"  Joke is on her - the couple calculated the tip to the penny.  We probably would have left a better percentage on a higher tab, if she hadn't played the snob game with us.  I am sorry I am not a 28 year old hipster.  Upward are you trying to drive people like me away?",

Probably 2/3 the size of Postino's menu, which is already a small (side note:  AMAZING) menu.    I was told to go here by everyone in creation because of the owners (meaning, the other places in town they own), and because the food is supposedly amazing.  What was amazing:  The staff.  The restaurant itself.  The location.  What was not amazing:  Parking.  The food.  I don't actually eat burgers, so it was my fault for ordering one.  That said, there are NOT a ton of choices for non-lovers of meat... so I ordered a burger because I sometimes get a hankering for one.  ... Medium well was pretty seriously pink.  The meat... was not my favorite flavor.  The bun... well, I love bread and I didn't love this bun.  My co-diner, however, loved her food.  Why four stars?  1.  The staff really is amazing.  2.  I know that any normal burger eater would have probably devoured my burger.  3.  I do love this location.  Don't not go here on my account - UNLESS you do not love meat.  Then just go to Postino.",

She just happened to be in town so we decided to try out this cool restaurant I'd heard about. The food was great and the ambience was fabulous. The servers are all so nice and even the valet people were super friendly. We were seated out on their patio in the sunshine. Perfect!   What I really want to comment on is how they helped make my Mom's day really special. Our server or one of the managers (I forget who) told me I could go to over the Churn (their sister, an ice cream shop) and pick out whatever I wanted for her! I was thrilled and they even put a candle in the lemon bar and ice cream I'd selected. Needless to say the friendly folks at Windsor and Churn made my mom's birthday lunch a really nice affair and I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I have been here a few times since my previous review for both dinner and breakfast. I will say, I am always satisfied, even though the BF doesn't always love it. When I went for breakfast, I had the matador which was delicious potatoes with chile verde and eggs on a crispy tortilla...it was pretty fantastic. Also, I have had their delicious multi grain salad and their really tasty chicken and corn chowder. Anyway, this place continues to be a satisfying place to eat...no, it's not the best food in town....but I never leave feeling sad that I came.  For your viewing pleasure, my original review: I can pretty much sum this place up in one word.......mmmmmm.  Ok, not really a word, and, of course, I can't really leave a review at one noise, but seriously....mmmmm. I could eat this food all the time...except then I would be super fat, so I won't, but the point is that I could!  I went here on Monday night for my sister in law's birthday/anniversary party. We had a large group of at least ten people. Our waiter, Rodger, was great! He was very attentive, kept our waters full, and even remembered everyone's order correctly without writing it down...pretty impressive stuff.  I ordered the steak frites, but because we were such a large group, I got to try a bunch of menu items. We started with the fondue (soooo good....I wanted to eat it straight with a fork), the loaded chips (?), also very tasty, and the mini corndogs, good, but not as good as the other two. My steak was delicious, it had an herb butter on top and was cooked perfectly. The fries were crispy and perfect. The BF got the burger with church potatoes. The burger was a pretty standard burger....not something I would come here for specifically, but the church potatoes were pretty good. I tried someone else's ribs.....EXCELLENT! The bbq sauce was spicy and sweet...the meat fell off the bone...this is something I would definitely recommend. I think our table had (possibly) one of each entree and everyone raved about the food. I would definitely come back here again.",

I believe it to be a little more hipster than even the Vig... well, maybe just as hipster... but either way its a good change from Scottsdale so make the trip.   I have done three dinners and a brunch here and somehow liked it more than the last time each visit. I have since moved out of Scottsdale, haven't been in the Windsor for a while, and for some reason I can't view their menu, so I won't be getting into too man specifics about the food but you can trust that is excellent.   Brunch: get the doughnut holes as an appetizer, I don't think that was the intention but it works out gloriously. Everything else is awesome, the pancakes are amazing and they have this cream on them that words cannot explain. I personally ordered the sausage and gravy, if you can handle some weight early on in the day, give them a try but make sure someone at the table orders the pancakes and is willing to share a little (good luck with that btw).   Dinner: Come in enough to try just about everything.   If you live in the area this should be you're go-to spot. Period.",

Nice job on the overall design of the restaurant (great patio) and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  The place is obviously popular and was very crowded; parking was difficult.  We were seated in a reasonable amount of time.    Appetizers (Ceviche and the Loaded Chips) were very good.  Kale Caesar with salmon was poor, but all parties agreed that the New Orleans Style Pork Ribs were excellent.  Aside from the Kale Caesar, the only other negatives were that the table was too small for 4 people and the place was very loud.  Will probably not go back for dinner (too crowded and noisy), but will likely try the brunch.",

    "text": "Food is great! Whether I want to be healthy and have the Veggie Stack or pig out the Porkwich and Mac & Cheese, I can always find something I'm in the mood for. Happy hour from 11am to 5pm offers $5 pitchers, wine, and cocktails. And although there is no food on happy hour, all of the appetizers are perfect for sharing over a drink.  I also love brunch on the weekends. I'm not a pancake person, but the pancakes here are amazing! Happy hour also starts at brunch on the weekends so you can have a beer with your pancakes just the way God intended. The only thing I'm not to fond of at brunch is the basic 2 egg breakfast. It's supposed to come with a side of fruit, and I don't consider 2 strawberries a \"side.\"  My only complaints with Windsor are the service. The valet is incredibly slow, and I feel like the waitstaff is never consistent. I've had really great service some nights, and not so great service on others. Still, you can't spell Windsor without \"win.\" I'm so clever.",

They offer so many ingredients that allow you to get creative with your Mary. It was such a cool dinning experience. They also have amaaaaazing $5 cocktails before 5pm and the food was superb. I had the summer salad (trying to watch my figure) and every bite was surprisingly enjoyable. Probably one of the best salads I've ever had! Can't wait to go back again.",

That's  saying a lot for someone who doesn't particularly enjoy omelets that much. I will definitely be back here to try stuff on their normal menu as it looked equally as delicious and the drinks are super reasonably priced.",

They had patio seating and indoor seating.    So, the food was amazing. First we started with Russian Roulettes that we really good.  Then I had the porkwich that I got recommend from my friend (Reese). Wow, that is was by far the best pork sandwich I have ever had.  It had pulled pork; Tender Belly braised ham & smoked bacon layered with gold sauce & crunchy coleslaw on a buttermilk bun. My husband had the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich that is pretty amazing too.  Our friends had the Windsor burger and the bacon burger.    All I can say is, if you have not been to Windsor you are missing out.  You should check it out if you are ever in mid-town Phoenix.",

I've tried the pork sandwich with coleslaw and it was pretty good, I had to be a lady so I had a small salad before the sandwich, which was the Fattoush Salad. Everything was tasty, but I am not going to say OMG it was the best thing I've ever had. The stuff in the menu are things you can easily find somewhere else. The place is nice, low lights, obviously gets a little loud during happy hours, it's a cool little trendy place.   On the personal side, I think the place is cursed!! Why?? Well, I've had 2 first dates there for happy hour and .... sadly...there were first and last. =( Totally heart broken, especially from the cute blue eyed attorney, they were both an awesome catch, but apparently I wasn't =( boooooo... gotta break the pattern though! next first date will be anywhere else but Windsor. =)  Enjoy !!",

We sat outside on their patio which had a very \"comfortable\" feel to it. The lighting and decor just made it feel like you were relaxing on the back porch with some close friends.   Everyone enjoyed their food as we all ordered various items from the menu. My personal favorites were the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Jo's Church Potatoes.   I will definitely be back.

I had the same luck at Postino's the week prior...so weird...anyways....  Ambiance (4*) - Kinda like an English pub inside a 1940's building with, dark booths, brick walls, exposed ceiling.    I was surprise to see a kiddies menu here.  They even have \"Kids Rule\" written on top +1*.  Though there were only 3 main entrees to choose from (grilled ck on stick,  mini corn dog, & twin cheeseburger sliders), the choose of sides were pretty good (veggie of the day, fries, mac&cheese, fruit,  or chips).  Porkwich (4*) w/ chopped Kale Salad (5*) - Lots of things going on in this Porkwich....pulled pork, ham & bacon jammed into btw buttermilk bun.  But it's the chopped kale salad that I chose as my side dish that became the star on my plate. I didn't even know I like kale but  I hope they let me order this as a main dish <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw?select=seKYrjFpy8ABYGQSw_Im5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cTJj...</a>  Drinks - Their hard liquor selection is pretty impressive.  Since I'm a light weight,  the $2.50 shorty Hoegaarden fit me perfectly.  there's also the $5 pitchers for wine, draft or cocktail seems like a great deal if you come before 5 pm. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw?select=vbafXtHUAnGWwtPfeAQPbg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cTJj...</a>  Service (5*)  I did take couple bites of my sister's Pastrami Ruben, which was way too salty.  Other than that, I can't wait to come back again.",

The grilled chicken sandwich is defiantly one of the best you can get.   Customer service has always been one of my favorite things about eating here. Everyone is super friendly.

You can pick up on the sweet flavor of the honey-soy glaze, although the bread is a little overwhelming (I suggest skipping it or going \"open faced\").   My new favorite, though, is the brown bag chicken sandwich ($10). This time, I skipped the bread.  The cold, pulled chicken was moist and robustly flavored. The textures between the tender chicken, the crunch of hazelnuts and the chewy tomato kept it interesting. I went with the fresh vegetable which was broccolini and it was cooked perfectly -- still crunchy!  $5 drinks at Happy Hour include the aptly named \"No. 1\": Tito's Handmade Vodka, Watermelon Agua Fresca, Vanilla-Mint Syrup and Orange Bitters. You can taste every single flavor note in the description. It's a great concoction!  I'm definitely a big fan of Windsor! Looking forward to future visits...",

    "text": "We're big fans of Churn and Federal Pizza.  I also like Postinos, but not as much as the other two.  Windsor has been a bit of a let down.  We did dinner with friends here a few weeks ago, particularly this restaurant for the kids menu and our friends had 3 kids under 10.  Good idea? Yes.  Dinner for 8 was good and affordable.  I purposefully ordered a slightly bland meal due to preparing for a half marathon later that week.  Cocktails are good.  Apps are yummy.  But goodness me, do not come here when it's actually busy.  We had a group of 8 so we were able to get a reservation for dinner.  All of that was fine and we finished with ice cream at Churn.  It was a good night.  Brunch.  NO.  We arrived at 12:15.  We're post church brunchers.  We waited for 45 minutes to finally sit down, order a pitcher of pimms, and there was NO PIMMS in the pimms.  It tasted like lemon juice.  We asked to switch it out for a pitcher of beer (bad idea for this girl who doesn't really tolerate gluten).  Then we ordered.  Loaded chips, frittata for me, matador for husband, donuts to share.  No donuts.  How do you run out of donuts?  Seriously?  He comes back, no matador.  So, we have bad pimms, no donuts, and no matador.  All the food my husband was looking forward to, was a disappointment or unavailable.    My frittata was decent, husband's basic breakfast unappealing (I make a better basic than that) and the fruit cup saddening.  It's summer -- where were the berries!  Neither one of us was in the mood for beer so that didn't life our spirits.    Our lesson: don't go to brunch here.  The most depressing thing was that we tried it because we enjoyed our last experience.  And this experience we did not enjoy.  We know of other places where it may not be as gourmet, but we're in and out quickly and always leave happy.  What makes me really sad is that we probably won't return or recommend this restaurant.  I can't really go back now that I had that experience.  There are other places that haven't let me down, time after time.",

(maybe a close tie with postino)  Amazing vibe and architecture to add***",

    "text": "All three stars go to the food and none to the service. I ordered the (vegetarian) salad I referred to in my previous review and what do they bring me? A caesar salad with salmon on top. They took it back and brought me a non-animal salad. I actually didn't know it was Caesar at first, I just thought wow they really have changed this salad since I last had it. But I started to really wonder where my beets and butternut squash were. I just thought they really gypped me with the toppings. I soon found out that my husband ordered a Caesar salad with salmon but he thought it didn't taste like Caesar and there were a lot more non-Caesar-like things in there, like quinoa and goat cheese and farrow. That's where MY salad went all along! But it had salmon all over it so what could I do at that point but be totally depressed with a weak and boring and very mediocre Caesar salad. So maybe my three stars should be two. But the roasted peppers in oil and salt are just so awesome.   If we had ONE waitress/waiter and not FIVE, it might have gone better for us. And maybe they could like, I don't know, use a notepad to write down the order so they really can get it right?   Also I think the dress code is very slack for the waitstaff. One of them looked like he was trying to be homeless.   They covered up that tree hazard though!!! Enough people must have gotten hurt there. They also have an actual business sign out front now. And a parking lot next door! Still no place to wait but luckily we got seated quickly.",

So to just say it the best item of the night I will return just for the loaded chips.   The next best thing was the service, glasses always full. Someone always there to check on us so attentive.   The country vegetable chop was stellar fresh good flavor and the portions were on point added the grilled chicken and it was a filling meal and couldn't be happier.   The last two things were the Ruben and classic burger. They were decent it's hard to mess it up and they didn't nice seasoning, and quality meat.    I will return here just for the loaded chips.

While the sauce was tasty and the perfect amount of spice, the wings were absolutely disgusting and slimy. Not crispy at all and the skin felt like jelly in my mouth. I unfortunately could not eat them because of the awful texture and taste of the chicken. I had to resort to eating off of my fiance's plate for the rest of the night.  My fiance ordered the grilled chicken sand which, which I thought tasted pretty good. He ordered it with a side of sweet potato fries (my fave) and the meal paired well together. Although the chicken was a little dry, the overall sandwich was good.   There honestly wasn't many things on the menu that appealed to me.

    "text": "We came here last weekend to take advantage of what could possibly be the last pleasant summer day in Phoenix for the season. Naturally, we chose to sit on the patio. It's a nice little space outside with misters everywhere. We got seated in one of the corner booths and decided to get started with a couple of drinks. We ordered the No. 57 and Pitcha of Pimms. The drinks were refreshing without tasting overly sweet, which was a nice break from the monotony of sugary cocktails. The prices were kind of unbelievable. I mean $5 for an entire pitcher of Pimms? Pretty fantastic! They even have pitchers of beer for 5 bucks. What a bargain!   For food, we decided to order The Matador and Southern Style Sausage and Gravy. The former was my order and although the taste was pretty great, the portion size was relatively small for brunch. I tasted the biscuits and gravy and it also did not disappoint. Flavors were on point and so was the service. It was a pleasant experience overall and surprisingly did not break the bank.",

They seem to have forgot about us since the couple of girls next to us got served already with there food. Will not be going back again. Worst experience ever. Unacceptable. I do not recommend coming here. We ended up walking out to eat at Federal next door which I highly recommend going to they have terrific customer service and made us feel like home.",

There was a line outside the door. I wasn't sure if people were just waiting for their names to be called or it was an actual line. Apparently there was no one there to help any of us. This is already a bad first impression for me.   We got seated on the patio. 2nd negative was we got there at 1:10 and missed their brunch menu by ten minutes! Darn it! They need to extend their brunch menu. For drinks I ordered the No. 14. Anything watermelon I just have to try. This drink has Silver Rum, Pressed Watermelon, Habanero-Ginger Syrup, Smoked Chile Rim.There was definitely a kick to it. lol  I ordered the brown bag chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. It was good but not great. I really liked the mac and cheese. My friend got a side of the potatoes which I got to try. I think I liked their sides better than the entrees. lol.   I was a bit disappointed in the customer service here. Our server was not personable, sociable or friendly at all. It was just straight business. What would you like to drink, are you ready to order? Done deal.   I might come back to try their brunch menu next time, but other then that, don't think it was worth the drive for me.",

It shows folks (no matter what they're in the mood for) why Phoenix is getting that foodie-city reputation without breaking the bank.   Windsor is the comfort/bar food option and I will happily get fat off their mac and cheese or that killer crab cake BLT. But they also have good beers, sharp servers, and that dark comfy bar atmosphere (or on a nice day, that airy garden patio vibe) that sometimes hits the spot. Plus you can order Churn delivered to your table. I mean, come on.  Why not five stars? Because when its crowded, IT'S CROWDED. That means everything feels rushed and claustrophobic. So, I can't ever recommend this place on a Friday or Saturday night.   PRO-TIP: Join their e-posse. They email great coupons and freebies.",

The Bloody Mary was way too spicy and horse radish-y. I asked for something toned down. Nothing available- they use a mix. I ordered eggs, bacon and sausage and specifically asked for cracked eggs bc of a food allergy. The sausage was ok....but had a weird flavor. Husband agreed. Bacon was inedible- it had obviously been cooked ahead and was a floppy, greasy cold mess. Eggs were from a carton, not cracked. My entire meal was wrong and bad. I ordered a latte. It was burned, tasted bitter and watery. How could this be?! We had 4 different servers in 45 minutes. All nice folks, but disorganized. My husband had a \"meh\" experience with the chefs dish of the day. I was so excited to bunch here when we arrived. After today, I'm totally surprised at the low level of quality and experience at an Upward restaurant. We've never experienced a fail like this at other Upward Projects restaurants. Totally unexpected. Two stars for friendly staff and nicely decorated, clean interior. We will not return, and will stick to Postino for brunch.",

I appreciate that this restaurant uses lots of kale and quinoa in many of their dishes - they are two of my favorite foods and are highly underused!!  The No. 89 is one of the smoothest cocktails I have ever had and would visit this place just for cocktails.  They also have wine on tap - which is supposed to be more environmentally friendly.

Not a miss on the menu, everything is top notch....mac and cheese or the church potatoes are both great choices for sides.    Did I mention bicycle parking, well riding your bike may be a good idea because Windsor is attached to Churn.  Churn has some of the best ice cream in town and usually some very unique flavor offerings.  In addition they have \"old school\" candy, rice crispy treats, and cookies (in case you want to make an ice cream sandwich).  Windsor is crown jewel from the folks that brought you Postino.",

    "text": "Why, oh why, can't someone put any cool restaurants like the Windsor in North Scottsdale? If it wasn't a 40 minute drive away, I would be living at this place. Seriously. Maybe I should just ask them to let me throw a cot on the patio, get them to promise to leave the misters on during the summer, and I'll pay their rent.   Where to start? The restaurant is housed in an old 1940s (I think) building that they remodeled to - get this - look like a restaurant that has been there since the 1940s. This is not to say that it feels old, just worked in and comfortable like a catchers mitt from little league. I have no idea how they accomplished that feeling while working with new materials. The bar is a horseshoe in the middle of the restaurant with a mahogany top and a \"floating\" box for liquor storage. Although I have not had a chance to sit in the booths, they are black leather and look inviting and cozy.   The patio is unreal. A wall of windows next to the bar collapses and the entire restaurant has an inside-outside vibe. There are plants everywhere and I truly felt like I was hanging out in a friend's backyard - sans pool. Once we saw the patio my date and I immediately decided to wait for a table out there. We stepped aside and servers were immediately asking us if they could get us a drink while we waited (which was very nice) and we each ordered one of their custom cocktails. I had the No.5 which was tequila based and the date ordered one with watermelon and Tito's vodka (I can't remember the number). Both were incredible and helped set the stage for a wonderful night. Our table opened up in about 10 minutes, well within the time quoted.   I ordered the corn dog poppers (I really am just a big child) and the pork sandwich. Both were out of this world good. The poppers were just the right size and I am still craving that mustard. The porkwich was as billed, three different kinds of pork topped with slaw and gold sauce on a fresh bun. I think I overheard someone say that they were thinking about calling it the \"pork threeway\" - too funny. My date ordered the mixed grain salad and let me snag a quick bite before she scarfed it down. I can't remember everything that was in the salad, but the quinoa and zucchini went perfectly with the dressing. That salad was an all star, and I never eat salads. To wash it all down we each had a couple of glasses of the wine on tap (a very cool idea).   Service - the service was great - not overbearing but always available when we needed them. Our server Morgan was very attentive and It looked like they operated on a team service model. It is nice to not have to search for your server if you need help.   In all, this place is amazing. You won't be disappointed.",

All 16 of us loved our meals. We started with some apps to share... the Nachos were outstanding and I'm seriously obsessed with the Deviled Egg dip thing! If you're in the are, this is a must try. Next time I'm out that way I plan to go and sit on the back patio, which is equipped with heat lamps and a fireplace.   Enjoy!!",

It is simply amazing. It is so refreshing in the summer and it tastes like you aren't drinking alcohol. I assure you, there is definitely a good portion of vodka in there!  I also like the Backyard Burger. It is so juicy and the garlic aioli adds so much flavor. The service is awesome. Everyone is so friendly and they genuinely seem to enjoy their job.",

    "text": "Short Version:     Food - Better than good but not quite great  (4-)    Service - Our Waitress was stellar  (5)    Ambiance - Decent although felt somewhat crowded and loud  (Low 3)  All in all, this place deserved better than a 3 star rating but I don't think it is one of the better 4 star places.  Longer Version: We tried this place out on our last trip to Phoenix to add something a little different to the mix of seafood and southwestern places we tend to frequent on our trips to the desert.  We went to Windsor after a day and the Desert Botanical Gardens so wound up getting there shortly after sunset.  It took us a few passes to find the place as signage is small and not very visible.  Parking is in back (where the main door is) but the only wide handicap spots are in front (by the back door).  This little bit a confusion left us entering the back side after multiple trips up and down the street.  Not a great way to start the evening but we were willing to give it a try.  Since it was too hot for us outside, we chose to sit indoors.  The AC was not very efficient.  The floors were basic hard floors and the walls were mostly flat brick.  The overall visual effect was not bad but then again not particularly good either.  However; this made the auditory effect quite LOUD.  All sounds were echoed and amplified making a small place with few actual people quite noisy.  Add to this that there seemed to be too many tables in the small area and the table we were seated at was actually in what should have been a walk way made the overall ambiance a little on the negative side.  Oh did I mention that it was dark?  It was dark too.  A little too dark for our eyes to read the menu.    Well enough on the weaknesses of the place.  Time for some positives (as there were more to rave about than to complain about).  The service was better than great!  Our server was wonderful - fast, efficient, friendly and helpful.  All the things you want in a server.  She greeted us quickly, offered advice on the menu and fixed my problems right away.  The problem with the overall service was that the host staff didn't seem to care about us at all.  We came in from the street side which is there back door and had to wonder through the restaurant to find the host desk.  When we finally did they did not greet us for a while and actually did not offer to seat us or even put us on the wait list. Oh well bad hostesses are trumped by excellent waitress.  Now for the reason to dine out: The Food! We started out with a couple orders of the corn dog popper.  Since Big D does not like hot dogs he refused to try them but the rest of us enjoyed them.  We were glad to have them, but at 7 bucks an order I would not get them again.  For dinner I tried the Crab Cake BLT.  The mustard sauce was way too strong.  I had to send it back and get one without the sauce.  Our waitress was very accommodating in this regard.  Once the sandwich came back with a side of mayo it turned out to be very good.  I would very much like to try it again but the $16 price tag is a bit high for what you actually get.  Big D had a salad and a side of mac and cheese.  He raved about the mac and cheese but almost regretted the getting a salad instead of a more filling entree.  Big D loves his mac and cheese and for him to rave about it means it must be more than excellent and the fact that he didn't offer any tastes to the rest of us really drives that point home.  J and L had the Picnic Kebobs and the Pork Ribs respectively.  Both ladies enjoyed their meals.  The kebobs seemed to be the better choice.  For sides the ladies had Coles Slaw - which they shared and loved as it was sweet and fresh - and the Market Vegetable - which they say was a mistake as there weren't enough for the meal.  I had the fries which were crisp delicious and plentiful.   Overall, the food is better than good but not quite great.  For most items the price is a few bucks over reasonable, entree portions are good and the sides were decent.  We all agreed that the food was too good to be called a 3 but was not equal to other 4 stars.  This place was too good to be rated with only 3 stars but 4 stars almost seemed to be generous.  It was more like 3 and 5/8ths.",

The mac and cheese was also tasty and I loved the crispy topping. We also got a side of veg which was spinach and I wish we had ordered two. It was yummy. Their winter ale on tap (forget the exact name) was surprisingly good.   This place is fantastic...except for one thing. It's a teensy bit over priced. Just a buck or two on each item overpriced. I'm going to need to find the email/text/yelp deals in order to return as much as I might like...or I could just take up extreme couponing so I can go there every week.",

I went for the second time recently and have to give this place a stellar review. The menu is innovative and fresh! The mixed drinks are killer and the wine on tap was an extremely pleasant surprise. Plus, you can't beat their happy hour seven days a week!    I have had the crab cake BLT and the halibut sandwich, which were both out of this world! Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I can't wait to go back and try all the others.  The servers were great and knowledgeable about their menu which is always a big plus! As a parent, I love that this place is a perfect day/night out spot for a date or hanging with friends but also a family oriented neighborhood joint where I can bring my kiddo along! Love that Churn is right next door to get some yummy dessert after an incredible meal!  The design is spot on for this area! Great job!",

Windsor is a lot like Postino but for liquor and beer but of course with much more depth to the menu. The atmosphere is similar to that of Postino with exposed brick, dim lighting, and a swanky yet casual feel not to mention their wall of cassette tapes, very cool.",

Imagine a really cool gastro pub with high quality (and deliciously savory) food items, surrounded in plaid patterns, retro-chic (male heavy) influenced art design, and a kick-ass patio area. The bar inside offers just about anything your alcoholic heart might desire- with a killer happy hour of $5 beer pitchers (great selection of brews to boot), glasses of wine from the tap (yes I said tapped wine but it's really good stuff), and other delicacies. The staff is extremely friendly- they know when to check in and when to just let your group hang out and enjoy the Windsor. If you're not hung up on meat, please try the burger Windsor style- it doesn't get any better for the $11 price- and includes one of their indulgent sides (mac n cheese for the win). Expect a crowd because the establishment is top notch- the owners know a thing or two about creating an \"experience\" as they also manage the Postino chain (one of the 3 locations is basically across the street from Windsor). If you're in the mood for a really incredible place to hang out, have a few drinks, indulge in some delicious food, and really just enjoy a laid back dining experience then the Windsor should be at the top of your \"must try\" list. Afterwards, walk next door to Churn and order up some homemade ice cream or purchase a few throwback candy items. It's all a part of the experience anyway, right? Enjoy!",

    "text": "Visited Windsor for the second and last time. We were seated pretty quickly even though it was a busy Friday evening. The young lady at the front door was very friendly and nice, but that is where the pleasantries end. The music was so loud; my party of three couldn't hear each other talking very loudly. The waiters couldn't hear each other and they were yelling. What is it with all the super loud music at restaurants these days? I have decided to start a one-woman campaign to end crazy loud music in restaurants. No wonder the art of conversation has been lost. People can't hear each other over the loud music in restaurants. Music should be the background, not the foreground. Next, our waiter must have been angry that he stayed out in the sun too long earlier in the day. He looked sunburned. He was so angry. First throwing plates on the table and then throwing water across the table and not wiping it up or acknowledging he toss everything at us. I get a refill of water and this time he throws ice and water across the table. Never wipes any of it up. He had the worst attitude of any waiter I have ever seen. The food is ok, but doesn't taste too good when you get nasty service.",

Tatted up and all CenPho, she was outstanding.  Not only exceptionally nice to us, but incredibly sweet to our 3YO daughter.  Even while busily trying to get people seated, she made time to to bring a small ice water outside to Charlie. While waiting for our table (about 20 min), she offered to get us some drinks as there were only a few minutes left in Happy Hour.  And then every single employee, server manager, whoever, smiled and said Hi on their way by.  Busy as hell, and still cool. Now for the food, we got some sliders for Charlie, and Sarah and I both had the Crab Cake BLT.  We ate everything.  Happily.  Not \"the best thing I ever ate\", but still wonderful.  Our super-hostess came by and brought Charlie a treat from Churn next door as a thank you for being such a good girl the whole time.  Again, so thoughtful. Bottom line is that we are thrilled to have more and more awesome restaurants in our 'hood.  We will be back again and again, and show our friends.",

The service was fantastic which is a big factor for me in my star rating. We were only there for a bite but it's definitely the kind of place I could hang out for a few drinks. It looks like they have some pretty reasonable drink specials before 5:30 on weekdays. Also attached is a candy/ice-cream shop so guys, if you're looking for a great date spot, Windsor will impress...guaranteed.",

We decided to get the cheese fondue.  The pretzel bread was delicious and the apples were crisp and juicy Ashley enjoyed the sausage so I will take her word for it.  I got the Kale Caesar salad with the butternut squash bisque.  The soup warmed me to the bone and was perfectly smooth and delicious.  The salad was full of flavor, minus the avacodo stupid allergies, which was interesting since it was all greens with the cheesy biscuit croutons.  Ashley got the porkwich minus the bacon, yes she is weird, and was only able to eat about half of it.  She got Jo's Church Potatoes as her side and they were fantastic.   The menu doesn't have a huge selection but it looks like they want quality not quantity.  My glass was empty for large periods of time so that is why there are only 4 stars.  All in all I think I will have to go back again.",

With a few exceptions.  Our server felt it required to resight the establishments policy in regard to split checks in a very rude and corrective manner.  In short,  we where treated like children.  One statement she made rings in my ears...\" OK, Well thats not the way we roll,  we dont do that.  I'll make an exception for this one gut...but thats it.!\"  \" Is there anyone else ?\"  As she was ovbviousley very disturbed and put out!  I sat there and was shocked at her tone and delivery.  Then a few others at my table requested separate checks because they were leaving early.  I had just arrived and everyone had just been served.   I saw no reason not to get a separate check.  She then became very upset and said,  \"OK,  we dont roll this way.  In the future we cant do this, I'm just saying.  OK?  She was tototally out of line.  From there it was a disaster....DOWN HILL.  When accepting large parties and establishment needs to state policy in writing or verbally on the phone or at the beginning of presentation.  I am willing to give WINDSOR  another try because another server saved the day in the end...but it was very embarrasing for all involved.   And yes that finally split the check after we were scollded.  Thanks",

Kammie K was my lunch partner. When I got there, she had a bowl of pistachios in front of her. In. The. Shell. I love that! Good food always takes a little work, right? As we munched on the nuts (hahaha I am a nut muncher!) I saw something on the menu I'd been wanting to try for a couple months: kale chips. The chips came with a ranch dipping sauce, but I only tried a little of it. They were perfect on their own! Garlic hunks and sea salt peppered each leaf perfectly. I can't wait to learn how to make them at home! I also had bite-sized corn dogs. They were pretty good & came with a side of mustard, but some of the batter didn't cook all the way on a couple of the pieces. The patio here is awesome. The misters really keep the temperature down, though I will have to really judge that in July.   They have the BEST soundtrack playing, too. It's a mix of awesome 80s music. Oh, and their wall is covered in cassette tapes. Some of them are mixed tapes. FTW!!! (Bring $5 for the valet. There is street parking, but it's hard to come by.)",

Windsor has GOT to do SOMETHING about their fly problem. I have experienced this issue before here but today was by far the worst ever. We could hardly eat our food and found it very difficult to even carry on a conversation with all the flies attacking our table - and we were sitting INSIDE. Instead of ordering another drink we had to quickly finish our food and get the heck outta there. It was very very gross.  That being said - Windsor has been a staple for us for several years. We usually love the atmosphere, food, drink specials AND service.   Even today when we asked \"What's up with the flies today?\" Our server was very gracious and said it's something we've been dealing with because the doors are left open for brunch - and during the summers this leads to flies.   Unfortunately not even great service can overcome this issue. This has gotten SO BAD we WILL NOT be back to eat here during the summer months...whick makes me sad because I crave it often. Something has to be done. This is not ok. Oh and on that same note - maybe turnong up the AC would help? It was very toasty in there.",

My Windsor neighbor was super sweet allowing me to sit next to her before her wify showed. I ordered up a small pitcher of Stella Artois $5., a 75 point, 5.00% ABV,  very light golden brew. Crisp, sweet pale malts aroma and finishes up a bit dry. It's refreshing and easy to drink.  This will be my first shot at a Crab Benedict since La Jolla. It's going to be a tough act to follow here in the desert. It was indeed rich and creamy, bright with lemon, this classic brunch dish was traditional with no twists except the crab are crabcakes and I believe straight up cooked crab on the bread is better.$14.50.  Windsor is one of my favorite dinner houses. Even took a few pics of my rock bands from the past that hang in the cassette hall of flame.",

I had just missed the $5 everyday pitchers but worth it at regular 6 dollar price. Yaayo! Also the wings were delicious.. A spicy yet sweet flavor. I loved how saucy they were and the crushed pepper I could see and taste. I would almost call it a spicy mole flavor. At the end another bartender noticed I was done and anticipated my sticky fingers offering me a warm steamed towel to wipe it off. Wow that's some service. It has a very interesting menu. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Dear foodies,  I recently visited Windsor for the first time with a guy friend who is also a big foodie. He and I were really excited thinking that their happy hour would end at least by 6 pm like most places, but it ends Very early at 5 pm. That is something that does not make sense to me especially since most people's work days do not end until 5 pm.   Moving on...  We were seated on the patio, which at first was awesome and beautiful and comfortable since they had the misters on. Then as the sun started to disappear, the mosquitos started to appear. I was badly eaten up around my ankles and on the top of my feet by the mosquitos on the patio. My guy friend had to request that they bring over one of the citronella candles; that helped a little but it was already too late.  Now the food...  The beers that they have on tap were delicious and I truly enjoyed them. I had the Windsor Style Backyard burger without the bun, wrapped in lettuce. It was perfectly prepared and the toppings complimented the flavor of the burger. I had their Mac-Cheese as a side and was pleasantly surprised. When I think of Mac-n-Cheese, I think of only getting this dish as soul food restaurants normally when I am back East or down south, but they actually did a very good job with the flavors. :)  My friend ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, which on the other hand was not as culinary pleasing as my dish. The salad lacked flavor, dressing, and excitement. The Ahi tuna was prepared very well, but the salad portion lacked on various levels. He told one of the servers about his lack of culinary orgasms with the salad and the manager Lisa came out and talked to us and also removed it from our bill. We were not expecting that, but it was a pleasant surprise and I appreciate a customer service driven and involved establishment. Lisa was adorable, professional, and a great listener.   With that, I will be back. I am overall impressed with their establishment and the service.  Next time I will sit inside and arrive prior to 5 pm to enjoy their happy hour as well.",

There were 9 of us and I have not seen most of these people for a while and was really looking forward to talking and catching up.  There was no talking, it was only screaming to the person next to you. I have no idea if others enjoyed their meal because I would not have been able to hear their answer if I asked.  There was nothing unusual or wonderful about my Falling Out salad. It was plain and I have made plenty of better salads at home.  This restaurant has a lot going for it particularly now that the parking issue has been resolved. The outside seating is very nice and the weather was perfect.  I asked THREE times for the music to be turned down. The last time I was told that the problem is, if they turn down our speakers, they would have to turn down the entire restaurant's speakers. And the problem with doing that was.....??? My only guess is, these young folks must have already lost much of their hearing if they think having music on so loud that you can't even talk to those sitting close to you is OK. Or perhaps others enjoy sitting and texting the person next to them.  If the music had been MUCH lower, the event would have been a delight regardless of what the food was like.   I will say, the dessert from Churn was fabulous!!  I really had high expectations as this restaurant is right around the corner from my home and I could easily walk, but why bother????",

My favorite part is the cassette tape lined wall leading into the hall to Churn and the shared unisex bathrooms.  This place is very much a come as you are yet slightly fancy mix of fine dining flare and gastro pub in terms of decor and menu.  We ordered the Windsor Burger, Roulette Peppers and the Kale Caesar.  The burger was delicious (medium rare) and one of the best I've had. It was moist and flavorful; very well done on a soft pretzel style bun.  The sweet potato fries were okay; a bit on the soggy side and I would have preferred some more salt.  The salad was excellent and was not over dressed. The croutons were cheesy and they added avocado and celery which was unique and added something special. The only thing I'd do differently is to slice the celery thinner as it was awkward to get a small enough bite with the other ingredients.   The peppers were also fantastic and were done in some lemon juice olive oil and the right amount of salt.  I'm excited to come back for brunch!",

And little touches of pizazz like the cassette tape wall and the boom box wall paper in the bathroom.   The patio is comfy at night or in the cooler months, and probably better for a larger group.    Yes, yes, I'm getting to the food. I have been here with friends, with a dude, with my kid, by myself, cuz that is how I roll, and I have tried a lot of the menu. Burger=BOMB. pork was amazing, mac n cheese to die for, dang! I can't remember what else I've eaten here but I have yet to have a bad experience. Let me know what you think when you go!",

The quality of the food is amazing, especially for the price! It's a tremendous value. The management team, let by GM Adam is professional and makes sure each guest experience is positive. We love Windsor and always look forward to spending a lazy Sunday afternoon inside when hot and outside the rest of the year. This is also THE BEST kid's menu in town. For $5, our son gets home cooked and delicious food that comes with a drink and a little bit of fruit and veggies. A MUST visit if you're in town.",

Their Bloody Mary bar is the best with a great variety to mix in (and who really needs to eat after all of those olives!)  If you go for brunch, it is a MUST to experience their zucchini bread.  My friends tried mine yesterday, and they ended up stealing the whole thing from me!  HA!  And I also decided not to get the rest of the brunch yesterday and actually get a burger.  I got the Windsor style, and I have to say it was one of the best burgers I ever had!  I was totally impressed!

I was drinking iced tea and not only did they refill it every time I got to the half way mark, they even brought me extra ice for the table in case I wanted to add more!    The only downside, when we were there they had a large party (I'd say probably around 15-20 people) and we were seated near them.  Because of this it was pretty loud and at times hard to hear the people we were with.  That being said, I think if there wasn't such a large party it would have been average noise levels, so I may update my rating after I go back..... and with the food they serve I will be going back!!!",

She was friendly, patient, and took good care of us.  - The patio is awesome!  - the specialty drinks are delicious.  Not too sweet, and unique.  The menu is limited, which can be both a good or bad thing.  Frankly, I prefer a menu that isn't pages and pages long.  It makes me wonder about the freshness about the food when there are 500 dishes.  I tried the potato chips with blue cheese.  They were a-amazing!  My only suggestion was to be sure to split these with at least two other people.    The Not-So-Good: I didn't care for the skewers.  I found the spices to be bitter, and the spicy chili side bland.  I also found the beef to be especially tough and gristly.    Overall, I would go back with friends, and possibly bring a dog or two, have some tasty drinks, and split some chips.  Another good social restaurant from the people that brought you postino.",

Neat atmosphere both inside and outside, and friendly staff. Their food is quality and fresh and worth the price you pay. I'm always beyond satisfied with their vegetarian options. My go to menu options are the Grain salad or the Berkeley veggie burger. My meat lover friends rave about the burgers and crab cake BLT. For brunch they always offer a chef omelette special and my friends are a fan of their biscuits and gravy.

Otherwise, the staff is pretty accommodating.   Food:  Not a fan. I've been three times and tried a different dish each time. They try to put a spin on everything that would be considered a \"classic\" dish, but they fall short. For example, their mac-n-cheese, they add in all these rich cheeses, but douse the top with too much crunchiness. Most of their dishes that I've sampled have something that is just off the mark just like the mac-n-cheese.  Drinks:  Creative. They have unique cocktails. Their cocktails are also strong, you WILL taste the alcoholic kick in each drink. I'm a fan of the bloody mary, but the bloody mary bar is over-hyped. It's essentially a little nook in the bar where you can add more Tabasco or various other ingredients. A nice concept that is not practical if the place gets busy (this bloody mary \"bar\" is situated behind an 8 person table so if its busy you'll have a tough time getting to it).  This place is over-hyped, but I guess all the trendy \"hipsters\" need somewhere to go. I'd rather spend money at one of the nearby establishments (Postinos or St. Francis).",

They made the switch with the regular toppings with no problem.  The server even complimented my selection.  Well!  Tip of my hat to you too little lady!  The egg whites were undercooked a bit on the inside but I find this to be a common issue with this dish.  I just scraped them to the side with my knife and dug in - very delicious.  The coffee was good.  The cheesy hash browns I stole off my husbands plate were life changing.    One last note on parking.

In crunching for time instead of calling triple A I decided to walk back in an ask for help from one of the worker. The person was beyond helpful he had offered to figure a way to help me. After getting my car started by a couple of customer who help jump start my car the worker came back out with a card to thank the couple for helping me with my car. Now to me this was way above and beyond service. I later called to find out that the worker name is Larry. Thank you Windsor for employing not just good severs but also great management team as well. I will continue to bring my hungry self to your location not just for food but definitely now for the great caring from your staff. Thank you!",

    "text": "After visiting Postinos quite a few times, I had really high expectations of this place. The food and service at Postinos is fantastic.  ...then there's Windsor. My wife and I ate here for dinner. We had the Corn Dog Poppers appetizer. The dough was very dry and would fall off from around the hot dog (sliced as thinly as two quarters stacked on top of each other). They did not look burned, but had a strong burnt taste.  I had the Porkwich sandwich. The BBQ sauce I was not a fan of myself, and the pork was dry. The coleslaw on the sandwich overpowered the pork and sauce.  My wife had the Backyard Burger which was just \"OK\".   As for the service, it was \"meh\". Not attentive, definitely do not seem to really care. He took our appetizer order, then our entree order, after that we had to waive someone down just to get my wife some water.  The service was below average, the food was average. Overall the price does not justify the quality or the service. I will personally never come back to Windsor. I truly do not see what the fuss is about. It's dark, it's loud, and the service is poor.  Also, the valet drivers need to learn how to drive, and pay attention when they are exiting the parking lot near the residential street. Often times as I drive through there they pull out of the parking like fast and don't appear to have even looked, otherwise they would have seen my coming about 20 feet from the driveway!  As a side note, the owners of Windsor opened up a pizza place that is pretty good!  A for Postinos A for their pizza place D- for Windsor",

Although they have a bar and a trendy ambiance, they do a great job serving kids and families. We were having a daddy/daughter night out, and it was so nice to see a kids menu that offers more than mac & cheese and chicken tenders. My daughter got a pulled pork slider and fried okra. It was delicious and came out on a little tray with separate compartments. We had about three servers checking in with us regularly and they were all really nice and very attentive to my daughter. It's great to have places like this in our neighborhood. This will be a regular spot for my family. Great job Windsor team!",

It makes you want to puke!! And in addition, the urine from the urinal has splashed onto the glass case that stores the toilet paper. There are NO seat covers so you end up wiping down the toilet seat yourself, gross!!!    And after I spoke with the Manager , Leslie, she mentioned to me that the other restroom has no urinal....so make that one the Women's bathroom and save women from the view of the urinal and the urine on the floor and wiping down the toilet seat. In addition, Seat covers would be a plus for sure!!!!!  I was really enjoying the ambiance, food, drinks and that good ol local feeling till I saw the urinal collection in such a nice neighborhood hot spot.  Leslie....you really need to clean those bathrooms more ofter before a health code violation comes your way, NO JOKE!!!  Clean up your act!!!!  I will not be returning back, bummer.

    "text": "I can't say enough good about Windsor.  We went early on a Saturday evening (5:30 PM).  We were greeted within a couple of minutes of walking to the entrance, which is behind the building which faces Central Avenue.  Within a minute or two of being seated, our server came by to ask us for a drink order and someone else came by to deliver water.  As others have noted, service is excellent and team-based.  No less than 4 folks came to help us during dinner.  As if the service weren't enough, the food was really exceptional.  I'd call it elevated bar food.  We shared the \"Russian Roulette\" - shishito peppers sauteed in olive oil and lemon juice - and the tuna tartare.  Neither my wife nor I could decide which we liked batter, but there wasn't a crumb left on either plate when they were cleared away.  For dinner, I had the short rib, which was flavorful and fork tender.  My wife had the Ahi Tuna salad, which we agreed may have had the best prepared seared tuna we had ever had.  The food menu is complemented by a moderately small, but outstanding drink list, including wines by the glass and bottle (including some, like Bedrock Old Vine Zinfandel, which is produced in pretty small amounts!), beers on draught and bottle (I had a Milk Stout that was awesome), excellent call liquors (I recognized some pretty good single malt scotches) and creative mixed drinks.  If I had any complaint it's that the restaurant is very loud.  Note that this doesn't diminish my view of the restaurant - it is exactly what it advertises itself to be.  We were warned that Friday and Saturday nights after 6 PM get crazy - up to an hour wait - but we'll definitely be back.  This is one restaurant that I think may actually be worth that kind of wait!",

If I lived next door, I'd be drunk all the time. I'm partial to the No. 6, which is comprised of gin, housemade strawberry syrup, strega, and-wait for iiiiit-apple cider vinegar. Yeah. You heard that right. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely for me. It's one of the best drinks I've ever had.   The service is excellent. The atmosphere is wonderful. The fact that I can get amazing coffee ice cream and homemade salted caramels next door helps. I always feel fancy having my car valet parked. I always feel less fancy when I realize it's full of empty coffee cups and granola bar wrappers. Don't forget to bring cash to tip the valet folks!",

They seem to work as a team to make sure everything is perfect. I can't think of another establishment that operates under this philosophy.

Oh I forgot, my ahi salad had no flavor and my husbands crab cake sandwich apparently received the entire salt shaker. Tried the egg salad dip. I can live the rest of my life without this again. Bland egg salad topped with super salty bacon and blue cheese. Never again. Btw, we paid 14 dollars for the salty sandwich and 16 dollars for the salad a two year old could have put  together. This of course would have been a three star review if maybe the server didn't feel as to put us last on his list. We waited after finishing our dinner, obviously done, for at least fifteen minutes before he removed the plates and we had the opportunity to ask for the check. Something on our faces must have clued him in not to ask any questions, just told us we could go next door if interested in dessert. I am thinking the cocktails must be good, we do not drink,  but think it is definitely important to drink here.",

Our 3 person party's visit was on a busy Saturday night but fortunately we only had a short 5 minute wait.   After being seated at a corner booth, we started our meal with their Cheddar Fondue, $11. It featured pulled pork, apple slices, caraway bread, sausage and a white cheddar for dipping, yes it was a good as it sounds. For our main dishes we ordered the Porkwitch $12, pulled pork ham & smoked bacon with coleslaw, A country Vegetable Chop Salad $9, with greens, Kale, brussel sprouts, corn, snap peas with a ranch dressing and a Banh Mi Halibut Sandwich $13, with grilled halibut with honey soy glaze. All were tasty but the Bahn Mi Sandwich was the best of the three. It has the perfect spiciness and crunch from carrot and cucumber.   If you enjoy comfort food, you will like this place, and don't miss their sweet shop connected to the restaurant that features house made ice cream.",

Austin (son) loves the Porkwich, while Deane and I travel back and forth between the burgers, fish sandwich and various salads. Sunday brunch here is not to be missed! Also, the bar offers a variety of interesting, original drinks. Best yet, curve right around the corner in the same establishment and you can get freshly made ice cream at Churn (in the same building). GREAT place; come here all the time and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates good food, interesting atmosphere and friendly people.",

    "text": "I went to Windsor w/ a group from work at lunch time.  We were greeted promptly and seated outside on their shady patio.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and took our drink order.  He also answered our menu questions and gave his opinion on a couple of dishes.  The food came out quickly and hot.  All I can say is \"AMAZING\".  I had the halibut sandwich with mac n' cheese as the side.  Very good taste to the halibut w/ a little kick that was unexpected, but loved.  The only suggestion I can give for this sandwich is to lighten up on the greens and please, please, please, take the stems off of the cilantro!  I am in love w/ the taste of cilantro but the texture of the stems was off putting.  Overall, this was a great restaurant w/ wonderful atmosphere.  Service was good and we left satisfied!  The 4 stars is just b/c the talented chef should consider reducing the amount of greens on the halibut sandwich and make sure to take the stems off the cilantro.  Well done!  Can't wait to go back when I can indulge in some adult beverages!",

I don't think there's is much gastro or pub deserving qualities. The food is eh. We had the nachos (there listed under a fancier name on the menu) and those were actually very good. The salmon entree I got with the kale salad... not so much. Salmon was overcooked and the kale salad was well, a salad- not deserving of the rave reviews our server gave it. My comrade got the white fish banh mih... Now I am a HUGE fan of Vietnamese food and even futile fusion attempts by 'American' restaurants... Don't call it a banh mih if you're not going to serve it on a demi-french baguette. It was served on the same bun they serve their burgers on... So what you end up getting is a very SOFT sandwich. eh.  The drinks are good though. I would go for happy hour (even though it ends early- 5pm). $9 cocktail for $5 is a steal and they do execute that well.",

    "text": "Obsessed.  Stopped in for lunch for the first time last weekend and I've been thinking about it (and talking about it to anyone who will listen) all week. I'm already a regular at Postino, so I had high hopes and Windsor definitely lived up to, if not exceeded, my expectations.  The restaurant is charming from the minute you walk in...I loved the cool bar surrounded by plaid bar stools, and the nice big booths.  Make sure to take a trip to the bathroom and check out the awesome wall o' cassette tapes - it's a nice touch.  I asked my server about a few different wines and not only was he knowledgeable, but he brought me over pours of three different whites to try.  That's some pretty awesome service.  I went with his suggestion, a Riesling, which was bright and nice for the summer, and wasn't overly sweet like many Rieslings. Plus you gotta love the $5 price tag.  I also followed his suggestion for my lunch and got the halibut sandwich with the kale salad on the side.  The kale salad was light, fresh and interesting, but ohmigod the SANDWICH. I couldn't stop eating it.  Usually I wouldn't be able to finish a big ol' sandwich for lunch but I was seriously in love with this one.  The fish was delicious and flaky, the bun perfectly toasted, the vegetables a nice crisp addition, and there was some awesome creamy sauce with a bit of a kick.   I will definitely be back....there are at least five other items on their menu that I can't wait to try.  The Postino folks have another winner.  Wasn't too busy when I went there, but give it a few months to catch on and I'm sure it'll be mobbed.  Has an adorable outdoor patio that will be beautiful when the weather cools down.   I love you, Windsor!",

Porkwich - decadant comfort food, and never had a sandwich that I find myself daydreaming about frequently.  Bahn Mi - wow.  Brown Bag Chicken - glad the server told us it was cold, huge flavors, so tasty.  Crab cake sammy - best crab cakes since leaving the east coast.  Can't decide which side is my favorite - okra, mac & cheese, church potatoes....  Deviled egg dip and kettle chips, loaded chips, kabobs - even the apps make me want to go back, now!  Service is awesome - have never seen service in a pooled tips environment be so awesome.  Everyone works together to enusure you are well taken care of, start to finish.  When someone comes to your table mid-way through the meal and knows what you're drinking when all that's there is an empty glass, then knows exactly how to split a check (one of us was on an expense report) without asking how to split it - all I think is 'How do they train this?'  All that and each server still gives personal attention / interaction that makes you want to come back again and again.  Truly conflicted in writing a review - I want this to be 'our little secret' so we don't get locked out by the crowds!  But discovering a great happy hour and super patio - we're happy going early and hanging for a while!  Besides, the timing works perfectly for wrapping up with ice cream from Churn (peanut butter ice cream - who told them that's my secret obsession?) before heading home relaxed, sated and STILL talking about a great meal and wonderful experience....",

We were seated in a big booth with plenty of room.  THE FOOD: We ordered the cheese fondue appetizer. The bread and apples were great in it, but we were a bit confused by the pulled pork on the side. Should we stir it in? We ended up putting it on top of the bread after being dipped in the cheese.  I had the Windsor burger. I have read reviews treating it like it was the second coming. I wouldn't go that far, but it was a good burger. Juicy and obviously hand formed, with smoky carmelized onions and the rest of the fixins. The fries were suprisngly tasty, not just a throw-away side dish.  Others at the table had the pastrami sandwich which was proclaimed \"interesting\", but very tasty.  THE SERVICE: Adequate. Not great, not bad.   THE DECOR: The wall of cassettes is amazing. Look at my pic, that is my favorite. I have become obsessed with what I think might be on that mixed tape.  Will I go back? Sure. But I'm going to wait for the frenzy to die down a bit.",

It connects to Churn which is an ice cream shop next door. That place is cool too.   My wife and I ordered the Cheddar Fondue appetizer. That was amazing. You got to have that.

Very flavorful.   I got the New Orleans Style Pork Ribs. It was to die for. The fries that came with it were good. The cheddar biscuit was just okay though.   We went on a night that wasn't very busy, but we've seen this place packed before on Friday and Saturday nights. The service was good too. It's a little pricey, but it's good for a special occasion!

Vietnamese Coffee, toasted coconut... these are just two of the flavors that you can get. and the environment at this place makes me feel like smalls from sandlot stepping back into a old school candy shop.  now back to the set up of our cinematic trek through Windsor.   opening credits.... Valet service and a back entrance thought the court yard/patio give the romantic feel of a Minnie driver movie, but at the same time the dim lighting and the fact that you are sneaking in around the back makes you feel like you could be meeting up with The Godfather himself. I am captured before I even hear the lead actor talk.  enter host.... a little hard to tell who is the \"good guys\" aka working staff wanting to seat you and get you a beer from the central bar, and \"bad guys\" aka other guests who just want to take your seats. Like John Rambo I dominated the field and got a great seat on the patio.   action picks up... appetizers, I am a sucker for blue cheese and caramelized onions, and just like Jeff Daniels and Jim Carey in dumb and dumber the \"loaded potato chips\" were an instant hit!!! If that dish was the dumb and dumber of Jim Carey's potato chip appetizer career, then the deviled egg dip is his Ace Ventura... I could eat both every week and never get tired of them.   climax.... pork-which, crab cake BLT, brown bag chicken sand which, burger.... think of these as such movie star greats as, Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Daniel Day Lewis.... now don't get too attached to the love of the charecters/entres when they hit your table. just as in any good movie the hero (your meal) will meet their demise in the end and you will leave the restaurant just as you would leave the theater, in awe of what just happened. \"how did I just consume an entire Denzel Washington!?\"  this place is great a True academy award winner in my books. I am back at least once a month !!!",

    "text": "I ordered the New Orleans ribs which were reasonably priced and yummy but not memorable. My friend ordered the crab cake BLT and HOLY GOD was it good! It was probably the best sandwich I ever tried. But when applying the laws of bacon of course it's going to be awesome (Bacon + anything = awesome). In this case, bacon + (crab cakes and baguette) = bestsandwichever!   The service was mixed. Our server wasn't anything special and was absent a few times when we needed her. My companion noticed her boyfriend sitting in her section (or at least what appeared to be her bf) who seemed to be taking up a considerable amount of her attention. But Windsor is well staffed. They have food and drink runners helping out the servers so nothing is sitting out for long. Also, without telling anyone, one of the employees brought out an umbrella to shield our table from the sun. I was pretty impressed with their attention to detail.   My only real complaint is about the loud table of bros sitting by us. I understand that there's nothing the staff can really do about that. I just don't get why you would come to a restaurant to only drink with 10 of your frat bros. Go to the Mill Ave for that.   The parking is what it is. I think Phoenicians tend to overreact about valets and little parking lots because we are spoiled with lots that take up a city block. If you go to any urbanized city parking is always set up like this; just deal with it folks.   Overall this place is pretty good and gets 4/5 stars. They certainly have the tools and capability to be a 5 star restaurant (by Yelp standards anyway). We'll see how things go next time!",

My husband and I LOVE the deviled egg dip appetizer... I dream about that stuff! My favorite sandwich is the brown bag chicken, it's a perfect blend of deliciousness that is too much to describe, but seriously, try it! My hubby usually gets the fish sandwich. Both of us get Jo's Church Potatoes as our side (I never said I eat healthy here...).   I've also had brunch here a few times and have loved it. The crab cakes Benedict was perfect and the bloody mary was a great one.   Unless you're lucky enough to find an open spot in the handful they have, expect to valet. It's free but make sure you tip the guys, they're pretty quick!   I'd also like to mention that a gentleman who I'm assuming is a manager that is always running around is one of the BEST managers I've ever seen in a busy restaurant. He's hilarious and always two steps ahead of you in picking up plates, refreshing drinks or offering his advice on what you should eat.",

I ended up getting the Simple Life ( Two eggs any style with an MJ English muffin, Tender Belly bacon, & seasonal fruit), which you can't really go wrong with eggs and bacon. But those Corn dog poppers, though. OMG, best thing-EVA, crunchy outside, salty inside (that's the hot dog part) and with these fried dill and sweet pickles on the side, I was done, not because I love hot dogs, I mean, I'm an adult, so yea, but more so because those damn fried pickles were a blessing to my soul.

The decor was decent, very city like, with exposed brick, and a cassette tape wall near the bathrooms. The place was pretty packed, with us arriving at around 730. We were greeted promptly, and seated in the same manner. Thought that we were off to a good start. For a starter we ordered the Corn Dog Poppers, which were presented in a bowl, with fried pickle chips and spears, and a side of mustard. So far so good, they were pretty fun to eat really. I ordered the New Orleans style ribs, with coleslaw,  while my husband ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger (Med. Rare) and a side of mac and cheese. We also ordered ice tea to drink. We were served our ice tea, and were surprised that it was flavored, which I cannot stand!! If it is not advertised as flavored (tropical flavor) then it should not be flavored. I returned mine. I just want normal ice tea people! Shortly out of nowhere another guy (who is not our waiter) walks up and says he is there to take our order...what??? Weird!! Ok, whatever... The food comes and it looks great, but that is where it stops....the ribs were not the greatest, and had a strong taste of vinegar in them....I only ate them because they were 17.00, otherwise I would have not bothered. It does not stop there, with the coleslaw tasting the same...of vinegar and just plain dirt.  My husbands burger was dry, and just blah. The mac and cheese was dry and nasty.  What went wrong here, we are not sure...but it was just WRONG!! The establishment has two bathrooms (both uni-sex) which I thought very inconvenient, for as I walked out of the bathroom, there was a line to use the restroom. Strange!!  Overall, we were not impressed with The Windsor...and unfortunately will not be returning. We are not the kind to try to find fault with places, and we truly love places like Joyride Taco (across the street) and Federal Pizza, and we enjoy trying new places, this just was not the place for us.

Aside from my obsession with this salad, it's a cool spot on Central north of Camelback.  There's a good size parking lot adjacent to the small strip of businesses.  There is an ice cream spot next door which is really good, too.  They have outdoor seating.  It's a must visit if you want to just enjoy a drink and munch on their food.

However, despite the creative menu and potential the food did not live up to expectations.  We waited for almost a full hour to seated and during that time a hostess served us a cocktail from the menu. I had a bourbon grapefruit cocktail and my boyfriend had an interesting chai flavored whiskey drink. Both were very good. For starters we had the deviled egg dip and chips which I will say was quite good and filling. Where it fell short was with the crab cake sandwich. As a disclaimer having spent some time in the Baltimore/DC area which is notorious for oversized delicious crab cakes I have certain expectations. Unfortunately this sandwich fell far short from those expectations but it was a good try.   The portions are huge, the service was friendly but overall there is lack in taste for what the creative menu claims to offer.",

    "text": "Great ambiance and love the backyard, patio feel. Windsor seems like such an awesome  and hip place to chill and grab a drink after work. They are able to mesh a bunch of different environments together in a tiny space really well. You can catch a game at the bar, get seated in a romantic table, or enjoy the outdoors with their patio seating. The food is pretty good, and they have a great selection of drinks. You're paying for what you get, so it's not on the inexpensive side. My favorite part is the fact that it's connected to Churn!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to take a bike  ride  through a couple of fun locations filled with  trendy restaurants and shops. We came across this  hip place that seemed quite busy at the time. It was definitely a  fun brunch spot with  GREAT people watching,  which is one of my favorite things to do:)  There's some great patio seating if u come early enough  before the crowd. There's also indoor seating with tables, booths, and bars stools. We chose the bar stools where we could see everyone else:)(  They offered a nice brunch menu with some unique choices of specialty drinks at a very reasonable price!  We both split the Pitcha of Pimms, which was very refreshing and  chose the Simple Life , which included any style eggs, bacon, and an English muffin. My feeling is that if u can't  make the simple stuff everything else more than likely won't be great.  The chef truly did a great job and the food was on point.   The bartender offered us great customer service. He accidentally ordered only one entree for us and when he realized his mistake he quickly apologized and took the second  order of the simple life off the bill.   Overall, we really enjoyed hanging out here and will definitely be back with other friends!",

In spite of how busy it appeared we were both sat immediately and received prompt service. The menu includes many American classics but each are fancied up. We ordered a burger and the the fried chicken and both were delicious. To make it even better we were given tickets for free ice cream next store at the end of our meal. I would recommend the Windsor for a casual night out on the town and some good eats.",

You have a choice between Red or Green Bloody Mary drinks. The Red is traditional with a little kick and Green reminds me of Sofrito for some reason. I really wish I knew the best way to garnish the Green Bloody Mary. I had the Eggs Benedict, the sauce ham and poach egg was perfect. I wish the English muffin and a little crisp to it , but it was still really good.",

We waited an hour for a table--which can be expected--but add to that the fact that the service was really poor (uncaring, bitchy wait staff) and the food that was terrible, and I can safely say that I will not be returning here.  I had a mixed grain salad with chicken.  It was awful.  I ate maybe five bites and was done with it.  One of the many servers (we had 4 or 5) even agreed that the chicken looked poor.  Also had the corn dog bites for an appetizer and, honestly, I think they were just some frozen deal from Costco.  Save your money, and your time, and avoid this place.",

They are all $3 and are REALLY tasty! We always get the Fried Okra & Chilled Bean Salad both SO GOOD! My bf loves the Jo's Church Potatoes & Mac & Cheese. These are all $3 so you can try tons of them! Better than apps in my opinion. My next on my list to try is Chopped Kale Salad mmm.  Ok so to the meals, since I'm a veg I always get Mixed Grain Salad (Black quinoa, kamut, pearled barley, roasted butternut squash, oven dried tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, baby beets, currants & ricotta salata with orange basil vinaigrette --- all this for NINE DOLLARS!) My bf LOVES the Porkwich $12 (Pulled pork, Tenderbelly braised ham & smoked bacon layered with gold sauce & crunchy coleslaw on a buttermilk bun). He has tried a few other things but he always says this is the best. They have wine on tap if you don't want a bottle, I usually get a glass or two of Palmina, Pinot Grigio, Santa Barbara - really good even if its \"on tap\".  Overall GREAT restaurant, staff is always friendly. Usually packed which makes it even funner :)",

Our server was really nice and on top of things. We got our drinks in a timely manner, and they weren't too expensive either!

After waiting a decent amount of time (at least 20-30 min), we had not only our server, but also the manager and another employee, come up to us and apologize genuinely and profusely. I think it was worth the wait! I had the chicken sandwich with mac n cheese, which was absolutely delicious! My dad had the burger with okra, which was also quite yummy!  To top it off, because of the long wait, they comped our food! It was totally unnecessary, but definitely solidified that we'd return! Can't wait to try Churn next time!",

    "text": "so. good.   i ordered the fish \"banh mi\" and... it was so freakin' good. whilst i do wish it was in a more traditional banh mi style bread (baguette vs round bun), it had the perfect amount of heat and i totally dug the interpretation. and the kale salad? o.m.gooooooodness. i know the mac and cheese is good and all... but you HAVE to get the kale salad. it is green perfection. and so good for your eyes!  the husband had the burger which was.... uhm, possibly the best burger i've had in arizona??? yeah. it was like that. juicy and perfectly cooked. with a side of church potatoes - what what???? that was like the ultimate comfort food meal right there. ULTIMATE. it was delectable.   bro got the porkwich... that much pig on a piece of bread honestly scares me... but it really truly worked. and i understood why people are fanatical about it. his side of mac and cheese? now THAT, my friends is a good m&c. it was cheeeeeeeeesy up the heezy, and no weird liquidy sauce, the pasta shape didn't put me off. i wanted to swim in that mac and cheese. ok, maybe not because that was a hottttt little dish, but... i really really really really loved it. and wanted to steal it and eat it all. now that i'm revisiting that experience, i dunno how i feel about that kale salad. i'm torn. i choose both.  my dad had the reuben, which to me is a man-which. it was decent, just not my flava.  my mom had either the brown bag chicken or the grilled chicken. i don't remember because my bro's gf had the other one. they were both good and i am not a big chicken sandwich fan. perhaps not phenomenal, but i would venture to say i might at some point be persuaded to order a chicken sandwich from here.   we had the deviled egg dip... the chips were good, but the dip was kinda forgettable.  service was amazing, the ambiance and decor... impeccable.   there are a lot of new pretentious phx area eateries that are similar to this one... all in all, windsor is at the top.  valet is free... or you can park on the street a little further past the restaurant.",

    "text": "I came here about a month ago, just randomly on a weekend, because we were looking for a decent breakfast/brunch place. Luckily, this place was listed in my bookmarks. The food menu is not huge but it covers the ground in terms of variety. Their beverage list actually seemed longer.  Anyways, we ordered the deviled egg dip and chips and Russian roulette for appetizers. The dip was amazing and the mix of peppers in the russian roulette were great. I suggest taking a small bit to test the peppers if you're not sure. For entree, we ordered the Veggie Stack and  Porkwich. Again, another hit and the veggie stack was a pleasant surprised...it was relatively healthy and tasty. We had a few of the sides but the only one I remember is the mac n' cheese. If you come here, GET IT! It is some of the best mac n' cheese I've had in a long time.  For dessert, you can just head next door to Churn with is an old school ice-crean and candy shop.    The prices were on the reasonable/slightly expensive side. For the food and service, I will definitely be making a drive back to downtown PHX soon.",

I usually visit during the HH time. Just cause it makes sense, due to there extended HH times it makes it very easy to visit during those time where my scheduled needs to be flexible.      The 5 times I have visited it was enjoyable. I cant say even think of a con worthy of noting.   Well Done Windsor.  NOte: If you are reading  a grip of reviews, I am sure you noticed the parking here is for the diligent and patient. Good luck trying to find a parking spot in the parking lot.  This only adds to the persevered intimacy and inclusiveness.",

I ordered a hefeweizen to go with the sandwich, and had a small pitcher returned to the table instead. Turns out it was happy hour and it was only $5 for about 3 pints.   Not bad at all.

    "text": "Not bad....  Think Postino's, Vig, Tuck Shop, and St. Francis in terms of design, ambience, parking, and lighting.  The Windsor's menu is a little different and considerably more sandwich-oriented than the foregoing restaurants, and the servers are a tad more 'edgy' looking, but the Windsor can more or less stand as a lunchtime equal with them.  But I did suffer with a rather serious problem during my visit - strictly related to the food itself.  I ordered the Crab BLT, an intriguing idea on paper, and a very attractive plate once it is set before your eyes.  I selected Jo Church's potatoes as my side dish.  My wife ordered the Schreiner's sausage with cole slaw.  The good:  The Schreiner's sausage was amazingly flavorful and quite well dressed with peppers and the like.  The thick 'Tenderbelly Bacon' crumbled throughout my Crab BLT was perfectly cooked with a slight char.  And the BUNS, oh those delicious toasted, buttered buns!!!  The not-so-good:  They seemed to really just phone-it-in on the side dishes.  The cole slaw my wife ordered seemed right out of a Basha's bag or something in terms of appearance and flavor, and the Jo Church's potatoes (creamy, shredded hash browns) were cold, undercooked, and underseasoned.  Indeed, the potatoes were on the threshold of being simply \"bad and bland\" which is quite a sad feat considering the taters looked so good.  Also, the music did seem a tad bit on the loud side for a place like this.  The downright FOUL:  I can't help it, I wish I didn't have to say it, but I do....the crab in my crab cakes was absolutely, positively foul.  It was well breaded, well cooked, and well seasoned, so the fault did not lie in the execution, but rather in the senile old grandpa of a crab they used for my cakes.  For such a flaw to be so apparent in what is supposed to be the star of my dish, I must issue the dreaded punitive star rating.  :(   I suspect I will be revising this review in the future, and in an upward direction in terms of stars.  There was quite a bit of good things in the air and on the plate that warrants a second visit, and if I order just right, I suspect I will come away with a very happy, four star experience.",

This was the start of less than stellar service. I had a grain salad which was delicious & my husband had a burger & a side of Mac n cheese that he emphatically declared were both really good.

I'm sure they get a million requests, and I was happy to get a call back 48 hours later that the gift was ready.  A great restaurant that also gives back to the community.  Bonus points!

Someone finally let us know that Windsor is in the same family.  Specialty cocktails was the perfect way to start the meal.  No 29 for the lady, but No 63 is definitely a gentleman's drink.  Bourbon just warms the soul.   Was really happy with the overall quality of the meal.  The chicken sandwich and the Brown Bag Chicken sandwich were great. Fav sides were the Kale salad and Broccoli with aioli...sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  The interior has an warm cozy feeling...especially since x-mas is right around the corner.  The outdoor patio would be great in warmer weather.  Ordered a 2nd round of drinks and then walked thru the back hallway to grab some cookies from Churn.  Stolled back to the cushy booth to relax with my drink and sweet.  All in all only ran about $50 for 4 drinks and 2 meals.  Wish I lived closer!",

The BBQ sauce is more on the savory/spicy side and fall off the bone. The sides we like are fried Okra (YUM!), Mac N Cheese and French fries. The picnic kebobs are one of the \"lighter\" dinner options and healthiest. The kebobs come with a few dipping sauces, pita bread, and veggies. Meat is tender and has great flavor.",

At age 60 I have just eaten the best sweet potato fries I have ever had. Crispy and perfectly seasoned. The veggie burger was super on a tall brioche bun. Got there @ 4:57 pm and they promised to give me the up-to-5pm Happy Hour prices. My Pimms cup ended up being a Pimms pitcher (admittedly lots of ice and lots of refreshing non-alcoholic mixers in with the Pimms. Definitely delighted I came!!",

Great atmosphere, slightly \"hipster\", but food and drinks are always great. Plus you can get dessert next door at Churn! 4 stars because the banh mi fish sandwich is mehh and the bread-to-crab cake ratio is off for the crab cake sandwich. The porkwich and rueben are both really good. You can also never go wrong the church potatoes and mac and cheese.",

The menu actually had several things we wanted to try, so we  will surely be back for more. Great ambiance, staff and food. My tomato soup was so fresh and flavorful. His pastrami Rueben was delish(so I was told:-) It's was a magical night!",

I'm always impressed when a restaurant is slammed and the server is able to keep their cool. The woman who helped us out today was just that. She was quick and efficient but was still able to give us quality attention. We were seated outside and like I said before it was pouring. She made a point to keep checking in on us to make sure we were comfortable and not getting wet.   We ordered the donut holes, simple life breakfast and biscuits and gravy. It was all delicious! The vanilla mascarpone that came with the donut holes was fantastic! My only complaint would be that the scrambled eggs were a bit dry. But I'm pretty picky about eggs. I was also given an Arnold Palmer to go as we were leaving which is a major bonus.   All in all, the restaurant has great parking, ambience, food and service.",

I finally made if back for dinner, and loved it!  Both times I was here the patio (which seems to be popular) was packed so the groups I was with sat inside. I don't remember much about the brunch service, but our waiter for dinner was excellent. He was friendly and knew the menu well.   I got the grilled chicken sandwich w/mango relish and it was so good! The chicken was juicy & tender. For a side, I got whatever they call the cheesy hashbrown thing. Again, yummy (if you couldn't tell just by the sound of it). Everyone else I was with seemed happy with there meals as well. I had a couple bites of my mom's Reuben (and I normally don't like Reuben's) and it was delicious. The sauerkraut on it is not slimy & moist (which I find most sauerkrauts to be, which is why I don't like it). It's drier (in a good way) so the bread & meat taste dry (again, in a good way) as well.  I also love the beer HH special that they have here. $5 for a pitcher. It's actually a mini-ish pitcher, but it's for any beer on tap (we're not talking Bud Light) so it's a good deal. They also have an HH deal for wine and cocktails. Again, $5 & it's everyday until 5 pm. I'll be back.",

From the hipster servers that do \"community serving\" to the aesthetics of the friendly \"patio\" outdoor & indoor feel, you'll enjoy your time at Windsor for both the food and the service. They have excellent mixed drinks and they have a top notch burger.   We enjoyed the cheddar fondue with pretzel, apples & sausage... which was so good. And then i ordered the backyard burger Windsor style with caramalized onions and the #23(? I think) drink - which is a refreshing vodka lemonade with a blackberry puree. Server told me it was a sweet drink but I wanted a cool refreshing lemonade so opted to have light puree in the drink (which they were more than happy to do). My second drink was inspired by the server - I wanted to not order a drink because I wanted to run to Churn for some ice cream but I also wanted to enjoy a bevy so he suggested and convinced me to enjoy a root beer float with a shot of Jameson and a scoop of Churn's bourbon nut ice cream and MAN did I ever enjoy that!!!!! The rootbeer was top shelf and the icrecream complimented by the Jameson was simply delectable.   Do try the Mac & cheese as your side, it will have you licking the plate - as they claim you'll need to do on their website!",

I went for the Crab Cake Sandwich w/ Sweet Potato Fries and the Mixed Green Salad. Phenomenal!

While this is normally a bad thing, these guys just worked together on everything... drink orders were taken quick, a drink runner dropped them off, I think a manager took an app order... so on and so on... they literally never missed a beat. It was for that reason, along with the great food, that we tipped 50% of our bill.  The Bacon Cheeseburger - 5 stars Cheddar Jalapeno Cornbread - 4 stars Kale Caesar Salad with Salmon - 5 stars Mac n Cheese - 3 stars (good, but nothing exceptional)  As you can read in other posts... they have several craft drinks on the menu... I cannot recall which we had, but they were all quite tasty.  So... on to Trip 2... (literally 7 days later, don't judge) - this visit was also great, but either the staff was having an off night or maybe they were a little busier, it was a little bit later than our first visit. But the teamwork wasn't quite like it was during trip 1. It didn't hurt our view on the place enough to knock it down a star, but I guess it did take the \"Windsor\" out of my sails a bit (see what I did there? Lol).   Wife got the same Kale Caesar Salmon salad - 5 stars I got the grilled chicken sandwich... a little but of kick, very good - 4 stars Loaded potato skins - 3 stars (good, a little too crisp and inconsistent for my tastes)  We will definitely be back! (Maybe not the very next week this time, lol)",

The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable of their offerings. I typically enjoy the Berkeley Veggie Burger with a side of Sweet Potato fries...don't forget the ranch or the Veggie Stack did I mention the hummus and pickled beets are to die for?! If you get lucky and dine in on either Wednesday or Thursday you can grab Mick's Fish and Chips...don't skimp on the tartar sauce!  No matter what you will not be disappointed with your meal.",

The decor and patio are beautiful on a nice day, you can easily spend a couple hours eating and drinking away. The $5 drinks are a steal with some really great cocktails.  Service was good, never seemed like we were waiting a long time for drinks or for someone to check on us.   The veggie burger can use some more flavor, the fries are thin and salty and perfect. They are such a big portion for the price!  Pretzel and cheese fondue is a fun/different appetizer, they were nice enough to let us sub pretzels for sausage.   Can't wait to come back and try more drinks. Also the ice cream next door is worth a stop over afterwards!",

The Seasonal peppers sauteed in lemon, olive oil, parmesan & sesame seeds, served with Harissa aioli, some are hot & some are not! It's called Russian Roulette. It's my favorite appetizer, it's great when you first got started with a couple of drinks during happy hour or if you're just sitting down for a nice meal. \"Side note I've never had a super hot pepper\". As for cocktails they have a nice selection I like the 17 and the 86, I lean towards the 86 more often because of my love for coconut.  I Didn't even know that coconut bourbon existed, It's delicious. It's a great spot to have brunch or to have that drink after a hard week at work. The outside patio is spacious and covered which is perfect for this time of the year.",

The Windsor is as elegant as it's name without being overbearing. Indoor and outdoor seating with a horseshoe bar. Very comfortable, subdued lighting, dark earthy colors, perfect for a date or a business lunch. The airy patio is out back, shielded from the noise of Central Ave and Camelback. Ample parking, very friendly staff, full bar with a nice selection of craft beers. I was with a close friend and restauranteur, we had a lot of stops to make that day so I ordered a Coffee Brown brewed by The Shop Beer Co. It was correct in every sense. Our appetizer was grilled chilies that came with a nice dipping sauce, these were salted, some mild some spicy. I love chilies and this worked for me! We split a Crab Sandwich and the barkeep recommended their, I'm going to say string potatoes in cheddar cheese and sour cream? These were excellent! The crab sandwich had something crunchy in it, walnuts perhaps? Not sure but dang it was good! I'd highly recommend The Windsor and believe you should give it a try! On the east side of Central just north of Camelback, right next to The Churn ice cream shop",

After sampling a few more eats in Phoenix, I had to bump Windsor up to a 5 for a few reasons:  1. Whoever runs the bar is amazing, because the taps are impeccably clean as evidenced by the fact that any beer you have at Windsor tastes better than pretty much anywhere else you get can get the same draft. Definitely makes for a nice dining experience, especially when you're having $5 pitchers during happy hour.  2. Amazing brunch, with a simple but sufficient menu. The Matador is great, and the accompanying salsa verde brings your tastebuds pretty close to heaven. The chef poaches eggs perfectly. And bloody mary bar: need I say more?  3. Anyone who can make kale taste this good is a hero. Mac&cheese is wonderful without feeling too heavy/greasy/depressing. Fries are yummy, too, which isn't always the case at nice restaurants.  4. Wonderful, large, shaded patio with comfortable seating that has large heaters to warm you up during the cool weather.",

The food for the price is only okay, i wish it was either better or cheaper by a few bucks (both would be great, but this is the real world). I've had a few decent burgers and sandwiches but they are on the small side and will not \"wow\" you. The beer selection could be bigger but the beers I've had all very tasty.  Huge bonus: next door to the place is churn! Delicious, possibly life changing ice cream. You should definitely go there afterward.",

The flavors were balanced and the seafood was fresh.  I had the burger, medium, and it was one of the best burgers I've had in Phoenix. It loses points because of the fries, which reminded me of McDonalds fries. My wife had the kabob, which she enjoyed thoroughly.

    "text": "While the presentation can be impressive at first sight, the food leaves a lot to be desired.   It was my first time at the Windsor, went in on a Sunday afternoon looking for some respite from the heat. The darkened interior was very inviting and the crowd was lively. We sat in a booth and were quickly asked if we had been helped. Speaking of just the service alone, it was absolutely 5 stars. It's the food that takes the Windsor down a couple pegs.  First we ordered the ceviche. Seemed standard enough, hard to mess something up like a simple ceviche. Somehow, the kitchen brought out a sort of \"deconstructed\" ceviche, just completely the opposite of what a traditional ceviche would be. If you've ever had Mexican Mariscos, you'll remember that it will sometimes be on the spicier side, completely drowning in Clamato. This ceviche just screamed \"Overcomplicated\", there's mango in it for fucks sake. Imagine it in layers; mango and some cucumbers on the bottom, shrimp placed on top, jalapeno(or possibly serrano) peppers above that, diced in such a way that instead of getting small bites of pepper, you would get a mouthful of pepper and just torch your taste buds. Then, avocado slices and cilantro meandering on top with no real use. Because the avocado was in slices, it was hard to get any of it in the ceviche, meaning you were eating it SEPERATE from the bite of ceviche. The chips as well were too thin. Crispy yes, just lacking in fortitude.  After that let-down, we split a chicken sandwich. I thought to myself \"Spicy chicken sandwich, hard to fuck that up\". Boy was I wrong. It was a juicy piece of chicken breast that was grilled instead of fried, that smelled fantastic and yet tasted completely bland. My nose was telling that it should be smokey and spicy yet my tongue was flabbergasted by the complete lack of flavor. It was served on a soft and toasted bun, filled with some fresh greens and I believe some house made mayo. For some reason though, this sandwich was the return of those dreaded mangos. There was a layer at the bottom that also lacked flavor and added nothing to the sandwich. It's not that the flavor was subtle, it was non-existent. I'm not one to suggest a change but I believe that if it was instead done as a crispy chicken breast, with peppers mixed in with the flour and then fried, we would have a much better sandwich. We ordered sweet potato fries as a side and after what I had experienced at that point, they were a pleasant surprise and were crispy and delicious.  Drinks on the other hand were just short of excellent. I had a Moscow Mule that was sweet and tangy, great drink to escape the heat. I just wish the food matched the quality of the drinks and the service. It's a shame because I live just a few blocks away and would love to take my friends there. For now, it looks like we'll go elsewhere for our dinner and drinks.",

    "text": "We had a great experience at Windsor. Loved the atmosphere and the service was great as well. When trying a place for the first time I like to ask for a recommendation. The bartender suggested the #17 or #76. I really enjoyed the #76 which was similar to a blood orange margarita. He called it a \"party drink\" and I would have to agree. After 2 I was feeling a little toasty. We also tried a side of macaroni and cheese and a side of fried okra just as a small snack. The Mac n cheese was creamy and also baked with bread crumbs on top. Some of the best I've had in a while. My friend thought she didn't care for okra but found out having it friend was good, of course! It's fried!!! ;) would definitely like to come back for happy hour or a meal to try more items from their unique menu! Me",

The \"church potatoes\" cheesy hashed brown casserole side definitely had onion it it despite what the server said, and some other things besides potatoes and cheese (I didn't dwell on it and just ate it).  She also didn't know what a hashed brown casserole was, which I found strange.  The potatoes were also cold, which was a big disappointment.  My bacon burger also was not served hot, and you could tell it had been cooking for a while.  It was perfectly cooked and very juicy though!  The sauce (worcestershire-based) was really good, though the bacon was extremely crispy (as in zero moisture left in it - still tasty though).  The bun wasn't that special, and should've been toasted, maybe with a bit of butter to crisp it up.  Dining companion liked his crab cake sandwich.  Our waters were kept full, and besides not knowing the menu as well as she should and getting our food out promptly so it was still hot, the waitress provided good service.  Overall, not bad, but food is served fresh and hot at Ingo's and Zinburger, so they need to step up their game.",

Most of us in the industry get to the point where we crave variety which makes us venture out into our neighborhoods to see what everyone else is offering.  I found myself on the quirky Windsor patio this past weekend.  It was around 10 pm, we were seated and greeted by our server very promptly.  The patio itself is in the round.  Plush intimate booths surround by what I refer to as \"card tables\" and plaid backed chairs that remind me a little of 1960's kitsch poker.  Very cute.  Reminds me of my grandmother's basement and I mean this as a whole hearted compliment.  We are brought water.  My glass had a chip on the rim.  No big deal. It was replaced immediately with the right tone and amount of sincerity from our server.  I ordered the lobster roll.  No skimping on the good stuff.  It's mayonnaise based (not too much), hints of tarragon, red bell pepper and the snap of celery and the obligatory shredded lettuce.  Served on a \"hot dog\" styled bun.  Just the way it should be and as I remember from the east coast.  One suggestion.  The bun is a just a little too thick.    My friend ordered the ribs.  He was very happy.  The bones were spaced well.  Meaning, an abundance of meat. Pork ribs are sometimes dicey.  You're taking a risk ordering them because in the United States, there is no grading system for pork like there is for beef, ie, select, choice and prime.  I wish America would adopt the European pork grading system.  I digress.  These people obviously care about their suppliers and the quality.    I can't wait to come back and try more!  Keep it up, Windsor!",

A cucumber, green tea and mint cocktail. I get one almost every time I visit...and I always try to visit during their half priced happy hours that go until 5pm, even on Saturdays. For a week night, it is kind of an odd ending time for a happy hour...no post work specials if you're working a 9-5.   I've only eaten here a couple times, and the last time I had the mac and cheese side dish. I'm a sucker for mac and cheese when I see it on any moderate to upscale menu. It was heavenly! Creamy, topped with bread crumbs and finished in the oven for a nice 'crust'.   I will continue to be a patron and every time I introduce friends to what Central Phoenix has to offer, Windsor is at the top of the list.",

I ordered the brown bag chicken salad sandwich, the chicken salad needed salt and the chicken was chewy and dry. The goat cheese overwhelmed the entire thing, I ended up wiping most of it off because to was all that I could taste. My husband ordered the fried chicken which is supposed to be amazing and it tasted like straight oil. The cheddar fondue was good, but I would rather have the fondue from Culinary Dropout or Citizen's Public House. Maybe we just ordered wrong? We will probably give it another shot, but with super low expectations. I will say the staff was amazing! Our waiter was so nice and our glasses were never empty.",

You enter through the back patio seating area which is fun, not as crowded as you would think. We were told we would have about a fifteen minute wait, but the wait only ended up being five minutes which we appreciated. It took maybe 5-10 minutes for our waitress to greet us, a bit longer than usual but I didn't find that super distracting. We ordered the deviled egg dip to start- this thing was super cool. They deconstructed devils egg, and served it in a dish as a dip (they topped it with gorgonzola and bacon bits too!), with potato chips to dip in it; I was super impressed with the creativity. For dinner I had the market fish (it was salmon), smothered in a tomato based sauce, with jasmine rice on the side. The fish was cooked very well, buttery on the inside, and nice thick skin. The presentation of the food was average, it didn't add or detract from the meal. My friend had the caesar salad with chicken. She said the salad was average, but the chicken came on skewers almost shaped like shrimp, I thought it was neat.   This place was good, I would definitely recommend it to someone, but I don't know if I would return. Not because it was bad, but because I personally would classify it as a \"one and done\" type of place.",

Now I know how hard it is on a server to deal with a table with 20 people who don't all arrive at the same time, but it seems that those of us who got there a little late (about 10 or 15 minutes) were pretty much ignored until the first round of drinks were done and they were ordering food. THEN the rest of us ordered our drinks...and food. The food was OK, I had the loaded chips (which had a lot more chips than the 'loaded' part) and a glass of wine. Others in the party had burgers etc that looked pretty good.  We were all told by the host to bring cash as they only would provide one check (which is totally understandable) but I was not prepared for the valet parking, so I needed to break a 20. Oh my gosh, you would think I was asking for the moon....the server was so put out.  The place was full and very very noisy. It was almost impossible to talk to anyone in the party who wasn't sitting right next to you. I think if I went back, I would go with a smaller party and sit in one of the leather booths along the side.",

The ambience is ok. kind of a hipster vibe. The service staff was very friendly. My issue was with the food. I brought my 4 year old during lunch time and we were seated right away. They had a kids menu which was great. Decent choices and great price. She got the corn dogs with mac and cheese and fresh fruit and lemonade. The lemonade was super sour. Not something a kid would enjoy or an adult to be honest. Her mac and cheese tasted really weird/bad and she didnt eat it so it must have been really bad cuz the kid would eat just about any mac n cheese as long as it was made simply. Fancy mac n cheese isnt her thing. She liked the corn dog nuggets and the fruit was pretty basic but tasted good. I got the crab cake blt on a bed of lettuce (no bread). The crab cakes were bland and cold. I also got the kale salad which I didn't like but that may be that I barely tolerate kale on a good day and was forcing myself to eat my daily dose of greens. Overall, I might be persuaded to come back to try something else on the menu but I think I'll just stick with going to Churn or maybe meeting friends at Windsor for happy hour or apps.",

Last night I had the Cheddar Fondue: it's a white cheddar with warm pretzel pieces, sausage, and apple slices...it was pretty tasty, I'd definitely recommend it. They also have a cassette tape lined wall near the bathroom (they collected a bunch of cassette tapes from the community when they first opened to make this decoration).

I had the pork sandwich and it was more than enough food and was so good. My friends both got salads and they absolutely loved them.

Like Postino before it, Windsor's staff is awesome and make you feel like part of the family the second you walk in the door!   I have and will continue to send people to Windsor!

The kale salad is awesomely delicious depending on who is back there in the kitchen. The consistency of the food is my only complaint. The fondue appetizer is yummy but I am a sucker for hot pretzels. It's one of my favorite places to go and they have a great happy hour.",

Still good food and atmosphere but not as great as the first year it was open. They must have had a kitchen manager change towards the end of last year as that's when these changes took place and the food dropped in quality.",

Decided to eat dinner at the bar, it gave off such a good vibe.  Bar service was excellent and the mojitos were very good.  The portion sizes looked big so we split the Banh Mi whitefish sandwich with a kale salad on the side.  Delicious!  Still hungry so we ordered the fried okra with ranch on the side.  It was just ok.  I did hear the side of mac n cheese is the best so I'll have to try that next time!    Really decadent salted peanut butter ice cream for dessert next door at Churn.  Solid good food in a relaxed, hip atmosphere (check out their wall of cassette tapes...I found Night Ranger and the Flashdance soundtrack).  Can't wait to go back!",

Most bars don't even know what a Tom Collins is let alone get the 150 year old long drink right, but they seem to get it spot on every time.

    "text": "I have found a new place close to downtown to eat.  Great place to enjoy lunch and the $5 pitchers are a great enticer. If that does not get you down here maybe the great patio will get you here or the spacious bar.  I could see myself eating at the bar or one of the super comfortable booths. As for the eats....The backyard burger, Windsor style is on my list of must eat again, porkwich is a must eat all the time, and the mac and cheese is a great side.  I can't cook mac and cheese like that at home, nice crisp top of melted cheese and uber yummy cheese and pasta under neath.   The Windsor burger and piggy burger were great.  Just ask for extra napkins since you will look like a Carl's Jr commercial trying to scarf either burger down.  They are both messy, but I could not let the sauce and juice go to waste just dip the burger into the left overs on the plate. :)  Let me describe the porkwich please....  Pulled pork, belly braised ham, cold slaw, smoked bacon, and the yummy sweet gold sauce.  All this on a buttermilk bun which is soft and a great absorber of all that sauce and flavor.  Get you eat on quick so the bun does not go soggy on you.   The backyard burger has a great garlic aioli, caramelized onions, sharp cheddar, and some iceberg shredded up to add some color.  This was a great burger and even though it is a must eat again I am really a fan of the porkwich.   My only downside is parking, really only a hand full of parking and then free valet.  Nothings free, I still gotta tip a guy that has to run down the street to get my car.  That's usually where your car will end up is down a side street adjacent to the restaurant.  I think the valet thing does fix the lack of parking problem and the food is so good it really is not that big of a deal.   If you are ever in the general vicinity of Windsor I suggest you give it a shot, great staff, great food, and great overall restaurant.",

My biggest beef is that the service was awful 2 times and very average the other time!!  We had to have the chef (and i think he was the owner) help us the last time.  Our waitress actually disappeared completely.  Before she disappeared, we needed to call her over if she wasn't acting like we were invisible.  Also bad, is that the menu is basically a few sandwiches and burgers, unless you want ribs.  Both the chicken and crab sandwiches I've had are over-priced/ under-sized.  I went specifically for KING fried chicken on the one night they have it, and it was small, and just okay.",

Behind the building is kind of like an open corridor space - across from which is a patio structure. They have a well-stocked full bar with 7 or 8 wines on \"tap\" and a whole bunch of craft beers. The menu is comprised of a few appetizers, salads and sandwiches, everything priced below $12 or so. Unfortunately for me I try to avoid carbs which means ordering a salad for dinner, not something I do often. I settled for the halibut sandwich - and took off the bun. The fish, fancy mayo and veggies were a perfect blend, fish was cooked perfectly...  BOTTOM LINE: I'll probably make a habit of drinking here and dining elsewhere",

    "text": "First impressions last, unfortunately for Windsor.   The parking. Yuck. Six cars deep waiting for valet, no thanks. Especially in a lot the size of a fat Circle K.  It was small enough that I didn't even bother trying, I just parked down the street (which I'm sure locals are just in love with already).    Then, while there are indeed like six doors to the place, none seem to be the main entrance. I finally just went in the one that was open, you know, right by the bathrooms. All of the ones along the 'front' are knuckle deep in people's tables so those are awkward.  Now on to trying to get a seat. My friend and I walked up to the bar. The overhead speaker was going to make conversation a pain in the head so we walked over to what looked like a waiter station. And then we stood there. Then we stood some more. I considered at one point calling them and asking if there was somebody who could come over and seat us. At least for my ego, after being seated, I noticed several other people walk up to doors, look in side, and then walk away, to finally wander inside and stand around looking for what to do next.    We were finally asked by a young lady, sitting with friends and food at the first booth, if we needed help. I thought it odd that a customer was asking us if we needed help and I thought maybe I should think of something funny to say because she's kinda cute and I wonder if she's trying to....oh wait, I think she works here?  It turned out it was the hostess who had been letting us stand there, three feet away, gawking like idiots while she hung out with friends, chatting and eating.   After asking if we should just seat ourselves or if there was somebody we were supposed to ask about it or if we were in the wrong place she grabbed us menus and nabbed us a table.   At this point, and I'm only on a passing fancy with snobbery, I was ready to write this place off. The initial experience was a 'if you can't figure us out, then you probably shouldn't be here' kind of thing. Not that it's rocket science but, seriously? If I have to *try* to get a table then next time I'm bringing my top hat and parrot.     Luckily for this place, once seated things got WAY better. Our waitress was happy, friendly, filled with information and suggestions, and made sure that I knew what was going on for happy hour. Win, win, win, thanks, and win. Things were looking up.    The happy hour specials are nice get off early, they don't last long.   The food was good. Not great, not knock your socks off, but a step up from the norm. The Russian Roulette Peppers (only one pepper in a dozen is predisposed for heat!) were a fun app, roasted and oiled.    I'm going to have to give the place another try. I truly did enjoy myself once I was entrenched. Both the experience of actually getting off my feet and the unfortunate too cool for my fixie Postino vibe should have been kept on lock down across the street but here's to hoping it grows on me more than the 'duce has.",

He ordered a greyhound from the bar and it was one of the best he has had; the grapefruit juice was very fresh. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich.   It was absolutely delicious - would order it again. The bun was lightly toasted, the seasonings were great, and there were nuts in the mix which added a nice crunch.  My side was the vegetable which was squash in a brown butter sauce which was great. The Reuben sandwich was very creatively done using Emmentaler cheese;  the bun was the perfect accompaniment - lightly toasted, soft texture.  We will definitely visit this place again soon.",

When I'm trying to pretend I'm even semi healthy, I like to get a good ten minute Tae-bo sweat in and get the kabobs after.  Their sides kill any other restaurants sides.  Between their always creative seasonal veg, their mac n' cheese, fried okra, and Jo's church potatoes?  Preach, and props.  The patio and inside are great, but you can't beat the chill bar-top at night.  Dope ambiance & music, perfectly timed service, consistently good food, and it's dim.  Not like, dark, but a comfortable dim.  Bright enough that you can't eye people all weird and get away with it, but dim enough that you can comfortably enjoy your interaction with whoever is with you and not feel like they can see your fat rolls.  I think this is the perfect balance when it comes to keeping freaks at bay.  Which brings me to my main reason for writing this.  So I'm here on date night with my girlfriend.  It's dim, we're chillin' on the far what I'd like to call the most north-west side of the bar-top.  We look over to the left, and what do we see?  To protect the innocent, we'll say Smelly Shelly.  There's a bit of history with this one, but we'll forego backstories.  Smelly Shelly is a total creeper that loves to prey on the weaker inhibitions of men like a succubus checking off her list as she watches some young frat boy drunkenly pee onto his own car tires.  She's a below the belt, no holds barred, wake up tied to bed posts with a glittery cheerio around your finger designating \"until death do you part\" kind of gal'.  Do you know how hard it is to keep a conversation entirely to the right of you, especially when you both naturally want to look around and judge everything?  It's horrible.  Developed a crick in my neck.  But, after multiple instances of accidental eye contact with Smelly Shelly via bathrooms trips (the hallway to the bathroom is covered with cassette tapes...beautifully hipster) and hush-hush side conversations with the bartender, Smelly Shelly eventually paid out and left with her next victim.  Turns out she tips bad.  Not surprised.  Shame.  Shame.  Five-star-loyal-A-B-A-B-B-B fatality Mortal Combat move with the 602 all day everyday on the real doe chico.  Shout out CyHi, good album bruh.  Shout out Hillary, great service and hair.  Shout out to that manager that chased us down the street one day to hook us up with dessert cuz' of that industry connect.  We appreciate you in the streets bruh.  Shout out to Lil Peep, rest in peace.  I had no idea who you were until you died, and I'd rather use this shout out for someone else, but as far as I know there weren't any other deaths today other than Charles Manson...and, well.  I'M OUTTY.",

We were seated in a roomy, comfortable booth/table hybrid and out server met with us almost immediately for drink orders. Bloody Mary's were $5 and included a trip to the extras buffet, which featured marinated olives and spicy pastes. The coffee was pretty \"meh,\" but flowed freely. Our food orders were taken, and the food started coming out before anyone could notice. I adored the Quinoa Oatmeal with vanilla Mascarpone, and my husband enjoyed the Cheddar Biscuits and Country Gravy. We also ordered a side of the pork belly bacon, which may or may not have been dipped in caramel. It was incredible.  Overall, a cozy and modern brunch/lunch spot with delicious food and friendly service.",

Service was equally great. (We had a few laughs because some of the servers carry backpacks to hold menus, straws, etc.... This must be the new hipster thing.)  My coworkers and I came here for my birthday lunch on a Monday. It is such an awesome place and all of the food looked amazing. I ordered the Crab Cake BLT... Yes, it is just as delicious as it sounds. It comes with a side and I got to try fried okra. I highly recommend! It is coated in a batter similar to corn dogs. My only disappointment was that I didn't get to choose my free dessert because the server automatically brought out ice cream with whipped cream. I'm lactose intolerant so I couldn't eat it, but the table enjoyed!   I will definitely be back to sample other menu items and the dinner menu!",

    "text": "I absolutely love Windsor! Is there anything Upward Projects does wrong? I have been here about a million times and it's amazing every time. I used to live in the neighborhood but even since I have moved I still go out of my way to come here for lunch. My go to lunch is the Fattoush salad with shrimp. This is probably the only salad I crave consistently and I haven't been able to perfect it at home yet. Another favorite menu item of mine is the loaded chips piled high with caramelized onion, bacon, and bleu cheese with chipotle crema, the only reason I don't get these every time is because I'm usually alone. The crab cake BLT and pastrami Reuben are also must haves.   True to the Upward Project motif, Windsor offers happy hour $5 pitchers, cocktails, and glasses of wine until 5pm. I personally am partial to the No. 17 {Cucumber Vodka | Green Tea Syrup | Fresh Cucumber | Mint} served up, this drink is so refreshing and the perfect addition to my solo lunch.   Service here is always great. If I'm not mistaken they have a team approach to service where you have several different people helping you and they pool tips. This can make it harder to find your actual server, but it also means that everyone is there to help with what you need.   I'll be coming here forever!",

The main reason why I wanted Windsor is because I remembered there Verde Mary, and that's what I wanted, something spicy with a kick! Man was I bummed out to learn that's not on the everyday menu, must be just a brunch thing, even Windsor was kickin me when I was down.  But I got over that soon and went with a black cherry lemonade, which was great tasting, fresh and not too sweet.  After checking out the menu, we started off with Corn Dog Poppers that came with fried pickles and ballpark mustard.  These lil corn dogs were delsih! It was a corn meal crust perfectly cooked, even the pickles were coated in the corn meal, it just was perfect! The pickles even came in quarters and slices, I thought that was pretty cool.  I went with the Grilled Chicken sandwich, it was a spicy curry rubbed chicken breast with a mango jalapeno mayo, red onion, spring greens & tomato on a hoagie roll. I have to say this was perfect! I love when chicken is mixed with fruit, I think mangos & pineapples are the best thing to pair with chicken, so mango jalapeno mayo was on point with me! Loved it!  But I do have to admit at some points I did have plate envy because all around me everything was having these huge beefy burgers, I might have to try one of those next time I am back!",

There is a large parking lot, just to the south of the restaurant, with ample parking. We checked into the hostess area and were told it would be a 45min to an hour wait. (We were a party of 6, so the wait for smaller groups could have been less). The restaurant uses a version of the No Wait app so I was able to see where we were in line, which is a great feature! We easily bided time by waiting in the beautiful outdoor patio, sipping $5 Bloody Mary's. They were delicious! They had a great Bloody Mary bar set up with lots of olives, pickles and hot sauce to doctor it up just the way you like it. (I believe that all of the cocktails are $5 before 5pm, if I am not mistaken). We were seated right at the hour mark at a big table in the front of the restaurant. The server was patient and very thourough, taking the time to explain different items on the menu with great detail. I ended up ordering the EggMan sandwich off of the brunch menu. Overall the sandwich was very tasy, but a bit too greasy for my liking. I ordered the cheesy potatoes as a side and they were delightful! If you are a fan of the creamy, cheesy potato casserole popular at Midwest get togethers you must order these. The biscuits and gravy were ordered by several in our party and they said they were delicious, but very rich. The pricing was affordable, with the total bill for a party of 6 (including 9 Bloody Mary's) was only $134. Overall, it was a nice meal shared with great people. I would definitely make Windsor's a regular on my brunch rotation if I lived in the area.",

And the bar they had to doctor it up was awesome. Olives and garnishes galore. And for $5 it can't be beat.   I had the porkwich which was fairly standard fare. It was a little soggy, which is to be expected with pulled pork, and the coleslaw was a nice compliment but none of the flavors jumped out at me. My friend ordered the veggie burger which she thought was pretty good if unremarkable.   The seating itself is a little crowded around the edges of the bar, but you're sure to get great service considering how hard it would be to ignore you.",

Twice I got a snarky response in regards to reservation, twice I was wrong...I give up.",

We've been wanting to try Windsor since we moved to Phoenix a few months ago and we finally stopped in for dinner and drinks last night. We had the best experience! The food does not disappoint, I had the best Old Fashioned I've ever had, and there's a really cool, fun vibe, but you know what is going to bring us back again and again? The service. Our servers (Brandon and Hills) were super personable, friendly and genuine. They were those hard to find kind of people that make you feel like you've been friends forever. We had their full attention when they were at our table, they were very knowledgable about the menu and spent time to give us recommendations. (Hills literally sat down at our booth and went through all of the side options on the menu for my picky husband. She knew every ingredient in each option, describing the coleslaw as having a good celery seed crunch. She ultimately convinced us to get the sweet potato fries and they were delicious!)  We ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich (which has a juicy, spicy curry-rubbed grilled chicken breast and mango jalapeno mayo), sweet potato fries on the side and the Seasonal Salad (butternut squash, roasted Brussel sprouts YUM!, kamut, green apple, walnuts and goat cheese).  I would eat that grilled chicken sandwich and salad as my last meal on Earth.. which is saying a lot because it's grilled chicken and salad.  After dinner, we realized that for the first time since we moved from Seattle to Phoenix, we weren't as homesick. Windsor took us both to a place that felt more like \"home\" and made us feel surrounded by people we know.  I simply can't recommend Windsor more. You won't regret trying this place out!",

They have a mini pitcher on their happy hour menu which was a good deal and a number of us enjoyed, the ones who weren't drinking enjoyed the Blackberry Lemonade which was very delicious and refreshing.  With that we decided to order their Loaded Chips to snack on while we ordered and waited on entrees. For our entrees we for the most part had similar selections the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Backyard Burger being the most popular selections. I personally had their Backyard Burger (Windsor Style) with sweet potato fries and it was absolutely delicious.   A couple of the people in our group went with the Veggie Stack and Picnic Kebobs both which were good. Only compliant was with the Picnic Kebobs not being as filling as they would seem.   The place price wise was also reasonable for the quality of food and service. Would absolutely come back!",

They were pretty good but I wish the cheese had been warmer. It's served with apples and sausage as well. I ordered their Berkeley veggie burger which was made with brown rice, pinto beans and bulgar wheat. It had avocado and greens on a brioche bun. It was kinda messy but in a good way because it was delicious. I needed a bit extra sauce (the lime aioli) and then it was even better. They have great fries too! The mac and cheese wasn't too shabby either. To be honest, I completely forgot what my friends ordered but I'll say we all liked our food and the service was attentive and friendly. Afterwards we opted to order Churn which they bring to the table, I did not know that! My only complaint about the icecream is that I ordered it in a cone, they forgot and brought me the cone separately so I had to build it myself. I don't know, it took away from the icecream experience I suppose. Nevertheless, I'd definitely eat at Windsor again! And.....Churn has one of the BEST ICECREAMS in the valley so definitely a must have.",

It was a friend's birthday tonight and the 5 of us in the party decided on coming to Windsor. The service was extremely slow in the dining room and it was not overly busy either. Waiting 10 minutes for our server to get us drinks, my party waited over 10 minutes for their beverages from the bar. I drank an entire glass of water, and then got a refill not noticing my glass was severely chipped. I cut my lip and I am terrified that I swallowed glass with my drink. My glass was not the only one that was chipped as well. The server apologized and said he would bring me another glass but he never did. I am a regular customer, I get the side kale salad frequently. This visit, it was pathetic and roughly 1/3 of the size as usual. My friend got the exact same salad as me and was disappointed as well. To top off the night, my friend was served raw meat and didn't notice until eating a piece of it. I believe she ordered some kabob dish. If she doesn't get sick I'll be surprised, the meat was so raw that my friend couldn't even cut through it.  The only enjoyable part of my experience was the fries that we ordered. Pretty disappointed from what used to be my favorite spot.",

We were just across the street a couple of weeks ago on another fun adventure and I made my hubby promise that in two weeks we'd be back here. And we did. They have a nice patio and yummy food and drinks.   The menu for brunch was small but it made things easier. We knew what we wanted and the flavor was delicious. I had the classic eggs Benedict with baby Dutch potatoes. Hubby had a classic breakfast.   My mimosa was perfection. It wasn't just a full cup of OJ. Several spots will pour a full glass of juice and barely no bubbly. But this was yummy.   We will certainly return to try the rest of the menu. It's located near everything.",

They have flaws... They are human. But what I LOVE is that they OWN 'em. They'll swallow any pride, throw out the apology and fully accept responsibility when they blow it. Its not often, but hey... Shit happens.   Tonight it happened... and unfortunately, the customer that had his to-go order mistakenly given to another customer was understandably bummed he'd have to wait a few more minutes while his order was re-made.  In True awesome fashion, management was there to apologize, throw out some comps, and let the customer know that this was not their standard... \"We are better than this\" was his words. But unfortunately, this customer still had an attitude, and couldn't be kind to another person... one who was apologizing, one who took responsibility and one who tried to make it right.... Of course he took the comp and shook the man's hand... But what would it have cost him just to be kind?! Say \"thank you\", and just be decent??   Try it... Its soooo much more fun than being a dick.",

Even after that, they treated us kindly. Their Mac and cheese is to die for! I highly recommend getting it as a side for whatever you get. I also got the scallops which was the fresh fish of the day. Cooked to perfection. It wasn't over cooked so it wasn't chewy but it wasn't undercooked either! It's definitely hard to get scallops at restaurants cause some places just can't get it right but it was definitely good here!",

On Saturday they do brunch till 1pm so we had both a breakfast and lunch/dinner menu to peruse. They also have a pretty extensive drink menu.   The booths are super comfortable. Our waiter came over promptly to get our drink orders. We all stuck with water, but people were around to refill our glasses promptly before they ever got close to empty.   I ordered the porkwich which was pulled pork, ham and bacon with gold sauce and coleslaw. You get to select a side and I went with the sweet potato fries. The flavor of the sandwich was excellent and the fries were awesome! Thinner and crispier than most sweet potato fries... some of the best I've ever had probably.   My girlfriend and friend both got a burger, they tried the Mac n cheese and cornbread as their sides. They said the burger was awesome and one of the best they've had in awhile. The Mac n cheese was decent too. The one total miss was the cornbread though... the only way we could all describe it was tasting like what a shoe store smells like.... yikes. Definitely would avoid ordering that.   Overall it was a pleasant experience, a cool spot and a solid meal. I'd return if in the area!",

We both tried a few of their different kabobs on sticks, and although very savory with some amazing sauces to go with, we were presented with the info that we could order all-meat, no veggies, but not that doing so would increase the price. Although it was only $3 more per kabob, it still caught us off guard when the bill arrived, and would've been good to know when ordering. Other than that, we had a nice dinner and enjoyed the vibe of the place.",

Great ambience, busy but not overly busy, a bit noisy but nothing more than what you would expect at a popular restaurant during a weekend evening. The back wall of the restaurant was open, creating a very open feel and combining the indoor and outdoor seating. The patio was cute and definitely would be enjoyable during the day when it's warm. The restaurant is also connected to Churn, the ice cream spot next door. Perfect way to end a dinner date!   Our service was excellent. The bartender helped us choose from the menu and gave excellent recommendations. He was super friendly and entertaining. I told him I was thinking of a salad and he recommended the fattoush (his wife's fav). I ordered the fattoush salad, no cheese, dressing on the side, add shrimp + a side order of sweet potato fries. Any one else always want fries with their salad?!  The salad was delicious! I loved the saltiness of the olives and butter beans, paired with the softness of the pita and crunch of the red onion. The shrimp was super flavorful and cooked perfectly. The fries were good too! I was very satisfied. I even came back a week later and got the exact same order. I could eat this salad everyday seriously.  My hubby got the crab cake sandwich and sweet potato fries. He ate the entire thing and really enjoyed it as well stating he would definitely come back. Pricing is reasonable and service was timely. Great spot!",

My girlfriend and I went always try somewhere new for our monthly brunch and Windsor was this months choice.    Let me start with the SERVICE. From the minute we walked in we genuinely felt welcomed.  This was our first time here but it felt like everyone knew our names :-)  The DRINKS!!!! Ok other than the great drink specials which are reason enough to visit....we tried 5 different cocktails and all of them were delicious. If I had to pick a favorite it would be the one with the strawberry (see menu photo.    Our FOOD was the best part!!! I'm already planning my next out just to try more stuff from the menu.  I haven't had fried okra in years so I was so surprised and excited when i saw it in the menu.  It was deli and any friend okra lovers know it has to be cooked just right and it was!  We LOVED our waiter (shout out to Benny).  He was just great at his job,  making great drink suggestions, telling us the best stuff in the menu, having great conversation & jokes with us that he almost made us late of our 2:30 commitment.  We really could have stayed all day.    We will beck back and if you have never been to Windsor, wait no longer! You won't regret it!",

Well just like a good Girl Scout, I was prepared for the worst but luckily experienced the best. It rocked. The mustard sauce, the coleslaw (which normally I scrap off), the bacon....I mean how on earth could they make this any better.  Previous visits I've had the Crabcake BLT (A-mazing), the Burger, Windsor-style, and the Waldorf Salad. All great. Honestly, although this is not exactly a health food stop, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.",

I visited the Windsor at 8:30 on a weeknight and it was surprisingly busy, but there was no wait.  We opted to sit on the patio, which ot my surprise was nicer than the inside dining area. Wooden booths and tables, padded chairs and corrugated metal shade complete the contemporary urban patio  The menu has salad, and various burger like sandwiches on the menu, which on the surface is nothing interesting, the sides list is quite eclectic, there is the traditional fries, and the less traditional,  Kale chips, fried okra, mac & cheese, sweet cabbage salad and more. at $3 each I think 3-4 may be a fun snack meal.   I went with the Halibut Bahn Mi, ($13) Their take on a Vietnamese favorite. S soft round bun housed a perfectly cooked piece of halibut, an assortment of greens, and a flavored mayo. It was spicy, fresh and hearty, I highly recommend this. With any main dish you also have a choice of side. I went with the fried Okra, which was delicious, crispy, not soggy like Okra can easily be, and the batter had a great flavor. It was in perfect bit sized pieces too.  My table also got a salad ($9) with salmon ($3) note the salmon is smoked. This was good but nothing too special.    A small dish of pistachios is delivered to the table as a complimentary app, it is a nice protein packed treat.  The service was also great, I had just finished a spin class and was drinking water faster than a elephant, however my glass never went lower than 1/3, even after 10 refills. This was even more surprising as usually patios are the black hole of service.",

    "text": "Windsor is a solid little date spot in central phoenix at Central & Camelback which you definitely need to take a girl a to. I have been twice now and wanted to share each of my experiences with you.   The first was about 9 months ago, where a lady friend of mine wanted to take me as she lived pretty close to it. We sat in one of the nice leather booths had a couple of cocktails and dinner. All of the patrons were super friendly and everyone kind of feels that because we all know and love this place, we should be awesome to each other. I love businesses that attract these types of people. Dinner was solid, I had a chicken sandwich sans the bun and garden veggies. I knew I would be back.  The second time was for a friends birthday dinner where we took a group of about 10. They surprisingly had room for us and nestled on nice leather couch towards the back. The cocktails again, maybe overpriced, but my Lawd they're delicious. They also have a great price for 3/4 pitchers of beer, so if you're a beer drinker, you're in good hands.   This time I had the PicNic Skewers, which is essentially one skewer of steak, chicken, shrimp, and veggies, served with an amazing mustard sauce and tamitillo salsa. Delicious!  The vibe: On the floor on the left side of the restaurant you will see, \"You Should\" and on the right side, if you pay attention will see \"Question Authority\". I love this. Thousands of patrons will come and go and never see this hidden gem of their decor.   The hallway to the restroom is lined with old cassette tapes, giving a great backdrop to a cute little date selfie.   Around the corner from the restaurants is the cutest dessert store ever! Technically, its separate but its not. Its part of the experience. End your date (especially daddy / daughter dates) for the perfect end to a great evening out.   Bottom line: You'll love Windsor!",

    "text": "Really Phoenix? This is some of the best you got?  Meh. MEH. I'm grumpy cat all over this place.  First of all, the valet situation was poor. I understand that the valets want to control traffic flow during busy hours, but when it's not busy, making me turn around and pull back around front is ridiculous.  Then, to refuse to park my car is flat out dumb. Another reason why I dislike valets and restaurants that use them when there's not a direct need.  So at least my husband got a nice, breezy table outside on the patio while I parked. I'll give them points for atmosphere, but alot of the credit must go to the amazing Arizona spring weather. We started off with the fondue, our usual when out in Arizona, where it oddly is served everywhere. The pretzel was warm and freshly baked, but you'll notice I'm complimenting the dipper, not the dip. The fondue, while creamy, also had the distinctive cornstarch note known to appease all lovers of cheese fondue. MEH. For dinner, I tried out the country vegetable chop. All of the veggies (corn, peas, okra, asparagus, kale, carrots, radishes) were all fresh and light. The homemade buttermilk dressing was remarkably light. Delicious all around, but not enough to to appease me after the random valet issues, mediocre service, and poorly done cheese fondue.",

I was seated quickly and a waiter came to ask for my drink order as soon as I sat down which didn't give me enough time to look at the drinks menu. I ordered a green Bloody Mary which they claim to be famous for but it was gross ( maybe it's an acquired taste). I ordered eggs Benedict with ham and some roasted potatoes. The eggs themselves were nasty. The hollandaise sauce was more of a tangy mayo with egg than what it's suppose to be. The potatoes were too salty and dry. Getting my servers attention was a real chore and I had to ask separate wait staff to help me close my check. Definitely do not recommend!",

Actually everything we tried was delish. Cocktails, starters, dinners, and ice cream dessert. We shared the mini corn-dogs (yum) and the roulette of roasted peppers (surprisingly yum) pre-dinner. Everybody ordered something different and all was quite good - pork sandwich, tuna tartare, ahi tuna salad, white fish sandwich, and the short ribs - I would have any one of them again. As said before, service was excellent and the place has great music playing with a hip wall to check out as you enter the restroom area. Be forewarned though - the parking lot is TINY.",

They are frequently out of their specialty drinks, which are usually stuffed with ice and fairly weak. The food is good, but it's not nearly as good as you'd expect for the price and hype. As one example, the ahi tuna salad is sad for the price. Perhaps my perception will change and I've just gone on off nights. Either way, 3 stars for being out of most do your speciality drinks the last few nights I went. I agree with other reviewers that the wait staff could be nicer, especially the bartenders.",

The patio is fantastic and I look forward to enjoying a cocktail or two out there once the heat subsides.  All of the staff we encountered were extremely friendly.  Shortly after I put my name in for a table, a gentleman brought me an unsolicited glass of ice water.  I love little touches like that!    It is a bit loud inside but it seemed to quiet down a bit after the initial dinner rush.  I had the fatoosh salad which was delightful.  I added the grilled chicken which was cooked and seasoned wonderfully.    A few other reviews complained about the music but I rather enjoyed the eclectic mix.  Nothing like being mid-bite and suddenly remembering high school.    The other reviewers are correct - just do the complimentary valet.  The parking lot is wonky and it's so much easier to part with a same tip.  I should note the valets were also extremely friendly.    All in all, a great experience and I can't wait to go back.",

Both of us found our food to be delicious and the service was fast and attentive.   I want to go back again and try the ceviche and some of the specialty cocktails. I can definitely see hanging out at this place when I am home in Phoenix.",

I've ventured into nearly all of the menu by now, and all of the items I want to try. When there's a lot of different things on the menu that interest my tummy, that's a good thing. Don't lose that part of you.  What's my favorite so far? Probably the fondue for an appetizer and the windsor burger (no tomato) and church potatoes for dinner. That seems to be the popular choice I make 80% of the time.  So.  What about the other 20%? BRUNCH BITCHES. Yes. There's brunch now as if this place couldn't get any better. Lovely, delicious, amazing brunch. Brunch with $5 pitchers of drinks. Brunches with some of the best biscuits I've ever had with my biscuits and gravy. Brunches that left the large group of people I came with amazed and full.   The service is usually right on point. The food is always incredible. The decor I cannot seem to get enough of, and even though I am not a fan of having to valet, you make it complimentary. And the valet people are pretty cool. Is it sad that I'm nearly on a first name basis with them as well?  I beg you to stay, Windsor. And challenge you to deliver brunch to my house.",

I also got to sample the pancakes with strawberries and mascarpone and it was tasty but I thought the pancake was a little on the spongy side.

Try sitting at the bar to do a little mingling (if you're so inclined).  We tried a couple of different cocktails, which were both simply fantastic.  Further, we tried a mixed grain salad, which was simply fantastic.  It was perfectly balanced and the orange basil vinaigrette was PERFECT.  If only all healthier cuisine tasted that damn good!

Overall our group of about fifteen people was happy with their lunches, .The menu is varied and interesting, not run of the mill fare. Many expressed a desire to return to Windsor and try some other dishes.  Our server did a  good job, although plates were served in a staggered manner, a kitchen problem probably. At our table a friend had to wait 15  minutes after the rest of us were served, and at another table a friend was not served at all. Waiter made it right and comped his meal (no charge).  My Fatoush salad was pretty good, it was the only salad without kale. Suggest it be served with pita bread on the side not as croutons. A friends hummus appetizer was very tasty but more veggies would make it better.  After the meal we popped into Churn next door for an ice cream cone, the Vietnamese coffee flavor was delicious. Even the cone tasted special, not the usual cones served everywhere else. We enjoyed sitting in the rear at their pleasant shaded patio.  Later learned that Churn and Windsor have the same owner.",

They have a great patio and happy hour special. The ambience of this place is very relaxing and welcoming. It is a perfect place to come after work with friends or co-workers to grab a beer and chill. They have plenty of beers and mixed drinks to choose from and menu options.  I started with an order of the Russian Roulettes. The menu description reads, \"Seasonal peppers sauteed in lemon & olive oil. Some are hot & some are not!\" My table loved the appetizer. Delicious peppers with just the right about of seasoning and spice. The rest of the menu consists of sandwiches and burgers. I had The Berkeley black bean burger and it was great.

You won't look good eating it, but it's freaking good.  Order the fondue appetizer. It's worth it. I usually pass on dessert since they share a wall with Churn.

When you enter this place it just automatically makes you feel like one of those trendy, hot, hipster people... I was just a regular asian chick before I walked in.  As soon as I entered, I was one cool cat.  Hahahha, obviously I don't sound like one.   This would be a great place for date night.  If I lived in Arizona...this would definitely be a spot of mines.   Broccoli cheddar soup was thick and full of flavor.  Chop salad was perfect with kale, avocado, and fried okra!  Service is nice and goddamn!  The staff has the sickest sense of style.  It's like they all walked out of a fashion show.   Bonus: their wall made of cassette tapes.  Love.",

The inside of the restaurant was cozy and I really liked the cassette wall display. We made it for happy hour so all pitchers and drinks were $5. You can't beat that!  I ordered the Bahn Mi halibut sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese & my boyfriend ordered the Crab Cake BLT with a side of their Jo's Church potatoes. Both dishes were amazing and the sides were just as good. I would defiantly recommend the Jo's church potatoes. It tastes like Cracker Barrels hash town casserole but better. My friends got the Porkwich sandwich and Bacon Cheese burger. The pork on the sandwich was juicy with lots of flavor and the sandwich just melted in your mouth. Overall the food and drinks were great and the staff was friendly. Our server made sure our drinks were full every time and I liked that we didn't have to ask for refills. I would defiantly recommend this place and we will be back again.",

The shrimp was the best part, the pork was dry and chewy, the chicken just ok.  The mac and cheese, good not great.  The Jo's Church potatoes were not as good as expected based on the pics I saw.  Overall, this place was just ok and way over priced.  I don't have interest in going back here.",

Honestly, I am not sure what I love the most. I have been there three times now, from a weekday to a Happy Hour and I haven't had any issue with parking.  The wait for a seat was minimal, and the patio was inviting as the bar was fun, and the tables are sooo cozy.    The cocktails are GREAT. I am addicted to the one with Ginger, but I can't remember the name of it.  I love the wine being on tap, it's eco-delicious.  I enjoy the company of everyone at the restaurant and I seem to see people I know there most often. The bartenders are a delight, they introduce themselves and talk a lot about the menu and choices, etc.  Even the owner/manager person (whoever she was) came by and asked what we thought of the meals, drinks, atmosphere, etc.    I also love the wall of tapes, and watching families bike in and get ice cream and sit in the floral decor of the comfortable patio with cute kids...very inviting. I could see bringing a date here (alas I am married now, so my date is my hubby), but I would also bring my parents and my son here.    I loved the Halibut, the Kale Salad, the snacks, the Sausage Sandwich and I can't wait to go again and try more.  With the closing of Bomberos/Verde/My Florist, the burning of Richardsons,  the crowds at Postino, the valet only at the Vig, the lack of fresh salads at the Garage, cold (warm) food at Local Breeze and the disappointing service at Arrogant Butcher - this place moved quickly up to a top choice for dinner and drinks.  Move over Hula's, SENS, Hanny's, TMI, Rokerij and CIBO! :-)",

Food coming out wrong often, buns dry to the point they taste like a 7 day old croissaint... a bartender once asked me \"what do you want me to do\" after we got food we did not order... I used to come here a lot, but I think there are many other restaurants to visit in the area instead unfortunately.",

We had a 20 or so min wait so we grabbed a couple beers at the bar.  Score! $7.50 for 2 pints of Stella. I don't think we've had a beer that cheap since our college days.  The bartenders were really nice as was the hostess.  We were seated outside which is a very nice patio with misters.  They had a great playlist of background music which added to the candlelit ambience.  I wasn't too hungry so ordered the ceviche for my entree and my husband had the windsor burger with roasted veggies.  Omg. Those roasted veggies were da bomd! I was upset because I usually pick fries off of his plate....but these veggies were exceptionally tasty.  The ceviche was okay.  His burger was cooked perfectly and prob one of the best burgers in phoenix so far (more so than vinburger, smashburger).  Being this place is fairly close to home with a great ambience, fair priced drinks and good food, we will definitley be back!",

We ordered the Mixed Grain Salad and the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich with a side of Kale Salad and then split everything. On my own I wouldn't have ordered the sandwich probably, but it was very good. I especially liked the Kale Salad - terrific. The Mixed Grain Salad was very good, my friend liked it better than I. I'm not a big fan of beets - she is.   Service was great - both James and Jamie. Service was friendly, prompt and efficient. My water got refilled quickly and cheerfully - I'm a big drinker.   The atmosphere is pretty hip - too hip for me, but I just ignored that. The music was rather loud. Not sure if there had been more people there if that would have drowned out some of the loudness or just added to it.   Definitely plan to go back. Mid-afternoon is a good time to go.",

He asked if I want to go eat at Windsor.  I had never been to Windsor and, of course I complained because I didn't think they were going to give me enough food to fill me up.  Remember, I am a fatboy trapped in a skinny mans body.  He promised I wouldn't be disappointed.  As we pulled up to Windsor, my first impression as we walked in the door was WOW.  I feel in love with the way the place was set up.  As we sat down, a friendly waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order.  She brought the drinks but she never brought the appetizers.  Then she came back and took our order.  She brought out our food but never brought out the appetizers.  We asked about the appetizers and she said she was so sorry and brought over her manager.  The manager told us she was sorry for the mishap and would comp our bill $17.00 since they forgot to put in our appetizers.  I couldn't believe this place.  It was like heaven.  Needless to say, my meal left me full and satisfied.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was wonderful, and the staff was amazing.  I think I have found my new spot every Sunday afternoon after church.",

I've also had the Fried Chicken and it is excellent as well.  This place has a great vibe going on and when the weather permits, the outside seating is a must.  I guess it doesn't hurt that they have Churn right next door too (Ice Cream shop).  Every first timer must have the deviled egg dip; it's a right of passage.

We also got the corn dog poppers, they were ok, I wish the breading was more dense like the breading at the fair. We also got the chips, pretty dang tasty oh and also the kabobs which were good, nothing amazing but not terrible either.   Next up the food. A friend and I decided to split two items so we could taste test. I got the pulled pork sandwich and he got the burger with the caramelized onions. Both were great though I favor the burger over the pork.   We also had 5 pitchers of STELLA!!!! Stella on tap is pretty rare! So excited about that!   we will for sure be going back to Windsor!",

Check out the pretzel fondue, and the Joe's church potatoes.  Bloody Mary bar for weekend brunch is pretty great too.  Plus, it's next to Churn for your sweet tooth.",

Excellent value and I love that happy hour of $5 for ALL cocktails, Wine by the Glass and a Pitcher of Draft Beer, everyday before 5pm.  What a deal!  If you like martinis, you will love the No17 Cucumber Vodka, with fresh Cucumber & Mint, and Green Tea Syrup.  Very refreshing and great tasting.  Yum!!!!!!!  Will keep going back for more.  Manny,  the Bar Tender is excellent!!!",

Both had amazing flavor and the atmosphere of was fun and accepting  to anyone and everyone. I recommend everyone to try it here! And ask for Sammy!!!!",

After sitting down the waitress came over and asked \"are you ok with water?\" as if she hoped we didn't order.  The bartender brought our drinks and took our order and was slightly more pleasant.  Someone else delivered our food by dropping the plates in front of us and left so quickly you'd think the place was on fire.  She didn't ask if we needed anything else or if we needed more drinks.  We didn't see anyone until we were done eating (and our drinks were dry) when the waitress ran by and dropped the check off on the table.  The atmosphere was the only thing worth going back for.",

Windsor should take a lesson from Switch regarding the background music...love the place and will try again but if the music is as 'heavy and loud', I will make the 'Switch'  and my guests the place for lunch!

I did not like the fact that the hostess attempted to seat my companion and I all the way in the back of the restaurant, passing up several unserved tables. Nope, not on my watch. We split the fish sandwich and a chicken sandwich. I really really liked the fish sandwich. The flavors were layered and intense. The chopped kale salad was a nice alternative to a traditional garden salad. The chicken sandwich was a little bland. Our waitress was on top of it, I think her name was Lisa. I was not loving the flies buzzing around while we ate, but what can ya do.",

She never checked back or ask if we needed refills.  In fact I had to ask for a refill of tea and she never responded like \"Sure\" walked away to get our check brought the check back with no refill.  5 minutes later a busser brought the refill.  She was not engaging and never smiled actually came off as having a chip on her shoulder.  We frequent Windsors, Postinos, Federal pizza , and Joy Ride and have never had the experience we did today.   I say if you don't like your job perhaps you should consider a different one.

    "text": "I met a friend for happy hour here earlier in the week.  We sat on the patio, which was really nice.  Along with some wine and beer, we shared the fondue.  Very yummy--particularly the pretzel pieces.  But then again, I love anything smothered in cheese sauce.  We didn't try anything else on the menu, but everything going by looked tasty.  The only reason for one fewer star than I would normally give is the parking situation.  It's bad, particularly if you come earlier than 6 pm.  Valet parking/the regular lot was full, so I was directed to park on the residential street behind the restaurant.  There were already about 30 cars parked on the street, and let's just say it's clear the neighbors are hostile about having their once- quiet street turned into a parking lot.  There are garbage cans along the curbs with signs that make it clear that they don't want you parking in front of their houses, and frankly, I don't blame them.  When I parked and got out, one of the homeowners confronted me verbally (while holding a hose and spraying water).  Again, I'm symphathetic.  I wouldn't want a bunch of people driving through my quiet neighborhood, but I also didn't want the smack talk I got after parking.  The Windsor/Churn owners need to resolve this problem before it gets uglier than being threatened with a spray of water.",

The hamburger I had was good, not great.  Did enjoy the fried okra, but found the mac and cheese dry and tasteless.   The wait staff was nonchalant and seemed to be more interested in each other than in waiting on tables.  Also, my daughter and her friends went there for a late dinner (they are all 24-26 years old).  They were carded but the waitress didn't believe them.  She sent the manager over who actually sat down at the table and had them each produce three more cards, which I thought was above and beyond.  After they had emptied their wallets, they did get their drinks, but the waitress, having been shown up, was rude to the girls after that.  It is a shame that this group of young women, who are all med students and law students, were subjected to this treatment and all have vowed never to return.",

Yes it's got a great vibe and all the cool hip people seem to be gathering there---at least for now. However, waiting 45 minutes for a table at 7? Ok fine, it is Friday afterall so I'll head off to the bar for a nice martini while I wait for a table and my friends. Surprisingly again, it was the WORST martini I've ever had: slightly cold at best and heating up on the 3rd sip. It was basically a semi cold cup of vodka w/ some washed out olive juice. I had to ask a bartender for a cup of ice to get it cold again--- yikes. When my friends met me they ordered wine and the pour was noticeably less than appropriate. Hmmm.... Dinner was ok, service was ok but it did seem like we were doing them a favor. At the end of dinner, a couple of us stayed to have a 3rd glass of wine and couldn't get any one to help us until we flagged down someone who seemed to be in a managerial position. He again gave us a distinct attitude of condescending benevolence to the point that, when he left our table, we all broke out in laughter. I don't know....it seems to me that the saving grace of this place is the crowd that's going there. I wonder how long will that last with the trickle down attitude and message that we were all privileged to receive?",

All the sandwiches had delicious and fresh ingredients. I got the porkwich, and that one would say doesn't sound too delicious but i was craving some pulled pork. The pulled pork + ham + sweet honey sauce/gravy they put ontop was so complimentary to each other. It was like going to a concert and hearing an awesome 3 part harmony on your tongue! Then the texture of the fresh coldslaw (which still had crunch) just was the high point.   Mac'n Cheese (MnC)...yess please! that was my side. It was baked...thats the way to go, had good texture with some crunch on top (yes i do like texture). The cheese didn't over power. It was a nice clean mac'n cheese, not sloppy and soaked with cheese. It was a good balance, and very light for being a MnC.  The backyard burger...get it..  the whitefish sandwich...get it.  brown bag chicken sandwich...get it..  Other chicken sandwich...get it..  Rueben....not as good as the others, BUT i loved how the meat was soo smokey that it makes up for it.... get it, but its not like that standard rueben you'd get from a deli, so just know that and don't go in with deli standards.  all in all. I love it and i'd come back..",

My mom and I decided to try out a new joint for my birthday lunch and I found this place via my Yelp iPhone application (win!). This place is located on Central and Oregon (small side street) that we missed on our first attempt, but thanks to the Circle K reference sign, we found our way into the parking lot and found a spot without needing to use valet.   We ordered an iced tea while we looked at the menu and decided we were going to start with the Cheddar Foundue, I was going to have the Mixed Grain Salad and my mom was going to have the Crab Cake BLT. Our waitress brought back our iced tea, we places our ordered, and then sipped our iced that turned out to be super tastey and was garnished with an orange. We were already off to a good start!  The cheddar fondue came out next with the tea light candle heat keeping the, generous  portioned, cheddar cheese nice a creamy to dip our sausage, apple slices, and delicious scrumptious pretzel bread. Anyone that comes here needs to order this app! The Mixed Grain Salad and the Crab Cake BLT were both equally as enjoyable. The sandwich came with three small crabcakes ontop of a toasted hoagie roll. We chose the roasted veggies, that were doused in oil, but that's want made is so scrumptious! The mixed grain salad was also scrumptious....but on the more healthier side! :)  The restaurant  is decorated in super cute retro style and there is a very large patio, with misters, to enjoy lunch/dinner/happy hour on. From beginning to end, our food (and drink) experiences were amazing and we will both be back really, really, seriously, really, soon!!!",

It came with sausage, pretzel rolls, and 2 kinds of apples. Try this cheese! We had the hummus plate as well and it was also very good. We shared a Ruben which was so great. A nice pile of pastrami and a whole grain mustard and sourkraut to boot on a marble rye roll. Fries were cooked great and came out nice and hot....which we proceeded to dip in the cheese. Yum! The hummus was creamy and came with unusual veggies for hummus like radishes and snap peas and more. Totally worked. The greek yogurt sauce had a smokey flavor to it. Very good. Friends had the church potatoes and some mac n cheese that they both scarfed down so Im assuming they were great as well. I had a cucumber drink that sounded weird but was actually delicious. Other friends had a different drink with blueberries blackberries and lemonade. Both very refreshing but I thought they were kinda pricey. Service was ok. She seemed nice but not real friendly. She seemed to just drop stuff and pick stuff up. No personality. She filled my ICED T with no ice in it. Iced being the operative word here. In the end, She was nice and we had everything we needed. Im already planning a trip back.",

I am typically no pork fan, but I ordered a pulled pork sandwich (with bacon and ham on it) and my boyfriend ordered the ribs...every bite was splendiferous for both of us. Mac and cheese, church potatoes, chicken tortilla soup...all incredible. Perfect.  The decor is simple, clean, slightly industrial and cute. Very downtowny.  There was also a good mix of clientele and staff.  And you know when there's a good mix of customers, they are there because the food is good not because of 'the scene'.   House music is a slightly odd mix of things (Flaming Lips then Evanescence?) but pretty good. Seating was immensely comfortable and spacious. (pro tip: sit in a booth or against the wall, you will sink right in)  Drink specials are off the hook. A $5 pitcher of Four Peaks Kiltlifter?  I don't think you can even get that at the brewery itself! Wonderful.  But seriously, the food here can best be described as \"American comfort food\" at it's finest. The portions aren't obscene, but nor are they lacking in any way.   I left stuffed, satisfied, and beyond pleased with every facet of my experience here. And with a little left over.  Also, valet parking is free since the parking lot is so tiny and weird to navigate. I highly suggest you take them up on it and don't forget to tip :)",

I really love everything about Windsor, namely their ceviche. It has knocked LGOs off the top of my list. I love to go (when its cooler) and sit on the patio for their $5 pitchers. (daily before 5pm).  I just wish I lived closer :-0 Keep it up, Windsor!",

Not only was the food great as I had the oyster po boy (highly recommend) but the service was perfect.  My sisters brown bag chicken sandwich had so much flavor and was not overwhelmed. The prices range between 9 to 15 dollars for a meal which I thought was just right for the food. Our server was such a nice guy and took care of any need prior to me asking and the place was full too.",

I've been here a couple times and it's always been fine, the only thing that kind of bothered me about my last visit was the woman who took over bar-tending / serving us was a little snooty.  I actually thought she might be a manager of some sort, except for the fact that she seemed so put off by having to bother with us.  (I think I may have even caught her rolling her eyes at us..?  Which was strange because we were pretty much minding our own business and just talking / laughing / catching up normally, not being loud or obnoxious in any way.)  If I do go back at some point, I'll make sure to be seated in an area other than hers.",

    "text": "I recently stumbled in here in the midst of a cross country road trip with my trusty lady sidekick.  We didn't have high hopes for the quality of food in Phoenix but we were pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is fairly LA hipster and it had a gorgeous patio to enjoy the lovely desert weather.  I ventured to order the burger with moderate expectations.  I mean I come from the land of Umami and the Oinkster- how could Phoenix have anything on that!?!  Well their bacon cheeseburger definitely made me a believer.  The sauce was excellent and more importantly the burger was cooked to perfection.  To think ordering medium and actually getting a nice slightly bloody burger? Who would have thought.  My companion ordered the ribs and loved them.  The best part of this spot you ask?  A fairly well developed whiskey/scotch/bourbon list.  Being ladies of discerning taste there are few things we love more after a long day that a whiskey- neat.    If I happen to find myself back in Phoenix you can guarantee I will be here posted up with a burger and a glass of Macallum 12 yr.",

Then we sit inside to eat and we get 4 different waiters the last that was helping us kept coming to take plates away and it was just weird. Then when we were done we got the check as a whole because 2 ppl switched chairs me she stated they wouldn't be able to split since we were playing musical chairs. I don't know why she wouldn't just ask us what we got then and go get checks she didn't she brought us the check for 8 ppl and we had to sit there and seperate each thing. Their food was great but not their service it was horrible and we kept getting random drinks wedding order as well.  So disappointed in the service we were provided we prob won't be coming back.",

Brunch: love their use of Shriner's sausage. Biscuits n gravy is money. Drinking specials a nice treat if you're getting the day started early.  Happy hour specials among the best in town with $5 pitcha's.  Arguably the best burger in town. Love the Windsor burger with the Kale salad- and I don't like Kale salads. Crab Cake BLT is decadent.   Mixed drinks are tight and consistent. Staff works hard.  It's my date spot, a HH fav, random Wed night dinner and after-church-brunch.",

My crab cake BLT wasn't very crabby nor did it have the crunch I had hoped. Maybe breading it in panko would be a better idea. There was too much bread, so I ended up just eating the crab cake. The mac was solid, and the heirloom tomato salad was refreshing with the mint.  The bartenders were great and service was superb. Definitely stop by the ice cream shop behind the kitchen for some fun toys and awesome desserts.",

    "text": "Only been here once and wasn't impressed. But I have loved Postinos for so long I'll give them another shot someday. I was so excited to order the deviled egg dip but was sadly disappointed when I had it. It was pretty much finely chopped egg whites, almost the consistency of large curd cottage cheese. There was no paprika that I could taste, no yolk, or any spice at all like maybe pepper or tabasco. The chips that came with it were mediocre, seemed like store bought kettle chips. For dinner I had the short ribs with chorizo. Again a let down. The first bite was nice but the spice of the chorizo never got off the ground, didn't build into any kind of heat. Then the short rib on top was just your standard short rib, tender flaky but just kind of a meaty brown au jus taste to it, nothing special. After that we went to the candy/ice cream shop next door. Seemed a little gimmicky but it brought in all the hipster foodie wanna be's. My wife did get something with salted caramel on it that was awesome, otherwise it's just ice cream but I'm not a big dessert fan so don't go by  me. One other note, we seemed to have trouble with our waitress early on attending to our table but once my friend made it clear he wanted to order things faster she was much better.",

We are non-drinkers, so I cannot attest to everyone else's love for the bar vibe, but the FOOD was beyond good. I ordered the Burger, Windsor Style, which was definitely good, but with the side of Mac & Cheese (which by the way is likely one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth). My husband laughed because I ate my entire plate of food (which is something I rarely accomplish). My husband had the pork sandwich which he said was equally just as incredible. Dinner here, then dessert at Churn next door. You can't go wrong! Incredible atmosphere. We'll definitely be back!",

When I found out the owners of Postino's were opening up a new spot I was super excited to try it out. My friend and I decided to check it out this past Monday for lunch and we were not very impressed. We ordered there fondue as an appetizer and it was very dissapointing, the cheese was grainy and cold. They serve it with a heep of barbecue meat, apples, salami, and pretzel bread. I will not order this again! The food was ok, I ordered the ban-mi and my friend had the pulled pork sandwich. We both agreed that both sandwiches were lacking in flavor. The best thing I did have was the side that came with my sandwich which was the fried okra it was delicous. Overall we were dissapointed with this place and will continue to stick with our favorite Postino's.",

I see why! 5.00 drinks till 5:00 EVERYDAY and EVERY Cocktail! Pretty good deal! Seating was pretty open we sat on the patio. Service was great! I had 2 glasses of my Sav Blan Wine so I was happy! We started with The Cheddar Fondue, I wanted the Deviled Egg Dip and Chips so next time! It was OK... nothing I would order again, over priced for what they give you. Some cut up apples, sausage, and bread! The bread was the best part, the cheese was luke warm and not great, this whole Fondue thing is so 2012! Not worth your calories! Now the Porkwich I ordered was worth the calories! The pork was tender and hearty! Now think HAM AND BACON added to it! I had the sauce on the side like I always order my sauces, and it was just wonderful! The combo of honey mustard and whatever they put into it was all working its flavors in my mouth!! VERY GOOD! My sister in law and brother both ordered the burger, I don't eat red meat but if I ever decide to go back I am heading here for a Windsor burger! It looked so good! The fries are good as well, thin sliced and the Cole Slaw was great! I just love the music they play as well in this joint! Of course you must check out all the old tapes hanging on the wall! I was excited I found George Michael! :)",

The real cassette tape wall that leads to the bathrooms, the bathrooms with subway tiles, the flannel material on the chairs, the waiters all in flannel shirts,you get the idea. While the hipster atmosphere is a little much, Windsor does get serious when it comes to their menu. I had the chicken sandwich with a mango salsa and the macaroni and cheese as a side. Food was great, service was hit or miss. My dining companion ordered a tea which the waitress confirmed upon request and then she never brought it. Requested again and it was brought about 10 mins later. Was a late lunch and the service should not have been so flaky for such a down time. I would go back, just hope for better service and their menu did leave me wanting to try more things.",

Also, I hate having to valet my car, but I'll accept that as the price to pay for having cool venues like this pop up in random, interesting neighborhoods throughout Phoenix (much like the original Postino in Arcadia). There's no space for parking, so whaddya gonna do? Light rail is blocks away so that's only walkable in the winter.",

    "text": "As an NCP local, living walking distance from the Upward Projects, you could say I've been to Windsor a time or two. When I went to dinner last night with my family, I was reminded once again, why our neighborhood is so lucky to have Windsor. When we were seated, we were concerned our waiter was in a bad mood, slightly regretful we were seated in his section. It turned out he was just quiet with an incredibly dry (and hilarious) sense of humor, as he redeemed himself when my dad spilled an entire glass of red wine all over his pants. His quick interjections made the whole thing laughable. The incident suggested a change to white wine, as it is much more \"summery\" and he wouldn't run the risk of another pant-staining mishap. My parents wanted to order a bottle, which I was totally against, considering the fact that I've never ever found a white wine I liked and my mom's tastes veer toward the terribly sweet picks. Don't ask me how he did it, but he magically found a bottle all three of us enjoyed!   When it came time to order, he accidentally rang up my dad's pot pie as the fish, apologizing like crazy when he realized his mistake. He proceeded to let us know he'd comp the pot pie and make it up to us. I mean, apologies were expected but considering his food came out not even five minutes late, the comp was totally unnecessary but greatly appreciated! When we received our check, our waiter brought out a large handful of coupons for free ice cream from Churn next door - a sweet way to end our delicious meal and enough ice cream to last a week. A night of superb service, mixed with witty banter from a surprisingly passionate waiter and phenomenal food made me fall in love with Windsor all over again! Oh and we even sat comfortably outside on the patio. Anyone who can pull of an enjoyable patio experience in the middle of summer deserves serious props.",

I've only had one appetizer there, the loaded chips, and they were great-tasting at first, but were a little ambitious with the ingredients--definitely overpowering. There were a few menu items I wanted to try, but on second glance, they also look a little too ambitious, so I have a feeling the taste is going to be too rich. (I cannot eat everything I like as I get older...major bummer!)  The ambience is a happy medium between a place to chill with friends or have a dinner date.

We sat on the patio even though it was 100 plus degrees outside, the misters and shade kept us comfortable, but for those who can't handle the heat, the wait for inside was only about 15 mins. We used the complimentary valet as parking is scarce, and hey, it was free and worth the $5 tip for the convenience.   I ordered the no. 2 drink (basically a Peach Bellini) and the simple life breakfast (2 eggs, homemade English muffin, fruit, and pork belly bacon). Both were perfect and delicious! The BFF ordered the Matador (Two eggs over easy stacked with griddled cheddar potatoes, a crispy tortilla, salsa verde & avocado relish) which she also said was super yummy.   We also had the No. 91 (Prosecco, House Blackberry Puree, Creme de Mure) and another fruit heaven concoction I don't recall the no. of.   The service was stellar, quick and polite. The drinks were sweet and tangy, cold, and refreshing. During brunch, only $5 bucks. Whoa!  They also have a good looking bloody mary bar which we didn't try but can't imagine could be bad!  I would recommend this place to anyone who will listen (or read). The prices are great for brunch. A must visit in Phoenix!",

Also had the bacon cheeseburger and mac & cheese (both pretty good). Couples next to us ordered a sampler platter of some sort with shrimp - they both raved about it, as well as the custom style drinks.  $5 for a small(er) pitcher of good beers on Sundays - great deal. Lots of unique drinks, worth a try. Servers would awesome with recommendations and making their unique drinks.",

The wait staff was kind and patient and worked with me to provide a delicious meal. I ended up with a plain grilled white fish with their sweet potato fries. Our wait person made sure to follow up with me and made sure everything was good. I appreciated being treated with respect and not like someone who is a nusiance, which has happened at other restaurants. I now know I can go and eat there and have an enjoyable experience. Thank you Windsor!",

    "text": "I've been to Windsor enough now to \"get it\" and to have let them address some of the observations of other customers.   I'll start off by saying that there is nothing fatally flawed in the place, and the concept is quite good. Combined with Churn and DeMarco's I consider it a hipster urbanist interpretation of a  shopping mall food court for the 30-50 demographic. Everything in it speaks in some way to those who were in high school or college in the mid-eighties through mid-nineties. Let me take a moment to gloat: My BROTHERS AND SISTERS! WE ARE IN THE RICH PART OF THE NOSTALGIA CURVE NOW! ENJOY! Anyway, the concept and decor is great and just works.  What's wrong? Well, the food. Everything I have ordered off the appetizer menu is either too salty or not quite there in some way. Portion was too small or was over/underdone. I don't mind the fact that they don't really have any happy hour specials to excite and entice, but  if there's no discount to convince me that I am somehow getting a deal, the food better be terrific. And it isn't. The groups I've been with have left half portions of small plates that should have been wiped clean.  What else? The service was noticeably slow and a bit cold each time I was there. Yes, I get it: You're young, attractive and hip and are probably working on a screenplay that will sensitize all of us to the ecological plight of the pygmy eskimo wombat, and working this mind-numblingly-dull waiter job is such a condescension. Just bring me a beer.  Also, the music is too loud. I didn't like most of that stuff the first time around, but I'll indulge it for nostalgia's sake.   Anyway, not bad but not quite a destination. Needs some work.",

Winner!\"  I had the MOST attentive service from our greeting at the door, to our seating in back, to our beverage service...ooops, then a small lapse in service...no biggie I was enjoying the vibe and the ambience.  Ordered the Double Dip...sadly the name reminded me of my buddies in college when they would chew tobacco, sometimes they would \"double dip\"....gross I know. The concept of this dip is a cobb salad made into a dip served with a chipotle salsa (didn't get much smoky chipotle flavor however...which is fine since my little petite self is sensitive to spicy food...I mean my mom would serve potato chips and ketchup and called it chips and salsa...but I digress). I would order the dip again, but I have to say it really tasted just like egg salad. And fortunately I loves me some egg salad!  My rueben sandwich was OUTSTANDING and I chose a side of mac n cheese which was total bliss (NOT plugging a restaurant downtown btw)....that was the word I said as cheese and a chunk of elbow macaroni slid down my chin. Pleasant, I know. My friend was doing the Meg Ryan orgasm scene as he enjoyed his bbq pulled chicken sandwich.   I'm sure we looked ridiculous. But we were ridiculously happy.   Welcome to the neighborhood Windsor. Let's totally hang out more often!",

The pretzels were pretty good, not sure about apples with cheddar, and the sausage was cold and weird tasting...  My friend got the crab cake blt sandwich.  It was a bit greasy.  The fries were almost limp and not salted enough.  The 2 drinks we tried were not the best.  The bitter orange(?) one was actually decent, but wouldn't recommend if you don't like bitter orange.  It muted the alcohol taste which might also be a benefit.  All in all, I won't drag my feet if my friends want to come here again but I probably won't suggest it.",

    "text": "I came here last night with two of my friends for dinner and had a wonderful time.  The menu itself is outstanding, and the food was utterly delicious.  I went with the backyard burger, and it was delicious!  One of my other friends went with the New Orleans ribs and the other one went with the backyard burger like me.  The menu here seems to be pretty solid, and I've heard that there isn't a bad dish to get here, and I believe it.  The service was outstanding, and I really liked how attentive they were with us.  Since we were there during happy hour on the weekend, we all split a pitcher for $5, and it was tasty. I considered having a hard liquor drink, but I figured the beer would have been better.  Am I glad I did!  Definitely a Phoenix gem, and should be on everyone's short list of places to eat at when it town visiting!  Or, if you live here, go more often then I did! (which was never because I never really had the time.) I wish I had come here sooner.  Definitely a bit of a hipster place, but fun to not only people watch, but the food is awesome as well.  Don't get me wrong, there's regular people in here as well, but it's fun to see some of the hipsters stroll in and out from time to time.  Parking is easy since they put in the new lot immediately next door, and it's attached to an ice cream place as well.  the only draw back was the unisex bathrooms.  A line formed, and it's kind of a first come first serve deal. One toilet in each, and I don't know that I liked the idea.  The bathrooms were decorated really cool, so that kind of made it better for me. I just prefer separate bathrooms for men and women, that's all.  Also, I found the volume of the music in here severely annoying.  I thought it was a bit to loud, and felt like I had to talk over it at times.  Plus, the music sucked.  That's my only \"real\" annoyance, and it almost made me feel like I was in the club.  (ok, not close, I know, but nothing sucks more then having to talk over music!!)",

Their beef burger was great also took a few nibbles of a date. Kababs were great and their sweet potato fries was amazing!! Drinks are a little weak & needed an extra shot.. Getting whiskey strightup was a little small also. But at the end the staff took care of us.. They popped into the busy ice cream shop to get us a few cups when their line was SUPER long.. And we didn't wait at all to get served! Their interior decor was real fancy.. Have out a feeling of warm & welcoming to their guest!",

    "text": "I wonder if, given a decade or so, we'll look back at this period of rustic architecture and re-purposing of buildings the way we do avocado-green appliances, shag carpeting and fuzzy wall paper.    Regardless, for today and tomorrow, the atmosphere, service and food at Windsor was terrific.  I loved every minute of my time there.  Hell, even the bathrooms (uni-sex and shared with next-door's Churn were pleasing)!  And I LOVE the cassette tape wall.  If you're anti-hipster, this is not the place for you.  If you dig tasty and cool, stop by soon.  We arrived around 9:30 am on Sunday and the main restaurant held a 15 minute wait, we could have been seated at the bar, but even though it was already a hot morning, seeing a couple groups of young women seating on the patio, we discerned that it couldn't be to bad out there.  We were right!  Fans and misters made it very nice to eat on the patio.  I recommend it.  My daughter ordered the Highroad Sandwich, my gf went with the Crab Cakes Benedict, and I opted for the Matador.  Everyone loved their selections and shared them around the table.  A side of biscuits and gravy was ordered also, and it was full of big chunks of awesome, local sausage.    So if you like chili verde, go with the Matador.  Great take on huevos rancheros, served over Windsor's Griddled Cheddar Potatoes.  My only issue was that the tortilla was pretty stiff and difficult to cut, but the flavors were terrific.    The hollandaise on the benedict was a little cheesy for my tastes, but good and freshly made.  In fact, our server (Alex) informed us that pretty much everything on the menu was made fresh on site and locally sourced - both big issues in my book, and thankfully becoming the norm in the new restaurant revolution.  Unfortunately, price follows the revolution, but in the case of the Windsor, it was worth it.  I'll be back to sample the lunch/dinner menu.  Hope to see you there.",

You know when you haven't eaten all day, everything taste better than it actually is?   Well this was the contrary. The Ahi Poke Plate was saturated in soy sauce. I'm not one to complain to get a free meal and I was pretty darn hungry so I ate the tuna off the top and kept my opinions to leave on yelp. They must have ran out of avacado because the Poke was avocado-less. My 2 year old loves any type or kind of Mac n Cheese and he had 1 bite and wouldn't touch it again. It was dryer than the Phoenix desert. My wife ordered the basic cheeseburger on the menu and ate 2-3 bites and wouldn't touch it again. And my Rueben was nothing to write home about. My wife did however enjoy the funeral potatoes. Ice had melted in tap water before we were seated and water was warm. Water was gross. Waiter disappeared and I had to catch busser to order a coke. I Was never offered a refill on coke, but busser came by and topped off my wife's water one time. Pretty disappointed overall and doubtful that I'll return. Luckily Churn is next door, so I can go cleanse my palette.",

In terms of food, the burgers, sweet potatoes fries, kale salad and corn dog bites were all excellent. They even have us coupons for a free scoop of ice cream for the ice cream shop next door. Amazing Oreo mint flavor. We will be coming back soon.",

Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich was flavorful with a little crunch and kick,my side was the Chopped Kale Salad. Took no food photos cause the place was too cool for all that foodporn!!!",

My friend and I came here for early dinner yesterday and we know how good this place was, we just wanted to go mellow during dinner with a couple of drinks. We both decided to share our meals so we got the Greek God appetizer and the Mixed grain salad. Both dishes were fantastic but the mixed grain salad was out of this world. Amazingly prepared grains with bunch of greens and beer roots, could not have asked for anything better. We also got the fried okra side dish and oh man they were tasty. The drinks were good too. Our server Sara was very attentive and friendly. I would definitely come back to the Windsor and recommend to all to pay a visit.",

Aside from having a boyish charm augmented by his cheeky sense of humor and all around general swagger (that's what kids call it these days, right?) he was pretty much psychic. He somehow knew we were gonna order like 8000 apps and came back with impeccable timing to get yet another dish in for us, never once being annoyed that we didn't just order it all at one time. Then, then, THEEEEEENNNNNN he came over to make sure we got the last fried chicken because, well, he read our minds and knew we were already eyeballing it. Just about the only thing he wasn't helpful on was my indecision with a side. He suggested all three of the sides I was torn over which means he's clearly a man of good taste. Is he my soulmate? Maybe. But I supposed we will never know. And I'm sure a long lasting relationship has to be based on something more than having the same favorite side dishes. But I digress. Brandon is the best. Give him a raise. Jk, lol, we all know that's not a thing in the industry. So just tell him he's a great employee and maybe give him a Saturday night or two off.",

After many numerous tries, I finally got a male voice on the other end with so much noise I could barely hear him.  The call immediately was disconnected. I tried 2 more times with the same result.

Service is \"team oriented,\" so get used to different servers asking to help serve beverages or food. Great service, tho!!  We ordered the cheddar fondue and split the mixed grain salad with Salmon.   Cheddar fondue: Cheese is served in a dish over a flame, and tastes similar to restaurant plain mac and cheese sauce (milky and not too cheddary), both green and red apple slices, sausage is cold/chilled in the center. Pretzel didn't taste original. Okay.  Mixed grain salad with Salmon: Balanced, hearty, and grains gave good texture to the dish. Met expectations.",

The music was fabulous the whole time we were there. What a great time!! We will for sure be back and will be telling all of our friends and family to go visit. We went on a Monday at about 3 PM when they still had their cocktail deal going. We got the deviled egg dip for an appetizer which was to die for! The homemade chips were awesome!!! The soup and salad were just as tasty and the burger and fries (windsor style) were superb!! We saw this restaurant when going to churn ice cream next door a few days ago and once i googled the menu i knew we had to visit! Seriously such an incredible experience. Highly recommend!!",

As always, my need was sausage gravy and biscuits, but alas, I'm not supposed to be eating biscuits.  What is a girl to do?  Ask the server.  He offered up a deconstruction, and I was able to eat my favorite meal and give my biscuits to my sister.  SCORE!  Doesn't hurt that I washed it all down with a Pitcha of Pimms.  This is the BEST place for brunch.  Beyond food, the service is exceptional.  You can't miss this while you're in Phoenix.",

I did not know this combination of ingredients could actually work! Caramelized onions, bacon, blue cheese, and chipotle crema - oh my!  I also ordered a burger, which tasted cheesy with delectable bread, but the loaded chips have seared an imprint on my memory. They have $5 cocktails til 5pm everyday - dangerous because their cocktails taste great. No.17 with the green tea syrup and cucumber mint was especially refreshing. All in all, I want to come back here for brunch!",

I love their drinks! Its cheap and worth it! They have happy hour for 5 dollars drink until 5pm everyday!  The atmosphere here is so nice. Its the perfect place to go out on date or catch up with some friend over cheap drinks! Love it!  Food was excellent!

I noticed that some seating is directly underneath a tree, so be careful 'cause that tree sheds its flowers like a mother. It was raining down petals onto some of its patrons, but they didn't seem to mind. They just nonchalantly placed their napkins over their drinks.  Onto the food...  - Caesar Salad w/ Salmon: dressing was tangy, salmon was well cooked  - Homemade Chips: sooo crunchy and great texture  - Veggie Stack: so bomb diggity! best dish of the day imo  - $5 cocktails? why wouldn't you come here?? (#17 was super refreshing btw)  Overall a great, relaxing brunch outdoors. They even gave our pup a water bowl with ice. It'd make for a reeeal cute, casual date spot.",

Anchoring Churn and a clothing store, Windsor is an ideal place to grab a bite to eat before heading next door for some tasty ice cream, or some serious shopping next to that.   Breakfast here is my favorite on their menu. The offerings are just the right size, both in portions and available options. Not so many menu items that it's overwhelming, and just the right amount of food to fill you up. When the weather is accommodating, their patio is stellar. [Truth be told, even in the summer it's still pretty much a kickass patio]  It also doesn't hurt that Windsor is exactly 7.5 blocks from my home.",

I decided to order the pastrami Reuben which was very good and the cheesy potato side was AMAZING. My fiancee ordered the brown bag chicken sandwich that she really really enjoyed as well.

My backyard burger windsor style was hot and cooked properly. What was missing was savory flavor. Everything was sweet with no balance. The burger itself did not taste to be seasoned and all the accoutrements were sweet including the bun. My wife got the crab cake BLT and it was assembled and cooked fine, but it is just a bad design. It comes on a huge chewy hoagie roll that drowns out any crab or bacon flavor and is virtually impossible for humans to put in their mouths. The chopped kale salad was way too tough to eat. A quick blanche of the kale followed by an ice bath would improve this a great deal. The bartender was knowledgeable and fun. The food was awkward. Really should be 2.5 stars instead of three.",

As for the food, I had the Backyard Burger, Windsor style, and it was the best burger I've had in a while :) super juicy and the sauce they put on it is delicious. I had fries on the side which were great too, and they have really good ranch lol. I'm picky about ranch, and I loved theirs. I also tried their jalapeno cheddar cornbread, and I would recommend that as well!   For drinks I tried the No. 68, which has coconut water in it, so it was a little watery for my taste but still good. My boyfriend tried the No. 39, which was delicious. It has saffron-infused bourbon, and I don't even like bourbon, but I liked that! I'll definitely be going back here soon! :)",

Not sure we will give this place a second chance..too many great places in the nieghborhood that get it right",

How about an apology and comp the food that was not rang in or delivered after 25 minutes of the customer ordering. His attitude was unacceptable and I will NOT be back. For having the display and decor of a fine establishment, the service proved otherwise. Pity because we all just moved nearby- They just lost 3 longterm customers.",

The ambiance is cozy and the food matches the restaurant-bar atmosphere to a \"T.\"   For cocktails, #17 seems to be our party of 14's favorite. I'm not surprised because cucumber vodka with green tea syrup appears to be a unique yet satisfying blend. I stuck with my own routine and ordered an Old Fashioned. It definitely packed a punch here! 'Twas not a bourbon drink for sissies but kicked off the night quite well!  The cheddar fondue appetizer was highly addicting, so I'm glad my friend and I shared this heavenly delight. Onlookers glared with envy, and said \"Now I wish I had ordered the fondue too.\" Screw the carb free diet! The pretzel bread and cheddar are worth the affair! Don't even get me started on the sausage that accompanied this power duo! Pure bliss!  Hello Porkwich! Pulled pork, sliced ham, and bacon join forces to envelop you in pork ecstasy. The coleslaw adds a nice texture and flavor to the meaty goodness of this buttermilk bun packaged treat.",

When we pulled at the door it was locked so we assumed we had missed our chance and through the door we heard the guy say WERE CLOSED ASSHOLE!  It was shocking and rude and even if he did not know we heard him yell it out what would be the cause for him to say it?  We go all the time and bring our money to the establishment and that's what they think of their patrons ?  And just for the record the hours posted on website and Yelp do say from 11 to 11 \"ASSHOLE\"  There are 20 Resteraunt 's in a half mile  radius   That I'm sure would want or loyalty and money.

I purchased a $75 gift card donated by Upward Projects at a silent auction last Saturday (yay!), so we stopped at the Windsor for Sunday brunch the next day. But when we handed over the gift card to close the check, our bartender said our gift card had zero balance! So this morning, I placed a call directly to Upward Projects and explained the situation to an insanely nice lady (Victoria?) who promptly got to the bottom of the situation and took care of it completely! What a great way to start a Monday: the customer service is just phenomenal with these guys. Love it!   Btw, brunch was absolutely fantastic, also in part to our wonderful Aussie bartender.

He came by once or twice after to ensure us that we would be seated soon, which was nice.   I had heard good things about the cocktails and ended up ordering the No. 17. It was awesome and I would definitely order it again. My sister got the No. 6 and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well. We decided to split the fondue and crab cake BLT. The fondue was great and the pretzels and sausage were perfect dippers. The crab cake BLT was good, but nothing really memorable. I don't think its anything against the sandwich itself, but just that I realized I prefer crab to crab cakes. Church potatoes were an awesome side!   Service was attentive and the food was well spaced out. We weren't rushed and enjoyed spending the evening enjoying the nice patio dining. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "Tried Windsor last night for the first time. I was having dinner with a friend and she really wanted something with a patio dinning area because of the awesome weather we've had all weekend. Thanks to some fellow reviewers we stumbled upon this place and thought we would give it a try.   Well worth it!! The outside seating section was excellent and got crowded just after we got there around 6:00pm. Unfortunately their happy hour ends at 5pm but both their beer list and cocktail selection looked outstanding.   For starters, we tried the Cheese Fondue appetizer with Pretzels and Apples. Amazing! Very creaming and tasty, could have been an entree on its own if you were in the mood.   For dinner I had the Porkwich, it combines bacon, pulled pork, ham and coleslaw a top a Kaiser roll. Very Tasty!!! All of the pork was tender and the crunchy coleslaw added to the various flavors. For the side dish, I had to try the Mac n Cheese. A bit more cheese and less bread crumbs would have make them perfect but you can't have it all. It was all mighty delicious.   We didn't wander over to the ice cream parlor next door but maybe next time.   Yes, it is bit pricey but seemed to be well worth it. Their happy hour does run all week long including weekends. Alos, make sure you look for street parking in the neighborhood next to the restaurant before surrendering your car over to Valet to save a bit.",

Their menu has something for everyone. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich and couldn't stop talking about it. I had the veggie stack (beets, quinoa, tomato, hummus on a pita) which was different, but delicious. I love that they pool tips so every waiter is your waiter. More restaurants should do this. Two thumbs up for Windsor!",

    "text": "I finally made it to Windsor after I got an e-mail for free ribs! That was the extra push I needed to make it a priority to visit this new spot. As I flew down Central I passed up the unassuming building and had to turn around and come back. The parking is a disaster like at Postino's in Arcadia but they have comp valet! But I was lucky enough to find one of the few parking places inside of the small lot. When I walked up I immediately noticed the fab patio and thought it would be a great place to enjoy brunch or lunch one day. Since it was 100+ outside my and the girls decided to eat inside at the bar. The place has great ambiance it's kind of dark and has a pub like feel to it. They have a great group of eclectic servers and bartenders that compliment the place very well!   I didn't order a drink surprisingly but  of course ordered the ribs and the kale salad as a side dish. The ribs came out and were mmmm mmm good!! Not because they were free either, lol...they were tender, flavorful and were covered with this AHmazing BBQ sauce... the sauce was sweet, tangy and just plain good. The chopped kale salad was yummy as well, it tasted really fresh, it had dried cranberries, almonds and some other stuff going on. Definitely something to think about making at home. The servers were all very nice and one of the bartenders talked to us about how he installed the purse hooks underneath the bar! We told him we def. appreciated his efforts :-)   I'm excited to come back and try some more deliciousness of the menu and maybe I'll even save enough room to get an ice cream sandwich from Churn next door.",

The service was pretty great with frequent check ins and drinks full the whole time. The atmosphere is nice and the staff are professional. Overall mixed feelings.",

Besides this delicious and nutritious side dish, I ordered the Brown Bag Pulled Chicken sandwich, which was good too- although it somewhat lacked in flavor. My mom's side dish was the Fried Okra, which was yummy too.  Besides the food, I love their outside patio- such a cute place to enjoy a glass of wine with the misters in the summer! Also I like the candy/ice cream shop in the back...I got to stock up on Pop Rocks which I don't see often enough. I also have to admit that I love their bathrooms, haha I know weird right? But seriously, the walls were cool inside and they were blasting reggae! Also the walls leading to the bathroom are covered in cassette tapes- such a cool idea!! I totally wish I could do that in my own place!   All in all, I would definitely come back when I'm in Phx again.",

We came here on Saturday night for my boyfriend's birthday and got a candlelit table on the patio. Patio's are perfect in October, and this one rules. The music they play is really good, but loud..which we enjoyed. It's busy, but not so busy that you have to sit and wait forever. I've gotten the brown bag chicken sandwich and the Windsor burger. While the brown bag has all the amazing ingredients to make an amazing choice, it lacks just a little bit of flavor and is a little dry and \"herby\" tasting for my liking. The burger however, is amazing. The sweet potatoes and fried okra are delicious as well. Four peaks pumpkin porter is a seasonal and we had that and the Sam Smith's cider.  (Two of my favorites). One of our friends ended the night by getting the birthday boy a Chocolate Elvis...which is ice cream, bananas, peanut butter and whipped cream. Windsor is awesome!",

    "text": "My taste buds got a sneak peak of Windosr back in March. I was a cocktail judge for the Arizona BBQ Festival and the friendly folks from Postino's introduced Windsor as a contestant in the whiskey competition. As I sipped a refreshing cocktail with only a subtle hint of whiskey, I made a mental note that as soon as Windsor opened their doors, I'd hop, skip and jump there as soon as possible. So with that, today was the day I made it through the whimsical doors of Windsor.   I met fellow yelper, Christina P for a patio lunch at this new Central Phoenix restaurant. Similar to its neighborhood brother, Postino's, Windsor's architecture has the same modern and minimalistic feel to it from the exterior, but once you walk through the doors, you enter an entirely different world. Parking is extremely limited at Windsor, but I decided to risk it and found one last spot on the side of the residential street. However, I don't think this residential parking will last long, so I suggest saving yourself a possible ticket and valeting it instead.   Atmosphere:   Like I mentioned above, Windosr is completely unassuming from the outside. I had no idea that it was so open and airy throughout the interior of the restaurant and they also have two patios in the back. One patio is smaller and more intimate, and the other is a little larger and seats more. Both are quirky and fun as well as airy but protected from the sun by an overhang. I felt like I was lunching on the back patio of a stylish friend's house. The tables are close together, but I never felt like I was in another table's conversation or they were in mine. This is a great restaurant for patio dining and I could see it not being too hot in the summer should I crave an outdoor lunch. The staff was also friendly and attentive and consistently refilled my diet coke, which is always a plus in my book.   Decor:  I love the decor of the Windsor. Think retro chic. Everything is very clean and minimalistic but once you look closer, you see how retro and fun everything is. Take the cassette tape wall for example. Yes, it's an actual cassette tape wall and all of the cassettes are authentic and awesome. They have everything from Genesis and AC/DC to MC Hammer and homemade workout mix tapes. It's almost like a memory wall for those who are products on the 80s or earlier! The bathrooms are funky, the walls have funky writing on them and the whole decor resembles a classed up garage that's been converted into a bar/restaurant.   Food:  Now moving on to the food. The menu is just as retro as the decor in the sense that they have classic items with a twist. They have everything from hot dogs and a crab cake BLT to pastrami Reuben and of course plenty of salads and starters. I am excited to go back and continue to try items off the menu, but today I decided to go for the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich which has pulled chicken with oven dried tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and herbs topped with avocado, watercress & green goddess goat cheese. Yes, it was as good as it sounds, but note that this is a cold chicken sandwich and not warm. It was a tasty sandwich but I think it would have been better heated. We also tried the Kale leaves as an appetizer. If you are a fan of Kale, you'll probably enjoy them. They also come with a chive mayo sauce that tastes a lot like the sauce you get with artichokes.   Between the food, atmosphere and decor, I really like Windsor and plan on adding this to my Central Phoenix rotation. Between Postino and Windsor, I am one happy camper!",

I don't drink alkohol, but they have my favorite non-alcoholic beer from the Guinness Brewery: Kaliber! My friends got martinis, white wine and then the food: Halibut Steak, Salmon, crab cakes...Veggies, we tried almost all different sides...all are so yummy, but the 'gratin potatoes'....heavenly! The portions are just the right size; the whole presentation looks great and believe me: It is enough...and leaves just a little room for dessert.All ingredients are superfresh, most are locally grown and cooked to perfection.Prices are budget friendly for the value and that's why the place is almost always busy, it's a bit of a family affair place, the staff made \"most\" of your wishes come tru and is friendly, experienced and so lovely. We left our valet parked cars on the premises, drove just with one car (we were still somehow able to all squeeze into the truck after dinner !!) to the Flash light tour at the Botanical Garden -another birthday highlight, walking around there at night...but still a bit warm in August- and back to the Windsor, but this time to their sweet sidekick: CHURN...ice cream parlor and sweets store, and got our various favorites*, sat outside in the packed backyard und just had all together a marvelous time. Another delicious pearl on the Restaurant string in Phoenix. *...I tried the \"Elvis\" at Churn a few weeks later - you don't even need dinner before, all I can say: Salty caramel cream...Elvis is alive!",

Just like Postinos they have the same drink special, $5 pitchers, special cocktails, and glass of wine before 5pm, but their menu is more extensive.  The menu is always changing, but some staples you will want to try are - Kale Salad (chopped or Caesar), Windsor Burger (if you get fries ask for the Gold Sauce for dipping), Ceviche, whichever platter they have in the starters, and the Pastrami Reuben.  When you are adding sides I would suggest the Jo's Church Potatoes (it is like hash browns mixed with mac and cheese), the Mac N' Cheese is great, and I am a fan of the Fried Okra.  Finish or start any of these with a pitcher, cocktail, or glass of wine and you will leave with a smile.  The Tape Wall is definitely worth checking out if you have never been here, it will bring back memories if you remember what tapes are.  Thank you Windsor.",

Wished they had a few more general beer selections. It's nice to do local and different, but I found both my picks to be not be what I was looking for. Like that someone walks thru the waiting crowd and gets drink orders, saves fighting at the bar. Had the Kabob appetizer and the Church potatoes as my entree. I make these same potatoes for every holiday meal.... they were good comfort food. The Kabobs were a selection of meat, shrimp and veggies (one of the veggies I had no idea what it was, although good) I wasn't thrilled with the dipping sauces though. It was a bit like a twist on mustard and ketchup with other things mixed in. Hard to describe, but would have rather had a good peanut sauce, or a spicy tereyaki like dip. Didn't do Churn next door, but will save that for a visit of it's own!! Hate the whole valet thing, although I understand it here since there is virtually no parking. But I did find a LEGAL spot in the neighborhood.... please be respectful of the folks who live nearby. All and all, I'll be back... the sandwiches at the table next to me looked wonderful, and I didn't get to see the restrooms (a strange quirk of mine)",

    "text": "Love all the Postinos/LGO/Chelsea's Kitchen places, so obviously had to try this one out! A friend and I went for lunch on a Tuesday. The patio looks wicked, too bad it was 140 degrees out and everyone was definitely waiting for an inside table. Had to wait about 15 mins but finally got a great table by the wall that says YES. Lunch cocktails and wine are apparently all $5, so I had a great pear cocktail/martini concoction that was delish. My friend got the paper bag chicken sandwich (YUM) and I got the quino (I always forget how to spell that word...) salad with a million grilled veggies. Flavor was a little bland- but it was just grains and veggies and goat cheese- so it was still yummy. I had to try the mac n cheese (I always do) and it was GREAT! Service was lovely- really nice waitress and the hostess gets 4 stars for having to deal with customers who appeared to be mad at HER that it was so hot out??? Weird.  We stopped at Churn (gelato place next door) after lunch and it was fantastic.  I'll come back to enjoy the patio, cheap drinks and mac n cheese soon!",

    "text": "We made our first trip to the recently opened Windsor tonight in North Central Phoenix.  Very enjoyable!  The influence of the Postino's ownership is felt when you enter the restaurant.  Cozy indoor space opening up into a well shaded patio area.   The menu selection is limited...think salads and bar food.  Drink options are plentiful.  We had the Halibut and Crab Cake BLT sandwiches, with good side choices beyond just the standard french fries and fruit salad.  Excellent and well recommended.  The only negative tonight was the waits at times once seated.  It certainly wasn't for lack of the servers' efforts, as they were clearly diligent and keeping busy for too many tables.  Hopefully this ratio is just a blip in opening, as the food and setting are definitely there.  We didn't try the ice cream options at Churn next door, but they definitely looked good.  We'll be back.",

We started with the vegetable chopped salad, which was amazing. The fried okra really made it. I had the bahn mi with macaroni and cheese. The sandwich was really fishy and the bun went soggy and gross immediately. The mac and cheese was completely inedible due to its saltiness. The boyfriend had the Reuben (which he really liked) and fries (another salt fest).  We'll probably come back for the atmosphere, but we'll just stick with drinks and salads next time.",

    "text": "Oh, how I adore the Windsor. I've been here many times. And it's taken me far too long to write a review. Centrally located (Camelback & Central) with a kick butt happy hour they offer impeccable service.  I like that.  On a sunny day when thinking of a patio? You should come here. The servers are a mix of pin-up dolls and retro styles. A bit of punk but no attitude. You can stand for more than a minute without multiple people asking if you've been helped.  I like that.  If you've got a large group, the Windsor can accommodate you. If you've got tiny human beings with you, the acoustics work in your favor. The rest of us can barely hear you! (And there are crayons for the tiny ones!) This is a dog friendly patio too. Neat!  I like that.  The sandwiches are wonderful. The soups and salads are too. I've eaten my way through quite a few. My first experience here with a sandwich was with envy. Yes, envy. I had eaten prior to joining for a happy hour, and my friend ordered the \"Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich\". Toasted hazelnuts, avocado, oven roasted tomatoes, goat cheese (HOH), chicken (OK, yes, I almost forgot that) and some green stuff hits the spot.   I came back and had that. A few times.  Today I had something called the \"Porkwich\". I was sold immediately by the mere mention of bacon. Pulled pork, tender belly ham, smoked bacon, layered with gold sauce & crunchy coleslaw on a buttermilk bun. YUM. No, I did not share with my table mate.    Hey, it was my HBD weekend :)  Nom, nom, nom! None for anyone else!  When the sandwich greeted my palate we were immediate friends. The bacon was perfectly cooked. Not over cooked or dry. But not under cooked either. Mixed with the ham and pork, the sandwich was a delight.  I like this place. I'll just keep saying that.  Got it?  I like this place!",

I've moved abroad and came home for a visit for the holidays and my friends wanted to visit with me for my birthday and to say goodbye before I left town.  My small group suddenly doubled and as a courtesy I rang the restaurant to give them a heads up and see if they could save a small section for us.  After being shamed by the assist general manager for expecting a same day reservation (on a Tuesday) he explained he would see what they could do.  As a group of working professionals, many who live in the neighborhood the staff appeared very bothered to accommodate us, we had to beg for service and they were visibly annoyed on the two occasions we asked for help with a group photo.  My friends all commented how rude and unprofessional they all were and it was really disappointing that my efforts to support a local business clouded a great reunion of friends. Sad to see what was once a great business go downhill.",

It was the worst excuse for a veggie burger. I always will go toward a homemade veggie burger. This had no flavor other than a mushy texture served almost cold  on almost raw kale. What is going on?Service was poor at best. Not only to our table but the table next to us had to get up and grab his waitress to get ketchup. We used to love Upward Projects Restaurants. Seems like something is amiss. Last time we went to Federal Pizza the manager took my pizza off the bill without my saying a word. Reason they put raw broccolini as a topping on my pizza. I didn't put that evening in Yelp. I just thought it was a fluke. But twice??? I am glad they have a thriving business and wish them well.

The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. The food is tasty and fresh as always... *sidenote* don't ever get rid of the fried okra... only place in town I can get it (and it's delicious)... it's expensive to travel home south to get more LOL...  The ambiance here is perfect for dates, friends, groups and even kids to take to Churn next-door.  Thanks Windsor for being a staple in my culinary world!",

I ordered their salmon kale Caesar salad and my fiance ordered the Windsor style backyard burger with Mac and cheese. Both were absolutely delicious!  I enjoy eating healthy but rarely do you see a salad coming your way on a server's tray and think \"wow I can't wait to eat that\". However, I found myself thinking that exact thing when my salad made its way to the table. The biscuit croutons are a nice little contrast to the kale and the salmon was cooked just right.  Service was spotty at best.. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes before someone greeted us but the food made up for it. Will be back and hopefully better service next time!",

    "text": "It was alright.   Had a group of 8 and tried to make a reservation but we were told they already had too many reservations and could not take more. So one individual in our party was the sacrificial lamb that was sent to wait ahead ; she went 45 minutes ahead. Everyone else arrived at 11:00am.  We were seated outside and had a long bench seat, which was nice but we only had two tiny bistro size tables. Three of us hung out sort of in open space with no table- awkward. The server didn't address the odd seating arrangement so I tried to get the attention of the next closest server. She said she couldn't help me but to see the hostess about the situation. The hostess said that they had a large reservation for 30 at 11:30 so they could not move any of the presently empty tables or chairs, we would have to wait until the next table vacated. The three of us hung out tableless for 30 minutes.   The wait plus the lack of space really doesn't make for a great start.  The food was okay, I had the grilled chicken sandwich and the kale salad. The grilled chicken sandwich was decent but not memorable. The kale salad was good. I had a few of the donut holes with marscapone cheese and preserves, that was my favorite part of the meal.  Others in my party also felt that the food was okay, but not something they would necessarily crave. The big negative was the pitcher of Pimm's with ginger beer- three people at the table said it was not a good combination.   \"Meh\"- that's about all I can say in summary.",

Finally got to check it out and I must say, can the savvy folks that own these establishments do anything wrong?  Windsor was a win.  When we arrived there was a wait, but  the cocktail servers quickly had drinks in our hands ( a 17 and a 63) and we wondered around  the patio area.   The wait flew by as we took a walk down their musical memory lane in the form of the hall covered in cassette  tapes and were told by the friendly hostess that our table was ready. We sat down in the dim dining room, the atmosphere was fun and light hearted, and our server was there with some water.  She was kind and attentive, and brought us more drinks ( a 22 and sean minor pinot noir) and took our orders. We opted for appetizers that night, The charcuterie (loved the assortment of picked vegetables), the Deviled Egg dip (this one caught our eye, and glad it did!), and the loaded chips ( good, not the best we had that night, but good).  Overall we had a great time at Windsor, there was a little mix up with my credit card and another tables tab, but the server caught it before she even set the card down and fixed the issue before it ever became a problem.    Great night, we will be back.",

They have a traditional Bloody Mary and my fave, the Verde Mary! Think green salsa with vodka...but in the best way possible!!! They also have a set up inside where you can customize your mary with 10-15 different types of pickled goodies, tons of different hot sauces, salts and seasonings. The ultimate mary bar! I also had this breakfast dish with cheesy mashed potatoes on the bottom, a crisp tortilla covered with two over easy eggs and salsa that was the quintessential Arizona breakfast. Just awesome! Great service as well!",

    "text": "My wife and I visited this locally owned establishment on a  Sunday afternoon in August prior to a d'backs game.  We had visited Churn several times in the past (an artisan ice cream shop that's connected to Windsor), but never got around to dining at Windsor.  So we got there around 11am, and it was busy...20 minute wait busy.    To kill time we browsed the menu and noticed a couple of things.  First, happy hour...they have $5  drinks until 5pm everyday.  We're not talking well either.  They have a solid selection of craft beers, and eclectic cocktails.    After a few minutes a couple seats at the U shaped bar opened up so we took those instead of waiting for a table.  What a great move on our part.  The bartenders are great people and like to hang out and talk.  Plus when you need help understanding some of the ingredients in their cocktails they're right there to answer any questions.   My wife ordered the No. 22 and absolutely loved it.  I tasted it and although i'm not into the fruity drinks, this one was refreshing and flavorful.    I ordered a Deschutes Mirror Pond to kick things off, and then followed up with the No. 63 based on the recommendation of the bartender.  At first I was leaning toward the No. 87 which i'll try next time.    Food....we started with the cheddar fondue appetizer.  I'll warn you, this is a meal by itself.  It's served with fresh apples, sausage, and soft pretzels.  The fondue had tons of flavor and even a little spicy kick.    After gorging on the fondue we could have stopped, but for whatever reason I was still hungry.  We chose the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with sides of fried okra and chopped kale salad.  If you like spicy you'll love the sandwich.  It has a curry rub, along with a spicy jalapeno mayo.  Plus the bread seemed rather fresh, but I'm not sure if they make it in house (maybe they get it from a local bakery...dunno).  While dining we looked around to take in the full experience.  The restaurant has a rustic feel, but the patio is where it's at.  I can't wait for the temps to cool so we can go back and chill with friends on the patio.  Oh yeah...and grab some ice cream at Churn.  Don't forget to check out the cassette tape wall!",

Nearly two weeks ago I had the most amazing cheeseburger at Windsor. It was everything and more! I felt happy, high, relaxed, and satisfied. Woo! I decided to come to my usual burger joint for a $6 burger and it was just ok. Now that I have experienced Windsor cheeseburgers I don't know if I'll ever be satisfied with Smash Burger. I feel like I cheated on my husband with a sexy man and now I look at my husband and although he has been consistently great, I now know that mindblowing is possible. I know, I'm so intense when it comes to food but you only say that because you haven't had that cheeseburger...  I ordered the Windsor cheeseburger with an heirloom tomato salad and #17 off the drinks menu. It was so good! I would consider it a food orgasm!",

Great atmosphere, good food and drinks, and good service. Can't ask really ask for much more. On to the good stuff:  I had a glass of the rickshaw Pinot noir, which I haven't seen for over a year when postinos stopped carrying it, +1 for Windsor for that alone! My girlfriend had a hoegaarden (though she asked for a lemon twice and never received it). The wine by the glass is on tap, so though I could buy it by the bottle, I couldn't take what I didn't finish home.   We started with the ceviche, which was pretty good, but the bowl of actual ceviche was pretty small, and the seafood in it was difficult to find in all the avocado. I'd probably skip it next time and try something else. There are some good looking apps on the menu (deviled egg dip, sauteed peppers, cheese fondue).  For entrees I had the brown bag chicken with Mac and cheese, which seems to be a favorite, and my girlfriend had the picnic skewers. Both of us thought everything tastes fresh and had no complaints. The ribs looked and smelled really good too!   Our original bartender was a little slow and not very helpful, but the guy bartender that was in and out of the bar was very friendly and makes a great margarita.   All in all it was a good dining experience, and we will be back. Churn is right next door for dessert too!",

The decor is an awesome, pseudo-industrial feel with a lot of metal and brick work, but they kept the padded benches and booths for a comfier feel.

They serve $5 wines and $5 pitchers until 5pm every day, but there are no food specials that I know of.   The salads are hearty, though not huge. They make their soups fresh and the ones I've had have been very good. My fiance likes the BBQ pork ribs, and I mix it up. The lobstah roll and fish sammich are yummy. If you go here and neglect to order the church potatoes as a side....just don't.

    "text": "Windsor is hands down one of my favorite places to go to in all of Arizona.  The Backyard Burger and the Pastrami Reuben are both delicious but my personal favorite is the Porkwich and as a guy... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  When I first discovered Windsor earlier this year, the Porkwich was the menu item that caught my eye as unique and a must try.  For the longest time, I had a difficulty trying other menu items because I enjoyed the sandwich so much.  Stepping out of your comfort zone and being adventurous is a good thing because they have other excellent menu items as well.  The Porkwich is still my guilty pleasure.  Windsor is part of the Upward Projects group who also own Postino's and Federal Pizza (both of which are amazing restaurants in their own way).  Windsor is an excellent establishment for both their food, bar, service, and atmosphere.  Inside where the bar is, there is a wall full of cassette tapes on a side wall.  Definitely cool.  They play great music in the restaurant / bar area and the atmosphere is definitely cool, the reason why the place is enjoyable.  Outside is a very laid back lounge / outdoor dining area with a fireplace.  Great food... fun and enjoyable atmosphere, what more could you want?  Oh yeah!  The reason why my brother loves this place is because they have a great liquor menu and I'm pretty sure the bartenders are amazing enough to make something complicated too if that's your thing.",

First there was a long wait to get to the booth, where there were pedestrians meandering in the car line. Then, once we passed off our car to the valet man, we heard an ear-piercing shriek coming from our car as it was being driven away. My husband guesses that he did not pull out the emergency break. It was a little scary. Not a great way to start the evening, although I'm sure it was a mistake. 2) Interior a bit dark and overly masculine for my taste, especially where we were originally seated, crammed into a corner. Hence the desire to be moved. 3) Music was not very enchanting. Rather, it was a lot of early-2000's radio hits (think Nickelback or Linkin Park). It did not match when we were seated in a fancy, beautifully-appointed outdoor patio. I would suggest something lighter or more romantic.  So, overall: great food but the atmosphere needs a little work.",

    "text": "Windsor is brought to you by Upward Projects, the team of superhero masterminds behind the much loved Postino Winecafes. They sneak into our dreams at night and create restaurants inspired by our innermost wishes and dreamscapes of the perfect urban bistro.  At least that's what I thought when I walked into Windsor. \"Damn, they nailed it again. I love this place. They have got to be infiltrating my head.\"  Comfortable but cool interior, great patio, large bar area for some neighborhood camaraderie and a little food voyeurism, and a zigzagged wall that says \"YES!\" in big red letters. Know what I say to that? You guessed it! It's YES, btw.  The bartender deserves a gold star for being totally attentive, soooo friendly, and a bonus glittery star for being too darn cute. Actually, all of the service staff were really, really nice. Gold stars for everyone!  The mixed grain salad was just one more reason I will be returning ASAP. I added smoked salmon and, holy moly! It was like 4th of July in my mouth with all the flavor explosions. I agree with some other reviews that a  couple of bites were a little overwhelmed by orange zest, but still loved the dish overall. Seafood ceviche was scrumptious, but not quite revelatory.  The guy next to me ordered a pork sandwich that looked out of this world. It also looked big enough to have it's own gravitational pull, and on second thought it probably did, because the entire bar area pivoted to stare, mouths agog. He said  \"shish ish sho schmood\", and that's a good enough endorsement for me. I'm coming back. And I want that sandwich.  Nice wine and beer list, and some very refreshing sounding cocktails with all manner of blueberry this and lemonade that.  Wake me up. I must be dreaming.",
