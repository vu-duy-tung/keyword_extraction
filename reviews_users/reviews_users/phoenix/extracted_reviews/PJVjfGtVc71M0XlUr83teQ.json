    "text": "Edited: When we went back to give it another try, the place was much cleaner, the staff much more attentive without being \"in your face\" and the food was much better.  We still prefer our food to have a little more \"zest\" than this does--it's fine but not exceptional--but they have certainly addressed the issues and we would go there again for a quick lunch or dinner--we would just order double extra garlic on our pizzas for more flavor.    We went there for lunch today for the first time.  We won't go back.  My husbands pizza was fine, but certainly nothing special.    My salad was pathetic.  Greens were fresh, carrots were fine, tomatoes were fine.  Then it all went downhill.  This was a \"meal\" salad at $8, not a side salad.  It was called the \"Health Nut\" but geez--just because I am trying to eat healthy doesn't mean I am not hungry and don't want a decent sized lunch.  Half of one red onion slice.  4 slices of an almond (as in less than 1 almond).  Less than a teaspoon of sunflower seeds.  About 1 ounce of chicken at best.  Halfway through our meal, the gentleman who appeared to be in charge came over to see how things were.  I told him I felt for a salad that was supposed to feature chicken and nuts, it should have more substance to it, that I would be going home hungry and have to eat when I got home.  His response \"More chicken next time--check\" and he walked away.  That was it.  I had to go home and eat a hard boiled egg, some nuts and fruit because I was still hungry.  Also, mold in the bottom of the soda machine (where the ice melts--we were just having ice water but eww... if they are letting you see that, what is inside?), area around trash can opening was disgusting and floor is dirty--you can tell they never move the furniture to mop.    Absolutely cannot recommend or go back.",

We had the pear-fect pizza which was light and delightful--it didn't have much (or any?) sauce and only used Gorgonzola cheese but it was delicious. Everything tasted really fresh. We also got the health nut salad which was even better than the pizza. The chicken was fresh and tender and the salad was really well balanced. I got free garlic knots for checking in which were also yummy. The ambiance was great too. Highly highly recommend.",

    "text": "Alright, so I woke up yesterday morning and my stomach was like, \"Damn, Andrew, you should get a salad\" and I was like, \"Damn, man, I fittn for a salad\". Immediately the bitter sweet thought of paradise bakery came to mind, with their impeccable southwest chicken ceasar salad + bacon + blue cheese + corn salsa. Why bitter sweet? Because their salads are so good, but so dang expensive, and I thought \"Man I am not fittn to pay $10 bucks for a damn salad\" - nah ming?  So I said to myself, \"well let's check out what yelp has to say about salads near me\". So I pull out my phone and I open up yelp and I type in salad. You wanna know what pops up #1 in salads on my yelp app? Mypie. That's right, Mypie. I'm thinking to myself \"What the eff is this place? I ain't never heard of it.\" so I open it up and look for pictures of salads to see what it is I might be gett'n into. Sooner or later it hits me, \"hey this place ain't so much a salad place as it is a pizza place.\" that gets me thinkin' and readin' some of the reviews and sure enough this place has a 4.5 out of 5 on yelp. I'm like daaaaaaaaaamn, this place must be gooood.\" So I think a litte further and I'm like, \"you know, I might be down to get down on some pizza rather than a salad.\" So I get into my car and cruise down to that shit.  I can't find it. So I pull over into Island's restaurant parking area and am lookin' on the map and I'm right where the blue dot says i should be, but I don't see Mypie. I'm thinking, \"Man, this place better still be in business, cause I am not down to go to paradise bakery and spend $10 bucks for a salad.\" So I give them a call, and I'm like \"Yo - where you guys be?\" The nice guy on the phone be like \"Aight, we be dwellin in the same area as sprouts and in-n-out\" and I was like, \"alright, thank you.\" So I drive over into that area (i was kind of already in that area, but whatev) and some how I still can't find it. So I keep driving and I pull over by the cold stone creamery, and start looking around, and BOOM, the overcast clouds opened up in one spot and shined the heavenly sunlight right upon the storefront of Mypie. Man I was glad I made it. So just so you know, Mypie is a tiny ass store located a couple of stores TO THE RIGHT of gamestop. I took a picture of it and uploaded it into yelp, so you otha paradise bakery ditchers wouldn't have to trek 20 miles to find this place - I hope you press the like button on the picture - show some love.  So I walk in and am instantly impressed. The place looks cool, there's cool music playing - im pretty much instantly in a great mood. So I look at the menu for a while and I decide on the spicy pig, or whatever it's called. I go up to the counter, which btw had no line, and they're like, \"what kind of crust\" - I say \"white\", then they're like, \"what kind of pizza\", I say \"spicy pig\", then I'm like, \"what kind of pizzas do you like?\" and he says \"spicy pig, spicy butcher, and afdaklfda\" I don't remember the last one he said. As he's doin his thing, I'm thinkin \"Man this pizza is look'n damn good.\" So I get up to pay, I pay, I get my drink, and I sit down - and boom my pizza is out and in front of me - fully cooked. I'm thinking \"wtf - it's been only like 2 minutes\". Yeah that's right, you're pizza takes like 2 mins to cook.  And did I say, the pizza was effin great? No joke, this is probably the best pizza place in phoenix. The pizza is around 8-10 inch, for around 8 bucks. Make sure to sign up for their discounts by texting mypie to 91944.  I guess when you taste something as sublime as Mypie, you want it for breakfast the next morning, ya figgadeal me? So I went and had that spicy butcher for breakfast this morning. Fu#$in great.  P.S. if you read my profile, you know I don't just give 5 stars to anyone. Mypie - you deserved this one.",

    "text": "IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER  With 75 total reviews, this marks THE VERY FIRST review I have ever updated. Providing fair, unbiased feedback for hard-working local businesses is very important to me and it is often the case that the True value of a concept cannot be judged by a single, subjective experience. In this case, My Pie is being whole-heartedly updated from a 3-Star review to a 5-Star.  A BRIEF EXPLANATION  After learning that the same team of owners who opened Crust Pizzeria also owned My Pie, I had to give My Pie a second chance. Crust Pizzeria is THE BEST pizza I have eaten since my childhood growing up down the street from a little New York style pizzeria in New Jersey.  So I ventured back to My Pie to see whether my initial judgement of the food was perhaps a bit hasty, even unfair. I was very lucky to run into one of the owners, Ryan, during my second visit and he spent a great deal of time with me, describing some notable highlights.  UPDATED OBSERVATIONS  For instance, I never noticed during my first visit that the entire interior of My Pie has been meticulously decorated so as to FEEL like a New York City pizzeria. From wall-length photos of the Brooklyn Bridge to subway-themed ordering instructions to the music playlist (featuring only big-name artists born in New York or New Jersey!).  Ryan also took time to introduce me to the ingredients My Pie has chosen to use including a Sicilian family recipe for the pizza sauce (also featured at Crust), pizza dough MADE FRESH DAILY from authentic Neapolitan pizza dough, high-quality canned tomatoes imported from Italy, and even cookie dough imported from New York and BAKED FRESH DAILY!  I learned that the pizza dough was specially rolled to produce the trademark NY-style crust after baking and that the ovens were firing these pies at 800 degrees F to produce that perfect oven-baked quality with only about 2 minutes of wait time.  And talk about DEALS! I should have mentioned this in my first review, but the pizza here is VERY fairly priced with \"endless topping\" options. Also a decent selection of beer on tap and even Happy Hour deals!  FINAL CONCLUSION  After eating here for a second time and being fortunate enough to speak with Ryan, I came away from My Pie feeling utterly impressed. I can't say I've ever met a more committed, passionate business owner than Ryan. The attention to minute details of food prep, ingredient quality, and overall experience goes over and above what most patrons will ever grasp.  As I mentioned in my first review, there seems to be a recent outcropping of \"fast-casual\" food concepts similar to My Pie, and I've been to several. NONE of them compares to My Pie. Visit this outstanding concept with your eyes open. An awful lot of time and thought went into it. Having seen that firsthand, I know I'll be back.  If you haven't been - GO! You won't be disappointed.  ***Thank you, Ryan and the My Pie crew, for working so hard to create a standout experience from start to finish. I couldn't be more impressed with the finished product. Keep up the great work!!",

    "text": "My Pie  When advertised as a Crust Restaurant was not sure I was real excited about this place.  Different pizza concept where you select certain predetermined items or build your own which was the most appealing idea. Was like ordering pizza and going thru Subway sub shop.   Tell them what crust you want between white, wheat or gluten free. What sauce and then start selecting what toppings you want.   They point out that their oven is at 800 degrees which explains why you pizza is ready in 10 minutes.  The employees are helpful and friendly and prompt in their service. Price is around $9.00 per pizza and if you sign up for their text message specials you can get some pretty good deals.  Will come back and try some other pizzas, tried the Spicey Butcher with mushrooms and olives which was good but had to take off the jalapenos after eating half.  Of all the build your pizza shops, have to say this is my favorite because of the pure taste of the pizza from crust to ingredients.",

They have vegan cheese if your pizza must have cheese. The pizzas are personal, but they are pretty big and could be split (my hub can eat a whole one and would think this splitting suggestion is silly).  We typically order vegan garlic knots, which come oozing with oil and chopped garlic, custom vegan pizzas, and salad.",

It was highly reviewed on Yelp and right on the bus route back to our hotel.   They had a kids special pizza which my oldest assured me she needed her own pizza. Reluctantly I got them each a pizza and my fiancee and I each got one of our own. A great decision as my oldest are her entire pizza and part of my youngest. The older one had a pepperoni pizza and the youngest a plain cheese. My fiancee and I had one Greek pizza 3.5/5 and one vegan 3.5/5 (substituting the vegan cheese for mozzarella).   The place itself to was setup much like a mucho burrito in the new tradition of assembly line like ordering. Normally I would have made up my own combination but we hoped to catch the next bus so we went off the menu. Next time I'd hope to have more time to choose my own combination of toppings sauces and cheeses.",

    "text": "Seeing the other reviews and the fact that this is in my neighborhood I thought I'd finally give it a try. To be honest (and to date myself), this location has always been a pizza place. Way, way back it was called Sammy B's Pizza. Loved it then.  This is a small place, not much seating inside but more outside. Everyone I interacted with was very friendly and explained how it all works. I got a pizza, half salad, order of garlic knots and a cookie - TO GO.  The service was good from everyone except the 2 guys whose job it was to cook the pizza's and get orders out.  There is not a lot of room back where they are and they seemed to be constantly in each other's way. This seemed to slow them down too.  I saw my pizza come out first and then sit while one of the guys just kept ignoring it to deal with inside orders. WTF?!  It sat and got cold until one of the other worker's told the guy to get the rest of the order going. It took them way too long to get the salad (lettuce, cheese and dressing), and garlic knots together to finish my order. This is my biggest disappointment of my experience.   Price - fair for what you get  Food - pizza was fine. I think I will have to play with getting some other toppings so it tastes a bit better. It wasn't bad pizza, but it also wasn't the best pizza either. Somewhere in the middle. Good for takeout and to satisfy a quick pizza craving.  The garlic knots were decent as well. Again somewhere in the middle. I've had better elsewhere. These seemed to be lacking enough garlic flavor, they were more just oily.  I will definitely try this place again and hope for a more satisfying experience with food and service. Fingers are crossed!",

If you eat there, the floors are concrete and the ceiling is open so there is an echo and it can be difficult to carry on a conversation.

I love the fact that even though it's a casual food place, the servers will also bring your food to your table if you like! Lots of places in the same price range don't do that, so it's an extra bonus IMHO.  Clean, accessible restrooms. Comfortable casual seating, both inside and out. But most importantly, friendly servers who go the extra mile to make sure your time and your money are well-spent! Give My Pie Pizza a try - you'll love it!",

The great thing about My Pie is they don't charge you per topping, so you can build your own pie with as many toppings as you want!  My favorite is the MY Greek Pie, but we've ordered several different pizzas and they've all been delicious!!!  I highly recommend this place to everyone!!  And they have great beer and wine prices all day, every day!",

My boyfriend has tried the angry bird, mr white, and some other meat type that were all less than good. It's fresh and fairly fast. I love the thin crust and customer service has been good. everything tastes fresh. The best: sauce with Evoo, it makes the crust more moist which beings out the Flavors. I'll likely continue to only order the power pizza. Wish there were more good pizzas. Oh and they're fairly small too! Enough for one hungry person or two less hungry people to share and split a salad.",

Staff has always been very friendly, attentive and has assembled my pizza quite nicely. The warm chocolate chip cookie is like a dream...what a treat! The pizza crust is good--not thick and fluffy, but it's not thin and crispy either...it's right in the middle. I got the garlic and olive oil base instead of red pizza sauce. And 3 out of the 3 times I've eaten here it's been dripping with olive oil. That was my menu selection so it's partially on me, but employees should know how much of an ingredient to put on the pizza too. Or take the olive oil+garlic base off the menu because it doesn't work. Just once the crust was a tad under-done and that's probably because I loaded on the toppings! Overall a really good experience. Great price ($9-$10 for a 1 person pizza), good pizza, good text rewards program, excellent employees. Pizza comes out fast, piping hot, and so delicious.",

You choose your crust, they offer white, wheat and gluten-free and then your can choose your toppings.  If you are not up to making those decisions, they have some suggestions on the board.  They also offer salads.  Tim is always so helpful with the wines or beer.  The first time I went we were a large group, so it took a bit to get all the pizzas out.  We were 20 women, we took over the patio area, Armando was also very nice helping us with refills for our drinks.  I enjoyed my experience so much that I had to bring my hubby. The weather is so beautiful right now that we couldn't resist but enjoy the patio.  He chose a wheat pizza, so I had the opportunity to taste the crust.  It was really good.  I might get it next time.  Although their regular crust is so yummy and chewy.  We'll see.",

    "text": "Wish I could rank the food and the service separately. The pizza was very good. MIL and I split a San Gennaro: thin crust, bright sauce, slightly spicy sausage, peppers, and caramelized onions. MIL didn't like it as much, but she doesn't do spicy, even a little bit. I would definitely have it again. The best part of the experience, though, was the service. 5*! Both the young woman who made our pizza and the man (probably the owner?) were super nice and solicitous. He even gave us a free order of garlic knots and sauce for coming in - they were REALLY yummy! - and checked to make sure all was well. I'd return in a heartbeat because there are lots more choices on their varied menu I'd like to try - and to see their faces light up.",

    "text": "We decided to try My Pie tonight as my husband and I want to customize our pizzas due to dietary restrictions. My husband can't have dairy and I skip dairy in solidarity with him. So, we created a to-go order online. We were pleasantly surprised that they offered Daiya (dairy-free) cheese. Since my husband likes Daiya he got that and I decided to get no cheese (I didn't check any cheese option online, they didn't offer a \"no-cheese\" box to check). I guess my husband should have checked the pizzas before he left the store because when he got home we saw that my pizza had mozzarella on it and his was missing his chicken.   The food itself was just ok. The toppings seemed just... flat,  not much taste. Maybe it was just a Sunday night and things weren't as fresh?  Having them forget/mistake ingredients plus the taste being just bland was pretty upsetting considering the cost. I think next time we will try a different make your own pizza place.   Updated: after I left my review the owners almost immediately contacted me to apologize and make amends. I really appreciate them trying to fix their mistake & will think of going there again",

    "text": "Heading to My Pie Pizza has become a Sunday evening tradition as my girlfriend and I share a pie each weekend along with some delicious garlic knots.  The first time we stopped by, we really didn't know what we were doing as we tried a new place.  Now, it is something we look forward to during the week.  The food is delicious, the service is superb, and the customer experience is overall very positive.    Each time we head there, the line moves very quickly, and we have never needed to wait more than two minutes to place an order.  The staff are very patient even when my girlfriend and I cannot agree on a topping and end up having two completely different halves.  The staff provide recommendations (perhaps as I ask so many questions).  Word of advice: ask for the garlic knots to be placed in the oven as you're ordering your pizza pie; do not wait until you are at the register.  After you finish ordering your pie, it goes into the over, but often with paying your bill, you may only be waiting for a few minutes for your order to come out of the oven all ready for you.  I always am offered a cup if I'd like some water while I am waiting, and I've even been offered a sample of one of their DELICIOUS melt-in-your-mouth cookies, which I highly recommend.

    "text": "My Pie... My gosh. I ordered a Spicy Butcher with extra sausage, because unlike other pizza establishments the \"My Pie\" pizza truly is my way, with no extra charge. Ah, I just realized that is why it's called My Pie. Adorable.   I have such a big fascination for New York style pizza establishments, I rigged the cleaning mode on my kitchen oven to allow me to cook at 900 degrees. Unfortunately, I don't have the benefit of the fresh ingredients and sauces available at My Pie, so I'm closing the book on that chapter of my life and just eating here from now on.  As you can see in my picture, the pizza came out perfect, and the texture and crunchiness of the crust was a perfect contrast to the sauce and toppings. I'm usually a responsible adult that never over eats, but I had gone so long without a pizza like this I just couldn't stop myself. I ended up ordering an Angry Bird to take home, as the thought of Buffalo Chicken on top of a barbecue sauce pizza intrigued me, and it was the right choice. I'm not a huge fan of ranch sauce, but they really nailed the consistency on their ranch drizzle. Went perfect with the Buffalo Chicken and red onions.  I didn't try the garlic knots, but I watched someone else eat them and would've been very jealous had I not gone to town on a Spicy Butcher.",

I think the thing that puts My Pie on top is their ingredients. And they don't skimp, so you have to be careful not to get carried away and put too much on your pizza creation!

    "text": "I came by here last week for a one o'clock lunch and was impressed by the quality and taste of their pizza.   We've been to Crusts a bunch of times and have never made it over to their new quick individual pizza place near the PV Mall. It's actually few doors down from where the old Atomic Comics use to be.  I find MyPie is very similar in setup to Fired Pie on Northsight. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/fired-pie-scottsdale#hrid:aWt21x1Kt7IlKg41opmbug\">yelp.com/biz/fired-pie-s...</a>  But the taste is better at MyPie in most instances and they excel -- way over the top at customer service. Crazy nice!  I went with the Margherita ($7.49) pizza (photos) with some sweet italian sausage ($1.00).  It was very good, so I ordered a regular one without sausage for home.  That pie wasn't as special as this, but overall slightly better than the one at Fired Pie.  Recently, the WSJ had an article on how Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has quietly joined a growing group of restaurants aiming to change how we eat pizza. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.us.wsj.com%2Farticles%2FSB10001424052702304403804579264220659257040%3Fref%3D%2Fnews-lifestyle-arts-entertainment&s=ae616ce0c4b91affd0d29f60422fbd35993c4a53fcf793d26948679976b3c542\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB...</a>    My friends in SoCal tell me these are very similar to Pieology: \"Pieology prides itself on providing the best tasting, healthiest kustom pizza in the world. Using only the freshest ingredients, Pieology provides smoking hot pizzas in under 5 minutes.\"    Whereas, Fired Pie says: \"Fired Pie, a fast, casual, rich in flavor customizable pizza and salad made from scratch using fresh ingredients just the way you like it - all at a respectful price.\"  No matter!  I like My Pie slightly better than Fired Pie, but both are very good.  Expect to pay $10 to $12 for a very tasty individual wood fired pizza.  So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.  Enjoy!",

The easiest way to find them is to look for Today's Patio and they are located just to the north. We are huge fans of their sister restaurant Crust on Tatum and decided to try out this new place with a coupon deal we bought. We stopped in on Monday for lunch with a coupon deal. The pizzas are about 12\" in diameter and there is a choice of crusts including a gluten-free one. The toppings and cheese choices are included in the price of the pie and you can load on as many as you'd like. They also have these delicious chocolate chip cookies that they keep warm near the register you just have to try! I tried their margherita pizza which is slightly more than $8, but most of their pies are $7.75. Their salads are only $4.50 and are definitely \"side salad\" size. Once you order, they give you a number to take to your table and the drinks, etc. are all self-serve. They have the garage door concept instead of walls of windows and the day we were there, the whole restaurant was opened up to the patio. They have happy hour all day, everyday for beer. If you spend $4 for your first beer, refills are only $2 and they are not peddling your every day Budweisers and Millers. I was only able to eat half my pizza for lunch and there are boxes available at the drink station to take your leftovers home. I can see where they might get jammed up if they are busy since everything is handmade, but in my opinion, the pizza is worth waiting for.",

They cook it quickly, to order -- we went from ordering to eating in about 5-10 minutes. Nice open-air environment on a gorgeous Friday night. Bonus points for having San Tan Hop Knot IPA on draft. $4 for the first and 50% off for the 2nd. Service was just o.k., they \"lost\" our friends' orders, but eventually worked it out. Great place.",

I've probably visited this place with different friends and family members a dozen or more times and I've never been disappointed. One price for pizza and you can become a combo wizard with just about any great topping you can think of. They offer a great gluten free crust as well that I understand is bought from a California company after an exhaustive search. The crew here is professional and extremely helpful and willing to go the extra mile to make sure you're getting the pizza you want. There is one gentleman in particular that deserves kudos. He appears to be always working and is so good with the patrons. My wife comments on it every time and hopefully the owners know what an asset he is. If you're in the area, you have to stop and grab a My Pie...it will only take you 5 minutes max and make sure to throw in a chocolate chip cookie...those are dangerously good and gooey.",

You could choose from a list of pizzas or make your own.  It's like \"Build your own pizza\".  The guy checking us out at the register was so friendly, he just chatted with my daughter and I about miscellaneous things, before we were even rung up our pizza was done.  It was so yummy.  They had such a variety of items.  My daughter and I had a pizza with chicken, bacon, and pesto sauce on it.  They offered gluten free items, they offered vegan choices.  I cannot wait to go back.

The concept is simple - lots of fresh ingredients, piled on thin crust and baked and ready to eat super fast! I like that you can choose from their pies or you can create your own.   I chose the Greek pizza and I was not disappointed. I love Mediterranean food and this one was one of the best. I think the secret is the balsamic drizzle that they put on after the pizza comes out of the oven.  And if you're a picky eater, the people there are so nice, they're ok with \"a little this, a few of that\" too. They make you feel like your best friend.   To sum it up - If you're looking for a casual place to grab a dinner, you've found it. I can't imagine anyone walking away disappointed!",

There are several suggested pizzas they'll make for you (try the Spicy Butcher for a little kick or My Uncle Nicky to satisfy your meatball craving) or you can just make your own.    The best part?  After ordering your pizza will be done before you can return a text, it's literally 2 minutes, yes 2 minutes.  Yowza!

Whoa, is that what I think it is?  In other words, game on and My Pie has game.  Simple concept, walk in and order one of their specialty pizzas or have them put together a masterpiece that only you come up with.  I had the Spicy Butcher and it was a terrific pizza. Served fast and right out of the oven, made for a tasty lunch.  I overindulged a bit and in addition to scarfing the entire pizza in one sitting (I think it's big enough to share or take half home), I also devoured one of their monster chocolate chip cookies that they shamelessly and without a hint of remorse have at the counter for weak-willed, belt-expanding lost souls like me.  I sat there and literally counted the calories somewhere in the Y2K range (why indeed).  I always try to cleanse my palate with a morsel of chocolate after lunch but this took it to a new level.  I had a months worth of cleansing in one sitting, and don't think I won't want more chocolate tomorrow.  Solid four stars and I'm going back again this week.

The pizza was pretty standard, but maybe some of their more specialty items would be more unique and tasty.  I did enjoy the garlic knots, but when they say garlic they mean it... these babies are powerful.  Finally, I'm a cookie person, and though the cookie was good, it didn't blow me away.  All this being said, I'd for sure go back and try more custom pizzas. For the price and service, I'd highly recommend giving My Pie a try!",

We opted for the last choice with pizza sauce, a bit of spicy sauce, sun dried tomatoes, bacon on half, spinach, 3 cheeses and garlic.  A server will bring your pizza to the table in a few minutes.  The pizza was great, and service with a smile.  There are other selections in the menu such as salads,  There is inside and outdoor seating.  Good value and quick service especially if you're in the run.    Back at My Pie.  Last visit I gave them 4 stars.  The owner, Ryan, contacted me and asked what My Pie could do to get 5 stars.  I made a few suggestions and he came through.  I was very impressed by the great customer service.  We ordered pizza and spicy sauce, Parmesan, mozzarella and fresh mozzarella, olives,tomatoes, red peppers, sausage on half, and oregano  Our pizza came quickly as usual.  Great service and excellent pizza.  Thank you Ryan and fellow workers.  You made our visit enjoyable.",

Great patio area that's well shaded in the evening. We had a spill and they cleaned it up and topped us off without a fuss.   I wish the pizza was a bit more crispy, but that's just my personal preference for thin crust. I look forward to coming back and trying a pie with more toppings to see how it compares.",

Opt for the sales pitch from the server if it is your first time there as they will explain it all and offer up their recommendations. I opted for the Uncle Nicky with ricotta and meatball. The crust is perfect. Crispy yet chewy. The sauce was a little bland but overall the pizza was good. My husband had the plain NY and really enjoyed his. I tried a bite as his sauce was different than mine and I found that it was better but still not great.  We ordered, grabbed a soda and then ate outside on the patio as the weather was perfect. My husband devoured his pizza but I still had half of mine left. They have small to go boxes ready and waiting so you can pack up your leftovers and be on your way.",

    "text": "With all of these subway-type-of-make-your-own-pizza joints, it's almost hard to tell them apart. You really can't mess up your own pizza creation...can you?   My pie has great pre-selected \"My Pies\" for those that don't want to sit there and choose and need some inspiration such as the \"Hot Hawaiian\" which is mozarella, ham, pineapple and jalepeno.    The real fun comes with loading your own topics! They recommend not going over about 7-9 toppings, as well the toppings get watered down and heavy, it also takes longer to cook.   Here are the steps:   1. CHOOSE YOUR CRUST white,  wheat , gluten free  2. CHOOSE YOUR SAUCE pizza sauce , spicy fra diavolo , marinara ,  alfredo cream *, savory bbq , garlic and evoo , pesto  3. CHOOSE YOUR CHEESE mozzarella,  fresh mozzarella (balls of mozarella which I recommend!) ,  ricotta ,  feta , gorgonzola , vegan  4. CHOOSE YOUR PROTEINS pepperoni,  sausage, meatballs , salami , ham , applewood bacon ,  hormone-free chicken and spicy chicken  5. CHOOSE YOUR TOPPINGS tomatoes * mushrooms * fire roasted red peppers * red onions * garlic * fresh spinach * black olives * kalamata olives * pepperoncinis * jalapeno * green bell peppers * caramelized onions * pears * pineapples * artichokes  6. ADD ANY APPETIZERS  I recommend either the garlic knots or the meatballs. The meatballs came with 4 huge meatballs and some side bread. Meatballs were tender, juicy and soooo good. Cookies, while I didn't get any looked super fresh and delicious.   7. PAY UP   Pay at the end, and grab a stick with the number. They bring out your food to you.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I got the wheat crust with mushrooms, pineapples, red peppers, mozarella balls, red onions and artichokes and every ingredient was fresh, and super tasty! If if you don't know which red sauce to get, I mixed both together! You can also do half and half. The wheat crust was so good, I couldn't even tell it was wheat crust.   Service was friendly, the guy explained the whole process to us and called it his \"speel.\" We enjoyed it and listened to it all. The other staff recommended the meatballs which I got and recommend as well.   Parking was easy pease...in a huge giant parking lot.   Enjoy...your...i mean ..MY PIE!",

My husband wasn't a bit fan of the crust as he is a big time Pizza Hut deep dish pizza lover. But no worries, I ate his pizza too!   We got the Hot Hawaiian and the Spicy Butcher. In my opinion, the spicy butcher has much more flavor going on than the Hawaiian. I loved it! The Hawaiian was a tad boring... Sorry.   The garlic knots were sorta so so... A bit too bland for me. Don't get me wrong, the fresh garlic is enough to keep a family of vampires at bay, but there was some flavor lacking.   Can't beat the $4 beers either. Overall, staff was friendly, facilities were clean and food was tasty. I will be back sans hubby.",

Since you order your pizza \"Subway Sandwich\" style, you can view all the ingredients. They didn't  look very fresh. The dough is formed ahead of time and sitting out on individual wooden boards. The blue cheese crumbles looked like they were dried out, translucent and filled too high to be at proper temp. The sliced sausages was grey, not reddish as a fresh batch should be. Granted I'm pretty picky when it comes to my food, but I do believe if your ingredients are going to be on display, they should at least be fresh.",

Many great choices to pick from! We chose the Pesto My Chicken and the Spicy Butcher! The ingredients are fresh and the thin crust was perfect! Yum!!

The prices are affordable and you can't beat $4 draft beers and wait for it... $2 refills???? What is that??? We must introduce that to Los Angeles!!!!  As soon as we walked in Grant greeted us and told us about the favorites! Then moved on to Kyle who told us about the drafts and his recommendations! The guys here are very hospitable and very attentive to our needs and kept checking on us to make sure we are ok. We arrived close to closing but Grant made us feel at home and didn't rush at all!!! We are here for a good 2 months and this is the best place to unwind after a long week and eat great tasting pizza, salad, addicting garlic rolls, tasty crisp draft beers, and OMG the chocolate chip cookie, YUMMY!!! Love this place and the staff!!! Grant is the best host!!!!",

Crust was disappointing without any flavor, basically inert on all three.  Mr.White was overpowered by garlic and the buffalo mozzarella was tasteless and of low quality.  The Hot Hawaiian was probably the best of the three but nothing special as the pizza sauce was pretty bland.  The Pesto My Chicken was meh, mostly because the chicken itself was flavorless and suffered from the same bland sauce. Overall, I would say that more effort needs to be put on to developing the flavors of the individual ingredients for these pies to really soar. Great concept that is currently falling a bit short.",

It's great how you get to choose everything from the dough, to the sauce, and all the toppings you want, for the same price! Well, if you go a little overboard, they will let you know that once you start piling the toppings that the pizza won't cook all the way. The guy that helped us explained the whole process and explained the different sauces to us also. He was very helpful and enthusiastic about it, which made the experience even better. Because I am indecisive I went with one of their creations and added some extra toppings just to make it perfect. It's not the best pizza in the world but it's pretty good for the price you're getting it for. You can join some type of membership at the cashier by entering your phone number in. We did that and got a coupon for a $5 pizza. I'll be coming back real soon, especially bc I live 5 minutes away",

The staff was so knowledgable and my friend got a gluten free pie.  They even had a gluten sensitive pie crust choice for the next level of gluten free dietary needs .  My son had a Caesar salad and we had the bread knots and to die for chocolate chips cookie.  I will go back it was so yummy!",

Then you get to the fresh counter. One size pizza. One size!!! Yay!! Three choices of dough! Yay!! Then you get all the topping options out there. We had two, the Hot Hawaiian and the Power Pie!! Both so good! Then you stand there and watch your master piece be created and cooked in a super duper hot oven. Less than 5 minutes!!! Love, love, love the crust!!! So delish!!!! In addition, they have tap beer and wine. Did I mention the customer service?!? All the staff behind that magical counter were so nice and helpful! It was our first time so had a lot of questions!!

Just the right amount of grease in the sauce, mind you, I grew up in North Jersey and often had pizza in NYC. My wife had the lunch special which included half a pizza, salad and drink. Absolutely loved her food. The meatballs, which were a side item could've used a little more oregano but the garlic knots were spot on amazing. Management was super friendly as well and the environment was perfect. Not too quiet but not very loud like some places are. There is outdoor seating but we're still trying to adjust to the heat. My wife keeps bragging about how much she loves the meatballs",

Ryan, VP of Operations, reached out to me and apologized for the experience. He wanted me to try them out again and hopefully my experience has improved. We recently had my relatives place a to go order for us for three pizza pies and a salad.  This order fed five of us and we even had leftovers. Everyone including myself enjoyed the pizzas. There was one that had a gluten free crust and it wasn't bad. Overall, if you are looking for a place that is quick and inexpensive, this is a good restaurant to get a quick pizza. Thank you Ryan for trying to make me a fan, but you did better - you made five fans!   I had high expectations visiting My Pie because of the 4.5 overall star rating. We walked in to an empty restaurant for lunch and we were surprised to see they were set up like the \"Chipotle\" concept. There's another pizza company that does this around the valley and we are a big fan so we can't help but to compare.  We order the San Genaro pizza with mushrooms on white crust with a regular Healthy nut salad and two chocolate chip cookies. The pizza and salad just didn't cut it for us. I wasn't a fan of the crust, but the food just didn't taste and look fresh. The greens in the salad looked like it had been sitting out for days and it had a brown tint to it, there was too much dressing and the chicken was flavorless. The chocolate chip cookie though was good.",

I however, LOVE thin crust pizza so this was great!  They also have happy hour all day! $6 for a glass of wine and then $3 unlimited refills? Umm, yes please.

The atmosphere is kinda kitschy -- it looks like it used to be a Pennzoil station with the roll-up garage doors, but all in all it adds to the charm.  And you really can't beat the prices.  You get to watch them make your order right in front of you, and you can customize it in basically any way.  I recommend at least giving the gluten-free pizza a try, especially if you have never had anything gluten-free before.  It will not let you down.  Friendly staff completes the four-star review.",

My fave is to get a grandma's pie and customize it with a little kalamata olive, roasted red pepper and artichoke. I definitely recommend their classic pies but if you do customize don't over top. this style of pizza isn't meant for the whole kitchen sink. Also I like the Mediterranean lover salad you can tell everything was chopped in house that day. We need more restaurants like this! You can't beat affordable and fresh!",

    "text": "Overall: 4.5/5  Food: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5 Decor: Nice decor and clean Price: Great!  Food: Power pie - My favorite! I had my doubts when ordering something that sounded like a \"power bar\" type of healthy tasteless thing, but this pizza proved me wrong. Generous amount of garlic and EVOO and stringy melty cheese that works very well together with toasted almonds and the tomato. The crust was a default wheat crust which turned out really crispy, maybe even more then regular white crust. Spicy butcher - Great crust with meatiness from pepperoni and sausage, though I could not taste the spiciness too much.  Customized pie - White crust with BBQ sauce, it was then loaded with a lot of meat, chicken, sausage, bacon, that's all I can remember. Topped with mushroom, caramelized onions, and other good stuff. I hate to say it, but this one disappointed me, while the meat and caramelized onions were good, I could not pick up the BBQ sauce too much, and my crust was burnt on the bottom .   Service: Great, person making out pizza was friendly and gave us a quick intro to customizing pizza to your liking. Pizza only took a few minute to cook in the 800 degree oven. On top of that, no wait!  Decor: The place was clean and you can watch the whole process as they make your pizza. The place a was a bit cramp near the entrance and the seating was squeezed too tight, but there are also outdoor seating if you like.  Price: Each pizza was about $9, and 3 pizza was enough for 4 of us though we weren't too hungry. I'd say one pizza per person would be a good portion.   Overall, I really like this place and would definitely come back again when I am in Phoenix. You just cannot beat the price and for a great crispy pie!",

I was thrilled to see their setup and loved the intro and explanation of things from the person taking our order. The pizza is thin-crust, so if that's not your thing, this probably isn't the best place for you. Thankfully, I love thin-crust pizza. I had the My Greek - and it was awesome. The crust was perfect, ingredients tasty, overall flavor was on point. We also tried the Sneaky Salami, Hot Hawaiian, and the cheese and pepperoni kids pies. All really good. Both kids ate their whole mini-pizza, which never happens. Garlic knots were awesome - lots of flavor and super garlicky. Took some chocolate chip cookies to go - also good. Finally, a good thin-crust pizza place! Would definitely come here again.",

They're really outgoing and accommodating. Also, the interesting pizza choices and toppings are pretty nice. If you want to drink, they have beers and wine.  Cons: Gotta especially say \"eh\" to the pizza. The woman and I went in with a buy one get one coupon, and ended up paying about $10. The pie itself is probably around 8-10 inches, but it's one of those places that has the really thinnish crust and the toppings are kinda scant for that price. I get that they're new and maybe there's some overhead being in that place or something, but I dunno. Speaking of the place/atmosphere, it's not so bad; except it's pretty small and pretty much all the seating is directly in the afternoon sun, as the storefront is all glass and they have no blinds or anything.   Anyway, back on the pizza: It wasn't really that good. Somewhere inbetween a Kashi frozen pizza and maybe Brixx or something. Also not sure what's so innovative about their \"concept\" that the other reviewers are talking about; pretty sure you can get pizza made however you want at any other pizza place.  All-in-all, I'm probably not going back but I won't say it's a horrible place or anything.",

Another bonus is that they have draft beer!  I ordered a sausage pizza with dairy free cheese and garlic knots. The pizza sauce was nothing special. The sausage had no flavor. The crust was cooked to a crispy perfection.   The garlic nots would be an item you shouldn't order on a date because my breath stank of garlic and EVOO. I would ask for them for light EVOO because they put an unpleasant amount on my order. They put a lot of garlic, but I prefer it that way. The knots also had a nice doughy taste to them. Some places feel like they microwave there knots but this place bakes them perfectly. However the Marinara had no flavor to it.  I would try here again but order something better next time.",

Tucked away next to sprouts, this location has a nice mix of indoor seating and outdoor seating with a side patio and small front patio. Once entering, the staff will build your order and you'll pay at the register at the end. Then they will bring out your meal to you when it is ready.   There is a \"pizza your way\" option which is fully customizable or you can select from one of their predetermined determined options for about $8-9. They also have calzones, \"pieninis\",  and salads. Plus garlic knots and chocolate chip cookies for a starter and dessert.   \"Pizza your way\" allows you to select a crust (white, wheat, gluten free and now cauliflower), your sauce, cheese and toppings. They have a nice variety of toppings to choose from, from proteins to veggies. My girlfriend got the pizza New York (sauce, mozzarella, Parmesan) and said it was okay.  The garlic knots were pretty solid. I have tried both the NY Roni and a bbq sauce, chicken and pineapple pie and really enjoyed both. Their cookies are served warm and are pretty good.   I think for the price you get a great value here, especially when compared to similar chains.",

They revamped the place with a modern, hip interior. It's a little overwhelming when you first walk in, but the super friendly employees explain the process and make you feel at ease.   I ordered the Greek pizza after much deliberation. I was worried about time because I had less than 30 minutes before I had to be somewhere. But my pizza was cooked freakishly fast. Right after I payed and got my drink my pizza was brought to me.   The pizza was a very good size for a personal. I couldn't finish it. Even though I wanted too because it was deeeelish. The crust was amazing... it rivals a certain pretentious pizza spot with a 4 hour wait. Crispy with just the right amount of chew. The toppings were fresh and plentiful. My only complaint would be that I don't care for the balsamic drizzle on top... it didn't mesh well with the Greek flavors.   This place is going to be put into my rotation. It is a great place to bring anyone... a date, your kids, etc. Also great for a (very) quick lunch. Can't wait to explore more combinations!",

A True example of going above and beyond to leave a positive, lasting impression on each and every customer. The last time I dined here, a small piece of my pizza fell off in the pizza oven. It really wasn't a huge deal; but the staff immediately created a new pizza and threw it in the oven - and THEN told me what happened. While my original pizza was perfectly fine (and absolutely delicious), they insisted on giving me one to go as well. Not necessary, but absolutely appreciated and impressive.  Great place to meet friends, take the family, or swing in by yourself. Everyone can order exactly what they want - so everybody's happy.",

I ordered the New Yorker both times I was there, the second time I tried their garlic knots. One word:  YUMMY!!!  Mouthgasm!    For one like me who eats one or two slices and is full, their pizza provided four meals so a definite bonus!  Delicious cold too...  Generous with sauce, which was AMAZING by the way...    Haven't tried the ice cream cups yet, perhaps next time when I try a pizza other than the New Yorker.  Now to decide which friend to bring...  Hmmm...  Decisions, decisions...

I must say that the ingredients are fresh and high quality.  I ordered a gluten free pizza since I have a subtle reaction to gluten. It was simply delicious and filling.  The pizzas are 11\" in size and come in a custom box.  If you enjoy a personal pie now and again, this is your place.  The staff is friendly and outgoing.  The restaurant has a San Francisco Bay Area feel to it.  There are charging cables for phones and electronics and LED lights above.  A gem in an otherwise over franchised neighborhood.",

Such reasonable prices, build your own and get everything you like on it or pick one of their combos. My personal favorite is the pear-fect pie which has pears, balsamic vinegar, and Gorgonzola cheese. The combo may sound gross (I thought it did, until I tried it) but it is AMAZING. You can get it half and half with something else too if you don't want to commit. All in all, 5 stars for food and the service has always been good and friendly. Wish there was one on the west side!!",

    "text": "Another new concept and this time it is one that actually works mostly. If you sign up for the text club, they will send you pizza discounts and this is when you should go get your pie. I had a $7 any pizza text and decided to give it a whirl. The thing that needs improvement is that they only have one oven and it looks like only three pizzas can fit into that said oven at once. If your pizza can't fit, it sits on the messy table (in my case only 3 minutes) and it waits and waits to enter the oven and when its busy who knows what can land on that pizza with the open air arrangement. Anyway, after the pizza my way came out, it ended up pretty good. The chicken needs some improvement and the meatballs are pork and beef combined (not a fan), but I like the fact that it is the same price for anything you throw on there. The staff is kind of young and goofy also, maybe someone who looks over 21 would give the place more respectability.",

It seemed too good to be True~ just to test them I went to town and selected 5 different toppings. The good stuff too like caramelized onions, grill chicken breast, some delicious hot peppers, portobello mushroom, ham on a wheat crust and sure enough it was around $10. Unbelievable!  My son had their ham and pineapple on white crust and he loved his pie!  The serve was quick and friendly and I loved the smell of freshly baked chocolate cookies. I saw them on many people's orders~ who can resist?!  This is a great place to come for casual dinners especially for families with picky eaters. You can make your own pie, just the way you like it without breaking the bank!  As mentioned in several of the other reviews, their HH is incredible. I haven't been here during HH but I'm looking forward to giving it a try!",

Its a close drive to home so its easy to drive by and grab some and then enjoy at home. The garlic knots are perfectly soft and prepared with right amount of olive oil, garlic, and basil. I usually have them add more parmesan on the end but that's because I'm a parmesan addict. I guess I should mention the pizza too being that this is a pizza place? I love the custom pizza options and the ability to venture out and try something new without having to take a vote on what others want -- because its your own personal pizza!

Two large glass garage style doors can be opened up to the patio when it's time to party.  The ingredients here are very fresh and are better than what you get when ordering delivery. They have 5 different sauces, 3 different crust types, and several different cheeses that you can select. They even have a gluten free version and some vegan options. Nice!  The pizzas are about 11\" and are cooked super fast in their very hot oven. It was fun to watch them make the pizza right in front of your eyes. They will build it however you want or you can go with any of their signature pies.  Had to try one of the Spicy Butcher Pizzas while the wife went with a Margherita with fresh mozzarella. They both came out in 10 minutes or less and were brought straight to the table. The tenderness of the crust and the perfect balance of toppings made it a yummy treat and tasty good.  They also have Starters, Salads, Sweet Tooths, and cool selection of Beers and Wines. Right next to Sprout's and in the same parking lot as Out-N-In. See ya there next time. CHEERS!  4.5 STARS",

    "text": "My Pie literally allows me to make MY Pie the way I want it, and as a vegan that means a lot.   My Pie is similar to Chipotle or Subway concepts where you pick your crust, your sauce, your cheese, then your toppings and they cook it in an oven that's like 850 degrees. You have your pizza in like three minutes and it's amazing and crispy.   It makes me super stoked that they have vegan crust, sauces, and cheese. The marinara is fabulous.   Another perk is the buy-one-get-one-half-price beers. Buy one for $4 and get a second one for $2. They have several local drafts and cans.   The location is in a shopping plaza but My Pie itself is pretty cool and modern with opening garage style doors to allow the patio and inside to combine.   The staff is always friendly and quickly work you through the line.   Best $9 you can spend!",

Although the pizza was quite good, the garlic knots were the real winner in my opinion and the marinara sauce included really complimented the garlic knots. The service was friendly especially the guy who was making my pizza at the time had a great attitude, forgot his name though.  If I didn't live so far from the location I would stop by more often, though I may have to try out the Tempe location sometime. They do have some deals going on every now and then so I'll probably come back at some point in time.",

I love being able to add as many toppings as I want for the same price, along with choosing my crust and sauce.   The guys behind the counter are always very friendly. The only issue is, it's not a 2 minute process. A lot of their marketing around the restaurant and on their website boast about it taking 2 minutes, not accurate. If you order a salad along with your pie, it could take 10 minutes, no exaggeration. It's still fast considering, and I can still get it to go, but it's not 2 minutes.",

The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave me outstanding recommendations.  I highly recommend the whole wheat crust.   The garlic knots are pretty good too.  Also they have a club where you get items for free after so many purchases and access to promotions that they send out.  Just for signing up I got a free cup of ice cream!

The idea behind this place is build your own pizza with as many toppings as you want for the same price... I can get down with that! I built a ridiculous pizza... wheat crust, spicy sauce, fresh mozz, ricotta, tomato, pears, caramelized onions, garlic, basil, spinach, and bacon..... ohhh yaa! It was good. Also, it was huge and I ate two giant lunches from the one pizza (probably could have stretched it to 3). Further, it was 9$. You heard me, 9$! I pretty much couldn't be happier. The people who work here were friendly, helpful, and patient with me (even when adding a zillion toppings). I would definitely come back if I were in the area!

This place makes really good pizzas fast, and the make-your-own concept is pretty simple: choose the kind of crust you want, then choose the sauce, the cheese, the topping, and finally the protein. All ingredients are displayed in front of you, which makes it easier to choose and  decide. You get the pizza a short time after ordering, thanks to the high heat of their oven. I chose a gluten-free crust, marinara sauce, mozzarella, peperocini, and pepperoni, and paired that pizza with a Grand Canyon pilsner. The pizza was so good (and having come from a gym workout, I was pretty hungry) that I ordered another pizza! This time it was a classic Margherita, and it was equally delightful. The guys staffing the place were really friendly, the pizzeria had a comfy dining space, and free WiFi completed the awesome pizza dining experience.",

It is also nice that you can get as many toppings as you like without a price increase so you never feel like you can't get what you want. It is recommended to get your own pizza but if you get a side or have a smaller appetite you can definitely share with one other person. It is also nice because if you aren't in the sharing mood or your boyfriend only like ONE topping, you can each get something you want.",

We ordered the My Uncle Nicky pizza, featuring Kurt Warner marina sauce, with sausage, fresh mozzarella and ricotta cheese. The pizza was so  delicious. Everything tasted so fresh. Our food came out super fast, this is a plus with our hungry toddlers. We got a free Caesar salad, that was also really fresh and the dressing was just right, not overly drowning in sauce. Staffs were friendly and attentive. The restaurant has a very cool decor and very clean. I'd would definitely come back here, and recommend family and friends.",

The fresh mozzarella was better here than the shredded mozzarella they offer.  I thought this place was going to have crumbled sausage (like I saw in Yelp photos) but it only had sliced sausage. I received free garlic knots for \"checking in\" on Yelp.  They also offer a program to receive points for free food. The customer service was great and it was easy to find parking.",

CHOOSE YOUR TOPPINGS tomatoes, mushrooms, fire roasted red peppers, red onions, garlic,fresh spinach, black olives, kalamata olives, pepperoncinis, jalapeno, green bell peppers, caramelized onions, pears, pineapples, artichokes  Pizza was just alright, nothing amazing.

I got the Spicy Butcher on wheat and added fire roasted peppers, and my wife made a custom pie with regular tomato sauce, pepperoni, caramelized  onions and ricotta on wheat. The pizzas were a decent size for a personal or to share between two people. The prices were reasonable, especially considering that you can add as many toppings as you want for free. My pie was quite tasty and piled high with toppings, and I especially loved the zesty spicy sauce. My wife's was also very good. We also shared a fresh baked chocolate chunk cookie and ice cream cup, and the cookie was warm and gooey. While we didn't get any drinks, the beer and wine were cheap, $4 with $2 refills. Overall, I was very impressed and will definitely go back.",
