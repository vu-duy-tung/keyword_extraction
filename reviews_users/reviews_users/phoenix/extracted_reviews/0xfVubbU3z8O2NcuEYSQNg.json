The monsoon roll was disgusting, the fish was tough and didn't taste good. The manager came over and did absolutely nothing. I work in a fish house with Grade A sushi, trust me the fish shouldn't feel like that. Also as a manger you should probably try and make the situation a little better than try and tell me the fish is suppose to be tough! If I would of eaten half the roll or even made a few pieces; but I had one, just one! The waitress barely checked on us and also blamed the bad roll on her being busy....horrible service and horrible sushi",

The food itself wasn't Tha great. My Fiance and I started with the shrimp tempura appetizer. The shrimp itself were the smallest shrimp tempura I've ever seen. The sauce that was given to us to dip the tempura was not tempura dipping sauce. The sauce given to us was just watered down soy sauce. For my lunch entree I got the L12 special,  which was beef and chicken teriyaki with corn, miso soup and a salad. The salad was fine. But it it pretty much went downhill from there. The teriyaki sauce used to make the dish, did not taste like teriyaki sauce. It was overly salty and overpowered everything.  Teriyaki is supposed to be balanced of sweet and salty. This was just salt. My Fiance was with me and she got the poke bowl. Which she said was very salty. I had a taste and it was even salter than my dish. The last thing I had was the miso soup. Which this was the one thing that was under seasoned. It was like a bowl of warm water with a hint of sea weed. In terms if food. This is probably one of the worse meals I've had in awhile. I'm giving them a 2 star, because the service wasn't bad.",

    "text": "Just like Yelp says, I have experienced better.  I came here late night with a friend after getting our ears pierced. Wasn't completely empty, but the staff had already begun closing up shop for the night. We were seated immediately. The waiter pretty much told us that we needed to order within the next five minutes or else the kitchen wouldn't prepare our food for us. We were there 45 minutes before the closing time.   Their rolls menu is a bit confusing, because it has one side with the prices for about 50 different rolls, and on the back there is a description for only about half of them. We ordered four of the rolls that were described on the back. Ended up going with the Las Vegas roll, Shrimp Tempura roll, Caterpillar roll and Spicy Tuna roll and miso soup to start.   The miso soup was very below average. It had a fishy taste, which was awkward and didn't smell pleasant. On the upside, it was steamy hot. The rolls came out about 15 minutes later and to be honest, I was not impressed at all.   The Las Vegas roll was smothered in some sort of sweet orange colored sauce which was very unappetizing on top of a cream cheese, avocado, and smoked tuna deep-fried contraption. The spicy tuna roll was not cold- rather lukewarm- and was not spicy at all. The caterpillar roll was actually pretty decent, but had more avocado on top than was necessary and not enough fish inside. The tempura roll was the best out of all of them- which says a lot about the quality of their food. The tempura around the shrimp was a little soggy, and this roll was also lukewarm which was very unappetizing.   The service was pretty bland, nothing special. Prices weren't bad either. We split the bill and paid about $20 bucks each, which isn't terrible for 4 rolls, 2 soups and 2 drinks.   Overall, I probably won't be back in the near future.   Pictures of the food are posted.",

I've had their gyoza and seaweed salad before, but would not recommend them. The gyoza especially was not that great. Even though it's happy hour the pricing is more than other sushi places I've been to for happy hour.  It's right by ASU, so they're very used to dealing with groups coming in and ordering. I've never had them mess up or forget some order in the big groups I've gone in with. Keep in mind they don't seat unless at least half of your group is there, so be careful if you have flaky friends or if you are they flaky friend.  My biggest negative is that sometimes it just feels a bit too dark and loud. It's not a very good place for a one on one date or conversation.",

    "text": "Sushi 101 was both a slight disappointment and a pleasant surprise. Lets start with this criticism sandwich with the tasty part, the $5 lunch special. For five bucks, I received a giant bento box filled with hot and fresh tempura veggies, a combination of thinly sliced beef and teriyaki chicken, a side salad with ginger dressing, miso soup, and a side of corn in a light soy dressing.  The tempura was top notch, crispy flakey batter and generously portioned. This was the best part of the box and and potentially worth $5 alone. I really felt like this was a steal to get all the classic japanese flavors for so little cash. The salad and corn were both fresh and well seasoned, but basic. I'll be back for their cooked items as long as they keep offering them at this price.  The downside was the sushi. The eel and avocado roll was stuffed with filler fake crab, and only the slightest bit of eel. What little eel made it in to the roll was fatty while the avocado was on the overly ripe side. This joint loves to put filler crab in a lot of their rolls so watch out. Spicy tuna was also underwhelming; not enough spice and the tuna was pulverized to a mushy texture. It was obviously overworked and was not pleasant. I prefer my \"spicy\" roll fish cut in to small cubes, and gently mixed with seasoning to preserve structural integrity and maximum flavor. The rice was also second rate, either there was not enough vinegar or a general lack of freshness. The sushi prices were reasonable, so I guess you get what you pay for,  Service was spot on, and our food came quick during a slow lunch hour. In a bizarre twist, they have an attractive wait staff and play Frank Sinatra. Check them out for their bento, and skip the sushi.  -3.5/5-",

And for the price I paid it should have been better.  I ordered mackerel sashimi (which I love and was super excited about), a couple rolls and veggie tempura.  The sashimi I ordered did not smell right.  I just couldn't stomach it so I fed it to my cat who loved it.  I added an extra star for him.  The rolls were okay but I asked for ginger and wasabi and got neither.  I didn't realize it until I got home and the rolls were bland without it.  The tempura was ok but kind of chewy and no longer crispy and there was no sauce for them.  I'm extremely disappointed and unless I'm willing to hop back in my car and go back to complain (I'm not) there's really nothing I can do about it beyond leaving this review.  I really don't think I'll go back after such a dismal experience.  Edit: the wasabi and ginger was included, hidden behind a plastic leaf and I didn't see it until I had finished the sushi.  I added a star because my stupidity isn't their fault.",

I usually sit at the bar.  The speed of service could be better as it always seems either the sushi chefs or the servers are complaining about working too many hours.  The variety on the all-you-can-eat menu is extensive enough for most nominal sushi-lovers.",

You can get $4.50 saki bombs during happy hour every day as well as half off assorted sushi.  Although it's not best sushi I've ever had it's well above similar places that compete for the budget sushi category.  You can easily stuff yourself for $10-$15.  Make sure to try the \"fantastic sauce\"!",

I love sushi and am usually a fan of anything that doesnt involve eel, but not this time. I actually was gagging after my second bite.  In hind sight, we should have left after commenting to each other that the place looked as if it had seen better days or when i realized that the gigantic plastic pudding cups that were set on our table were meant for soy sauce..... I guess thats what we get for going out on a limb. We did go to another favorite sushi restaurant instead.....after paying our (undebated) bill",

The only reason I stopped is because their sushi chefs either didn't care anymore or just didn't know what they were doing. No I am not a sushi snob but when your roll starts to fall apart on you as soon as you pick it up with your chopsticks, not a good sign. Like I said, I was a regular for awhile but something changed. I have been back maybe twice since last summer and its has been ok but just not the same. The owner is a sweetheart though.",

    "text": "Previous reviews make me think people must have really high expectations as far as price for quality sushi. I've been here twice and think the prices are great. They are equal to what I've paid at most places before, unless I was going out to a fancier place. Both times I've been there, I've had great servers. However, don't be surprised if you get an expensive bill after getting a few drinks. Their cocktails don't have happy hour prices, but their sake bombs are only $5.50 during happy hour. For that price, you get enough beer and sake for about 3 \"bombs\", which is a great deal. Sure, it's not the greatest sushi I've ever had, but I'm from Oregon where places can get significantly fresher fish, for obvious reasons.  Of all the rolls I tried, none of them were bad, but some were better than others. If you want a casual place to go on a date, with friends, or in a large group, I highly recommend Sushi 101. Definitely go during happy hour (4-7 and 9-close)...most of their basic rolls are only $3.50. Unfortunately, specialty rolls are still on the expensive side ($8.50-$12), but that's still a pretty good deal for a sit-down place and not crappy \"conveyer belt\" sushi places.",

I have been here a couple of times and usually sit on the left side of the sushi bar. The chefs are very friendly and make really good rolls. The presentation of the rolls are great. Sushi 101 is very Americanized - so if you want to have dinner at a traditional sushi restaurant, this place may not be the best place to go. However, the sushi rolls taste delicious. My waitresses in the past have always been friendly to me. I would have to say though, that rest of the waiters and waitresses in the restuarant were not very professional and the service wasn't the best. On some occasions, my empty water cups did not get refilled at all. Overall, I have always enjoyed my food and would go back but the waiters and waitresses need more training.",

Of most of the sushi restaurants I have been to, this place has one of the best happy hours so you can afford to try new items without breaking the bank. I have always had the same server who was very kind and served us well, but most importantly, I have always felt comfortable. Whenever I go to a restaurant, I have realistic expectations of how quickly food should be prepared and served. Sometimes this restaurant can serve you your order within minutes, and sometimes it takes a little longer. However, I am always very patient and whenever I go out, I like to relax as part of the restaurant experience. Therefore, the inconsistent serving time has never been a problem for me. Sometimes the wait to be seated can be long, so make sure to check this place out during slower business hours.",

When first walking in, there were crowds of people with drinks and it was difficult to even find a hostess. When finally reaching one, I put our name in for a table of three. She approximates a 30 minute wait which would have allowed us to receive the Happy Hour discount which ends at 7:00 pm. When we finally got seated at 7:02 the table wasn't even set up. We waited another 2 minutes for a third chair and another 10 minutes before a waitress even came over to introduce herself and take our drink orders. And 7 minutes later we got our drinks. I understand that I shouldn't base judgement on the waitress due to the crowds, however when we finally put in our food order we were told the sushi was going to take about 30-45 minutes before even coming out. I guess I'll post another review when we get our food.",

Their sushi and other foods are very tasty and are always of good quality. Their yakitori and gyzo are delicious, as is the squid karrage, and my favorite sushi rolls are the shrimp tempura, sakura, and the spicy salmon.  However when eating there the tables and space alway seem a little cramped but the atmosphere is nice for a dinner with friends. Also, the food can be pricey unless you go during happy hour (4-7) during which the prices are way reasonable. They also have good drink specials which include $5 sake bombs (with a 22 oz Kirin) and some beers that are $2.50-$3. However, the service can be quite slow, I've gone a few times where each person was getting one roll at a time and all at different times, so some people were done with their whole meal before some people had even received their first roll (even though everyone ordered at the same time). Sometimes the service is really fast but you just never know how it's going to be.",

We had seriously JUST missed happy hour, 20 minutes before we had gotten there, which sucks but it was still easy on the wallet. We got the Philly roll, Golden Gate roll, and the Spider roll. The Golden gate roll was GOOD! I would definitely recommend that. The Spider roll, not so much.. it was falling apart and seemed really dry. The philly roll was ok, you could taste mostly the cream cheese only. I am not sure if I would go here again, unless it was for happy hour. Oh yes, and we both had gotten dessert, which was sooo good! I tried the Banana tempura (amazing oh my god!!) and my boyfriend got the New York Cheesecake which was good from the one bite I had taken from it.

We tried what they called the Bob Marley roll it was delicious. The place was very chill, and staff was friendly and they were the ones who suggested we try those rolls. We really enjoyed our visit. They are now a top recommendation to anyone that' asks us about places to visit out here. Can't wait until the next time we are in the area to pay them a visit again. Oh and in terms of fresh sushi they score a 10! To not walk into the place and it has that fishy smell!! Loved the place!",

    "text": "It's with a heavy heart to say 101 is no longer our sushi of choice. Under new management or something they have decreased portions and now rely heavily on rice making up the vast majority of the rolls contents. This place used to be well above average and our go-to spot. More recently they have altered our favorite menu items and it's just no longer appealing. They used to serve 5-6 jalepanos with their orders, now it's 3. The price is the same. The rolls went from having a great balance to nearly 80-90% rice. I'm no review sniper or paid promoter but if you have a car then you're way better off going to sake bomber. Better service and now, officially, much better sushi and value. Hope this helps and good luck on your search for sushi.",

Over the summer, I went on my birthday and our orders got mixed up, the bill wasn't correct, et cetera (which is okay, mistakes happen). I'm writing this review now because I had even worse service last week when my food took over 40min. My boyfriend had already gotten and eaten all of his food before they brought my sushi out, and there were only 3 other groups seated in the restaurant! The waitress apologized in passing but at that point I was very hungry and frustrated, especially when it came to footing the bill as they took a while to bring that over, too. Food is still pretty great but they need to get better staff, and I'd have been happier if they had covered my ~$6 roll that came out so late (or at least thrown in a free appetizer while I was waiting and starving.)",

Cheap beers, reasonable rolls, just okay service.  It is practically on campus, so if you are a grown up, it might not be the place for you.  I like it well enough to have eaten here a dozen or so times in the past five years.  I always visited at happy hour, and have never had a bad experience like other reviews mention.  At a middle of the road place like this, I stick to standards:  Yellowtail Rolls (spicy or not, you pick) Salmon rolls Shrimp tempura rolls  Why mess around with anything more complicated than that?",

The fish is mediocre and only worth the price they are asking for when they run their happy hour. The drinks make the trip though. So if you are looking to have some drinks and a little sushi on the side, this would be a good place to go.",

    "text": "This was the last place on earth I expected to have the best sushi experience of my life, but it happened. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it's not something everyone's gonna be able to duplicate.  See, I like sushi without crap. No avocado, no cream cheese, no mayonnaise-based BS sauce. I like raw fish, vegetables, and the occasional citrus. I'm not going to Ra for a reason, basically. When I explained all of this to the waiter (who was hobbling around like James Caan in Misery), he told me to order the Heaven on Earth roll. I did it, sans avocado, and found a new favorite, instantly. They were also very amenable to my request for slivered onions soaked in ponzu sauce as a topping for my salmon nigiri. If you haven't tried that, btw, then do it. If you're allergic to salmon, then you did some bad shit in a past life.  The squid salad seemed a little off. I don't know what it is about it, but I've definitely had better, and it's not something I think I'll be ordering again here.  The Island Poki is delicious, but comes served as a salad with leaves, so I always feel bad about the waste if I'm by myself, and giving it to a date results in mixed results. Poki and lettuce shouldn't be mixed, I think.  The prices are reasonable (for sushi in AZ), about $35 w/tip to a pretty waitress (yes, that makes a difference) for Salmon Nigiri, HoE roll and a hand roll of spicy tuna with hot tea.  I've been for the oft-praised happy hour here, and while the price is good, the sushi is unremarkable.  All in all, this place has done me right, and I know I'll be returning.",

I came in and ordered the sushi combo (6 assorted nigiri and a Cali roll) I asked to switch to a spicy tuna not the Cali roll and was told there was an upcharge on the already $16 combo but whatever it's what I wanted and all the good specialty rolls were over priced. Also most places charge for changing combos and it was only $1 so nothing to hefty. The charge did include miso soup and a small salad. It was all bad.   The miso soup was way to grainy even when well stirred. The salad was bland except for the taste of bad tomato. The spicy tuna didn't taste anywhere near fresh or right. All the nigiri was just off on taste especially the eel which tasted like dirty water from a hose. And the salmon which was just bad. Another piece was chewy and hard to get down. Even the shrimp piece tasted old.   I will never come back here again. What used to be a close to campus option has sadly been beat out in taste and price by the sushi to go place in the Memorial Union on campus.   Save yourself some money an bad taste and go to cafe wasabi, sake bomber or ra if you need sushi around here.",

That being said, I've never had a bad experience at Sushi 101 and I've been here a LOT.  I used to work at a sushi bar with an absolutely insane owner. Contrary to the norm, sushi is the one food that you actually crave more of when you spend more time around it. When I worked at a bagel place, I didn't want to look at a bagel for years afterward. When I was working at this sushi place, I became some kind of sushi fiend. I wanted it ALL THE TIME.    However, as previously noted, the owner was a crazy person. He fired me twice, only to call hours later asking why I wasn't at work because it was getting busy. He constantly yelled at employees and accused everyone of stealing. We had the turnover of a Whitechapel whorehouse. Needless to say, this did not lead to me wanting to be at my job more often than absolutely necessary to pay my bills (and feed my new found sushi addiction).  So, I would go to work, make money, crave sushi, and then head to Sushi 101 for my fix.  As I've mentioned several times, I have no shame in my love for happy hour. If a restaurant has happy hour every day of the week, it would have to suck pretty hard for me to give it any lower than 4 stars. Sushi 101 has great happy hour specials on drinks, apps, rolls, and nigiri 7 days a week. Coda B. and I can usually have an all-out feast here for less than $50 (and we can put down some sushi).  The food is always good. Even though I don't know what good sushi is. It's all good to me, which means it must really all be bad, and I'm just not cool enough to have had the actual good sushi. Though I have had sushi in New York and LA and San Diego and at several very nice restaurants elsewhere. That was good too. But I'm not one to turn my nose up at salmon nigiri just because it only cost $2.50 and I ate it in a desert. BTW, their salmon nigiri is really really good. We almost always have to order more. And it's $2.50 and you don't have to drive to an ocean to get it. Which makes it even better.  The staff is full of ASU students, which should be expected given the location. They can get overwhelmed, but I'm a real easy customer when it comes to sushi so I've never had a problem with it. Those 22 oz beers keep me occupied for a while. The owner doesn't appear to verbally berate and/or fire-bomb (I made up that word, it's where you fire someone out of nowhere, preferably mid-shift) employees for no reason, so that's definitely a plus in my book as well.  Go during happy hour. It's a great value for good times and good sushi (even though I don't know what good sushi is).",

The selection is reasonably good, though many of the unusual names will have guests double-checking the menu to see what's in an ASU roll or a Wildcat roll.  The Bad: Consistency is NOT common here. I've had evenings where I was promptly seated by a smiling waitress and served delicious sushi within 10 minutes of ordering. I've also been seated and had to ask for service after waiting 15 minutes for a server to stop at my table (during a moderately busy night). During non-happy hour service the menu is considerably overpriced given the quality of the food, service, and dining experience.  The Ugly: The waitstaff are 70% inexperienced while 30% actually know what they're doing. After a poor dining experience I asked the waiter if he could do something to help make it right and was initially given a surly response. He did not offer a solution so I suggested waiving the charge on my appetizer (given that I'd waited so long for service after being seated). The manager did waive my $4 chicken karaage which I felt was appropriate given the poor service and disappointing quality of said appetizer.   If you go:  Go during happy hour or prepare to be overcharged. I strongly recommend trying the seared salmon nigiri and the sweet potato roll. Of my several visits there those have been 2 stand-out experiences in a selection of good, but not great, sushi.",

She was nice about it and took it off the bill. The sushi chef was somewhat nice, but kept telling me that that roll was the most popular. Really...people eat that crap? It tasted like butt. He asked me to put up my plate so he could take the rolls off. I'm wondering if they were recycled. It tasted like it was already made and sat in the fridge all day anyways, so who knows. The other roll I had was ok. It just didn't taste fresh. We'll see how fresh it was or wasn't tomorrow morning. If you know what I mean. ;o)",

I suppose by now I have a certain level of expectation from mid-continental sushi and I'm ok with the quality in AZ despite the distance from aquatic life (Tempe Town Lake doesn't count). While my bar here isn't high, this place wasn't on my list of places to check out. Sushi 101 was a very pleasant surprise. Their menu is diverse enough to appeal to those that like crap in their rolls i.e. cream cheese, those that like the classics, and those that are willing to explore some kind of happiness in between - me.  First of all, I was so impressed that they have more than 1 boring veggie roll. Who on earth offers 4 veggie rolls? This pleases me so. I was even more excited that one of them comes with jalapenos on top - yum! Secondly, the Sun Devil Roll is edible bliss and makes me wish I could carry around that spicy taste in my mouth for days.  I've only ordered take-out so I can't really speak to the atmosphere, but I love sushi so much that the environment I eat it in doesn't matter compared to the taste. The people that work there are pretty cool and it's about 2 miles away from home. Is this the BEST sushi in AZ? Is it the cheapest? No and no. But tasty and convenient enough to make the speed dial.",

When we walked in, the host directed us to a table to sit but rather than walking us there with menus, he just pointed and brought us the menus a few minutes later. It didn't seem malicious or rude - but definitely was odd and didn't give me a great first impression on the place.  We started with the edamame. It was pretty good. When it came time to order our entrees I asked my server what veggies came with the teriyaki bowl (I'm kinda picky). She responded with: \"You know, just the basic ones\". Eeep... I don't like negative reviews - but that doesn't seem like an effective way to answer my question. The conversation continued and I never really got to the bottom of my question. At one point I asked if there were mushrooms in it and she said: \"I think you should be good. Why? Are you allergic?\" No, not allergic - but if I was I hope she would go get a solid answer for me! She was a nice girl, and not rude, but just like the host I thought this was an odd way to treat a customer.   When our food came out it looked really good! I ordered the chicken teriyaki plate. I thought it was yummy but there was a whole lot of sauteed cabbage in there and not a lot of chicken! I will come back here because the prices were fair and they also have good happy hour specials!",

I walked in and the place isn't too big or small. Nothing really stood out to me. The waitress was very good in greeting us and getting our drinks.   I ordered the Spicy Chicken Yaki Soba with skinny noodles. It had cabbage, carrots, chicken, and green onions. Not bad. It had a nice kick to it. Not overly spicy but probably just right. My daughter had the Chicken Yaki Soba and it was exactly like mine but without the spice. She really did like her dish and gobbled it up.   As for my son and wife, they got the Raman noodle soup. It had everything in it. Cabbage, carrots, fish cake, chicken. They both thought that it was way too salty. So they didn't like it at all. This is why I was struggling on rating this place. It's really a 3 1/2 star.   We got all of our food before our sushi. We got the Rainbow and Dragon rolls. I thought they were sort of small but were very good. Enjoyed them. Liked the idea of presenting the rolls on tea leaves. Nice.   Overall the service was good. She kept our water glasses filled and kept on checking on us. Food was good and so so (little to salty for our liking). So since my wife and son are the Japanese food lovers, not sure if we will be back again. We'll see. Again 3 1/2 stars.",

Sushi 101 offers a full menu for him, and lots of vegetarian sushi options for me.   He loves the teriyaki chicken and rice platter. Always cooked fresh with yummy grilled vegetables.   I love the sweet potato roll and the asparagus tempura roll. Both come with avocado inside and are topped with crunch. SO delicious and definitely made fresh.   Most recently we had a waitress named Chelsea. She was super sweet and very on top of her game! We will definitely be asking for her from now on.",

My sister and brother-in-law recommended this place to me about 6 years ago when I came to visit. And we continue to come back.  Since we've been here so many times, we actually befriended the owner, who is so kind and accommodating. She even let me host my sister's bridal shower here and closed off a section for us.  You can't go wrong with happy hour here! Some of our favorites that we always order are the Roll 101, Palm Springs Roll, ASU Roll and the Volcano Roll. I highly recommend the Palm Springs Roll since it has some spicy tuna, a little crunch with the tempura toppings, and light feel. In terms of appetizers, I would definitely go for the spring rolls, which come with this nice citrus-type sweet dipping sauce, and my all time favorite, agedashi tofu!   Although I love the food and the owner, service can be hit or miss, but definitely coming on a less busy day/time will make you see how great of a place it is and how much I enjoy coming back here when I'm in Tempe.",

I got the Godzilla with jalapeno on top and it was absolutely delicious!!!! I also had a mojito and Gyoza, which were both really good.

And had no problem at all. But the problem for me is when my drink is empty. The server keeps walking by our table without noticing that my drink is empty. I tried to call him several times but he didn't notice me. When he finally noticed me and I told him what I want, his expression wasn't friendly at all. That moment we know we just need to leave and ask for the bill. Our server name is Bayan  (according to the receipt). WOW, WHAT A WAY TO RUIN MY BIRTHDAY!",

Unreal how terrible the service was, the waitress had a shaved half side of her head. She also added 20% gratuity for our party after giving such terrible service. Will never come back to this establishment.",

I was also pleasantly surprised to see vegan options (while I am not a vegan, your girl does like eating vegan at times!) I ordered the Vegan Tuna and it was really good, I believe it was a seasoned red pepper on rice but delicious none the less. We were there celebrating a birthday and service was awesome, for your birthday you have the option of $10 gift card or a free dessert. I will definitely be back soon.",

It beats out the nearby RA in the accessibility column since you don't have to deal with parking on Mill.   101 has a good happy hour and a solid selection of rolls to choose from. It's not too expensive but you get what you pay for. I find it to be somewhat bland at times.   That being said, it's perfect for the college aged to get together with a group friends for some affordable sushi. You can't beat that location if you are living near/on ASU campus.   Go Devils",

They have many items on happy hour, yes, but there is hardly any discount!!! You can get a $12 roll for $11 or a $14 roll for $12.. Like that's it? 1-3 dollars off?  Our server was something else! I wish I knew her name, I don't even think she told us what it was. She was dark haired with heavy eye liner and a Harry Potter  dragon tattoo on her forearm. We were all wondering why she was being so short and rude. She literally had the dirtiest look on her face and acted miserable. When the checks came out we learned that she added a 20% auto gratuity to all of our tabs. If this restaurant cares anything about their customer service reputation I think they should remove the auto gratuity because it encourages servers to be lazy/rude/etc.",

You have friends who are willing to pay $8-$12 for a roll of sushi. 2. You have friends who have $20 to pay for two rolls of sushi. 3. You have friends who won't complain after paying $20 for two rolls of sushi.  When I was in college, I didn't meet criteria #1 and #3.  Sushi 101 is cheap during happy hour. That is why I will keep this restaurant close to my heart. It's the only place where you and a friend  can purchase ridiculous amounts of sushi for $24 during happy hour. I had a lot of good times here and this restaurant is definitely worth 4 stars!",

This trip was my most recent one and will forever be my last.  I am a huge sashimi fan. I ordered my usual salmon sashimi, but when it came out not only were their pieces tiny for the high price, I even found some dark splotches on it. After looking at them I quickly lost my appetite.

The ordering system is a little tricky when you first go there (you have to mark your order on a card,) but the wait staff is always super personable and happy to help you out, as well as explain what is in some of the more obscure rolls.  I reccommend going during one of their happy hours (my personal favorite being the 9 PM - close) and getting a sake bomb--$5.50 for a huge bottle of Kirin and warm sake. And they don't yell at you if you do the obnoxious but fun pound-on-the-table sake bomb setup. If you are a semi-lightweight like me, that $5.50 will get you a great head start on your night out. During happy hour, you can easily get fed and drunk for about $20 a person, with leftovers to take home.  To be honest, I have only ever ordered sushi rolls and edamame here. All the specialty rolls are delicious and huge--don't be turned off by the price, they pile tons of crunchy and savory extras on top of many of their rolls. The wasabi and ginger are also perfect.  Atmosphere is good. Nice decor, and the music is generally something that suits my taste. Can get a bit loud, but what do you expect from a place that's right next to ASU? My only gripe about this place is that the patio is kind of loud because it faces the intersection, so I never sit out there.",

It says on the menu it comes with a ponzu sauce but that never seems to be with it.  They smashed the wasabi and ginger together in a little sauce cup, which might not bother anyone else but I hate ginger so I don't like it anywhere near my wasabi or sushi...  I like the crab puffs, parts seemed over done and parts seemed under done so it seems like they didn't turn it / pay attention while they were cooking, but otherwise they're good.  The veggie tempura is okay - I'm used to fluffier/flakier tempura and better tasting sauce... but it's not bad.  (I can't comment on the atmosphere or location as I get food from Sushi 101 by delivery.)  Also, they did a good job of following my special instructions, which in my experience is rare.

The place was about half full, and as other reviews have noted, in the middle of a lengthy nightly happy hour.  It was about 6PM and we were prepared to be patient.  The server was prompt and friendly, and we ordered drinks and an edamame appetizer.  A few minutes later, we ordered two rolls apiece to share, for a total of four.  Drinks and edamame came shortly.  The edamame was so-so.  Then it was time to wait.  And wait.  And wait.  The server checked in one time to apologize for the delay and he assured us our food would be up soon.  And then we waited some more.  And waited.  After an hour, you start to feel like you've been had.  Other people who were seated after we ordered had already been served (not sushi, however).  I finally caught the server and told him we were leaving.  He seemed genuinely surprised by this, and I told him we had been sitting for over an hour.  Eventually, he came back with the check and said the sushi was still not ready, so they took it off the bill.  Generous...considering the level of inconvenience we had experienced.  I ended up paying $12 for two non-alcoholic drinks and a cup of tasteless edamame - plus an hour of my life.  Customer Service 101: why not void the entire bill to make up for the situation?  We didn't argue and it would not have mattered in any event.  We will not be back.",

We stumbled upon this sushi place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Not only was the food delicious, our server, Davin was super helpful not only with menu recommendations but with some nightlife options to do around the area.  A+++ sushi rolls we ordered: * Cheetah  * Monsoon Roll * Grizzly Bear  * Diamondback - per recommendation  And of course, dessert - 101 Brownie. Delish!  Date Visited: 2/23/18",

    "text": "When a fellow vegan told me about all the vegan options here, I couldn't wait to check them out. We're not talking an avocado roll here or a tofu salad there. No, no. They offer a nice variety of vegan sushi rolls; 9 vegan rolls are featured on their menu. Vegan appetizers include spring rolls, tempura vegetables, and a few other options. If it's written in green, it's vegan. (Also, the eel sauce is vegan.)  The Springs Rolls were fried to a golden brown and were deliciously crunchy. Not all sauces are created equal, but I love their sweet and sour dipping sauce. The Veggie Tempura was ok.   My favorite roll is their Lotus Roll. Made with asparagus tempura, avocado, and mango (I omit the cucumbers), this is a tastebud tantalizing dish.   If you enjoy a little spice, try the Gardenfire Roll, which consists of jalapeno, peppers, & Sriracha. It is a hearty roll that is sure to light your fire!   I also got a side order of their fried rice (sans egg to make it vegan. Also note how the word \"egg\" is written in black, not green) and surprisingly, it was some of the best fried rice that I have ever had outside of my hometown. I was very impressed.   They have happy hour every day from 4pm-7pm, and from 9pm-close. Happy Hour prices for appetizers and sushi rolls are written in red on the menu, so there's no guesswork here.",

The service was again slow, and the food took a while to arrive. But then again, the food is worth the wait. I'm sure they have to prepare precisely that can't be rushed and I understand.

My sushi was extremely over priced and I didn't even drink! Happy hour is meh. Most importantly the sushi was not made with quality ingredients. The sticky rice on the California roll was so sticky it was like glue. The ends of the Vegas roll were basically fried hokey pucks. The cream cheese disgusted me it was old and sour. Each component of the sushi must be flavorful fresh and balanced. I will not be back here!",

I ordered the Lotus Roll, Baked Tofu Roll and the Gardenfire Roll.  The Lotus roll was the best of them all in my opinion, the mango is a fantastic addition.  The Gardenfire Roll was good, packed some good heat.  The Baked Tofu Roll was very bland compared to the other. Still good, but I love avocados and they make everything better to me anyways.   A bit pricey, but most places like this are. Would eat here again.",

The only downside was that the server was unsure of which rolls were vegan, so we had to ask a few staff members to clarify. It seems that most of the vegetarian rolls are vegan, and the tempura is cooked in the same fryer as the fish so be mindful of that. Parking was easy in the big lot. Sushi took a little while to prepare, and it was 100% worth the wait. Appetizers came out quickly, so order those too if you're hungry.",

We had already knew what we wanted, made the order clear and concise, but she seemed irritated to have to hurry.  The biggest issue my party and I had while there was that, after a problem wtih my order (she ordered the wrong roll), she ignored our table for the rest of the time we were there until my new order came out!  When I told her my order was not correct, she made it clear that she would have to pay for the mistake--I'm sorry it is coming out of your paycheck, but you made the mistake in the system!  She did not refill our drinks the entire time we were there, and made me feel as though the mistake was my fault.  All she could do was split the price of the roll that I had not wanted, which I dont understand why a restaurant would have that policy, instead of just clearing it from my tab.

    "text": "Sushi 101 has decent sushi. I think they could have more flavor, but their rolls definitely aren't bad. I've also had their lunch special with teriyaki chicken. The vegetables on that plate were done well because they had just the right amount of crispness left. Flavor on the chicken was slightly more sour than your typical teriyaki, but not bad. Overall, it's a decent place to get sushi, but I do think I've had better.",

    "text": "Perhaps because this is close to ASU they think no one will notice the quality of sushi. Because students run in and out or do take out perhaps no one bothers to say anything. But the reality is for people that enjoy good fish, soft rice and dont mind spending the extra few $$ for quality this is not the place for you. I always think of this place as \"fast food sushi\"..It comes out fast but I ALWAYS feel something is either missing or wrong. If I am in the area and with friends and they want a low cost sushi experience I will go but then I do simple rolls that are harder to screw up. Not the worst, not the best..but maybe just right for the students that visit the most.  ps. I dont live close so I dont go for happy hour. This review is based on non happy hour service. From reviews it is clear they put a lot of effort into alcohol and happy hour. Perhaps after 2-3 drinks the fish tastes better or the price makes it worth while to come back.",

Is the sushi the best around? Nah.  Are their regular menu prices that great? Meh.  Is the service good?  Usually.  Am I in love with their happy hour? YES.  I love sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with the guys making my yummy food.  They are always friendly and good for conversation.   I recently hosted a Meetup event here and everyone had a great time.  We had about 20 people on the patio.  Service was great and they were very accomodating.    I'm in love with the Godzilla Roll!",

To be fair, the order was ready and the employees were nice.  However, when i got home, the four different rolls i tasted were bad. Again, the same stinky smell followed me home through the order. The rice was old and tasteless. I urge you to taste this place well before you have a party if you are going to use their services. Even the California roll I ordered was really bad. I never thought anyone could make that one bad.  I hope it was this bad because it was on a Sunday because i am typically a happy reviewer.",

    "text": "Let me just start by saying I loved Sushi 101 until tonight. My friend and I came in and were ready to leave after our dinner when the server came up and told us their system was down and it would be a few minutes until it was up. 50 minutes later, no ones telling us what's going on, the server is just apologizing repeatedly. Other people simply got fed up & left. My friend & I both work in a restaurant so we understood & were nice, even too nice, about the situation. After almost an hour, we wanted to leave & asked our server what was going on. She told us it still wasn't working & then she grabbed my card & began writing my card number down on a random piece of paper telling me they'll just charge me later... Very illegal. I politely told her I was not okay with that to which she responded by huffing & storming off & complaining to a coworker about 4 feet from us. We could see the entire staff & manager arguing & our server crying in the back. The manager told her to write our card numbers down to which she screamed that I won't let her. I tried to speak to the manager but he had his back turned to me & wouldn't turn around. Our server came back & we told her we had to leave to which she yelled at us & told us we weren't leaving without paying as if we were not trying to pay her for the past hour. I felt extremely disrespected & treated as if I was trying to skip out on the tab. She finally took our card numbers down through some old paper system & gave us the paper to sign and rudely said \"you don't even have to tip me\" and then left the paper on the host stand, with our card information in plain site. I would have tipped her, very well, even with the entire system being crashed if she hadn't been completely rude to us. As an employee of a very professional restaurant, I was shocked. The server was so disrespectful, we could see the entire staff screaming at each other, and at the end of the day no manager came to apologize or discounted anything or even said a word. Shame on you sushi 101, the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.",

To be honest, I thought the chicken was precooked and reheated/sauced to order. The rice was hard and dry as well. My husband order a plate of albacore again. The pieces were much thinner than last but he said it tasted good. He mentioned that kabuki restaurant definitely gives more for the money than sushi 101. I don't think we will be coming back.

Not because there was too much food, but because it was hard keeping it down.  Why two stars? Well the service was great, as were their miso soup and green tea.

    "text": "*First, I have to get this off my chest. I am a consistent patron of this sushi bar, and it gets annoying seeing so many people give flack to Sushi 101. I have brought many a friend here, and it's created many sushi lovers....Believe me, I am a witness! Is it the highest quality fine grade-A sushi you will ever have? No. Can I say this is the best place for sushi, don't go anywhere else? NO! Is it an amazing and price-efficient way to learn how to sushi, and let you try things before you branch out? YES! As a foodie, a native Phoenician and a proud Sun Devil Alumni, I definitely take issue to those who cast patrons off as slack-jawed kids.*  OK, I feel better. The 101 is a treat if you are a Sun Devil or even a local Tempe resident. They have all the generic types of sushi and have some of the best happy hour deals in town. I can't tell you how great it feels to know you can get a big ol' Sake Bomb with your friends and not freak out about prices. You get what you pay at happy hour, which they have two of. It allows everyone ample time to get out and enjoy their sushi at a good price. Also, one thing rarely utilized here is their lunch specials, which are amazing. I took advantage of this once, and if you think the deals at happy hour are good, their bento boxes are killer.   The quality is where 101 takes its flack, and rightfully so. But for the most part besides a couple dishes (mainly spicy salmon), you should expect to have excellent tasting sushi The special rolls they make are also great, and can play to a variety of pallets.  For these deals, I give it 4 stars. Its probably more deserving of 3 1/2 *'s, considering quality, but adding in the amount of daily happy hour considering other local sushi restaurants, this takes the cake. I definitely suggest you branch out besides here, we do have some great sushi bars here in AZ, but this is an awesome deal if you're in the Tempe area and want some sushi.",

This is the WORST sushi I have ever had.  I would rather eat the stuff from Kyoto Bowl.  In fact, in comparison Kyoto bowl sounds rather delicious to me at the moment, that is if you didn't turn me off from sushi altogether.   Happy hour schmappy hour, I can't believe people pay to eat this crap.    On top of that the service was awful.  I had a beer and finished it not half way into my time there and was never asked if I wanted another.   After that I find on my bill they factored gratuity into my tip.  The only time I know this to be a common practice is for groups of 6 or more. There were five of us.  I think they have to build in the tip because they know they are awful and wouldn't make any money otherwise.  College kids, I know you don't have much money but trust me, there are plenty of decent or even great sushi places out there that offer amazing HH deals.   I cringe to think of how many kids will have their first sushi experience here and will never know how truly delicious and amazing sushi actually is.",

    "text": "(I'm downgrading my rating to three stars this entry...) I enjoyed Thursdays' dinner so much, I came back the following night and ordered the miso soup and two rolls.  Even though I was hungry, I hardly touched the soup as I found it too salty.  Unless I'm craving for something warm and salty next time, I don't think I'll be having the soup again anytime soon, even if it is complimentary...  Tonight (Friday, 4/10), I tried two rolls off of the happy hour menu- the Philly roll and the Baked salmon roll.  Both were delightful, and I would certainly order them again!!  The Philly roll contains smoked salmon, cream cheese, and cucumber.  The baked salmon roll consists of baked salmon, krabmeat, cucumber, and avocado, and rolled with crispy panko crumbs.  Mmm!!  I'm very happy with Sushi 101!  My only complaints are that 1.) on my last three visits, I noticed that the sushi (vinegared rice) isn't as tangy (?) or as texturally-satisfying as it used to be, and 2.) I'm afraid to sit anywhere but the sushi counter where I know I can get the best service from Tots [short for Tatsuya  (sp?)].  Tots usually works with two other chefs on each side of him (tonight there were four behind the counter).  The one to his left NEVER smiles; He actually looks like he despises working there.  I usually sit in front of Tots' section, but there wasn't any room there for me tonight, so I sat in front of the unsmiling, surly-looking chef, and not once did he even make eye contact with me.  Not even a hello to open up a dialogue or to even acknowledge my presence.  When I mentioned to him that I had a couple of rolls picked out (I was hoping he'd make eye contact so that I could tell him about my food allergy concerns), he just said, without looking at me, \"just put it there,\" and pointed to the counter ledge in front of him.  After the list had been sitting there while he was still busy making other rolls (and more orders were coming in with him taking those orders without looking at mine), I finally shouted out to Tots' if it would be best that I hand him my order since he already knew my food allergies.  The surly chef, without looking at me, took my order slip and handed it to Tots and told him to take it.  Very rude and unprofessional.  (I'm definitely going to have to speak to the owner/manager next time I go back.)   Don't know why Yelp won't let me update my reviews here, so that I can downgrade the rating to reflect the poor customer service skills of this particular chef.  Otherwise, I'm happy with a venue that is very accomodating to their guests who suffer from food allergies!  --- (Four-star rating for this entry...)  Thursday's (4/09) dinner consisted of miso soup (complimentary if sitting at the sushi counter) and veggie tempura ($3) off of the happy hour menu; the Lobster Dynamite off of the regular menu; and Thursday night's special, the Spiny Caterpillar.  I'm finding that the more I try their miso soup, the less I like it; Soup was very salty, and I probably left about 2/3 untouched.  Veggie tempura, which we specially ordered to consist only of zucchini and sweet potato was good, but the potato needs to be cooked a little longer.  The spider roll was OK, but it couldn't compete with the dinner special, the Spiny Caterpillar.  Usually consisting of soft-shelled crab, crabmeat, avocado, and cucumber rolled in rice wrapped with nori paper and then topped with unagi (eel), I ordered ours with asparagus and taking the place of avocado and cucumber.  The Lobster Dynamite was the hit of the night, however; the usual california roll (though ours had substitutions), rolled in crispy panko, then topped with baked lobster with spicy cream sauce!!  We savored every delicious morsel!!  As usual, I always forget to take pics when Mom is around, so forgive the pics included.  A couple of young men nearby had two identical dishes that looked so enticing that I had to be nosy and ask them what they were called.  One immediatly said \"Krazy Maki, and it is awesome!\"  Mom and I decided right then and there that we were going to order that the next time we came in.",

The grizzly has a spicy kick at the end of eating a piece. Splendid!!  Not too much spice either as I'm not a big spice person. ASU is just amazing as there really are no words for how good it is!!!  Tried the Q Maki which was refreshing. The monsoon and sun devil roll are good too. I will definitely be back as I want to try their whole sushi menu as they have a great variety!!  This will be my new go to sushi place. The manager Garrison is super nice, hospitable and friendly. Sometimes the wait staff is a bit slow to come to your table, but the sushi is worth coming back for minus the lag time in the servers. Melt in your mouth sushi!  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  I hope it stays around for a long time!!!",

I can't believe I paid for that.   The miso was nasty as well. Too many onions and the seaweed used in the soup was nasty. I'm always up for miso soup, but I will never eat anything like what they put in front of me ever again.  Plus, the service sucked. I'm sorry that I came in a weird hour (right about 2:30 pm), but why take a table if you are not going to stay for them? I have to say though, that I am kind of grateful that we ended up with a different server. The second one was actually nice--but couldn't even pronounce the words correctly.   To top it off, they wear shirts that say \"Miso Hungry,\" but one guy was walking around without the \"ry\" attached so it stated, \"Miso Hung.\"   Yeah. I'm never going here ever again.",

I hadn't eaten anything else and I'm 100% sure it was the fish. I made the mistake of ordering a chefs special... which in hindsight was a roll with fish that was probably going bad and they wanted to push it. I'll never go back here. I hope this places closes.

His selection is proof that college kids will eat anything, especially if someone else is paying for it.  I will say that service was friendly and prompt.  However, the food is mediocre.  The rolls, for example, were completely flavorless.    The bento box that our nephew selected had a plentiful supply of food.  It, too, was rather tasteless, however.     There are several restaurants in the area, so perhaps you might try something else.   Also, this is a very travel congested area, and parking is a real challenge if you are driving, as we were.",

Over all perfect service from her!   The spicy garlic edamame was delicious! Loved their seasoning.   My new favorite is their \"mango tango\" roll, I tend to order the same thing every time but I'm glad I got something different. The roll had mango and avocado on the outside and a small drop of hot sauce, I'm assuming Sriracha, inside was smoked salmon, cream cheese and I think one other ingredient. The mix of flavors was phenomenal. Highly recommend.   Awesome experience last night :)",

They were all good, no complaints there. Beer was cheap too. We all enjoyed our time there. They also have outdoor seating, but we opted for inside and got a big round table in the middle of the restaurant - not complaining.   Does it cost to order extra wasabi? I was confused.",

    "text": "First of all, this rating is mainly based on the food and as 2 stars is described above as \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" is just the perfect description. I came here with a group on a Monday night and it was pretty empty. It was happy hour which I was excited for only to learn that the happy hour prices were not your typical half off -- it was merely 1 or 2 dollars off, maybe 3. Pretty disappointing if you ask me. I gave them the benefit of the doubt that their food must be pretty amazing if they won't shave off much for happy hour but I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad (regular price $13, happy hour price $12)... which did nothing close to blowing me away. It was lettuce, carrots, avocado, with lightly seared-on-the-sides ahi tuna. I kept waiting for the flavor to pop in but it just didn't do it for me. I gave them another chance to redeem themselves by trying my friend's sushi roll. I'm not sure what it was called but it was basically a California roll with a piece of unagi on top. And like the salad it was just OK. It wasn't the freshest I've ever had and with the abundance of more decent sushi/Japanese places around the valley, I probably would never choose to come to Sushi 101 again based on the food. The service I must say was fantastic - our girl was very sweet and accommodating. She even didn't hesitate to take our photo for us until we were satisfied with it. I liked her enough to leave her additional tip on top of the added gratuity for our party.",

A 2 bucks for edamame. 5 bucks for sake bomber with a huge beer and a seemingly never ending container of sake (not actually never ending).   And I haven't even mentioned the Sushi. The happy hour makes a lot of the rolls really affordable (3$ California roll) and the quality and taste is decent. They do tend to take a while and they will bring out whatever is ready first so it may be a few minutes for your friend to get theirs but that just means you have more time to chat and drink sake.   Saying all this I don't know if I would come here when it's not happy hour but the good news is they have happy hour and reverse happy hour so almost every time you go you will be there at the right time.  Had numerous early nights out with my friends here at happy hour and always had a good time. Would recommend it for any group of friends or couples that want to drink, chat and have a good time.",

First off there was only one sever on knowing that happy hour was in a half hour so it took bout 20 minutes to take our drink order we ordered food cause if it took that long to get our drink order then better not risk it.  So we finally got our two rolls to hold us up till happy hour after 15 min happy hour rolled around and we ordered two more rolls so we kept waiting for 35 min the manager comes out and says \"sorry bout the wait your order must of not got rung in but it's getting g made and we will buy you dessert\"so I was no worries sounds good to me.which I thought finally we get our two rolls we ordered and a quail shooter the waitress said \"I think the cooks are mad cause they had to make the order\"so with that being said I tell you with a honesty and truth that one of the rolls was wrong and one had a hair in it thankful that it was visible cause if I would of ate it I would of threw it up  We got the sever she got the same manager on duty that spoke to us about the dessert he came to our table I showed him the hair and note that I have a shaved head he looked at me like I was crazy he said \"I'm sorry I can remake it for you and take care of your dessert\"I looked at him like are your serious would you want to eat anything after you found a hair no I don't want anything to eat so he took off the two rolls and tried to charge me for the quail shooter that I did not eat I don't ask for anything I just don't come back but on this situation I thought maybe he would comp the bill but he looked at me like I was in the wrong and may I mention I was in the food and beverage for more the twelve years from busser,host,sever all the way to kitchen manager so I know great service I would not feed you anything I wouldn't myself or family and friends I didn't even want to give sushi 101 even 1 star i just won't ever go back out all places I have eaten this was the worse experience ever I made it a goal to myself to write this review even tho I never complain I just had to on this that's how bad   Sushi 101 did me so thank you for losing me a customer I used to be fond of this place and the manager there needs to work on customer service or ya just don't care",

This is not a place for those seeking ambiance or romance.  It's a just a place for okay sushi and cheap drinks.  Based on the location, it seems to appeal more to the college crowd.

I definitely  LOVE their spring rolls and I think it's a MUST to try, the accompanying  sauce is just amazing.  I like most of their rolls except for the new spicy octopus (dunno why they changed the way the used to make them!!) but I don't think they're only worth more than the happy-price due to the size and the use of imitation crab.  I'm not a big fan of their yakitoris as it always came dry and had that taste that made me thing it was pre-cooked.  Bottom-line, will I go there again? YES.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner at Sushi 101 on Saturday. We got there at around 8 and were seated immediately. When we reviewed the menu, we realized that we missed the happy hour by 1 hour and were 1 hour early to the second one which starts at 9:00pm to close. We were in the mood for sushi so I ordered 5 sushi rolls, all from the cooked options. My husband also ordered edamame for an appetizer. We also ordered 1 coke and 1 water.   The edamame came out super fast. I didn't have any. It's my husband's favorite, not really mine. We waited for the food for a long time before our waitress came up to us and said that the kitchen was behind and asked us if we wanted to order an appetizer while we waited. We ordered vegetable spring rolls. Almost as soon as we placed our order, the sushi rolls started coming out!    The lollipop, the dragon and the \"scallops\" were our favorites out of the 5.  Both my husband and I found the lobster shrimp roll and the other role bland and didn't have much flavor.   The spring rolls were good and were crispy. They were served with a dipping sauce that was unusual but tasted pretty good. They were on the smaller side and the basket had 4 of them.   When we completed our meal and received our bill, I was somewhat disappointed that we were charged a full price for the appetizer. If the kitchen is behind and we have to wait for our order, a lot of times, restaurants offer something on the house. We didn't expect that but we would have appreciated at least the happy hour price for the appetizer. We had to wait for around 25 minutes for our rolls to come out.   A good restaurant for sushi with a lot of menu options but I would go there only during happy hour in the future.",

Our server was phenomenal and I was crazy thirsty but also tend to drink a lot of water when I eat sushi with soy sauce. He did such a great job keeping my glass full and was super hospitable with my husband whenever he needed something aka extra ginger.   The food was spectacular! The calamari and the sourish sauce it came with was by far the best I've had in a sushi joint!! The edamame came out great, not too squishy & the rolls were spot on fantastic! Will certainly be coming back!! Only complaint is the AC was cranking and it was actually pretty cold... and I'm from Mn so that's saying something!",

You are immediately greeted and sat wherever you'd like to sit. I have been here on two separate occasions and I sat at the regular bar and then we sat at the sushi bar. Both were really nice and clean. The sushi chef's were talkative and seemed to enjoy their jobs because they were constantly smiling and seemed very genuine about it.  I ordered 2 rolls, the spicy krab roll and the salmon roll. I also got it with eel sauce, and ordered a shirley temple. I got all this delicious food for just under $17.00.

    "text": "Met a couple of friends here on Saturday night and enjoyed myself. I got there a little bit later than my friends so they had already ordered. I checked out there rolls and had a few and they were delicious. Not overly spicy or salty and just good. I decided to order their philly roll as I wanted something super light.   I love that they have reverse happy hour--even on Saturdays! Unfortunately it does not include their mixed drinks, so I decided to get an ace pear pineapple cider. It was very refreshing and went great with the roll.   My friend ordered their chicken with vegetable teriyaki bowl that looked and tasted amazing. It had large chunks of broccoli, onions, scallions, and chunks of chicken on top of a bed of thick noodles. I had a few bites and I was super impressed. I actually wished I had ordered one of their bowls versus the sushi rolls. Their bowls were only $12 and could have easily been two or three meals. I definitely plan on come back here and get one of their bowls. I have been sleeping on this place for years!",

He was cutting off my friends when they tried to explain what happened ... we even have photos of the chicken , I also tasted the rice and noticed that I was chewing raw chicken... this saddens me bc I love this place ... the manager did comp the dish but the way we were handled was not cool. We all are entrepreneurs who do PRETTY well for ourselves so we don't need to scam anyone and the way we were talked to was unacceptable and condescending.",

I ordered the Salmon dynamite roll $8 and Squid salad for $4.50.   I expected the Salmon dynamite roll to have lots of salmon in it, but inside the roll was all crab imitation meat and a large amount on the top of the roll was also crab imitation meat with crumbs of crunchy salmon on the top.  The squid salad had a descent amount of seasoning on it. After I took two bites I noticed about a 2cm hair on one of the squid pieces. I mean I know it happens so I asked the server for another one. Keeping my fingers crossed that it didn't have more hair.   A few minutes later Natalie was eating her Las Vegas Roll and Lemon something roll, I noticed that the last piece of sushi had a piece of long hair on it. After that my appetite was lost.   We notified the server and she apologized. She said that the two dishes were made in different kitchens. Uhmm, maybe they should be wearing hair nets.   I still paid for my squid salad but she took the roll off Natalie's bill.   Yeah definitely not my choice to go for sushi now.",

They'll charge you leftover fees, which was a flat $5 regardless of how many rolls you ordered the last time I was here, but sometimes you'll get a nice waiter that will take away rolls with 2-3 pieces left and not charge you. Apparently the policy has changed and also changed so much that managers will watch you eat on the cameras and also count how many pieces your waiter takes away from you. I was charged $30 in \"leftovers\" and I didn't even know this was a rule. Management has their priorities to making sure they watch you on the cameras to  overcharge you instead of making their food better. The sushi and food are overpriced and mediocre. Somewhere else deserves your money more.",

I came to a blank at the complete name but its the only one with Geisha in it :) I used to love the Golden State roll and I get it from time to time I think I love Sushi 101 based off of the great food, good drinks, and all of the memories my friends and I have had...

    "text": "Sushi 101 was a favorite of mine but it has become completely overpriced! Their sushi happy hour special are just a $1 off. Like really? I was shocked when I saw this because I do not remember it being like that.   Most of their worthy rolls are $10-$12 DURING happy hour!  Let's just do the math for this. You buy a roll that's $11 that contains 8 pieces of sushi, that's about $1.37 per piece! And for this price it's definitely not worth it since it's not like it tastes amazing or anything.   Next time I'm at ASU and I'm craving sushi, I'll just go somewhere else.",

I pay for what I get so I'm not terribly dissapointed with how average the sushi is. But when you're drinking, who cares that much, anyway? (I don't.)

The nigiri are always fresh, generous portions (spicy scallop...omg).  The service is always fantastic. Who I am assuming is the owner (she looks the part if you know what I mean) is always up front to greet with a big smile. The servers and managers are very attentive and nice, also.   The happy hour prices are amazing! I usually sit down (with Georgeann G.) to a meal of three rolls, four nigiri, and an appetizer and the bill is always a reasonable amount (usually around twenty each with tip). If you were to go in and keep it to one roll and one nigiri you could easily spend less than ten dollars.  The scenery is always great too. There's a really great vibe about this restaurant with all the young college life around in the heart of ASU.   I'm a big fan and I'm sure most would be... definitely a great place to check out.",

Well, perhaps you want a pretty central area to meet friends for lunch or after work. Or maybe it's the middle of the weekend and your jonesin' for sushi. Then, go. But otherwise, don't. I mean, really, with a name like Sushi 101, you can expect it to cater to ASU kids and residents down the block. Hey, no biggie, right?  If I were you, I wouldn't bother, though.  Service is good, although during a lunch visit once, I felt almost hurried out the door when all I really wanted was to enjoy my hour break, settle back into the booth and savor each bite. Seems that was too much to ask, for the check came long before 1/2 my roll was eaten. To me, that reeks worse than rotten fish.",

I haven't experienced any items with an overtly bad odor, but sometimes I'll get a piece of fish with a 'this should've been served yesterday' texture. The pricing and usually the service are pretty good.  Also, there is a full bar here with happy hour and reverse happy hour and signs all over the place for their pitcher special and I'm not really sure why 4 people previously entered that this place serves no alcohol. There's plenty available if you need it.  By the way, just an observation from my latest visit, if I pay a $14.00 tab with a $20 bill, does it really need to be said that I will not be able to leave a decent 15-25ish% tip if my change includes a $1 bill and a $5 bill?",

The location is pretty nice as well, conveniently located around the heart of tempe, and pretty close to ASU as well.  The interior is decorated \"asian\" style but it has some quirkiness to it as well.  There are two main areas to dine, one is by bar and the other is the main dining hall.  The staff is pretty nice too, mostly college kids.    It's your average sushi place, you got various types of maki, then a decent collection of nagiri, but not a lot of variation in sashimi.  I find most of the maki to have too much rice, and it's packed pretty hard, making it a bit too glutenous.  There are o specialty \"wow\" items on the menu, just the basics.  What makes this place decent is the happy hour.  Not every item is in it but it's pretty comprehensive.  Most of the items are a few dollars off and some of them even half price.  Five dollar saki bommers are the real star here.  I'd recommend this place for happy hour but as for the sushi it is sub-par.",

I can see people giving it a star higher for their happy hour deals, etc. but if talking about the quality of the main focus - the food - it's 2 star.   Tuna roll - overwhelming vinegar taste. Not sure if this was the fish or rice. It made me question the freshness.   Spicy scallops looked like cream corn and tasted like mayo + sriracha sauce. The rice and nori were bone dry - so much so that I separated them and only ate the scallop part.   Salmon skin rolls - The grilled skin should have been the star but got muddled with crab meat and other fillings in a very skinny roll.   And these were pretty basic selections - not the fancy rolls with 32 ingredients. That said, they weren't awful - but simply nothing memorable. It's similar to RA or Kona - an inviting space, good happy hour deals, etc. But if you want good fare, check out the higher rated places around town where the food is the star.",

I have eaten here dozens of times and the Sushi has always been good.  I'm partial to the maguro and albacore and their dragon or unagi rolls.  Because nothing says, \"Kiss me baby!\" like some eel in a sweet sweet sauce!.  But hey, it's your own trip. In general the drinks and sushi are fairly reasonably priced.  I've never felt out of place there and the service has always been good.  There's a wall of polaroids of people posing with their heads stuck through a Sumo wrestler cut out which is mildly amusing.

While I have not tried all of their specialty rolls, I especially love their Vegas roll and their Red Dragon roll as well.  The only thing I don't really like is that the service can get really slow for no reason.  I was in there about 2 weeks ago and it took FOREVER to get our last roll.  Our server brought over a Vegas roll (which we hadn't ordered that time) twice and kept forgetting that we hadn't ordered it.  While we weren't in a hurry, it was just a little frustrating to have to wait about 15 minutes for one roll.  Overall, I definitely like this place a lot; I just can't say I would go there if I was in a hurry to get some good sushi then go.  For the happy hour prices and location, definitely worth it if you live down in Tempe and want to get some respectable sushi!",

The other reason is their fairly extensive menu of Vegan options, which is so appreciated.  Our waitress was a doll, very helpful and attentive. Granted we were the 1st ones there, but great service is a standard for this place. Food was great, beautifully served. Love the fresh wasabi! You have to try it. Reasonably priced for the quality. Clean, comfortable.  One of the best sushi spots in the Valley.",

    "text": "Sushi 101! Back on the east coast, this was one of my fave sushi spots to hit. I found this one after a brutal MBA exam recently...I'd had nothing to eat all day (bad idea when you have a three-hour exam) and the Yelp app asked me if I wanted to check in at Sushi 101. Why, oh my goodness, I'd LOVE to check in at Sushi 101!   This was around 4 p.m. on Friday, and the place had a fair number of people in it for that time of day, although it wasn't crowded. Since I was alone the hostess seated me at the bar (which I love in a sushi restaurant). I chose the Monkey Brains and the Krazy Maki rolls. That's A LOT of sushi, m' friends. But I ate all of it (remember, I was dumb enough to take a grad school exam on an empty stomach).   Both of these happened to be deep fried, but they had cream cheese--which is my weakness when it comes to sushi. I would have liked to see more sushi rolls with cream cheese, but my guess is that could be added to any roll.   They have a regular menu which features appetizers, bento specials, soups and salads, other entrees, and noodles. But it's sushi for this chick...   This location is in the group of stores on the NEC of Rural and University Dr in Tempe, just south of the 202. The bar seating is nice. Check the board on the wall for daily specials, and hey--they also offer sushi-making classes!   Bonus: The receipts give you the tip calculations automatically, and they also say \"May the force be with you.\" I'm a fan!",

    "text": "I hate writing negative reviews, but yelpers of the world need to know about this. So...here's the deal...  Going out for drinks with an old friend and we decided we had better eat before getting our drunkenness on. The decision was then made to grab some sushi and although my recommendation was Sakebombers on Broadway and McClintock, she recommend Sushi 101. I've never been, it's close to my place...why not?  I'll give you the good before the bad...   - Cool atmosphere for sure (t.v.'s with the game on, ASU chicks abound, decent layout inside the place),   - Excellent outside sitting area  - Great location   - The flavor and quality of the rolls and food in general is not bad.  HOWEVER, here's \"why not\":  - We got there, asked for a booth and got seated at a middle table...ok, fine.   - Ordered a Bacardi Coke tall...waitress didn't know what I meant. Literally had to explain it to her.  - The calamari appetizer came to the table literally 30 seconds before the first two rolls we ordered were delivered. The other two rolls we ordered didn't make it to the table for another five minutes.  - The presentation of the rolls was HORRIBLE. Both rolls, for each of our orders, were on the same plate, which is obviously fine. BUT they weren't presented in any type of meaningful way...they were just there. All mixed up with some of the pieces on their sides, some upright, some stuck to other pieces just like they were literally thrown onto the plate. I mean, I couldn't tell which roll was which and neither could the waitress so...?? Yeahhh...  - So, we eat some of the food, order some Sake and step out for a smoke. The waitress watched us walk outside. A could minutes later the waitress comes out and says \"Oh, there you guys are. I thought you left. Sorry guys but your table was bussed. I'll take the sake off your bill.\" I mean I get it...mistakes happen. Everybody's human and it was really cool of her to at least openly acknowledged that we should not have to pay for the sake...But what about the rest of my dinner?!?! There was still a very good sized portion of sushi that I ended up paying for which we were not able to eat! My friend had at least half of her order bussed, about a third of mine and almost a whole order of spicy edamame.  - To top it all off, this place was expensive. Even after the sake got taken off, it was still $100+. If I enjoyed the experience then the money wouldn't have been a consideration. But, I paid $100+ for a lackluster dinner that I didn't even get to finish.  Nope, this isn't a place for me. Sakebombers...I'm sorry! Please take me back...",

In outer space.  Just kidding.  Items yelped about as they arrived to the battlefield.  Spicy Garlic Edamame (Profound) Not only is the pungent taste of garlic a wonderful beginning to any fight with hunger, igniting the nose and throat, but the olive oil served as an excellent messenger of the balanced spice mixture.  This plentiful bowl seemed to never end, which my kunoichi ladies would agree provided well needed umami nourishment.  Vegetarian to boot!  Pork Gyoza (Suuuu-weet) Parting is such suuuu-weet sorrow! We made the gyoza become invisible within 3 minutes.  Chicken Katsu (Crunchygood) Katsu in my native tongue is a word of onomatopoeia.  It is used in ancient ritual to help the speaker to acquire a state of enlightenment.  Which I feel we achieved after the first bites.  I had to spar to acquire three of the four end pieces, my personal favorites to dip in the sweet reddish-purple sauce that accompanied.  Rice and vegetables rounded this course up to awesome.    Monsoon Roll (Fresh) It is hard to not get what you want from the proprietors of this noble house.  We waded deeply into our appetizer and entree to be enticed by the sweet offerings of our first sushi roll.  The jalapenos, salmon, avocado, cucumber and yellowtail came and went like the monsoon season of my childhood.  5 ingredients and a sauce to top it equals sweet and simple success.  Chicken Yaki (Transcendent)  Noodles demonstrate synchronicity.  They flow around and with the chicken, ginger, broccoli and cabbage.  The warming sauce was sweet and folded its flavors well into the buckwheat soba noodle.  This plate reminded me of childhood in Osaka and storming castles in Edo.  Good times.  Grizzly Bear Roll (Savage)  Felt like the namesake bear, pawing the last pieces with my O-hashi/chopsticks. I begrudgingly find that it is good form to offer final pieces of a roll that you find most favorable.    Black and Yellow (Aggressive) With it's layered complexities, it was our dark horse.  This SeaBiscuit delivered! Crunch, spice, char, it was all right on target.  Crunch Lollipop (Legend...wait for it......dairy) An excellent ending to an epic culinary journey.  It was more like a sweet treat to put the exclamation mark on.  Served on a skewer with the accompanying sauce, I took my last breaths on the battlefield with this in hand...

It's the type of place where you can bring a newbie sushi eater: plenty of variety so one could easily find something to their taste.   For vegetarians too! Every time I come here I will either have the Crisp Green or Asparagus Tempura (add cream cheese) and I am never disappointed. They also have a unique spin with the edamame: they flavor the pods with this spicy garlic-iness. So good!  We also got the chicken katsu and chicken yaki soba. Huge plates of food! I love the Korean BBQ sauce that comes with the katsu dish and the noodles were quite tasty.   However, their specialty rolls are where its at: unique, hearty, and tasty. I just experienced the Black and Yellow as well as the Grizzly for the first time and they were scrumptious. Both have a shrimp tempura foundation but the BY has spicy krab inside and topped with seared yellowtail on top - it is a wonderful merger of flavors. But the Grizzly subs baked salmon inside and tops with fresh salmon...and this roll is fresh and filling. Interestingly enough, we ended with something almost like a dessert roll, the Lollipop. Each piece comes out on a skewer and the roll is filled with eel and cream cheese then deep fried = yum.  All together, perfect dining experience.",

They gave my food to a table that literally had just been seated with menus in hand and I had already waited 20 minutes for my food to come out since placing my order. Also my waitress didn't check on me during that 20 minute time span. How do you not notice that one of your tables doesn't have anything but water and chopsticks?!   I shouldn't have to get up and ask where my order is. Nor should I have to wait an additional 10 minutes for my food to be made after you realized you gave it to the wrong person. They didn't even know they screwed up until I said something.   Taking care of a $7 sushi bill (it was happy hour) isn't exactly that great of an apology. Never mind the amount of food you wasted and cost you just made for yourself. Not sure how that equals profits for you guys. The manager didn't quite seem to feel too bad about what happened. She seemed rehearsed as if this happens often for her. What I don't understand is how that happened because it wasn't busy at all when I got there. From now on I'll take my business else where.   Tip: Hire competent and attentive staff and managers so stupid mistakes like this don't cost you loyal customers.",

They have good sushi, good miso soup, decent salads, Nice drink selection, and a nice ambiance.    All and all I would say that Sushi 101 is  better than Raw, Blue Wasabi, Kona Grill, or Benni Hana's. That being said, there are a few sushi places in town that are better AKA fresher fish, better ingredients, and superior preparation.  Try: Sushi Creek:  If you don't mind a drive.  Very fresh, very well done.  Mido Sushi:  Authentic little place in Chlander with fast service and great, great, great prices.  Osakas Japanese steakhouse:  in Mesa is my new favorite sushi spot they do everything right!",

I'd give a better rating if they would have used a bit more skill in the preparation. Deep fried roll had a horribly think breading and all the rolls were cut super thick.",

This is pretty much a staple place for all ASU students to go to since it's right across the street from campus.  Anyways, on with the review!  The decor and ambiance of the place is pretty chill.  The place is always busy and service is usually speedy.  Try the stuffed jalapenos; wash it down with lots of eel and salmon; get some different bites of tuna in between; order the obligatory ASU and Sun Devil Rolls; never EVER forget the soft shell crab; and once you've discreetly unbuttoned the top button of your skinny jeans and kicked your feet up into your friend's lap, splurge and get some tempura ice cream because let's face it:  There's always room for fried dessert.  While the quality isn't exactly the best and I wouldn't drive out of my way to stop in for a bite, I'll always have a soft spot for Sushi 101 and all the warm fuzzy [and drunken] memories attached to the place.    Also, they have a great Happy Hour menu worth checking out and their lunch specials are decent.",

It is not that this is a terrible restaurant, it is not, but considering the large number of other sushi restaurants in the area, there is no reason to go back.  Basic problems: 1) Service: It has always been slow and disorganized (i.e. getting seated and not being approached by a server for 15 minutes, always shorthanded) 2) Uninspired food: bland and not especially fresh in taste (their wasabi has little-to-no-kick)  3) Ambience and Smell:  I know that this might seem petty, but there is nothing worse than eating in a place that specializes in preparing fish, and all you can smell is old fish.",

Pretty simple and standard, it's just sushi rice, avocado and nori. Well, I took one bite and thought, yuck. There was something wrong here. I took another bite and wondered if the avocado had gone off, even though it looked quite fresh. I summoned the waitress and told her that there was something quite unappetizing about the roll. She said ok and that she would take it off the bill.  Afer a minute, the manager came out with a piece of avocado on a plate, telling me to try it, saying how fresh it was. \"Nothing wrong! Nothing wrong!\" she said. At first I thought she was trying to reassure me that there was nothing to worry about as far as food-borne illness was concerned. I asked what was in it and she said \"avocado, rice, nori and vinegar.\" Vinegar? Ew. Who the heck puts vinegar in an avocado roll? I guess you don't learn that until Sushi 201?  At the end of the meal, the bill came and the avocado roll was still on it. I brought it to my waitress' attention and she said she talked to the manager and the manager refused to take it off because there was nothing wrong with it. I said, \"So you're going to charge me for food I did not eat?\" And she said, \"Yes, very sorry.\"  And I realized that was why the manager came out, to show me that it didn't matter whether I liked the food or not, since I ordered it, I was going to have to pay for it.  I left no tip and will never return.",

    "text": "Sushi 101 should rename themselves \"Sushi for Meatheads\". This was seriously the worst sushi I've ever had.  So bad, that I refused to eat it.   My sister and I got take-out. The inside of the place seems nice and clean and bright.  There's a bar with drink specials that are named like specialty sushi rolls.   But there are several TVs with various games on, at all times.   My theory is that they do all of this to distract you from the terrible food you are about to receive.    The sushi was poorly rolled.  It wouldn't even stay together.  Also, the meat and fillings inside the sushi were in extremely small portions.  For example, I ordered the special of the day which was an eel crunch roll. It was supposed to be eel, cream cheese, and avocado.  About three end pieces had absolutely no meat in them and the pieces that did were minimal.  The roll itself was 3 inches wide by 5 inches long. If you looked at one piece there was about 1/2 inch of filling and 1 1/4 inches of rice all around.  That is a ridiculously large amount of rice for no discernible reason.   Besides that, I think the only thing that was actually in the entire roll was cream cheese.   Even their soy sauce was substandard.   Even though the food is terrible, the atmosphere seems conducive to large groups and people trying to take in a game in a place other than a sports bar.   I will never go back here (and not just because I live in Philly).",

    "text": "No. No. No. I've had it with this place. I gave it several tries, I even tried to convince myself that it wasn't THAT bad, but it is!  - The sushi is TOO small. Really? It looks like a child's version of sushi. My god, it would take eight rolls to fill me.  For the same price, I'll keep going to the one restaurant at tempe martkeplace. I'll take pretentiousness and overdone japanese furniture over crappy sushi anyday.   Sigh. I wanted to like you, Sushi 101. But you're like that boy I dumped in the 10th grade who talked a lot of talk but ended up being a total bore.",

    "text": "Great-tasting sushi !!! We had vegetable tempura and my cousin asked for the zuchini and sweet potatoes only. It was so good -- crunchy on the outside but hot and juicy on the inside --- that we ordered another batch.   Next was the rainbow roll. It was the best-looking and well-made sushi among the sushi rolls we ordered that night. It looked like it was hard to make with all the ingredients inside and the way it was rolled with the tuna and salmon covering the rice was beautiful. It was delicious. Specially made too :P  Then we had the spicy tuna roll. The first time I set my eyes on it --- made me think that this was done by an amateur or probably a new sushi chef. It was not very appealing with the rice sticking out of the seaweed wrapper and the tuna was all mushy and probably cut with a dull knife (learned from experience making sashimi). I ate it happily with no complaints =). Itadakimasu!!! It was really good. I dipped it in wasabi and soy sauce and it became more spicy!!! It's even good without the wasabi and soy sauce.  The last dish was the golden state roll. It looked like an embutido. Not so beautifully done either (the partitioning of the the stuff inside was not that well defined --- like in the cookbooks or in TV hehe). I asked my cousin what it was, she said it was california maki covered in rice flour then fried. It was also very good. Crunchy on the outside and flavorful on the inside ...If only I weren't so full, I could have eaten it all.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times for lunch, it's great for a nice sit-down meal that's way better and probably much healthier than McDonalds or something. The bento boxes for lunch are an amazing deal, big meal for little prices and the servers are always really friendly (the guy with the Boston accent is my fav). Great place to stop.",

    "text": "I dont know what everyone is complaining about here, There sushi is fresh and is excellent for the price during happy hour. I can order about 6 rolls for under 25 dollars. This is not by any means a world class sushi restaurant, but it is a great local restaurant serving the Tempe area. And people were complaining about service? Every time I have eaten here, my server has been great.  Sushi 101 has consistent sushi, and I leave happy with a belly full of fish every time!",
