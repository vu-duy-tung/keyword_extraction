My son had a Coke float, daughter had a scopp of ice cream and I had a hot fudge sundae. Holly hell, that hot fudge sundae was as big as my head! And I loved EVERY bit of it. You walk through an antique room to get to the restaurant and then there is a vintage/antique store  connected on the other side, too. After the ice cream, we wandered around and looked at all of the cool stuff for it. Unfortunately, my four year old is like an elephant in a china store, so I couldn't exactly relax.   The next day, I came back and picked up some reasonably priced vintage/thrift store dresses around $20 a piece. The black dress was perfect for a 20's party I attended and the second dress was a long sleeved, low cut, long red dress with yellow flowers that I am wearing today for a Halloween party.   Ice cream and antiques are the way to spend the day!",

Very awesome soda bar, with about every flavor of soda known to man. I quickly ordered a strawberry-banana soda and looked at the menu. For the most part it's a very simple menu, they obviously don't have fryers so the sides are kind of lame {bagged potato chips, really?} but I was not disappointed in the hamburger I got! Mmmmmmm! So delicious! Real cheese, a nice meaty taste and the bun seriously melted in my mouth - dare I say freshly baked?   Now for the dessert! We got the turtle sundae and it was amazing!! The portion size will not disappoint, and the ice cream had the perfect texture and consistency.   Really loved my first visit to MacAlpine's and I will definitely be going back for round two and three and four and...",

I love ice cream immensely, but I swear our waitress loved ice cream as much as I do. And that's certainly a plus! It's always great to know your server can honestly recommend you great items on the menu because they love it as much as you do.  As for what we ordered: The King Kong, Beerbutter, and Lucky Leprechaun. The King Kong? Really good. Beerbutter? Also really good. Mixed together? MAGIC. Stick two straws in your mouth and have at it! The Lucky Leprechaun was also wonderful - but admittedly, I was never a fan of mint ice creams... despite that, I still drank this lovely float and enjoyed it wonderfully~ I can't say for sure how it tasted when mixed with BOTH the King Kong and Beer Butter, mostly because by then my stomach, tongue, and throat had been sweetened to the point of no return. I also ordered a Yin & Yang on the side as my main meal (Did I mention that I *love* ice cream?), which was absolutely delicious. And my partner ordered a sloppy joe, which was surprisingly sweet! That was also delicious.  I will say, as someone who's eaten tons of ice cream from various restaurants, bars, stores, and hole-in-the-walls: Their ice cream quality isn't perfectly amazing. Their toppings and syrups aren't top-notch. As I'm not a soda-expert, I can't account for the quality of the sodas. What makes this place earn five stars, however, is the overall, combined experience.  The flavor choices, with their fun names and creative combinations... The customizations you can add that seem infinite... The warm, homey environment... The interesting bits and bobs to stare at... And the smiling service...? All added up to an unforgettable experience.  I wish I lived in the area so I could come here again and again. Those of you lucky enough to be in the area: Go in and try it out!",

Its only real competitor might be 5 & Diner, but the beauty of MacAlpine's is that it is a genuine, original soda fountain, operating for over 70 years. This place is the real deal, and we're so happy it is still here in Phoenix after all these years.  You can't beat the selection and quality of ice cream sodas, malts, floats, sundaes - even the unusual egg creams and phosphates! You've gotta try one once, just for the experience. The food is quite good - our favorite menu item is the hot pastrami on rye, which comes with a pickle and a side of potato chips or some very good coleslaw. This pastrami is one of my favorite versions of the sandwich in town, I prefer it even over Miracle Mile Deli and Chompie's, which are both excellent.  The adjoining antique shops are small but cool and always have interesting new goodies and vintage clothing.",

The counter, flooring, and tables/booths looked to have been around for decades and I really appreciate how it was not torn out and updated, something rare to find these days in the Valley.  Milkshake was pretty good. It was just under $4.  Soup was homemade and not too bad. $1.95 for a cup. I didn't try their other food. Chips come with burgers, no fries.  Service gets 2 stars - UGH! They do their best to avoid eye contact and never clear away the dirty dishes. I don't think the Food Servers have assigned tables, so they really aren't very attentive. I almost felt like getting up and making my own milkshake, because no one was around.  I worked as a Food Server in my college days and if I were them, I'd be taking every customer that came in the door, get customers in and out quickly = more tips. These young gals just didn't seem to care. Sad.  The antique shop attached to the restaurant was on the pricey side, but looked like a mini department store of the past with a nice selection of vintage clothing. Fun to look, esp being in the old building made it more authentic.",

The bun was stale and smashed and the potato salad had no flavor, I think it was store bought. Pickles were good.  I asked for fries, only to be told that they don't have any.  Plus, the owners were off in a corner taking photos to post on Ebay or whatever and a huge flash would go off and everyone in the place seemed annoyed, but they didn't care.  Place was dirty...very dirty, dingy and well, I spent $40-some dollars on garbage. We left and I took the kids to Coco's down the street because we were all still hungry.  We left all of our food.   If you want ice cream, go.  Pass on the food.",

Great egg salad sandwiches, blt's, cheeseburgers that are\" real\" - interesting soups and specials. Potato salad is yumolicious. Shakes and sodas done anyway you like, couldn't be better.  Also an antique emporium and a bit of a historical site, in a minor way - I'll let you find out why. Highly recommend. Wonderful service, very modest prices.",

I was hesitant based on the reviews here about cleanliness and mediocre food, but the place is a local legend and we had to give it a try.  On the way to our booth, we passed a large empty table that still had the messy remains of previous diners and wondered why the not-busy-at-all waitstaff hadn't cleaned it up yet. The food was on the high side of \"just OK.\"  The malt, ice-cream soda, and phosphates we ordered with dinner were fantastic.  But, before the final curtain of the show, the cramping began for what would be a 24-hour bout of food poisoning traced back - by process of elimination - to McAlpines chicken salad.  I suppose if you want a delicious soda fountain treat, this is your place.  If you want to eat diner food without getting sick, go somewhere else.",

I didnt even know they had a vintage clothing store in back!  I went in thinking I would just turn around and leave. However, I was lead to a back room where they had a few wedding dresses on a rack. I started looking through them and came across the most beautiful ivory, lace bodice with a tule ballroom gown dotted with lace daisies and a detachable LONG daisy adorned tule train.  With a few updates and some modification this dress is the most beautiful dress I have ever seen. I said YES tho the dress at MacAlpines!!!!!  Who would of ever thought I would find my dress here? The girls at the soda fountain were so helpful and super fun! They then proceeded to make me a wedding cake soda! SO GOOD!!! It was the best and most fun unexpected wedding dress buying experience I could've ever hoped for. This is a memory that will last forever....thank you girls!!! You are the best!!! I will send you a wedding picture for sure!",

I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \"Best lunch in town!\" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself \"Yes, i think I will\". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly. But I want to go again, with company, not by myself and I'll rate it again.",

The place started out as a pharmacy/ market and now it is a diner/ antique shop. The menu is pretty short, sandwiches and a few blue plate specials.  I ended up getting the malibu chicken sandwich. It was good but a little dry. My wife got the meatloaf, that was good. My son got a fluffer nutter (peanut butter and marsh-mellow cream).  Let's face it, what you really come here for is the dessert. The ice cream sodas are pretty cool. Overall the price is a little bit higher than what I would expect but you have to pay a bit sometimes for ambience.  Service was good. The waitresses were fast and efficient.",

    "text": "Finding MacAlpine's is fairly simple as it's located on the corner of 7th and E. Oak. There's a small parking lot on the side of the building off of Oak st. When you first walk in you might think to yourself, \"Whoa, this place serves food?\" And yes, my friend they certainly do. Once you get passed the trinkets and other items you'll find an original old fashioned soda bar, several booths, and dining tables. The decor is a cluttered arrangement of vintage 1920's and 30's memorabilia.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with answering my questions about the many creative ice cream soda creations available. They use hand scooped ice cream and flavored sodas created the same way it was in the late 1920's. I have to admit it made for one of the, if not the best, ice cream sodas I've ever had. Yes, it was really that good.   For my menu choice I opted for the chef's special that day which happened to be a meatloaf sandwich. Served on toasted wheat bread, with fresh tomato, lettuce and a slight bit of mayo. The meatloaf itself was packed full of flavor. Although a little softer in texture than I usually prefer, I couldn't stop eating until my plate was clean. Even though I ordered a side of coleslaw and got potato salad instead. I was truly not disappointed. The potato salad was to die for. I wish I could order more and have it shipped home.   If you've made it this far in my review, give yourself a treat and head to MacAlpines. There's a 10 lb sundae called 'The Legend' waiting for your challenge.",

The potato salad is awesome. I always order an extra side of it.   Their deserts are killer. Chocolate fudge for miles. My husband had a root-beer float which he swears is the best he's ever had.

Haven't tried the food yet, but they have a very long list of desserts, ice cream flavors, ice cream sodas, etc.  I got a soda, my wife got ice cream - both were really good.  Really fun decor - there's an antique shop as well.  Can't wait to go back!",

When you walk in, forget the present and take some time to look at the hundreds of artifacts from \"yesteryear\".  I must give credit to Arizona Highways.  They ran a piece many years ago about MacAlpines.  We took a ride from Sun City all the way down to the 7th St & McDowell area and gave it a try, and have been back many, many times.    They offer many flavors of ice cream, including coffee which is more popular on the east coast.  Normally, we'll split a meal so we can make room for the sundaes that we know we shouldn't order, but we do - every time!  Friday afternoon we stopped for sundaes only.  Lindsey was our server and did an excellent job.",

So I've passed this place many times on the way home from work and I've always wanted to go in. I did not realize it was a little soda shop attached to an antique store. The waitress told me to sit wherever. There was the typical soda fountain style counter and then also a medium-sized area with dining tables including booths.   The menu consist of a bunch of sandwiches and some other simple things. I asked my waitress what is the most popular and she said the Reuben. So thats what i got! It came out promptly with potato salad and a pickle on the side. It was SO good.  I finished up my meal and instead of the waitress giving me a check she said \"so apparently an old friend from high school already paid for your meal so you can go whenever you want.\" It was so bizarre. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before! Especially not in Phoenix because I went to school in Long Island, NY.  Anyway, what a strange afternoon. Luck? Pay it forward? Someone just being generous? Someone mistaken me for someone else? I guess I will never know.",

I drove past it, as I've done a million times before, then came back when I realized my original lunch destination is closed on Mondays. As I was driving to my second lunch destination, I drove past this place again and decided to stop in. And I am so glad I did. I love the ambience. I had to do a double look around when I first walked in.... \"What year am I in?\" I ordered some water while I read through the menu. She brought me a cup without a straw... At first I was upset but then I noticed the old school straw container on the table. I giggled. I really giggled. Within minutes, my spirits were lifted.   Then I saw the menu. Ice cream. Soda fountain drinks. Soda with ice cream. My inner child was jumping with joy. I got squirmy. I couldn't decide what I wanted. I want it all! I want it all NOW mommy! Oh wait, mom's in CA... And I'm 37 years old... But I still want it all!   I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and old fashioned strawberry shake. The burger was pretty good. But I sat on the bench, swaying side to side, dancing in my seat to the oldies playing on the speakers, while sipping on my strawberry milkshake. I'm in love with this place. And it has such a rich history. I'm going to tell everyone I know about this place. I can't wait to bring my 7 year old Godson here.",

The food was terrible and completely overpriced. If you want a burger, you will find a better one at McDonald's for $6 less. The service was not good. I sat at the old fashioned bar, where they were scooping ice cream, but was never checked on. Instead the employees were gossiping about a coworker. The icecream was something you could buy at the grocery store. Do not waste your time here. Go to Mary Coyle's instead.",

I got the hot chef special for the night, meatloaf sandwich.  It was pretty good.  The staff was friendly, but not very attentive.

It mentioned some of the special features of the place, the antique store attached to a soda fountain, the ravishingly rich and delightful food servings, and so on.  But what I want to comment upon is the fact that the 1928 counter and the bar stools and all the counter and wall trappings and paraphernalia throughout is more than a representation of the way it was -- this place IS the WAY it was, and is therefore a step above just being authentic. I know.  I grew up with soda fountains like MacAlpine's as a necessary part of every drug and department store everywhere.  The MacAlpine food, however, is several steps above and more opulent than those old soda bars of the 30s and 40s.  I don't want to tell you much more -- this place is just like the Organ Stop Pizza in Mesa AZ -- they both qualify as competitors for the 8th wonder of the world award, and, well, you just have to go and find out for yourself.  You will keep going back, just like I have all 15 years I have been in Arizona !!  Wes Flinn",

    "text": "I'm sad to say that I wasn't in love with MacAlpine's.  The fact that the building has never been restored is cool, in a dirty kind of way.  The floors will never be clean enough, because they are so old.  That may seem ridiculous, but cleanliness is important to me when I'm eating somewhere.  Our server was odd, but helpful and attentive.  We spent a good amount of time oogling the random items displayed throughout and were entertained with our surroundings.  The food is where I saw the problem- my Mac Cheeseburger was bland and tasteless.  My broccoli and cheese soup was below average.  I wasn't impressed one bit.  We ended up having dessert.  I opted for a single scoop of Chocolate Malt Krunch, which I'd never had before and didn't love (total personal preference as my friend loved it).  MacAlpine's is cool, but I think purely as a place to get something sweet.",

    "text": "This place has it all.  Start with atmosphere as there is absolutely no way to ignore it.  In a mad jumble of antiquities ranging from the 20's to the 70's every item is either a conversation piece, memory or a must have.  I bought a mod 60's chappeau my baby brother picked out as being \"me\" and I am eyeing a full bonnet hair dryer the size of a rice cooker :p  Onto the soda fountain.  There are egg creams, hot fudge and a toe curling number of flavor possibilities. I always want to cook up something outrageous to try but seem to drift toward their amazing executions of classic favorites.  The regular menu is exactly as it should be.  I have yet to be bold enough to try their Hawiian cole slaw (so 50's) but all of their soups, sides, etc. taste home made with reasonable prices.  I was reading through the reviews here and saw a couple mentions of split pea soup ... how is it I've never been when they've had it?!?!  I am now on a mission to go when it is being served.  On a side note, MacAlpine's serves stuffed tomotoes!  Your choice of tune or chicken salad, I imagine they'd do egg if you asked over greens and surrounded by lots of veggies, etc.  It's the kind of dish to inhale after killing yourself at the gym and you won't feel all that bad about it.  P.S. Sometimes the service can seem a bit oddly timed but when you take into account the division of labor and the nature of the place it does make sense.  Also, I once brought a friend in here who needed to sober up a bit and our server didn't turn a hair despite some truly outlandish observations on my friend's part.",

I ordered the Cole Slaw since I don't hate it *as much* as potato salad.  Well, hmm...it was OK.  I had the cherry lime egg creme. It was OK too...I'm used to it with ice in it though.  The Chocolate malt was...lacking malt.  The good side of all this was the antiques!  Wow, what a great cute place for antiques! A little over priced but fund just the same.  I'll go back but only to look at the antiques and maybe try some different sodas.",

The worst part  gets worse after the male took our order  and constantly making us repeat yourself more then twice because he seem to keep for getting. I went with getting a Ruben sandwich  when I go to put mustered on my samwitch found a small roach in it  the owner offered me a discount on my next meal instead of refunding my money why the hell would I ever go back if I found a insect in my damn food beyond disgusted. Cool throw back set up  but disgusting where the food is made and the owners feel sorry for the people that work there wouldn't be surprised if the health department shut them down.",

Before we even sat down to eat and enjoy the famous shakes, we adventured through the store where we found antique pieces from a plethora of eras. Each room held treasures from several decades. It was so much fun hearing my dad tell stories of how some of these items were what he grew up with. The manager Monica was a pure delight and made sure we enjoyed every second of our journey through this amazing and fascinating place!

The wait staff were dressed in mismatched outfits, grungy socks and shoes. The shelves in the restaurant itself are packed full of ageless classic memorabilia. It was fun to sit and let your eyes wonder over everything ~ almost overwhelming. We're talking \"out of control packed\"!  Walking in we really did not know if we were in the right place because you don't walk directly into the restaurant. There are technically three rooms that cross in the center room which is the restaurant. Each of the side rooms are small and hold antiques, clothing, furniture pictures and misc. items.   Our waitress was friendly and service was OK. I had an old fashion soda with lime syrup, vanilla ice cream and a shot of phosphate. It was refreshing. The hubster had a tuna melt and a root beer shake. There is plenty on the menu to please any palate.",

It was piece of bread with cold cuts that after one bite I (and I didn't swallow it) didn't taste fresh. The potato's were cold and chunky and the gravy was from a can. The salad was wilted but the carrots in the salad were good but the ranch dressing was runny and watered down. In my personal opinion my dinner sucked. My son's burger looked wrong and as it was a cooked perhaps it was microwaved or maybe cooked and then put away and then just heated up. He's 9 and said dad this is the worst and my son has eaten at a ton of places and been very brave at times. My wife and daughter didn't want to be linked to this review so they said it was nothing special at all. We had ice cream too but its nearly impossible to mess that up so they don't get stars for scooping it out of a bucket.   I understand the charms of this place, this next to new store that also serves food. My daughter purchased a cool little coat and read a newspaper about John F Kennedy being shot and no, they do not get a point to teaching a bit about history. God I had high hopes for this place I read the views and even the bullet holes in the glass in the front windows (they really do look like bullet holes) didn't keep me from there. I've eaten at places all over and the neighborhood does not make a restaurant bad. Its the owners or the cooks or wait staff that can bring a place down. The wait staff were super polite and dressed cute in 1950s uniforms so that was an effort. For 4 people it was about $80.00 which my wife said when we got into the car she felt really cheated and let down. She was 100% disappointed because I told her to pick a place we had never been to. She even said sorry on the way to the event tonight. I said it was not your cooking and you did your research.   Maybe the cook had just quit and they had a new one but when I was a cook the servers would yell at me if the dish needed to be cleaned up or you expect me to serve this and get a tip? Remake it and make it look like the pictures so I can get a good tip and I don't kill you after we close the kitchen. That is what makes a restaurant work where everyone cares about it from the cooks, waitstaff to the busboys everyone works together like a machine to make sure the place will continue. I just don't know if this one will.   Good Luck out there.",

    "text": "I recently moved to Phoenix & spotted MacAlpine's by accident on Yelp. I checked out the photos, then the reviews and then the menu and knew I had to visit. After having dinner nearby  I stopped by just a bit before they closed on a weekday and it wasn't very busy. I know that this place must be hopping on the weekends though. What a gem! So many options: salads, sandwiches, ice cream sodas, floats, shakes, sundaes and all types of ice cream galore. We were greeted right away and placed our order for \"The grasshopper\" Mint chocolate chip icecream with hot fudge, crushed oreos and whipped cream as well as \"Mud pie\" Coffee icecream with hot fudge and oreos. Both were fantastic and delicious. What a cool vibe this little restaurant has, it felt as if you were back in a time warp. We loved it and will be back! Not just for the icecream but also for the shop and all it's unique vintage stuff. Very cool. So glad I found MacAlpine's.",

    "text": "The second star is because I had an absolutely wonderful experience the first time I came here! It was earlier this year and there was only one employee working at that time, but he was so friendly and welcoming! He gave great suggestions for drinks and it was just overall great service and amazing experience. The decorations are also just so cute, I love the juke boxes on the tables!  My first time at Macalpine's was so great that I came back again today! It was like an entirely different place. We walked in an hour before close and were greeted by dirty looks from the two girls working. I totally understand being somewhat annoyed with people coming in when you're getting ready to close - I've worked several jobs in the food industry - but at every one of those places, we'd put on a smile and treat them the same whether it was an hour before closing or a minute before closing.  I just asked for the drink menu, not realizing the ice cream section was on the food menu. I didn't want to bother the girl again so I went to pick up what I thought was the food/ice cream menu from the counter myself. The girl just came to our table and took them away, only saying, \"That's the kids' menu\" pretty rudely.  The cherry on top was that it somehow ended up being over $9 for a hot fudge sundae. It was listed as 6.59 in the menu, and even with 10% tax and 15% tip that shouldn't have been much over $8 unless toppings were extra, but all I had on it was the caramel, fudge, and whipped cream, all of which were listed under what came on it. And it's not like I really care about an extra dollar or two, but it was definitely not worth nearly $10 for 2 scoops of subpar ice cream and terrible service.   This is actually the worst review I've ever left for any place, but I was just so disappointed after having had such a great time the first time I tried it. This place might be worth the high prices if you really like the nostalgic atmosphere, but I personally don't think I'll be returning.",

I've been coming here on and off for a few years, and it basically is the same experience each time. The food is just okay, the service is just okay.....the pricing is average and so are the desserts (at least from what ive had). It truly is the history of the place, and its darling decorations that keep me coming back. Unfortunately, that has nothing to do with my appetite, and since I cant just go in there to hang out and escape 2016, I have to order something.   You could spend hours looking at all of the items they have, in the front shop and the vintage clothing part....its just so neat to take a step back, and forget that your right off 7th st in the middle of rush hour. Do I think its worth experiencing? Yes. Do I crave their food? No. Honestly, I only come here when they do a groupon. Because unfortunately there are many many places nearby that have way better food, and service. They just cant offer the inside this place does. Its worth stopping in, but not sure its a place I could ever be a regular out, unless the up'd the menu.",

The old fashion soda shop is what gave you two stars. And the kind waitress with a electric personality.  Bad news is their food menu. I was hoping for at least fresh meat frozen would have been okay. The all beef aka ground hamburger is a few days old. The patties are prolly pre made and microwaved. My son literally burnt his mouth. They microwave pre cooked old meat and melt cheese on it. Bad business. I refused to eat mine let my boyfriend stomach my food. Smh. The owner needs to stop collecting junk and hire a better cook.  Do not eat their meat. Id love to see how they stored it. Kinda disgusted.  But lesson learned.",

This little gem is a must visit for anyone in the area. The one issue I had was the food lacked a bit of salt, but this wasn't a big enough issue for me to drop the stars.   Cheers.",

My wife got one of their ice cream sodas the pineapple-upside down cake and this was super super sweet until all the ice cream started melting and then it got pretty good. Overall, I would come back just because the vibe is cool but there are definitely much better places in the valley for ice cream and desserts.",

We browsed the racks of vintage clothing and costume jewelry before sitting down at the bar. It was difficult to choose our milkshake flavor, given the dizzying array of syrups and ice cream combos, but after settling on chocolate and wild cherry, we were very pleased. Plus it was a cheerful looking thing, topped with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, and a cherry. I was not as pleased with the service... it wasn't busy until after we sat down, but no one took our order or even gave us a menu or a \"hello\" until we'd been sitting for about 10 minutes. A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait. While we waited, I did enjoy looking at all the cool decor from the past, though I think the whole place could be a little bit cleaner.",

The food gets two stars...stay away from the turkey burger the meats gray and has no taste.  The daily special is your best bet if you are really hungry and cant wait to go someplace better.  The decor is nice and authentic for its time but I don't understand why it has an antique shop attached to it.  There isn't even a door separating the restaurant from a huge amount of vintage clothing.  Vintage cloths and kids with sticky fingers don't mix.  Of course my son wanted to look at all the vintage stuff and when he tried on an old hat (with my permission) an older woman(maybe the owner) yelled at him and told him \" the vintage cloths are not for dress up\".  I was going to buy the hat for him because I could tell that  he really liked it but if he cant even try it on I don't see the point.  We left the so called Ice Cream shop/Goodwill disappointed and a little angry that we had spent so much over $100 on food and ice cream for the family.  Even though this is an ice cream shop I wouldn't take your kids.",

Having read all the reviews of the food, we ate before we arrived, desiring only ice cream.  Boy, they have a selection.  I mean items I haven't seen in 40 years.  My wife and I each ordered 2-scoop sundaes, figuring that one scoop would not be enough.  When a concoction as tall as my arm is long ended up on the table, I immediately remembered how it was \"back in the day\" when people actually gave you a hefty helping, rather than skimped/chinced on portion size.  The Rocky Road was the best I've ever had.  This sundae was the \"real deal,\" packed with toppings, whipped cream, sauce, etc.  Here, they make them like they \"used to\" and boy was that a pleasant surprise.  Truly a great and delicious experience.  I'll be back for more ice cream items.  Can't believe how much treat you get for your $ !!!",

The cookie dough shake I had was delicious. It's not hard to forget you're in the 21st century the moment you walk in, since the only thing you'll find inside that's less than several decades old are the waitresses.",

Look no further than Mac Alpine's Soda Fountain on 7th Street and Oak. Located in downtown Phoenix, this original soda fountain established in 1928 is the last one of its kind and an original of the Southwest. Equipped with a diverse menue of inexpensive but delicious soups and sandwiches, Mac Alpines is the place to go for a good old fashioned malt, shake, soda, or sundae. Good quality service, and historic memorabilia make this dining experience all the more wonderful. Also, don't forget your pocket change! Mac Alpines is also home to an amazing jukebox that plays old 45s! The perfect place to listen to some real oldies, with a date, or a group of friends!",

We dressed the part and that was a lot of fun. My guests were very pleased and made them feel like teenagers all over again!  the hamburgers were wonderful and the ice cream soda, well what can I say ! Awesome ! everyone was in Awwa trying to figure what flavor they wanted. So many to choose.It is a small place only sits about 55 but it does fit the theme.     They do have antique areas hugging the shop,one on each side of it.one side clothing the other furniture. Yes it does have an old smell to it ,hence antique.But once you sit at the booth and get a wiff of the hamburgers it all goes away.Waitresses were happy to pose for pictures in fact they are in the calender they sell that reflicts the era.Can't say enough you just have to stop by and give it a try.",

But I went in to browse their men's dress outfits because we are looking for a vest for my husband to be. Well, we found it! I can't believe we found it so easily. The lady was so nice and told us she would hold it for 24 hours so we can look some other places before making the final decision. The way the place is set up is so awesome. I loved how the little diner was in the middle. We were going to go there but just felt like something different for dinner. The whole feel of this place is completely unique and fun. The store is all spread out so you never have someone breathing down your neck asking what you want. I will definitely be back to this place. Probaby today :)",

It's crammed with old pharmacy stuff and signs, just lots to look at. I really wanted to love this place but I can't because the service just isn't what it should be. We were helped by two of the staff during our visit, one very friendly waitress who breezed by and said hello  and a waiter who couldn't have appeared more miserable.   I was surprised at how small and, hate to say it, dull, the menu is. Burgers, hot dogs and cold sandwiches. The burgers are from frozen patties and I actually had to pull a big chunk of cartilage out of my mouth. Yuck. They use Thrifty brand ice cream and have an extensive menu of ice cream sodas made with unusual flavors. We ordered our sundaes and for some reason, they were made one at a time, so that my companion was halfway through with his before mine was delivered, and it was completely wrong. Wrong ice cream, wrong topping. But it took so long to get that I just ate it. I'm not going to complain too bitterly over ice cream. And I hope this place works out its kinks and does well.",

Very cute inside. The service was very poor. Our waitress was sitting up at the soda bar eating when we walked in, then sat us down, handed us menus, didn't greet us and told us to just ask if we have questions to ask the table behind us since they apparently had a lot that she had answered before we arrived. Most awkward intro ever. We did have a lot, since it was our first time there and we didn't know how the menu worked. We ended up ordering a butterscotch-cookie dough ice cream soda and a fudge sundae with pistachio and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and nuts. OMG it was soooo yummy!! Biggest sundae I had ever been served! And you can bet I ate that entire thing!  When we got our bill we couldn't believe how cheap it was for all that amazingness! We can forgive the customer service because that's not the main reason we went there in the first place.",

I even commented that I felt like I was back in the 50's and should be sitting in the back of the restaraunt. Ahem. I have a pretty sick sense of humor, but one of the waiters did laugh loudly at my sentiment. They have a list of over 50 types of sodas/egg creams, milkshakes. I was in love. I ordered a nectar egg cream and it was to . die. for. Did I mention you get free refills? Holy crap!! They served me the best Pastrami sandwhich I have ever tasted in my life.  and that's just the food. We haven't even mentioned the shopping. Loads and loads of authentic 50's furniture and clothing and other souvenirs for sale. Box purses. All at more than reasonable prices. Some at downright cheap prices.  I mean I was in love, love , love. I told my grandmother, who lives in Michigan, that when she visits me, MacAlpines is the first place I'm taking her in Phoenix.",

I've gone back twice in one week since my first time because they have so much delicious ice cream and options to try. The first time I ever went I had an Italian Soda with Mango syrup, but they let me know that you can have as many different flavors as you want because refills are free on them. Then, I had a hot fudge sundae and it was adorable and delicious. The decorations are what really make this place amazing, but the desserts don't disappoint and the employees are so sweet and when they ran out of bananas for the banana split I originally ordered they were so nice and funny about it, I didn't even care. I guess the lunch menu could be a little better, but I really think you can get food anywhere, the experience at Macalpine's is what makes it so unique.",

I added a pic of the mustard bottle, soooo disgusting and they were all like  that! Cool cuz it is a real old soda counter, but it could be sooooo much better! I  wish it was a cool blast from the past with a soda Jerk in a sharp uniform, but instead there  is a guy in pants and shirt too big for him! Great idea, but cleanliness is not a thing here at all!

(for the dessert, not the food; didn't try the food based on reviews) I'll be honest --we came because we saw they had a Butterbeer icecream float and we are huge Harry Potter nerds. But we ended up liking other stuff on the menu too. Where else can you get a huge icecream float with whipped cream and a cherry on top for $3.75? My friends and I each ordered a different float from their specialty menu (we were not adventurous enough to make up our own combo) and we each loved what we ordered. I would've drank all of mine if it hadn't been so huge.   I also love the strange kitschy inside that's kind of dusty and vintage and odd. The sad part was the jukebox at our table was broken. Next time I'll play a song for sure!  Only gripe is that it closes at 8. Don't they know most people want dessert between the hours of 8-10 pm??",

We ordered a sloppy joe (yum) and a club sandwich to share. As clubs go this was delicious. The bacon cooked to perfection. Good fresh meats and cheeses. Prob best club Sammy ever.   Third, ice cream soda fountain!!! I ordered the Bettie Page (cheesecake soda w/strawberry ice cream). Beautiful!!! They have about 20 flavors to try. Also thrifty ice cream (a whole bunch of flavors). All in all you should definitely try this place.",

Currently I am hooked on their floats and ice cream sodas.  So many soda flavors to choose from and a list of favorite flavor combos, it can be the nightmare of someone as indecisive as myself.  To date I really have only had their \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" ice cream soda which is butterscotch soda with pecan praline ice cream.  Honestly the quality pecan praline ice cream makes this drink, with generous ribbons of caramel and toasted candied pecans mixed into creamy vanilla ice cream (thank you Thrifty!). Mix all that goodness with the butterscotch soda and YUMMM!!  I went back to try it with butterbeer flavor and didn't find it much different but still as tasty.    Having asked a few servers what their favorites were  I now look forward to trying the \"James Dean \" and a \"Chocolate Egg Cream\"....",

Vegetables were fresh and of a sufficient quantity.   However,  the hard boiled egg was food service.  No bacon, which almost always comes in a chef's salad.  Meats were the cheapest of the cheap.  Couldn't really pick out what the flavor was, with the exception of sodium.   Went here with an Entertainment BOGO.  The small print on the coupon stated after 5 PM.  I missed the fine print,  but the server didn't.  Interesting to note that they close at 7 PM.  This is a very short window.   IF we had gotten the BOGO,  the rating probably would have been a 3.

The owner is really really nice and I love to hear her stories about the ghosts sightings. The kids really love the bears on the beach ice cream and always have a good time here.  It's really cool to see the old merchandise that's for sale like signs, old cars, luggage, cigarette machines, old stoves or jewelry. I love that the old pharmacy is where the cook is. It kind of smells old but it's so unique. I think everybody needs to check this place out at least once. Today we went with 10 people six of them being kids from 8 to 13 years old and they loved it.",

The food tastes like something your Grandmother would have made for you.  We have a lot of friends come from out of town, so before they start asking about cowboys and cactus, a little stop here is a fun place to start their trip.  Everything is good, but don't expect fancy, this is not that kind of place.    Think beverage and order a classic like an egg cream.  It is a beverage consisting of milk, carbonated water, and chocolate syrup. The drink contains neither eggs nor cream. Grandfather loved this one. Our youngest or our group alway has a chocolate malted shake.  The number of soda's you can order will blow your mind and the prices are more than reasonable.",

My some had a sarsaparilla French cream soda, and i chose the Italian sarsaparilla. Both were delicious.  There is a nice old fashion lunch counter, and cozy booths. There are also some tables you can sit at if you have a larger party.  If you are looking for some antiques, or nostalgic collectibles, they have these too.  was a great experience, and my 17 y/o son said he wants to go back.",

Then wander around and buy a red leather jacket possibly worn by Michael Jackson in his Thriller video. Or get a sequined vest...everyone needs one. Walking down the street may get risky but this pace is not. And the staff and owner are there and they ROCK.",

I opted for their peach tea but next time think I'm going to splurge on a cherry soda! Open the menu to a complete surprise! They are vegetarian friendly and have quite the veg selection! It was my friends birthday and they gave him a huge hot fudge sunday with a candle in it on the house. Nice touch! Will be back to try the sodas and more of the menu!

On my first trip I was disappointed to learn that they don't serve French fries (no fryer), but I've been back countless times since and I'm over it. The floats (\"ice cream sodas\") are fabulous, and the menu is overwhelming. So many options - all the more reason to come back. My husband is not the biggest fan of ice cream but he humors me, and on our last trip he ordered a slice of pecan pie which ended up being the best pecan pie we have had in Phoenix (bested only by a pie we tried on a trip to New Orleans).   As much as I love the floats, the real reason we come is the atmosphere. It feels like you have stepped back in time, or like you have entered The Twilight Zone! especially if you go when the place is empty. Some of the servers really go the extra mile to complete the illusion, fixing their hair in what must be a time-consuming 40's pin-up style. The vibe is so authentic and sort of... creepy (in a good way) it is easy to imagine that it's haunted.   The antiques and vintage art and Knick-knacks certainly add to the vibe, and are quite inexpensive compared to similar stores.",

    "text": "1929.  That's when one of Phoenix's last remaining soda fountains opened its doors in the same spot that MacAlpine's sits today.  Originally a pharmacy/soda fountain called Birch's, Fred MacAlpine bought the operation in 1938 and made it his own.  Fast forward almost 80 years later, its still here.  While the restaurant is the obvious draw here, MacAlpines is more antique store than anything else.  In fact about three quarters of the MacAlpine's space is dedicated to antique furniture, antique decor, and even an old school clothing boutique.  And they quite literally stack all of their merchandise from floor to ceiling throughout the building.  It's probably a fire marshall's worst nightmare, but I came here on a Friday at lunchtime for the food nostalgia more than anything else.  The restaurant space is squeezed in between the antique sections of the building with sock hop music in the background, neon clocks and signage and (you guessed it) more antiques hanging on the walls and the shelves for your viewing pleasure.  Come on in and seat yourself at the counter or one of a number of booths inside.  There's seating for probably 50-60 inside altogether.  Once seated I was given a menu by the woman who spent almost the entire time whipping up malts and sundaes for the clientele.  The dessert menu here at MacAlpine's (as other have pointed out) is quite expansive.  I was however surprised to see such an expansive non-dessert menu as well.  So choosing your food can take awhile.  I was feeling in a particularly old school mode so I went for a dish that likely wouldn't be on most people's lunch plans, but I channelled my inner Will Ferrell from Wedding Crashers and exclaimed \"Mom! Meatloaf!\".  Okay I didn't really say that to the waitress, but I did decide on trying their Meatloaf Dinner.  I've had good meatloaf and bad, but when its good, oh man is it ever.  MacAlpine's version comes with mashed potatoes and gravy along with a side of tarragon carrots and a starter side salad.  When it came out, it certainly looked like I'd hoped.  The taste?  Not so much.  The meat was pretty tender and juicy so I can't complain on that front, but I would've liked the vegetables (particularly the celery and onion) to be cooked down more.  I like the meat to standout on dishes like this, but the crunch and somewhat briny taste of the veggies took away from the dish in my opinion.  The carrots and potatoes were fine, but the gravy was a little runny for my liking.  All in all, not that impressed.  Now for dessert, the choices are almost overwhelming.  Malts, sundaes, ice cream sodas, floats, shakes...what's a guy to do?  Well, I did say I was feeling nostalgic, didn't I?  So you can imagine what happened when my eyes fixed on a sundae called the Wallace & Ladmo.  For anyone born before the mid 80s, there were few things Phoenix area kids wanted more than to get their hands on a Ladmo bag on the Wallace & Ladmo variety show.  Sadly, I never did, but I'll happily settle for MacAlpine's tribute to my childhood.  The specs:  a scoop of mint chocolate ice cream, a scoop of chocolate malt crunch ice cream, and a scoop of cookies n' cream ice cream, topped with hot fudge, whipped cream, sprinkles, chopped nuts, and of course the obligatory cherry on top.  I didn't fully appreciate how big this was until it was put in front of me.  Yeah, not meant for just one person.  That said, every bite was delicious and out of sheer stubbornness I did in fact finish it.  Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to about $25.  For the amount of food I got it, that's a pretty fair price, but like I said the quality of the non-dessert food was underwhelming.  And unfortunately the staff seemed a bit disorganized as I witnessed the staff up front get a number of people's orders mixed up or just plain incorrect.  I didn't experience this myself but my meatloaf did take awhile.  So perhaps skip the lunch and dinner here.  But by all means come for the desserts, come for the nostalgia and the volumes of antiques, and even come for the history.  I mean, how many 88 year old soda fountains do you know of anyway?",

    "text": "Another place on my wish list to visit. After reading other reviews I have been hesitant to visit but now glad I did. The interior is very interesting and worth a visit to see the counter, booths, and antiques everywhere. The ice cream soda combinations are phenomenal and we both enjoyed what we ordered. I loved my German chocolate cake soda and hubby went with the Irish eyes are smiling. YUMMY! He went with the Bogart/ a roast beef sandwich with a side of potato salad. I had the \"toasted\" cheese sandwich with a side of potato salad. Both were equally good and for dessert, we could not resist taking it a step further with homemade apple pie ala mode. So many vintage things to look at as they have a Vintage clothing and retro store attached! Go for ice cream sodas! Go for a small meal. Go for the history and go shopping for something funky for your home or office. I think it would be a great place to take out of town guests to. Only a few booths are available so time your visit or sit at the counter. But keep this place open for its nostalgia and contribution to our area.",

Warning : there are no prices anywhere!! I'm finally leaving after about twenty minutes and  had  to remind them I have yet to pay.  MY BAD!  I should've just left.    For a normal banana malt no whip cream no sprinkles nor cherry the price came to $8.67!!!!    WOW!!!!   I could make 10 banana malts at home for 9 bucks.     What a joke!  What  am I paying for???

No signs on the outside, no warning until we're in and heading for the table, and we realize, \"There's a guy, stumping for Mayor of Phoenix, and he's going to just talk the entire lunch hour.\"  So this means we can either enjoy conversation with our friends or we can sit and eat quietly while an unelected politician tells us why we shouldn't trust elected politicians.  Problem 2: Very dry chicken.  Seriously, I think they stuck a frozen Wal-Mart chicken breast in the microwave and nuked it for 8 minutes or something.  How hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good?  So now I get to try to choke down dry chicken and terrible political speeches at the same time.  Problem 3:  The candidate finally quits talking.  Then he takes a photo standing between the waitresses and says, \"It's like beauty on the outside, and beast on the inside.\"  No one laughs.  But then the owner comes up to our table as we're finally getting the chance to talk to each other, and she spends another 15 minutes telling us why we should vote for a certain party and why she wants to move into Phoenix from her home in Fountain Hills.  My favorite line: \"We need to make it harder for folks to drive so that they start using public transportation.\"  But of course, she's not using the light rail on her way in from Fountain Hills.  She just wants the people off her streets when she's trying to drive in and out of the city.  The only good thing about the whole trip--apart from our friends, who are awesome--was that the waitresses were professional and competent.  They earned a good tip and they treated us well.",

I wasn't disappointed with the atmosphere of the place. Quaint, clean and tastefully covered in antiques and collectibles, it takes you back to a slower, simpler time. I loved the fact that you could purchase most of the charming pieces and for what seemed like a really decent price!  Now about the food. It was alright, but everything tasted fairly bland. (Maybe just an off night. I don't know.) I tried the potato salad that people on yelp rave about and didn't think it was anything to die for. Your only choices are a few sandwiches, hot dogs and a burger which I felt we might have appreciated more for a light lunch than for dinner.  The dessert was yummy and HUGE and since it was a birthday occasion, it was free! We ordered a two scoop sundae that was more than enough for two people. Their soda menu is really impressive and not for the faint of heart. They have lots of yummy combos if you like sodas and ice cream together. I've never been a fan of mixing these things (they are perfectly wonderful all by themselves!) but seriously, if you enjoy floats, this is the place for you!  Customer service, ambiance and dessert were all pretty good, earning this sweet historic gem 3 stars.",

There was a lovely relaxed vibe, an old-style jukebox, a soda fountain from which you could have any number of tasty concoctions, and great menu selection.  There's even a little vintage shop tacked onto the side which you have to pass through to use the rest rooms...I loved it!

Our small group likes the intimacy of booths, and MacAlpine's doesn't disappoint with their tall booths (with integrated coat racks... for Phoenix!).  Lots of nostalgia everywhere, including the adjacent shops with \"antique\" items from years past.  You can just tell that many of the decorations are original, and the soda fountain is definitely authentic, as well.  We ate light that day - chicken salad sandwich w/ potato salad for me, Malibu chicken and BLT w/ soup for my companions.  We were served quickly, the bread and produce was fresh, and the iced tea was brewed, not from the fountain (yay!). It's standard lunch fare here, nothing fancy, but the kitchen moves the orders out and the staff is always watchful for empty glasses.  The '50's period wear for the servers is fun, but it's their attitude that makes the difference.  Great place for kids!  What's truly remarkable about this place is the assortment of distracting items from your childhood that forgot even existed, from the candy cigarettes for sale at the front, to the household items you see through glass in the adjacent antique shops. It's fun to have exposure to contraptions you don't see in the stores anymore, and that's why this place is a destination.",

Service is a little slow, but we received our order very fast. We both enjoyed our burgers very much! Very juicy, and cooked perfect! I really liked the potato salad, the daughter is very hard to please! She liked the potato's but she had to pick through the rest of the ingredients! She was ecstatic about being able to create her own shake! She ordered a banana and cheesecake shake, she usually only eat part of it and give the rest away! I was lucky enough to at least try it before she consumed the whole thing!!! Very tasty! I had their fresh lemonade, this was probably the best lemonade I have ever had!!! We really enjoyed this place and definitely will bring mama here.",

This place feels like it should belong in an older city; a rare find for Phoenix.  Specialty soda fountain and ice cream items are what to come for; they do these well.  Lunch is acceptable, but not exciting by any means.  I find the food here to be bland and uninspiring, but not terrible.  This place would be well served by a menu redesign.  Nevertheless, I love the atmosphere, and will likely return for the nostalgic factor.",

There are several more restaurants or cafes in the area that are good places to go, but MacAlpine's is the one that will keep bringing me back over and over. It's certainly a real taste of nostalgia. In addition to the great food, the real draw is the atmosphere and ambience that you immediately get when you walk in the door. The old soda fountain (in working order), all of the retro furniture, antiques, vintage clothing, and friendly waitresses who dress the part. It's worth the trip if you want to step back in time, take it easy, and enjoy a bit of the past!",

He got the chef's special: a bratwurst with sauerkraut and provalone on a toasted bun, and a tiger's blood phosphate--I took a sip of the phosphate and it was so intense and delicious.  We were both really full when we were done and the total for each of us came out to about ten dollars.  The servers were great, but disorganized.  We looked around the antique shop afterward and I bought a skirt for six dollars on sale. There is so much great stuff there--I wanted to take home every couch! And there are awesome time pieces in the two areas full of clothes.  I'm going to tell everyone I know about this place!",

The place is kind of curiously arranged, with a vintage store consuming several store fronts and the dining in the middle... so that I had to walk thru the dining area to reach different sections of the shopping.  But that helps to keep this place really laid back and casual.  At the soda bar, I saw several families just hanging out at the counter and sharing a sundae.  It looks to be the perfect local hangout spot. The vintage store is pretty popular as well--with usual mix of curiosity seekers and treasures hunters.   I personally didn't find anything that I would want to take home, but it was nice browsing nonetheless.  I definitely plan to visit again and bring the kids!",

When you walk in you can sit on one of the stools at the original bar and one of the lovely folks there will make the drink or ice cream desert of your dream.  A fizz, an egg cream, a malt or even a simple Dr Pepper float.  You name it, they can make it.  The ice cream deserts rock in their simplicity.    There are some very cool original booths still left, and some extra seating in the back.  It's not a huge place by any means, but I've never had to wait for a table - even when they were a stop on the First Friday bus route.  Folks who came by acted like they were in a museum - just looking at all the cool stuff - some of which is for sale - and left.  They have NO idea what they were missing out on here.    The ONLY thing that makes the place not get 5 stars is that they don't offer french fries.  Their burgers are awesome - but without the fries, I stick more to their amazing BLT or their messy but good good egg salad.  Both of those go great with their potato salad - which I think is one of the best ever.    The absolute best part?  We had 2 meals, 2 flavored drinks and 2 deserts and it cost less than $25.  Bam baby.",

The service can be a hit and miss depending on who you get as a server and when you go.  The ice cream and soda treats are fantastic!  The ambiance ~ the soda bar is cool and there are two side rooms full of antiques that are for sale everywhere.    I've had their Reuben which was A-OK and on my last trip I sampled their burger and chips with chocolate shank which was shank-a-licious!!   My burger was cooked well, but nothing fancy.  I also had a small salad which was nice but not memorable.  My shake was really good and left an indelible impression on my taste buds.   Side note: \"Give the dude out front holding the sign \"We are open for Lunch\" a break and let him come inside where it's a little cooler.  Use a curbside sign instead.  If you're a germ-o-phobe, like me that doesn't like dirty old things hanging everywhere especially where you are eating, you need to get past that and give MacAlpine's Soda Fountain a try.",

And, they even have a whole vintage shop inside, right when you walk in. It's a cool trip down memory lane, even if you're young. Up until recently, I wasn't aware of all the different vegetarian items they have. That's important to me, and so that was a cool surprise. The staff is sometimes coolly detached, but that's not a bad thing. Anything the spot \"lacks\" is compensated for with the employees' FUN HUMOR and great customer service. If you need a recommendation... just ask. It's worth it. Don't go with \"regular\" here... try some of their \"non-traditional\" items. I'm not sure how many of these dishes are from the soda fountain era. BUT... the flavors are always great. (They have funny names for most of the items.) Kids would love this place. Last thing, the management is reasonable. So if you need something, or are curious about something, ask them. They love talking about their business.",

What many patrons do not know is that the owners purchased this business shortly before 9/11 and were advised by friends to unload it because it did not have potential for an ROI.  They ignored the advice, poured their heart and soul into it, and are a huge reason why there are 83 reviews sitting here for your perusal.  Their fortitude is a gift for which Phoenix should be grateful.  These guys absolutely knocked themselves out for our event!  And it didn't matter that it was August and the A/C was not made to accommodate the crowd we brought in.  People stayed, ate, shopped the vintage store, and had a great time.  I still have the candy cigarettes Monica gave me as a party favor, and I smile every time they catch my eye on the kitchen counter.

You hardly know it's a restaurant because of all the antiques.  Once inside it is a very quaint place which has a lot of memorabilia in it and tons of antiques if that's your thing.  A little too dusty for my liking.  The food is what we went for but I was disappointed. My husband had a cheeseburger which he said was good but not the best he ever had.  There are some sides offered like potato salad for example which was tasty.  I had the \"Bird\", which was a turkey burger.  First off it is a frozen tasteless pre-made patty.  No seasoning at all and it had the \"I've been in the freezer way too long\" taste.  I hate that taste.  Nothing worse than freezer burnt meat. I added salt and pepper and mustard to try and hide that \"taste\" but it wasn't happening.  Don't order the turkey burger because you will be disappointed.  I had a sparkly lemonade with no spark.  Very flat.  My husband had a chocolate malt.  Again he said it was good but not the best he ever had.  And it was definitely not worth the 6 buck price tag!  Service was ok.  We won't be going back.

It was dreadful.  They are not even trying to make it good.  I would forgive them if they made an effort, but based on all of the other negative comments about the food you would think they might try to step it up a notch.  They have been in business forever and good for them.  If you go, go for the atmosphere, go for the soda fountain, skip the food.",

Our desserts were good but I though the kids menu desserts were pretty large to be from the kids menu. Got our check and seen that the \"kids\" desserts were so large because the server rang in adult sundaes instead of kids. When my husband asked her about it she was rude and said she did us a favor by charging us for one scoop and giving us two. We told her that we ordered the kids size which was suppose to be much cheaper but she argues that she rang it up as an adult one because it's a better deal. ($3 more than the kids one). We just paid and left as it wasn't worth arguing over but we will not be back to a place that just charges you whatever they feel like to get more money. Felt like we were getting ripped off a little. It's a shame that the server ruined our experience.",

When you first walk in, it smells like your Grandma's closet as the diner sits between two sides of their vintage/antique wares. But for those of us that like vintage junk/treasures, it was a neat atmosphere. It's like finding a little gold mine somewhere you don't expect it.   \"I LOVE HER HAIR\" was the first thing I said as we entered the diner. The waitresses looked super cute in their outfits and pinup style hair. I didn't get her name but one had beautiful black hair with the biggest victory rolls and it looks amazing. So at this point, I'm already pleased. The food probably could have been bad, and I would have still liked the place.   We were passed the drinks/sodas/shakes/malt menu and it was extensive. As a Scentsy rep, my friend was like....\"It's just like Scentsy, so many to choose from!\" I decided on a blackberry shake as I use to get them as a girl back home in Washington. It was YUMMY!  We both ordered the Pastrami Reuben for lunch on sourdough rather than rye and had the potato salad as a side. The potato salad was divine. Great flavor, consistency, and appeal. The sandwich was good too. Nothing super fabulous but a good standard Reuben.  We chatted, admired the stuff all over the walls, and strolled around the store afterwards looking at stuff.   I throughly enjoyed my trip to MacAlpine's and will be going back with my daughter to try the dill pickle shake as she's obsessed with pickles!",

We visited for lunch with older native Phoenix family members. Hoping to enjoy a trip down memory lane. Unfortunately, the poor quality food overshadowed the nostalgia. Seven of us ordered lunch. We had heard the burgers were excellent. They are not. Honestly, I've had better fast food burgers - and I don't care for fast food. The patty actually tasted like it was pulled from the freezer and thrown on the flattop. The side of potato salad was passable.   The pulled pork sandwich was unremarkable.   The stuffed tomato was unimpressive. The BLT was just okay.   On the other hand, the club with added avocado was tasty.   We might consider returning for dessert only, but it won't be our first choice.   The grasshopper sundae was tasty, but there were ice chunks in the ice cream.   A note on the service: it was a bit slow, despite us feeling rushed in the beginning. More noticeable (and annoying) was the phony, \"customer service \" voice our waitress used. There was no detectable authenticity.   Also, although an 18% gratuity was added to our party of seven, the cashier asked if we wanted to leave an additional tip. That created an uncomfortable moment because the service didn't even merit the 18%.",

The restaurant was an old fashioned soda pop type of restaurant... everything there was like it would have been back in the 50's... for lunch I had the Reuben & my cousin had the Malibu Chicken Sandwich and others had pulled-pork sandwich (not pictured) & grilled cheese & tomato sandwich (not pictured).... plus dessert....

The white tables and chairs are a bit flimsy so sit in a booth if you need more stability.

Here, it feels like I'm shopping on Etsy after the shop owner has hiked up the price by over 50 percent of what they paid. Definitely worth a visit, but you have to be willing to pay more than what you'd pay for something new. Just because something is old doesn't mean it should be priced as though it is rare!",

I am entirely thrilled that my wife found and suggested this place. The food is on point, the portions are as they should be. Fresh ingrediants coupled with quality cooking and amazing staff, you cannot go wrong here. Everything tasted amazing and my kids killed their dishes.   We will be back",

    "text": "Awful.  First impression:  bad.  Two of the front windows were broken, and at first glance all that was visible were the two thrift stores that bookend the \"restaurant\".    The eating section looked quaint at first: clearly the original counter with lots of interesting items wreathed around it.  But upon closer look, the counter was in disrepair, trim had fallen off in places, and shelves were missing, requiring supplies and table settings to not only be displayed, but piled in a jumble on the surviving shelves in full view of customers.  Worse, the jukebox was broken which we only found out after we already wasted 2 bits.  Service:  terrible.  The wait staff was young and in need of training.   Our waiter didn't write down our order and had to ask 3 questions because he forgot.  Then two mistakes still were made with the order including an incorrect entree served.  There was a large table behind us our waiter also was serving and I overheard that a child's order was completely forgotten.  Dude, just write it down!  You're not ready for a big boy server gig, it's okay.  Food:  deplorable.   Other reviews correctly assess the embarrassing \"hamburgers\", but the fountain drinks (we had the root beer float and Breakfast at Tiffany's ) were weak sauce (literally).  I had the Ruben with potato salad which was decent, but I was pretty hungry and would have eaten anything.  I would have preferred fries but they weren't in the menu, no deep fryer either ?  Overall the ambience was that of a David lynch movie spliced with \"The Road\".  Clearly the brainchild of a spinster with dementia, this place may have seemed quaint in some rim town 20 years ago ,  but on Central Ave in PHX in 2014?  Bizarre.  Or rather bazaar, because you are eating a dubious meal surrounded by moth eaten clothes, rusty metal, and grubby rummage sale items.  The only thing missing are shouting fishmongers.",

Ive been here a few times for birthday friend events and they definitely know how to take care of you.  The staff is helpful and will go out of their way to make sure you are happy.  They specialize in their many flavors of soda.. and by many, I mean probably 150 plus.  if you dont know what you like, they will recommend a nice variety of popular drinks.  Their desserts are also popular and can easily be shared.  So be careful!  the only thing I wasn't a fan of is that they do not have a frier, so there are no fried foods like fries.  The dining part feels like it's run with a swamp cooler, so be prepared to sweat just a little if there are a bunch of people there.  They do have about 20 fans blowing all over to keep you cool.  On both sides of the restaraunt they have some pretty cool antique shops with prices that are pretty decent.  I highly recommend checking it out.",

I love that the employees dress and do their hair to match the old school decor. The soda list is impressive, although I opted for a traditional root beer float (oldie but a goodie), and was very happy with their classic take on it. My friend ordered a chocolate soda and black cherry ice cream float, which she loved.   The food menu is simple, but I'm okay with that because obviously the shining star of MacAlpine's is their dessert lists.   Be mindful of what time you go, they close up shop pretty early during the week.",

The shop is cuter than I expected with many interesting antiques for sale spanning 3 (maybe more?) rooms. The prices for the antiques seemed to be fair or more than fair when compared to other antique shops in the neighborhood. The soda fountain portion of the restaurant is cute and set up like an old diner. I don't know about eating food here, but the ice cream was good. I tried the turtle sundae which was tasty.... nothing crazy, but good. The husband had the root beer float, which he enjoyed and my mom had some mint chip, which she liked. Overall it was good, nothing mind blowing, but solid. The service was friendly and efficient. The prices were on par with other ice cream places. I would go back if I wanted an old style sundae, but I couldn't see myself frequenting this place (seemed like more of a family place).",

    "text": "After hearing numerous things about MacAlpine's from friends and other Yelpers, my boyfriend and I decided to pop in.  We both ordered the Toasted Cheese Sandwich (grilled cheese w/ 3 types of cheese) and I was really disappointed with it. Mostly because I was expecting fries as a side and they don't serve them but also because the cheese was not the least bit melted. When I bit into my sandwich I expected strands of hot, gooey cheese to stretch in front of my face but instead I opened up my sandwich to find 3 slices of cheese barely stuck together and still in perfect squares. Buuuut I'm not really one to complain. I ate what I could and asked myself what I really expected. After all, it's only a grilled cheese. And that's not what MacAlpine's is known for...  They're known for their sodas. Which are everything they're made out to be. After much deliberation,  I ordered the Nutty Professor Ice Cream soda (Pistachio ice cream w/ Amaretto soda) and it was delicious! I'll definitely be back to try the Red Velvet Soda. And maybe the Parisian ice cream soda. Or maybe just the entire dessert menu.  Perhaps my favorite part of our visit was the thrift/antique store. They have an amazing selection of treasures. I spent $50 on old photos for my assemblage art and wished I had won the lottery so I could afford all the vintage cameras, shoes, toys, and lamps. Definitely a little pricey in some areas but justly so. The owner doesn't mess around when selecting pieces for the shop.",

I had the bacon cheeseburger I know I know you are thinking how can you mess up a cheeseburger especially one with bacon on it.  I was thinking the same thing, but the patty was frozen and lacking any flavor of juiciness.  A burger is supposed to be juicy and full of flavor due to the fat melting into the meat.  This was a greyish color flavorless disc of supposed beef.    The only reason I gave two stars is the ice cream soda I had was good.  I had the pineapple upside down cake and I would actually go back just for that.  It's just hard to go back to a restaurant when all you want is a drink.",

I like to linger and hang out due to the charming, lived-in atmosphere, the forgotten Andrews Sisters hits on the stereo, and the people-watching.  This is a place where you (I) go for certain things only.  I'm not a huge fan of the food because it's not my style.  It's the kind of stuff my grandmother fixed for lunch on summer vacations.  Plain, old fashioned fare.  If you are nostalgic for white bread and mayo, then get to MacAlpine's NOW.  That said, I have had some good sandwiches there, and I like a place that doesn't serve unnecessarily gigantic portions of food.  The service is always very friendly and pleasant, and they have some good stuff in the two antiques shops on either side of the restaurant.    Here is what I want from MacAlpine's:  Get a website! Oh my god!  (& when you do, put your menu on it)  And secondly, I'm pretty sure they don't serve espresso drinks right now, despite the fact that I believe I have noticed an espresso machine behind the counter.  If I'm right about that, I should be proven wrong post haste.  I would really like to be able to get lattes at MacAlpine's, because I'm just not a malt, phosphate or egg cream kind of lady.",

    "text": "Oh, I'm sure you've visited a handful soda shops and diners that are strategically spruced up to give the illusion that they're retro. Well, with Macalpine's, there's no illusion. It's legitimate. I mean, the place has been in business since 1929, which is quite a testament in a modern-obsessed city like Phoenix.   Macalpine's appeal has always lied within its nostalgia. And I think it's safe to say that sweets are definitely their main attraction. There many things you can order, such as an eggcream or phosphate, which only those familiar with previous eras will probably recognize.   Of course, the ice cream sodas are the default choice and with good reason. There's various creations, or you are free to come up with your own soda flavor and ice cream combination. All ice cream is from Thrifty, which is enough to make most people pretty happy.  In addition to the actual restaurant, there's also a thrift store that sells various used items. I've never bought anything, but enjoy browsing. An archaic dentist chair, cigarette machine, and old school irons. I consider the place an homage to a time when home appliances weren't all made out of plastic. There's also a room entirely dedicated to clothing, which I often imagine is where kids take their grandparents' wardrobes after they die.  What I feel really hurts Macalpine's potential to be this ultra-cool hipster hotspot is the food itself. While nothing is terrible by any means, I've always secretly wished that they'd adopt an approach similar to Welcome Diner by executing on a higher level and developing relationships with local purveyors. Honestly, with a bit more effort in the food department, combined with its retro charm, I can see this place really taking on a whole new life. But sadly, that just isn't the direction they're going in. For food recommendations, I think the Mac's Clubhouse is probably one of your best choices.  Despite my complaints, it's still a nice place to visit every now and again for an ice cream soda and quick meal. My parents, when visiting out-of-town, always request to visit here as one of their top choices, so they must be doing something right.  Check them out!",

I recently visited the area & chose this place to meet with some relatives in the area. Food is terrific, ice cream is sublime, & their selection of ice cream sodas is massive. Service was also pretty friendly & quick. I'd definitely recommend it & will go back next time I'm in the area.",

The menu is completely overwhelming, as it sports a large number of phosphates, sundaes, and frozen treats. We settled on the Mud Pie and were practically drooling when we saw the fudge get poured on - it was absolutely mouthwatering. The world of ice cream does not get better than this. With handmade ice cream, attentive soda jerks, and the atmosphere to boot, this is a must for all Phoenix residents.",

It's great for all ages, which isn't always True for antique places. Prepare to reward children (and yourself) with ice cream. But just being here is a treat.  I enjoyed walking around and browsing through old records and fun vintage clothes. They'll let you play their antique pianos, too! If a guy took me on a first date here, I would immediately consider marriage.   I had the pulled pork sandwich and a cherry coconut malted with peanut butter (don't judge). Our table's food came within 10 minutes of ordering and it was delicious. My bun was freshly toasted and the coleslaw was crispy, not goopy, and classic.

There are 99 flavors for your cream sodas, italian sodas, shakes, phosphates (phosphoric acid is included to give a flat sour taste) as well as egg creams (milk, choc syrup, and soda water).  The flavors range from bubble gum and marshmallow to pickle and hurricane.  Mac's also has its own signature concoctions.  Sundaes and banana splits are also on the menu, and for an average of $5 it is definitely worth it.  I just would not recommend coming here to eat.

The food was fine but I won't lie it could certainly be better. We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for my son and it came out with one of the pieces of bread being the butt end of the loaf. Come on!!!    The service started off pretty good but as the place seemed to get busier our waitress seemed to disappear into the abyss. There are only so many seats in this place so please staff appropriately.   The ice cream/soda is certainly the star of the show and the reason to come here. I went standard issue vanilla milkshake and couldn't be happier by wide ordered some pink concoction and was thrilled with it. My son got a green ninja drink and was wired with sugar delight for the next 3 hours.   I will come back here I just won't order food next time.",

Have been going here since I was a kid and every time I fall back in love with their food and vintage setting. The food is hands down delicious. The burgers are good, they perfectly melt in your mouth. Their club sandwich is huge and always fresh. Any kind of their malts, ice cream, soda fountain drinks, italian sodas are all made to perfection and with the variety of flavors that they have it's crazy how right on they are with the flavor. With my food I always order the potato salad. I'm very picky with my potato salad, but I can say that I've stopped by JUST to have a bowl of potato salad (more than once probably).   Other than the great food you can explore their cute little store on both sides of the building. You'll always find something that you can't just live without. I think it's the whole \"vintage\" thing, but who knows?   The girls are always dressed up in their cute attire and play the part very well, very impressive :) Thank you MacAlpine's for being located down the street from me, and playing a huge part of my childhood life. :)))",

The store portion had all kinds of goodies ranging from retro furniture that was sitting in your grandparents house to old school clothes, hats, barbies, dishes... ALL kinds of knick knacks!!   We ate lunch here and that is the only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars. I had the Mac Cheeseburger and it was OK... nothing special. The hawaiian cole slaw was ehhh too, a little dry for my taste. They had probably over 100 different \"sodas\" I ordered the hubba bubba soda which was flavored soda (or syrup) with strawberry ice cream. I wish I had ordered a regular flavored soda like a good old fashioned Cherry Coke! This place was awesome! It had such a fun retro vibe!",

I will definitely be going back for another black bean burger! The price was phenomenal at just $6.50.  My fiance was not crazy about the chili burger that he had, but next time he'll pick something different. We also had a great mint chocolate shake!  I love the decor and ambiance.

Well truthfully, they have so many ice cream soda flavors, there might be a bacon one.  But you won't find it in the Thrifty ice cream!  You'll take a step back in time once you walk through the doors.  Floats, shakes, sundaes, malts, sodas, egg creams, and phosphates.  They're all here.  I don't even know what an egg cream is, but I would guess I would like it.  The cherry phosphate was also a first for me.  I'm still not sure what to think of it.  Kind of medicinal at first, but the more you drink, the more you like it.  The vanilla malt was vanilla-ey and malty.  What else can you say?",

The food is good, a little simple for my taste and price range, but my boyfriend loves it. The potato salad is great. He likes the food (but he likes simple stuff like sandwiches and hot dogs), but his favorite is definitely the soda.  They have a HUGE menu of different types of drinks.   Very nice place to have a treat, but if you're going to get just one thing, definitely get a dessert rather than a meal. Their sundaes are huge, too! So good!",

I didn't see all the descriptions on the menu of all the different types of drinks, she answered all my questions with a smile and chuckled with me when I saw the page that said everything she had just told me about. She convinced me to stay away from the usual root beer float and try something different, (sour cherry soda and vanilla icecream) which I did, and was VERY pleased. I had the Sloppy Joe with potato salad and carrot salad and my daughter had the BEST Pb&J sandwich we've ever had. Overall a fun visit.",

Well, that's a challenge that must be honored. We didn't expect a journey into yesteryear.  Take a seat, Don Draper, any seat. Feel familiar? This place looks like it would be a set dresser's dream for a movie flashback. There is also clothing from the 40s to the 60s, and even some troubling 80s fashions that I may  have owned myself. Shoulder pads, gah!  We settled into some very stiff seats and ordered from an interesting menu. It had conventional offerings like cheeseburgers and BLTS but also vegetarian fare. My husband ordered a delicious cream of mushroom soup and BLT and he is a fan for life. He also ordered a caramel green apple soda. The service was wonderful.   This is definitely a fun place to walk around and spend some time on a full belly. Two thumbs up.",

I understand things being busy at all but nobody even acknowledged that I even walked in until after 20 minutes when I had to ask if I could see a menu. I then flagged someone down to place my order because I knew if I waited on them it probably would have been another 20 minutes. After another 20 minutes I asked the waitress if I should come another time. She assured me that it would be done in 5 minutes, which it was, and that would have been nice if only I got what I actually ordered. I asked for a shake, nearly 45 minutes later I got a cream soda.

He came by & dropped off 2 waters (um, there's 4 of us.) We just shrugged it off & ordered. My mom ordered a sundae, my dad, husband & I ordered floats. He dropped them off & we never saw him again. He was actually ignoring us. I was so embarrassed that I picked this place! The floats were just okay, very artificial tasting.  We finally went up to the front & the cashier asked where our ticket was, we explained we didn't have one so she also gave us a sigh of annoyance & went to find our server. Well excuse us for spending $30 on ice cream! You'd think with those prices the service would be much better. We'll take our money somewhere else next time.",

I had the Coney dog and added bacon to it $.95 extra which is excessive. The meat in the chilli was a low grade beef with no flavor and when I get chilli on a hot dog I don't want beans. My dog had so much chilli that it had to be served open and I had to use a knife and fork to eat. Plus I am not sure whether it was from the pickle or not but there was some kind of juice that soaked the bun. Probably won't be back unless we have a visitor that wants to go.",

The only flaw I have found with this place is the hours of operation...they close really early which is horrible when the late night sweet tooth hit.  Great place to go on a hot day or on the weekends...especially if you like soda.",

Essentially, all the furniture, counter, and fixings of the place have been there since 1928. Hell, even our waiter looked like Fatty Arbuckle. If a place manages to stay alive and well for over 80 years in this city that loves to chew up and spit out its historical locales, you've got to give that joint props (Sing High being the exception to that rule).  The cuisine at MacAlpine's is what you'd expect: old fashioned and American. It's nothing spectacular. What really makes the trip however is their soda selection. They've got something like over fifty flavors. I tried out the Blueberry Cheesecake flavored one and my friend was treated to \"The Wrestler\": a weird/delicious combination of some cherry flavoring and some thing else that tasted like Dr. Pepper.   In conclusion, this place is a landmark worthy of it's reputation garnered. Its service, vibe, and overall offerings are a testament as to why it's still standing after eight decades.",

    "text": "Was excited to try this place, looked like so much fun...a soda fountain mixed with old \"stuff\" to shop. The vintage shopping was the highlight, cool things from jewelry to furniture and great clothes. Can not comment on food as we only tried the shakes. Our waitress was disinterested and seemed annoyed to be waiting on us after she figured out that is all we wanted. The shake had 5 inches of whip cream, which is great if I wanted a whip cream shake, scooped it off, as wanted to try the actual shake and that seemed to further annoy the waitress, as result took forever for her to come and remove dirty things. Shake was just okay...took my dad as thought he would get a kick out of the place. His comment was \"when does the strawberry flavor kick in?\" meaning the shake had no flavor.  -if I am going to splurge on another shake though, sorry this will not be the place, giant hamburger on Lindsay has the best. And the staff are phenomenal....always friendly. Sorry wanted to like this place...the other staff seemed nice enough and I think one of the other girls noticed and tried to make better when we checked out...so at least they tried. But won't return for the food or shakes. I will stop to peruse antiques again after I eat at one of the other restaurants along the same street.",

Those girls work their tails off.  Everything we had was fresh.  No, it's not fancy or complicated, but you wouldn't come here for that.  Good burger.  My friend has the chef salad- she said spot on crunchy and fresh.  Some good fries would be my only suggestion to round out their 50s menu- they only offer chips.",

Authentic, amazing service, and the whole fact that they have an antique store really helped make this place shine.   We had a simple dessert that consisted of 2 Phosphorus's and a hot fudge sundae, and after wards, I felt bloated and diabetic. That's because for the prices, you get a surprising amount of deliciousness. You feel like a little kid when your kind, humorous, tattooed server brings you a MASSIVE sundae cup, dripping with hot fudge and all of the toppings.   The only, and I mean, THE ONLY drawback, is that I live so far away from them. On the other side, I guess that means I won't be gaining 20 pounds anytime soon.",

    "text": "After volunteering downtown (a few months back), we were ready for lunch, and wanted to try somewhere new and exciting. We had an Entertainment coupon book with hundreds of restaurant choices and Landed here. We walked in 5 minutes before opening. The doors for the Shop side were open so the staff could set out some sidewalk sale items, and the gal working greeted us, and invited us to browse the shop, and asked us to give the restaurant a few minutes. So we did just that.  We step over to the restaurant and They offer us to have a seat wherever we would like. Since we have never been here and I Love Old time Things, we sat at the Fountain counter to take a peek and snap a photo! There was a gentleman working behind the fountain that definitely was fit for the ambiance, and he knew the business history pretty well. We grab a seat at one of the tables, which was on the smaller side, but you have to remember this business was built in 1929 and things were smaller then. So, The wait staff was friendly and that guy at the fountain took our order. We found out it was only his second day, but we couldn't tell! I'm not able to recall our exact order, But I think I got the Reuben, and it was alright. We tried a Root beer Float, but with Chocolate Ice cream (there is a name for this that I can not recall, and it was a recommended item). I'm not a fan of root beer floats so this was on the sweeter side for me.  We had a 14 year girl in our party, and she had most of it. My friend ordered a Cherry Coke, which was made from scratch, and again not a fan of Cherry Soda's. But my goodness, This soda was Delicious!  Not overly Cherry tasting like you get from anywhere else. I want to go back just to sit at the Bar and  have a cherry coke! I love that this is a Soda Fountain, and what it stands for! I've only been once but I recommend it to everyone to check out! I give 4 stars due to the fact that the food menu could have a bit more options.",

It just made me sick that we spent $50 dollars on such a truly bad meal.  The malts were good.  It took us getting through 3/4 of our meal before they came though.  The wait staff was two college age girls that you could tell didn't give a rip if the customer was getting good service.  Go there for a malt or shake and call it good.  Everything else sucked.",

The bar at the soda fountain was incredible too & it's been around since 1929! The wooden booths in the restaurant were neato too.  Cons= Walked in on a wednesday night at 6:30 and felt obligated to hurry out.. the employees were not very welcoming & when i asked the time they close,they said 7.  I don't care if it's 5 minutes before close..be courteous to customers..it's the holiday season.  I asked if it was too late to order food & the young girl said \"no\".(then looked at her friend and smirked like it was an issue or out of the way for her). I felt bad,so i didn't bother to get a shake or anything..shame because i heard they have great desserts made from Thriftys ice cream :/  .  They need to hire employees who are more knowlegable with antiques. I think they should hire veterans who need jobs & perhaps grew up in the 40's or served in the vietnam war who enjoys talking about old times & appreciates talking about retro stuff.   O well",

The surrounding area has changed quite a bit, but inside MacAlpine's Soda Fountain it's still 1929.   Lunch and dinner selections include comfort food classics such as meatloaf, burgers, sloppy joe's, and egg salad sandwiches. Don't forget to try a malt shake, phosphate soda, egg cream, or soda in one of the 30-something flavors (from sarsaparilla to bubble gum)!   We came here on a Saturday and our group sampled the chocolate malt shake ($5.50), Sloppy Joe ($6.95), Pastrami Rueben Sandwich ($7.50), and a small sundae in one of the old wooden booths. All Sandwiches are served with your choice of Potato Salad, Hawaiian Cole Slaw, Carrot Raisin Salad, Carrot & Celery Sticks or Potato Chips. The Hawaiian Cole Slaw appeared to be missing the \"Hawaiian\" part of the dish but the potato salad was good as was the carrot raisin salad.   This is a fun restaurant to visit with out of town guests or families with kids that want to enjoy a sundae with the little ones.",

I stopped by for two milk shakes to go and it took over 20 minutes for the girls to make the shakes and then another 5 plus minutes just to check out.    They were not busy... just scatter brained, inattentive, and oblivious.  Sweet kids work here but the SERVICE IS AWEFUL. They need a manager to keep everyone focused.     I was charged just over 11 dollars for 2 shakes... not sure if that was correct but I paid this balance as all I wanted to do was leave.  If you decide to trying this place out... have zero expectations.",

    "text": "THE SODAS ARE AWESOME!!! But not the Mac Chili Burger. Not tasty at all. Nope. But the sodas are great and ice cream is great. Thrifty brand if you are familiar with that brand (Rite-Aid). I had the \"Rhett Butler,\" chocolate soda with Chocolate Malt Krunch ice cream. Yum!  Really, the \"Mac Chili Burger\" left a LOT to be desired. The meat was dry and tough, the \"Hawaiian Cole Slaw\" was rather tasteless. The \"chili\" was made out of black beans. I like black beans. Not these. This was no chili. It was a very dry chili. I had three bites of this meal and I was done.  My daughter had the \"Mac Hot Dog.\" It was OK. Not spectacular. She said the bun tasted \"funny\" or \"different.\" $4.95. My wife had a salad. My son and his wife had the \"Mac Cheese Burger.\" He enjoyed it.  So...  FOOD 2 Stars And no french frys to be seen on the menu. This is a soda fountain. You would think.  AMBIANCE 5 Stars!!! This place is incredible. He has a huge store with lots of collectables from different eras, mostly from the 50s. Antique furniture. Antique and collectable clothes. Displays with old products. So cool. A real 45 rpm jukebox. You really need to see the soda fountain and the booths. I don't know where he got them, but the booths are wood and--how do I describe this--have this classy wood attachment/facade to the wall. Interesting stuff all around.  ICE CREAM TREATS 5 Stars!!! Already described the ice cream and the sodas. He has a gizillion flavors of sodas and has some menu items of ready-to-go combinations. But you can create your own with your own soda flavorings and your own ice cream flavors. The possibilities are endless.  Overall, you need to experience this.",

The portions were smaller than you'd expect, which my girlfriend suggested might be a harken back to the day. Problem is the prices aren't proportionate.  My pastrami and Swiss on marble rye was pretty burnt and fairly bland. The potato salad hardly had any flavor. I thought perhaps my taste buds were off except the root Beer float was pretty tasty.  Watching a waitress pickup spilled food off the floor with her bare hands, throw it away, then turn around and serve two plates to other customers did it for me.  The ice cream was good, but other places know how to scoop from a carton too...",

I *do* understand that we shouldn't have outside food, however, I explained to her that the 4 y/o won't eat anything but chicken nuggets. In my defense, I tried calling MacAlpine's prior to arriving to ask if they had chicken nuggets but no one picks up the phone. And the menu isn't online.   Nonetheless, I believe In supporting local business and the other 2 children (and me) were ready for dinner. I had talked this place up to the kids prior to entering but She rudely said we weren't allowed inside with the food.  It's hard to be with children and some times some of us need a little slack. I won't be back there as the food is mediocre and the ice cream is eh. Thanks for nothing Mac. (In disclosure, had the waitress not been so rude I wouldn't have written this review. Service matters.)",

The ice cream sodas are delicious; every time I visit I try a new one. The last time I was there I had a chocolate malt and I loved it. The pies are good, too! I was engaged here, and visited during my honeymoon. When I'm pregnant I will definitely have a \"pregnant moment\" ice cream soda. MacAlpine's is also a Pokestop for all those who play Pokemon Go. Enjoy an ice cream soda while using a lure module and I'm sure you'll become a fan. The antique store is also nice. MacAlpine's is quickly becoming a place for all ages.",

After you eat you can do a little vintage shopping. They also have tons of selections for sodas. This place is overall and relaxing and great place to eat.

The thrift store portions have some great stuff. A great vintage fashion section, LOTS of records (your parents remember those, kids), and some great jewelry.  The mini diner area has, what I believe is all the original booths and counter. The booths are kind of small, and though they all have jukeboxes on them, they all seemed to be out of order while we were here.  They serve very simple diner food (hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, grilled cheese, etc), but their real specialty is their sodas and ice cream floats. There is a pretty large selection of sodas to choose from. We all went for the \"suggested\" combinations. I cant remember what mine was called, but it was red white and blue. Strawberry and vanilla ice cream in blueberry soda. So good. Warning: within 3 seconds of my 1st sip my entire mouth was blue. And it only got blue-er (and spread to my lips) with every sip.   Id gladly brave the blue lips again for that delicious little step back in time.",

    "text": "MacAlpine's, established in 1929, is a Phoenix treasure. It was still an operating pharmacy and soda fountain as recently as 1991, at which time the pharmacy side of the business surrendered to new era competition. Fortunately, the soda fountain remains.   I'm awarding five stars, partly out of annoyance with snarky one and two star reviewers unaware of the spot's historical significance, but mainly out of love for MacAlpine's ice cream concoctions. Moreover, how can you not award five stars to the establishment where Wayne Newton was discovered in 1962? Note to the one and two star reviewers: Wayne Newton is an American singer and entertainer who is best known for his 1963 hit song Danke Schoen and more recently as a surgically enhanced Las Vegas headliner.  I must confess that I'm not a huge fan of the food at MacAlpine's. How often do you read that in a five star review? Let me clarify. The menu is fine, but why would you want to risk eating a Sloppy Joe and not leaving room for a sundae? Another note for prospective one and two star reviewers: The ice cream at MacAlpine's is not hand crafted. It's basic ice cream, served in a manner consistent with the tradition of a soda fountain. Just as it should be. If you want Sweet Republic or Churn like flavors, go to those establishments and please don't write a negative review for MacAlpine's.   MacAlpine's is amazingly kid friendly. Also friendly for anyone else who still has a little bit of kid within. There are roughly 100 flavors of soda from which to choose. One hundred!!! Want a sundae instead? How about Bears at the Beach, a Carousel or Dirt & Worms? They also have a variety of sundaes that cater more to adult tastes (if you must). Or instruct the waitress construct the customized treat of your dreams. The location on Seventh Street is an ideal stopping place before or after a downtown trip to the Science Center, a Dbacks game... Note to one and two star reviewers: Sure, there is a lot of dusty and worn old stuff on the premises. Just remember, you too will one day be old and worn if you're lucky enough to make it over 80 years (and it wouldn't be polite to point it out to you). I suggest you travel back in time and embrace MacAlpine's quirky nature. Be sure to budget a little extra time to enjoy the antique/vintage/retro store located on the premises as well.",

That said, I cannot recommend more strongly, the dill pickle sundae.  Yeah, I know, it sounds like there's no way that would work.  But it does!  The flavor is dominated by the vanilla ice cream with a slight and somewhat lingering hint of dill.  It really does work.  Ok, I admit it might not be for everyone, but try it.  Really. And if not, still, swing by this wonderful little slice of Americana if you find yourself up in Phoenix.  What a wonderful little place!",

    "text": "First of all, this place is ROASTING!  It's horrible.  How can an ice cream shop be so hot?  Looking around I don't see any air condition vents.  Don't tell me they have none?  It got a little better as I sat at the bar with fans aimed at me, but I am still in wonder at how they have lasted this long while being that hot inside!  Thankfully I'm just getting a root beer float.  I was offered water before it arrived.  The float's glass was nicely chilled, and I appreciated the tiny little chilled metal pitcher of extra root beer to top it off.  Ezra The ice cream had a nice strong vanilla extract flavor but was unfortunately icy (ice chunks within it).  Several of the wait staff asked me how it was as I consumed it, so I would say service is good here.  I am not a fan of the big blazingly hot non-air conditioned room of clutter when you walk in.  All but two of the booths were filled, and one of those was not bussed (dirty glasses on it), so the space could definitely be reconfigured to be more profitable by putting in more seating.  I sat at the bar, the furthest away from the broiling area surrounding the windows, but ended up sitting in front of the employees' hand washing sink.  The bar top itself is some type of weird old plastic material that is fades in many areas and cracked at the edges.  Overall it was a very decent float that was undoubtedly a step above Dairy Queen or A&W's soft serve version in quality.  The $6 after tax and tip price (I hadn't looked at a menu when I popped in and ordered it) was eyebrow raising though.",

They do a great job retaining the atmosphere of an age gone by, sandwiched on both sides by antique and vintage stores. There's plenty to look at. Unfortunately I can't say the burgers (turkey or cow) were very good. Not bad, just bland and uninspired. The sodas are fun. On my first visit I tried 2 of the 99 options, including Marilyn Monroe (peach) and Tiger Blood (cherry coconut). Both were good, but next time I'm going to ask for way less syrup. All in all I'd say I would come back again and again, but probably just for dessert.",

On the one hand, it gets 5 stars for the look and feel of the place, the phosphate soda and shake that made me wish I could expand like a tick, the jukebox and the chance to find cool shit to buy while you're eating (there's a chair there that WILL be mine, as soon as I move.  If any of you jerks go buy it before then, I'll come find you and claim what's mine).  On the other hand, my son and I each had a terrible, terrible hamburger and an extremely disinterested waitress.  The burger was so overdone, and i would bet a lot of money that it had been microwaved, based on the speed with which it was served and the taste.    So for now, Mac Alpine, you get 3 stars.  But I'm so enchanted with the idea of you, that I'll be back.  Maybe not to eat, but to enjoy a shake/phosphate/ice cream soda with a book?  You betcha.    Since the kid was here with me, I asked for his two cents:  \"It was pretty good.  It wasn't the best, but it was good\".  And he also gives it 3 stars.",

I had been warned by a friend that it was not worth going for lunch, as the food wasn't very good, but I was craving a hamburger and in the area, so to MacAlpine's I went. Once I figured out which door granted entrance to the diner (seriously, it took three tries),  I was greeted by some awfully pretty and very in-character waitresses. They were all dolled up, '50s style and had that sweetie-pie personality down pat. I admitted I wasn't too familiar with places that offer so many soda options and asked for a recommendation. The server gladly offered her favorites, and I went with her suggestion, a cherry cheesecake soda. It was fantastic. I looked over the menu and was immediately disappointed, why is a turkey burger featured above the all-American diner staple, the cheeseburger?! And no fries? I briefly considered the chili dog but that too was made with turkey ... what kind of throw back retro diner was this?? Damn. I got the cheeseburger and potato chips, which came out pretty quick and the burger was hot as all get out, fresh off the skillet ... definitely not a grill and that was just about the worst patty I've paid for in my life. Dry, flavorless, terrible. Well, I had been warned and can't exactly complain. Seeing as I'm not a soda drinker and wasn't a fan of the food, I won't be back. But the atmosphere and food quality would suit children well, and I saw several come and go, usually with their grandparents.",

    "text": "While vacationing in Phoenix, I found out that there was a local 50s-style diner. My husband and I are both into oldies music, so naturally we had to check it out! Initially the place caused confusion, as there were several entrances in a row, but we figured out we had to enter through an antique store. We loved all of the old stuff on display in the diner. The waitress was friendly and dressed for the era, albeit not in a poodle skirt. We asked for time to peruse the menu, as there were a mind-boggling amount of shake flavors to choose from. I opted to mix two flavors for my shake: passionfruit and black cherry, which turned out to be a scrumptious blend. My husband got coffee, but it tasted so weak that he swapped it out for blackberry. We were told it was weak because it had just been made with coffee ice cream rather than using their coffee syrup. Why? We don't know. The music wasn't 100% consistent with the theme. Part of the time it was oldies, and the other part was 80s. For our lunch, we both ordered the same thing-pastrami on rye with potato salad. The reviewers are spot-on about the potato salad, it's quite good. The sandwich was pretty good as well. After eating, we browsed the antique shop on the other side. I found it strange that the restaurant is sandwiched between two of them. Another odd thing is they were selling some clothes and old family photos along with the antiques. I didn't really get why people would want to buy photos of somebody else's family, but oh well. We definitely enjoyed our experience, so we would eat here again if we came back to Phoenix.",
