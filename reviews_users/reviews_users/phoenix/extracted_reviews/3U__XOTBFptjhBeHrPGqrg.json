I walk up to the counter and she gets off of the beer boxes she was sitting on, only then does she greet me.  Ay, kids!  Anyway, I ordered the Chicken pita sandwich with a salad.  I will say that the pita bread was SO GOOD!  The chicken was grilled, just a little dry, but otherwise good.  The vibe is cool and clean.  Im surprised it didn't have more people.

However, the food was outstanding.  Staff is attentive and friendly.  Pizza is excellent--love the crust-- and the gyro dinner with a Greek salad was fabulous.

This family operated restaurant has class and a great Malbec.  Not only did I eat lunch here today...I even came back for dinner.

My mom ordered the gyro pita with a side of the lemon chicken soup. The gyro meat was soft and very flavorful, just a little spicy. The soup was also good. My sister ordered the chicken feta salad, which she liked. I ordered the saganaki salad with chicken. My salad and my sister's salad looked exactly alike, except hers had feta and mine had saganaki cheese. Not exactly sure what saganaki is supposed to be like, this one was warm and chewy, slightly crispy on the outside, kind of like a fried mozzarella stick that's cooled down a bit so it's more chewy than stringy. It's a touch pricey for what you get, but the food is pretty good. Would come back again if ever in the area.",

The first bite was amazing, the chicken was cooked perfectly! Probably the best Pita I have ever had. The side Caesar was also VERY good. The dressing came on the side and the greens and Parmesan cheese were fresh. I just finished lunch and I can not wait to go back! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, the quality and freshness of the food speaks for itself.",

It could be because it's not overwhelming amazing. It's a really nice, decent, place for lunch. The prices aren't crazy, the serving size is great, just enough to cover lunch and not have leftovers or still be hungry. The gyro is cooked nicely, tender and not dry, can be salty but that's to be expected.  The only thing that isn't spectacular is how loud it gets inside. They have an open space with cement flooring so you will have to yell to communicate with the others at your table, and in turn the people next to you will have to yell, etc etc. There's 3 tables outside and when the weather is lovely try and snag them, you'll be able to hear yourself think better outside.",

I got the gyro pita and my husband got a chicken pizza. For an appetizer we split the hummus which was super yummy! The only thing I would say that needs work is the pasta salad because for my taste, it had too much sun dried tomatoes and the pasta needed to be cooked just a bit more. Other than that, if we are ever in the area, we will be sure to stop. My husband and I are all about supporting local restaurants and this one hit the spot!   Also a little tip, you can bring doggies on the patio and they will even give you a water bowl for them. In the heat of Arizona, this is a must!  Especially if you're camping and don't have a place to leave the puppies!",

The dressing is my favorite dressing I have ever had. I'm serious. I like it so much, sometimes I buy a jar of it to use at home for my own salads. Each salad is served with warm, fluffy, delicious pita in which I use half of the dressing on my salad, and use the other half as dip for my pita. I love the mixed lettuce they use, a lot of variety. I like that they put chick peas on the top of the salad, I love the kalamata olives as well. My husband always gets the jalapeno salad, he likes spicy, and is always satisfied. He switches up the protein between gyro meat and steak, tonight he did steak. The indoor is a good size, there is good parking, it's very clean, and the service is always very friendly. I actually usually have a smile on my face when on the phone ordering the takeout, because the guy I usually talk to, makes it a point to use my name after I give it to him.

    "text": "Worst baklava ever.  I've never had any this bad, not even from a mall food court place back when the Fiesta Mall still had Macy's.  The bottom layer was burnt.  The inner layers weren't golden and crispy but white and pasty.  The worst part was that it has NO honey or syrup at all on the inside layers.  None.  It was just layers of dry sheets of pale white dough and chopped nuts.  There was a tiny token drizzle on top that the cashier girl squeezed on it before she boxed it up, and that's it.  I don't think the layers of dough were brushed with butter either.  It's awful, and definitely not worth the $3.50 they're charging for two small triangular pieces.  Costco and AJ's both have superior product, and Costco even manages a shelf-stable baklava that is much more moist, even if not drenched in honey or syrup like some plates (most anything would be moister than this was).  I got the calamari again and the serving size was very small for the $9.50 they're charging (I'm pretty sure it's much smaller than what I got last time).  It could've used a crispier coating, and was slightly too rubbery.  The pita was still quite good.  They really need to get fabric or rubber pads for the metal feet of the chairs in the dining room as the noise against the flooring is awful.  I don't think I'll be back.  That truly bad baklava was so disappointing.",

I had already devoured half of mine before I realized I had forgotten to take a picture for the review. Portions were generous, I had to take some home and here's the best part- they were delicious cold, too! Pricing was moderate- we got 2 pitas, 2 side salads, a beer and a soda for $34.

The menu is Greco-American but not just gyros and fries. The salads are excellent- those with greens are ample and fresh and the pasta salad is incredible. The pasta salad is penne with a tangy dressing, with spring peas, feta and sun dried tomatoes. That combo really works- the peas are sweet to offset the bite of the tangy dressing and salty feta. A restaurant that pulls together a pasta salad with that much care for flavor, you know they do their grilled fare, pitas, sandwiches and pizzas right.   The pita is overflowing with chicken, gyro meat, steak- your choice- tomatoes and zesty red onions and the pita itself is so good, you'll want an extra one to dip into the house made tzatziki sauce.   Prices are not cheap, not gonna lie, but you do get what you pay for- great food, ample portions, in a clean, modern establishment staffed by a local family. It's a great lunch or dinner if you're counting calories because of all the healthy options. I'm a regular.",

    "text": "I literally can not get enough of this place. My team at work eats here for lunch at least once a week. We order catering from them for events. Their food NEVER fails to please. It's a family owned and run gem. You need to give it a try - it is not optional.   Their weekday lunch specials include a chicken or gyro pita with a side or a salad with chicken or gyro meat. First, their pita is homemade and literally to die for.  The chicken is grilled to perfection and tender and juicy and the marinade/seasoning is heavenly!  The gyro meat is also incredible. I always get the Greek side salad because their homemade vinegarette is so good I crave it. But their other sides are spectacular as well.  Their pizzas (the dough is the pita bread dough) are all amazing as well. I haven't ventured any further on the menu because I love what I get so much but I keep promising I will venture further with other selections.  George is the chef and owner and is usually there. He's great. His wife and kids take orders and deliver the food. They are all welcoming and fun.   There is a counter by the drinks where there is usually a selection of \"free\" items to try. Usually pizza bread (slices of homemade crusty bread with tomato sauce, cheese and sausage or pepperoni), bread slices, and homemade baklava. Yesterday there was a spinachy garlicky and cheese \"pie\" that was incredible and I should have asked what it was called. George brought us over some thick potato slices to try. They were roasted with maybe lemon and garlic and were so good!    Bottom line is this is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Fresh, homemade food, made with a lot of love. And you will go back after you come once. I promise.",

However, I definitely give George's a 4 star, based on their tzatiki alone. Hummus seemed to be homemade, but was a bit salty, and no gabonzo flavor, because it was too runny. A thicker hummus with a bit of lemon would be better. I ordered the chicken souvlaki, the chicken was a little dry and cooled, not served hot, but the flavor was good! It came with warmed pita and that awesome tzatiki sauce, and a nicer wedge of feta and lemon slice. Hubby got the jalapeno pita, he liked it. He said it tasted like a cheesesteak...? Okay, whatever, it's my hubby! I'm sure the traditional gyro would of been better! Our service was terrific! Stacy was very attentive and came to our table to ask if everything was good. Nice touch in semi-fast food restaurant. On our way out, she reminded us to try a sample of the baklava. It was tasty, but I've had better! Dang you Chicago, you've set my standards so high!",

    "text": "My family and 2 other families came here for lunch to celebrate the end of school and 4 graduations. I used to work downtown and would have lunch at George's old restaurant quite often. I highly recommended this place to my friends over all of the other close options because the food has always been delicious.  Unfortunately, as soon as we walked in, the owner like glared at my children and I and none of us were greeted or welcomed in anyway.  In the middle of my children politely ordering their food, the woman (owner) behind the register told me that I \"need to control them while they are here.\" I honestly thought she was joking because my kids were just standing there, patiently waiting to order. Instead of responding to her comment, I asked her if she had a children's menu. She responded by saying, \"well, what do THEY WANT?\" in a not so nice, children are a burden kind of way.  After we ordered, the adults and younger children sat down at one table while the older kids requested that they sit ONE table away to have their own little \"cool\" lunch. The owner was nervously watching us the ENTIRE time and made some comment to my friends about \"how the last time they had kids there, they had to clean the bathroom for 2 hours.\"   I guess as long as you've had the experience of terrible children, it's ok to treat all children terribly.   Anyway, she asked that the older kids move closer to the adults because \"actual customers\" were coming in for lunch and had to sit where they were sitting. I guess the $200 we spent there didn't qualify us as \"actual\" customers. We moved them closer in an attempt to enjoy our lunch and in hopes we wouldn't have to hear any more comments from the owner or his wife. They came by our table 3 more times to passive aggressively comment on all of the children so, because of the tension and unwelcome atmosphere, as soon as the kids were done eating, we said they could hang out outside while we finished up (5 minutes tops) as long as they stayed where we could see them through the huge wall of windows.  The kids were excited because it was the last day of school and, because of the restaurant setup (very loud and echoing), maybe they were a little louder than the other tables, but no one seemed to mind and they were NOT misbehaving. They were eating, laughing, and talking. These are great kids, ambassadors for their school, active volunteers, and are very often complimented for their good behavior and manners. We have never, ever had a issue in any of the hundreds of restaurants we have dined in since we had children 12 years ago.  About a minute after they went outside, the owner came over again and asked us to bring them inside because they were \"unsupervised\" (they weren't) and in danger because of the close parking lot (they weren't, they were on the sidewalk the entire time ) and because, \"customers\" were going to be walking into that restaurant and our children's presence, nowhere near the entrance, would somehow obstruct their path. At this point one of the dads had had enough of the blatant discrimination and politely told the owner that he wouldn't have to worry about any of the kids ever again because there is no way any of us would ever be back. As we were packing up, I honestly ended up feeling terrible that I had recommended this place because it was such a terrible, unwelcoming experience. What was supposed to be a happy celebration and acknowledgement of our children's accomplishments turned into a very tense, angry, unnecessary, worst lunch/restaurant experience ever.  Children are clearly not welcome here even though the location is surrounded by schools and families. There are many other much better, much more welcoming, friendly, appreciative and more reasonable restaurants nearby.  As far as the food goes, I don't even remember how it tasted and it doesn't really matter. Even if it did taste good, no one deserves to be treated less than they are, even children...especially children.",

I stopped in the other day for takeout and ordered the goat cheese salad with chicken, an order of spanokopita and some baklava. Three orders of baklava to be exact - and no, I did not eat all of that myself. I think the total came out to something around $35.  While I was waiting for my order, I spoke with a gentleman that worked there about spanokopita and baklava. He told me his secret to keeping the baklava light after I told him I tried to make it before but it's so much work.   The goat cheese salad comes with 2 pieces of fried goat cheese, which is plenty and also half of an hard boiled egg, black olives, onions, tomato, cucumbers and fresh greens. Everything seemed really fresh in my salad and it was enough to share.   Our spanakopita was a nice addition to the meal. It came with 3 pieces and some tzatziki sauce. Definitely very filling. My boyfriend's mom is Greek and makes baklava from time to time. This reminded me of hers and I wish I had ordered more! Just another reason to stop by here the next time I'm in the area :)",

Had the goat cheese salad with grilled salmon and the feta tomato fries and I'm in epicurean heaven right now....the food at George's Kitchen is fresh, fast, and utterly delicious!  The portion sizes are big and filling with enough to make scrumptious lunch left-overs tomorrow.  The staff was very friendly making the atmosphere inside the restaurant pleasant and comfortable. I came in during a shift change and even the evening crew walked in greeting and helping customers from the moment they came thru the doors.  I LOVE George's Kitchen and can honestly say it's going to become a regular, weekly stop for fresh, delicious, healthy Greek food.",

I was super excited for a new Greek style place to open, phoenix is kind of lacking in that department. I'm from the Detroit area so I love my Greek food, there's no shortage of hot, fresh Greek food there. We ordered two chicken pitas. They were really good, the pita bread was delicious but they were very small for the price (10.50 I believe). My husband was still hungry after his. The fries were good as well and so was the Greek pasta salad. All in all it was good but next time I will go to Greektown or blue moon grill. They have larger portions and better prices.",

To make matters worse, she tried to talk to the manager and the cashier ran over there and started to argue with the customer, the manager walked away and allowed this too happen.   I left and could not even order from this place. I hope this customer writes a review",

The grilled gyro meat in Jim's pita was juicy, served in a hot pita with grilled onions and peppers and mozeralla and I dripped tatziki over the top of it and it made for a delicious mix of flavors and textures.   Savlaki salad was crisp, fresh, tons of feta, olives, and fresh veggies. The vinegarette and a lemon squeeze made for a bright zesty flavor overall.   The side of fries with Jim's Pita was huge. Big enough to share w two people. Portions were big all the way around.   Will be back for sure!",

A rip off. $15 for an overly greasy \"veggie\" gyro that is more like a mushroom cheese steak (thanks for telling me it had cheese on it when I ordered it, I would have not gotten it had I known). No authentic greek flavors on it.   Salad was awful. Tastes like italian dressing, nothing like greek dressing.  I truly do not understand the reason for almost five stars. Out of all the greek food I've had, this has been the least favorite. Not healthy by any means. So greasy it soaked through the bag.",

Pizza was very good, not to much crust and not to big. Just right! Calamari was perfectly cooked and served with a small chunk of feta. Which I have to admit I do not think was going to work. But it did! The hummus was very good with the olive oil and a hint of garlic. The gyro was tender and yummy! For those who make yummy sounds while eating good food. This is a must try.

One of the girls that works there was outside smoking and I did not see her wash her hands when returning to work. She was also somewhat sitting on the ground behind the counter on her phone. The staff seemed like they were bored and just leaning on the counter talking. I prefer a more professional staff when paying these prices. The inside was clean and modern with nice views of 16th st.

Everyone RAVED about it, coming back for seconds and thirds. And I can attest, it was delicious. We had the gigantic greek salad, chicken skewers, gyro meat, spanakopita (OMG), rice, and pitas. Usually we have leftovers after a lunch meeting...not so this time. Thanks George (whoever you are)! We'll definitely be ordering from you again SOON.  :)",

You will find a full array of Mediterranean fare; the saganaki is a particular weakness of mine, and for years, I've firmly believed that Jim makes the best Greek dressing on the planet. The meats are perfectly prepared and seasoned, and there are fine vegetarian selections as well. The breads and pizza dough are addictive (bread-baking is part of Jim's pedigree).

The place is cute, but somewhat plain in decoration. For food, I tried the salad with the special greek cheese (not feta, something else I hadn't heard of before) and the George pizza with sun dried tomatoes, chicken, garlic, and various other toppings. The salad was very tasty, I enjoyed the creamy dressing and felt that the veggies were fresh. The cheese was tasty and the portion was large. The pizza was just ok... again, the portion was generous, but the flavor was nothing terribly special. I would like to come back to try the chicken pita in the future.",

Jim is masterful in the kitchen and cares about his product, always using quality ingredients and a strictly hand made policy. To top it off they have a great selection of beer and wine! A True family owned business that takes care of their customers. We need more places like George's in the valley.",
