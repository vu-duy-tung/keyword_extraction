Got a couple beers and the brussel sprout nachos to share. I got the $5 beer and taco deal for checking in. I ordered the plantain taco. Overall, good experience, since we didn't order any entrees, I we would just caveat that. They did forget the extra fried egg we ordered for the brussel sprout nachos, which they brought out on a small plate after reminding them. The flies were a bit annoying, we kept having to shoo them away from our food.",

A friend and I were very excited to try the food here, when we first arrived we asked the bartender what she recommended, when she recommended the Brussel sprout nachos it didn't sound appetizing so we got something else.  Almost an hour later we asked to get a margarita and the bar tender told us she could not serve us, we asked why she got very defensive and got the manager. The manager, who's name was Cory told us he could not serve us because \"we had the hiccups earlier.\" We were completely sober and were treated absolutely terribly. Worst costumer service I have ever experienced, will never go here again.",

    "text": "Came here for Cinco de Mayo during happy hour (3-6pm). I was able to use the yelp check-in offer for a taco and beer for $5 which is an amazing deal. Tacos are normally around $4-5. Each table comes with 6 types of sauces to add to your meals. Don't forget to try them out!  Service: The waitress was quick and thorough with taking and entering our order. However, the waitress kept forgetting things we requested such as extra napkins and cups of water. The person who brought our order out had no idea what he was carrying had to go back and forth 3 times before he got it correct.  Food: Braised Pineapple Pork was good. Pork was a little dry, but for $5 (combo with beer) definitely worth it. I wish it would've come with 2 tortillas so that i could split it in two. I also got the Sonoran Hot Dog. I enjoyed its Brioche bun the most. So SOFT! I forgot that it was supposed to have bacon until towards the very end of my dog... The beans might have overpowered a lot of the different ingredients including the bacon. I would ask for less beans.   Come here during happy hour and don't forget to check-in to use the yelp promo! Don't expect the best service during its peak time.",

There is a nice fireplace outdoors with seating around it as well.  It was a little chilly when we were here, but they had heat lamps available.  They did offer to move them closer to us, but someone had already beat us to the request.    My friend brought me to Diego Pops for tacos, but we started with the fabuloso brussel sprout nachos.  I was so mesmerized that I forgot to snap a quick photo! I appreciated that the menu indicated the customer favorites, as well as the award winning items.  I had endulged so much of the nachos that I ordered just one taco, the chili verde chicken.  I was quite pleased with my order.  The blend of flavors was exciting and I would absolutely go back for more.  They do have an array of fun mixed drinks.  We ordered something that came in a large coconut.  I would say it wasn't worth the $13, however.  (There is a full bar available.)    I would put Diego Pops on your 'to do' list.",

The hostess seemed leas interested in her job (eye rolling) and  sort of just waved us off.  The server  was not attentive at all, our food came and we asked for the special sauces. Instead of a quick reach for the sauces she decided to take the order of a large party of 6-7 people who had just been seated. While we waited and waited. The place was not packed, I've been to busier restaurants with better service.  We were missing silverware and my daughter got tired of waiting and grabbed  one from another table. The server however was VERY quick to give us our check and  came back quicker than she served us to collect  the payment!  This place has potential to remain in business for a long time if the hiring folk were more selective of their front line workers. The cooks in the back seemed friendlier than the servers!  I would have rather tipped the cooks than our server.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this review is based on customer service and not the food. I've been to Diego Pops several times. The food is consistently good, service is pretty good, and the atmosphere is upbeat. I went there for happy hour, around 4pm, with my boyfriend today and we noticed when we got our check, the prices on the receipt did not correspond with what they were on menu. Our server apologized, kind of acted like she didn't know how to address it and grabbed the manger on duty. She brought back the check and it was still incorrect so the manager came over to our table to talk about it.   This guy came over to our table wearing a pink Diego pops shirt and black shorts, and asked if he could clear our plates. Then he asked if we were waiting to speak with a manager and I said that we were and he stood there and said, \"ok...\". I asked him if he was a manager, he said he was. Although, he presented himself to be the person who busses a table. I told him the issue and I also asked why the add ons for the appetizers weren't part of happy hour since they were part of the appetizers. He said they just weren't and didn't provide an explanation. He didn't strike me as someone who would be a manager because he had a \"too busy to care attitude,\" he didn't introduce himself, say hello, ask us how everything else was, offer us more water or anything, and his appearance certainly did not separate himself as authority. Managers are supposed to be problem solvers and go above and beyond for guest to make their experience a great one.  I am very disappointed and shocked with how the issue was handled, even if my check was adjusted. I hope with better training for their servers, managers, and fixing the prices on the menu it will improve because I enjoy eating here.",

Food has always been pretty stellar, not mind blowing but pretty flippin awesome! Think your usual small joint taco fare with a few additions that take it over the top... think fresh poke bowls and honestly no visit is really complete without an order of their in my own opinion famous Brussels sprout nachos; yes I just said what you think I did, and seriously I get what is going through your mind but somehow they make brussels sprouts and nachos work. No joke, these are not your mothers Brussels sprouts doused in nasty cheese. Just try them and you can send me a thank you card later.   So go.... go on Margarita Mondays, Taco Tuesday, Wasted Wednesday, Tequila Thursdays you get my drift, any night is a good night for Diego Pops!",

    "text": "Great spot for outdoor dining! The design is very playful and colorful both indoors and out, but they nailed it on the patio.   This is a perfect spot to take that person that says \"but I don't like spicy\" when you suggest Mexican food. It's also a fresh, healthier menu than traditional places offer. Their dishes (especially the bowls) can sometimes err if the bland side, but they do give you a basket of sauces you can add to your taste, and their salsa is delicious. You can order their tacos in a bowl over rice or quinoa, but most would agree that it's overly filling in that format, especially because the fun part is sharing smaller plates here!  All the apps are delicious, and they have a great selection of specialty margaritas as well as some simpler, classic ones.   I knocked off a star for service, because it's pretty hit or miss. Their have been times that I've chosen elsewhere because I didn't want to deal with a snotty waitress based on past experiences, and then times when I've been pleasantly surprised. But I'll say there is enough other stuff to like about this place to give it a shot!",

We thought it was a bit of a lazy excuse. The guacamole has little flavor and the quesadillas were completely plain with no dipping sauce. We didn't realize there are canisters of salsa you can get until half way through our meal and had to ask for a set of them. Won't be going back.",

It has a great tequila selection and a decor of bright colors and shiek 70s-ish style that will pop better and better as your eyes and brain adjust to the effects of their delicious drinks and shots of tequila.    Make sure to dig into their unique appetizers to help you \"wash\" down your delicious custom drinks.  To accompany your third drink go ahead and indulge in a couple of their unique custom high brow tacos.  Plus the delicious food will help cut the alcohol so the fantastic decor does not get too blurry.    Stop in for happy hour and get your night started right.",

We ordered the brussels sprout nachos and chicken enchiladas to start and then I ordered the fish taco bowl with quinoa. The bowl is big and after the apps and few margaritas, I could barely make a dent in the bowl. I think the classic taco is the better way to go unless you're starving.  Food and drinks were great, price was right, and loved the outdoor ambiance. Will definitely come back on my next trip to AZ!",

The first time was in October and we sat out on the patio (since the weather was great in AZ, haha) and watched some baseball on the TVs. It was busy, although not too busy. We both had tacos, and let me tell you they were DELICIOUS! The second time was on Cinco de Mayo and it was PACKED! The tacos were still the best part. It was so crowded that we were placed in a tight spot around other large parties. We could barely hear each other and the pitcher margarita LITERALLY tasted like lemonade!!!! WHAT! When a pitcher is about $20 and it is Cinco de Mayo...please actually put some tequila in there. Disappointed about the margs and is why I didn't give a full 5 stars. We will definitely go back though :)",

Service was fast, brief but friendly and our iced teas were kept full. All three of my husband's tacos were delicious. It was fun trying all of the sauces/salsa options that they brought to the table, each one was better than the next. I especially enjoyed the garlic beet crema sauce which went great on the cod taco. The standout was the braised green chili chicken that I added to my salad. It was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor, when I return I will definitely order this again.",

    "text": "To begin with Diego Pops is my favorite restaurant to go eat at and hangout in Scottsdale, Arizona. They have an amazing patio outside to sit and enjoy your food and cocktails and if your not in the mood they have a very nice modern restaurant inside to sit at with a bar that serves many beers on draft and some signature made margaritas. But they have amazing decor there and some good vibes, you walk in they have music playing and its overall nice and relaxing. It's a nice place to show up for happy hour with your friends and hang out with friends or even have a family get together. Diego Pops is an amazing place to start, end or have a nice dinner out in Scottsdale.   Now the reason why Diego Pops is one of my favorites restaurant because of the food they have the best tacos in town hands down! Too start out they have phenomenal appetizers. When I went there I got the Brussels Sprout nachos, which were to die for. It came out with a sunny side egg on top which I've ever had before on nachos, also it came with chicken on it, cheese and some homemade sauces they have. And it's a perfect size to share with 3-4 people. Then after the appetizer it only gets better because they have the best tacos there! They have a wide selection of tacos like, steak, green chili chicken, cod, shrimp and more. But when I went I got the Beef machaca taco with a crispy taco and it was so delicious it watered in my mouth. Then I got another taco, which was the cod taco on a soft corn tortilla, and normally I don't eat fish but the way it was prepared with lettuce onions and there special sauce it was so good. Now if you're not in the mood for tacos, they also have burritos, salads and some poke bowls! After our specular meal we ordered a dessert, which was the churro sundae! It came out with vanilla on top with dulce and de leche with churros under it. To me I loved it because I'm sweet person but on the other hand my girlfriend wasn't the biggest fan.   After our visit our bill wasn't bad at all, we ordered a lot of food and drinks and it wasn't that much. But it also isn't cheap; it would be more in the middle for cost. But its all quality food for sure. Also they have a happy hour 3-6 pm Monday-Friday which has super good deals so take advantage of that. You can get there house margaritas for half off which is like 4 dollars. And when its not happy hour the tacos are a good price, for 2 BBQ chicken tacos its 10 dollars, for 2 chicken tacos its 9 dollars and for the steak its 11 bucks so all the tacos are priced fairly the same. Then there bar has drinks going from 8-15 bucks just depends on there signature margs you order or even a Mexican mule. There beer is also priced nice, 5 bucks for a pint and they have many to choose from. Overall I would say Diego Pops is very affordable for some good food.   What even made my experience at Diego Pops better was the service. When we first got there it only took us a couple minutes to get seated even when they were a little busy. Then we had our waiter approach us and help us go over the menu and told us all about the deals going on. The wait for food wasn't bad at all, it was in and out very quick and prepared nicely. The reason why I come back as well is because the service is always on point, fast and friendly!   Overall I would give this place a 4 out of 5 stars! I would recommend to anyone out there, Its to delicious and everyone should go try. But order wisely when you go and you shall have the time of your life at Diego Pops and definitely leave with a full stomach.",

It was so good in fact that I took my friend there today for lunch.  My husband was jealous so I took him for dinner!  That's how much we loved this place!  We will be coming back--just for their awesome food!",

The bartender had attitude written all over her face the moment we walked in and was absolutely rude. She took both mine and my husband's I.D. and told me my Georgia I.D. was weird but eventually gave it back. She took my husband's international driver's license and went through this book and comes back and says it's not a valid I.D. He gives her another form of I.D. and she says that's not valid either, he needs a passport. Not everyone is from Arizona genius. Like no he's not walking around with his passport on the off chance that he might stop in a crappy place like this one with terrible service. Not once in the seven months that he's been here has anyone treated him like this just to order a drink. He carries his driver's license like all the other people because it's accepted at all the other places. To make the situation even worse, the guy sitting at the bar enjoying his drink tells us she didn't check his I.D.",

Be sure to ask to be seated at one of Steve Sparks' tables and order whatever he suggests that evening, he won't steer you wrong! Having grown up in the Valley and eating a lot of Mexican food, he said he felt like their tacos were some of the best in the Valley, and he wasn't wrong!  We tried the pineapple pork bowl with creamy beans and coconut rice. Brought half home and will definitely be looking forward to leftovers!  Also tried the green chile chicken taco in crispy corn tortilla, grilled steak in flour tortilla, grilled shrimp in crispy corn, and chicken adobo in crispy corn also! All were awesome-especially the grilled shrimp! I've tried grilled shrimp tacos from New England to San Diego and Portland to Miami, but have never had any with the flavors this had.   They have a nice selection of domestic and import beer along with a variety of tequilas and cocktails. The mix a mean Michelada that is spicy but refreshing at the same time.   Already looking forward to our next visit! Brussels sprouts nachos are first on the list!",

The restaurant itself has a very fun and trendy vibe - I loved the neon lights, florescent pineapple wallpaper and creative touches such as a drink menu clipped to an old Baja California license plate.  The lunch prices overall were very reasonable and I liked the option of having a taco entree turned into a bowl with rice and beans, which is what I opted for. The table came with 6 different sauces including a creative roasted garlic beet crema to amp of the flavor of your meal however you choose. The guac we ordered as an appetizer fell a little flat for me - the portion was rather small and I thought there could have been a bit more seasoning.  If I was in the mood for a cocktail, I would have ordered one of the delicious looking snow cone margaritas.  Overall a great casual yet trendy option in Old Town Scottsdale with indoor and patio seating available.",

Yes- because the vibe is too cool to pass up. But next time I'm definitely just getting a drink and sharing some nachos.",

I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by Rebecca who ended up being the bartender. She was friendly and gave some good food recommendations. I ended up ordering the Coconut Lemongrass Ceviche and Mango Habanero Wings. The ceviche was a bit different from the traditional ceviche I have tried but it was good to try something different. I still liked it for the taste and fresh flavor. The mango habanero wings were spicy and it was a lot better with the habanero sauce that came on the side.   There was also a Yelp check in special where you can order a beer and a taco for $5! You definitely can't beat that! The braised pineapple pork taco was very delicious and you must try it!  I would definitely come back here to try the other foods. Rebecca was awesome and the food was great!",

Perfect place to sit at the bar and grab a drink or have a cute outing with some friends. Coming from San Diego where some of the best tacos reside, I was not expecting much since it was not your typical street taco joint. However I was pleasantly surprised! The tacos were delicious and flavorful. There are about 6 unique sauces they have to top your meal with, the beet crema was my personal favorite. The Brussels sprout nachos are a MUST. So delicious and cheesy, and considerably healthier than your typical loaded nachos. Margaritas were on point, not overly sweet. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "{ Dessert Review Only } We originally wanted to come for drinks but got sidetracked by another place down the street. Out of what we ordered I preferred the churro sundae (churro fries, vanilla soft serve, and dulce de leche) over the Mexican coffee (coconut soft serve, cold brew coffee, shaved Mexican chocolate, and dulce de leche). The soft serve itself isn't as creamy and more icy than most. Diego Pops has cute decor of pineapple wallpaper and sayings along the walls. For example Que Pasa on the door to the kitchen and Hola Bonita in the ladies room. I'm on a mission to come back and try the drink in the coconut.",

Our server recommended the Brussels sprout nachos which they did not disappoint AND were half off (happy hour special). The manager came and checked on us and he was very friendly as well :)  We had our server Taylor surprise us with tacos and she brought out the pineapple pork, green chili chicken, and shrimp .... ALL were amazing. I recommend stopping by if you're in town! Great atmosphere and friendly staff!",

    "text": "My colleague and I wanted to get out of the office for lunch. She was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided on Diego Pops. It was a short walk from the office and had amazing reviews.   Before I go into my atrocious experience at DP I will give you a little background on myself. I've competed professionally in the IFBB for 9 years, and if you're familiar with the lifestyle, you know that in order to partake in social events you must be willing to pack your meals and bring them with you wherever you go. This was one of those days that I had to bring my meal with me.   Our waitress was extremely kind, and took my friends lunch order. As soon as my friend got her food I took out my Tupperware and began to eat with her. 5 minutes into our meal, the waitress approached our table and told me I could not have outside food. I politely told her I had food allergies and would gladly take my food outside. She said she didn't want me to have to do that, but, she did want to let me know that if her manager were to see me she would be extremely upset. After the waitress left our table I didn't think anything of it and continued on with my lunch.   The next thing I know I was blind sided by Rebecca (the upset manager) who started off the conversation by saying \"What do you think you're doing?\" She then continued to berate me in front of the entire restaurant. My eyes were wide with shock and my friend had her jaw to the floor because of the way I was being spoken to.   When she finally stopped talking to me as though I was her red headed stepchild, I told her I completely understood the policy of no outside food allowed, but, what I did not understand was why she was speaking to me so disrespectfully. She said I was the one who was disrespectful, and that I had made her waitress cry. Again, I was in shock because at no point during my conversation with the waitress did I feel like I said something that would warrant making her cry.   Regardless, I apologized to Rebecca for anything I may have said that would have made the waitress cry, however, she still did not have the right to speak to me that way. Rebecca continued to argue with me and at that point I just wanted to go. I asked her for her business card, which she said she would gladly provide and she left the table.   When she came back she provided me with her Managers card and verbatim said \"This is my managers card. He will have my back because guess what? The customer isn't always right!\"   My friend had had enough, and wanted to try to make Rebecca understand that what she was doing was not okay. However, Rebecca was just not willing to reason, and started to argue with her as well. My friend then asked for her bill. When Rebecca walked away to ring her up, my friend approached the waitress to apologize, to which the waitress responded, \"I am so sorry. I'm embarrassed at how my manager spoke to you guys.\"  When Rebecca came back to our table to drop off the check, she slammed it down in front of my friend and walked away, but, not before giving her the dirtiest look possible.   I'm not sure if anyone else has visited DP and has dealt with Rebecca's horrendous customer service skills, but, this is by far the worst I've ever experienced.   I have been calling the number on the managers business card Rebecca provided me, and have had no success in reaching him. I'm asking for help, whether it be from a patron or employee, in trying to reach her manager and report this situation so that no one else will ever have to be treated this way.",

The service was flaky at best as we waited at our table to be acknowledged by our server which seemed an extraordinary amount of time since it wasn't that busy. Just a few things that didn't give us the warm and fuzzies: having to ask for water for the table a few times with only one guest out of three getting a glass the rest were forgotten? Or ignored? Having our food come without napkins or cutlery? Just basic things like that. So we got up and started looking around for cutlery so we could start eating. Basically the vibe being given off was that we were an imposition to the place. The food was okay at best. I was hoping with 6 sauces up for offer it would be a flavour explosion. This was not the case. The tacos I had, beef, pork and one fish all tasted stodgy and lacked bright flavours. I couldn't tell the beef one from the pork apart based on flavour. Sincerely I was hoping this place would POP since I chose to take our in-laws here for dinner. I hope they at least improve the service as I don't see this place lasting long with all the competition in the taco market.",

The food is absolutely to die for; with all of the crazy concoctions they produce. I don't think there is one food item I have tried on their menu that did not satisfy.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is so amazing. As you walk in, there is a light up board that changes every so often. Throughout the restaurant there are various pieces of art, colorful walls, and neon signs. Music taste is AMAZING! We asked the server for the playlist, and haven't stopped listening to it since!   Prices are reasonable, for a dine-in restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. Would highly recommend to friends and family.",

My friends looked at me strangely as I rejoiced over this combo, but honestly, I have no idea what they were so weirded out by - how is street corn queso/pickled onion/garlic beet/runny fried egg/brussels sprouts not a more frequent combo around because it definitely should be. To top off the flavor combination perfect, um it was $5 during HH. Is that not a dream!? All the friends that looked at me strangely admit that it was way better than they expected.  + $4 HH margs and not a single complaint.   Since I essentially ate all the nachos myself, I only got a beef machaca taco + Especial beer ($5 if you check in on yelp!). The taco wasn't tasty, but paled in comparison to the above nachos. My friends that tried the beef machaca said they liked the crispy cod more.  Ambiance and music enjoyable (I loved the couches!) I definitely want to come back and eventually try EVERYTHING on the HH menu!  **TIP: Bring cash for valet",

    "text": "What happened Diegos?  I used to love this place when it first opened up. The brussel sprout nachos, tacos, drinks-- everything was spot on. Over the last few months this place has just gone downhill. Everytime I come in it seems like the food gets worse.  In my most recent experience, my friends and I met for happy hour here. The margaritas were good, no problems there. Service was okay. Food was not good. The consensus at the entire table (8 or 9 people) was that the food was expensive for what it was, greasy, and unsatisfying. Diegos used to have an edgy menu and great food! I got two tacos $3.50-$4 each and they were so boring, tasteless, and left me still very hungry. Second dinner, anyone? The crispy taco shell was just so greasy and barely had any chicken. When your entire table orders different menu items and everyone has the same opinion, you know something is wrong!  I would really hesitate to come back here. I think they need to take a look at their quality and make some adjustments or refresh the menu in some way. With all the amazing taco places & happy hour places in Old Town I would put Diegos at the bottom of my list.",

    "text": "This review is for their Taco Monday. You heard me not Taco Tuesday; it's Taco Monday, where all of their tacos are $3 each. Normally Diego Pops's tacos are $3.50 to $5.50. Even though I was super excited for tacos, I had to get their famous Brussels Sprout Nachos and Mango Habanero Wings.  I really enjoyed the addition of the brussel sprouts to the nachos but they seems like an afterthought, just added to make different from regular nachos. Still, the combination of the queso, fried egg, corn, pickled onions, and garlic beet crema was delicious. The wings were also a tasty appetizer with medium heat level. Now onto the main attraction, the tacos.  I ordered the Grilled Adobo Chicken, Braised Pineapple Pork, Charred Skirt Steak, Grilled Salmon, Crispy Cod all on flour tortilla. At Diego Pops you have a choice of flour or corn tortilla for all tacos or what is recommended. It was the general concensus at our table at the chicken was too dry and the salmon too fishy. The favorites were the cod, steak, and pork in that order.   Service was slow, with us asking the waiters multiple times for the same item. But everyone was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely come back again for Taco Monday.  What I recommend: -- Brussels Sprout Nachos -- Crispy Cod taco -- Charred Skirt Steak taco -- Braised Pineapple Pork taco",

The bartender with curly hair greeted us with a not so friendly hello. My husband and I laughed at the rudeness at first but picked drinks and ordered when she gave us some attention. She slowly made my husbands drink, disappeared, helped others and chit chatted. I asked another bartender for a drink. She mentioned something to the rude bartender and then came back with an extremely rude \"she's making it and had to go in the back for you drink\". Gez is everyone rude here! Our table was ready we contemplated just leaving but really wanted tacos. The waitress came by she was very nice so we felt better. We ordered all nine of the tacos and the waitress seemed knowledgeable.  I ordered a glass of wine and it came with only a 2 oz pour. I flagged down someone and she corrected it. I watch as the lazy rude bartenders had to open another  bottle. Obviously it was too hard for the bartenders to open another bottle in the first place to accommodate the customer.  As we waited for our tacos, the people behind us had an issue. One of the rude bartenders came up to the table and pretty much scolded the customer loudly. She looked shocked and I was happy it was not just me. We got our food ate our tacos, didn't want to order another drink and got out of there. The food was ok. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! RUDE BARTENDERS!  WE WILL NEVER GO BACK AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TREATED POORLY. I",

Tried to save it a little with the sauce tray and even added salsa to it and still wasn't there. My Sonoran dog looked like it was from the previous day... typical dry wrinkled no snap day-old dog, the brioche bun was soggy from too much butter. And the tacos were cold. We Couldn't even finish the meal. The salsa was the only highlight of the lunch. Also watched a server shatter a glass over the ice well and proceed to use the ice that the glass had broken into to serve a customer. I will NEVER return.",

There was an indoor/outdoor bar, and as soon as we walked into the front door, the vibe was very unique and we didn't want to leave. We sat at the bar and had some of the BEST margaritas and chips, salsa, and guacamole. They also have a tray of unbelievable homemade sauces to satisfy every tastebud. A must go to!  P.S.

    "text": "I was torn between and three and a four here. There is a lot of possibility to be a five and the ideas and execution are so close. They've been around for a bit and most of my inner circle come here every now and then. This was my first visit and prob not my last. I can say with a little focus on the small details in sure people would come back more often.  Positives: They have one of the best menus for a Latin inspired menu, both drink and food. There are abundant options for vegetarians and the omnivores.   Mexican Mule: perfectly balanced and jam packed with flavor. Watermelon Mint Marg: I thought the lime was a bit strong but a very refreshing summer cocktail. ***Brussels Sprout Nachos: this is such a winning dish.  Everything about this dish is gold. It needed a tad bit of self seasoning as only the chips had salt, but once we set it up we were all about it. Must Try!*** Sonoran Hot Dog: the brioche bun makes this dish.  I could passed on the bacon as always because I can really stand bacon. But the hot dog was perfectly cooked and had such good flavor with the cheese and beans and everything!  Negatives: Watermelon lime sno-cone: a couple steps annoyed me about this guy. They advertise it on their marquee. It actually drew me in and got me so fired up. It was the first thing I ordered when I sat down. It took a bit of time to make it because they hadn't shaved any ice, prob because they were slow and didn't want to have it melt yada yada. Then once it came it was kinda lame. Hard to drink/eat and stained my face red lol. I also hated he paper straw as it would get clogged with watermelon. It's cute but needs more fine tuning for execution.  Ambiance: many old town restaurants bank on location for success and let their eyes drop from the details. Tvs off while being open, tile floors that haven't been power washed in way too long. The floors are not originally black. And walls that are originally white just covered in scuffs and wear and tear. Look at website pics it's beautiful. If they put a tad bit of cleaning into the patio details this place will remain a gem.",

It was busy but not packed and every single table around us remained dirty the entirety of our stay. Occasionally someone would come over and grab a couple things but food remained on 3 tables and un wiped our whole stay which is just odd for a place charging $10-$14 for a margarita. There were several times we didn't see our server for 15 minutes. It was one of those experiences where you want to order more but end up having to leave because it doesn't seem like anyone is around to actually help you get anything you want to have. She walked by a few times but didn't even look at us and when she did it was a look of like oh yeah you're still here it was terrible. The food tastes good but if it's a hassle that I'm there I don't have to be.",

Highly recommend the Sweet Corn and Avacado Ceaser Salad w/ steak + the Watermelon Mint Margarita. Without question, you need the guac, too, because guac is life. Can't wait to go back one day!",

    "text": "Finally made it to Diego Pops after I bookmarked it foreverrrr ago! The pictures others were posting is what really drew me in so I was stoked to try it for myself! My husband and I met up with some old friends we hadn't seen in a while on a Saturday mid afternoon and the restaurant wasn't too busy. We were greeted quickly upon sitting down and we had a house margarita in front of us in no time! The margaritas were solid! Fresh ingredients and you could tell there wasn't any cheap sour mix in there.   What we ate:  - guacamole: it was okay tasting, nothing special. There were plantain chips and tortilla chips which was cool. Needed some more lime juice and salt in my opinion.  - crispy cod taco on flour tortilla (our favorite!) we added some of the green sauce that was on the table and it gave the taco a little boost of flavor that it needed  - pineapple pork in a crispy shell: I thought the flavor of the meat was great but the problem was there was so little of it and I just kept getting a mouthful of thick, crunchy shell. I regret not getting this on a flour tortilla, it could have been great.  - steak: very average, nothing special. Not enough meat.  All of the tacos were lacking in the amount of meat and just loaded up with toppings as fillers. Kind of a let down :(   Service was so so, started great and ended very poorly. Our waitress was very attentive for our entire meal and we were never without a drink but then the restaurant started to get busier. We all got the feeling of being rushed out so there could be a turnover on that table. Not a nice feeling when you are enjoying time catching up with old friends. I don't understand why servers will say \"I'm going to leave your check here but no rush\" and they're literally rushing to get you out of there. We were annoyed when she would not stop asking us if she could take little things off the table including our waters we were still drinking. This really put a bad taste in our mouths and wasn't a good way to end the experience.",

    "text": "From the outside this place is absolutely adorable. I enjoyed the open concept design that transitions seamlessly from indoors to outdoors. The style and decor of the restaurant was very attractive. The service however was the biggest disappointment. We placed our names on the waitlist for a 45 minute wait. We decided to burn time by ordering drinks at the outdoor bar until we received a text that our table was ready. What really bothered us was that we firsthand witnessed the delayed table service. There was about 20 seats that were available to seat people if the tables would have been cleaned. We spotted a table for four outdoors that took about 30 minutes to be cleared. We asked a passing waitress if those seats were included in the bar seating layout and she said no. What was very upsetting is that the entire time we were waiting for a table, dirty tables were left as is. After waiting the entire 45 minutes they sat us at the exact table we asked if we could sit at. I'm not sure where the root of the inefficiency of this restaurant lies or if it's the incompetency of the workers or just short handed staff. However, the food was actually tasty we ordered the guacamole with chips, an assortment of tacos, a salad and a burrito. The food was actually very good. My friend also ordered a drink that took 30 minutes to arrive and once we notified the waitress she said they forgot... this place was a big disappointment overall. Service is so important and the inefficiency of this restaurant was so poor that I think their management would be ashamed to see this all unfold. I really do hope that this restaurant finds out where the inefficiencies originate to run an overall better business.",

I've been looking for the perfect place to bring visitors from out of town who want Mexican inspired food - but that also has a cool ambience, excellent service, and great, unique food. Is that too much to ask for here in our urban desert? For the longest I thought so - now I think I've finally found my spot!  1st: Ambience.  From the outside it looks cool but driving past I always thought it was a small bar. It is a much larger space than it appears from the street and has SUCH a cool vibe inside. The pineapple wallpaper, Frida mural, light fixtures, and fun outdoor patio seating completely had me oooh-ing and awww-ing. A+ for decor and ambience!  2nd: Food.  Sooo many options and all the staples. Salsa. Guacamole. Street side tacos with unique combinations. Choices of corn and flour, fried and un-fried tortillas. Hot Cheetos sprinkled on Mexican corn - what what?! All the food we tried was perfectly delicious.   3rd: Drinks.  They offer a plethora of drinks and fun craft cocktails. The prickly pear margarita has an awesome bright pink color. My husband loved his white sangria. And my watermelon mojito mock-tail was one of the most refreshing drinks ever! I love when restaurants offer fun non-alcoholic drinks so non-drinkers like myself can enjoy a fun, yummy drink as well.   4th: Price.  We just so happen to come on a Monday and guess what?! Mondays are $3 tacos - score! Everything was reasonably priced.   5th: Service. We had great service. Our waters stayed full and our waiter was attentive.   Super pumped we finally found our go-to Mex flared spot! I've only been once so far but I can't wait to return and try more of their fantastic looking dishes!",

    "text": "The vibe in here is great! Came here with a group of friends for a late dinner before heading out into good town for the night. The decor is so cute, with options for seating indoor or outside.   I ordered two tacos, shrimp and cod. Both were equally delicious! My favorite is the variety of sauces they have in a basket on the table for you to use at your wish. The beet crema not only looks beautiful but tastes delicious too. I also ordered a side of jicama and cucumber for dipping in the sauces, that way I wouldn't get too full off of chips. Both veggies were super fresh.   Our service was great! We were originally told it would be a 45 min wait for our table but we got sat within 10 minutes. Food came out promptly and correctly and our waitress came by multiple times to refill our drinks. Pricing is great. Very reasonable for tacos. Next time I want to try the Brussels sprout nachos!",

Appetizers:  *Chips & Corn Queso* A wonderful spin on my beloved queso. It's been a struggle for this Oklahoman girl to find some great Tex-Mex queso in Arizona, but my taste buds are settling for more authentic Mexican food. This corn queso is amazing! You get some corn, you get some cheese, it's amazing. Try it.  *Chips & Guacamole* A mild guacamole, delicious and they are generous with their portion  *Chips & Salsa*  *Shrimp Ceviche* This refreshing appetizer is served in a coconut! I What makes the ceviche refreshing is the cucumber. Beautiful display and delicious shrimp. The app is served with their house made chips.  Tacos:  *Grilled Shrimp* my favorite thing about these tacos is that Diego Pops keeps it simple. Not too much, but loads of flavor packed into the variety of sauces they serve with the tacos/dishes to give it that extra oomph.   --You can also order the tacos in bowl forms- choose your protein, take out the tortilla, add rice, beans, and slaw.  Drinks:  You can't go wrong with tequila. I usually get the taco + beer for $5 or a margarita with my meal!  Great first, second, or 23rd date spot =)",

The wait was not long at all considering the crowd. The staff quickly and efficiently turned over their tables in an amazing manner and we were seated well earlier than expected.   David was our server and he was amazing. He was so attentive and accommodating. Always checking in on how we were doing but not overly so.   We ordered the chips and salsa (the best salsa in Old Town in my opinion), the Guacamole was so rich and creamy and delicious. We the proceeded on to the tacos, ordering the Machaca, Cod, Shrimp, and green chili chicken. All of them were so good! Exceeding expectations.   I also want to point out that the AGM Lexy constantly checked on us to make sure our experience was top notch and it most certainly was. It's impressive her level of attention to detail and how she seems to move from table to table ensuring that the guests were satisfied and enjoying their experience. It's service and the attention to detail like this that make this establishment a must return in my opinion.   Extremely happy and satisfied with both the food and staff! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",

We dined here this evening and ever since our server, Anthony, left it just hasn't been the same.   We waited awhile to be seated when it was obviously not busy enough to be waiting. We were finally sat, got waters and ordered drinks and appetizers. While sitting at the table, we saw a cockroach on the art on the wall above the table. Our appetizers came and our server neglected to check on us. We waited around 7 minutes and then had to ask another server for silverware. We then ordered our entrees. As the they came up in the kitchen window, I watched the food sit there for 10-15 minutes. Our server finally brought our food but only brought my entree. I finished my food before he got his and all of our food was cold. He received his crunchy tacos only to find that the tacos shells had been changed to taco shells that you buy at the grocery store (and not the premium... like Kroger)(and not like signature Kroger... value Kroger)  LOL.   Our server, Taylor, was very pleasant to talk to but could use a bit more training on timing.   All in all, our experiences have continued to worsen and we will not be coming back.",

My friend ordered her go-to: the Watermelon Margarita. I had a sip and it was delicious and refreshing! I chose the Prickly Pear and so glad I did. The flavor was spot on and the bright pink color was awesome as well. Others ordered the regular margarita and a beer, both of which they were pleased with.    The drinks were great, but the food was excellent! I had the steak and salmon tacos and tried almost every sauce they had. Absolutely delicious! The sauces added variety to the meal and made each bite tasty and unique. The chips and salsa they brought out were crunchy and fresh, respectively.   We live in Denver, but I'm already excited to visit our friends again in Phoenix so I can continue exploring this menu and sip a margarita on the patio!",

I should have ordered the hard shell beef tacos because they were pretty good. It's rather loud too so having conversations can be trying. But I'll come back because they have more to try out.",

Outside patio area is great for enjoying a warm day and feels like summer all year with the nicely hung Edison bulbs and tropical-vibe bar.  Service: 4 of us sat at the bar one afternoon due to lack of outdoor seating and our server was excellent. She was friendly and attentive without being too much which is my favorite.   Food: I turned to trusty Yelp and ordered the brussels sprouts nachos with egg to share. We each ordered a different taco bowl and liked them. I decided on the flank steak taco bowl over brown rice and black beans. It was a decent-sized portion that I was unable to finish after the nachos. It doesn't taste \"authentic\" but that wasn't a surprise really. Topped it off with a margarita and was happy.   Interesting place with unique options that will feel a bit overpriced if you're looking for authentic Mexican food. Nevertheless, still good if you set your expectations appropriately.",

She had made note multiple times that she had the right not to serve her and would not be. After embarrassment and disgust we decided to leave and grab dinner somewhere else. So disappointed in the experience they so rudely provided.",

We got pineapple pork, grilled shrimp, crispy cod, and chicken. Cabbage and pickled onion in the tacos were very fresh and crunch along with a good amount of meat.   Salsa tasted phenomenal with a kick of jalapeno.  Ambience is cool and modern with a touch of retro. It feels cozy and welcome. The waitress was incredibly nice by pointing out highlights and explaining the menu in detail as we were first timers.   We highly recommend this place and would definitely go back.",

You have to order chips and salsa which is a pet peeve I have about these modern Mexican restaurants. The chips are soggy. The quac is turning brown and has mango in it, I don't know why you have to put fruit in quac? The tacos barely have meat in them especially their chicken tacos. The house margarita was sour and the waitress forgot salt on the rim. Something is wrong with their draft system. The beer taste bitter and stale. I must be missing something. People seem to love coming here. Maybe they are better during lunch hours but overall I have not been very impressed each time I've come here.",

He had chatted with a couple other people that were at the bar.  The other people left and I was the only one at the bar.  Then 2 pretty girls sat down and he immediately Trevor asked them what they wanted, food or drink.  I asked if he was going to even ask me and he acted surprised, as if I just appeared.    I asked for a menu and ordered 3 tacos and I asked for ice water, he managed to find the dirtiest glass possible with all kinds of stuff on it.  Let's just say this bartender was the worst.",

The brussels sprouts nachos didn't disappoint and the fried egg on top was a nice touch.  The garlic beet crema and serrano ranch sauces were great additions, but don't overlook the guajillo chile one :)  Despite being full, I ordered the pork/pineapple taco and its one I would order again.  Surprising, because I'm super fussy about how pork is prepared.  My dad ordered the chicken tortilla soup.  Flavor was close to homemade, and I liked the taste, but I'm a white chicken meat purist and seeing some dark meat in the soup was off-putting for me.  Again, that didn't impact the flavor, but I wouldn't order it for myself.  Best time to come here would probably be Monday since they also have their tacos for $2 in addition to the other happy hour specials.  Yum.",

Stopped in for my first time last night.  Wanted to be in and out as I was on a dinner break from work. The place was busy at 845pm but not full.  Stood at the host stand for 5 min and nobody even said a word to me. Finally a spot opened at the bar so I grabbed it.  Took another 5 min for the bartender to greet me and take my drink order. I ordered iced green tea to drink and it was delicious and SO refreshing. I decided to order a few happy hour items to try. I got the braised green chili Quesadilla (Tasted AMMMAAAAZZIIINGG), Chips and Salsa (Both yummy), and the Fish Taco (yummy) . However the food took 40 min to arrive!!!! The server had poor communication, then The server tried to say it was the Quesadilla holding up everything and said they can only cook 3 at a time. Not a good excuse. Another bartender helped me towards the end, she was more helpful and better personality.  Hoping the service is better next time, I will be back to try tacos and that delicious Quesadilla!!   They have Happy Hour all day on Sundays and Monday is Taco Monday.",

Is the Mexican Trail Mix Salad sooo yummy and the Brussel sprout nacho thing is out of this world crazy but ultra delicious- you have to try it!   Parking is convenient! Will be going back soon!",

For a supposed chic Mexican place, they didn't even know what a blood orange margarita was. Pathetic...",

We had to ask for silverware multiple times after receiving food, I asked for no salt on my margaritas and still got them with salt, my friends margaritas were not even filled fully, and the drinks were SO weak. A petite girl should have a mild buzz at minimum after drinking 4 margaritas....it felt like we were wasting our money and so we left to go to a neighboring bar/restaurant. On the positive I thought the place was cute, patio is a decent size,  their HH prices are very reasonable and the salsa was good. My bf said his tacos were ok as well.",

Emily was exceptional pleasant and always made a point to check on our table no matter how she busy she got. My nephew was in the area and stop by for a drink and a quick bite to eat so we pulled up an unattended patio chair to our table. As we were relaxing and enjoying our conversation the hostess interrupted and pretty much scolded us that we are not allow to pull up an extra chair to our table and stormed away mad. We all could not believe what just happen. The hostess turn a pleasant 5 star dining experience to the worst by choosing to be rude, distasteful and ruining our Diego Pops restaurant experience.

From the case of $2 Chocolate Tacos to the canvas of Frida Kalo, the neon sign on the wall that says \"there is no place like Mexico\" and the left green old school refrigerator stocked with glass bottles of refriscos and coca cola.  First off, their happy hour from 3-6 is unbelievable.  All appetizers  are half  off, so you can enjoy  their very famous and delectable Brussels sprout nachos and coconut lemongrass ceviche for half the price. Wash that  down with the Diego margarita for only $4 (lime, triple sec, simple syrup, house tequila) and your tab for two is $21 during happy hour.  Roasted garlic beet cream is to die for. The Habanero oil is a must try and adds subtle heat but buttery delicious flavor.  Lemongrass coconut  ceviche is an incredible summer appetizer. Perfect blend of crunchy fresh shrimp, paired with flavors of coconut and lemongrass, and little bit of heat from Fresno chili.  The street corn queso makes the nachos, and there just isn't anything I don't love here.  Finish the night at the 'Treat Bar', which has ice cream, Churro fries, chocolate ice cream and chocolate tacos.  Love love love!",

    "text": "I used to really like this restaurant and always recommended it to anyone looking for something different than the typical Mexican food. Unfortunately my friends and I had an awful experience the other night because with incredibly rude servers and the bartender, Rebecca. Not only did she act like it was the biggest inconvenience when we asked if we could do separate checks, she didn't check on us once to see if we needed anything nor asked how the drinks or food was. Her attitude and glares were uncomfortable the entire time we waited for our dinner. The food didn't take terribly long to come out after we ordered but when three of us never received our entrees and I asked if they were on their way our, she rudely told us that because we ordered on separate checks the food would come out at different times. The strange thing (and I pointed this out to her) was that the three missing entrees weren't ordered at the same time. Finally after about 20 min two more entrees came our. Everyone was waiting for all the food to arrive so their food was cold and once again, no comments from Rebecca nor the two male serves that the last one was coming. I've worked in many restaurants when I was in college and I've never not apologized for any delay in food coming out nor gave guests death stares because they inquired where some of the entrees were. Not treating people with respect and ignoring their questions is horrible service and uncalled for. After 25 minutes the last entree arrived and after a heated exchange with Rebecca and the two male serves she told us to get out and that she was the owner of Diego Pops. None of us have ever experience such horrible service from a formally good restaurant where we all have been to many times. I'll never go back and since the host says she has no idea how to contact Ryan the actual owner, I'm stuck writing this review instead of addressing the terrible experience with him. It's really a shame because the food is decent, great when it comes out fresh and hot, but I would never give a business who hires managers like her revenue. Worst dining experience we have ever had!",

    "text": "I met S1 & S2 here for lunch. Diego Pops has a very cool vibe. The beautiful patio area on the south side of the restaurant is awesome.  Our host sat us right away with a smile and some pleasantries. The inside is clean with a slight midcentury groove. The exposed bricks on the interior does give the feeling of a retro fitted 80's Taco Bell (A good thing).   S had asked me where I wanted to eat. I checked out Yelp and it seemed that Diego Pops had so many 5 Star reviews I figured it must be amazing. Well, not so much. I was rushing so I didn't really read the reviews, I just scrolled down past the numerous 5 Stars. I should have read more. The issue is there are a lot of reviews that don't say anything about the food. Zip. Just \"great service\" so here's 5 stars. Wow. I guess if someone figures out a way to eat service I could understand it. But can you imagine someone writing a review for a movie and only saying the popcorn was great, the seats were comfortable and then say nothing about the movie but give it the top of the scale rating. Diego Pops is a restaurant. For me, good service is an expectation, not a luxury or \"bonus\" feature. I come for the food and if it's amazingly good and the service matches it, 5 stars for sure. But I've said it before, if the service is bad but the food is awesome, I'll come back and just make sure I get a different server but I certainly wouldn't toss out a 1 star with a lot of whining. In my opinion, it should be about the food.  Off the soapbox. All that being said, our service was great. Our server Taylor was very nice, kept our drinks filled, was not intrusive to our conversation and paced everything correctly. She answered our questions and generally made us feel welcome. She even handled ALL of the special requests S2 had with grace. Nice job Taylor.   We started our meal with an order of the Brussel Sprout Nachos ($10). Now this could possibly be one of the greatest food items of 2015. But, our order was just not done correctly. It's hard to tell how the Brussel sprouts are cooked because so many on our order weren't. Raw or almost raw Brussel sprouts can be a bit hard to chew and enjoy. I think these were supposed to be steamed and then sauteed but most weren't. Personally, I would just roast them but that's just me. The Brussel sprouts sit on a pile of really nice tortilla chips that are covered with street corn queso, queso Oaxaca, Fresno chili's, pickled onions and a roasted garlic beet crema. The whole pile is then topped with a fried egg. Ours was beautiful, perfectly cooked. Cutting into the egg and having it ooze over the nachos was just plain yummy. If the Brussel sprouts would have been cooked properly, this would have been an amazing dish.  S1 ordered the Skirt Steak Bowl ($11.) with coconut white rice and stewed beans. His bowl included the white rice and beans topped with a good portion of grilled skirt steak, house slaw, grilled onion slices and crispy leeks. The guacamole was mysteriously missing. S1 said this was a very tasty bowl. The skirt steak was cooked a bit on the well done side, but all in all a good effort.  S2 ordered a Braised Green chili chicken Taco ($3.50), a Crispy Cod taco ($4.) and a side of Cilantro Lime Rice ($2.) S2 said everything she ordered tasted fine but that it was nothing special. The green chili chicken was nicely spiced and the flavors well integrated. The crispy fish taco was also fine. She felt the fish could have had a bit more crisp to it but overall it was a good effort. She enjoyed the rice without much comment. It seemed to me like her whole meal was a good value.   I ordered the Crispy Cod bowl ($10.00) with brown rice and creamy beans. This was a miss ALL the way through. First and most important, the fish was not crispy. Nor would it ever be because it was sitting on top of the rice and creamy beans and then covered by the house slaw. So, it basically steamed and if there ever was a crispy coating, it was soggy before it reached our table. Why, if the main ingredient is the crispy cod, would you not put it on top to showcase it? This was a serious bush league mistake. The main ingredient should be the focus and standing out in all of its glory. The mistakes continued. There was no guacamole, I got pickled onion instead of grilled onion and there was no crispy leek anywhere. I think it bailed with the guacamole. So for ten bones I basically got what tasted like a tostada with soggy fish, without the tortilla. No Bueno.  We all ordered Iced Teas and at ($3) a piece, they're expensive even for Scottsdale. The tea was great and Taylor brought us all To-go teas to take with us so I guess in the end it's a wash.   I like Diego Pops. However I think the food could use some work if it's going to truly be a 5 Star, heck, even a 4 Star experience. Great service, Great vibe, fair prices, awesome Nachos in theory, average food at best delivered. 3 Stars",

The green chicken Chile was kind of plain but still delicious.  Now on to the -2 Star. The service was one of the worse experiences I've ever had. I totally understand mistakes but I also feel customer service and satisfaction is very important. So first we ran out of chips and we had to ask twice to get more. Our waters weren't refilled until we asked. I ordered 2 tacos, 1 was wrong and the other had a chunk of plastic wrap in it which I bit into. When our server finally came to the table I informed her of the mistakes of my meal and she said well what do you want me to bring you. I just felt like the waitress should have taken initiative to fix my meal. Instead I ordered just one more taco to replace the wrong one. I was still charged for 2 tacos.",

If you check into yelp, you get a taco and huge glass of beer for five dollars. Basically, you get a free beer because one taco is around $4.50- $5.00.  I ordered a taco and we shared the artichoke nachos. The taco was good and I loved their selection of sauces. Some of my favorite sauces were the pink beet sauce and creamy cilantro sauce.  The artichoke nachos were delicious. They were crunchy and had a lot of cheese melted throughout. It had the delicious pink beet sauce drizzled on top of it.  I loved this place and I'm glad we stopped here to get lunch.",

We sat outside which was nice even in the early evening Sept weather. We each had a cucumber margarita, split a corn queso, and got a couple tacos. The margarita was nice and refreshing. I liked my tacos but I got two and only remember that I liked the shrimp. So the other one must have been \"just ok.\"  But the Star was definitely the corn queso. I usually stay away from queso since it isn't the healthiest, but this was so good and wasn't heavy feeling. Plus it had corn in it...so that makes it healthy...right?   Great place to come for a drink and apps, meet up with friends, or bring a date.",

Ugh, I could go on forever about how great it is. The chips and salsa are even amazing, and that's just the start. Try the brussel sprout nachos. I know it sounds strange, but trust me. They're to die for. All of the tacos are great, but my go to is the beef machaca. Try it with the green chili sauce. YUM. I would eat it every day.   Even the drinks are so fun! From a great classic marg, to the guava coconut drink, can't go wrong. (See the pictures for the guava coconut... it comes served in a real coconut and a little umbrella!!)   I wish this place was closer to me because I would actually be here all the time. DEFINITELY try this place.",

FOOD Brussel Sprout Nachos - Nachos w Brussels sprinkled on them. The pink beet cream was pretty good with it. Solid dish but I thought there would be more sprouts.   Grilled Shrimp Taco - Everyone raved about this so we had to try it. It was good but nothing spectacular. The corn salsa was good though. Probably best thing about the taco.   Plantain Taco - This was interesting. It wasn't bad, just different. Interesting flavors because the banana was sweet but then it sits on creamy beans. Not quite sure how I feel about it.   Coconut Rice - I really had high hopes for this but it wasn't that good. Didn't taste much like coconut and it was super mushy.   This spot is more so for the cool vibes and the social aspect. As for the food, I would choose to go somewhere else",

When they finally did it was because I called her over. She was not assigned to our table but took care of us which was nice. We ordered appetizers, tacos, rice and beans. Our appetizer never made it. The tacos were very good which was a saving grace. The refried beans really had no flavor and to be honest looked like they came straight out of the can. The rice was basically white rice again without much flavor. The pork, chicken and shrimp tacos were excellent but the service and other items will likely keep us away from this restaurant.  The manager did come over and apologized but made an excuse about change of shift. Frankly that's not my problem....again they did, comp our dinner but there are so many restaurants around that area that we will try before going back.",

A coworker and I are in town for business and stopped in on a Monday night, and it was surprisingly pretty busy around 6:30pm but we were able to be seated right away.   We started with some guacamole and chips that came out immediately, but it was just slightly bitter and was browning in parts, so they obviously weren't using fresh avocados. I had 1 pineapple pulled pork taco on a corn tortilla and 1 crispy cod taco on a flour tortilla, and both were super flavorful with fresh toppings. The sauce caddy they put on the table really makes the experience though, you get 6 squeeze bottles to choose from with inventive flavors like serrano ranch, chipotle aoli, habanero oil, garlic beet crema, and 2 others. The beet sauce on the cod taco is next level.   We also split the sweet corn and avocado salad with caesar dressing and adobe chicken that was pretty large and one person easily could have had as a filling entree. For 2 ppl our bill was $55 including 2 margaritas, so the food was a fantastic deal, but the service left a bit to be desired. It took awhile to get our server's attention and when I asked another for an extra bowl she looked at me and then walked away. Yikes.",

While staying in Scottsdale I strolled by this location several times and each time it was flooded with people and look like so much fun! After finally getting around to trying it I was able to put myself on the waiting list via Yelp while I was in my Uber on the way over. This saved me a ton of time! I also requested a patio seat as always. When I arrive the servers were very friendly and you could already tell the restaurant was popping, generally with the younger crowd of people 20-30's. When I sat down a girl Next to me had two dogs at their table. They said one of the best things about Diego Pops is that they have a dog friendly patio (bonus points on my end)! After several minutes the girl from the table next to me made some food recommendations and started asking me where I was from. Since she was friendly we began to talk and next thing I know they were scooting my table next to theirs so we could all eat together. I was so humbled by the fact that they were such sweet locals here. She recommended the street corn queso which was absolutely phenomenal! I ate every single bit!! Their house margarita was also incredibly delicious but if you can't handle that much sugar order like I did and get the skinny version it was still very tasty!  For my meal I ordered three street tacos including the shrimp taco, the brussels sprouts taco, and the plantain taco. The shrimp was my favorite but to be fair by the time I made it to the other two I was already full from the street corn queso (love)!! The service was impeccable here and the noise level was what you would expect from a very busy restaurant with two bars and a younger crowd. I love the dining set up with the open patio it made for such a fun meal with some fresh air. If I come back to Scottsdale I will definitely visit again!",

    "text": "First things first - I want to start with poor management skills and customer service.   I called the week before we flew into Scottsdale looking for a Mexican restaurant that was trendy and fun. I have coworkers that live in Scottsdale and (until recently) were recommending us to go there for dinner for a Bachelorette party. The restaurant doesn't take reservations but the person I spoke with on the phone told us to show up 45 minutes early and they wouldn't have a problem accommodating 13. Myself and one other girl from the group decided to show up 45 minute early to put our name on the list and go to a bar next door for a drink while we waited. We gave our name, number of people, and our phone number, we were told a 30-40 minute wait. After 45 minutes went by we missed a phone call and decided to walk back next door and get our reservation - we assumed they were calling to tell us we were ready as we only missed the call by 3 minutes. NOPE.  Once we got there they rudely told us it would be ANOTHER 45 minute wait after we had already waited for 45 minutes. We had canceled our other two reservations for dinner to go to Diego Pops after the phone call we had the previous week. The two girls working at the hostess table had nothing to say besides shrug their shoulders and say it would be another 45 minutes (when it was already 8:15 and we had already waited). Their terrible customer service and stuck up attitude pushed me to sign up for a yelp account and save other people looking for a dinner restaurant in Scottsdale. There are so many other options with great food and atmosphere that I'd recommend you'd go. If you have a fun group of ladies at a Bachelorette try - The Montauck. They saved us on a night they were super busy given our circumstance. Super fun and the manager treated us to complimentary champagne. Bless him.  Good Luck.",

The food and Drinks come out at a reasonably timing also.  Street corn is bland and the bean burritos are small.  The machaca Taco barely had any meat, that was extremely disappointing. There was literally only a bite of meat on a taco, what's the point?  The house Marg was surprisingly delicious and the watermelon lime snow cone was not good, don't bother!  Nothing special about this place but nothing wrong with a taco spot!",

Lunch,l and happy hour are much diff from pre-club hours.  The food is great. I always go for the Street Corn Queso, which is a creamy-chunky white cheese dip w corn for the chips. The tacos are also worthy. I eyeballed the neighbors brussel sprout nachos because they looked fantastic. Next time.  My one star deduction is for the hit or miss service during my many visits. Sometimes the bar is inattentive. Also, my pet peeve is when a bartender does not wipe bar between seatings. Today was not the case. Super bar service and the back was hustling.",

I'd recommend keeping it to a medium-sized group, though. The happy hour was great, and everyone seemed to enjoy the food. I loved my berry mojito and the guava coconut drink! The guacamole with plantain chips and salmon rice bowl were really good. Make sure to check the size of the tacos to pick the right quantity and let them know if you don't want the food spicy.

Great ambiance and adorable decor complete with pineapple wallpaper - the ultimate restaurant for foodie/blogger pics!  The food is even colorful (see Brussels sprout nachos!) BUT unfortunately it didn't quite live up to the visual appeal.   Case in point - We were told the nachos were the best item on the menu and they were super pretty but it honestly was not anything special. Not worth ordering. I was also excited to try the crispy cod taco (definitely crispy but the tiniest piece of fish) and the pineapple pork tacos but they were pretty standard. My friends got the poke and chicken taco bowl and said they were decent.   Fun spot for a group but they don't take reservations and the restaurant isn't too big so be prepared to wait!",

I was feeling veggie that night, so I opted for the bean and cheese burrito which was fantastic, and the other girls mentioned that their tacos were equally as yummy.

I thought  the decor was going to be much cuter than it was but in reality it just a regular restaurant with a couple neon signs, nothing spectacular.    We ordered the watermelon snow cone margarita, mango habanero snow cone margarita, and the mini churros. Both snow cone margaritas were just a standard margarita in a shallow glass with a massive ball of frozen solid ice placed on top so that it resembled a snow cone but was not edible like snow cone ice. The snow cone ice had no flavoring like that of a regular snow cone and the ice ball honestly just took up space in the glass which was small to begin with. At 11 dollars a piece I found the snow cone margarita to be extremely over priced given the small amount you receive and the lack of flavor. The mini churros were also very mediocre, they came out in a paper cup with a chocolate sauce and icing sauce both which were cold making it hard to dip the churros in and the churros got hard shortly after they were brought out.   Our waiter was nice enough but overall I was very disappointed from my visit and will not return in the future.",

There are two snow cone margaritas to choose from: watermelon lime or mango elderflower. Save room for dessert! Along with their cocktails they have a great dessert menu which includes ice cream you can have dipped in fruity pebbles.",

The salad was incredibly fresh (rare to find) and tasty.  Left feeling very satisfied without breaking the bank.  Atmosphere was cool and the service was amazing.

We showed up with my family for dinner, a party of 13 on Saturday at 5:30pm, just ahead of us were also two large parties as well, one of 12 and the other of 9. When it was our turn to be seated, the seating hostess was incredibly rude, unaccommodating and basically told me that they were not the kind a restaurant that could seat large parties!  So I asked if we could split our party and sit in two groups, and the seating hostess aside from being rude was very reluctant to figure out how to get our party seated. The restaurant was as usual very busy at that time, but there were clearly a few open tables! Since she just stood there as she silently stared at me, I asked her if she was basically asking me to leave, and she proceeded to tell me that \"if it were her, she would want to be seated with all her family.\" In other words, the answer was \"yes\"  We have lived in Arizona for thirty years now, and this is sadly the third time I've been treated in such a despicable manner. Perhaps, it was because we didn't fit the profile \"look\" in order to eat at Diego Pops, perhaps it was because I had brought my parents and my 94 year old aunt and cousin who were visiting from out of the country. Either way, this was a terrible experience and it's very unfortunate this restaurant gave off such an  unwelcoming, snobbish and even prejudice vibe (due to race, age, maturity?) The employee working as the seating hostess should NOT be your front of the house person! Although the food was good, I'm not sure it could ever make up for making someone feel so unwelcome and treated so unkindly!",

Last week I was told my dish was made with pasteurized cheese only to find out today that it isn't (or so they say). I hope the chef can educate their staff (and perhaps include details on menu) so that future moms don't have to worry about miscarrying secondary to listeria. Listeria is deadly but also preventable. Future parents have enough to worry about without having to deal with inaccurate information from ill informed waitstaff. Shameful.",

The service was wonderful not too rushed and we probably came at the wrong time but that didn't stop me. I've been hearing about the Nachos, it's not just any nachos it's the Brussels sprout nachos! From the flavor to the cheese and to the ingredients everything is so outstanding in flavor! You see I never had a Brussels sprout but it's kinda like a more flavorful broccoli! I give it 2 thumbs up! They also have different sauces from chipotle mayo to a Serrano ranch! Tacos are outstanding but it's based on one, there's so much more j want to try! Cocktails and the specialty drinks are wonderful and different! Must try the coconut drink it comes in vodka and tequila! So if you are in the Scottsdale area give it a try stop by! By yourself or with you or friends!",

The atmosphere was very relaxed, great bar area & outdoor dining. Margaritas were good & great Mexican beer selection on tap!",

For a Mexican restaurant, I expected the margaritas to be better. It was only $4 though so the speciality ones are probably better. The Brussels sprout nachos were good. The tacos were very boring. The green chile chicken taco did not taste like green chile at all and was very plain. The server never brought us the sauces for the tacos so that is probably why they were so dry/boring. I did not realize until after the meal that every other table had the basket of sauces.   The service was fast and we did not wait long for our food, which was great. The prices were also very good.",

We have done group lunches there and I've also met non-work friends there to introduce them to the amazing food there. The service has always been amazing. The food is even better. I've only had one issue there (accidentally had pineapple on my salad which wasn't supposed to come with pineapple) and it was resolved very quickly. If you are vegetarian I recommend the House Salad and add avocado. The chips and guacamole are a must-have also. They have some unique options of iced tea as well as other drinks. The decor is adorable and the restaurant is always clean including the bathrooms.",

The crunchy green chile chicken taco was tasty - the crunch was perfection. Unfortunately our food wasn't hot and normally we'd send it back if that's the case, but we were quite hungry by the time we visited.   The Plantains are \"Platanos\" (the sweet fried kind to those who aren't familiar). We'd wished they were \"Tostones\" since we prefer the savory, crunchy unripened plantain.  The margaritas were good. I really enjoyed trying each of the 6 sauces they offer to customize your taco. They all were great and some unique (like the Beet Crema - mild yet flavorful - delish!). I'll admit the sauces were probably my favorite part of the experience. If our food was hot, the tacos would have been the star.  Pleasant, friendly staff. We dined at the bar.",

Really disappointed no one brought be the sauce tray, especially since I'm a big condiment person.   Guacamole and salsa was delicious! Too spicy for me, but the best I've had in town.   Three stars because I would definitely come back to hang out with friends and have some snacks, however, I wouldn't come back just for dinner.",

The food is sooo good, they won a ton of awards at the Taco Festival so that's not just my opinion. I always get the street corn queso, it's basically liquid gold. They have a great choice of different tacos and bowls, they just added burritos to the menu too. Their drink menu is fantastic, and they just added pitchers of margaritas and beer (holler). They also have a really cool dessert menu, I tried the churro fries once and they're as good as they sound.  Everyone that works there is really nice and the service is always on point. The bartender with the bow tattoos is so nice (I suck for always forgetting her name) and Taylor is a great server, she's nice and really attentive. Any time I've ever had an issue they've always taken care of it right away! I had a weird reaction to a drink once so they brought me out a different one and comped it for me. Sooo nice of them. Basically, you should just try this place, it's really good and you won't regret it.",

Absent minded servers (all 3 times). Over 45 minutes for our server to take the order. I had to get her at the server station. No exaggeration. Appetizers came in an orderly fashion but we never saw a manager on the floor or touching tables. Basically a cool concept with zero clue about service standards or delivering a guest experience. I figure this starts with lackadaisical leadership at an owner level because the lack of management is apparent here and in their other concepts. That's a shame.",

I wanted more, hell I wanted another burrito it was so good. I would describe Diego Pops as a taco shop if you only described a taco shop menu to Michelin rated chefs. It's elevated but also good.   My meal was $10 and it was worth it. Love the combo of good food, great location and awesome service.",

Our tacos came out about 5 mins after the appetizers but we still had not received our chips and salsa. When we asked the waitress for our check, it took her another 5-6 mins to bring our bill.  Over all, our meal should have taken 20 mins and after all was said and done (ordered, food, drinks, Bill) we were there for 2 hrs!  Good for a lively afternoon but expect to be there a while.",

I must say that the food was delicious, especially the Street Corn Queso (I went back two days after just for this dish). The margaritas are easy to drink and they didn't skimp on the alcohol either. The service was friendly and prompt. The tacos are also decent. But if you're looking for something more fulfilling, the bowls are a good alternative. I recommend checking this place out for happy hour where the appetizers are half off and the margaritas are $5.",

The food is delicious so that obviously calls for a decent rating right there, but the service is absolutely atrocious. I've been there an hour before closing and the bar staff tells me the kitchen is already closed. Upon asking why they respond with \"they kind of just decide to do whatever they feel like\"...uhh you're a business with clearly listed hours, you should be functioning during said hours.  The experience I had yesterday was by far one of the worst. I went there around the end of happy hour hoping to sneak in a last drink before it ended. It took over fifteen minutes of no one saying hello, no water, not even a single acknowledgement from any staff members before I spoke to the incredible manager named Priscilla. She immediately sent over the server by the name of Isaac/Isaiah who was not only beyond rude but one of the absolute worst servers I have experienced EVER. I had seen him during my fifteen minutes of sitting there talking to the staff, texting on his phone, and doing anything but his actual job. When he finally served us he was rude, inattentive, and clearly didn't care at all. He never checked back on food quality. Priscilla basically became our server since Isaac didn't care enough since our bill was being comped anyway. I'm so beyond disappointed with this establishment and wouldn't recommend going there unless you have time to waste and please for the love of everything in this world hope you never get Isaac.",

There must have been 15 people standing at the door to be seated, a half empty restaurant, and no hostesses.  I almost walked over to the 5 employees rolling silverware to ask if there was a host.  Then one slowly wandered over and without any urgency began to sit the crowd of people forming at the front door.    Service was slow.  We sat on the patio.  It took a while to be greeted, and our drinks took awhile to arrive as well.    The tacos were pretty tasty and I love the different sauces that they put on the table.  However the mango habenero wings that they say \"take awhile\" because they are fried, then grilled were definitely not grilled.  I've had amazing twice cooked wings from JTs before and these had just been deep fried and tossed in a slightly sweet and hot sauce.  But they lacked any crispy or charred notes you get from grilling them.  We asked about them to our server, who took them off our bill, but we never saw a manager and they didn't over to remake them right.  We didn't eat them.  My girlfriends House salad was underwhelming.  The dressing was super watery and lacked any flavor.    Overall,  just a lame experience from start to finish.  No real hospitality. No attempt at recovery.  Don't waste your time with this place.  There's way too many better options in Scottsdale.",

All of the tacos are tasty and have a good amount of protein on them. You can dress them up with any of the zesty taco sauces they have at the table. My favorite is the beet crema!",

    "text": "Cool vibes and fusion style tacos. It's a pretty happening place, waited about an hour a table on a Monday night. We ordered a drink at the bar while we waited. I had the prickly pear margarita and although it looks pretty and fun in pics, the flavor was lacking. Seemed like a cheaper tequila and had no pear or even sweet agave flavor to it. Don't get me wrong though, I did finish it. Unfortunately I keep feel that tequila in the pit of my stomach for the rest of my meal. We were sorted. Chips are considered an appetizer and cost $2. Which is typical for a trendier place like this. Chips and salsa were good and worth the $2. Waitress was super sweet and allowed both my husband and I to use the $5 yelp check in deal for a taco and beer!! We had 3 tacos shrimp, plantain, and steak. My son had a chicken burrito. The flavor of all tacos was pretty good. Unique blends of items. And they bring over a caddy of 6 different sauces to pair. The beet cream was on par!  If we are in the area again; I would come back for the vibe, good tacos, reasonable pricing, and something else at the bar.",

I'm literally still sitting here 45 minutes after this started and we are waiting for her to come back. Needless to say this will be the last time I bring friends here. Highly don't recommend this place unless you have the patience of a Buddhist monk.   Update- she just came back and everything is still wrong and we have waited forever for nothing.",

Our waitress Michaela was nice and everything started off good. She recommends the elote off the cob and we were excited to try it. She said everything is the same it's just in a bowl. Well it comes and it is pretty much corn from a can not roasted nothing, it was disgusting. We don't complain we just kniw next time not to order it again. So I order my 2 tacos and wanted to try the coconut rice and pinto beans. My food comes and I can already see my crunchy shells are pretty dark which I over look. Being excited to try the rice I dig in... The rice is cold! Mind you Im at lunch from work so no time to send things back. I push it and the beans to the side cause I'm not eating cold rice and warm beans. I eat my tacos you can taste They are burnt... Still ate them. After I ate I went to go wash my hands. When the waitress comes to the table my friend says the sides are cold. Then the waitress picks up the sides and says rudely the beans are not cold, my friend says ok maybe not the beans but the rice is cold. The waitress then said oh yeah it comes cold...Who serves cold rice?? Ewwww!! My friend said well the rice was cold we weren't advised it's cold(not on the menu) she didn't touch the sides. In my opinion the waitress could of handled it different. She could have said I'm sorry about the rice it is served cold we can remove it from the order. She removed the $2 charge but how she was rude about it was annoying. Again normally it's pretty awesome but this past Sunday was terrible.",

For your typical yelp review, the atmosphere was sublime, the music was on point, and the service was ok. I think I got better service from a blind sales person telling me I look dope in that suit than I did here.   Overall, I still had a great time and they deserve an almost 5 star rating.

    "text": "For starters the food was ok, not great not bad....middle of the road, but a bit pricey for what you got.   The reason I won't go back there though is one of those little reasons that just leaves a bad taste in your mouth about a place.  We were there for lunch, there was probably only 4 other tables of people eating in the whole place.  We ordered a couple beers with lunch, and after about 10-15 minutes the waitress comes back and says, \"sorry the kegs were empty they are just changing them out.\" I reply, \"No big deal...we are not in a rush, thank you\" ...HERE is the issue...she follows it up with \"while you wait do you want some chips and salsa?\" me: \"sure that's fine, thanks!\"  I was charged for the chips and salsa..Now it is only $2 so I don't care about the cost of them at all, and didn't say anything because clearly....it's $2.  However, when something is presented as \"sorry for the delay, would you like this while you wait?\" ... and then get charged for it...it's just a really terrible way to conduct business. It's the principle on how things are done, and that $2 (probably a .20-.30 cent cost to the company) is going to be something that keeps me from going back.  ....oh, and the \"slaw\" was essentially just chopped/thin lettuce.",

Our waitress - maybe she was knew - couldn't answer our menu questions to save her life, had no idea about the sauces, was very inattentive, and couldn't even tell us what type of food DP's actually served!! From being sat, to ordering an app, to finally ordering an entree... was about 25+ minutes, mind you there's no food actually coming to us during that time, not even chips... and she got flustered when some people starting asking  questions. I had even asked another server (b/c ours disappeared) to bring me a tortilla to snack on - NEVER GOT IT!  And word to the wise: if you don't see it on the menu, don't ask for it! They can't do it! Yes, DP's has nachos, which comes with melted cheese, but ask them to melt cheese on your burrito, and it takes 3 people chatting it up for one person to come tell us NO!... yet no one ever asked the kitchen guys! And don't ask them to make a smothered burrito (enchilada style), because they can't do that either. Huh? You have giant bottles of hot sauce... just pour it on top. On top of all that - my diet cokes (all 2 of them b/c our server never asked if we wanted a refill... we had to seek her out) kept coming to me kind of warm, with practically melted/no ice.  All around - bad experience and won't recommend Diego Pop's anytime soon.   ~~~~~~~~ First time here - haven't even finished eating yet - and already know that I will be back!! I'm having a braised pineapple pork taco and a beef machaca taco... both are we're tender and delicious. Also got a side of creamy pinto beans (yes, basically refried beans) - still good - came with some chips on the side. Staff were friendly and made sure I had everything/needed anything else. The owner came and introduced himself.  So yeah... great, chill, relaxed venue. Large doors that are kept open - so the fresh air is really nice! Completely recommend Diego Pops!",

Usually a place that has that price range like Puesto in San Diego or several taco food trucks in LA they have amazing tacos. Maybe it was a bad day but the steak and the chicken tacos I had were way over cooked and honestly only tasted like the sauce you chose to put on in. The add on for rice and beans were 2 dollars which got you a ketchup cup of each lol my wife's tacos were a little bit better though. The corn tortillas weren't the greatest either",

    "text": "I FINALLY made it here for lunch with the fam! I loved the laid back, colorful, and breezy atmosphere. It is a great place to come with groups.  To start, we ordered the much anticipated brussels sprout nachos. I've been seeing photos of them for days and was dying to try them. They definitely lived up to their hype and were DELICIOUS. I loved the garlic beet crema and of course the egg on top! The brussels had a great roasted flavor as well. We also ordered their guacamole which was fantastic, along with their homemade salsa (but watch out, garlic breath)!   For my entree, I had the kale caesar salad with their green chile chicken on top and it was super filling + delish. The avocado was a great addition. My family members got tacos for their entrees and I must say, the 3 broken chips that came on the side were a little lame! My suggestion would be to give more chips or maybe a more appealing side all together since chips are complimentary at the start anyway. Everyone at the table commented on this!   All in all, I really liked the vibe and eats so i'm sure we'll be back again with friends! I didn't try their margaritas since I was there for lunch but will most definitely try one another time! They looked pretty!",

    "text": "Is there any Mexican food in Scottsdale that isn't out of this world? that's what I was asking myself after lunching at Diego Pops, one of numerous impressive eateries I visited while on a work trip.   (I should preface my review of the food itself with a disclaimer of sorts: This isn't truly authentic Mexican food. In fact, I've found very, very few places north of the border that could qualify as such. Diego Pops definitely appeals to a more touristy demographic and the local college scene.) However, that makes them no less delicious. The braised green chili chicken taco includes an incredibly flavorful mixture of crema, cotija and house slaw. I highly recommend getting it on the crispy tortilla for that perfect combination of taste and texture. The grilled shrimp was equally tasty, served atop corn salsa, red onion, queso oaxaca and salsa verde.   I could see this place becoming sort of a madhouse at peak hours, but thankfully we ate a late lunch and avoided any real rush. The outdoor patio, with big tables and a slatted overhang to keep you semi-protected from the sun, is a great place to eat and drink. If I could suggest changing anything, it would be to recommend just a plain iced tea to serve. I don't need the fancy stuff.",

The bar was busy and they make a lot of custom margaritas, so the initial contact was a little slow. After a bit we settled with our own margaritas that were made with fresh juice and good tequila. We also had the Brussels sprouts nachos. You gotta get those. The fried egg on top - what doesn't have one these days - was actually a nice topping and did go with our margaritas. I also chose a bowl with fish, black beans and brown rice. Also good. I would definitely go back.",

I had the Crispy cod bowl with coconut rice, pickled onions and some hot chipotle sauce.  I loved the slaw and how the whole bowl just made sense.  I can't wait to try others!!!    We also ordered a steak taco which the meat was done tenderly and seasoned perfectly. The shell stood up to the filling and didn't fall apart in your hands.  It was great!!  We also tried a pork and pineapple burrito.  First thing is the delicious flour tortilla.... WOW! It also stood up to all the beans and rice and mouth watering pineapple with tender pieces of pork. It's a big burrito!!  We would definetly order it again.  The chips .... just crispy and wonderful!!!  We were seriously impressed right down to their to go ware.  Very nice.  Can't wait to order this again!! Yummy!!",

Great variety and great flavor. Let's chat about their spicy guacamole and freshly fried tortilla chips. Each bite had a little kick to it making it totally unboring.  However, my caesar salad was boring, not gonna lie. The grilled shrimps were tasty, but overall the salad was huge in size, but not on flavor. I definitely added a ton of hot sauce and the garlic crema to add a bit of a kick.  My friend's tacos were touted as big, but they ended up not being huge. She's also a veggie and probably ordered wrong. And when I say probably, I mean she did. I'd also suggest ordering the flour vs corn tortillas as they looked absolutely authentically, hand made.  The brussels nachos were delicious but not what one expects. Their nachos are just your regular nachos with some brussels involved, not brussels sprouts covered in nacho cheese and the works, which is what I really wanted and so does everyone else in the entire world.   Service was wonderful. The cocktails looked wonderful. All in all, a huge win.",

However, the service gets a one for me.    I went during happy hour. Happy Hour is everyday from 3pm-6pm. 1/2 of appetizers, $3 beers, $4 margaritas, $5 wine and sangria. Let me just warn all though...apparently their quesadilla appetizer is not included in the 1/2 off. No where does it say this. And trust me, the wait staff doesn't care.   To be honest, it took the wait staff 10 minutes to even acknowledge me at the table. They all seemed very uninterested in being warm, friendly, or in assisting customers period. Then it took them another 10 to get me a weak margarita. The food was all beautifully plated, the restaurant was quaint, and the food mediocre. Favorite dish was the Brussels Sprout Nachos.  All and all, cute place. Hopefully they can step up their service, until then, there are much better places to go.",

I really liked the overall decor of this place, with really fun wall signs and a casual SoCal decor. Since I was by myself, I decided to sit at the outside bar (patio).  For my meal, i ordered chips and salsa, the charred skirt steak taco, and a Tolum poke bowl. The chips and salsa were really good, and both tasted fresh.  I powered through these quickly. The taco was okay, and probably not something I would order again. The Poke bowl was delicious. On a hot day, it hit the spot.  The only real negative about this place was the service. They were slightly inattentive and I had to work hard to get their attention. Overall, this place is deserving of another visit.",

It wasn't busy at all but server was apologetic and comped our food. However the next time the same exact thing happened. Not busy at all, took 20 minutes to get our margaritas and another hour for our food. Our waitress wasn't apologetic and joked that food is taking a while today.

From 3 - 6 p.m. (7 DAYS A WEEK!) you can get half off apps, $5 wine + sangria, $4 house margaritas, and $3 beers. Not to mention their Taco Monday special, or all day happy hour Sunday! These people are killin' the game. The vibes are so cute - you'll never want to leave, and staff is so friendly and fun! If you can't tell, I'm just very passionate about this place (lol).  The most recent time I came here, my friend and I split THE FAMOUS nachos, a quesadilla, and their mango habanero wings. Everything has such a unique flavor! Especially when you top your food with their selection of special sauces. The roasted garlic beet one (pink) tops a few of their their dishes, and is my absolute favorite!   The nachos are simply a must try. Like, you have to get these!!! My friend had the brilliant idea of adding BBQ chicken to our quesadilla and I'm so glad that we did. It was 10/10 amazing. I'll be getting this every time from now on. As for the mango habanero wings, they weren't for me. They definitely weren't bad, but I'm not a mango person, and I don't really like things with a kick to them! If you like sweet + spicy things, you'll love them!   To sum up my most enthusiastic review of all time, COME HERE. You will be hooked on their good prices, good food, good portions!",

    "text": "Ugh!  Cool vibe, interesting menu, good drinks...but the worst service.   Per usual, we sat the bar.  It took the bartenders a good bit of time to acknowledge us, but when they finally did we ordered two cocktails (Mexican mule and the watermelon mint margarita) - both were good.   There were quite a few interesting drink choices so I was already looking forward to trying another!   We started with the brussels sprout nachos. However, when they arrived - neither bartender stopped over to give us plates, napkins, silverware or just to say hey, all okay.  We had to wave down the bar-back to give us plates but still no silverware.  When the bartender finally came over, we asked for it.  No apologies for the wait.  We finally had all we needed to enjoy; albeit a tad cold, they were really good and we just about ate entire thing.  As it turns out, that was a good thing.  We were never asked if we wanted another drink or more food. We were so turned off, that we flagged down a bartender for the check. Had our one drink, one appetizer and bounced.     I think they know they have a cool thing going, and people will come anyway.  It's too bad.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to Diego Pops for a really long time, ever since I came to Scottsdale as a tourist years ago and saw a little hut-like establishment with a neon pink sign outside. I finally went inside and was greeted by the coolest walls ever. There was a sign that read \"Peace, Love & Tequila\" - awesome life mantra -, a badass picture of Frida up, anda bright neon phrase in Spanish with \"Mexico\" lit up in pink. I'd of course, heard about their delicious tacos, and trust me, they were amazing, but what really stole the show were the Brussel Sprout Nachos! First of all, I know this sounds a strange. Brussel Sprouts? Really? But just go ahead and order it with your friends/family/significant other and you will not regret it. The Brussel Sprouts, Oaxaca cheese, picked onions, and even a fried egg - all of it worked together. The cheese was so creamy and balanced out the sprouts while the nachos provided a base. I'm still perplexed on why this dish tasted so delicious. I honestly almost forgot about my tacos because I became distracted with these Brussel Sprout Nachos, that's how good they were! As for service, I am knocking one star off because service was a little slow, despite not having too many people there, and our food was out and waiting to be picked up at the counter so that by the time it got to us it was lukewarm.  Despite this, it won't deter me from returning. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to try their margaritas, but they have both a Watermelon Mint Margarita and a Prickly Pear Margarita which both sound bomb. Or just my excuse to go back!",

Went in with a group of 8 to celebrate my birthday, put our name in and was told 25 minutes - patiently waited the 50 minutes it ended up being for the table and it was a table for 7. So, not a big deal, we just asked our server if we could pull up a chair. She blatantly refused and said \"we can't pull up chairs here\". I could understand if it was super tight and possibly a fire hazard, but this was not the case. She then offered no reasonable alternative and left one of my friends standing at the table. When we asked to speak to the manager, he essentially said the same thing with no remorse. All of this over a chair! All I would ask is that if you can't accommodate a larger group, do not mislead them and have them wait for nearly an hour just to have to leave.... this was a major bummer.",

Cons: Service. it was disappointing having to valet on a weeknight during the summer. My friends and I walked in behind another group. There was already a large group in the entrance waiting as well. We stood for 5 mins and none of the staff members even looked our way.   Eventually, we approached a waiter near the bar who was rude and told us to wait to be seated, and we said there had been no host and we'd been waiting for quite some time. He said our name would get put down on the list and that there was a 15 minute wait even though a majority of the patio tables were open. We head back to the entrance the hostess comes up to us saying \"I thought you were with the big group\", so in that case she didn't have a good sense of her surroundings. She immediately seated us, so that other waiter was misinformed as well and lacked empathy.  Overall the staff seemed very unapologetic and unhappy. Not a lot of smiling going around, and it was awkward being on the patio with the male waiter we'd spoken to helping every other tables but ours, since we were assigned a different female waitress. You could tell he was trying to avoid us and it was blatantly obvious.  The nachos are so good but there are so many other good restaurants in town, so I won't be returning.",

They chose to seat people who are younger and more attractive first, in addition to giving them better service. I am only giving them two stars because the food is good. We waited 30 MINUTES for menus or water, and even told the hostess multiple times and she just brushed us off. It really is disappointing. In addition, the servers ask about chips and salsa but fail to point out that they aren't free (what Mexican food restaurant doesn't give free chips & salsa?). Also, the servers sound very immature and unprofessional using 'like' and sounding as if they are talking to friends instead of customers. The whole atmosphere feels as if it is run and managed by college or high school teenagers. Very unprofessional. Will not be coming back.",

We ordered the brussel sprout nachos which were highly recommended and I would say they were OK (I'm not a huge brussel sprout fan) but if you are, I would order them. They come with a selection of different salsas which I enjoyed. We also ordered a few of the tacos: steak, green chili chicken and cod and they were not bad. I would order again.  I would go back to try the drinks and some of the desserts which sounded delicious.  My only complaint is that it seems as if they raised their prices without adjusting the menus as the pricing on our bill was different for each item than what was listed on the menu (which they let you use as a placemat so you could easily go back and compare the pricing). Not a huge deal but the server/manager didn't seem too thrilled to adjust the pricing on our bill to the menu price (which they didn't do it properly, they just knocked off $1 for \"inconvinence\").",

Their different \"bowls\" are both tasty and plentiful and they provide a real nice variety of fairly unusual sauces to put on it as you go.  Their standard salsa with the $2 chips n salsa order was outstanding.  As for their tacos....take a pass on the crispy pork one, for sure....too greasy. :-(  The bartender and his assistant in training  were both very friendly.  But, our server was more interested/focused at times early on in us answering her questions, vs. her answering ours......she got more helpful as time wore on. My \"shrimp\" bowl was good, but I felt sorry for our friend with the taco (it looked pitiful) that ended up ordering a dinner salad.  Not sure I'd go back.I give it three stars, because three of the four of us (that had bowls) were satisfied. I suspect it is a better evening \"bar scene\" place than a lunch spot for the more \"vintage ones\" like ourselves.   Seems to be many other nice choices in this nice area near \"old town\" though.",

My second visit I shared the Tulum Poke on coconut rice. I was disappointed because I love poke. The fact that they have 3 different options for poke they just pour the sauce on top of the poke instead of it being marinated in the sauce. It was lack luster in taste and small portion of Tuna on a heaping mound of rice. We had the street corn dip which was good but not hot enough in temperature.  I had the chicken green chile taco and shrimp taco. I felt that everything is just under seasoned and I am not a huge salt fan. The plethora of sauces help liven up the tacos. I had the coconut margarita, it came in a cool mini coconut, but I feel the coconut water does not go well with the margarita mix. The atmosphere is adorable and I really want to like this place. I will come back in a couple of months to see if they have worked the kinks out. I really hope so!!",

We ordered our food and drinks and they arrived in a timely manor, but the food was not good. My husband ordered the green chili chicken plate and it was terrible. I had tacos, they weren't that great either.  It almost tasted like nobody gave a shit, if that makes sense. While we sat there a few other people came in to order food and we noticed that they never got silverware-one man had to get up himself to get it. We also heard the bartender complaining about working a double and also complaining about another coworker...I get it, but that is completely unprofessional especially when customers can hear and it does not excuse rude service. So not only was the food bad, but the whole experience in general left a bad taste in our mouths. I also have to add that I cannot believe a shot of casamigos is $15 (I had this with pineapple juice as a drink)...seriously...maybe if this was a nicer place, but come on. Just plain bad.",

We started with the street corn (you can get it on the cob or cut off) that's dusted with hot Cheetos. Delicious. I'm not usually into gimmicky foods, but this was not only pretty, it tasted good too. To balance things off we got a communal dish of guacamole that had some nice flavor to it. It comes with tortilla and plantain chips, but I ended up using a generous amount on my main.  For the entree I went with the machaca bowl with black beans and rice. It had some nice heat to it and the addition of the table guac we ordered really put it over the top. The portions were generous and I didn't feel overly stuffed after eating. I'd definitely come back to try their other options... and to take on their California Burrito!",

    "text": "They have plantains here! That's game over for me. My mom used to cook them for me when I was growing up, so they've always been a comfort food for me, so when I saw it on the menu, I was immediately excited, enthralled, and jumping up and down in jubilation. The crazy thing is... the guac and chips appetizer not only included traditional tortilla chips, there were banana chips thrown in the mix. Way to go the extra mile Diego Pops! (However, if you are not into plantains or bananas, I guess that could be your nightmare, but to each their own, right?)  Happy hour is what drew us in. $4 margaritas are an excellent deal especially when drinks are triple or quadruple that when we go to Vegas.   The tacos had quite the variety. You could get flour or corn tortillas and if you got flour, you could also get it fried. That's what I did when I ordered pork and pineapple taco. I also got two other ones to try.. the carne asada taco and the fried battered cod taco. I had them with a side of coconut rice and black beans. The sides were smaller when served with the tacos, but that's okay, because these tacos were definitely larger than street tacos. I probably would've been fine with just two. They were really tasty!  We were full from drinking and eating dinner, but there's always room for dessert. I've found it to be True that there's an extra separate tummy for dessert. The sweetness of choice that won me over was the churro with soft serve ice cream. Amazeballs.   The restaurant itself is a treat for the eyes, full of color and vibrance in every direction. The Saltillo tile floors are warm and inviting. The cozy patio with hanging lights makes you feel at home. I beckon you to come visit and enjoy happy hour here!",

Must gets: chips and salsa (salsa packs on some heat but is clearly homemade and delicious) | the cold coconut rice as a side or part of a bowl (it's a little sweet but pairs so well with the meat and fish) | the cod taco was my favorite with the spicy mayo sauce | the beef taco was my fiance's favorite. We also tried the street corn queso -- wow!! So good too!   The service was impeccable. Our waiter was attentive to every last request and checked on us frequently. Not to mention had an extremely positive attitude which just made for a fun experience!   This is the first restaurant in a long while where we left having no gripes or complaints.   We HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

    "text": "If you walk in the door at Diego Pops seeking authentic Mexican food (or at least Mexican food that most valley residents are familiar with), allow me to echo fellow Yelpers in saying you won't find much of that here.  The majority of the menu is Mexican-inspired to be sure, but with a decidedly Scottsdale hipster spin.  Sonoran Hot Dog?  Yes.  Burritos, yup.  Tacos?  Sure, but not the ones you're likely accustomed to.  Poke?  Wait, why is Poke on a Mexican restaurant menu?  So much of this place is confusing to me, but I'll do my best to clarify.  You'll find Diego Pops in Old Town Scottsdale, right on the west side of Scottsdale Road just south of Stetson Drive.  The restaurant occupies what was once one of Old Town's many pottery shops.  Owners Ryan and Caitlin Jocque (you may remember them as the founders of Original ChopShop) opened this place in 2014 with the idea of showcasing more of a Yucatan Mexican-inspired influence in their food more-so than the Sonoran Mexican influences that dominate the valley foodscape.  The space itself has a bunch of different personalities.  The indoor/outdoor bar is a fairly common staple of the Old Town restaurant scene, the outdoor patio has the look and feel almost of a sports bar, and the interior dining area is a mix of wooden furniture accents and booths that look like the back seat of a 1950s convertible.  If nothing else, the mix of colors certainly stand out.  I grabbed a spot at the bar for lunch on a gorgeous Fall Saturday and examined my options.  For starters, a Mexican brew.  A glass of Bohemia, because...well...Viva Mexico.  I asked the bartender what the big staple items were at this place, fully expecting that she would list off some of the taco and burrito favorites.  But no, she pointed me instead to an appetizer item.  The two other bartenders could be heard in the background saying in unison \"yeah, you need to try that\".  This apparently magical appetizer?  Brussels Sprout Nachos.  Yeah, I had the same reaction you probably would have.  The full specs on these:  Tortilla chips, roasted and charred brussel sprouts, lots of Oaxaca cheese, ground street corn, chilis, pickled onion, garlic, beet crema, and finished with a fried egg on top.  Again, color me dubious, but I shall play along.  This rainbow colored dish soon arrived in front of me looking like a strange but manageable concoction.  As with any nacho dish there's no getting around getting your fingers dirty which I'm totally fine with.  The flavors of this dish were quite pleasant.  I especially liked what the ground corn and beet crema brought to the party with a hint of subtle sweetness from both.  The tray didn't look that imposing, but by the time I got towards the end, my stomach felt like I'd consumed an entire wheel of cheese.  Overall though its a pretty decent dish, though I think it would've been better with some of their taco meats like skirt steak, green chili chicken, or even pork.  The nachos finished me off this go around before I could order anything else.  Total cost for the beer, nachos, tax, and tip came to $20.  I'll give the staff props for at least compelling me to try something unique and different, though I wouldn't say I was really wowed.  If I'm here again I might give the tacos a shot, but bear in mind you won't find Carne Asada, Cochinita Pibil, or Lengua or other Sonoran old school favorites here.  Nope we're talking pineapple infused pork, plantain, and even cod.  And there's Poke on the menu here for reasons I still don't understand.  So I guess I'm still not sure what to make of this place.  A hipster vibe and an odd menu are par for the course in Old Town, sure.  But thus far Diego Pops leaves me particularly perplexed.",

The wings are amazing, tried several tacos and the Brussels sprouts nachos, all items I'd get again on my next visit.  Definitely get the Mexican sodas they have on hand",

    "text": "I'm giving this 4 stars for the food and ambiance, but I'll echo what others say about the service being poor. I came on Friday night for a late dinner and the place was packed. I put my name on the list and asked the hostess how long the wait would be. She didn't seem to know and was surprised that I asked that question. After asking again, she finally told me it would be 15 min. Overall, she wasn't professional and seemed inexperienced.   The wait was closer to 25 minutes and we were seated on the outdoor patio. We ordered the Brussels sprouts nachos which were so delicious! They are served on a big pan and they are filling! As an appetizer it serves 3-4 people. There were only 2 of us and after eating most of them, we were pretty full and regretted having ordered entrees.   We both ordered bowls- I got the green Chile chicken and my sister got the pineapple pork. We both chose the coconut rice. The bowls were delicious and we ended up bringing more than half of the food home since we were so full from the nachos.   While the food was good, the service was very disappointing. Our waitress would just walk by our table and not approach us. I had to flag her down each time we wanted to order and then had to flag her down again to get the check. She disappeared for a while and We were stuck waiting a bit before we could even get the check.   Overall, this restaurant was fun. The vibes were good and the decor was cute and instsgrammable. I'll come back because the food was good, but I sure hope the service improves. It would really help if they got a more modern system for their waitlist. It would be a lot easier to receive a text when the table is ready considering the host staff were not very helpful.",

But the chicken drumsticks are amazing with a really spicy, tangy sauce served with slices of jicama and a creamy dressing. Everything is even better during Happy Hour (1/2 price drumsticks!!)  On the tables are six bottles of salsa ranging from mild to hot which allows patrons to customize their food.   There is a small but inviting patio where the bar is located. I have not been here when its crowded as parking could be an issue ( it is through out the 5th Avenue area). Servers are upbeat and helpful. Nice vibe to the place with retro decor.",

    "text": "I have to say, based on all the reviews I read, I was excited to try this place. It was said that the guacamole was to die for and the pork pineapple taco couldn't be beat. We had high hopes and unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed.   One thing that we found really refreshing and noteworthy was the service. Everyone was kind, prompt, easy to communicate with and seemed happy to be there. This is a big plus in my book.  The wait time for such mediocre food was kind of a shock. We called ahead to be told they take no reservations and have no texting service. Fine, we can deal with a 45 minute wait for 2 people if the food is so good. Right?   The margaritas were so boring. I had two in hopes the second would have some kick and flavour and was so wrong.  We ordered a guacamole app with a side of salsa. Two HUGE trays of chips came for us two people, with small portions of the dips. We actually told our server we will not eat it all if even half of it and she said it was the norm and left it. Weird. The guacamole was some of the blandest I've ever had, and the salsa was so watery and tasteless I could hardly eat it. Not a great start.   We ordered four different tacos and wow, what a sad experience. The chicken in one was undercooked so I didn't eat anymore than one bite, as well it lacked flavour. The pork pineapple was basically a sloppy soup with fruit chunks on it and that was the main reason for my visit so I was bummed. The crispy fish taco was more edible than the other two but still so bland I added all the sauces to help. The only good one was the Brussel sprout taco! We want to make these at home. So try these if you must visit.  The California burrito was small and again so boring it was like eating an edible image of the food rather than the food itself. In California this would be pretty bad.  I was really open to this place and left so underwhelmed I will not return. But the staff are nice, beer is predictable so just order that, and the Brussel sprout tacos are worth a shot.",

It is more tourist than I normally would spend time at but when company is in town and wants to be in that end of town it was great for modern Mexican food.",

We also had the bean burrito and plantains!  The salsa that came with the burrito was very flavorful .... I wasn't crazy about the sauces in the squeeze bottles.  Some were too mayo-y and garlic-y.  Plus they were not \"hot\" enough for me ... I enjoy habaneros!!  This place will be on the top of my list next Scottsdale trip!!  Vegetarian - Vegan friendly!",

When I suggested that he round up the empty tanks and get them filled he said \"do I go to your job and tell you how to do it\" ahh no you wouldn't have to because I'm smart enough to solve the problem and not wait 2 weeks for propane tanks! Margarita's were pricey and just ok. We just had queso/chips and nachos they were good. My son ordered a burrito, it never came. Based on rude management will not go back.",

We had Collin helping us out and he was amazing! I am from San Diego so this heat is very different for me,so I had to try the snow cone margarita. Collin warned me that it would be sweet, but it was just perfect, great tequila and super girly! To eat I had the Brussel sprout nachos and shrimp taco, I cannot say enough about the amazing sauces that they offer. Not just the sauce they put on the meal but they bring out 6 different sauces for the table as well. Our favorite sauce was the Serrano ranch...absolutely delicious!! My boyfriend got the California burrito which was either a flop or fail since Im from Cali but the meat was so delicious and tender, the corn included...great Cali burrito!!",

I was really hoping to get some real spicy food while I was there, unfortunately even their habanero sauce left something to be desired. Also one of the other people dining with me asked for a blended margarita and was told \"yeah, we don't do those here\".   It's Arizona......in 2019.... everyone owns a blender.",

I ordered and devoured the green chili chicken quesadilla with garlic beet Crema drizzled on top. Pair that with a margarita and you're golden! I opted for the prickly pear margarita because...when in Arizona.. I will say it wasn't the best margarita I've ever had but it was tasty.  My husband loved his plantain bowl! It's so great that you can choose between crispy or soft tacos or a bowl as well as all the sauce options brought to your table. Can't go wrong at Diego Pops!",

We had been here once before and I had been craving the amazing Brussels sprouts nachos.  Steven was a great server and made a ton of awesome recommendations.  We followed nearly every one, including three desserts that were by far the most amazing thing this mama has had in a long time.  The Braised Pineapple pork and Green Chili Chicken tacos were also on point! We will be back again very soon - and I will most definitely be asking to end the evening with a Campfire!  Thanks for an awesome evening out!!",

When I walked up I could automatically tell that this was a very hip and trendy place (which was great). The decor made me feel like I was in Palm Springs (I am from CA) and I loved it. It felt very retro. I sat at the bar outside to work and the waitress Destiny was great. Very sweet and personable. I was not able to get on their wifi, but I signed up to this Cox internet trial for an hour and was able to complete my work.   I ordered the chips and salsa to start (only $2). They bring them on a small cookie sheet and the salsa that comes with it is very good. Then they also give you an array of sauces to use. Stuff like Beet creme, Jalapeno ranch, habanero oil, etc. Next I ordered two tacos, the fried cod and the beef machaca. They were both very good. They have taco and bowl options. I recommend the taco for the fish and a bowl for the beef. The beef is amazing and very juicy so it broke the tortilla automatically. I think having it in a bowl would have made it better. But still delicious. I also had the watermelon mint marg which was good, but I must say it wasn't very strong for being $10.",

The quesadilla is yummy, however the ceviche lacks the tartness of a traditional, but still tastes good with a cucumber cream sauce. I really don't know about the extended menu, but it looks good. We just want to eat cheaply, so we end up around 50 bucks including food and 3 drinks each!! This is elevated Baja cuisine, not Sonoran Mexican food. But it's good in a casual fun way.",

Almost everything has been delicious and: Taco Monday!!!  Hopefully owners/managers read this bc two things: guacamole could be better/fresher. I like that you're going out on a limb with the orange in the guac but sometimes its a flavorless mess. Second, the salads. They are not good. I got the cabbage salad once. Blech. Guys, go check out the salad with cabbage at Grassroots. That's how you make a salad.  All in all, this place is a gem in a sea of mediocre old town choices.",

The crunchy fish taco had one of the best flour tortillas I've had - very thin and crunchy, not soft and chewy like many flour tortillas (which can be great as well.) The interior was really cute and fun, and the agua frescos wasn't overly sweetened. The music was a bit loud for lunchtime, but at least the song selection was good!",

The green Chile chicken needed a little more flavor, as did the pineapple pork.    We thought our server Paris was great!  She treated us well and checked on us often.  We'll be back to try out the rest of the tacos soon!",

I love the atmosphere, especially on the patio.  I wish the taste of the food was as good.    Overall, I found things to be underseasoned, and I am usually the one complaining about saltiness.  We started with the corn dip, which was alright but kind of ruined by the fact that it was lukewarm.  The chips were very fresh and crisp, though.  Then we had one of the poke dishes over rice--very bland.  If you want good poke, go a few blocks down to Hula's.  Then, I had a shrimp taco and a steak taco.  The steak had good flavor when I ate it alone, but the taco wasn't great.  Same with the shrimp taco.  I also taster my friend's pork entree.  He liked it, but, once again, I thought it was bland.  And, yes, I did try adding several of the different sauces that they provided, but I still wasn't crazy about anything.    I would like to go back to have drinks on the patio, but I'll probably have dinner elsewhere.  Or maybe I'll try the Brussel sprout nachos, which I'm told are very tasty.",

I am very picky eater and the waitress was super rude when I told her I didn't want my quesadilla topped with whatever it was topped with. She kept pressuring me to try it and i DID not appreciate it. I just wanted her to please get me a new plate. She definitely gave me attitude. I will not be returning.

I personally like really hot sauces and tried all of their house made sauces and none of them were hot, but did have good flavor.   My wife's salad was pretty good size and she got a good chunk of salmon.   The snow cone margarita has very very little alcohol and literally tastes like a snow cone, we ordered the watermelon and lime.   The local beer was excellent, it was the hop knot ipa from 4 peaks in Tempe. It's a great tasting beer and not overly hoppy.   It was great to try it, but i honestly would not go back.",

Not to mention the mango habanero margarita is one of THE BEST MARGARITAS IVE EVER HAD!!! I will 100% come back just for this. You know how most spicy margs are a little earthy?

She did not smile once or ask us how we were or how our day was when we were seated. There were no napkins, straws, or silverware either. I've heard many great things about this restaurant but I believe those reviews were just for the food not customer service or how the establishment is run.

Dinner is awkward and it might be \"policy\" to prevent parties from sitting together but it only leaves a bad taste in patrons mouths. We waited over 30 minutes for a party of 9 when a party of 8 sat down immediately. If you want to come with friends just stick to the bar because you will have mediocre service and will not be able to enjoy yourself at dinner with your friends because you are literally a table away.",

Seriously, the queso was very bland and had a curdled appearance and grainy texture and was lukewarm.  The bowls were ok, but mine was not composed with my bean of choice, and the waiter obviously didn't remember what I ordered and guessed while placing it in front of me.The bottom of my bowl was watery, perhaps from black beans and mushy brown rice?  I thought that the pork tasted as though it was marinated in a can of pineapple juice-- with a slight tinny taste. I'm feeling sad for previous reviewers who think this it really good Mexican food. Where have you been eating all of this time, Taco Bell? This food is terrible!",

The bartender, Skylar, welcomed me with a warm smile and instant charm. She made me feel like I was a regular on my first visit. The drink selection is seriously well thought out. I'm not a day drinker but at this lunch visit I was sorely tempted to try any one of Diego Pops margaritas.  And the food is soooo good! The menu seemed unfamiliar to me at first glance but the food is a traditional northern Mexican food, which I'm familar with here in Arizona but also southern Mexican (more tropical - plantains) fare elevated with the inclusion of a variety of chili sauces. Ask for the sixpack of chili sauces and try each - delicious. Recommendation: tortilla soup is outstanding and the green chili chicken bowl (or crispy taco) is remarkably flavorful. I love it. There is small a charge for chips and salsa but it's worth it on the days I want them - other days I'd prefer to go without so it works out well for me.",

Their selection of tacos is good, although as an ex-vegetarian of almost 11 years, I do wish they had one more veggie choice besides the plantain. I've also had a burrito for lunch once; it was huge and chock full of goodness. The green chili chicken can't be beat for a taco/burrito filling, and I also recommend the crispy cod (I'm not the hugest fish fan, but it is tasty-fried goodness.)  I LOVE the ambiance here. The inside wallpaper/lighting/decor is so cute and makes me want to deck out my house in trendy-Mexican-tropical-abode-chic. Pineapple print walls, anyone? The patio has a great fireplace to sit by, with tons of twinkly lights.   Their sauce/salsa caddie is fun. If you order a chips and salsa appetizer, you can't beat a selection of house salsa, plus 6 (I think?!) extra choices!  All in all, a pretty glorious Old Town choice.",

This one had a slightly smokey flavor.  Tortilla chips & plantain chips- we got the dual mix of chips. They were both very crisp and fresh. Not oily & perfectly salted. The only downside to our batch was that the plantain chips were broken and crumbled up... like if we got the bottom of the bunch.  Pork tacos- very flavorful & juicy meat. The corn Tortilla was so fresh that it just broke apart when trying to pick up the taco.  We didn't get to try any fancy drinks, however the drink served in the fresh young coconut looked delicious!  Lastly, it was 100+ degrees, we were seated outside & the misters around the bar definitely topped off our experience!   We'll be back soon!",

It's all things coconut and fresh and scrumptious and refreshing all at the same time! My party were lame and two of them ordered Coronas the entire time but again the waitress was spot on and kept them coming.  We shared an order of guacamole and salsa and all I can say is **Y U M** the food that they kept bringing out for everyone else smelled delicious AND looked amazing.

A spin on authentic Mexican, the menu is full of fun creations like Brussel sprout nachos, plantain tacos, a pineapple kale salad (my fave with steak), and even house-made desserts like mini churros that come with a dipping sauce board YUMMMM. Happy hour is decent here as well with half off appetizers, attentive staff, prompt service, and Don Julio on tap (yes, the rumors are True). Taco Monday's during happy hour when the bartender nick is there has become my new go to for Monday evening eats. Lastly, the snow cone margarita might seem like a good idea but, for all you tequila lovers, it's just a tourist attraction.",

Our only downside of the evening was when our server disappeared for about 45 minutes and we were waiting to order dessert...When he finally reappeared, we inquired about desserts - \"...possibly some type of ice cream?\" He looked at us like we were crazy. So we point out that we had seen a guest eating an ice cream cone. *crickets* We then point out the guy eating the ice cream cone and our waiter turns around to see what we are talking about. After he turns around he says, \"Oh! Yes, we have ice cream.\" (Sweet....I think we are getting somewhere...)We are finally able to get our hands on a dessert menu and ordered the Toasted Coconut Ice Cream Sundae - Pretty yummy! The ice cream was rather tart and we were looking forward to the coconut whipped cream (which was missing). Honestly, service deserved 2 stars. Food - 5 stars all the way!

The weather is getting nicer after the sun goes down and we thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the patio getting to enjoy it...and our margaritas.  Our server Taylor was fun and really helped us navigate our way through the menu. She recommended items and they did not disappoint. My husband is pretty picky about what he likes and everything he ordered was brought to him just as he specified. The pitcher of margaritas our server convinced us to get may have helped his mood though! Delicious! Lol  We will be back for sure - relaxed, casual, great service and delicious food!",

Nice flavor and served on white corn soft tortilla. I was really impressed by the green chili taco  lots of layered flavors.  I would order this one without hesitation. Although, I walked here, it appears that parking may be an issue when the next door neighboring restaurant re-opens.   All in all, a great new casual dining spot in Old Town.",

We just recently went there for a Sunday fun day and we were a fairly large group which they accommodated immediately and got us sat quickly. I do get that we were a large group, but, I felt it took a little too long for us to receive our drinks. Our server was extra friendly but it was obvious he was nervous serving such a large party. I feel if he had extra support from management these things would of been avoided. It took us at least 20 minutes to receive our first cocktails at our table after ordering them. Again the server was awesome and friendly so I don't blame him for that. I felt as I observed around that we were the closest table near the kitchen that it was obvious we were large and our server needed help running drinks from the bartender it wasn't that busy that someone especially higher up in management would consider coming by to help and support the waiter. That is the only feedback I can give that is negative but the food is completely recommended. I had the shrimp taco and steak taco and they were super yummy. Our table also got ceviche and Brussel sprouts nachos, which I highly recommend.",

    "text": "We had some pretty high hopes for Diego Pops considering all of the positive reviews!  It failed in every area except location and decor.  Food: With all of the amazing Mexican food in the Phoenix area (and we tried a ton), this was without a doubt the worst and most un-authentic tasting we have had, and we're from Canada! If I was a mexican chef or patron, I would be seriously offended by eating this.   The most bland, pedestrian, flavourless mexican food in Phoenix, hands down.  The guacamole came out cold and without flavour.  Have you ever shopped at costco? this was their guac.  I can only imagine the \"chef\" scooping this out of large container in the fridge.  The cheese quesadilla was luke warm cardboard, and we couldn't eat it.  The queso corn dip was so bland and soupy, it was pretty much a corn chowder.  how hard is it to grill corn and then cut it off into some queso?  Apparently impossible at Diego Pops, but not every other restaurant we ate at and tried this dish.  The tacos were really boring, and the jalapenos weren't even cut through and spread out in the tacos, lazy lazy chef skills there, just a chunk of pepper.  Seriously though, are the chefs shopping for ingredients at costco?  a few hours from mexico, in a high end area, and this place gets all these good reviews and is still able to pay the rent?  wow.  The drinks:  if you still decide to go here and waste your money, order beer.  the sangria was without a doubt the worst we have had anywhere in the world (and that includes the cheapest Spanish bar you could walk into).  We didn't drink them and sent them back.  Had the bartender ever tasted Sangria?  Hold on, what bartender! It was actually our inattentive server (more on that later) doing the mixing.  Seriously, I would be embarrassed to charge anything for this Sangria.  Have the owners ever eaten at a Mexican restaurant before?  I ordered a beer, and it was the only redeeming part of the meal.  The service: Worst in Phoenix, hands down.  Inattentive young girls with too much makeup who are clearly much too interstesed in gossiping with each other than doing their jobs.  Our server forgot quite a few items we ordered (which worked out better in the end).  Took away almost full plates of food and almost full drinks and didn't ask if we liked them or not.  They were devoid of personality, and looked equally at home serving drinks at a bar by the airport.  If you've ever been to the Cactus club in Canada, this was the arizona equivalent.    I would recommend the owners actually eating elsewhere in the Phoenix to get some perspective on just how bad everything is.  Barrio Cafe or Tranquilo would be a good start.  Fresh, local, innovative, and authentic.  its really not that hard.  If you're visiting or a local, skip this place.  The reviews are deceiving.",

You wait for about 20 mins for you drinks to be made after you order them (the waiters never come while you wait so you can order) and they are VERY weak, but then the wait staff does not come back and check on you at all then it takes forever to order or get their attention. Fire EVERYONE except the cooks that works there and get some servers who know how to serve and are competent. Maybe my last time going in there since serves truly are the worst. Maybe try Loco Patron for your taco needs. At least, they know how to serve and check on their section.",

    "text": "\"SAY YES TO TACOS!\"   Hmm, I hadn't thought of it like that before... but as I make a point of always listening to demands made by illuminated changeable letter signs (like the one in the front of Diego Pops, ushering me toward a life of complete taco acceptance,) I decided this lunch time would be taco time!  Our group ordered a bunch of apples and then flew solo for the Entrees. The appy that stuck out most to me - The Brussels Sprout Nachos!  Did your inner child just twinge at that thought of putting Brussels sprouts on nachos? You should have! You should have just experiences a quick flash back to the overly steamed, and just downright terrible Brussels sprouts mom would either force feed you, or use to hold our dessert ransom until we had finished them. And now, you're telling me this Dr. Doom and Bane (big green guy from Batman)'s love child is coming after nachos, the most delicious food you can think of off the top of your head?! Not on this yelper's plate!  You can take a breath, Inner Child, because these nachos are the bomb! The thing is, you mom made brussels sprouts wrong. Sorry Mom... You don't steam them for days, you cut them in half then flash fry them in a super hot pan so you burn their little faces off. Then you put them on nachos and they're the best thing in the world!   The only thing that could possible top them is the pink (aioli?) sauce they serve with it. It's coloured pink with beets, but its tastes like a mashup of garlic, creamy egg somthin-or-other, and love. I want to put this on everything now and do shots of it at parties.  The tacos - yeah, they were pretty good. Sorta like street side tacos, except fancied up in some form or another. Fancier, but not necessarily better.  All in all, it's a funky little place with delicious Mexican influenced dishes and I'd be happy to check them out again.",

This was a Saturday night at 6 but the place was pretty empty. We were promptly greeted by our server, I forgot her name, and drinks came out right away. We had the chips and salsa, street corn dip and a variety of tacos. The green chili chicken, bbq adobo and pineapple pork were all very tasty. You can have them on soft flour or corn or hard shell. The sweet corn ceaser and totrtilla soup were both a hit with our group as well. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is so cute. I'll definitely go back!  Update! I went in yesterday and Levi was our server. He was training someone and they were fantastic! The sangria was tasty and we tried the guacamole, which was creamy and delicious. I did a salad that was awesome. Quinoa, seeds, papaya and we added steak. It was with the best vinaigrette I think Ive ever had. Coconut! Amazeballs. Plantain taco was also great. All 5 of us really loved everything. This place is highly recommended.",

    "text": "Good taco & ambience, but their service and chips were so terrible that I question ever coming back.  My fiance and I were greeted by the hostess and were seated.  About five minutes later someone came by and asked if our server came by, we said no and ordered our drinks and chips & salsa.  We got our chips & salsa and about 40% of the chips were stale. They tasted like they were cheap restaurant-style chips (which are typically large), but we're obviously broken into smaller pieces. The salsa wasn't bad, but nothing to return for.  As we chomped on chips which many were just plain hard,  we wondered where our drinks were and we wished we had ordered waters to tide us over while we wait for our drinks.  Another waitress came by (I guess the waitress the other one talked about?) and saw that we were half way through our chips & salsa with no drinks. She asked if we would like waters and we quickly responded, yes please.  We never received our waters although that waitress passed us over six times afterwards.  The patio was almost full, but there was only one group inside.  There were two bartenders and a whole bunch of servers which were mostly talking to each other and putting orders in.  Fifteen minutes after ordering we got our drinks, we were almost done with our chips.  At that point we were asked if we wanted to order entrees.  Based on the wait I decided to just get one BBQ chicken taco. I only had to wait about five minutes and I enjoyed the taco. But honestly it was soured by the poor experience.  I acknowledge that maybe we got the bottom of the chip bin, but the server confusion, forgetfulness and over ten minute wait for 2 drinks all on a Sunday that wasn't that busy is just disappointing.  With such a variety of taco places, I can't recommend this place.",

But even without HH prices, it is well worth what you get!  My first visit was 8 days ago on a 'Two Dollar Taco Monday'. 6 days later on Sunday, my friend and I were craving it again. The next day/Monday when another friend needed dinner, I said - Hey, it's Taco Monday, you've got to try this place. 3 times in 8 days with different people, ordering various items and drinks. Everything, EVERYTHING was A+ all 3 times!  To top it off, of the approximately5-6 employees that we interacted with, every single one of them was helpful, caring, friendly, clean and efficient!   Keep up the great work!! Especially LOVE the patio!",

We were a large group, but the restaurant wasn't very busy so it seemed like it would be fine. We had pre-ordered appies and the brussel sprout nachos were seriously to. die. for. They were outstanding! 5 stars for those, that's for sure! The sprouts were cooked perfectly and the cheese and sauce on the nachos complimented them so well - the fried egg was an added creamy bonus! The guacamole was also delicious, very fresh!  For my main I should have got tacos but decided to be healthy and get a salad. I asked the server which salad was best (I was indecisive and trying to be quick) and she suggested the Caesar. Usually I'm not a Caesar fan, but this had purple kale, corn, and avocado (YUM) so I thought I'd give it a shot. She asked if I wanted to add meat and I took her suggestion of the BBQ chicken.   When my food arrived I was disappointed to see it was mostly romaine with very small pieces of purple kale. The 'croutons' were tortilla chips, which was unique but I wish they had stated that on the menu. The chicken was my least favourite part as I found it quite flavourless, unfortunately. The salad was ok but not something I'd order again.  The rest of our table's food trickled in slowly with a couple of small errors to our orders. One of our party asked three times for tortillas, and by the time they finally arrived he took three bites of his food and had to leave.   I would come back with a much smaller group and try some of their other food - the nachos alone would make me come back! I just wouldn't have the salad again...",

One of the people from our party asked the waiter if there was a fan or anything to make it more comfortable and he just shrugged us off and continued with his slow service.

Our waitress was rather quiet and challenging to hear- especially when we asked kindly for her to repeat the item description we asked about. We were not being serviced properly, and my boyfriend had to GET UP to get the hot sauce tray himself. Finally- towards the end of our experience, we had to flag someone down to get us a to go box. I'm sure this was an isolated incident, but I wanted to bring this to your attention in hopes that other first time patrons experience a more enjoyable meal.

I like the decor, there's a large patio space and there is plenty of room inside that kinda reminds me of a standard Mexican restaurant but with splotches of chic vintage decor.  Happy hour deal is awesome.  Taco Mondays are awesome.  The pricing is not even close to greedy which is rare in Old Town.  The food is good too!  We tried just about one of every taco and the only one I was a little disappointed by was the skirt steak one - needs more flavor.  BUT this can be easily remedied by a large array of sauces/salsas that come to the table with your food!  We also tried the fish taco which was excellent.  The braised pork and chicken ones are solid.    Its so refreshing to find an establishment in Old Town that's just so good all around!  Great food, great service, AND great pricing??  This is one of my favorite spots already!",

No small detail or corner has been overlooked, and the vibe is so chill but also upscale. Ordered the Diego margarita, delicious and very high quality tasting. We had an order of brussel sprout nachos because Yelp told us we had to, and they were absolutely incredible. The garlic beet sauce and cheese on them was SO good. For tacos, I had the green chili chicken, cod, and shrimp. All very fresh and well dressed with ingredients that worked great. I've had a lot of tacos in the valley, and these were definitely top notch!!  We asked our server at one point about doing a group party there for our rehearsal dinner, and he had the manager come out to talk to us. Cory, the GM/owner, came out and talked to us for about 20 minutes, which we thought was really cool of him to do. Highly recommend!",

I thought the parking situation was going to be terrible but we got lucky finding a spot not far from the place and when we walked up there was plenty of parking in front and on the side of the building. We got seated right away and I instantly love the decor and the music. For a Sunday it wasn't packed but a good crowd was in attendance.  They have a fairly large patio and outside bar area. We sat down and about 2 minutes passed as we perused the menu that doubled as a placemat. One of the waitress walked up and asked if anyone helped us yet and explain that she wasn't our waitress and confused to where our waitress was but she would be happy to take our drink order.  We ordered drinks and chips and salsa ($2), they came out promptly while we continued to wait for our drinks. Almost halfway into our chips and salsa another waitress out of nowhere asks if we needed drinks and we gave her our order too. She walked by 3 times after asking us and never brought us anything. Finally we got our drinks 20-ish minutes. :( This place is nice but the service is not so great. Our \"waitress\" was nice and friendly but we never seen our original waitress.  The chips were a bad mix of yesterday's chips and today's chips. I didn't want to waste anymore money here on food.  In short I was disappointed.  Prolly not coming back.",

The food was great. I loved the green chili chicken taco- Crispy  I also had the charred skirt steak which was also good. I rated this place 3 stars however for the service. We asked to be moved outside as soon as a spot opened and she ignored us for a long time on a slow day. I asked for the guava coconut drink and our waitress said they were out of coconuts as I proceeded to watch a girl at the next table receive a drink out of a coconut. I had to ask for my water to be refilled. They were also out of a lot of drink items. I would have rated this place 5 stars if the service wasn't so bad.",

Entirely unoriginal, but you can hear the sincerity in my voice. \"Where are you from?\" I ask, mystified by ethnic ambiguity.   He laughs. \"Half-Mexican, half-Hawaiian,\" he says in a way where I can tell he's been asked that question by many a suitor before me.  After a whirlwind of an evening with the Mexican Trail Mix Salad, topped with adobo BBQ chicken (a plethora of green things, crunchy things, fruity things, and a tangy bird), I'm left with a sudden realization.   It may have only been one night, and sure, I only know half of Diego (and I couldn't even tell you whether or not it's his better half) but hell, I'm in it, and I'm in it to win it.",

They have half off all appetizers so we ordered he nachos and the queso. Both were delicious and VERY fulfilling. They gave us their salsas and all of them were really good. None of the salsas are spicy (in my opinion) but still tasty. We had the green chicken taco and the pork braised pineapple tacos. I was very impressed! They are  bigger than usual and full of flavor. We also had the coconut ice cream and the churro fries. Also delicious! You have to get the coconut ice cream, it's a must.  Our server Britney was the best! She was attentive, nice and fun. She kept up with us as we got a little buzzed. Seriously, she made the experience that much better.  Overall we will definitely be going back because we loved the happy hour prices, tacos, appetizers, drinks and the awesome service.",

Ordered chips and salsa because we were starving and watched the table next to us get theirs... Ours came out with the meal. The food was very good, I had the California and my husband had the house burrito. Waited another 15 min for our check after we were done eating. I won't go out of my way to come back here...

    "text": "We are in town for a couple days to soak up some sunshine. Unfortunately, Diego Pops didn't really do it for us. Extremely poor service and the food isn't that great either--lets start from the beginning. Picture a slow Monday and a restaurant half empty, and the 2 of us, excited about the prospect of some great tacos. We're from Chicago so we think we r in for a real treat...We approach the hostess who says there aren't anymore seats outside. Ok, we think. We are pale, starving out-of-towners so maybe it's for the best. She brings us to our table indoors--the smallest 2 top (for 2 6ft people) in the far dark corner. As we scan the restaurant, we see booths with couples and many empty booths and table options. Whatever, we think, we won't be here for long and continue to be optimistic. 3 min later we watch as the that couple behind us in line gets sat outside...it would have been nice to get a timeframe but again, we brush it off. It takes no time at all to get drinks (water) and some chips & salsa but then the real wait begins. 30 min later our waiter never comes back to get the rest of our order. When he does, it's another 45 min for 6 tacos. When the tacos finally came, they were cold and flavorless. Pineapple relish on a pork taco? Sounds great but it's 3 pieces of fresh pineapple. Slaw? Try shredded iceberg. Thank god for the sauces but my husband had to go get them himself sThey did comp our $20 bill, so thank you for that. But honestly, if you want really delicious tacos this isn't your place. If you want some chips, salsa, & margs in a super cute spot then by all means, go. They should invest as much effort into their tacos as they do their decor.",

The restaurant does have it's own signature Mexican styled look, Which is definitely nice having something different around here.  Unfortunately that was the only thing I really enjoyed about this place. I ordered a Margarita and for the price ($11) you should expect to get fresh ingredients and a decent pour. As for someone who LOVES Margaritas this was a HUGE disappointment. The drink was so watered down it tasted like old sour mix with cheap tequila in it. And the best part was for a place that has \" True Margaritas \" you'd expect it to be in an ACTUAL Margarita glass not a rocks glass. I decided to have a quick appetizer with it, I ordered the chips and Salsa. It took over 20 minutes to get it ..  I hope my next experience can change my mind about coming here.",

My girlfriend and I decided to try a place we both hadn't been to yet for lunch on a Friday afternoon. When I got there it wasn't crowded (as it was during the week) and so since it was so nice out we decided to sit at the bar on the patio side. We asked the bartender what was the best appetizer and she recommended the Brussels Sprout Nachos. DONE! I had the Guava Coconut cocktail (served in a baby coconut) and my girlfriend just had a margarita. The nachos came out and they were huge and AWESOME with flavor. You also get a mixture of sauces as well. The pink Garlic Roasted Beet Crema was OUTSTANDING!!! We were going to try the tacos but the nachos were filling enough we decided to stop there.   Well, jump to the next day (Saturday) and while looking for a place for lunch I suggested Diego Pops to my boyfriend and our friend. After hearing about it from me the day before it was a DONE deal we were going back for lunch on Saturday!  We were served complimentary chips and salsa on this visit (why was this not consistent with all the staff...oh well). I decided to have tacos on this visit. I ordered the Braised Green Chili Chicken Taco with the suggested hard shell, Charred Skirt Steak taco with flour tortilla and a side of creamy beans. My boyfriend ordered the bean and cheese burrito (you get two in an order) and our friend ordered the Adobo BBQ Chicken Bowl. I started with my skirt steak taco and it was awesome. I then had my chicken taco and thought it fell a little flat on the flavor. I was disappointed but the skirt steak was great. The beans were also so good! My boyfriend loved his burritos and our friend loved his bowl! Again we LOVED the Garlic Beet Crema while our friend loved the Adobo sauce!   We also ordered a few drinks: my boyfriend had the margarita, I had the prickly pear margarita and our friend had the Mexican mule. We all sampled each others and they were all very tasty!   The Saturday we went the patio was full and so was the bar. The server we had on Sat seemed like he didn't really want to be there. He had a girl shadowing him for training and we saw her once time.   I know we will certainly be back again very soon as i'm already craving those nachos!!",

Their menu caters to those who like Mexican food without the unhealthy aspects of Mexican food, which, let's be honest, makes Mexican food so delicious. You won't find red rice or refried beans here. Instead, you'll find healthier twists to classics which I'm not against at all. Unique renditions of popular dishes are refreshing when it's done right, unfortunately, Diego Pops was lacking in flavor. I ordered the cod and salmon tacos with beans and rice. The only thing I finished was the cod taco on a flour tortilla (it was actually pretty good). Everything else had minimal flavor. This place was not what I was expecting and I was truly unimpressed. The service and ambience are excellent, but I don't think I'll be coming back.",

Like other reviewers have noted, I know that this place doesn't serve authentic Mexican food. But I don't care. The flavors are extremely well chosen and make for really tasty dishes where there's something for everyone. We did mostly tacos when we ate here and experienced a good variety of flavors that really made me wish we could have a Diego Pops here in San Diego. (Please? I mean, we're San DIEGO. We need a DIEGO Pops. Clearly!)  My absolutely favorite thing on the menu was the Street Corn Queso. Goodness, this stuff is like crack! I wanted more! However I'd ordered three tacos - which should be enough for most anyone - and those were fantastic, too. It seems that the wait staff is pretty good at giving their honest opinions on food and drink - our server had some great recommendations and I'm glad I took them - so don't be too quick to go all willy-nilly with your order. Listen to the wait staff and they'll guide you well.  The drinks were strong and tasty. I drank sangria and my boyfriend had a Mexican Mule and a Prickly Pear Margarita. I tried both and they were delicious.   The only thing I could possibly gripe about was that we ordered a little more towards the end of our meal and it took a little while than we would've liked. No sweat, it happens. It didn't ruin the experience.  I'll be dreaming about that Street Corn Queso and trying to make my own. Or I'll be finding a way to go back to Scottsdale for another visit. I must, must, must return.",

Brussels sprouts made to perfection. The egg was a lovely addition as well. I then had the California burrito which was very tasty. The sweet corn came through to my surprise and liking. The French fries in the burrito were fun as well. Probably not necessary but fun.   For drinks I got the Guava Coconut. It wasn't out of this world but tasty for sure. Though it was overpriced.   Going back to the Michelada. It's a spicy tomato juice and dos Equis drink (with other ingredients). It was BAD. They should really remove this item off the menu. The drink was sour and tasted of liquid vomit.",

I would go back for the food, but not my first choice. Way too slow of service. Kitchen, waitresses, and bar - all of those need some sense of urgency.

I transform into Don Draper Lite. For the uninformed, this is basically without the sexism and other reprehensible behavior, but I am down for that alcohol. What I mean is, substitute the Whiskey for their Margaritas, and I am asking for them to bring me a fresh one in the shortest, yet socially respectable intervals possible.   Diego's bring this out in a person. Situated next door to a Big & Tall Shop, Diego's is a microcosm of the positvity that exudes from the residents of Scottsdale. The staff is gregarious. They are innately in tune with the universe to not only know when to bring you that next drink, but what you want next on the menu. Hint - get the nachos, it's like they had the idea to mix the traditional dish of nachos & cheese with everything that made you love birthday parties as a kid.  Most importantly, I never break the bank going to Diego's. I could go there with $20 and make a night that could fill an entire scrapbook. Let me make sure I am getting this point across sufficiently. Ever seen Shameless (US version, the UK version wasn't relatable for some reason)? The entire Gallagher family, including Frank, could eat and drink here.   The only befuddling thing about this place - it's actually really strange - is that it is never completely packed. Personally, I believe this a sin akin to the destruction of the great library at Alexandria because this place is too good not to be packed. It's really odd. If you do you go next time though and it is packed, sorry for the jinx fam.  Needless to say, this place is lit and you need to get down there to eat and drink. When you do go though, please find this out for me. I have always been curious. Does Diego Pops sell lollipops? Make sure to report back fam.",

The taste of the food is important, and in this restaurant's case, the food was underwhelming.  We came as a group and they were able to accommodate the 6 of us easily. The misters were on, and the sun was shining. A good start to our dinner.   Service: Service was fine. The waitress came around regularly to make sure our drinks and food were okay.  Food: I ordered a California burrito with rice instead of french fries. Maybe I should've kept the fries? I don't think it would have made an improvement. The food itself was pretty gray and boring looking. They have a decent happy hour where the appetizers are half-priced. Chips and salsa aren't free, but are only $1 during HH. The guac and chips+plantain chips came out to slightly over $4. They were pretty good, not the best, but enjoyable in a group setting. We also ordered some habanero mango hot wings. Those were pretty good and came with some jicama and cucumber sticks. The veggies looked liked they'd been cut much earlier in the day and were just sitting there.  One thing that makes the restaurant unique is the array of sauces available. There are six different bottles of condiments for you to put on your food. I honestly prefer to have the chef season the meal as he deems best, but if it is kind of fun to have the option to have all these sauces. Nevertheless, the sauces I used were unable to make my meal enjoyable.   With the staggering number of other Mexican restaurants in the area, Diego Pops will not be the first one I choose when going out.",

Whoever runs this establishment should hold their wait staff accountable and set a higher standard because it's such a cool place with great food (hard working cooks! I wish my tip went to them instead) it's a shame that the people who's sole job is to just be nice can't even do that.",

We were here for happy hour and the $4 margaritas and half priced apps are such a great deal. We also love their crispy cod taco. AMAZE. Definitely make a trip to Diego Pops on your next trip to Old Town.",

I was so excited to come here with friends because I raved about it but unfortunately did not live up to what I said. First, the bartender assumed we were with the folks next to us and charged me for two margaritas instead of one. Then seemed annoyed our check was wrong. He basically blamed us for his mistake. We had to wait for a table which is not a big deal, they were busy, we understand. We were seated and then waited another 20 minutes for a drink and it was wrong. Finally we asked for our check to be split and the waitress said \"well it's already all on one check\"  she would not split the check, just very weird. I have never in my life had an issue with splitting a check.  I understand this is a busy time in Scottsdale with spring training and everything but my friends and I were super disappointed.",

These are so good, you won't want to share...but will because it's a huge portion. It's got pickled onions, brussel sprouts, and two types of cheese.   I want to come back to this place today, and I was there for lunch today. It's hipsterish, but the food was good enough for me to ignore that element.",

    "text": "Stopped by briefly for HH around 4:30 on Friday, and because we had a large party there was unfortunately no room outside and we were seated inside. I was not a fan of the atmosphere in there at that time, felt like being punished for the large party by being shoved in a dark corner. There was maybe only one or two other parties in there at that time, and it just wasn't \"fun\". (Note to self, ditch the friends next time. No True friend would come between you and tacos anyway). Otherwise the decor is cute! I have a mild obsession with pineapples so of course I immediately fell in love with the wallpaper. Service/Food: One of our party knew the waiter, so we had good service. I only stayed long enough for chips and salsa and an order of the Brussel sprout nachos, which in my opinion were mediocre - I have no idea what everyone is raving about.  Drinks: We were lucky enough to be greeted by a brand rep for Don Julio and we received two weak pitchers of margaritas for free. Beggars cant be choosers, right? So, I will not say anything more about how watered down they were and how she just gave us a stack of not-very-clean cups for us to pass around/pour ourselves. One of our party did order the sangria from the bar and it was awful. She finished it but said it tasted like soap? Parking: even at 4:30 the parking lot was already packed and the valet was starting to block off opened spots. I had to circle around and park across the street behind the restaurant. Not a huge deal but a slight frustration. But I guess that's Old Town for you. I would like to come back again, maybe sit outside, try more of the menu and drinks. I've heard really good things and had much higher hopes. It did seem to have potential, so I will chock this up to a one-off occurrence. Looking forward to being able to update my review next time.",

Margs are equally as great as their tacos and burrito bowls :)",

We both wanted a margarita & the waitress suggested a pitcher of the house marg which we later calculated to be the better deal (one glass = $7 ; we got 2.5 glasses EACH out of the pitcher and it was only $24 -- saved $11!!). The margarita was delicious! Then my boyfriend got 2 charred skirt steak tacos & I got one skirt steak & one crispy cod. They were SO good. I would DEFINITLY come back.",

The salsa was terrible and very hot. When we asked for less spicy they brought over some tubes filled with different colored mayo products...it was so gross. Then the tacos came out and all the meat was burned and tasted old. The drinks were okay but not anything special. The snowcone had very little alcohol in it and even the waitress was surprised at how little effort they put into it. The de ore was old and the walls echoed terribly so we had to scream to hear one another. This may be a fun hang out bar but definitely do not come here for the food. Service was great which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.",

Diego Pops takes my mind straight to Palm Springs, they have a very colorful, mid-century and modern decor with spunky signs. My favorite part is their outdoor bar area. It is beautiful and it let's you enjoy their ambience while also spending time outdoor in the warm Scottsdale sunshine.   FOOD: Let's talk about what we are really here for!  Unlike most Mexican restaurants, they have TACO MONDAY! Wooho. $3 tacos. Even salmon, shrimp and steak.   We ordered almost every flavor and they were all delicious.   I also ordered the Steak Skirt Bowl, very good but a little bland. However, they do offer a variety of 6 house specialty sauces that are AMAZING. Amongs them they have cilantro, chipotle, beets, and habanero sauce. I definetly recomend trying them all.   DRINKS: YUMM!  We ordered the watermelon margaritas, I really enjoy the settled taste of watermelon and the fact that it was not very sweet. Very refreshing . 10/10 recommend",

    "text": "In Phoenix/Scottsdale, there is NO shortage of taco shops and mexican food establishments.  So when a friend and I were walking around old town and deciding on a place for lunch, I was excited to come across Diego Pops.  We walked in and my first impression was great.  There's a \"last supper\" picture behind the front desk with Jesus in the center but this particular Jesus is a DJ with his turntable setup on the table.  I'm smiling cause I always suspected that \"Jesus is a DJ\" and tell the host I'd like a table for two.  That's it.  From that point forward, we were a nuisance as customers--or at least that's how we felt.    I was told it would take just a bit but they would find us a table.  I saw the host talking with a server and they're apparently strategizing on a place to seat us as the place was filling up quickly.  They hemmed and hawed with each other and I suppose they decided on a plan to get us seated.  The hostess tells us she's working on it and that they'll be able to seat us shorty.  I get it.  When it gets busy, you have to improvise seating to maximize space to serve all customers.  So we waited.  Finally, they set up the table and they sat us down. I was seated with my back to a glassed door and my friend was in front of me with the sun in her eyes.  We decided that no matter if I switched places with her, one of us would end up with the sun in our eyes.  So we took it upon ourselves to move our seats on this small square table so that the sun was on the sides of both our faces and we were still able to face each other and more importantly, see each other.   The waitress came to take our drink order and left.  Shortly after she left, another employee came to our table to tell us we could not sit in the position we had chosen.  We explained the 'sun in the face' issue but she said he needed us to move back to the other seating arrangement they had set up for us.  When I asked how it made a difference, she said to us that our sitting in the position/setup we had chosen was encroaching on the people seated behind us.  Now mind you, had that been True, I would have acquiesced and asked to be reseated once something else became available.  But that wasn't the case.   I explained that there was plenty of space for the next table's patrons to easily get in and out but she argued with me and said there was not.  I told her she was being unreasonable and she said, \"I dont know what you want me to do.  I'm trying to accommodate all our customers.\"  Nice try but, in my opinion, she was more concerned about exerting her need to be right and have things her way.  IF she were really concerned about all patrons, she would have asked if she could reseat us somewhere else where the sun wouldnt be in our eyes.  But she couldn't because as she re-fed me the line about 'only trying to accommodate all customers,' she said that...as she was walking away!  Needless to say, we left.    Like I said, there are so many taco shops in the city that it's not worth arguing with an obstinate server.  When we left, she saw us walking out and she shook her head.  She didnt come over and say she was sorry we weren't comfortable there and maybe she could reseat us.  Nothing.  She proved her concern about accommodating all customers was only lip service.    Save yourself the time and walk over to Barrio Queen just down the street.  That's what we did.  And we had a great lunch!",

Ordered the coconut rice and the only coconut taste was the little tiny flakes they placed on top. The rice was over cooked (soggy). It was so loud at 11am that could barely here the server. The menus had dried up sugar or alcohol on it. It was sticky. I also ordered the skirt steak and shrimp taco and I wanted it to be amazing and it wasn't. The shrimp taco lacked so much flavor and you get so little amount in the street taco, for $5 - $7 a taco, I would absolutely love to expect more. Our server was slow, didn't get utensils until I went up to the bar to grab some bar napkins. Didnt get our chips and salads until 20 mins after ordering. After I watched 3 guys sit down immediately at the bar and within 5 mins of them sitting down they were handed chips and salsa. Took another 30 mins for 4 tacos (between I and my husband) to get. Had to ask for a refill on water. It's those little things that customers should not have to worry about. It's serving 101.  So disappointed as I have been wanting to make a trip here for so long. Now I have and not really worth coming back. Have had way better service and tacos at other places.",

I rolled the dice on the Horchata and was equally satisfied.    Got the bowl w/pastor and pineapple.  Picked the cilantro rice w/black beans.  It was like a Gourmet Chipotle bowl I would have paid $5 more than the $10 menu price.  Except it was served by people who you would want to go out drinking with.    We'll be back.",

We asked for the ceviche to come out first. We waited 25 mins for the ceviche and I asked our server to check on it and she promised she was on top of it. Another while goes by and finally we get all our food at once which apparently the manager ran out. We asked the manager for sauce so we could eat. She never came back with our sauce so we sat another while and I had to get up to ask a different server for some sauce. At this point, I asked to speak with the manager again. When she came back, she did apologize and blamed the kitchen saying she yelled at them many times. Then I asked her to please take the ceviche away, that at this point we would just eat our tacos. Her response? \"Sorry, can I buy you tequila shots?\" I understand this is Scottsdale and this is a nice gesture but after turning them down, I dunno, I feel that if she offered to buy us shots, the least she could have done was comp my lemonade and my husbands horchata. The only thing that was fixed was the ceviche that we didn't even eat was taken off the bill. Wow! Thanks!  The manager was nice enough but young and I think uninformed.",

I didn't get any photos, but the menu has a wide array of choices, and they are super accommodating to special orders! Our waitress was being trained and was absolutely awesome! So in total we had 3 people looking after us. We had a group of about 10 guys, and Emily, Taylor, and the manager who also came over ALEXYS, were PHENOMENAL!!  The tacos came out quickly, were super juicy with great sauce and cooked to perfection. The margaritas were tasty and we had ALOT! They had a check in special so I got a special taco and a beer as well!   Bottom line with this place, you will have a GREAT time! When the manager ends up befriending the entire group and she takes extra care of your group just because that's her nature, you know the place is run well! I have 0 complaints so 5 stars ALL DAY!!

We ordered 5 different types of tacos and non of them blew us away.  They all had way too little meat and way too much lettuce/slaw on top. I felt like I was eating a taco salad to be honest.  The real reason we came here was to try the hyped up sundaes for dessert.  Unfortunately when it was time to order dessert we were informed that the ice cream machine has been broken for a month.  SERIOUSLY?!  The food and drinks were ok but not worth returning for.  It was the dessert we really wanted to try and they didn't even have a working ice cream machine. Super disappointed.  With all the other amazing restaurants in the downtown Scottsdale area don't waste your time coming here.",

I also order the street corn queso and the prickly pear margarita which were both good. I think this place is just hype but taste wise it's nothing special or anything to get excited about. I do think they have very cute decor which I believe is what attracts most people. Overall I wouldn't recommend the food and the drinks are pretty average.",

The pickled onions and the cojita with the crispy Brussels sprouts are excellent. The drinks are very good too, and they can make you a \"skinny\" version of a house marg. I tried the tacos the second time I came and was not disappointed. The snow cone margaritas are super yummy but the tiny spoon it comes with is laughable. We love coming here and bringing friends here because it's casual but trendy and reasonably priced for a fun dinner in OTS.",

There guac is very tasty freshly made, and get fresh jalapeno's on the side.  There plantain's are very tasty super flavorful I recommend the bowl for sure.   Drinks- they have margaritas, beer to your choice and there margaritas are greatly made and add it with a sugar rim.   Happy hour- Monday-friday 3pm-6pm. Sunday happy hour is all day.

We've been here multiple times and the food is always very good. We love getting tacos, chips and salsa and the corn appetizer. Tip: Ask for the corn in a bowl off of the cob so that way you can dip your chips on it. It's soooo good with the hot cheetos dusted on top.   Go for happy hour during the week or on Mondays when they have super good deals.",

Thankfully for us we had caught diego pops at a happy hour and taco Monday. My first problem was the elote. Our waitress had said that the corn would be a minute to cook which we had no problem with waiting, but to me that means when it arrives it should be hot, but it was not it was lukewarm. Then when we got our tacos, one of my crunchy shells was a bit burnt. The soft taco shells were also not very warm at all and every taco needed loads of salsa because it was lacking in flavor. I was so happy that we did not have to pay full price because these tacos were not worth $5. I have had so many tacos they are my favorite food, so I know a good taco when I have it.  I just wouldn't really come back here to eat again. The staff was friendly, the ambiance was cute, but the heart of any restaurant (the food) was lacking.",

I love the patio but the inside decor is adorable as well, with it's funky pink pineapple wall paper and bright neon signs!  I came in recently with some coworkers for a team happy hour! We started with some drinks and apps. They had happy hour specials going on so I enjoyed a $4 house margarita and all of our apps were half off! It was a pretty great deal! We order the chips and salsa, guacamole, street corn queso, the quesadilla, and the brussel sprout nachos. The stand out was definitely the nachos! Who would ever think to put brussel sprouts on nachos?! I also loved the pickled onions and jalapenos that were on the nachos! I have to say though, I'm not much of a fan of their beet crema sauce that was on both the nachos and the quesadilla.   Be warned, when it comes to Diego Pops' cocktails, some of them are just for the looks. They are adorable in photos but do not tasty very good. I tried the guava coconut cocktail, which is beautiful. It's in a baby coconut with an umbrella, but the flavor of the drink was way too sweet. And the snow cone margaritas are also not worth ordering. Luckily, the servers are very up front about this and steer guest towards better choices, like the prickly pear or watermelon mint margaritas! Both are unique and refreshing!",

Their patio is dog friendly which was great for us. Their tacos are all gluten-free if you get them on a soft corn tortilla. I have to stay away from their chips because of fryer cross-contamination as I'm Celiac.  We got guacamole to start and was just so-so.  I got pineapple pork tacos and green chili pork tacos. They were both good but the pineapple pork tacos I definitely recommend. My wife got the chicken adobo taco and the watermelon salad. She like both but the taco was only good after dr'ing it up with pickled onions and Serrano sauce.  She was very happy with the watermelon salad.  This is one of our favorite local taco places and we'll definitely be back!",

The inside of the restaurant is very cute with kind of a retro vibe. We started off with the chips & guac and started to dig in...until about 10 flies started swarming our table. It was actually very gross. We felt like we were shooing off a fly every 10 seconds. The guac was served with tortilla chips and plantain chips (which I did not care for). We each had a fish taco and a pulled pork taco. Both of the tacos were flavorful, but we were so grossed out by the flies swarming around us and our food that we left quicker than expected and not finishing everything before we left. They need to get that fly situation under control.",

So much flavor in it and it all balances out well. The second one I tried was the charred skirt steak. The steak was great but everything else was bland. The third one was the grilled shrimp. It wasn't very good I wouldn't recommend ordering it.  Even though I only really liked 1 of the 3 tacos I ordered I really enjoyed my experience here.

I've tried various types here and all of them have been delicious.  The atmosphere is great and you can sit inside or outside. Service was fast and attentive and our food was out in no time! I can definitely see this being a regular place to go and it would also be a great place to start, or end, and evening out in Scottsdale.",

With that high priced I expect a flavorful dish. Excited to get the grilled salmon taco. The salmon tasted like it came from a can . ordered pitcher of margarita . it was 60% water 35% juice 5% alcohol for $35. Prolly never coming back. Maybe it it was like $2 a taco. Service was good nothing outstanding .I like how they have a variety of sauces on the table.",

I never got a water refill in 1.5 hours! I ordered chips/guac (received 25 minutes after the 1st time we ordered). We received crumbled chips after the long wait. I had to get up and ask for napkins?!other tables didn't have napkins while they were eating their meals? They had servers rolling silverware in the main dining room, right next/above a guest's table?! They ended up complaining and requesting to move. It was noisy and distracting even for sitting near by. In almost 1.5 hours I was only able to order 3 drinks between 2 ppl, which I waited nearly 20 minutes for my last drink (after following up) to be told they didn't have the coconut to put my drink in. I was offered the drink in a regular glass, which would have been fine...if I was offered when I first put the order in. I dine out a lot and this was by far the worst experience I've had in a long time. We walked to a near by establishment and received 2 speciality cocktails and a hot appetizer within the first 10 minutes!!!",

Parking is a little small so if you're planning on drinking, just Uber there so you don't have to worry about parking. If you do drive, there's a big parking stricture about 1-2 blocks away, so it's not too bad anyways.",

The GM stopped by who also could not be any more friendly.   After stuffing my face full I couldn't say no to dessert... \"camp fire sundae\" changed my life... Ice cream, chocolate sauce, graham cracker and toasted marshmallow cream over top... they literally toast it with a torch!! Highly recommend.

Anyway, I guess that's a reason to return sooner rather than later. Diego Pops was a fun little restaurant with excellent service. A friend and I went around 9:30 at night, and they were semi busy, but not crazy. We ordered the chips and salsas.... the salsas were all delish. It was fun to eat the chips with the 4 or 5 different salsas. We also tried 4 different tacos, and all were tasty with the fried fish being the most  underwhelming and the pineapple pork and machaca being the tastiest. All were fairly good and large! The one drink we tried was the guava coconut because....well... it's served in a coconut!!! The drink itself was just ok, but it added to the experience.

The last time (this past spring) we sat outside at the bar and the staff seemed more interested in socializing with each other than taking care of customers.  I had taken someone new there and was a little embarrassed that I recommended it for dinner that night.",

We got seated right away, I would of preferred the patio, but since it was Valentines Day I was happy we got seated at all without a wait. Our cute and bubbly comes in to greet us and we immediately ask to order the guacamole and she apologizes and says they are out and she should mention they're also out of flour tortillas?! Um, what? Mexican restaurant that doesn't have guac... you would think that would be simple to remake. But, of course maybe they didn't think they'd as busy this weekend being Valentines day and all.   The great thing is they have happy hour all day on Sundays and the drinks were amazing and delicious and pretty and anything else you can think of. The food on the other hand was nothing spectacular. I will definitely be back to give them another try when they might be more prepared and not so busy. The place was too cute and I've heard too many great things to not try them out again.",

    "text": "Never again - I live in Scottsdale and have been to Diego Pops 6 times now. The first 3 times made us want to come back. Good service, good tacos, and a unique take on a mexican staple in a metro area that offers a wide variety of them. However, the 4th time was different. The servers did there job but the host was a dick and the pork and machaca meat in the tacos as well as the crispy shells were way over cooked.  Ditto the 5th time except instead of the host it was the butch bartender that seemed to hate every minute she was there and took it out on the customers.  This last Wednesday night was our 6th and last time at Diego Pops. We were celebrating a birthday with a party of 6. After a healthy bar tab we were ready to find a table and eat but the hostess seemed to be completely confused and incapable of figuring out how to seat 6 people together and she just lost it. We didn't care where we sat we just wanted to sit down and celebrate. When were were finally seated and the food came we were disappointed again. Burnt meat stuffed in burnt crispy taco shells.  I can get better tacos at Filibertos drive thru for 1/3 the price with a lot less bitchy attitude. Diego Pops has forgotten who pays the bills and that its the food that is key to repeat business from locals not the \"Old Town\" location so we are done with Diego Pops. I would recommend you try Blanco Taco, Bario Queen, Joy Ride, or Fuzzys, or Juan Jaimes for good tacos and proper hospitality. Thanks Yelp.",

I'm better off eating at home. The food was okay. My water, drinks, appetizer, entre show up at the same time. As everything  is being served at once my waiter spills my margarita on my pants and sandal. Says sorry, runs away never to be seen again. Luckily anther server was near by to get a napkin to wipe myself off. Seriously. I complained maybe thinking the manager would come by, but only to hear the server is busy. Never going back, that's for sure. If my waiter was so busy the manager should be helping making sure everything runs smoothly. I'm sure the manager was standing there with his thumb up his ass.",

If it's your first time, you have to try the brussels sprout nachos.  If you don't like brussels sprouts... get them anyways.  The brussels sprouts are really buttery and compliment the cheese and egg.  It has some great flavors and textures... it's very unique to Diego Pops!  The cocktails are all pretty decent but if you're looking for a nonalcoholic beverage, I love the limeade aqua fresca.  It's really refreshing especially during the scorching hot summer days (and nights).  I usually either get the grilled shrimp tacos (delicious) or I go for the mango habanero wings.  The wings take a bit so definitely plan accordingly but I think that they're worth the extra time.  No matter what I'm eating, I always have the beet crema (the pink sauce) on hand.  I don't know exactly what's in it but if they sold it, I would buy gallons at a time.  The service is definitely spotty but that doesn't necessarily bother me because I really enjoy the food.",

Well first of all, they gave us food so that is a 1 star,  then they have a decorated restaurant so there goes 1 more. It wasn't bad experience though it was just bad food. It had music it had people just not enough staff. Now let's talk about the food. First things first. The appetizer which was chips and salsa. Can't go wrong with that right? Well this is what I learned, you can go wrong with that. Salsa was bland and chips had no flavor whatsoever. Then the food , only thing that my family liked about that was the cholula. Terrible. No flavor. I recommend that you do not go to this restaurant if you don't like things with no flavor!",

The decor is trendy but comfortable and the staff was immediately inviting and welcoming.  The menu all looked amazing so the owner gave us some good pointers... Some of which were their award winners! We tried the guacamole which was great, the chips were really good too and the salsa was fresh and homemade. The wings were Deeelish! The grill was a great touch.  They were a little bit sweet with heat at the back which was perfect. The shrimp tacos were the BOMB! Going back just for those for sure!

I had two tacos, cod and skirt steak, with rice and beans. The tacos were soooo good. Everything from the meat, the toppings, and the sauces were amazing. My only complaint would be that the rice tasted like the precooked frozen rice from Trader Joes, I would have preferred spanish rice, but that is very minor. They have a great happy hour and great drinks as well. I would highly recommend, and undoubtedly next time I am in Scottsdale I will be coming back!",

Chia lemonade could use more chia seeds.   Watermelon + Cotija salad is refreshing, and can be easily paired with any of their tacos. Tho their Braised Pineapple Pork indicates crispy tortilla, I preferred it on flour; unless you're eating it as soon as it comes out, it gets much too hard. Then you can drown it in sauce.   Take advantage of their 6-pack of sauces- Roasted Garlic Beat Crema was my fave.   Minus a star because their dessert was a bust.  Choco taco was store bought but priced as if  handmade. I can get this from the ice cream man and at half the price.  Hand dipped cone isn't dipped at all. The hardening chocolate sauce is drizzled over the ice cream. Churro sundae was more ice cream than churro; and the churro spears were more like pretzels after you dug it out.",

Out the door for $20 plus tip. Food was very good, but again, the staff was truly exceptional. Friendly and helpful without being overbearing.

They open at 11 and on a weekday, the restaurant filled up quick.   I had:  Brussels sprouts nachos: with red chili, eggs, pickled onions. Huge. Enough for four. Very tasty. We did remove most of the red Chile slices since they were spicy.   Chips and salsa $2. The salsa was spicy. It was a good serving   6 different salsas. Either mild or not spicy at all, but Delicious.  My favorite was the roasted garlic beet cream. It really evened out anything super spicy.   Plantains: yummy and big. I don't think anyone can mess up plantains   Best of all, you get a $5 taco and beer with your  yelp check In.   We all also enjoyed the complimentary gum",

    "text": "We were visiting Arizona for a sports event and decided to try our Diego Pops.  The place is very modern and hip, the hostesses are nice and so are the servers; they did their best with a large group of nearly 20.  I know I can't expect all 20'of us to eat at the same time but waiting nearly 25mins between the first round of people served to the next was a little ridiculous.  But it was the kindness of our server (I didn't catch his name) that saved this review from being a 1-star review.  The food itself was good if you're looking for mexican food a step above Chipotle, but just ehh if you want actual Mexican food.  I order the chicken bowl and others ordered burritos, ceviche, and tacos.  The bowl was rook temp when it was served to me and basically soupy with all the liquid from the black beans that was not drained.    Here's the part that killed the whole experience: They have a semi-open kitchen and my friend was facing said kitchen.  We had already been waiting awhile for our food so naturally we looking toward the kitchen to see what was coming out next.  She saw her husbands ceviche in the pick up window with a tray of chips...then she saw a server take a chip off of the tray and eat it before coming to drop it off to the table. As to not cause a scene, she kindly asked for a new tray of chips and the servers response was \"they're all the same.\"  Since the server did not want to get new chips, she called her out on eating the chip off the tray.  Turns out this server was the floor manager! She took the chips and had someone else bring us the new ones. She then proceeded to not run food to our tables even when half of the party was done eating and the others hadn't gotten their food yet.  It's a nice place for drinks but I cannot say that I will be back or that I will recommend Diego Pops to anyone",

If your a hardcore taco purist who likes more authentic tacos this place might not be for you.

I love how the menu is set up and that they suggest the best tortilla for each meat.  My favorite is the the Charred Skirt Steak taco with the Braised Pineapple Pork being a close second. I love that you get a selection of sauces brought to your table so you can customize each taco if you'd like. The coconut rice is also very nice, light and creamy, great way to break up spicy if you ordered spicy.  Chips and Salsa are always a must have!  I can't wait to go back to try some of the cocktails and possibly the soft serve, I'm a sucker for unique soft serve flavors!",

    "text": "Since there was a wait due to the popularity of Diego Pops, we killed some time by ordering a drink at the bar. I really liked the variety of drinks on their drink menu. The \"Mexican Mule\" caught my attention because I would normally drink a closely tasting incarnation such as either a Kentucky or Moscow Mule. The Mexican Mule has 1800 reposado, muddled cucumber, agave, ginger beer, and their house made sweet and sour. It was pretty good and refreshing, especially on a hot Arizona night.   Speaking of hot Arizona nights, the cute waitresses were noticeably wearing short shorts which is appropriate for the outdoor weather as the restaurant was essentially outdoors with its open patio doors.  My friend recommended that I try some of their tacos and the varying salsas. The variety of tacos reminded me of good taco places in Mexico. I ordered the charred skirt steak, the grilled cod, and the brussels sprouts taco. The steak and the brussels sprouts were pretty good, but the grilled cod wasn't my favorite. It tasted as though someone boiled the cod and forgot to season it. I also gravitated towards the green salsa, one of the many choices of salsas at my table.",

My two corn records were plantains and shirt steak. The crispy slaw blended nicely with the plantains giving a fresh, crunchy taste. Really liked the skirt steak taco. Did not enjoy the green tea. The taste was subtle, more like a flavored water. Loved the new churro dessert with three dipping sauces. Being an out of towner I enjoyed the vibe and people watching. Steve the general manager stopped over when I was leaving. Was interested to hear about my dining experience. Super nice guy.",

    "text": "I ate at a ton of restaurants during my long weekend in Scottsdale, but am scrambling to review Diego Pops first because of how amazing it was!!  I could keep this review short and sweet and really just say: Brussels sprouts nachos. Yup, Brussels Sprouts nachos exist and you can find them at Diego pops. The nachos are smothered in a creamy cheese sauce and topped with corn, lots of fresh Brussels, pickled onions and peppers, beet crema and a fried egg. By far the best nachos I've ever had. Is it weird to travel cross country again for nachos? I'd do it. Don't judge me.   The portion is pretty large. Two of us split and we honestly could have called it quits after. But there were also tacos to be had. They offer single tacos for 4-5 dollars, and they aren't too large. It's the perfect addition to a meal if you want to try just one. I went with the carne asada taco which had juicy steak and was topped with cabbage and pico. There is a caddy of 6 dipping sauces at each table, and the avocado ranch was absolute perfection on the taco.  Service was stellar, cocktails were strong and refreshing and the patio seating was plentiful. If you can't get a patio seat do not be upset. The interior is chic and trendy. Think pineapple wall paper, neon signage and lots of hanging string lights + plants. You could take a new profile picture here.   Pro-tip: check in on Yelp for a 5 dollar taco + beer combo. Most tacos are 5 anyway, so this basically means a free beer.",

Our waitress was slow and when we ordered the chips and gauc there was an old piece of avocado mixed into the mess of plantains and chips. The tacos came out 2 mins after we ordered them which I would normally be thrilled about.. but it showed in the presentation and ultimately the taste.   The shrimp taco was basically just that, shrimp and a spoonful of what they call \"corn salsa\" which is pretty much sweet white corn out of a tin-can. The machaca beef taco came out with one chunk of beef that I shredded myself with my fork(annoying) and that corn mess again.   This all might be excusable if this meal had been cheap- It is not. Would never return.. this place has a lot of work to do.",

Food is awesome don't get me wrong, but first impressions coming into the door were very upsetting. I came in wanting to get a table for a party of 5 being the first to arrive, and the host said I couldn't sit down until the rest of my party arrived. Not sure if it had to do with the fact that they don't take reservations or not...  Our server is why I'm writing this review. I told her it was a birthday celebration. She didn't smile very much and kind of had a attitude, felt like we were being rushed to eat our meal and finish our drinks. Dropped the check without asking if we want split checks or not while we weren't half way finished with our drinks. Like I said, come here if you want a awesome meal, but the service is hit or miss apparently.",

I came late, around 9:30 on a weekend night, and sat down with a friend who was already there. I didn't even see our waitress for fifteen minutes, but luckily the manager came by to drop off my friends drink and took my order. I also had to order my food with the drink runner because the waitress was MIA. But that's not what annoyed me, what really got me was that after we got our food, our waitress came literally every 5 to 10 minutes asking \"you ladies doing alright?\". Yes, yes we are. Just like we were 5 minutes ago. She came about ten times in a 45 minute period, and it made me mad honestly. I am having a conversation with my friend and am constantly being interrupted by this girl. It was rude and it made us feel rushed, even though the restaurant wasn't full and plenty of people had come in after us to eat so it's not like we were the last ones. I will say the only reason that I didn't give this place one stars was because I thought the manager (female, brunette) was being attentive and involved just the right amount with all the tables. The food was mediocre, the Brussel sprout nachos were good but the guac had way, way too much lime in it, it was inedible. Good luck diego pops, but I won't be back.",

I recommend trying any of their tacos, they are all delicious! My favorites are the skirt steak and the salmon.",

    "text": "[Never finished this review from Feb, so here goes] Oh dear... This place needs help.  A group of 14 hungry girls came here for dinner last Feb.  We were so excited for all things Mexican and this is (honestly) a very cute restaurant in a great location.  We sat down and immediately tried to order pitchers of margaritas and guacamole (duh!).  The waiter decided that this might be a good time to inform us that they were out of guacamole.  Strike one.  He also informed us that they were out of flour tortillas - how is that even possible?? Strike two.  After blank stares and conversation among our group we decided that we could salvage our Mexican night with queso and brussel sprout nachos.  5 minutes later the waiter came back (noticeably without our margaritas) and we asked for several orders of the above mentioned cheesy deliciousness.  He then told us that they ran out of cheese, so both the nachos and queso were not in our future.  This may be a good time to mention that the menu here is pretty limited (tacos, ceviche, avocado-y greatness and cheesy items), so this was very upsetting news.  Our waiter didn't seemed too fazed with the fact that they had run out of 90% of the menu, which maybe means it happens often (unclear)? After some back and forth with our waiter friend, we landed at the following: four pitchers of margaritas (but... surprise, they were out of some of them) and vouchers for free tacos to use at a later date and time (unfortunately, 13 of the 14 were visiting from out of town and had no plans to return...).  All in all, our dining experience here was not filling (literally), but the restaurant has a cool vibe, so perhaps they have been able to figure out that they need to actually have food to serve.",

They have about 6 different sauces you can add to your tacos, but the tacos are so flavorful that I didn't need any sauces. I think the steak taco is the best. It was tender and they put avocado in it. Yum! The green chili chicken and adobo chicken were also wonderful. I asked the very friendly bartender if I should get corn or flour tortillas, and she suggested the flour. I'm so glad I listened. They were the best flour tortillas I've had. Chips and salsa were amazing too! I can't wait to come back here and try their other stuff.",

But like every other place in Old Town the quality of the food and service falls off. Our waitress got every single one of our orders wrong, forget two of our orders, the sangria was bland and warm, we had charged skirt steak bowl and plate, both weren't really edible. The meat was overcooked and dry, the brown rice was burnt and hard. Our other friend ordered the green chili chicken plate, he barely had two bites. The tuna poke was lacking tuna, think about a bowl of poorly prepared stale coconut rice and some greens, with the tuna playing hide and seek. The waitress told us they only had hot sauce available, which is False having dined there before I knew for a fact there is a bunch of homemade sauces, but towards the end of our meal she showed up with all the sauces. An overall terrible experience for all of for of us and a waste of $150. Maybe the waitresses should write down orders so they don't have to be reminded everyone is missing something and from the taste of the food they either need a new chef or someone who can cook for humans because my dogs wouldn't eat what was served to us. Thank god for AMEX, a simple call to them will make this dining experience disappear cost wise. Taco Bell is a 5 star restaurant versus this place, service and food quality wise.",

    "text": "I'm really happy that Diego Pops opened recently. I live in the area and have been looking for a Mexican restaurant that is nicer than fast food drive-thrus, but not as upscale as The Mission. Diego Pops is in a great location in Old Town and I'm really impressed with the way they've designed the restaurant. The decor is fresh and fun - everything is colorful and the place feels tropical. Parking out front is very limited, so save yourself the trouble of their tiny lot and go park behind the building.   The food deserves five stars, without a doubt. I usually order two or three tacos depending how hungry I am, and whether or not we get guacamole. (Order the guac!) They serve you chips and salsa, which aren't terrible but nothing spectacular. I like that they give you a basket with a variety of sauces (chipotle, avocado puree, salsa verde, spicy red salsa, and others), but everytime I've gone the bottles have been low. How often are they refilled... and are the sauces fresh?  My favorite tacos are the steak, pineapple pork, and grilled shrimp. Go with the recommended tortilla on each one. Maybe order two pineapple pork tacos, because they really are delicious! Sometimes I'll get fried plantains as dessert. If you've never tried them, I would suggest ordering them next time you go!  The only downside to this restaurant is the service. I've been five or six times in the last few months and some days are worse than others. The staff is nice but not very attentive... sometimes I will literally have to flag someone down to get a water refill, a napkin, or even silverware! It's frustrating because all of those things are components of good, even mediocre, restaurant service. I hope the management decides to put more emphasis on good service - it's really the only thing lacking from a great restaurant.",

The wings were good from a standpoint of meaty and juicy but they had absolutely no flavor. Obviously, we eat there for the tacos but I was expecting this to be a good speciality from Diego Pops but felt I could have received the same wings from Zips.",

I came here for lunch on a recent business trip to Scottsdale. It came highly recommended by locals and Yelpers alike. After sitting down in their sunny, inviting patio, I could immediately see why. This place looks like an all-day fiesta. Hoppin' bar; friendly servers; cold beers; fresh guacamole; young, attractive patrons. Who could ask for anything more?!  Our table feasted on their famous Brussels Sprouts nachos; Street Corn Queso; and guacamole and chips. For our entree, you can choose from a variety of tacos featuring fresh ingredients and meat/chicken/fish hot off the grill. This place ain't no Taco Bell. It's the real deal. I wound up ordering the Braised Green Chili Chicken Taco which comes with crema, cotija, house slaw on a crispy corn tortilla. I could've eaten 10 of them!  BTW, if you check in on Yelp you can take advantage of a $5 taco/beer special.   If you're in the Scottsdale area, I'd highly recommend this spot for an outdoor lunch or happy hour!",

    "text": "I enjoyed the atmosphere at Diego Pops more than I enjoyed my lackluster corn & avocado salad for lunch. But that sunny, vacation-like ambiance truly did make up for everything. It's like a hipster beach hut in the middle of Scottsdale - so chill  and festive with neon colors and desert plants. I wish this were my backyard.   So, now that you know how cool the vibe is, be careful with your food order. Salads over-promised and under-delivered. But the tacos looked solid, and the ice tea options were exotic. Those \"famous\" brussel sprout nachos though? Also False advertisement. They were basically normal nachos with a few brussel sprout leaves sprinkled on top. Not very exciting.   They do have a sweet Yelp check-in offer: $5 for a taco & a beer. And service was fabulous, fast & friendly. Order wisely and you'll have a lovely time at Diego Pops.",

Other than that the patio was legit.  Service was good. Food was even better. Taco Monday?! Who knew this was a thing. Diego Pops originators of the taco Monday kick though! We ordered 1 of each their 7 tacos featured (plenty more to select from) these were the $2 or $3 deal. Favorite was the cod, salmon, green chili chicken.   They have a killer selection of sauces/salsas they bring out too which only adds to your dish! Chips and salsa were on point, salsa was chunky and had a good kick.  Best part... CHOCO TACO!  definitely a spot to go check out.",

It's hard when you walk into Mexican restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale because immediately you think you're going to get some \"touristy\" food and experience. Let's just say I was somewhat surprised when Diego Pops exceeded my expectations.   The actual \"space\"of the place is amazing. A huge patio with plenty of Arizona sun, and a bar stocked full of great tequila. Well done. Our server was a super nice guy (probably an ASU student), and gave us great recommendations on the tacos. I ended up ordering the braised chicken, steak and pork (one of each) and I was very impressed. The best part...the tortilla. It was a flour tortilla done proper, so big ups.   The check in offer was a taco and a beer for $5, so I naturally ordered that and tacked on the other two tacos. What a great deal, so don't skip on the check in. The others I dined with that day said the salad was a little bland but, fine none the less. Moral of the story, get the tacos.",

    "text": "Honestly the food sucks. I'm full Mexican and the only good thing I ordered was the chips and salsa. The margarita was good and the service was awesome but truly the food wow I can't believe how disappointed I was. Brown or coconut rice? Why is red rice not an option. This is totally white washed \"Mexican\" street tacos. I was so disappointed for the beans and rice coming in one ounce plastic containers. Not even street tacos on the food trucks do that. Won't come back. Total rip off. The bartender was killing it though! She rocked but my food totally sucked. 4 dollars for a vegetarian taco of \"plantain\" but just contained beans, corn, gross onion and cabbage. The food had no flavor and the taco was bland and not worth $4. I would rather hit up the dollar store and buy a can of beans for a dollar lol. Sad to say but so True. Disappointed in the food because it looked so poppin at this place. I had even pulled over. This isn't what real tacos are. Just get a drink and be about your day. This place sucks I won't come back. The servers looked unhappy and when the guy dropped off my food he looked annoyed when I said thank you I appreciate you. I had to ask for a straw after 15 mins of tryin to get anyone's attention. That's uncalled for. Don't be cheap or try to save the animals. If you wanna Save the animals than just do not consume animal product. Real animal lovers don't eat animals, period. Just give the damn straws out. It's Scottsdale why would you not give straws to the people automatically. The recipes are horrible. I've never been so disappointed in a taco. I went to La Fonda on Shea Blvd and had a way better food and experience. I just like can't believe how much the food sucked. My mind is blown at how terrible it was. I hardly ate or finished it cause it sucked so bad. Not made with love at all. You can taste it: everyone there hates their job. You can see it. I've been in the restaurant industry for 10 years. I would know. This was a very disappointing place to eat. The food sucked so bad I wish I could give this zero reviews. The bartender was very sweet though. She was very busy and slaying the bartender game. She deserves a better place to work.",

The corn on the tacos was clearly canned corn and watery. The tortillas were either warm at one point or just stale because they were cold and unappetizingly crusty. It was as if the tacos were pre-made and left to sit out until they were ordered. What is going on here? The atmosphere was nice and the service was average, nothing to write home about that's for sure. If you want some real tacos that are warm, FRESH, and delicious with a great atmosphere and excellent service, I suggest Barrio Queen or my personal favorite, Crujiente.",

We saw our waitress 3 times while we were there for an hour so we'd be sitting forever to ask for something.  Our mango habanero wings came out with NO sauce on it, they were just fried wings. And the dressing that was supposed to come with it didn't. The waitress brought the food back but it still wasn't great and we were still charged for their mistake.  The tacos were average, I've definitely had better in old town. The shrim Taco was the only one I liked. However the Mexican mule was a highlight in a rather dismal putting where there was poor service and , below average food.",

The brussel sprout nachos were a surprising burst of flavor with the pickled onion and egg on top. I will be dreaming about them for days.  Our table tried each of the tacos and were pleased with the flavor and tenderness of the meat. The chicken tortilla soup didn't disappoint the heaping serving had large chunks of chicken and freshly cubed avocado. My husband the finicky eater ordered the Sonoran Hot Dog. It was high beef hot dog wrapped in Texas toast and he loved every bite of it. The mango habanero wings were also a win.  Save your money and don't get the beans and rice they were lack luster and a bit bland. Our only complaint was our server was a bit slow on drinks and we had to keep getting up to order more. As a tequila snob I was pleased with the house margarita but wanted a kick so the bartender added fresh jalapenos.   I hope to make it back when we come to town for their happy hour.

The poke bowls, burritos, and corn are big hits and everyone always raves about what they got here! Amazingly trendy place with good atmosphere and great location in old town!",

We ordered the Brussels Sprouts nachos to start and we each ordered several tacos. The nachos are amazing and probably the most unique nachos I've ever had. There's delicious cheese, pickled veggies, Brussels sprouts (obviously), and even a fried egg!   We each ordered a chicken taco, a beef, and a plantain. All three were delicious, but the plantain is my favorite. I also really like to get the plantain taco bowl!    My friends also like to order their Sonoran hotdog. I've never had it, but it looks delicious and I want to try it.   Be sure to order a margarita while you're there! They have an amazing happy hour",

Again, the food was excellent and so were the drinks. All staff was very professional and did an outstanding job.   I had the shirt steak tacos and the Diego margaritas which were amazing. I recommend eating and drinking here. The way the manager spoke to the trainee doesn't sit well with me, especially with me owning a business myself.",

The menu is innovative with brussel sprouts nachos, which had two kinds of cheeses. The nachos had tortilla chips as well but I went back and forth between those and the brussel sprouts for good measure (and health)! They also had a list of amazing tacos, which you can get with handmade flour or corn tortillas.   I liked this place, but honestly, it's the only place (restaurant, bar, brewery) I went to on my weeklong trip to Arizona where I didn't talk to a single person. The people who come here reminded me of the Orange County (California) bunch at home.",

    "text": "**Service denial of a federally protected class** On the evening of Saturday, September 16- I brought 3 out of town guests to dine at what used to be my favorite Mexican spot in Scottsdale. I requested a table for 4 outdoors with an extra chair. The hostess told me immediately she was not able to bring me an extra chair. When asked why- she stated this is the \"policy\" of the restaurant. I asked to speak with a manager. The female \"manager\" on duty that evening, also in the same robotically trained tone, told me the same thing. You see, 4 months ago I almost lost my leg in a car accident when a man hit me and pinned me between two cars. I cannot sit for extended periods of time without being able to elevate my leg. I am just starting to be able to leave the house and this was a special occasion among friends for me to be able to get out for the evening. This female manager was extremely rude and kept repeating herself they would not \"inconvenience\" other guests and it was their policy to not allow an extra chair at my table, even though I am disabled and have special handicap passes provided to me by the government. When asked, she clearly stated it was the owner's policy to not allow this extra chair assistance. As you can see from my photographs, during our dinner- there were plenty of tables open from which an extra chair could have been borrowed and utilized until the restaurant was so packed, not one chair could be spared. Our table was in the back and completely out of any space that an extra chair would have been a fire hazard, gotten in any guests way or even a servers path. In my 20 years of restaurant experience, I would NEVER deny a person in special need of ANYTHING to make their intentional visit to my restaurant as comfortable as possible. Several guests could see my discomfort throughout our dinner and offered me the extra chair from their table, but the server was told to watch my table and not to allow it- and I had to politely decline as I didn't want my entire parties night to be ruined. I have never been made to feel so policed and so discarded as I was this evening at Diego Pops. I will NEVER return to this establishment, and I will NEVER send any more friends here either. It's quite a shame as I have been coming since it opened and it's become a favorite hot spot for my friends and family and I to dine.  I am Vegan and so is my boyfriend and because of the plantain tacos and vegan rice and beans options, it's a great pick for us. Anyway, I am absolutely disgusted by the complete and utter disregard by this staff and so called manager for my special needs and rights. This behavior is not only illegal, but really just quite disgusting in general. I certainly hope it is NOT the practice of the owner to deny his guests, with plenty of options to dine in our on-demand, rebounding economy- their basic human rights. Shame on you Diego Pops. Shame on you.",

It took at least 15 mins for anyone to even seats us and it was after what would be considered a \"dinner rush\" time. The food was bland, I ordered a burrito and it had no flavor at all... Only thing that helped it was the pickled onions on the side of the plate. The salsa served with the chips tasted overwhelmingly like horseradish which was just awful. The margarita was okay but I would never go back here again and I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. There are far better places with way better food than this place.

I usually don't complain or leave bad reviews but in this case it needs to be done. I came there a few months ago to meet my friends for lunch I had my dog with me. I was told that it wasn't a dog friendly place. Usually I wouldn't care and go somewhere else and not pull the service dog card. In this instance I was meeting people there that drove from north Scottsdale specifically to enjoy your tacos. I told the bartender that my dog was a service dog and that I was fine just being on the patio. At this point he said he needs to see paperwork. Strike one. Illegal. I told him that it's illegal to ask but luckily I did have all her papers in an email. It took me some time to find it since she has been certified for a few years now. At this point my friends showed up and we are standing around waiting on me. Finally I get them her papers. Bartender says he can't let us in !!!seriosuly?! We talk to a female manager that was the rudest person I have ever had a displeasure of meeting. She said I had to be blind or deaf and that's the only way they would let us in !!! How illegal is that? Learn the law. After wasting our time making me look for the papers then insulting me we still didn't get seated. We ended up going to farm and craft and talked to the people there who told us the owner of diego pops was a dog guy and they were very surprised by the way we were treated!!! I should sue the place and turn it into a pet store that serves tacos for the dogs! Teach your staff the law when it comes to people with disabilities!!! <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ada.gov%2Farchive%2Fqasrvc.htmhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.ada.gov%2Farchive%2Fqasrvc.htm&s=4342dfae906d5ea8ca845e7ad10218f115304d526fffab586b34355b1d219d72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ada.gov/archive/qasrvc.h...</a>",

I liked it so much and always wanted to sit outside on their adorable patio, so my fiance and I decided to venture away from downtown and try it for dinner this past Sunday evening.  We were seated immediately but our server was nowhere in sight.  It was at least 5 minutes before she even acknowledged us.  When she finally appeared, we ordered some drinks and appetizers....and then she disappeared again.  For a long time.   She finally came back (empty-handed) and took our dinner order.  She told us both the bar and the kitchen were running behind.  It was a fairly slow evening but we were understanding.  The drinks and appetizers were eventually delivered by a different person.  Everything was just beyond slow and took forever to come out, including our entrees.  Yet a third person (bartender?) brought us our second round of drinks at some point.  We asked her for extra tortillas and they never came.  Our server never checked back on us until we were done with our meal.  I'll reiterate - I love the food here.  And the patio is so quaint and cute.  But the service stinks.  I think I will stick with lunch take out.",

We had the traditional poke appetizer, good for a couple people. For dinner we tried the braised pineapple pork bowl and the shrimp tacos. Outstanding! They have a nice selection of homemade salsa/dressings to try with your meals, too. Really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back soon!",

Liked the salsa which came with the chips, but I wouldn't order the guacamole again. I had the chicken green chili tacos and they were tasty. Definitely going back to enjoy that patio.",

We started with really good chips and the 7-8 bottles of salsa that come with it for $1. Great chips and great variety of salsas. The Diego Pops margarita was small and weak for my taste (even for $4), Tacos, on the other hand, were really good. I had a fish taco, a pastor, and an adobo chicken taco. All great, and $7 for the 3 of 'em. I had a taste of my friend's plaintain taco, carne asada and shrimp, and they were all super, as well. We had churro fries (dulce de leche dipping sauce) for dessert. Meh. Tasty, but nothing special. Great service, and a nice cool patio. If you like Joyride and other \"upscaled\" taco joints, you'll like this. I'll be back.",

She recommended a few local beers for us to try after asking us questions about different preferences - She was spot on with her recommendation.  We ordered a bunch of different tacos, all which were delicious.  After a few beers, a bunch of tacos and they threw in an order of chips/salsa our bill was less than $30.  We will be back next time in Scottsdale.",

A very simple chips and salsa but they nailed it- just the right kind of spice and flavor, very good.  My second favorite part is the selection of condiments/sauces that they bring to your table.  My husband is a huge condiments fan, I can't wait to take him here.  I didn't go full 5 stars because our server wasn't the brightest- couldn't hear me at all and didn't get my order right.  However, everything was really tasty and very reasonably priced!  Total bill for a friend and I with drinks was less than $40.  I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited this place Saturday night after reading the rave reviews on Yelp. However, we were greatly disappointed.  The ambiance was great (the only reason I'm giving it a star); we were seated outdoors. However, the food was not good and the service stunk.  We ordered the guac and salsa which was pretty good. But I ordered two tacos with rice and beans, my husband ordered a bean and cheese burrito and requested grilled chicken be added to it.  After about 20 minutes of waiting for our food, it finally arrived and was cold and tasteless. I thought it was just my food, but my husband noted the same thing about his (cold and the beans tasted bland), along with the fact that no chicken was added to his burrito. So, he essentially had cold bland beans wrapped up in a tortilla.  Our waiter still charged us for the addt'l chicken so I took it out of his tip.  I would have told him about the incorrect charge but it took him FOREVER just to bring the food and bill. I didn't want to take addt'l time to wait for him to come around to adjust the bill.  I don't know what all the rage is about this place.  Definitely won't be visiting again.",

She didn't look up when we entered but proceeded to hold up a finger signaling us \"one moment.\" We asked politely to move tables from inside to outside shortly after we were seated. The same hostess acted like this was the most difficult task we could have asked. The restaurant was less than half full. We even caught her whispering to another waitress about us. Outside area is very pretty and nice atmosphere. Service was extremely slow to get to us outside. Once one waiter realized no one had attended to us for about 15min after being seated he took charge. He provided us speedy service and was very friendly. Overall I liked the food here and was grateful for the waiter we finally did get. This will not stop me from sharing my poor hostess experience with anyone asking about this new restaurant. It is inexcusable.",

The friendly bartender noticed us and helped us out.  We dined on the patio because the weather was gorgeous.  We waited a while at our table before a server greeted us and by the time he did come (we'd probably waited about 10 minutes) we were ready to order and anxious for drinks.  Our service was definitely lacking and not what I've come to expect here.  Although they were very busy, which I'm sure affected the service.  We didn't receive drink refills very quickly and when we did they did not add more ice.  We felt a bit rushed, and had to ask for everything we needed (more napkins, more plates, more silverware, drink refills, explanation of the sauces, etc) but all in all had a decent experience.  The yummy food made up for the lack of quality care.  The Brussel sprout nachos were divine, the skirt steak taco was delicious and my husband enjoyed his machaca and shrimp tacos as well.  I love the chips and salsa here!  This was the best batch I've had.  I could drink that stuff.  The sauces are awesome and so fun.",

The snow cone margarita is fun, but all of Diego Pops' drinks are good! The margarita is strong as well. The cheese quesadilla is always a good go to, and the tacos are delicious as well.

We've had tacos from Oaxaca to California to Texas and back. So it's safe to say we have had enough tacos to give you an opinion worth taking.   The pork and pineapple taco was perfect and the hint of pineapple was not overwhelming. The shrimp taco was spot on. I think it was my favorite.  The green chili taco was a bit spicy but good. The skirt steak taco was tender and flavorful. The cod taco was pretty good, nothing spectacular but good.  So Diego Pops gets an A+ for their tacos!  The margaritas on the other hand were just ok. Kinda weak. We've had so much better.  Still this place gets a 5star. It's not their fault the bartender is stingy with the tequila.",

Now for the bad. The $14 Margarita was weak. Also, There was a pub crawl, which I'm cool with! But they were obviously louder than normal and pretty obnoxious. The thing that made me mad was the manager apologized to every table by us. And gave out comps to those customers and not us. Probably because we were younger and the other tables were older crowds.  All in all the food and the waiter were  awesome but the overall experience was not too great today.",

We were seated immediately and our waitress was super friendly, cute and very helpful. For apps, we ordered the Brussel Sprout nachos with beef (by far the best part of our meal), guac -which was fine, and the plantains, which our friend loved.  For our entrees we ordered the shrimp tacos.  The presentation was just lame. They were small and looked as though they were thrown on the plate with some misc broken chips on the side and not a ton of flavor. Unfortunately we've had better tacos at random taco stands in regards to flavor, size and price.   Bottom line, if your meeting friends for drinks and just want some apps before heading somewhere else for dinner, this is a good option for fun atmosphere, good nachos, and friendly service.  But if your looking for amazing tacos or entrees, pass on Diego Pops.  It was worth trying but we won't be back.",

We started with the corn and it lacked any real flavor. I had the California burrito and again the flavor was really weak. My sister commented on the lack of any flavor on her black beans and I didn't get much in the way of flavor from the skirt steak or the pinto beans either. I had to add copious amounts of hot sauce just to get some flavor.  However, my sister did like her cod taco that was served Baja style I believe.  She did comment that her margarita was weak on the tequila. For a Mexican place I tend to think you should get the beans, flavor and tequila right. They definitely missed it on all three.",

Diego Pops does have a very nice presentation going for it and I did like the decor. For lunch I decided on the cheese quesadilla and the shrimp taco. The cheese quesadilla was better than expected and I loved the presentation that it came in! As for the shrimp taco it was decent but nothing too special as far as tacos go.  Service was a bit of a letdown however as once the restaurant got more busy it took a while to finish up my meal and get the check. Perhaps they were short staffed or just wasn't expecting so many people to show up but it wasn't too big of a deal.  Overall I would say that Diego Pops is a nice addition to the area but with the service being a bit of a letdown due to the slowness that I experienced at the end of my meal I would probably think twice about coming back here again. Also with so many Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area there are definitely better options for food.",

    "text": "Diego Pops, a location that has a pink sauce you put on your tacos. Now when I first came to eat at Diego Pops I was skeptical and confused with a bright pink roasted garlic, beets, and cream. My culinary teacher had always told me that we eat with our eyes first and foremost. So I was terrified, before I tasted this magical concoction. So I believe the quote that applies to Diego Pops is \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\"  When you first enter Diego Pops you notice a quote \"como Mexico no hay dos\" (Like Mexico there is not two) I have not been to a Mexican restaurant quite like this. My first thought was \"It is Scottsdale, I don't want to over pay for Mexican food.\" Everything was blown away as soon as I had gotten to taste my first appetizer Brussels sprouts nachos ($10) who knew that Brussels sprouts and pink taco sauce with an EGG on top make the best nachos I have ever had. These are not your basic nachos the brussels sprouts make this dish amazing, it provides a unique texture and crunch and the taste just melts away inside your mouth.   Okay if you get only one item at Diego Pops you HAVE TO HAVE TO get the Braised Green Chile Chicken Taco ($3.5). (Get corn tortillas 100% of the time all the time, anywhere!) Ok, I must confess I would not have ordered this item if I was not with my girlfriend, who is Mexican and super picky about her Mexican food (She says nothing is better than my momma's cooking and I agree). She told me that she half expected her mother to pop her head out of the kitchen.   What I regret not eating is the poke, after a certain amount of time (We came at 10pm) they do not serve poke. I heard it was great from a friend, but I will be sure to come extra early next time to try that poke poke. Overall this place is just amazing and I will be eating here regularly.  What I had eaten from best to worst:Braised Green Chile Chicken Taco ($3.5), Beef Machaca ($4), Brussels sprouts nachos ($10), Charred Skirt Steak ($4.5), Braised Pineapple Pork ($3.5)  California Burrito ($9)  Oh don't eat a California Burrito... it was below mediocre.",

TACOS. i liked them. i tried 4. normal size and $2-3 all day mondays. they have several different sauces to add to the eats, some good, some okay. smart doing taco days other than a tuesday. but really, shouldnt every day be taco day?  also theres a little ice cream bar but have yet to delve into that part of the biz.  good first impressions but this could easily lose a star with one slip up.  #sayyestotacos",

    "text": "It's about time old town Scottsdale offered a trendy, inexpensive, atmosphere that offers AMAZING Mexican food! Also, my favorite thing about this place is that there are healthy options! This is a great location right in the heart of old town surrounded by plenty of shops, art galleries, among many other things to do.   Diego Pops offers both inside/outside seating. Tables, booths, couches, and bar stools. There is also a bar with more fancy drinks without the use of Tequila than I've ever seen in a Mexican restaurant! Don't get me wrong...the Tequila was definitely flowing;) I'm a HUGE fan of coconut so if there are any coconut fans out there I highly recommend getting your drinks right from an actual coconut!  There was a lot of great items to choose from on the menu and my favorite go to item on this menu was the tacos. All of the tacos were great but the one that stood out from the rest was the shrimp tacos! YUMMMMMM! We had the s'mores dessert that tasted just like it was right off the campfire minus all the work it takes to make one!   Our waitress was very attentive and the manager was present ensuring that all of the customers were receiving the best service. Overall, we loved this place for the atmosphere, food, drinks and service and will definitely frequent here!",

I sit at the bar which is generally never full during the day. They have decent Mexican beers on tap so that keeps me happy - Dos Equis, Victoria, Pacifico, Modelo off the top of my head. I can't speak towards the cocktails. I'm not a big cocktail drinker, but I've heard their's are a bit underwhelming given the price.   Food - I stick with the tacos. I get two and a side. Never disappointed and highly recommend any of them. Salmon may be my favorite.   Also, it would be very remiss of you to not try their coconut soft serve. I get the tropical fruit one and add fruity pebbles. It's pretty damn delicious.",

I usually hate sitting at the bar, but the bartenders made us feel welcome. I had a carne asada soft taco. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but it was delicious! All of our food was great. Very good margaritas too. When my bartender asked if I wanted another margarita and I said no, he gave me an ice water without asking. We didn't stay long, but we had a great time and great service while we were there. We Uber'd it so I didn't deal with parking.",

With the rice and \"refried\" beans option For starters we had the chips and salsa and we also added on some guacamole... Omg they were soooo good... The salsa had a kick to it, which I love... And the guac was equally as tasty... I had the sangria rojo and it complimented the meal very well...  The bowl was pretty interesting when it arrived but once I started eating it, the favors were immense...  I can't wait to go back to try the tacos and cocktails  Such a good experience.. Will recommend to friends...   Ps- parking is great at this location! Side and front lots available",

My girlfriend and I had a great server, wish I could remember his name, he was super friendly (but not overly annoying) and explained the entire menu and drinks to us!  First of all, the set up in here is perfect and so fun! The whole place is a 50ish diner theme with a twist (Mexican food) and the patio is great. Lots of space to sit and a great fireplace.  The food was great especially when you consider that they just opened - I'm sure they are still working out a lot of kinks. We started with the corn queso, awesome flavor, could have been much warmer but still good. I had the house salad that was topped with a ton of awesome veggies and had some sort of garlic vinaigrette that was delicious  - I chose the steak as the meat and definitely glad I did. It was cooked perfectly. My friend had the Poke and also liked her food a lot!!   The alcohol selection is good- they make all their margaritas fresh and don't use any pre made mixes. They also have tequila flights, we opted out of this but I'm sure it's pretty legit if you are a tequila lover. For dessert, they have an ice cream bar!!!!!! (Obviously I really liked this part- even though we didn't order anything). It was super adorable and you can just walk in and order at the ice cream bar if you don't want an entire meal.   This place was great, we will definitely be back! Check it out- I really want Diego Pops to stick around :)",

There were spaces at the bar, huge empty tables, 4 tops, booths and two tops all appearing ready for the sitting. There looked to be ample servers and bartenders to adequately service the entire place. We were greeted by a woman that all but told us to go away. Actually, that is what she said. \"Look, our kitchen is backed up, it's going to be at least an hour wait. Tonight isn't a good night.\" We questioned that for a minute, then conferred among ourselves. We decided we weren't in a hurry. We hadn't seen this group of people in so long that there would be a lot of catching up to do.  We went back to the woman and let her know we were happy waiting. We'd just go to the bar and have a few drinks.  \"No, you won't. We don't have any clean glasses.\" The one couple at the bar turned around wide eyed and told us to \"just leave. Seriously, it's horrible. We ordered an appetizer a half hour ago and we can't even get a drink.\" Seriously. What the f is going on?",

Service was horrendous! Margarita was ew. Not much more to say.",

No hello! I wasn't sure if she was even our waitress. But lo and behold she came back and asked us for our order several minutes later. I would've thought maybe she was a bad egg, but all the staff was the same. No greetings and no smiles.

The street taco portions look small, for the $4.5 price, so I went for a bowl size. While the portion does not look big, if you ate nachos or something as an app, you will still have enough left over to take home in a box.",

    "text": "It's a fact, I am somehow cursed with horrible customer service everytime I try to branch out to new restaurants around the valley.  Diego pops looked like it had a great atmosphere and food when I bookmarked it on yelp. I've been trying to convince my husband to try it out with me,  and yesterday he finally agreed to go for my birthday dinner. What a mistake.   We came for dinner around 7pm and were promptly greeted and sat on the patio.  The misters were really nice and kept the space cool. After sitting at the table for 5 minutes without being greeted by our server, I had a bad feeling that things were going to be like this for the rest of the dinner.  Once our server finally decided to show up, we ordered two margaritas (diego and prickly pear) and some waters. I was pretty thirsty so I sucked down my water pretty quickly. The first round of drinks took over 5 minutes but I was willing to let that slide. Once she delivered the drinks, we ordered chips w gauc and salsa, and I asked her for a water refill. The water never came. From the time she took our appetizer order, we didn't see her again for over 20 minutes. The bar was dead yet it took long periods of time to get simple drinks.  Our margaritas were not overly sweet (a good thing), but they were so watered down; either the bartender shook the crap out of them,  or they were sitting to be picked up for awhile.  Or honestly,  probably both.  Terrible pours on those margaritas.   The food runner brought out our appetizer and again, no water was brought to the table.    Our margaritas and waters were both empty and we had finished our appetizer before we saw her again.  When she came back, we ordered some a la carte tacos and two casadores margaritas (I was hoping a slightly better tequila would equate to a better margarita,  wrong). The food took awhile but it was actually pretty good and the portions were larger than expected. I jokingly commented to my husband that we probably wouldn't see our waitress again until I was done with my meal...almost,  I was eating my last taco before she ever asked how our food was.   A younger couple next to us was also irate with their service.  I tend to be lenient with servers because I work in the industry, but our server was not busy, just inept. The girl next to us was talking angrily and loudly about how they didn't have silverware or sauces for their food. The male got up and went inside in search of some service. That's pretty embarrassing for your establishment.    There was another girl server on the patio that was really doing a good job, and I was very sad we got stuck with the crappy one we got. Received our bill for $72 bucks and left pretty pissed.  Pros- Nice patio Decent tacos (although the jalapeno on the bbq chicken taco was wayyyy too hot; and I enjoy spicy food) Shrimp taco was awesome Food runner seemed on point  Cons- Possibly the worst server I've ever experienced Expensive, watered down crap margaritas ($10 a piece)  What a waste of a birthday dinner.",

I really like the guacamole but the chips need to improve ASAP ! Been stale all of my visits . ( it's not that hard to make tasty fresh tortilla chips!)   The reason   for 3 stars is : Bar. I have had to correct my own margaritas . Either too much sweet or too much sour. The other cocktails are very weak . I had 4 specialty  drinks yesterday and did not even feel a little buzz lol. My two girlfriends said the same . Our tab was over $150 .. Should be able have a little fun from that ! NO.    The experiences I have had with the bartenders is lame ! I really think they need to re think who they hire. Bar staff seems grumpy and annoyed if you sit there and very unexperienced. ( perhaps they recruited from a Olive Garden or Sizzler ?!) Highly suggest they get some bartenders who have been working high volume bars in the area. They will bring in a better vibe, higher clientele and most importantly better drinks !

    "text": "We have been coming here weekly for over a year. Over the last few months the service here has gotten worse and worse each week. Today was the final straw. Service at the bar was atrocious to say to least. Had to order my drink twice before it finally arrived. Never offered a water. Put an appetizer order in. Had to ask for utensils/napkin. Never asked if I wanted another drink despite being empty the entire time I was there. Had to order the pork bowl twice because the first guy at the bar never actually entered the order in the computer. Had to ask for the check after 15 minutes of sitting after we were all done. Just overall terrible service. Again, this wasnt a one-time event; every week it has gotten worse. Which is unfortunate, because the food here is really good. But with so many other restaurants in Old Town don't waste your time and money here.",

The service was slow, the food overpriced, and flavorless. They also ran out of guacamole, forgot to put in my friends order, then charged us for it. Diego Pops does have some redeeming qualities; chips and salsa are good, beer is cool, and their patio is fantastic. However, I will probably never go back because there is such a saturation of restaurants in the Phoenix area. Most with much better food and service.   Sooo... I went back this past Saturday. I am happy I did. My S.O. and I were trying to decide where to eat before the Huey Lewis concert at Live Wire. Our choices are limited due to his dietary restrictions. I reluctantly agreed to Diego Pop's. We sat at the bar and were greeted by Nick. He was very friendly, hospitable, and thoughtful(explained the ingredients in the cocktails). We had a couple cocktails, split the brussel sprout nachos and ordered two tacos each. I must say, the food was delicious and the drinks were stiff and tasty! The service that we received from Nick and the other bartender (didn't catch his name) was very good! We will be back. Thank you!",

The menu was also creative and definitely something different from your average Mexican restaurant.  The let-down was after the food came. I ordered a a steak taco and a chicken adobo taco with an horchata. My husband ordered coconut ceviche and more tacos. Our tacos were served cold and lacked flavor. The salsa was okay. No limes were served with our tacos. To top it off, service was horrible. We waited so long for our food to come out and our waiter was practically non-existent.  Don't think we will ever be coming back. Maybe for happy hour? But not for food.",

Highly recommend those even though you may think you won't like them. It still consists of chips and delicious nacho toppings, it just has a sprinkle of Brussels Sprouts leaves on top! Their sauces are great, and plenty to chose from! They have fun cocktails and the presentation of the cocktails is top notch! One of the cocktails is made in a coconut! So cute! Service is always great and I definitely recommend this place!",

The Jicama and Cucumber side is lazily presented with no seasoning and an apilo style sauce. The rice is dry and overcooked in a tiny plastic cup used for sauces. The beans corn, pineapple, and peppers all seem to be from a can. The only saving grace of this establishment is the Margaritas and plantains. I will not he returning again unless it is to get drunk and forget how terrible the food is. I guess for a Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale I should have known what to expect.",

Neon lights on the wall, huge booths, nice bar, etc. It looks pretty small when you walk in but once you turn the corner there is a bunch more seating.   To start, we ordered the chips and salsa which came in a huge pan. For dinner, I had the pineapple braised pork but I did it as bowl instead of a taco. It came with rice and pinto beans and it was AMAZING. The pork was so well done and mixed really well with the slaw and pineapple on top. 10/10 would for sure recommend.   This place also has a great drink menu and happy hour. ALSO, I'll be sure to come back for taco Monday too-3 dollar tacos all day!",

We had no reservations just walked in we were seated fairly quick( about 5 min wait) For a Tuesday night the place was pretty packed, our server Lexi suggested the Mexican mule cocktail which were perfect. They also have a nice selection of mezcal. For food Our group had a few different options. We had the Brussel sprout nachos  agua Chiles, mango habanero wings, chips and guacamole, machaca tacos, salmon bowl, California burrito and last but no least we shared a sonora hot dog. All the food was great the salmon was perfectly grilled, the wings had the perfect amount of heat, the guacamole was citrusy and light I really loved the sprinkle of queso fresco on top. The sonata hot dog was FUEGO best one I've had anywhere. Before the end of the night we walked over and thanked the amazing kitchen for a delicious meal! I can't remember the chefs name I just know she was very short and friendly and happy to talk to us. Our server Lexi provided great service I definitely give D POPS A 5! I will be coming back for more soon!",

    "text": "I have come to Diego Pops a few times prior to this visit, but will not be coming back after my last experience... I had come in a group-we were told that the wait time would be 30 minutes. After waiting an hour, we were finally ushered to a table. That table ended up seating two fewer people than were in our party. Despite being seated at a table that could not accommodate our party, we were trying to make it work and were able to squeeze an extra person on the couch. We then asked for an additional chair to fit the final person in our group. We even pointed out an empty chair across from our table that we were going to slide over. When we mentioned this to our waitress, she told us we could not move the chair. After explaining the seating situation, she said she would talk to the head hostess about moving the empty chair. The hostess told us the chair could not be moved and that our only option would be to split us up.  At this point we were very frustrated (the wait time was off by 30 minutes, the table they gave us did not seat the amount of people we had told them were in our party, and they would not let us slide over a chair so that we could sit together).  We asked for the manager..the waitress came back and said the manager was running food and couldn't come talk to us. At this point, my group had had enough and decided to leave. I saw the manager behind me and decided to walk up to him and explain the situation. I have worked as a manager in customer service fields and see the importance making the management aware of issues. The manager I spoke with was named Cory.  When I began explaining what had happened,  I was immediately interrupted. Cory said that the wait time was out of their control as they can't control how busy it is. I then continued trying to explain the situation. Cory then interrupted again and said he didn't even know if there is a chair he could give us. He clearly was not listening to what I was saying. It was very disappointing that he did not take the time to actually listen and attempt to make the situation right. Instead, I got a bunch of excuses. I expect more out of the staff and management. I would recommend saving yourself from bad customer service, and choosing to go to one of the many other happy hour and Mexican food places nearby.",

Upon arriving we sat down at the bar and asked the bartender what they recommended because it was our first time. Acting annoyed that we even asked they said we are known for our Brussels sprouts nachos which we said didn't sound good at the moment. We then said we were feeling something seafood, and again they told us to get the nachos with disgust. Sitting there with no good recommendation we asked the gentleman next to us what he was having, and we asked for the same thing. What we received was not the same thing. When we asked about it the bartender seemed annoyed that we even said anything. To try and ignore this awful experience we got to know the nice guy next to us. After a nice conversation, the fellow offered to buy us drinks. He asked the bartender if she could get us drinks and she proceeded to tell him she refuses to serve him or us. Clearly confused because we had nothing wrong or obscure to prompt that the nice man asked for the manager at the time. Cory the manager then proceeded to yell at the gentleman when he explained the situation, making us feel unsafe and very uncomfortable. After yelling at the nice man for a few minutes Cory then tried to offer us coupons. We refused and said we will never be returning here again. And the icing on the cake was when the bartender tried to keep our change. Absolutely awful experience, terrible service, and the management was just as bad.",

Hardly the best I'm sorry to say, but quite disappointed. It was \"OK\". The brussel sprout nachos were a surprisingly good change of pace for nachos, quite tasty (thank you to our server who recommended them!), watermelon and Paloma margaritas were pretty good (Paloma was the better of the 2), but my bean & cheese burrito was boring (no sauce, just a tortilla filled with refried beans and cheese.... no jalepenos, no sauce, nada, again, OK but I make better at home. The adobo chicken tacos were ok, the pineapple pork ones were better. I read other reviews that stated the staff aren't shy to remind you when it's closing time and this was our case as well. Very polite but basically \"Last call at the bar would you like another?\" \"Yes please!\" then as they were set in front of us \"We're technically closed right now so no rush but we're closed.\" It was 5 minutes before the scheduled closing time. I get people are tired and want to leave but..........",

If you have choice between chipotle or here come to this hip spot. I came in to place an order and their manager was super nice. He let me go home with one each sauce.  I had their Brussels sprout nachos, shrimp taco and the guac and chips. The best vegetarian nachos ever!! Loaded with perfectly roasted Brussels sprout, corn, melty cheese. Topped with an egg!!! Delicious!! The shrimp taco was loaded with fresh corn salsa and moist shrimp. The best sauces were salsa verde and avocado puree. The were both on the milder side. But the other sauce were just as good, but too hot for my whimpy taste buds. Everything is great except for one down fall, what kind of Mexican restaurant does not have a side order of guac for their tacos and nachos! You guys could easily make money selling a little side of guacamole. So I ordered the guacamole app because this California loves her avocados. The appetizer is a generous portion of guac. Will definitely be back soon and not just for a lunch order to go.",

Appetizers were half off and beers were $1 off and our margaritas came surprisingly back at only $5. The chips and queso is fantastic and has some sweet corn in it that adds to the flavor. The food was very good and the prices were fair, I had the house burrito for $9. The service was great. The place was busy but we were always attended to and the servers cross-covered each other so there was no lack or continuity in service. I would definitely recommend coming here for Mexican food if you're in Scottsdale or the Phoenix area.",

Always cooked properly, large portions for one taco and I have tried several, all have never let me or my BF down. Green chile chicken-awesome, adobo chicken- so moist!, grilled shrimps- lots of shrimp, good char and great flavor and then the show stopper-----Pineapple Pork Tacos!!! So excellent! The pork, the sweet, the slaw, gosh, just whenever you need a happy mood and happy mind....get one. Oh my, paired with all their awesome sauces including a very peculiar beet one that is really good, these tacos will not let you down. Their margs are great and their corn queso also tops it off as a well rounded, stuffed happy meal. Really, Really love this place :)",

We were greeted right away and told the server that it was our first time here. She suggested the Brussel sprout nachos, so we ordered those. While waiting for those to arrive we each ordered 2 tacos. Two shrimp, one pineapple pork and one steak.  After 30 minutes we were still waiting for the nachos and had already asked the server what the hold up was. She blamed the kitchen yet we kept seeing others getting their food before us. She said she told her manager about the delay. When they finally arrived they were good but nothing amazing as I was expecting from reviews I'd seen.  The tacos arrived shortly after along with a bunch of sauces. I realized after taking a bite of the steak taco that the sauce is provided to add flavor to otherwise bland tacos.  Once we finished we waited again for the server to realize we were done and bring the check. The table across from us was also having issues with getting their food. I'm not sure if it was the servers issue or the kitchen or a combination. Either way it was not a good experience the manager never came by and we won't be back. This seems to be a typical Old Town tourist restaurant.",

    "text": "I've been hearing about Diego Pops for some time now, especially with their Brussel Sprout nachos. I love Brussel sprouts, if you cook and season them correctly so I was so excited to try this place.   It is south of the Montauk and the restaurant has their own private parking lot but it is small. When we walked in, we immediately dig the vibe - kinda like a 60's diner. The employees right away were really friendly. Our server went over the menu and we decided on the famous Brussel sprout nachos, a cod taco with flour tortilla and a beef machaca taco with a crispy taco.   The nachos were a generous portion!! I suggest you share with a group of at least 4 people. We practically only made a dent. It was good, no doubt about that. The tacos though - eh, not so much. They were okay. The flavors just didn't mesh well together and the crispy cod was a little soggy.   We then ordered a churro sundae for dessert. They top the vanilla ice cream with dulce de leche and it was pretty yummy. The churros that came with it needed some work though. I didn't think they were that great, but I ate it because the combination of the cinnamon and ice cream was good.   Our bill wasn't bad. It's not crazy cheap but not over the top either. I wouldn't go back for the tacos, but I would go back to try the other items on the menu and take advantage of their happy hour.",

    "text": "When a taco shop comes up with taco Monday you know this isn't the run of the mill taco joint. I like everything about this place. Plantain tacos yes please.  It's cooling off in Arizona so Monday we went and got a taco outside on the covered patio which was the best way I can imagine to enjoy the first beautiful day of fall. Service was great. Food was great. Company was great but that didn't have anything to do with Diego pops. Six sauces come with your order. I'm a fan of the habanero stufThis is one of those places that I feel lucky to have close enough that I can go all the time. The one thing I notice is evenings it's more of a cantina and can get a little loud. I would recommend it for happy hour and I imagine they have some great drinks to go with a great menu. Let me say this I have been here at least six time so far and every time the food has been consistently good. I can't even say that about my three most favorite restaurants. This place deserves to consideration for that spot. If I could find any fault maybe twice the service was average or slightly subpar nothing to complain about. Most of the time the service is excellent. Also easy parking they have more than one lot",

Really cute for a girls night or just a quick bite to eat. I got the elote which was super good especially with the crushed hot Cheetos on top, just a little dry. They have 6 amazing sauces at your table so I added the verde ranch and it took my elote to the next level. Their horchata was refreshing and just the perfect level of sweet. Highly recommend both. The chicken taco was nothing special but I really like that each taco comes with tortilla recommendations. I got the green Chile taco with crispy tortilla and it was good especially with the different salsas! Great place for lunch or dinner :) Ill try the Brussel sprout nachos and a Marg next time!",

First time was to hold us over while we were waiting for our table at Montauk (which was over-rated by the way... should've stayed at Diego Pops.) I ordered a bloody mary, the jicama/cucumbers with chipotle greek yogurt dip and a shrimp taco. All of the things were amazing. The bloody mary mix was zesty and refreshing!  We came back again for a light dinner prior to our red eye flight back to the east coast. Sat at the bar again, and had great amicable bartenders waiting on us, who dealt with all our modifications and requests with grace.  We ordered salads - I order the kale and brussels sprouts salad with the jalapeno vinaigrette and added steak and shrimp (double protein, not half and half). The salad was warm and nourishing, and completely satisfying.  We also ordered the pineapple ceviche to start, and were not disappointed. All in all great spot for food, drinks, friendly service, and instagram-worthy ambience.",

I HATE giving bad reviews but I have to after this night... I was with a group of 10 for a birthday on a Friday night, so we had a 30 min wait, as expected. No problem! We went to the bar while we waited. Bartender messed up my order which was only two drinks. Only got one. My friend ended up telling him I never got my drink (this was after my boyfriend already paid for two) He nodded w a blank look on his face & then went to make my drink. He hands me my drink, and then hands me a bill. I tried to have a conversation with him about how we had already paid for it but he said that the other drink (wrong drink) was for the girl next to us and he had assumed she was with us (?) and that's what we paid for before. No apology, nothing, I was so shocked. I was about to pay because I was just over it but my friend explained again and he did his whole blank nod again and walked off. Great service.  when we were sat down, the table was for 8, and when we said it was for 10, the lady says \"you said it was for 8.\" Like, dang, you all suck here, I guess. Service was bad for the remainder of the night and food was just okay, very over priced for serving sizes.",

I came across this place and knew right away that I had to try it and I am SO glad I did! Everything about this place was delicious and beautiful.   For starters, they have such an impressive drink menu but I decided to go with the Watermelon Mint margarita after my waiter recommended it and it was SO good! The perfect balance of every ingredient, nothing was too overpowering. We ordered chips and salsa for the table and it was honestly one of the best salsas I've ever had. For my meal I ordered their cheese quesadilla which is technically one of their starters, but I added avocado and corn. I'm not exaggerating when I say I could eat that quesadilla every day. There was a weird, pepto-bismol looking drizzle on top which I was skeptical about but it was so tasty!   Overall I could not recommend this place enough and it's very upsetting for me because I live 2,000 miles away. I'll just dream about it until I get to go back.",

This place is always packed, we went in a Wednesday night and it was still busy! We had a party of 12, they easily sat us within 10-15 minutes. You have to try the snow cone margarita, the watermelon lime flavor is the best and the perfect treat for summer. There are plenty of vegetarian options and it's super easy to veganize, which is amazing. We started with chips and salsa. The salsa is probably one of the best I've ever had, it's super spicy and has great flavor. Can I buy it in a jar? I'll have to ask next time. Next we got an order of brussel sprout nachos, and holy heck! They are life changing. The chip to cheese ratio was a little off, but they were so delicious we didn't even care. I got a brussel sprout taco and plantain taco. I wasn't really a fan on the plantain, it's a weird texture thing for me ( I don't like bananas at all ) and it was a little sweet. The brussel sprout taco was delicious and would prefer that over the plantain personally. Everyone in my party loved the food and we can't wait to go back !",

Why?  Fresh ingredients, creative menu, fabulous drinks, and a fun and casual ambiance.  Professional and deft service.    Not just five stars in its genre - five stars, period.",

We didn't get the pineapple wall background but that didn't matter once the food came out! We had the street corn queso, chicken quesadillas, and a bean and cheese burrito at the table.  The salsa...   Quesadillas great (we added chicken) and the burrito was also good. We also got the watermelon margarita snow cone... yeah, I said margarita SNOWCONE. So fun and so yummy! We came to the conclusion it was rimmed with watermelon warheads  but it was so refreshing!  I will say none of us were terribly impressed with the street corn queso and felt it needed more flavor. Granted we still ate it after we mixed in some salsa because the salsa was just so good...but alone the queso was just ok.  We were short on time but their happy hour menu is legit! We will be going back soon to try more amazing options and of course take some real cute foodie photos!",

The margaritas are fantastic as well and after a few we switched it up to the Snow margaritas - say yes to the chili rim on yours.   I'd love for Diego Pops to come to Austin. I'm saddened to know I have to fly all the way to AZ to enjoy that again.",

Upon searching, we found this place and it definitely had a cool vibe. There's an outdoor seating area which we sat in. It was perfect for the surprisingly not so hot day in town!  Happy hour: they have happy hour from 3-6 and it's  1/2 off apps, and discounted beer, sangria, and margaritas. We definitely took advantage of the apps but the downside was that they didn't have a very good margarita menu. I was expecting to get some kind of flavor added but they weren't able to do that aside from the specialty margs already on the menu.   Tacos/burritos: my friend had the California burrito and she said it was amazing! I had the braised pork and green Chile chicken tacos. The chicken taco was very good but the pork just needed for taste. The pineapple was the thing that has the most flavor. I ordered some cilantro brown rice to go with it and that also needed more flavor.   Service: our server was awesome! Attentive enough without being overpowering.",

We tried the famous brussel sprouts nachos, and they were a good flavor...but my God were they greasy. Dont get me wrong, they were good! But they were /wet/ from being so oily, and I got a little stomach disruption because of it, so... just depends on how you feel about greasy foods - my only heads up for this place (or at least that dish in particular).  Otherwise I'll be back to try more of the different dishes in the future! To get more of a secure opinion on this place.",

It was just water. No hints of lime.  Starters were served at the end. Drinks came out half way through my meal. It wasn't super crowded too.

After a short wait, we are seated. We are then abandoned for 13 minutes. I counted. Brian is confused. He goes Kim I swear I've never had to wait this long for service. Someone overhears us and comes to get our drink order.  Thanks someone because I was 2 minutes away from leaving. I don't acknowledge that I was waiting because well my mother taught me to never be rude to the people cooking or serving your food. ( you guys know why) A few minutes later a manager walks by to apologize. Thank you for that. That spoke volumes. That alone is the reason I will always come back.  Now on to the good stuff.  I order the Diego margarita, which was delicious and strong! (Yum) he orders horchata (he seemed to love it).  We order the delicious light airy chips mixed in with platanos, with a side of Queso... not sure what was in  the queso... probably crack... but... I almost licked the container clean... (not sorry) and the most delicious guacamole I've tasted. It was simple and straight to the point, non of that extra filler crap that restaurants like to mix in.. thank you for that.   Now on to the tacos  From 1-5  Braised pineapple pork tacos a 10 forget the scale. The best pork tacos I've ever had. The pineapple and cojita with the pork set my tastebuds into a frenzy that was hard to take control of. I'd kill for these tacos .. (jk, or am I?)  Grilled Shrimp tacos .. a 2 I can make these at home... after eating the braised pineapple pork tacos first... eating the shrimp was underwhelming. Skip them.  Grilled adobo chicken taco. A 5. Tasty especially when you add the pink sauce to neutralize the \"spice\". Yummmmm! Very savory and spicy. A second favorite.  Still thinking about the braised pineapple pork tacos....  Get the coconut rice. Don't ask why. Just get it. It's delicious. That is all.   And ask for a second margarita but only if you're not driving.  Just a few FYI's  The smaller the group the easier it is to seat you guys.  Parking is tight.  Dog friendly. Friendly staff, be nice to them. Kid friendly but seriously.. leave them at home, this place is much too good for children. Enjoy this with your adult friends. Get the margaritas, they are worth the price. Monday's are for $3 tacos!   Happy hour is from 3-6 All week.    I'll be back.",

    "text": "First review of 2017! My friend and I loved this spot. I suggested it since we wanted somewhere in Old Town and it was one of my bookmarks. We started off with drinks; I got Mexican Sprite (tasted similar to regular Sprite) and my friend got iced tea. I already know I wanted to order the brussels sprouts nachos from the rave reviews and my friend wanted guacamole so we ordered both. SO MANY CHIPS. I loved the nachos; the sprouts were charred and lots of flavor with the peppers, corn, cheese and the extra sauces they brought to our table. It was fun trying them all. Happy hour meant appetizers were half off, great deal.  We decided to also get shrimp tacos on flour tortilla and I thought it was delicious. You can choose corn or crispy tortilla and get rice and other sides with it for more money. Diego Pops doesn't do Taco Tuesday BUT they do have Taco Monday, which gets them twice the customers for those thinking they have special deals on Tuesday.   Our server was friendly and funny and the place itself is cute. We sat outside as did most everyone else and they had heaters and candles to set the ambiance. I'd come back, they've got a good selection of items on their menu and food was tasty.",

But what does it matter when they are SO delicious.  They start you off with some free chips and salsa. Make sure to also ask for their numerous other sauces and ailolis, which they provide gratis. I ordered the skirt steak, adobo chicken and salmon tacos, which I listed in order of deliciousness. Honestly, these tacos are so flavorful and well balanced that adding extra sauce is a mistake as it throws off the flavor profile. I enjoyed them as each bite was packed with flavor.   The service was a tad slow, but the server was pleasant.   I definitely would love to try a poke bowl (assuming I can get it without pineapple. DIE pineapple!) and a breakfast burrito looks delicious too. This is a nice, affordable spot full of tasty tacos in the midst of pricey spots in oldtown Scottsdale. What's not to like?",

We just decided to have drinks and chips. We arrived about 10 minutes before their happy hour ended and our waitress warned us that if we wanted their deal of half off appetizers we had to order before the ending time. I asked if we could still order drinks at happy hour and suddenly it was like a flip switched and our server went from being nice and bubbly to almost angry seeming. She responded \"no\" and quickly walked away. When she came back we order our chips and salsa and our full priced drinks (we went with drinks that weren't on the happy hour menu anyways) the Watermelon Lime Snow Cone Margaritas. The chips were really good but insanely salty, but like you know when things are really salty and it make them addicting? Yeah that's how they were haha, and our Snow Cone Margs were super yummy but didn't taste like there was any alcohol in them. We decided not to say anything as to not upset our server anymore. Want to come back for a better experience with a different serve and also try more of their food, so overall a decent dining experience.",

The ambiance of this restaurant made for an excellent scene for pop photography. Bold neon makes an appearance around every corner; neon lettering reads \"Como Mexico no hay dos\" (there is no place like Mexico) and baby blue-colored booths are book-ended by neon-printed pineapple wallpaper.   I ordered the \"Sweet Corn + Avocado Caesar\" Salad complete with grilled salmon. This salad was served in perfect portion and proportion, making an flavorful balance of sweet and savory. I love the array of salsa that is provided with crispy tortilla chips - do not hesitate to sample each salsa and add more to your salad if you wish.   Very friendly and accommodating staff and management. I felt very welcome and comfortable in their establishment.   Be careful when parking - small lot just in front of restaurant may fill very quickly.   Please refer to my photos for more on my experience.",

I was hooked after having the sangria. It was amazing! Then the bartender Ashlyn made another guest some kind of snow cone margarita. Wow, it was the coolest drink I've seen. I mentioned that and Ashlyn told me to try the guava coconut. Well, once again, I was amazed as it was mixed in a carved out coconut! The food is just as amazing  as the drinks. Try the braised green chili chicken tacos, you will not be disappointed! Have Ashlyn make you a drink and your night will be complete.",

    "text": "Went in and had a shrimp taco, Mexican corn and chips and guacamole.  Very good tasting food, however two big  problems: First, the tortilla with my shrimp taco was not fresh made; no way!  I had everyone at my table look at the tortilla and taste it and the consensus was all the  same, \"Not a fresh made tortilla!\" The tortilla had a factory taste and look.  Seriously, the manager had the nerve to look me in the face and tell me that \"all\" tortillas were made fresh daily.  I've eaten and cooked enough with store bought packaged tortillas and fresh made market tortillas to know the difference.  Prior to speaking with the manager, I asked our server if the tortillas were made fresh and her response was,\"I believe so.\" Seriously,  all your primary dishes are served with tortillas, and the menu says that all tortillas are made fresh and your response is, \"I believe so?\"  That leads me to believe that they are not.  When I advised the manager in regard to her server's response, I received the following response, \" I have three new employees in training and I don't expect them to know everything.\"  Seriously, in case you didn't know that your primary food is tacos and burritos and you don't expect a server to know 100% that the tortillas  are made fresh??? Sounds like the manager wasn't even sure!  Overall,  I would recommend this place, but pretty bothered by the lack of knowledge and the manager's poor excuse.  Look, if you ran out of fresh made tortillas because I came in at 7:00 PM then so be it, just be honest and don't make up excuses for your employees.",

All in all great place though!",

I was a little disappointed, but again because I'm an ice lover, so I thought the ice was too hard for me to actually take bites and enjoy.

We asked for napkins from a busser & 15 min later still didn't have any. I had to get up to get them from the back myself. Never got a refill on drinks or got check. We were done for 20 min and no one approached us. Started getting harassed by a drunk group by fire pit over taking our extra chair we were using for our purses. Kept arguing about how a persons isnt sitting there. We gave in & moved our things. This group was falling out of their chairs and burning MENUS yet the business kept serving them MORE alcohol. Finally threatened to throw them out if they burned another menu. Which they did. But restaurant didn't cut them off or throw them out. Just came back & scolded them. Finally got fed up with waiting & getting harassed so I got up to ask for the check. I was so pissed we spoke to a manager about our server disappearing and the obviously drunk group outside. Manager apologized once and that was it. Didn't invite us back or wish us a good night. Poor customer service from top down. I guess if you're not an obnoxious drunkard, you won't enjoy yourself.",

I'm disappointed to say that after waiting at least 20 minutes for our drink order we received the worst watered down Margaritas we've ever had and I'm not only talking the cheap ones for Happy Hour.  I did order the happy hour margarita and it not only was watered down but had an awful after taste My husband got a margarita with Grand Marnier and he said his was watered down and just awful. We actually asked the waitress to take them back and hoped for the best for dinner since by then we were starving. But dinner wasn't much better. My husband ordered 2 beef tacos with a side, $2.00 extra, of cilantro-lime brown rice and he received 2 itty bitty tacos with very bland brown rice. Later that night he still was complaining about the bad taste he still had in his mouth from the awful tacos. I had the salmon bowl with quinoa which was filling but the salmon was a little on the fishy smelling side, not great; maybe actually steel-head trout??? They have a great outdoor patio but it is so loud out there that you can't hear the person across from you speak. We tried to do the Yelp check-in and the waitress said we couldn't because the $5.00 off check-in was only for 1 taco and 1 beer and since we didn't want the beer we couldn't use it; sounded pretty silly since we ordered more than what was required but in a place like this we weren't surprised. Certainly no reason to ever return.",

I asked other employees, another shrug. \" you mean you have no spicy salsa, sauce, nothing spicy!!!\" \" no sorry sir this is Scottsdale\". I'm not a spicy freak to be clear. They don't have Tabasco or anything even close to being hot. They have  \"habanero oil\".

She was pleasant, not super talkative, just pretty much all business, which is totally fine with me.  Larger tables are going to get less talking from the server.  Makes sense.  Ordered some appetizers, ceviche and guacamole, both excellent.  Jessica came back a little later to check on us and took our lunch orders.  Food came out, looked and tasted awesome.  Everyone had finished their food in about 10 minutes or so.  Table was bussed, dishes cleared and what not.   No Jessica.  10, 15, 20, 30 minutes later, no Jessica.  Where did she go?  Two of my guests had to go to another meeting so they left.  About 10 minutes later, Jessica appeared with the bill.  Weird right?  Usually, lunch time, you get in and you get out pretty close to when you finish eating.  3 stars for some slightly slow service, everything else was worth 5 stars.  I'll be back for sure, maybe Jessica had an off day.  Full disclosure, I don't believe in tipping under for bad service, not that Jessica's service was bad, was just very very slow.  Jessica still got 20% which is really my minimum.  I ended up leaving right after signing the bill roughly around 1:15 pm, again, arrived at 11:30 am finished eating around 12:15 pm.",

Upon strong recommendations we ordered the Brussels sprouts nachos for the table to share. They were delicious!! Definitely a must get if you visit.   We had a friendly waiter who provided great service. So why 3 stars? Someone who was not our waiter came by to let us know they were closing soon and we had 5 minutes to finish up. Not a problem! We were working on finishing up our remaining meals. Less than 2 minutes later the same person came back and took our meals from the table without asking if we were finished (I was still enjoying my bowl). The end of this service left a poor impression and I will question if I will return back here, despite the delicious food.",

We started the the mango jalapeno wings. They had a spicy aftertaste but I felt like the overall lacked a substantial amount of flavor and didn't quite live up to my expectations. They were also a little pale in color which made them appear a little less appetizing.   My husband ordered he beef machacha tacos on a corn tortilla. They were delicious. Both fresh and savory. The side of coconut rice was a little dry and needed more flavor.  My trail mix salad with green chili chicken was delicious. It was robust with flavor, and hearty enough to satisfy even those weary about salads.  Service was as bright and friendly as the ambiance of the establishment. I can see why so many people rave about Diego Pops!",

The chips were the perfect  crunch, yet soft at the same time, and the pickled onions. I would have LOVED to have more of those. Cotija and another type of cheese. And that pink cream sauce Just yummy.  My girlfriend would still like to have her correct order of two green chili tacos, too. She only got one and it was thrown together.

I watched the bartender palm grab the snowcone ice and put it in my drink. I then saw her pull up her jeans, grab dirty glasses from the top, touch the tips of straws, handle dirty plates, touch her bare skin, handle credit cards, receipt books, touch the computer, touch her mouth. You get the point, her hands weren't clean. The marg tasted like a store bought mix and it was not hot, none of their hot sauce were hot. Food was okay. My meal was $25 and not worth it. I ate at an authentic mexican spot the night before for $11 in black canyon. The entire location of this restaurant felt like a wantabe trendy campus. Hard pass next time. I realize this review makes me sound pretentious but I'm mainly just venting here cause I hate that I got suckered in to this place because I wanted a damn margarita!",

    "text": "I was really impressed with Diego pops. We went in for a late lunch and waited at the front door for a few minutes before being meet with someone who got us a table. It was busy. It seemed like there was no host and maybe they were short staffed. And then it took a while longer for the waitress to come over. The cool thing is that was the end of the problem. Our server was awesome. She was helpful even being busy. Being our first time she was helpful in explaining the menu and helping us select the right thing. Generally I'm a traditionalist when it come to Mexican food. This is not your typical Mexican place. I ordered shrimp taco. Chicken taco and a plantain taco. Even though the menu said recommended with corn she agreed with me that flour was a better option so I went with crunchy with the chicken like the menu suggested. It was awesome. As someone who loves salsa they brought out a basket of six toppings all cold and fresh. When the food came out it was cooked perfectly including the plantains. My significant other got a pork bowl with coconut rice that rocked my world too. I'm glad that it was large so she didn't finish letting me sample that as well. She loves pork with sweet flavor and this didn't disappoint the pineapple was a nice touch. It was Tuesday and generally I love my taco Tuesday but not here it's taco Monday. How cool is that now Monday can become the best day of the week with Diego's three dollar specials. It's a hip place but without the attitude. It's kind of like what burger rehab is to the cheese burger these guys are to the taco. One of my new favorite places. I highly recommend it and can't wait to give the. Another try to see if they can live up to my first experience. Hats off to the cooks who made a perfect meal. My one complaint is the Coke beverages seemed a little flat which is surprising from a place that appears to pay attention to the details.",

Tacos are decent size for the cost, great flavors, and a basket of amazing house made sauces are at every table.  Loved the shrimp, green chili chicken, and salmon.  I highly recommend getting at least of the tacos in the flour tortilla as it's amazing and handmade.  Drinks are decent, but food is great.  Cons: Service was confusing and aloof.  I asked for a recommendation and I got a long, twisted response with no actual suggestion.  Also, the waiter forgot to put in our order for appetizer.    Overall a place to try for sure!",

But they take their time, go do something else, insist on telling you all about the menu after you said you'd first like to get a happy hour margarita and then finally you say \"Can you make sure to get our order in while its still happy hour?\" and as she asks to see the time on your phone it clicks from 5:59 to 6:00 and she says instantly says \"Sorry, too late\"  and you say \"Seriously?\" And she says \"Sorry, no. It's over\"  I pointed out that we were there with plenty of time, had told her, and the hostess, we wanted happy hour and that it turned to 6:00 while she looked at my phone.   \"You can come back another time\" was her response.   Yeah, that feeling.   From now on : Loco Patron or El Hefe. Because, Diego, \"Sorry, it's over\".  UPDATE: This has been lowered to one star.  \"Meta\" asked me to contact them, I took the time to write an email with more detail and \"Meta\" couldn't be bothered to acknowledge or reply.

The ONLY reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because you have to pay for chips and salsa and that their guacamole sucks.   Recommend all the tacos, but specifically the beef Machaca",

On food and atmosphere I'd like to give them 4 stars, but on service 1-2 stars. I've been twice, the worst was the last time when we went with our friends well behaved children (6 and 9 year old). As far as I know children are allowed, but they made us feel unwelcomed. We had to wait for a table, no biggie, but the bartender was extremely rude to us, like staring at us while she spoke about us. Once seated the service was OK, but the waitress charged us for tacos that they made incorrectly for the kids (we asked for plain steak tacos, got them with everything). We were at the point we just wanted to get out of there so didn't even say anything. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, mostly the rude service, which I see from other reviewers they have also experienced. 50/50 on if we would ever go back.",

It's got corn, oaxaca cheese, roasted brussels sprouts, pickled onion, chili, pink sauce (roasted garlic beet crema) & fried egg. My boyfriend and I also ordered the steak bowl with creamy pinto beans. It was good! the combination of the house coleslaw adds crunchiness and the grilled onion compliments the steak! I came back to celebrate my birthday with my classmate and we ordered tacos and the brussels sprout nachos. I was not a big fan of their tacos. I got the shrimp taco, braised pineapple pork and the adobo bbq chicken. The only taco I liked was the shrimp taco. The pork and the adobo chicken was alright. I want to try the crispy cod and plantain next time. My classmates enjoyed the brussels sprout nachos, they said they'll come back for more.",

I ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito and a small side of skirt beef that took about 30 minutes to arrive and when it did it was cold, furthermore, after bringing our food we were not even offered silverware! Food was mediocre and service was beyond terrible. My friend and I had to ask for water since it was never offered to us and not once were we asked if we wanted something to drink.

Now for the food. The menu is.simple but the chefs suggestions are spot on. I had fish, carne asada and chicken tacos. All were top notch. I highly recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and tasting the unique flavors.",

Drinks and food were above average and we love the variety of sauces they bring out for you. Try the nachos with the Brussels Sprouts they are amazing.",
