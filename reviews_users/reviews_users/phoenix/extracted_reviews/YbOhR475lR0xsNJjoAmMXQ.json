I was strolling along beautiful downtown Phoenix and asked an officer for a decent place to eat and one of his choices was this place.  Most of the people walking around were headed to watch the Suns game at U.S. Airways arena so this place wasn't crowded. My waiter Ray recommended the Turkey Club and it was fantastic. I almost couldn't get enough of it. Came with a side salad. Lots of TV's and a great place to be.  Also right in front of the light rail train system, which took me directly back to my hotel.   Perfect location, great food and great service.",

I have ate here over 100 times but the cold beer before a baseball game is by far my favorite part. Don't forget they give you 15% off to season ticket holders.",

Problem was I could see into the kitchen, beyond the little curtain thing they had up... well I noticed what appeared to be a hispanic guy (shorter stocky build, long dark hair pulled back into kind of a tail) wearing a hat backwards. He reaches into his lower lip and pulls out what appears to be a big wad of chew. Now I don't have a problem with people chewing tobacco but in the kitchen working over the grill? he turned right back around and kept working on the grill. Never saw him leave to wash his hands. He was not wearing gloves. Then he walks around the other side and starts handling what appear to be hamburger buns in baskets awaiting to be prepped and sent out to customers. Nasty man....nasty. have some care and consideration for the people who eat what you touch!",

This corner of downtown does not get as much love as it deserves on non game/event days [TGI Fridays is across the street] But it is at those times where folks like me like to come hang out. [As you can guess I am not much for crowds.]   It is conveniently located on the 3rd St and Jefferson lightrail stop (an eastbound station) or just few short blocks walk south from the 3rd St and Washington lightrail stop (a westbound station).   So if you are one of those like me who likes to do the occasional lightrail pub crawl with friends make sure to add this to your list.    The booze is cold and their menu is pretty hot.  Hot in that it has some great items to choose.  My personal favorites are the nachos (those chips are awesome) add the beef or chicken and it just makes this plate of nachos much more yummy.  They make their own cheese sauce, it is not some yellow/orange glop they give you at a sporting event or movie.  Their burgers rock! Their salads woah.  But I still like their Mediterranean Hummus with the cool crisp veggies.  They have partnered with Mountainside Fitness to create a portion of the menu that is both tasty and healthy and I have to say it lives up to both.  The service has been excellent and I have never had an issue even at it's busiest.",

The place was packed with people and very loud as to be expected, lots of sports memorabilia and TV's so you can keep up on what game is being played. They have a decent beer list, not a tremendous amount of craft beers but they have the most popular beers and a full bar. We choose to share the bacon burger which was good, not the best burger I've ever had but good. Bits of bacon were cooked in the burger so you get the essence of bacon flavor but you can't really see it. For an extra $3.00 we ordered the onion rings which were greasy and not worth the extra money. My husband noticed they had fried Twinkies for dessert and had to have it. Since I'm not a big Twinkie fan to me it was just okay but my husband loved it and bragged to every on how much better it was then getting it at the fair since it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate and caramel syrup drizzled on top.",

To top it off, one of the owners/managers, we believe he said that his name was John, it was really loud, so we couldn't quite hear it, gave us the biggest laugh, when my husband thought that he was Andy, so he handed him our bill and credit card, and said \"oh, I am sorry, I thought that you were our waiter.\" The man said, no worries, and continued walking on his way down the street, but then he immediately turned around and came back- Mind you there was NOTHING that said \"hey, I am supposed to be here\" on this mans clothes, hat, nothing. He said, Oh I'll take that for you... .which was met with a \"ummmm, nooo..\" The best experience at a bar and grill - EVER!",

    "text": "Great location, right next to Chase Field and right in front of a light rail stop. The atmosphere is an upscale/trendy sports bar. Plenty of TV's if you can't get into the game. The food is amazing. Mac n cheese with chicken is a must, along with their Lobster bisque that is more like a chowder with chunks of lobster in it. Burgers were dynamite -  juicy inside, slighty crisp outside, with bacon and bacon mayo (Holy Bacon burger). Nice briosche bun that they brand teh top of with 'CC'.  The bar and drinks is top shelf. Drink menu is creative, all named after a major league baseball team. My fiance drank the 'Cincinnati' all night, named Pete's Punch after Pete Rose. I had beer and teh El Pres margarita made with Herradura reposado and a side blanco shot.  The staff is friendly and fun. we spent 5 hours there on Saturday night and never were rushed or hurried. Everyone was smiling and having a good time. Our waitress stayed and talked with us for a while even when we were just winding it down before driving home. We can't wait to go back and share this place with friends!!",

Okay, maybe not *breakfast* exactly - we'd closed down a pub at 0200 and were calling the desk at 0300 to verify checkout time, but I digress.  So around noon on a Sunday we stopped in at Coach's. I love its feel of a local joint that may have been around for 50 years. The service was terrific from the hostess, the waitress, generally everyone we observed.  For a small sports bar which has certainly not been around for 50 years, the food is phenomenal! I have a weak spot for lobster bisque, and theirs is outstanding. Good and thick with the usual small chunks, as well as what had to be an intact seventeen pound slab.  Fish tacos - the young lady ordered these. I had one many hours later, and it was cold, but it was delicious.  In what universe would you expect to find \"Hatch Chile Mac & Cheese\" in a sports bar??? Very filling and so, so tasty. I took about half of it home and yes, it's good cold, too.  Bloody Marys were perfect. Heinekens were frosty.  Note to self: Add Coach's to list of favorite downtown establishments!",

There was obviously a game going on (everyone in jerseys and team shirts), but we came in in the middle of a video game convention and I was dressed up with a wig and everything. Not only did I get stares and whispers, but our food took forever to order. I ordered their famous lobster bisque and my boyfriend got a burger. We waited about 30 minutes for our food, my bisque was at room temperature and my boyfriend got a super overcooked burger when he asked for a medium and it was really dry. The salad wasnt bad, but the pork belly on his burger wasn't flavorful and way too thick. Won't be coming back to this restaurant again, this is the second time in downtown Phoenix where we got poor service. Maybe were just unlucky?",

We asked what awards the lobster bisque had won and the response was \"whatever award we printed online, but I assure you the soup is spot on\".  Plus one for you, barkeep.  The lobster bisque was excellent which is surprising for a sports bar.  I also had the pork belly burger which was pork belly on top of a burger with some pineapple.  A winning combination.  Thank you Coach's for salvaging our evening.",

When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were happily greeted by many employees. It was very welcoming.  It seemed to be busy but that did not stop our waiter from bringing everything out super quick. We quickly got our beers minutes after we ordered. We were told our food would not be out for about 20-25 minutes, which was not a problem. 10 minutes later, our food was ready. It was absolutely delicious! Great portions and the burgers were fantastic. I will definitely be coming here again the next time I am in that area!",

After being seated we basically weren't assigned a server. Waited 15 mins for a beer, finally flagged someone down. Got our beers....still no server. I finally flagged down the manager and explained the situation. He was awesome! Took our orders, assigned a server, who also couldn't have been nicer to us after discovering the mix up in assignments ...which I understand happens. What I was SUPER impressed by was how quickly they took care of us after that, excellent customer service. Top it off with some VERY yummy burgers, buying us a round of beers for our inconvenience, we ended up having a wonderful experience. I'll definitely return and recommend to others!",

This is their idea of a sports bar? We asked the staff to turn up something/anything but they didn't know how to work the sound system and had to wait for the manager to come in later. No drink menus available. Mac n cheese was cold and dry. Chili cheese fries tasted old, only part of the fries that was warm was from the microwaved chili and cheese on top. Chili tasted very sweet, like mostly ketchup. I wish we could get that hour back. Oh and once the manager arrived, still no sound. So strange to come to a silent sports bar and hear everyone's conversation and the baby crying in the corner. Plus the manager decided to take a smoke break with one of the patrons as soon as he came in for his shift. This place is probably still going only because of its convenient location before and after a sports event. Set the bar low for this place and you'll be fine.",

Service was ok, for being busy it was understandable,  Food was really good, had a burger and fries, and the kids had the pretzel sticks appetizer.  Pretzel was tasty, soft and warm, dipping sauce lacked flavor.  The burger however was excellent.  Why only 3 stars...the bathroom.  It smelled like a toilet in the toilet.  I'm a realist, and didn't expect roses, but the floor was wet, the iced trough was old school, and the smell of pee strong.  And this is right next to the entrance to the kitchen.  It's a sports bar so perhaps there were a lot of misses, but still...it was bad.",

I said sure. 10 minutes later, I flagged down the waitress and told her to forget it. Took too long to be served. At that point, I just wanted to finish and get my check. Then, Even though there was food on my plate, and I was still eating, another employee reached for my plate and asked if I was done. I wasn't, but enough was enough.  Went to the bar to pay, gentleman sitting asked how was everything. Told him food was great, but service was horrible. Didn't know he was one of the owners. He offered to comp the meal. I thanked him, but said that wasn't necessary. I spent 30 years in the restaurant business. If the crew is hustling  and restaurant is busy, I'll wait forever. But there was no excuse for tonight. Reaching for my plate is inexcusable. Good, good. Service. No.",

This is about the 3rd time this has happened. And they literally removed the best two items from the menu - the bacon burger and the cajun wings. We asked why, and waiter said, \"getting ready for baseball season\". Really? The remaining selection is small and expensive. I will admit what they still offer is good, generally speaking. But this is an expensive sports bar with limited selection. I know a lot of people who have written this place off, and I'm reluctantly afraid that I may have to join them, not that they care.",

    "text": "Came here to watch the Super Bowl after we were told that their restaurant was promoting a deal of $100/person for reserved table seating and $50/person for bar seating. We asked the hostess prior to committing to seats if they planned to pack the bar with people and were told that they were only going to allow as many people in the restaurant as there were seats and the reasoning for the high price per seat, which instantly had us sold to watch the game there.  Low and behold, right before kickoff a flood of people come in and crowd the bar area which we would later find out those folks only had to pay a $10 cover for standing room. This really wouldn't have bothered me so much except for the group of  people standing behind us who were heckling us to the point where it was making me incredibly uncomfortable.  I finally had to get up and talk to the staff about the inappropriate behavior by the customer and False advertising by them. Their explanation was that the manager made a last minute change and decided to start offering the $10 standing room cover charge instead. It would be one thing if we were told that they would open it up to standing room later, but that wasn't the case.  As for the food and drinks - I actually really enjoyed all that we ordered.  The bartenders were all friendly and quick to get our drinks refilled.  I do applaud the staffs efforts in monitoring the situation after my complaints, but that did nothing to change the fact that they did not deliver on the Super Bowl experience they had advertised to customers who paid for seats.  I'm sure on any other day this is a great spot to grab some food and drinks.",

They have a good assortment of beers and the food is typical bar food.  The service was very good and the one special thing about this place is you could meet someone famous.  I met Tony LaRussa who is the VP Player Operations or something like that for the Diamondbacks, but I know him from his St. Louis Cardinal days. Well, I don't know him like we are buddies, but know of him while he was with the Cardinals.  We also saw Eric Young, Sr. who was with LaRussa in the same bar.  He was a player for the Dodgers and hit the very first home run in Rockies history during the very first at bat in Rockies Franchise history in which he hit it at the old Mile High Stadium back in 1993 before Coorsfield was built.  Young was a Rockies players not a Dodgers player at that time.  Anyway, the place is nice and good place to go to meet a friend and have a beer.",

Until another dude stands next to you to also use the trough and has to start the sword fight, man.  Get two normal urinals and this place gets 10 stars!",

The same company also has a new taco bar concept down the street, but they decided to have a grand opening closed door party instead of letting 20,000 concert attendees access. Dumb decision. This bar was decent - it used to be at a different location. Most of the food prices seemed jacked up a few dollars, but we split a large Philly, so we won the battle in the end. Very good quality ribeye steak with provolone and onions served on a very soft roll. The hand cut french fries also were the co-stars of the show. The bartenders were nice and friendly and it still makes way more sense to eat outside of Talking Stick because the food choices inside are not of this quality at all and had even higher prices.",

Good to see some local beers on tap so swigged down something bartender brought when I asked for something dark, but in such a hurry I couldn't recall what it was, but bartender was sure correct in it being tasty. Wings had a sweet and lightly spicy barbecue flavor and were crisp yet juicy and very enjoyable. I appreciated the super quick service and honesty when I needed it and when I saw the burgers go by they looked good, so hope to return for a more leisurely visit.",

The visit turned into an exercise of trying to wave down someone to take orders, get drinks, and even napkins. One time, we were looking to try something local and finally got someone, only for them to tell us that they couldn't answer our questions cause he was only a runner. By our count, there was 2 servers, 1 runners, and 1 bartender for a place filled with people.

There only one other person eating when we got there. We ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, great choice. Ordered the High Cheese, Texas Leaguer and the Bambino Burgers. Everything was top-notch and flavorful. The salad, the fries and the burgers were outstanding. You can tell that a great deal of thought, preparation and presentation went into the meal selections on the menu. Other places have a large selection of blah food that leaves you unimpressed. This is Not that place. The menu is smaller, but is focused on intensely flavorful, unforgettable selections. Any selection you make is a win-win. If you need a non-formal, family-friendly sports bar restaurant that will still impress business clients, this is it. Even my 14 year old son says this is the best burger he has ever had and thats saying alot. This is now our go-to burger spot",

We were seated and immediately served by a nice and attentive waitress. So far so good.   I kinda liked the vibe in here, and beer is beer and we didn't have any complicated drink orders in addition. Drinks came fast and correctly. Still good this far.   The crowd drawn from the heavy metal band that was starting in hours, had the place packed with the metal crowd and they are always an awesome bunch.   We ordered food, and again not much wait - waitress on par, fast and sweet through the whole ordeal. But that's where our good times took a turn. Every meal order, although correct, was quite bad. I didn't expect much - not from this kind of place - so my bar was already set low, and somehow the food limbo'd underneath said bar.

However, if you're getting margaritas be forewarned that they'll charge you $1 extra for margarita mix! Seriously had I known that beforehand, I would have just gotten straight up tequila.",

I had another customer throw a plastic glass at me after slamming his drink and when I approached him he told me to move on! When it was brought to managements attention I was told to leave because I was only with a party of 2 and not 4-6 that he was with. He was in the wrong but yet I was told to leave. So sad!!! God Bless America!!! I'll never recommend this place to anyone ever!!! And yes I'm a Veteran who served our country!! This was the great management that I was dealing with!!",

Sadly, much has changed. Upon arrival and inspection of the menu it was disappointing to see the entire menu appeared to have changed. Wait staff confirmed this. My favorite steak salad, which was awesome, was gone, along with other great grub. So with that said, I settled for the power salad.  While waiting, a look throughout the joint and one could see they were short on customers today, like dead quiet. This was a pleasant sight as this establishment usually can be busy. I mention this given I expected to get good service given no one else was there. Sadly, not the case. Grub took some time and finally came out. I had asked for egg to be added to salad, ya that didn't happen. The overall taste of the salad was pretty good but there was little to no chicken. For every 15 bites, maybe a little chicken was to be had. Friends ordered soups that they claimed were subpar and another Philly cheesesteak not only lacked any meat but tasted poor. It had to be sent back. The icing on the cake for me was trying a new beer I was excited about and having it sent out warm. How disappointing. Overall, was frustrated given I selected Coach's Corner for my group to have good and drink and it was less than an average experience. I may try the joint again given past experiences but it may be time to find better downtown eats before ball games.",

    "text": "As a loyal customer and business owner I have to say that Coaches Corner WAS one of my favorite places to go to have a nice beer after a very stressful day at the office. Unfortunately though I have decided to go elsewhere now. The reason being that I do not like how employees handle themselves in stressful situations.   For instance, I came in one day and overheard the manager Garret mistreating some of the employees. One employee had made a mistake and so instead of taking the employee to the back to discuss, he proceeded to yell and embarrass this employee.   Ultimately to me, a business owner, that is extremely poor management. Not only was the employee being mistreated, I EVEN felt uncomfortable!! If there is one way to drive away customers, it's doing exactly that! This is not the first time I've seen Garret do something like this either. It's happened multiple times to different employees.   I'm no expert, but bullying and harassing someone for an error they've made is an extremely poor way to, A: handle business, B: keep employees, and C: keep your customers!! I was appalled by Garrets' behavior and will never return to Coaches Corner again.",

Well, Coach's Corner is directly across the street and super convenient, so we popped in to check it out.  We were seated immediately by a nice hostess. It's a pretty big place, with plenty of seating and a large bar. They had a really good beer selection, and all of the food sounded tasty.  They didn't have any specials for the night, but they were offering tots for $5. I love me some tots, and I HIGHLY suggest ordering these if they are on the menu when you visit. They came out in a small sliver bucket and it was a HUGE serving. The tots were covered in nacho cheese, sour cream, bacon and chives. Holy crap were they amazing!  My friend ordered the chicken fingers with fries and they were surprisingly really good as well. You could tell that the fingers were made in house and not frozen from a package, and the fries seemed to be fresh cut as well.  I was pretty stuffed after a long day of eating a beer drinking, so I only ordered the Trio DIp - which was chips with salsa, guacamole and bean dip. Everything was fresh and tasty.  The prices were very reasonable, considering the location. The service was very friendly as well. I thought it would be a total tourist trap, but was pleasantly surprised. I definitely suggest stopping in before or after a game!",

We waited SO long for our food that I became sick from having an empty stomach and all the people smoking cigarettes just a few feet away.   We all got a coach burger with different toppings and the waitress had no idea which one was which. Nobody brought us napkins and the bathrooms were not well kept.   The food was not impressive.

The friendly staff, lead by Manager Daron make you feel welcomed the second you walk into the place. Coaches Corner is in the center of all the action. Only steps away from both Chase Field, the Convention Center and US Airways Center. What I like about the place is you can get some really unique menu items such as the best Lobster Bisque soup I ever tasted, or their homemade mozzarella sticks. You got to try it yourself  to appreciate their eclectic menu.  This is the perfect place to go if you're heading to a game, concert, or an event at the Convention Center. Just step off the light rail stop. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",

They are real fries just cut potatoes and fried perfectly. We also ordered cheese to go with the fries. They were the best fries we have had in a while.   They reminded me of a little place back home called the Hot Dog Shoppe.   The food was fantastic, the service was ok. They weren't great about keeping our drinks filled or checking on is but the food made up for it.   They offer a discount to D-Backs season ticket holders. Unfortunately we completely forgot until after we payed. We will have to use our discount next time.",

It was wings a small pizza and 2 chicken sandwiches. Just about cancelled when it came out. The staff was helpful they just the kitchen wasn't ready for a rush even though it's downtown Phoenix.  The two star was solely for the staff.   #notagain",

It's on the corner located by the Chase Field and just down the way from the basketball stadium.   This bar is super cool with its decor. The staff is fantastic! They are So nice, plus they are cool. I enjoyed hanging out here because the atmosphere is fun! People are talking to each and you're not being judged by others. You can come here to relax and chill and have a fun time. Also One of the owners Jeff is a super cool dude. It was great meeting him.",

They have a decent beer selection and the food is also really good. Last time we stopped in I had their dry rub wings and they were actually very good. I'm from the Midwest and as a bit of a wing snob, I was pleasantly surprised. We stopped in AGAIN after the game and I had their chicken strips which were delicious. Battered to perfection!  The hubby had a burger and said it was amazing.  The burger was huge and looked nice and juicy.  Highly recommend this place whether you are going before a game or even if you are just in the area. The staff has always been really nice and if you're lucky, Baxter will make an appearance.",

Each member of the crew went above & beyond for us & were very accommodating. Our wait staff kept our drinks filled, checked on us frequently, & kept the food coming at a great pace. They certainly deserve lots of kudos for their superior customer service & they would like to host all our future holiday parties from here on out!   The food was very tasty! I had the Hatch Chili Mac. It was very delicious mac & cheese with a chili twist. The portion size was perfect for me. I was content & not stuffed afterward. I recommend trying this meal!   If you're looking for a great place to watch sports, have some lunch or dinner, or just a great place to have drinks with the crew, give Coach's Corner a try!",

Also, after showing 10% off bill voucher (from convention), the manager wouldn't take it!  Would not recommend this place to anyone! Shitty service, mod-high prices! It seemed they were only interested in watching the Titans vs. Patriots game!!!!",

Back to my table of desolation.  A gent named Corey introduced himself and asked if I would mind moving as a party of 28 was coming in.  Told him it was all good as long as I could see the hockey game.  Service did not improve.  I would flag down any server that looked my way, but still took forever to get anything.  Sandwich came and it was tasty.  Corey came by again to ask who my server was.  Said I didn't know.  He asked if I'd been paying cash.  I told him, no I haven't paid anything.  Ordered another beer with 5 mins left in the game.  Game over, no beer, no server.  Approached the bar to pay the tab.  Guess who I get?  Rude guy!  Shoos me away and tells me to go pay my server.  I was here a few weeks ago, food was great and service was better, but I don't think I'll waste my time again.",

Oh and we had her both visits same day. We all order waters to start because we were dehydrated, we then ordered our alcohol beverages and in the meantime one of the managers who was also rude as can be came over and asked us \"so are you guys all just going to drink waters or what\"?

    "text": "This wasn't where I wanted to go for happy hour before the Dbacks game but it was hot & my friends didn't wanna walk & this was close. After grabbing our own drink menu, waiting too long to place our order & again for the drinks to arrive, I was giving my crew the \"you should've listened to me!\" face. And then a manager walked over & said, \"You had to wait too long for your drinks & that shouldn't happen. I want you to have a good experience here.\" Already my mood improved because bad service is so common but having acknowledged? Wow! He comped us two delicious appetizers - nachos w/ shredded beef (the cheese sauce obviously, addictingly house-made) and chicken tenders w/ fries (loved the light, crispy batter on the chicken!) And, yeah, even my cocktail - slow though it was to get to me - was a really good drink. The manager saved our repeat business. We'll definitely try it again. The food & beverages were worth the visit & hopefully they'll smooth out the service kinks, too, to become a downtown fixture.",

    "text": "I ate at a few places during Phoenix Comicon 2014. I have to say that Coaches Corner Grill was the best spot. Saturday after 7pm only waited about 5 minutes. They got slammed by our group and a group that included the Hulk and some DOZD. There were paramedics called outside during dinner so that was interesting. Because of how busy it was and the large parties, food took close to an hour but with the conversation and our server being very attentive it felt like no time at all. The mac and cheese is amazing, the wings are hearty and delicious, and they have a bacon CRUSTED burger that was awesome too. The only thing to improve would be to serve the beer colder. That being said, I still give this place five stars. The reason that this gets five stars and not four is because unlike some bar food this food tasted great and did not do a conga line through me within an hour, like most bar food.  It will be a Con regular outing for years to come.",

Looked like the Mgr. was trying to help.  There was a Civic Center event of some sort.  We drove from Chandler to try it out..  To top it off we had to sit at the bar next to a couple that looked homeless and was sharing a beer.   Gave it 3 stars just because of Coach and Willies respect.",

You always have to be careful on Sunday because some bars can be very home team and not open to visiting teams.   This place wasn't like that. The staff wasn't the most happy to serve me, but they warmed up to me, what I liked about this place was the environment. They are very interactive with guests, bells going off, tossing out free stuff every once in a while. They even have the teams playing below each TV which is a simple enough concept that I would think more people would use it.   Their menu was hit and miss for me. I had the cheese sticks which were awesome, but I had the Italian sub for lunch and it was less than great. Still, I'd imagine the rest of the food is good because there were lots of things I saw later which I thought \"I SHOULDVE HAD THAT!\" The liquor was a bit pricey for a game day, in my opinion. Stick with beer here.   Overall if I had a chance to go back I definitely would but I'd pick my food differently, only reason it's 3 stars is because what I had wasn't mind blowing or anything like that.",

    "text": "For a sports bar to succeed, they have to understand their clientele. They must get that a bevvy of different tastes will walk through their door; from the deep pocketed to those expecting deals any given time. I feel Coach's really hits a home run and understands...so lets steal home and discuss Coach's Corner Grill:  ~Fud/Drink~ Right off the bat, this place is so close to Chase Field I could literally throw a baseball and hit an entry gate. So, given that, you would think they price things up. NOPE! Happy Hour, right before the game!! I was relieved to find good prices on beer and some appetizer specials to munch on. This alone compels me to return next time I go to a game. The drink specials were good, as were the selection of beers. The food looks a tad above par a general sports bar. They have a variety of choices, general bar fare done up a tad. I will get a bite to eat next time, but the people I was sitting around enjoyed their food, no complaints I could hear of. Looking over the menu, I know for sure I will definitely return to try a meal next time.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The barkeep we had was pretty busy with all the fans in the bar, yet he kept a smile the entire time and was very talkative to me and all the Orioles fans who stopped in. Fun guy, took his time on the orders with all of us at the bar and did not ask every 5 seconds if I needed an extra one. I asked about food options next time I came in, and he was very knowledgeable about items on the menu, and pointed out his favorites. It is a smaller space, however, and this place I am sure fills up quick on weekend games. It isn't overly homely, the bar is long enough and they have walls covered with various memorabilia. Its nothing to write home about, but this isn't an issue with great service.  ~Extras/Rating~ Only extra I have is to get here early, especially on weekends. I highly recommend this bar. This bar beats any alternatives nearby, and is so close to Chase. They get 4 stars for good prices, fun and upbeat service, variety of food choices, and location to Chase Field. They \"lose\" a star for lack of space and ambiance. Really, those two factor out to a 4 star location in my mind, and a solid addition to the bar scene for the DBacks games.",

    "text": "Just left the restaurant and I must say we were so looking forward to have a great meal, but ended up very disappointed. Visited during the Volleyball Festival and they were severely understaffed for the large number of folks dining in. So we were often left tracking down our server for attention.   The menu looks great. We were hoping for much more than what we received for our meals. First, ordered pretzel bites from the menu as our appetizer and had to have our waiter check on them. Unfortunately, what we received AFTER our dinner arrived were two large pretzels and watered down cheese sauce. I had the chicken club, which was under seasoned. The french fries were good though. Husband had the burger, which he said wasn't anything great, and daughter had spaghetti with meatballs, again just okay.   After waiting for our server to bring us our check, was pleased that he removed the pretzel charge due to the oversight. Just done a little too late to redeem the poor service we received.   Left disappointed and irritated. Won't be back. Sorry...",

    "text": "BUSY is the one word to describe this establishment on a Dbacks game day. Seriously first stop headed E on the way to the stadium on the light rail. It's like a beacon of refreshment of chilled cocktails & cold beer on a 107 day in the PHX. I'm happy to report they had ample seating/standing inside & a misted shaded outdoor patio & handled the large crowd like pros which is more than can be said for quite a few places around Chase Field. So that's why they get 4 stars even without me trying a bite of food. I have to admit though after perusing a menu it just looked like typical bar fare nothing to flood the calorie gates for. So I can't say I'll be doing that any time soon but definitely enjoyed the atmosphere, crowd & quick service.",

The manager apologized and bought us a beer. That was nice of him but I hope the bartender will work on his \"people\" skills.   The place wasn't very busy, an hour or so, after a Dbacks game. We didn't eat. I've heard good things about the food. Baldy Bartender put a downer on us wanting to stay longer.  I do like that they have a few tvs. There was no way that I was going to ask the bartender to change the station, lol.",

Now this is no measly dish, huge chunks of lobster in an amazing sauce. To die for. I also got the brisket chilli. The sweet, smoky, and spicy flavors were so bold it was heaven for my palette. My friend got the buffalo Mac and cheese. So amazing with nice sized chunks of breaded buffalo chicken, bleu cheese crumbles and all around amazingness.   Our server Paul was amazing. Super nice. Helped us out with suggestions. And was right on for what I wanted even though I had no clue. You better check out this place when you are in downtown Phoenix!!",

My former manager and I came here because we could never eat lunch together when we worked in the same office. She ordered the Italian beef and raved about it. I, clearly, ordered the bacon burger. It was fantastic, and seriously the bacon mayonnaise was to live for! What wasn't slathered on my burger was perfect for dipping fries. It's a condiment that would compliment any meal.",

They have great local beers on tap with average downtown prices. In regards to the food, it has the potential of being very good, but every single food item we have ordered from here (on three separate visits) has come out cold. We ordered the nachos this last time, but their cheese sauce was cold, not even warm. This is a great spot for a drink though!",
