    "text": "What a fun spot! Came here on a Wed night out of the blue with the hubs & some friends. I have been wanting to stop in for quite a while, and I was glad to have the opportunity.  We were sat promptly, and water was on the table quickly. The menu was SO interesting to read, and immediately I found four or five items that sounded delicious. Being pregnant, I stuck with water, but the rest of the people at our table enjoyed some great beers of draft - they were happy with the selection.  For dinner I ordered the Vegetable Chop salad & a side of the bacon cheddar biscuits. ( How could you NOT order something that fabulous?) Hubs ordered the Pork Osso Buco Confit (and yes, I did have to go to Beckett's website to get that name, no way I was remembering that on my own.) Two others at our table ordered the Cast Iron Chicken & Chicken Meatballs.   Before we knew it, our orders were at the table. They LOOKED delicious, and from the first bite we weren't disappointed. The pork my husband ordered was nothing short of incredible, and my salad was the perfect size & well proportioned (I hate when you are overloaded with too much lettuce and not enough veggies.) Our table mates devoured their meals - not giving us a bite, which was understandable.  For dessert we ordered a Peanut Butter Smores milkshake. Oh my richness-heavenly-milkshakeland. That milkshake definitely brings the boys to the yard. Oh, and it came with a chocolate covered strip of bacon. Are you kidding me? Awesome.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Our visit to Beckett's Table has been a long time coming given the buzz and hype, but we finally got there last night.  Normally I would visit a few times before doing a review but after 6 courses with wine pairings I feel justified in sharing our first impressions.    Frankly there wasn't anything I would have changed.  The urban atmosphere was our style - open kitchen, community table, warm welcome and appropriate attention from Chef Beckett, the wait staff and bartender.  The food was inspired - bold combinations of local ingredients, artfully plated and presented with pride.  The prices were good (I don't understand the reviews that say otherwise (?)...).    We started with a Pimm's Cup at the bar.  It tasted just like our favorite Napoleon House Pimms in New Orleans - made with ginger ale and Sprite.  We then joined our friends at the community table for a multi-course meal with wine pairings from Arizona's Sand-Reckoner vineyards.  The winemakers were with us so we were able to get a play-by-play along the way. We had:  * heirloom tomatoes, crow's dairy feta, shaved carrots, baby herbs, evoo and goat quark * tomato powder seared shrimp, black & white organic barley, \"first of the season\" ramps, green garlic chips, hearts of fire, white beets, seabeans and schrienders bacon * mac-n-cheese with pancetta (we added this dish after we saw it ordered by another table)  *rabbit tenderloin wellington, morrel mushroom duxelle, wild rice * chocolate torte, dark chocolate ice cream, quince reduction * beckett's original grilled cheese with pancetta and tomato soup (for the ride home)  Everything was super good.  And we had a lot of fun.  That's what sharing a meal with friends is all about! If you like great food, created with love and served with passion I strongly suggest you give Beckett's Table a try.  We'll be back.",

For the longest time, I've always caught myself ready to make reservations to this place on a Monday- the only day the restaurant wants to be closed -_-  Finally, I go with two friends and we sit down hungry and eager to try the food that was filling the place with such a nice aroma of flavors. Then our server came to our table and everything started going downhill from there. We told him it was our first time coming after he had asked..his response was \"ok well....................do you guys want to start off with a drink?\" hahah we were all like...why did you even ask if there wasn't going to be some sort of reciting of dinner specials or even a short welcome? We brushed it off because, of course, we were there to eat. The server was, again, no help at all when we asked about what he recommended. Ended up getting the Chopped salad, Short ribs and Shrimp dish to share. I thoroughly enjoyed the chopped salad- thought it was refreshing with various textures that allowed for a burst of flavor in my mouth. The other dishes were a bit of a disappointment to all three of us...once we finished, we payed...then left.   I was hoping to enjoy it but sadly, dont think I'll want to come back",

I went to experience the 5 stars everyone else talked about but ended up just going to get my grease on (though it was topped off with an amazing desert!) in a great looking place.   I really struggled with beet appetizer...didn't realize it would be served hot and I generally take a description for it's word on it's ingredient list but I was straining to find any feta cheese and eventually found a couple small melted white specks among the beets. Nevertheless it was tasty...  Of course I couldn't not order  bacon, cheddar biscuits but the vision of them  melting in my mouth was replaced with crunchy greasy salty bits. Not awful...but there was wilted angst toward that basket thought should have contained a True sin biscuit. In addition I was wholeheartedly disappointed in the candied jalapeno orange butter - it was lacking both jalapeno and orange. *Sigh*  The main course of green chile stew was good but slighted due to the previous orderings...good corn bread though sparsely proportioned and heavy on the butter/oil . Again, the description included cotija cheese and there were literally 5 crumble pieces on top. My immediate thought was that this would be an amazing breakfast leftover addition and indeed it was!  I have to say that we were delightfully surprised by the coconut cake desert adventure - outstandingly good with brown butter ice cream!   Service and atmosphere were as previous reviews and worth another trip back though the drinks were very light on alcohol. I think the happy hour or Sunday special  deserve a chance and we'll likely be back to take another stab.",

Had an absolutely wonderful experience. The outdoor seating was comfortable even with it being 90+ degrees outside. Loved the wine selection, and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable on what to pair with food.   They were helpful in narrowing down a selection for me within my dietary restrictions-- and the meal I had was one of the best pieces of salmon I have ever had. Recommended this to the rest of the individuals in my training class!!",

Service was friendly and attentive. The bartenders really knew their wines - I listened in as they made recommendations for others.  We just nibbled on the Oven Roasted Root Vegetables and the Mac and Cheese with Pancetta, both of which were excellent.

Appetizers: The chicken salad deviled eggs were delicious, and I thought it was cool how you could order them by the egg for $2 each. The grilled cheese was literally AMAZING- glad I trusted the reviews on this one. However, I wasn't so impressed by the biscuits. I thought they were a little dry and wasn't a fan of the apple butter (honestly like one reviewer said Red Lobster has better biscuits LOL)  Entrees: I had the Tucson Shrimp. It was okay but I probably wouldn't order it again. My boyfriend felt the same way about his dish (the Fire Roasted Green Chile Pork Stew). However, the Fork Tender Short Ribs were literally AMAZING!  My only complaint is when making the reservation they didn't ask if we were celebrating a special occasion (it was my birthday, and I would expect a restaurant of this caliber to ask this).",

We were pleasantly surprised to be shown to a table as soon as we checked in.  We had a reservation, and I suspect we never would have gotten a table without one.    Our server, Pamela, and the other staff were clearly enthusiastic about the restaurant and executed the mechanics of the meal well.  Pamela seemed very knowledgeable about the menu items and about pairing beverages.  We enjoyed most of the items we ordered, especially the noshing board for two, the butter lettuce salad, tomato soup, and roasted smoked pork chop.  The pork stew was a bit of a disappointment.  It can with a large slab of corn bread that appeared intended to crumble into the stew.  However, it was not seasoned in an interesting way and did not add anything to the stew.  And we found the service a bit abrupt.  Our server and various food runners came and went so quickly  (without asking if we needed anything) that we had a hard time placing our initial drink order or requesting refills.  Slow down, people!!  We did enjoy the general atmosphere of the restaurant, which has the characteristic-of-Phoenix walls of windows that completely open to the outdoors.  The sound level inside the restaurant is quite high, so sitting outdoors when weather permits might be a good choice if you want to actually have a conversation while you dine.",

    "text": "I've been writing a lot of long reviews lately so I'll try to keep this one relatively short: I've been to Beckett's Table many times, and it is consistently one of the best restaurants in the Phoenix area.  The restaurant itself is very aesthetically pleasing. Rustic but modern, high ceilings but warm and inviting.  Plenty of green lining the patio and a fireplace in the corner.  If you were to repurpose a barn into a modern restaurant, it would look something like this - which fits very well with the restaurant's focus on fresh, seasonal foods.  The service is top notch.  The hosts and hostesses are friendly, always accommodating, and know how to make patrons feel welcome.  The servers are equally friendly and very knowledgeable when it comes to the cuisine on the menu.  I've had a different server every time I've dined at Beckett's Table and I have been equally impressed by the service experience on every occasion.  Service and decor aside, the food is what really sets this place apart from not only other restaurants in the Arcadia area, but many restaurants in the greater Phoenix valley.  Sophisticated American comfort food is the best way to describe the menu, and everything is fresh and seasonal.  Can't-miss items: Super-Creamy Grits & Schreiner's Sausage, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Deep-Fried Deviled Eggs, Signature Fork-Tender Short Ribs, and the Pork Osso Buco Confit.  For sides, don't pass up the Bacon Cheddar Biscuits, and for desert the Chocolate-Dipped Bacon S'mores are a must.  Remember, however, that because of the seasonal nature of the menu, the daily specials they run are always going to be fresh items and have the potential to be out of this world.  This place has become a favorite for my girlfriend and I, as well as our families.  It will continue to be as long as its doors are open.",

We asked for bread (btw -their butter is addicting!) and it came out nice and warm.  For our entree I ordered the pork chop and my friend ordered the short ribs.  Both were excellent. One small detail - our drink came out after we got our salad, but it was a minor detail -  we were just really thirsty :)  For dessert, we had the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores which were divine.

I was a vegetarian for quite some time (now eat seafood), so I must admit that my experience with the menu is somewhat limited. I've always loved the red pepper soup and grilled cheese, and I did enjoy the spaetzle on the two occasions I ordered it. I guess Beckett's sort of lost its sparkle because there weren't enough options to keep me interested.   I've visited Beckett's with others who have tried the other dishes on the menu and have complained that many of them are very \"hit or miss\" regarding taste and quality of preparation. I visited a few weeks ago with my boyfriend (he is on the fence about this restaurant) and we left, well... satisfied.   When it's good, it's VERY good. When it's not, it's just \"okay.\"   I really do like the owners and the concept. It's very cozy and has a pretty little patio.   :-D",

We were shown to our table and waited on with such attention that we almost couldn't believe it. Our water glasses never went empty, and we never sat for more than a few minutes without someone paying attention to us. The specialty cocktails were innovative, and the beer/wine list was very nice. And the food.... oh wow! We sampled the bread basket of cheddar biscuits, a chopped salad with all kinds of fresh veggies and a basil/champaigne vinaigrette, the 4-cheese grilled cheese & red pepper tomato soup appetizer, the savory cheddar bacon stuffing, and the extremely flavorful green chile pork stew. Don't let me stop there - the desserts were absolutely amazing. We shared the pecan fig pie, the coconut cake, and the chocolate bacon s'mores.

For starters we had the deep fried deviled eggs and peppers. Both were good but we all preferred the peppers.  After reading the reviews one of us had the short ribs another the oso buco and another the flat iron steak (not a lot of reviews) with a side order of the bacon cheddar biscuits. Everyone  enjoyed their meal. Only one person had the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores for dessert, they really enjoyed the twist on an old favorite.   The food is what you expect for an upscale comfort food restaurant.  We all left full but not stuffed. With 2 drinks our bill was $120.00.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place because I had heard great things from friends, but unfortunately my husband and I were disappointed in our experience.  We started off the night well with a warm and welcoming server. It felt as though they really appreciated their customers choosing to dine with them. Also, the decor was fantastic. We loved the open floor plan, wood beam ceilings, and the glassware.  For our appetizer, we ordered the \"Mac 'N' Cheese\" with crispy pancetta--delicious! We could have not been more pleased with that dish. It was delectable, but not heavy or greasy at all. The pancetta was perfection.  For drinks, my husband ordered the \"Legend City Cocktail\" which he said was great. I ordered \"Miss Katie's Pimms Cup\" (clearly one of the most girly drinks on the menu) and I really enjoyed it. So far, so good.  Then the main dishes. This is where Beckett's Table lost us. I ordered the \"Fork Tender Short Ribs\". They were okay, not awesome, and I have definitely had better at a few other places. The short ribs were tender enough but not well seasoned, and the vegetables were too raw and not cooked long enough. I was disappointed because I felt I could make the same dish, only better and cheaper, at home. My husband ordered the \"Chicken 'N' Dumplings\" which was also a let down. The chef did not add any salt or seasonings to the dish, so it was very bland. We thought it was possibly a mistake, so after adding enough salt to flavor, we mentioned it to the server. We felt like he was giving us a bit of story, because after some hesitation he said \"Oh well, maybe I didn't mention it, but this is one of our more mild dishes.\" Meh. Even if that is the truth, that doesn't make it any better of a dish. Also, the vegetables in it were hard--the carrots and celery should be tender, not crunchy and raw.  In the end, if we ever return to Beckett's Table it would be solely for cocktails, not food. Nice atmosphere, but the quality does not match up to the pricing.",

Place has a great vibe to it and we found food as good as the vibe.  The person taking the reservation could not have been nicer, and that waitstaff could not have been more helpful. My wife had the green chilli stew and I had the short ribs.  Both were wonderful. We went on Sunday and they price bottles of Arizona wine at half price so we took 1/2 a bottle home.  Only disappointment was the Patio seating. It had a lot of street noise and  the views were of a parking lot and the strip mall next door. Next time we will sit inside.",

Others had the salmon and they enjoyed it too. Upscale comfort food, with prices to match, but significantly better quality than normal restaurant comfort food.",

Yet again, the food was amazing.  I always judge restaurant experiences in stressful times (when because of volume, promotions, etc. things can easily slip) as well as quiet times (when things can be overlooked or just glossed over). Peg and I have been thrilled that nothing like that has ever happened in this place.  Kudos...once again!",

We started off with the grits which were very, very good. I'm glad I took someone up on that recommendation because I had never had grits before and felt pretty weary! But! Someone else was picking up the tab and I was feeling adventurous.   My father ordered the chicken and dumplings which were good, but I don't think I'd order it for myself in the future or recommend it to anyone. I ordered the grilled cheese with soup as my entree although it is normally served as an appetizer. I was just very full from the bread and grits.   Our server, Cole I think was his name, was very friendly and helpful. I really wanted to try the s'mores appetizer but I just didn't have room. Another excuse to go back soon, though!",

They went out of their way to make me, my friends, and my really late fourth at the table feel welcome and pampered.  The wine and scotch lists looked good to me, but I am not an expert in either. The bottled beer list was not perfect, but it was pretty close to it.  If there was a catch, it was that they delight in pork products--which is great for a bacon lover like myself, but not so great for one of my no-pork-please dinner partners. A note on the menu specifying that they can leave it out would really help. While I think they probably would, not everyone is comfortable asking for \"special treatment\" from the kitchen, and probably not every dish can be modified.   The seating doesn't really feel intimate, but you'll be so belly-warmed you won't notice.   Recommended: that chocolate-dipped bacon s'more is as good as it sounds.",

We had zero trouble making a reservation thru the Opentable app. We were greeted immediately when we walked in. We gave them our name and they sat us.   I had always thought this place was smaller, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's quite spacious. I loved the homey, living room-esque look of the seats along the east wall. Very cool.  Our waiter was great. Very energetic and knowledgable about the menu. We decided to share the grilled cheese app, the cast iron petite chicken, the pork osso buco confit, and the chocolate covered bacon s'mores for dessert.  Delicious overload! Everything was amazing. The grilled cheese was creamy and crunchy, and the red pepper tomato soup was devine. And I'm *not* a tomato soup fan. We may have looked ridiculous hovering over our chicken and pork dishes on one corner of our table, but man was it worth it. Sharing is caring kids! The chicken was my fave. Juicy and delicious and that bacon biscuit stuffing was great. The pork was a little salty for my personal taste, but it was still very good. It came off the bone wicked easily and I'm pretty sure I could've eaten an entire bowl of just the spinach speatzle that came w/ it.  And that dessert. Man. Rich, and sweet, and salty, and just the right amount.  All I can say is, you get what you pay for here. Amazing.",

I looked the menu on Opentable and the selection looked really interesting. I especially liked that there were several locally sourced items available so I made a 6:30 reservation. We arrived a little early and were promptly seated. The moment we sat down, there was someone there to poor water and our waitress followed right behind. She was very friendly and eager to answer any questions. Being unfamiliar with the menu, I checked out the reviews for different items on Yelp and ultimately decided to try the days deviled egg offering, which did not disappoint. For my dinner I chose the pork oso bucco and substituted mashed potatoes and my fiance enjoyed the short ribs. Both were incredibly tender to the point that it was difficult to use the fork. The flavor was amazing. My fiance chose the grilled cheese as his appetizer and he was equally impressed. I would highly recommend this place for a girls night, a date night or if you're just looking for a wonderful non-chain meal.",

It had very little variation in texture and was rather small (though all of us observed that the portions were small for the money). It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular, either.   I was still hungry afterward, as were my nearby companions. We were glad that someone else ordered biscuits and passed some down to us--WOW! Now those were amazing. Like a Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuit on steroids. Definitely high quality cheese and bacon mixed in. Plus, the biscuits were huge and divided well with a couple people.

    "text": "First of all, I have to clarify that my husband and I LOVE Beckett's Table, we usually come here for celebration meals for the two of us, on different occasions for the last 5 years. Always have great meal and good service depending on the wait staff.  Tonight, I was a little bit disappointed. Found out they won't split checks at the table for a group. So be prepared...  I recommended this restaurant for my friend's birthday celebration (because Beckett's is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix) and did not realize that they won't split the check at the table. We had to do the math ourselves in order to tell the waiter how much to charge on each card, and it was quite a messy deal with sales tax and \"suggested tip\" which was mandatory gratuity, kind of ruined a nice dinner at the end.   Waiter did help us figure out the sales tax and tip split in the end and charged us accordingly, but it was a pain to figure all that out after a nice meal and of course serious food coma.  Food is still amazing, but I will not recommend it for large groups ever again, we dropped well over $400 as a group, so I definitely won't recommend here especially for business groups. Guess after traveling all over the states and overseas, I was a little spoiled with most high end restaurants we visited were happy to split checks for large groups who spend large amount of money, and potentially come back for more.",

That being said, my wife and I ate here on Friday, June 10 and, while it's sad to report, the food left much to be desired. Our appetizers, the Deviled Egg of the Day and the Mac 'n Cheese were each completely devoid of any flavor. The same can be said for the Scottish Salmon and the grits. We found ourselves filling each of our dishes with salt just to bring some additional flavor to our plates. My wife's shrimp, from her shrimp and grits, were appropriately seasoned and enjoyable.  My fingers are crossed that Chef Beckett can figure out his food and take this restaurant back to what it was just a few months ago. We'll continue to dine and support local establishments and, once they've fixed their food, hopefully Beckett's table works its way back into our local rotation.",

The chef apparently has a thing for bacon--there were multiple dishes with bacon in them--even desserts! However, we chose the \"flourless chocolate cake\" as dessert, and to our surprise (and delight) they gave it it to us on the house after hearing it was our anniversary  :) it was rich and chocolatey!  Reasonably priced for the quality. Inside of restaurant had a very relaxed yet sophisticated vibe. If you live in the metro Phoenix area, you should definitely check this place out.   **Upon reading the menu, they have numerous gluten free options as well, for those of you who may have dietary limitations.",

She would touch back to the table every once in a while that didn't feel like we were being bombarded. Even the busers/runners were very friendly.   We started out with the Deviled Eggs which were done \"green eggs and ham style\", they were very delicious but a little difficult to eat due to the filling was a bit runny. Then we got the Cheddar Bacon Biscuits with apple butter. Nothing is better than a little cheese and bacon mixed in a biscuit. The apple butter was good, although it was a little more reminescent of apple jam than apple butter. Nonetheless it was still great paired with those biscuits. I got the Fork Tender Short Ribs and tender they were. I am not one to mix my food but the flavors from the meat with the mash and the veggies were just something I could not pass up in one bite.   For the drink I got the AZ Farmhand which had Hendricks Gin in it. It was like Tom Collins' country cousin. Very good, and I loved that it didn't lose the taste of gin with the bitters and Honey Lemonade mixed in it.   Overall, I cannot wait until we go back to Beckett's Table.",

    "text": "Ok, I'm starting a new category called Hipster Hype. That's when a restaurant throws in a communal table, brings back old school classics like deviled eggs as an appetizer, and/or covers bacon in chocolate on their dessert menu.   Beckett's Table does all three, so people are obviously going to lose their shit over it.   Let me break it down for you. Beckett's is fine. The meal will be pleasing, but it's overpriced for the execution:  The wait time for one drink will make it really hard to get a buzz on. If money is going to be spent on dinner, then that money wants to get drunk. Okay, not drunk, lightly buzzed ... still be able to drive. (Bad Teacher anyone? Cameron Diaz? Nope? Just me?)  The Osso Buco is an Osso-bummer. No marrow in the bone, just a hollowed out disappointment.   The Prime Flat Iron steak is served with literally 3 leaves from a brussels sprout and about just as many small potato halves. You really need to love meat to get this, because it's all you're getting. Also, don't expect it to be medium rare. Two people ordered it this way at my table and neither one got it medium rare.  That's about as A-Ok as you can get, right? Hipster Hype, you can't fool me with your charming farmhouse inspired interior.   Even my beloved Deviled Eggs were over-hyped. The only thing I felt was deserving of 5 stars was the service. The waiter was fantastic. Spot on.  You know, it may be complicated to give me a real life orgasm, but it ain't that hard to give me a food-gasm. Now that's just a fact.",

The service was great, and waiter did a great job, but it's all about the food.  We started with the bacon cheddar and grits and sausage,  The biscuits weren't even hot or fresh, they barely were warm.  The grits and sausage was pretty good.  Not sure worth the price, considering you barely get any sausage.  Our entree we ordered the Osso Bucco and short ribs.  Both entrees were OK, nothing to rave about.  One great thing about our dishes, they were presented well and looked very appetizing.  Overall we just weren't blown away about any of the dishes.  Lastly we ended the nice with dessert.  We shared the fig and pecan pie with ice cream.  My lady is a huge Pecan Pie fan, and she thought it was very average.  The big knock was the Pecan Pie wasn't hot or warm, it was room temperature.  The ice cream even had a weird taste.  Overall the dinner was experience was good, the service was good, great ambiance, and the restaurant had a good vibe, but the food was very average.  I was hoping to get Shepard's Pie, but it wasn't on the menu this time.  I was hoping for great biscuits, but they were a huge bust, considering they weren't even warm.  Maybe it was just a off night for them.",

The wine roasted pork Osso Bucco was succulent and tender as tender gets not to mention bursting with robust flavor. Hell, I woke up the next morning thinking about it! The same goes for the short ribs too...the wife's eyes were rolled back into her head during each bite....I may have even heard a moan or two! It was that good. Don't let any of the negative ninnies on here or Yelp fool you, Justin and his crew are crafting up some seriously good grub and be rest assured you will not be disappointed.

We breezed right in to our reservation with no problems and the waiters made us feel comfortable right away. I liked the feel of the place right away, too, with the high beamed ceilings, big open glass doors and cute, stylish touches scattered about.   The cocktail menu looked to die for but I was in a beer frame of mind so I went with their peach beer, which I loved, because it reminded me of Pyramid Apricot Ale, which is one of my East Bay faves. The others got some amazing looking concoctions, though, so if I ever get back here I'll be sure to get a cocktail. I was really impressed because one of my dining companions couldn't decide what beer she wanted so asked if they could serve her a flight, and they were happy to oblige (I'm not sure how she ended up getting charged for that, but the effort was still nice).   We got a bunch of appetizers to share. The mac and cheese is not as heavy and gooey as a lot of 'fancy' mac and cheeses that I've had, and I could not stop eating it. We also had some enchiladas with shrimp and sweet corn that was amazing. And of course, I couldn't resist the brussels sprouts - I can never resist brussels sprouts. I liked that they had shaved manchego on them but I have to say I've had better cooked and more flavorful brussels sprouts in my life. I think my least favorite app was the roasted veggie because it was a bit flavorless compared to everything else, and people didn't seem too enthused about the matzo ball soup either.   For my entree, I shared half of the salmon dish and half of the short rib with my neighbor. They've recently re-done the salmon dish, so it's different from the way it's described on the menu. The waiter had a really quiet voice so I had to have him repeat it to me a couple of times, but basically now they grill the salmon with salt and pepper and serve it with brussels petals and cornbread panzanella, cucmbers and some sort of yummy vinaigrette. I loved it! I love my salmon super rare so I wish they had asked me how I wanted it, but everyone else was perfectly fine with it. The short rib was very good as well - we replaced the mashed potatoes with more roasted veggies, but it also comes with string beans, one of my other favorite veggies.   The desserts were vast and impressive. Despite my loud, showy protests, I couldn't help digging my spoon into the gourmet s'mores dish, with its caramelized marshmallow and chocolate covered bacon, the creme brulee (standard but good), and my favorite, the sweet potato pie. My least favorite was the blueberry crumble, which surprised me because I was positive that it would be my favorite.   I'm no expert in Scottsdale culture, but I have a feeling that this little hotspot in a strip mall may be a major player in the local cuisine - its fresh, classic dishes and friendly service are definite crowd pleasers!",

What I can't understand about restaurants in Phoenix is that so many of them are super trendy inside and have some sort of a \"concept\" going on and are super expensive but THE FOOD ISN'T THAT GOOD. Isn't that sort of the point of a restaurant?   Well, Beckett's Table definitely represents this trend. Very nice rustic chic look inside. Friendly service. Food was ok... I liked the bread (that you have to ask for) and our dessert was excellent (coffee creme brulee). But my meal (sea bass I think) was a little too sweet and somehow bland at the same time (the best part of it was the shaved roots at the bottom). And my husband got the ribs, which were goodish. But neither was worth the around $20 price tag. I guess for me, the trendiness of a restaurant can't make up for mediocre food.",

As in, makes me lose my appetite. So, it's a huge compliment when I say, the smells coming out of the open kitchen are mouthwatering. When one of my dining companions received her short ribs, there were yet more mouthwatering aromas. WTH kind of alchemy is going on in that kitchen make this vegetarian salivate over dead animal?   No matter, fellow lovers of the plant plate, there's options for you here. For starters, you *must* order the Brussels sprouts (they do come with panchetta, but it can be left off). DIEvine. Seriously. As are the roasted root vegetables. I love when something simple is so delicious.  I normally never eat mac and cheese because it's so two-note (duh), but Beckett's Table makes it so that I finally *get* why people are all gaga over this stuff. It's very subtle, but those mustard seeds take the dish to a whole other level of delish bliss.   My entree, the oven roasted vegetable tower was probably the least exciting thing I ate last night night, but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated. I'm just not a fan of roasted peppers and onions which comprise about half of the stack. I'll leave this tiny meh at that, because the entire experience blows that away into the ether.   Next up, dessert. Although thoroughly stuffed at this point, I managed a bite of the sweet potato pie (incredible), the berry cobbler (delightfully tart, balanced with a sweet ice cream) and the piece de resistance, fig (yes, I said fig) and pecan pie.  I'd be remiss to not mention the cocktail list, which seemed quite creative. It was hard for me to choose, but I had the Az Farmhand, which has Hendricks gin, soda, ginger, lemonade and honey, many of my favorite cocktail ingredients. It did not disappoint. Fabulous selection of wines by the glass, too.  A thoroughly lovely experience from start to finish, Beckett's Table provides top notch food at affordable prices, with impeccable service in a rustic environment (you feel like you're in the hippest, coziest lodge).",

I'm sure that it didn't hurt that I had a little cutie with me as I had brought  one of my four kiddos, my 5 year old daughter, (I know I know, I'm a bit biased!) Service was painfully slow to start, but he also had been triple sat. Through the dinner  he was caught up, apologetic and attentive, and saved the experience, as service for me can break it no matter how good the food is. The table next to us added to a delightful experience with friendly conversation and both of us having the same taste in wine!   I loved that there were kids items available for her (grilled cheese, fries AND fruit with a cookie for her). Reading the menu and I zeroed in on the Short Ribs. They did not fail to impress and you nailed the red wine reduction! Rock shrimp enchiladas to start and they were equally as good. Had to try the cheddar bacon biscuits with apple butter and we both agreed they were delicious! Was tempted for the death by chocolate and wish I had gone for it as the March dessert: Brownie with ice cream and meringue was unimpressive missing decadence. The price point is very fair and reasonable.  As we were leaving the entire kitchen said good-bye and it was a great feeling knowing that when I said we'd be back, I meant it!   Great job Beckett's Table! You have captured my attention and I have already shared with many what great restaurant you are to visit!",

    "text": "It's been a few weeks since I ate at Beckett's, so those sharp details of the event have faded just a little from my mind's eye, but I just spent the last 10 minutes reliving my meal there and as it turns out, It was pretty great.  Apps. And I'm not talkin' the downloadable kind, although there are some appetizers here that just might be as addictive as Angry Birds. Beckett's made brussel sprouts sexy, which was the first brussel sprout magic trick I saw that night. The second was performed by our massive group; a disappearing act. I'm usually left to demolish what's left on plates but was actually kind of pouty when there were no sprouts left for me to kill. Get 'em. I was less impressed by the mac n' cheese but I'd still get it again. Roasted veggies were solid and little enchiladas were zingy.  I ordered the pork osso buco confit which I think I remember being outstanding. I ate it so fast it's probable that it was absolutely remarkable but I didn't take the time to savor it and its puffy little risotto bed. That's usually a sing that it was incredible.  And then dessert. Which one? All of them. A forkfull (and then some) of all of them. Yes to the creme brulee, yes to the cobbler, say wha? to the chocolate covered bacon s'mores (do it, if for no other reason than to tell your friends about it) and oh hexyes to the fig and pecan pie. I'm a die-hard pie guy and this stuff was sugary delight between two crusts served on a plate.  Food wise, these guys are pushing the five-star mark, so add in tremendous service and an atmosphere where you really do feel like friends coming to sit at your pal Beckett's table and you've got one of the Valley's best places to break bread with buds.",

Pork belly appetizer.... the best pork I've ever had (and I have indeed had the famed pork bun at Momafoku in New York).  This was the highlight of the meal... the shaped cut of the apples matched the shaped texture of the meat.  Likely the best $11 you will ever spend. 2.  I picked two sides instead of an entree:  mac and cheese (with pancetta) and chilled bean salad.  Both superb and actually, a great pairing. He had the pork hash (?)  Also fantastic.  3.  Dessert was the sweet potato pie with streussel.... but, for me, the star of that show was the homemade brown butter ice cream.  Chef Justin Beckett is doing great things, cooking with local food and has created an interesting environment.   Go go go.",

The macaroni and cheese was so, so. The pancetta was a great addition, but I like my macaroni and cheese, much more creamy and cheesey. Great ambience. I will definitely return again!!!!  I've retuned several times since my first post and it's become one of my favorite places to go. So fresh. Quality food, reasonable prices and decent service. Perfect!",

So we got there shortly before 5..... there were already people waiting for the doors to open...... We were promptly seated at 5:01, I kid, it was 5:00. OK but really to make a very long story short, I love this place. Service is beyond great..... bacon & cheddar biscuits w/apple butter are delish..... I ordered the petite chicken and it was perfectly moist on the inside crisp on the outside..... the kid had chicken strips & fries.....he loved his meal. The kids father had steamed halibut (special ordered bc he's ridiculous...... and on diet). I liked that they had a kids menu.... I liked that our waiter pointed out all of the pig statues to my kid, the pigs even have names. Good job! We will be back.",

    "text": "Met my family here for my son's 31st birthday.  The decor is simple but cozy, and it didn't hurt that we had a thunderstorm during dinner.  My son said he wants his house to look like the interior of the restaurant.  Our waiter was extrememely attentive, and even though our water glasses were teeny tiny, they were never empty.  The bussers were equally watchful and dishes were cleared promptly, glasses refilled, and appropriate silverware was always provided before the food.  Four of the party of six are present or former service industry folks, so we all really appreciated the service in this age of often feeling as if the waitstaff are doing you a favor waiting on you.  We started with the mac and cheese, fried deviled eggs, and roasted squash.  I am watching the middle age spread, so I only had one bite of the mac and cheese, but it was perection.  Excellent balance of cheeses (there are 4) and the thick cavatappi pasta was cooked just right.  Everyone else raved about the eggs and their dipping sauce, and the squash was finished off by my gluten free son.  Two folks had the osso buco, and literally scraped their plates clean - I'm guessing it was good?  One had the short ribs, and that disappeared quickly.  Two of us had the chicken, which was served with a bacon biscuit stuffing that was amazingly crispy and warm and soft all at the same time.  The cheeseburger was so big and filling my husband could not finish more than about 2/3 of it.  We all shared the s'mores plate, coconut cake, and some GF deserts we had brought for my son (which the server was nice enough to keep hidden and serve with a candle at the appropriate time)  The s'mores plate has squares of marshmallows that are perfectly roasted, small squares of graham crackers, an artistic swirl of creamy peanut butter (I'm assuming everything was house made) and, wait for it, chocolate covered bacon!  I am dieting and have a weigh in tomorrow, but I just did not care - I can't wait to tell my counselor I had chocolate covered bacon just to see her face!!!  Can't wait for an excuse to go back (it's a bit far from my house).  Oh, and it was ridiculously inexpensive!  $358 (not including tip) for six entrees, three appetizers, and three deserts, a bottle of wine (plus three glasses), 7 coctails and a cup of java!",

We started with the Grilled Cheese Appetizer, the grilled cheese was just a grilled cheese and the tomato soup was flavorless.  My husband ordered a burger the brioche bun was dry and the burger was okay. I ordered the short ribs and it was the best thing we ordered, but I could make it at home.

I love beets, yes a lot of people don't, but I have an obsession with them.  This place knows what they are doing.  They were perfect, unlike last weeks.  Delicious red and golden beets with a little goat cheese and pecans.  My entree was the salmon, also cooked to perfection, moist and tender.  And the piece de resistance was my dessert.  I was nice enough to share it with my husband.  The fig and pecan pie with a scoop of cream cheese lemon ice cream.  I am still thinking about it.  The crust of the pie was a piece of art.

I hardly ever write negative reviews because I am a very \"forgiving\" customer. However this was one of the worst experiences ever.  Let me start off by saying the atmosphere was very lively and upbeat which was great.  This was our first time going to this place so I didn't have any preconceived notions about it. This was not just a dinner but this was a celebration dinner for my husband. I made reservations for 19 almost a week before the date of the dinner. I was told that this wouldn't be a problem and to confirm my appt the day before. I actually spoke with about 3 different ppl during that week and everyone still said everything was fine.   When I got to the restaurant with my party we walked back to our table and it was 2 separate tables with our backs to the next table. If you have ever booked a dinner for family and friends, you would assume that you are all sitting together. Immediately I asked the waiter to see what can be done about this as I couldn't believe no one thought to tell me. The waiter said there was nothing he could do so of course I went straight to the manager. The arrogance and horrible attitude that I encountered was disgusting!!! I asked if they could please try and move tables around or accommodate us as this was a reservation that was held for almost a week. He didn't even try and said no there's nothing he can do. I asked him why I wasn't told this and he said \"we do not have to disclose that.\" I literally couldn't believe that we were bringing them that much business and they treated me like I was walking in off the streets.   I had to walk away from him as I could feel my blood pressure rising. A family friend went up to him and kept trying to get this worked out and needless to say he wouldn't even apologize. He then stated that he would give us champagne and desserts on the house. He never once came over to the table to apologize or even check on us. They kept saying there was no way to move the tables yet we thought of a TON of ways to get all of us together.   The dirty looks and rolling of the eyes by the manager and certain staff members was unacceptable to me. The sad thing is that the food was pretty good but because of the horrible service that we received, I would never step foot in this place. Others in the large party said the same thing as they couldn't believe the horrible treatment we received.   I have been to many restaurants around the world and I know what good food and service feels like. This was below average by far. If you are wanting to plan a large party or dinner with this place-RUN! It was a nightmare...",

    "text": "this place gets a LOT of hype and, unfortunately, doesn't live up to it.   i went for my birthday which was also the start of spring restaurant week. understandably, they were busy. my husband and i arrived early for our reservation, checked in and took a seat at the bar. i ordered a specialty cocktail which was supposed to contain muddled mint and a sugared rim. it arrived with no suragered rim and whole mint leaves. fine. it was still good.  dinner time came and with it being restaurant week, we looked over the menu. had i ordered off the resturant week menu instead of the regular menu, i would have paid more for the three items than had i just ordered straight off the menu. bad form!   so my mother and i both ordered the red pepper cannelloni. my huband ordered the green chili pork (?) off the restaurant week menu and my brother got the barbeque pork. my brother was the only one who liked his food. the green chili was runny/oily and lacked good flavor.  the canneloni had ZERO flavor. amazingly bland vegetables inside an amazingly bland red pepper with an amazingly bland sauce on the side. no good. the server (who was very nice but very rushed and difficult to find) immediately offered to get us something else whcih we appreciated. i got the chopped salad which was fine. nothing special. my mom got the chicken and dumplings - again, lacking any significant flavor. the manager came over, apologized for the cannelloni dishes and said they've been experienceing problems and very mixed reviews on vegetable dishes since they opened. i suggest getting to work on something good containing vgetables. this is NOT going to cut it.  dessert was also ho-hum. the pecan/fig pie had a great filling but a rock solid crust . my husband said the bacon s'mores were too much work - messy and not very good.   overall i'm totally shocked at the good reviews this place continues to receive. i just wasn't at all impressed.",

    "text": "I was surprised that it was hard to get a mid-evening reservation here a few days out, given how long the restaurant has been open.  So my expectations were high going in for my 5pm reservation.  The service was absolutely outstanding -- from the host stand, to the server, to the busboy (who didn't really appear to be busboy, but more of a manager).  The server, Drew, was very knowledgeable about the food and wine, and seems to really enjoy his job.  I appreciate that.  For the most part, the food was pretty fantastic. We started off with the brussel sprouts and chicken meatballs.  The brussel sprouts (with pancetta) were delicious; while the meatballs were good, not great, but definitely good.  I ordered the short rib for my entree, which literally was like butter on my fork.  When they say \"no fork needed\" they mean it!  It was so tender and delish!  I also tasted the pork chop special, which was also very good!  I ordered the toasted coconut cake for dessert and while its presentation was fantastic, the cake itself was just okay.  It was a litte on the dry side.  Overall, I had a great experience and will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Went tonight to try Beckett's for Father's Day, having heard great things.  The place was packed when we arrived and smelled like the BBQ ribs that were on special.  Great modern open concept, including a community table and an open kitchen.  Our server, Cort, was informative and answered our questions about some of the menu items and we watched what others ordered as the dishes came out of the kitchen.  We ordered the roast beets and salmon rilletes as appetizers and the beets were good but the salmon rillettes were great, the preserved lemon adding a sharp citrus flavor.  The short rib entree was delicious and fell apart on the fork but the flavor of the Pork Osso Bucco Confit was unbelievably good.  We tried the coffee creme brulee and the fig Pecan Pie and the pie definitely won out.  The citrus ice cream they get from Crave was the perfect addition to counter the sweetness of the pie.  can't wait to come back and try some of the other dishes we saw, including the steamed mussels.",

Dinner started with the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup appetizer - really great. My boyfriend ordered the Short Rib and I went with the Roasted Chicken. There was a lot of chicken and it got a bit overwhelming. However, the stuffing was so good. I would have rather had the Short Rib! It was amazing. We ended with Chocolate covered Bacon S'mores and they made me speechless. My new sweet addiction for sure. We experienced such great service. This is a new favorite spot.",

    "text": "Let me start my review with a confession. The only thing that I could possibly dislike about Beckett's Table is that it's not in Denver.   Loves: - The comfy, cozy layout, nice big open kitchen where you can watch all the action, and the rustic yet sophisticated table setting with copper napkin rings, short and stocky water glasses, and vases with a simple wild flower.  - Everything on the menu. It was very difficult to choose from all the comforting stick-to-your ribs goodies like country pate, beef bourguignon, short ribs, matzo ball soup, chicken and dumplings......wow. - Five stars for the appetizers. Roasted veggies were spot-on delicious, the new spin on mac and cheese was refreshing to see, and loved how the rock shrimp enchiladas were served in a tiny cast iron skillet. - If you remember anything I say, save room for dessert! I sampled a bite of everything, and my faves were the mini s'mores with chocolate covered bacon, the pear/blueberry cobbler served in a little pot, and creme brulee. - Again with the bathrooms, Arizona. I dug the sliding doors, and the glass bricks which almost made you feel like you could look into the neighboring restroom. Is that weird? - Order an adult bev, my friends. Your mouth will thank you. - Even though we had a very large party, the waitstaff handled us with ease and I don't remember a mishap  Then why not five stars, LL Cool L, you say? It was almost, almost a five. Nearly everything was spot on except that I fumbled on ordering my main, the daily salmon special. It was definitely outshined by the atmosphere, drinks, apps, other people's dishes, and dessert.  Note: We were lucky enough to snag rock star parking, but just be aware that it's a strip mall setting so you may have to hunt for a spot. Weird, right?",

I was not a fan of the beef bourguignon shepherd's pie or the white bass. Still, it's a really comfy place, kind of rustic and cabin-like and they have great servers.

The front desk staff amazing and the owner is always warm and sweet.  Staff worked together well (my water glass was NEVER empty) even though there is a bottle at the table they always make sure your glass is full.  Our server was a little quiet and reserved I couldn't figure it out it was a roller coaster, once you think \"he's a little too curt\" then he will be friendly and attentive, then we hit another low.  Specialty cocktails are very good. Cheese and bacon biscuits with apple butter (I mean how could you go wrong?) they were good with pieces of real bacon but they would have been delicious if they were warm or hot in anyway.  Grits with shrimp and sausage was good.  Crow's Dairy feta was ok as well not great I did like the roasted fennel. Brussels sprouts (my favorite vegetable) I didn't care for theirs tough and lacking of flavor.  Grilled cheese with pancetta delicious it reminded me of one I had on the street in Florence.  Plenty of cheese including the bread it was a bit salty but understandable considering what it is. Finally deviled eggs of the day, second favorite after the grilled cheese. Presentation 5 stars and so cute it was a shame to eat but I got over it quickly Decor is warm, chic and inviting.",

Also many items have dairy so if you have a dairy this place is not for you. What we did order was ok, nothing outstanding. The salmon was very fishy, the hamburger had a bad taste as there is Pork in it. They were very nice but I would not return until the chef realizes not every enjoys pork or bacon.",

The staff was very accommodating to the constant change in number of people attending, but luckily on a Sunday evening, it was not packed. Had a nice seating outside, communal table style.  Various appetizers, and tried the grits with sausage and brussel sprouts. Very tasty. I ordered the pork osso buco confit with the waiter and coworker's recommendation. It being served with the spaetzle was a huge plus, which was pretty good. The pork was very tender and fell off the bone. We also indulged in local AZ wine as on Sundays, bottles are half off!  My favorite part was the cheddar bacon biscuits we ordered with the apple butter. Biscuits were very flaky and delicious!  For dessert I went with the chocolate covered bacon and s'mores, a deconstructed version. I don't like marshmallows, but these were homemade and tasted super different than Kraft, in a good way! Whipped peanut butter and graham crackers were excellent as well. I tasted my coworker's peach cobbler, and that was even yummier!   Great ambience, superb service, and delicious food! Excellent start to welcome us to Phoenix!",

Conceptualized as an honest kitchen built on the idea of family and friends, its 2010 opening seemingly far longer than just a little over six years ago, Beckett's table was formed as the result of two couples with a passion for food, beverage and the city they inhabit, most of the ingredients brought in from no more than thirty miles away while Northern Arizona's growing number of Wineries become more and more prevalent on a sizeable drink list.  All blonde wood and bricks with a open kitchen in the rear, a style familiar to many modern-American kitchens, it was moments prior to a nine o'clock reservation that the party checked in with a doorside hostess, a quick path past several well-dressed  locals seating three at a square table with a good view of the pass, Chef Justin and his team working diligently with more attention to detail that rumors have suggested, a nightly special of skewered Pig Trotters unfortunately just sold-out, though the menu still presented plenty of choices.  Dining with one wide awake youngster and his mother, a bargain glass of Sparkling Wine starting the night's celebration, it from a friendly middle-aged woman that a basket of warm Bread was delivered, the cheesy Onion Rolls quite nice while dark Rye Rolls were event better, particularly as a means for sopping the leftover Sauce from a bowl of creamy Grits, grilled Sausage and light notes of Mustard.  Unable to ignore one of several self-designated signatures amongst the starters, \"Beckett's Original Grilled Cheese\" served crunchy with a smooth center alongside piquant Tomato Soup made for dipping, entrees arrived shortly thereafter with \"Beckett's Table Signature Fork Tender Short Ribs\" and a sizable hunk of confit Pork Osso Bucco, the competition for which was richer essentially a toss-up, though tilted in favor of the Beef as the buttery Potato puree seemed more decadent than the springy Garlic and Black Pepper Egg Noodles.   More than a little surprised by a generously portioned Cheeseburger and French Fries from the Kid's menu, a decision to double down on Bacon Cheddar Biscuits and oven-roasted Stuffing made from  day-olds proving well worth it as each set a high-standard for American Holiday staples, dessert saw deconstructed Peanut Butter, Bacon S'mores that would have benefitted from housemade Graham Crackers presented next to nothing short of a brilliant idea, the \"Award Winning\" Pecan Pie with a Fig Jam base made all the more enchanting be a lightly charred  Crust and a tangy ball of Ice Cream.",

The Mac and cheese was dry, the Brussels sprouts were hard, and the stuffing under the petite skillet chicken tasted just awful.

But it was still over 100 degrees outside and more than a third of the tables were reserved without people sitting inside for the whole time we had our meal outside. We agreed, so its not their fault to seat us outside. But is a raging fire really necessary outside in September? We moved three tables down and still felt the heat waves...ugggh. Mac and cheese is ok, but a watermelon salad that is about $15 should come with more than an eighth of the plate. Watermelon is not that expensive, right? Also, I don't remember reading that there were frozen green bell peppers on top with the feta, and it was really odd. I guess the bright side is that I didn't have to suffer through a large salad!!",

It  lacked flavor. The scallops were cooked perfectly but the accompanying chorizo was a little spicy for my son. The shrimp and grits were really good though my other son found the grits too creamy.

I have absolutely no complaints about the wait as it was a busy week for them, and sitting enjoying the champagne and relaxing was a great start to a enjoyable evening.

Beckett's Table is located in the heart of what I call a food mecca!  Next to Crudo's, the Market by Jennifer's and The Vig.  Anyways, I came here for a quick dinner bite with some friends.  My partner and I decided to share since we weren't that hungry.  We went for the House Made Ricotta Berry Salad and the Tuscan Shrimp.  Needless to say, the salad was well plated and an artwork to look at.  Eat with your eyes first they say and indeed we did.  The salad was plated more like a charcuterie board with a sweet strawberry puree dotted on the side; we mixed it with the arugula and spiced pistachios and soft semi-goowy ricotta cheese.  Overall, a good start to wet the palate for things to come!  Our entree came as a soup; shrimp, sausage, roasted tomatoes and beans and atop with a parmesan crustini.  I thought this dish was good, but it was nothing too exciting.  I thought it needed some heat and some extra crunch.  I appreciated the beans, but later thought I need some more texture.    In the end, Beckett's Table is still a place that deserves my love.  I love the rustic American feel and open kitchen.  The place is warm and welcoming. Service seems knowledgeable and definitely on top of things -- I drink a lot of water and not once was my water glass empty! - Enjoy!",

Our waitress was nice, but she acted like she was new and missed a lot of things. She was apologetic at the end of the meal, but didn't offer a discount or free desert or any kind of explaination.

Beckett's has very cool drinks and wines. I started with a house Pinot Noir and my boyfriend a simple IPA. Our friends ordered some of the various mixed drinks and I sampled a few; strong! Since I'm not much of a mixed drink girl, I'm happy with my Pinot and the wine selection here is awesome! We moved on to our table and ordered a few apps. We had the Mac cheese with pancetta: a melt in your mouth delight! We had the deep fried deviled eggs: different and I'm a fan! The biscuits and apple butter: if your gonna splurge, these biscuits are to die for! The grilled cheese with the small bowl of tomato soup for dipping: I thot the bread was too thick, but everyone else loved them. For dinner, the fork tender short ribs are huge and so, so tender. They are presented atop a mashed potato, baby brussel sprouts and carrots. I've had the Osso Bucco before and both of these meat dishes are a total treat. My friend who was visiting from Hawaii, had sangria and the butter salad. I tested it and it was light and very good. The sangria was also great, light and refreshing! To finish our meal, my boyfriend and I had the Coconut Cake. Yum. Decadence in one bite kind of yum. It is a moist cake with coconut sided with coconut pudding and dark chocolate swirled around. Need I say more? Our friends had the Smores: smores with peanut butter and chocolate dipped bacon. I think its a bit weird and not a fan, but they loved it. It's nice to \"Come Together\" as the pins say on the tables, and have a neuvo American food place be trendy with comfort food classics.",

My husband once got a special Cassoulet and had to send it back because it was all white beans and very little pork. Even the waitress agreed.  We went with a large group and were over charged for a bottle of wine we did not drink so we had to ask for them to take that off. That same night I got home and realized I had also been overcharged for a drink at the bar (it was still Happy Hour...or Social Hour...or whatever they call it).   Speaking of the Social Hour, it is really annoying that it is only at certain areas of the restaurant. We got there once during the Social Hour and ordered drinks at our table. We were then told Social Hour only applies if you order drinks at the bar or are sitting at a special table. This just seems silly to me. Everyone else is also right that the host guy is not friendly AT ALL. We have had friendly waitstaff pretty consistently though.

My favorite is the pork osso buco. I am not a fan of pork or really any meat on the bone, but this dish is AMAZING. Ever since I discovered it I haven't been able to order anything else because I love it so much. Between my husband and I, we've had the short ribs, cast iron chicken, chicken and dumplings and pork chop. Our favorites are the pork osso buco and the cast iron chicken, but we haven't had a bad dish yet.  The atmosphere is very low key classy. Its the kind of place where you can dress up or be casual and not feel out of place. It's fancy food, but it fills you up and when you get the dish you actually know how to eat it. For the quality of the food, it is actually a really decent price too. The service is always great as well.  Like I said this is our favorite restaurant, so much so that this is where we went the night that we got engaged. We didn't want to make a big deal about it, but the waiter made everything feel special and intimate, without making a spectacle out of it. I wish I would remember his name but was obviously distracted. Now it is our special restaurant that we go to for all of our special occasions. Its relaxing, intimate, cozy and a little fancy all at this same time.",

This place has everything that it should:  1.) Fantastic ever changing dishes made with fresh ingredients which are more often than not local to Arizona (supporting our local farmers here is very important)  2.) The culinary menu is varied enough that seems to have food for the healthy, the carnivore, the vegetarian, the light or heavy eater. they also have one of the best kid's menus I have ever seen  3.) Their cocktail list seems to have a bit of a theme but varied enough that anyone who enjoys their libations can find something they'll like  4.) The wine list is awesome... they again support local vineyards here in Arizona and have a special HH dedicated to promoting them. as for the other varietals, they are varied from new world to old, from the common to the exotic and of course they make sure that there is a price range that anyone can afford  5.) An ambiance that makes you feel like your family member or close friend is right over that expo kitchen counter cooking just for you. The seating is openly arranged in a way that it is cozy but spacious as well. The use of wood almost everywhere can only be pulled off by certain types of places and this is one of them. Kudos to the designer  6.) Last but not least, the people that work here seem to be just the types of people I would hire myself. Knowledgeable, sincere, gracious, and hard working, the majority of this staff knows that they are not novices (reason I say most is because there is one server that is \"full of himself\" and it shows).  All in all, this is one of my favorite gems in the Greater Phoenix Area here in the beautiful state of Arizona. We are proving to the rest of the country bit by bit that Arizona is where it's at.. food, people, scenery, activities, etc. I love being an Arizonan!!",

Smooth process and would recommend making a reservation just to be sure.   I had the osso buco with spinach spaetzle and the Mr. had the short ribs. Apparently the short ribs are cooked for 12 hours. Great googly moogly... That's a long time!! Knives are completely unnecessary afore both dishes as the meats just falls off the bone. Extra super tasty... And crap!!! I just realized I left my leftovers in the hotel room. Dangit! I was looking forward to a second go around.   Pumpkin porter was tasty. Tastes just like fall to me. Spicy and full flavored. Stella on draught was as expected and refreshing.   Dessert. Let me tell you about the dessert. Get it. Do whatever you have to do to save room for dessert. Holy farking ships... It was the best. The mister had the chocolate covered bacon smores. I had the toasted coconut cake. Perfect in every way!   Service was amazing. Drinks overfloweth and we were never needing to flag anyone down. Pamela gave great recommendations and was adequately attentive. I wouldn't have had it any other way!   For sure we'd eat here again when in town.",

    "text": "I came here the other week while on a business trip to Phoenix. A coworker of mine recommended it and it did not disappoint!   Our table of 4 started with a few appetizers.  We had:  - organic brussels sprouts, lemon vinaigrette, pancetta  - beckett's original grilled cheese, pancetta (aka bacon), four cheeses, roasted red pepper tomato soup - chicken meatballs & smoky tomato sauce, roasted onions, eggplant & peppers, bread crumbs  I did not try the grilled cheese (though I did try the roasted red pepper soup/dip, yumm!), but the brussel sprouts (minus pancetta, I don't eat pork) and the chicken meatballs were delicious!  For the main course, my table of 3 big guys + me was heavy on the pork. All 3 of them ordered a different pork dish (they have a lot of pork on the menu!) and I went with the beef braised short ribs. I was going to be good and get fish, but when the waiter described the short ribs I couldn't resist. They were so flavorful and so tender that I've dreamed about that dish since! Dish descriptions:  - fire roasted green chile pork stew, corn bread, cotija cheese - pork osso buco confit grilled apple spaetzle, pepper reduction - roasted & grilled pork chop*, griddled grit cake, braised greens - fork tender short ribs, mashed potatoes, roasted root veggies, red wine reduction  I did not try any of the pork dishes, but reviews from my coworkers were off the charts. I would order the short ribs again in a heart beat.  The service was also exceptional. One of the most enjoyable meals I've had in Phoenix, I'd highly recommend checking out Beckett's Table!",

    "text": "Finally I got to try this place! I really wanted to sit outside next to the fireplace, but it was raining (so I let it slide..this time). One of the main things I was really excited about was trying the chocolate covered bacon, our server (I wish I remembered his name) gave me a sample since I was talking about it so much and it was so good!  I have to say, our server was awesome and I give him props for dealing with 3 obnoxious girls.   We ordered the chicken meatballs, definitely good but I would rather try something else next time.  My friend ordered the mussels, they were yummy! I definitely recommend that if you are in the mood for seafood :) (Even though it won't be the best of the best :P). My other friend convinced me to split with her ( I wish I didn't, I was still so hungry), anywhoooo...we ended up splitting the short ribs and sweet jesus it was amazing! Oh and the mashed potatoes were so addictive to where I ordered an extra side of  it.. *fatty*.   Lastly for dessert, we ordered the pumpkin spice creme brulee... and WOW, I am going to be coming back here JUST for that, it was one of the best desserts my mouth has ever encountered.  All in all, great experience and great service! *my drinks were never empty; in general, we never had to wait.   I will definitely be back here again for not only the food but  definitely before the pumpkin spice creme brulee goes byebyeeee.   P.S. I will be posting pictures up soon :o",

    "text": "Too much \"Foo Foo\" and not enough substance. Deep fried hard boiled eggs, sausage cooked in grits or brussel sprouts are not my idea of appetizers that you would enjoy with a glass or two of wine. The meat main courses were okay but the side dishes like the spinach spaetzle was bland with no flavor. My wife had the Ahi Tuna and wouldn't eat it because it tasted like it was spoiled. It may have been the spices or sauces and she normally loves Ahi, but not this night.   The guy at the front door needs to get a job in the back kitchen where he doesn't  have to deal with people but once you get past him the rest of the staff were absolutely wonderful and did great job.   None of the four of us will go back because the menu was just too \"over the top\" but it obviously appeals to a lot of others because the place was packed. I am not saying that you shouldn't try Beckett's but make sure you read their menu on line first because it may just be too \"Foo Foo\" for your taste!",

Parking on a busy Friday night required a bit of patience but was not a hassle. Service was prompt and polite. Post- meal hovering resulted in one less star. No coffee was offered, and multiple waitstaff glances at our foodless table left me feeling more rushed than relaxed. The menu was amazing! Darn near every wine they have is offered by the glass. What a plus for we winos. We chose and shared Mac n cheese, grits and sausage, and Caprese salad to start. The Mac portion was dinner sized, the others were appetizer appropriate and sooo tasty. I chose roast chicken for dinner. Fall off the bone tender, vegetable- infused flavor satisfied to the max. The frozen caramel parfait topped off the evening with a perfectly sized bit of sweetness. Satisfied not stuffed. Thanks BT!",

All the little touches are definitely noticed.  The only criticism I have is that I really did not care for the lemonade. It is sweetened with honey and at least the drinks we had were WAY heavy on the honey, it was more like honeyade.  The mac and cheese with pancetta is a MUST. Pancetta is NOT bacon, it's much better! In fact quite a few dishes use the pancetta, for which I am grateful. Looking forward to a return visit!",

    "text": "Wednesday, October 27, 2010. Opening Night.  As we walked in we were greeted by Michelle Beckett (owner/partner) and she had even recognized me from my comment on their facebook page. This meant a lot because it shows that they are taking time and investing in the utilization of social networking. They want to know their customers and build the relationships to become that \"neighborhood hangout,\" or a True Third Place.   The decor of the building is absolutely perfect. The dark wood, exposed trusses, brick wall, open kitchen are all inviting and comforting. They did a good job of expressing their business concept in their design; they aren't trying to be pretentious or snooty. They are down to earth and simple with the decor and aesthetics which leads them into being a comfortable neighborhood hangout. I was impressed with the wait staff. They were knowledgeable and had tried everything on the menu. This allowed them to give recommendations and answer questions. Likewise, they weren't your typical high school or college servers. They were seasoned wait staff, and it was apparent. My only comment on the service would be that the timing was a little bit off from ordering 1st course, 2nd course, and the time for our after dinner cocktails. However, these are minimal kinks I would expect on night one, so I see it as a nonissue.   Now for the food. The four of us decided to share the Beckett's Original Grilled Cheese ($9). This grilled cheese had four cheeses and pancetta. It was delicious, and the roasted red pepper soup to accompany was great. This plays a lot into Beckett's concept. It's not food that you can't make at home, he's just going to do it a little better, and for a fare price.  We ordered a bottle of Page Springs Grenache ($41). It was very nice to see a handful of local wines on the list, this is something that I think all local restaurants should strive to do. It was nice to see chef Justin Beckett be able to escape the kitchen and make rounds in the dining room to greet his guests and thank them for coming, etc.  For our main courses we had the Wood Fired Mussels ($18), Fork Tender Short Ribs ($19), Local Pork Osso Buco Confit, and Chicken n Dumplings ($16). The mussels were great. It seems a lot of restaurants are serving mussels in a white wine broth these days (Beckett's Table, Iruna, Liberty Market, etc.). Each of them does it a little bit different, and Beckett's take on this dish is using a fennel broth. Normally I am not a fan of fennel, but it was mild enough, and with the other spices it was a good combination. My only concern (not even a complaint) was the portion of the dish. I had 32 mussels in my bowl. I spoke with Justin after we ate and he mentioned that that was not the correct amount.  However, we discussed portioning and he is definitely being generous with the amount of mussels in this dish. I'd say it's a great deal! The short ribs were cooked to perfection, and lived up to the name \"fork tender.\" They were seasoned well with a nice bite of cracked black pepper. A very generous portion as well. The pork osso buco was delicious. It was tender and flavorful. Its side of butternut squash spaetzle was a nice touch. My little brother ordered the chicken n dumplings. These were delicious, and Beckett's take on this nostalgic dish includes saffron in the cream sauce. It created a very smooth flavor that definitely set it apart from all other chicken n dumplings (except our family recipe, of course).   We thought about dessert... and well... we had to. Chocolate dipped bacon s'mores. Wow. Another great taste combination, taking the smokey, salty flavor of the bacon and dipping it in the sweet chocolate was great. Their marshmallows are house-made, which is just a nice touch. It did come with a dollop of peanut butter whipped cream that complimented the dish.   Likewise, we ordered after dinner cocktails. I ordered the Legend City Cocktail. The name is something that will be nostalgic for those that have grown up in the Valley. This drink I feel was a great twist on a classic Old Fashioned. It was Woodford bourbon, Ricard, bitters and a splash of lemonade: served straight up. I thought it was delicious, but I have began to acquire a bias for classic bourbon cocktails. My mom ordered Miss Katie's Pimms Cup. This drink is named after one of the owning partners Katie Stephens, who also came around to our table and introduced herself and chatted with us for a few minutes. My dad, growing up on a farm appreciated and ordered the AZ Farmhand. It contains Hendricks Gin, ginger, lemonade, honey syrup and a splash of soda. Very refreshing drink as well.  I will be back Beckett and his staff have done a GREAT job opening this new neighborhood hangout.",

    "text": "It's a brilliant concept, really, non-threatening food (brussels sprouts are probably the scariest thing on the menu) given an interesting tweak here and there to make it worthy of a night out. And judging from the crowd that showed up on a rainy Sunday evening, it's working. The diners were a mixed bunch: lots of families with their kids, lots of singles at the community table.        Chef Justin Beckett, formerly of Canal, his wife and some friends took over the space previously occupied by That's Italiano, a restaurant that deserved to close. They did a lovely renovation, with exposed wood beams, an open kitchen, lots of windows, and the above mentioned community table, made from a fallen black walnut tree. To put you in a good mood there's a number of specialty cocktails, a nice wine list, and 4 draught beers, plus others by the bottle. Our server, Allison, was delightful - very funny, but also very professional.        The menu isn't large, but it was hard to make a selection since everything sounds good. An interesting appetizer entry is Beckett's Original Grilled Cheese served with  roasted red pepper tomato soup ($9). Creamy Grits & Spicy Andouille Sausage ($8) was tempting. Ken opted to get two appetizers for his meal, the Chef's Country Pate ($8) and those scary Roasted Brussels Sprouts with pancetta, shaved manchego cheese and lemon thyme vinaigrette ($6). I thought it strange that this was considered an appetizer. For me, the Crisp Butter Lettuce Salad, green grapes, toasted pecans, candied lemon vinaigrette ($6) and a side of Mac and Cheese ($5, as are all the side dishes including the bacon cheddar biscuits which we ordered while trying to decide on the rest of our meal). Our friend Sena decided, after much pondering, on the pork osso bucco ($17). And Leon ordered his usual hamburger - in this case the \"B\"  Burger with Buttered Brioche, Boursin, Bib lettuce, Beefsteak tomato ($13).       So how was it? The biscuits, which arrived first were a good omen. They were more scone-like than biscuity, but they were delicious, especially with the accompanying apple honey butter. Ken enjoyed his pate, which came with lots of things to eat with it, including peanut brittle. Sena's osso bucco was delicious, tender and rich. The only problem was that the carrots served in the roasted vegetable medley were terribly undercooked. The same was True, to a lesser extent, of the brussels sprouts plus they were pretty much tasteless. The vinaigrette on my salad was outstanding, but the grapes and pecans were in short supply. Leon said his burger was just okay, but he seems to feel that way about most of the burgers he orders. One day we'll find him one that will knock his socks off! If anybody has any suggestions, please let me know.       The entrees didn't live up to the biscuits, but I had high hopes for dessert ($5 each). There's a strange one - Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'Mores with caramel, housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter, and graham crackers. But I had to go with the Fig & Pecan Pie which came with cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream. This was delectable, rich but not too sweet. I usually don't like cream cheese ice cream, but this was a perfect match for the pie and the citrus zest just sung out. Loved it. Ken grumbled a little about the poor selection of tea, and the fact that there was no espresso.       All things considered, despite the negatives, I'd go back. I have the feeling that things will get better and better.   Beckett's Table 3717 E.

    "text": "I am very excited about the addition of this new restaurant in \" my hood\"-lower Arcadia. I am such a lazy person when it comes to traveling far for a good meal so when I heard about Beckett's Table I was anxious to give it a try. No disappointment here! The place is heaven. Lovely warm atmosphere-urban without the pretense. The service casual but efficient. And the food....the perfect combination of comfort and elegance. We had the outrageous biscuits to start with our lovely cocktails, the lobster enchiladas-(delicious taste but I missed the lobster..) and the perfectly prepared salmon. Too  full to try the pecan pie-had the creme brulee-which was creamy goodness but would have liked an accompanying fruit or something with it. The menu had so many things I wanted to try-I will be back again and again. Prices are reasonable-2 drinks, biscuits, one appetizer,one entree, 2 desserts all for less than 70.00.",

I finally decided to get the short ribs, and switched out my side for brussel sprouts.  (which I was grateful that they did).  All in all, the food is decent, the space is great, and has an urban feel (other than the TV, and the outdoor seating next to the parked cars).  The service was extremely friendly, but unpolished.  It's always best when service goes unnoticed.  Not sure I'll be back due to the limited menu.",

    "text": "The rib-sticking southern style menu makes one worry they'll need a quadruple bypass by the end of their meal -- or at least a cardiologist standing nearby. The food is surprisingly light, non-greasy and lightly salted, so put away the defibrillator and order a hefty side of Mac & Cheese with Crispy Pancetta or Apple & Red Onion Spaetzle to go with your Chicken & Dumplings, Short Ribs or Green Chile Pork Stew. My favorite menu item the Fig & Pecan pie with cream cheese ice cream. So good I returned the next night for more. Chef Justin Beckett not only wows customers with his healthy home-style cooking, but also with his outgoing personality, regularly visiting customers table side and explaining how he prepares things like the tuille \"sand\" that accompanies his colorful, yet simple beet salad. Definitely save room for desert, or be ready to return the next evening to finish what you started. This restaurant is on my hit list now for every visit to the Phoenix area.",

I love the surprise of looking on the specials board to see what Chef and Company has created.  The staff are very attentive and know the menu items in and out.  I love the deviled eggs - they are always fresh and hot.  I do not believe that they are microwaved as another reviewer has indicated.  My opinion is the food is fresh, hot, and plated appropriately for the type of cuisine it is.  Beckett's has been reviewed by others appropriately in my opinion, save for the recent 2 star review. It's a great place to take a date, eat with family and/or friends, or dine alone at the bar with the friendly bar staff.  Beckett's is the best!!",

Lots of space between tables. Love the simplicity of the tables. White cloth, simple glasses, little vase with a fresh, simple flower.  Decor was simplistic. Earthy, environmentally friendly looking and a bit retro in some respects.   The waiter was professional and friendly. He was happy to give suggestions.  The help was amazing. Always refilling our water glasses even though we had a bottle of water on the table. We never filled our glasses ourselves. The staff stayed on top of everything.   Wedge salad was pretty good with the Green Goddess dressing. I'm not sure what the bitterness was from though.  Grilled cheese appetizer was delicious.  I ordered the mahi special.  I'm not sure why the shrimp in it tasted like it was previously frozen. My dish was nothing special but the ambience and service made up for it.  I would go back to see what else I could try.  I'd be up for another adventure.",

    "text": "Thrice I have visited Beckett's Table, and thrice I have enjoyed it. The vibe is cool, modern, and mellow. The first time around, we went with a large group of friends. We got the grilled cheese appetizer to start, and then I ordered the chicken and dumplings. The appetizer was rich and delicious and I have ordered it every visit since. The chicken and dumplings, however, were underwhelming, which is probably why I had forgotten about them when I went the second time and ordered them again. The chicken and dumplings is the sole reason Beckett's doesn't get a five stars from me. I mean, if the meal wasn't good the first time, and then a year later they haven't improved it or removed it from the menu, then that's your bad, Beckett's Table. Even the waiter tonight admitted to it being bland (although he said it in a much kinder way). Tonight, however, I remembered to stray from the plain, boring meal that had plagued me the two previous times, and ordered the short ribs instead. Good golly, what a difference that little meal made! It was absolutely delicious and could easily be pulled apart by my fork alone. The short ribs melted in my mouth along with the creamy mashed potatoes. Seriously good. The service tonight was also right on par. Our table of six never ran low on drinks, and our server was quite patient with all of the questions we had regarding the menu and specials. My mother-in-law enjoyed the experience tonight so much, that she asked to speak directly with the manager to tell her how wonderful the service and food was. Beckett's Table, you're lucky I waited so long to write this review - It wouldn't have been as glowing last time. But you have earned yourself a solid 4, maybe even 4.5, stars from this girl.",

Becketts Table has struck just the right chord and each time we've been there we left happy happy happy.  A  lot of their dishes are prepared with bacon and other delectable but not so healthy ingredients, and eating health consciously in a restaurant can often be a drag leaving one wanting. Not this last visit. The sea bass was prepared beautifully and was perfectly satisfying. I did take a bite of the biscuits and they were heavenly. But a bite was all I needed. Especially since I ordered a side of spinach spaetzle, which is the best way yet to eat your veggies. The only problem we encountered was parking. A little guidance would have been helpful as we drove up to a very small and very full lot. In a sheer stroke of luck, someone was leaving as we arrived and we got the one open spot. Pity the party that arrived just after us.",

We may not have gone here on our own because the location is pretty out of our way, but I am glad we did. Our server, Brandon, was awesome! He was knowledgeable and helpful, and he made our visit extra enjoyable. My hubby and I showed up on time while the rest of our party was running late. Rather than punish us for being there on time, the hostesses sat us immediately. We ordered our drinks and the grilled cheese and tomato soup appetizers. What a great idea! I thought it might be a bit strange for an appetizer, but it was the perfect amount of food to tide us over until our party arrived. We dipped the sandwich into the creamy, spicy soup.  YUMMY! After our party arrived, they ordered appetizers. I did not try the roasted feta appetizer, but it looked delish and my friends really enjoyed it. My main course was as good as the appetizer. I had the flank steak. Usually a flank steak is not the best cut of meat, but this steak was excellent!! Thickly cut and tender; this steak was perfectly prepared. We will definitely return to this place, and we will request to sit in Brandon's section.",

    "text": "It was my friends birthday. We have heard about Beckett's table and we were excited to go. There are so many great restaurants in Phoenix, we heard this was good.  They have a limited specific menu. That is fine by us. But what is unacceptable is to be out of one item on this limited menu. We ordered it and were told they were out. When the manager approached we let her know we were disappointed and all we received was an invitation to next time preorder the item when we make our next reservation. There will not be another reservation from us or those we take to dinner. AGAIN there are too many great restaurants in Phoenix that not only have exceptional food but service as well. The manager said they run out of this item normally and it is made from scratch. If this is a constant issue? fix it. You may say food cost etc as the excuse but seriously I am sure this item does not cost that much.  Yes it was good food. Yes our server was good. Will I make a reservation and give the secret code to hold an item, no. Will I be back maybe. For now We will move on and not look back.",

    "text": "I did not leave tonight in love with Beckett's table. My friend and I were in the mood for coffee and dessert and used the mighty Yelp to look at the menu beforehand and at the sight of \"brown butter cake\" my friend was sold.  Take a seat on the (loud) patio and quite a few minutes go by. Our server comes to take drinks -- waters for now and we look over the menu. He leaves for another 10 minutes; it must've been noticed by the manager (or perhaps the owner?) bc she came over to ask if we'd gotten drinks. Maybe I used the wrong word bc I asked if she had anything other than \"run-of-the-mill\" coffee (read: coffee plain vs latte). She seemed taken aback and goes, \"oh, of course it's great; it's a Nicaraguan blend sourced here in Cave Creek\". Calm down, I just wanted to know if it would be coffee with creamer or a latte.  We ended sharing a few apps before dessert: Mac - best part of the meal. I could have done without the prosciutto but not a big deal. Grilled cheese - good, but not overwhelmingly amazing. Not a huge fan of the soup due to the sweetness. Sprouts - I wish they didn't have the bacon in it but they were cooked well.  Then we come to dessert. We asked for the brown butter cake and the waiter looks at us like we have four heads. \"I have worked here for 3 years and nothing like that. We had ice cream once before\". I explained that it was part of their yelp menu and showed him -- he did not seem too interested and did not bother to ask someone else if it had been one of their seasonal menu items. We end up getting the Cracker Jack dessert that is supposed to be caramel-y. Neither of us could really taste the caramel. If not for the Cracker Jacks or chocolate drizzle this would not have much flavor.  The waiter came back and asked us how it was -- we told him we were on the fence. He said we could send it back and get something else so we took him up on that. Ordered the lemon tart. Way too tart and that confectioner sugar gives this a box-y/plastic aftertaste.   Overall? I give it a \"meh\".",

    "text": "Received an invite from a group of my friends to join them at Beckett's Table for Restaurant Week 2014. I was excited to experience this restaurant of which I had heard so much about.   My friend who made the reservation communicated quite a list of \"regulations\" back to us that were given to her over the phone. \"No credit cards, one tab, you have to sit outside,\" etc. We laughed off the Nazi-like first impression, but all got cash out to respect their wishes.   I arrived a little later than the rest of my party (10 total) and as I greeted my friends, was abruptly confronted by the waitress, \"It's time to order. Take your seat.\" She then only handed me the restaurant week specials instead of a full menu. Although I had planned to order something else, I felt pressured to participate in the special to make things a little easier on the waitress who was showing obvious signs of irritation.  While our lovely waitress was taking our order, we had one last friend show up for dinner. As someone stood up to allow her to sit next to a friend she knows, the waitress yelled over the top of our table, \"No switching seats!\" Startled and a little appalled, I couldn't help but laugh in disbelief. The waitress then made a big scene counting out loud, rolling her eyes and huffing loudly. We stated she could just bring the food in whatever order it was originally listed and we would pass it to the correct person. With a forced smile and over enthusiastic tone, she proclaimed it was no problem and she would make it work.   Our last friend was ordering off the full menu to accommodate her vegetarian diet. When asking our waitress for a recommendation between a few dishes, the waitress rolled her eyes and began naming off the printed ingredients loudly then saying, \"if you like all that, then you'll like this.\"  With our group being sensitive to our size, we tried to be as accommodating and gracious as possible to eliminate any additional stress. When it came time to pay the tab, we were prepared to pay with cash but the waitress stated it would be easier to split up the bill since most everyone ordered off the set menu. After turning in our cards, it took her and the management team over 15 minutes to bring our cards back, stating the system was slow. I wouldn't dock stars for this normally because things like that do happen, but after being treated like inmates rather than patrons of a \"fine establishment,\" I am just done with this.  Service is a big factor for me, but I left three stars because if I remember, the food was pretty good. Sadly, the only taste left in my mouth is bitter from the way were treated.  While I have no current desire to revisit this restaurant, I would like to try it one more time to see if maybe the food tastes better without a grumpy hag for a waitress.",

Our waiter gave us a great recommendation that turned us into AZ wine lovers. We started out sharing the deviled eggs, Brussels sprouts with bacon, and the sausage and grits. Flavors were really good. I could eat that sausage and grits for a meal, though it was just a tad too \"soupy\" this particular night.   After filling up on wine and appies, my friend and I split the burger and the vegetable chop salad. This burger is exceptional! Chopped bacon flecks throughout the beef, perfectly medium, Caramelized onions, soft egg bun. Delicious! The chopped veg salad was the perfect, light counterpoint to that decadent burger. Our other friend had the short ribs, which she loved. It was a large serving; she couldn't finish it.  As if that weren't enough, we dove into dessert with enthusiasm. Not sure why but I wanted to try the pecan fig pie. I usually only have pie at the holidays but I was curious. Oh my! Yes, it was sweet, but not cloyingly so. The figs provided a nice, chewy twist.. But the best part was a bite of that pie with the accompanying cream cheese lemon zest ice cream. It's the perfect sweet/tart mouthful, you absolutely must try it!   Kudos to our waiter, who struck exactly the right chord with gracious service, helpful advice, and a truly pleasant demeanor.   I will be back!",

We got there right around 5:00pm the beautiful hotesses greeted us and seated us right away. I would suggest making one though, because the place filled up pretty quickly. We were seated and given menus and the our server let us know about the Restaurant Week Special for $33 We looked and it offered almost everything we wanted to try. SOLD! We decided upon the pork to appetizer, the short rib dinner, and the red velvet cream cheese icing cake. The server also suggested a goat cheese appetizer and I'm so glad that she did! It was a flavor explosion!!! Actually everything was, the meats were cooked to perfection and pulled apart so nicely and each bite left you wanting more. We left very satisfied. They had a great variety of beers, wines, and of course they had an apple cider...cause you know me and my ciders....which was the Woodchuck amber, smooth and sweet ...just how I like it:) I hope we take another trip to Phoenix so that we can eat at Beckett's again! Try to take advantage of their special going on right now! Thanks Beckett's!",

Third (and fourth) the mussels, bland, all we tasted was tomato, and the short ribs, basically beef stew meat on top of plain mashed potatoes. The best part of my meal was the draught Stella Artois, we skipped dessert in fear of what we would get. We will not return.",

The ambience is great, my daughter pointed out all the pigs hidden in the rafters during dinner (something most guests won't search for!). We started with their deviled eggs which today were bacon jam, celery heart, and pecan... delicious! Our 8 year old ate two whole eggs. Also shared the noble bread with mushrooms, figs, and house made ricotta, pretty good, maybe not something I'd order again. My Mom got the roasted red pepper soup (enough to share for 4!) and oh so good! Served so warm in a warm huge soup bowl, a meal in itself. For our entrees, the burger (amazing), the Short Rib (possibly the best we've had in Arizona and we eat a LOT of short rib), the mashed potatoes and vegetables on that dish were great! My husband ordered the Vegetable Enchiladas which did not disappoint, he also (I know right?!) ordered the Green Pork Stew (which I ended up eating too) which was PERFECT! The green chili had a tingling spice on the tongue but so sweet at the same time leaving you wanting more and more. We were just blown away by the variety of entrees we ordered and how great everything was. Dessert: Flourless chocolate cake (in my opinion you need the flour so this was my least favorite item of the night), the Fig and Pecan pie (ORDER IT!), the chocolate covered bacon smores (bacon was great, how could it not be), but again not my favorite dessert, the marshmallows were hard, maybe torched then put back into a fridge(?), it just didn't wow me like I had hoped. Overall, the wine selection is killer and we definitely will be back! Service was on point, thanks Beckett's for a great meal!",

Cheeseburger greasy inside and out.  Ice tea was good So overpriced and so so good food.  Not good",

    "text": "Went to Beckett's for a date night. Made reservations but they did seat us a little late for our set time. Overall great experience. Tried 3 dishes. Mac n cheese was first as the appetizer. They have changed this dish up a bit. No longer baked in a skillet but still a very tasty pasta. The mustard seeds added a nice kick & I would definitely recommend the pancetta. I had the salmon dish. Loved the fish! The grains were a bit simple for the dish but nonetheless I finished my plate. My boyfriend orders the short rib dish which was the best out of the 3. No knife needed with this entree. Meat was cooked perfectly. Amazing flavors and very filling. If we had room I would have loved to try the famous desserts. Will be back to try more for sure.",

Beckett's Table has that magical quality of the most cherished dining experiences in Paris or Milan. It's unfussy yet beautifully courteous and efficient. My pork osso buco confit was the kind of delicious where you eat it slowly to prolong the delight -- and that takes effort because it's so so good.  My full dinner with dessert took about an hour, and I never felt rushed nor overlooked. Everything was wonderful, half-price Arizona wine by the bottle is an excellent deal, and I strongly recommend the Sunday Unplugged acoustic music program.",

Honestly, I don't even remember much about the food and restaurant because the date was just so bad.   My colleague brought up going to Becketts Table for a dinner after work and I wasn't opposed to it because frankly, I needed to try it again and write a review. We had our reservation right when they opened so the restaurant was empty. The restaurant is a lot bigger and more open than what I remember.   I first ordered the beets appetizer which the portion was small, but delectable! My entree I ordered the cast iron petite chicken and it did not disappoint. The chicken was tender and juicy and the vegetables that came with it was a perfect combo. I highly recommend.  For dessert, I ordered the chocolate bacon smores. Get ready to get your hands a little dirty, but oh so worth it!!! Beware that prices are on the high side.",

Next up were the sea scallops which were undercooked, I sent them back. And no I didn't want them cooked more, for $28, I expect my food to come out cooked to perfection. The manager came over with an apology and asked me if I wanted something else she suggested the chopped salad. The salad was good. Last but not least was the bacon bourbon apple cobbler.  They give you a huge portion. The cobbler to ice cream ration is definitely off. I ate 1/4 of it and took the rest to go. Flavorful, but I felt like the apples could have been more tender.  The ambiance is very nice. Our waitress Bethany was great. But due to the flavor of the food or should I say lack of flavor, I will not be back.

I went for the spare ribs which are incredible, tender, flavorful and delicious. I wish they had been more generous with the wine sauce. I just loved it.

You can expect amazing quality every single time you go there. Never once have had a bad meal. I've had so many things to name but my all time favorite which they don't have anymore, was the chicken and dumplings. (Bring it back ;) ) -Pricing is a great value for what you're getting.

We were seated inside, but the outside patio looked very inviting, especially the tables by the fire.   Our daughter recommended the Original Grilled Cheese, so we tried it as an app.  The tasty sandwich is made up of four cheeses with a layer of pancetta in the middle.  Included was a tomato red pepper soup for dipping.  It was delicious. The bread was perfectly crisped. I might ordered it as an entree next time and the server said that it could be done, and that it would come with a bowl of that yummy soup. Our entrees were excellent.  My husband ordered the short ribs and I ordered the pan seared scallops.  The scallops were some of the best that I have ever eaten.  They were cooked perfectly, and the little sear on the top was sweet and spicy, I think with cinnamon.  I think that it is difficult to get scallops right, but they did.  The short ribs were juicy and fork tender.  In addition to good proteins, the veggies were excellent.  The butternut squash puree that was the base for the carrots, onions and cashews on the scallop plate was just sweet enough.",

    "text": "Not at all what I expected and rather disappointing.  I've waited a long time to dine at BT.  I've always tried to find an excuse to go.  So for Mother's Day each year, I pick a fancy restaurant and we go.  I decided to go to BT this year.  As my kiddo whispered upon arrival, \"This isn't fancy, there's no white table cloth.\"  Haha, correct.  But still, I loved the very open and airy decor of the space.  The exposed beams gave it a lofty lodge feel.  Fortunately, they had plenty of parking, often times an issue in the CenPho and Arcadia areas.  We arrived moments before our reservation and were seated promptly.  Our server was very attentive.  He came right over, offered suggestions and offered small talk about the day.  He was a great server.  We ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits and expected light fluffy moist biscuits, but I will caution you not to expect that.  The biscuits are rustic and not fluffy at all.  They were hard, in fact.  Unfortunately, and I'm sure you can guess, we didn't find the biscuits pleasing to our palates at all.  For our entrees, we tried a Steamed Bass and the Mac and Cheese.  The steamed bass came over a mixture of veggies, including broccoli and other root veggies.  The fish entree was edible.  My child didn't find the Mac and cheese pleasing at all and therefore didn't eat it.  I wanted to love this place as so many do.  Alas, none of our food was good to us there.  Definitely not good enough to make a repeat trip.  However, great server and atmosphere.  Return Factor: 20%",

    "text": "The Bad:  -Service; We arrived just as they opened the doors, and despite it only being the two of us we were forced to sit at the bar in very uncomfortable chairs because we didn't have reservations. We assumed this meant they were booked for the night, but when we left nearly 2 hours later the place was still half empty - seems like they could've spared a small table for us. Our bartender wasn't around much either, and seemed like he was always off somewhere else.  -Entree; Both my boyfriend and I ordered the scallops, which was $28 each. To our disappointment, this hefty price only included 4 scallops on the plate, a small spoonful of puree, and nearly half a dozen other assorted bits of food that didn't go very well together. I was tempted to send it back and ask for something else, but since our only waiter was the bartender we didn't see him much when walked off. For nearly $30 we expected something much better.  -Dessert; We split the chocolate-covered bacon s'mores, and we thought it would come already put together or at least be a fairly neat plate - nope! We had to tear up the frozen chocolate-covered bacon and graham crackers ourselves and assemble the s'more, which only succeeded in getting our hands very dirty and sticky by the end. It didn't even taste good, so definitely wasn't worth it.  -Out-dated menus; We were here the Sunday after Valentine's Day, about half a week later, but they hadn't even bothered to change their menus promoting a special Valentine's dinner. Things like this are just lazy, and I'd expect it from a grimy drive-thru place, not a fairly pricey restaurant like this one.  The Good: -Appetizers; Both the grilled cheese and mac & cheese were wonderful. I could eat a huge bowl of the mac for an entree, and probably should've.  -Music; There was live music playing on the night we ate here, and she gave out free CDs and shirts. So at least we felt like we got our money's worth after those scallops... almost.  -Drinks; Sitting at the bar made it easier to order drinks starting out, and at least those were good and arrived quickly - though making a mixed drink isn't exactly difficult. We probably would've gotten more, but since our bartender/waiter kept disappearing that didn't happen.  Overall, I'm very disappointed by our experience at this restaurant, which is unfortunate because we'd heard good things about it from our friends, but our time here proves otherwise. There were some positives, but not nearly enough to make up. I doubt we'll be returning.",

Casual atmosphere and comfortable dining room. Our service was very professional, which is saying a lot these days. We split the deviled egg appetizer and I had the roasted red pepper tomato soup and steamed white bass. Deviled eggs were delicious but could have used more seasoning in my opinion. Soup was a winner-I would recommend it. Had a little twist with the added corn kernels-delicious. White bass was one perfectly.",

I often meet friends for coffee at Mama Java's and right down the strip mall I have seen the place...Beckett's Table. But since I am always there during the day (they are only open in the evening) I had never been able to check them out.  We decided to go with the restaurant week set menu (which looked fabulous!) I had the zucchini cakes to start (amazingly delicious with green goddess dressing) and my spouse had the white grape gazpacho...very different and VERY good! He had the roasted pork loin for an entree which smelled fabulous and tasted even better!  I had the shepherds pie....not an A+ but pretty tasty. But the desserts were to come....and I had one of the most inventive and imaginative one ever: chocolate dipped bacon s'mores! WOW. An amazing experience!  The service was excellent....friendly but not intrusive. And I loved that everyone from the hostess to the servers remembered our name from the reservation.  Thanks for a great evening of food and relaxation! We will be back!",

Maybe I just went on a off night, but my food was not good enough that I would recommend Beckett's table on strength of just the food. I certainly would recommend it to someone that was looking for a cool restaurant in that part of town but I would not sell it as serving food that was more than good in my opinion.   I will probably go back at some point. I think there is a decent chance that my second impression will be better. I perhaps went in with too lofty of expectations the first time.",

Service was nothing if not attentive and helpful.  They had just started their summer menu when we got there so the dishes that were recommended to us from Will weren't on the menu.  We shot from the hip and asked the waiter for help.  Our waiter recommended grits and sausage, it was very good, we also enjoyed their meat balls and their beet salad, however it needed more feta .  I hold back on the fifth star only because their chocolate cake with caramel drizzle was dry and bland.   We sat outside which was wonderful considering the night.  The misters were going which was nice for us however some people out on the patio did not enjoy the misters (curly hair doesn't fair well).  I suggest that if you don't like misters that you ask for either the two tops closest to the building or just eat inside. BTW the wine there is very good and easily paired with the food.",

We started our meal with the goat cheese appetizer,  and it wasnt bad but it also wasn't special, I've had similar appetizers at other restaurants that were much better.  For my entree I was deciding between the short ribs and the pork osso bucco so I asked the waiter and he said the short ribs were the best thing on the menu so I went with that.  If that's the best they have then the rest of the menu must be very sub par.  The short ribs were tender but pretty much flavor less.   The mashed potatoes and veg was nothing I couldnt make at home.  My husband had the chicken wnd his exact review was \"average at best\".  To top it off he was up with stomach issues all night.  The coconut cake was pretty good.  The restaurant is beautiful but the seating is horrible and its extremely loud.  I will not return.",

I could eat them every day.The reason I gave it a 4 is because of the server. She seemed to be annoyed when we asked questions about different items on the menu. Plus the manager stopped by our table and we told her both of us were having a birthday this week.and she said we would be getting a complimentary dessert. The server came by and asked if we wanted dessert and we told her the manager said it was on the house. She snapped at us and said I knpw that. We shared the coconut cake.Amazing! We had ordered coffee with our dessert and asked for a refill after I paid the bill which was over $70 including the 20 percent tip.That seemed to really irritate her. She brought us the coffee, but no more cream. My friend said do you think they charge per cup and she is upset we asked for a refill after the bill was paid or she's unhappy with her tip? The manager was at the door when we left and we told her how fabulous the food was. My regret is not telling her about the server. The food rates 5 stars and I will definitely be back, but make sure I have a different server.",

    "text": "We went to Beckett's Table for the first time tonight. It was highly recommended by a friend for outstanding food, service and very reasonable prices.  The Dining room is inviting and warm, if a bit loud at times. The wait staff was very friendly, prompt and knowledgable about both the items on the menu and pairing the dishes with wines.   We started with the Noshing Board -- a selection of artisan salamis with a cheese, as well as pickled local vegetables -- and the roast beets. Both were very good, with the beets being a surprise hit with a somewhat finicky 18 year-old who \"hates those ugly purple balls of evil.\"   For the main course, my wife had the Osso Buco, I had the roasted and grilled pork chop, and both of the kids had the mussels. All of the dishes were prepared to one degree or another in the wood fired oven; I believe it was hickory as there was none of the characteristic bitter creosote flavors present from mesquite.  The mussel bowls were something to behold: almost overflowing with what appeared to be green-lip mussels that had been oven roasted in the wood-fired oven, then steamed and served in a fennel broth. Very, very well balanced flavors with the oven giving both a subtle smokiness that didn't overwhelm the delicate flavor of the broth and a creamy, almost custard-like texture to the mussels. The Osso Buco was look-at-it-and-it-falls-apart tender and the flavor was incredible. Likewise, the pork chop was delicious, with the oven roasting providing an assertive smokiness that complimented the meat. Be aware that the default temperature of the chop is medium rare, so if you're one of those \"pork must be cooked to death\" before you'll eat it, try something else.   Both the kids were stuffed, but the wife and I decided to try a dessert. She had the fig and pecan pie with cream cheese ice cream, which she assures me was delicious. I had the coffee brulee. If you're not one for very sweet desserts, give the brulee a try; it's lightly sweet due to the caramelized sugar on top, but the custard was almost savory and, although I was assured it was actually custard, the texture was almost a light mousse with a rich coffee and cream flavor.   The only reason I held back the fifth star is the bacon and cheddar biscuits. I've seen plenty of reviews saying they're outstanding, but ours were dry, crispy on the outside and inside with a hint of carbonized bottom-of-the-pan bacon. They were slightly smoky, no hint of cheese and had decidedly burned flavors.   All in all, a very enjoyable meal, and we got out of there for under $200 including tip, a bottle of wine and two cocktails. I'll be going back soon.",

On my first visit I had the chicken and dumplings. It was so blah and boring and corn starchy. The vegetables were under cooked and the broth under seasoned. Also, the chicken in it seemed to be more like mystery meat.  The second time I went I just went with the grilled cheese and soup. Pretty blah as well. They don't seem to season any of their food here??? The third time I went reluctantly for a friends birthday party. This time I tried the over-hyped short ribs. Again, blah. Over priced, over reduced sauce, overly fatty small piece of meat, but the green beans with it were delicious! It was funny because the birthday girl got the chicken and dumplings, even though I warned her, and was extremely displeased. She isn't one to send things back, so when our waitress asked her if she liked her food she just shrugged and said 'meh'. The waitress just made a rude face a walked away.  Oh and the bacon wrapped s'mores are seriously gross, and why do they put bacon in everything here??? EVERYTHING.  ps looking over this review I realize how much I really don't like this place.

First of all, it's cool without being pretentious (i.e. I could wear my jeans and my heels), and priced right for the amount of food and the quality of the service and the food itself. All of this makes up for the fact that there's an absurd amount of opportunity to eat bacon here. Which is a little concerning for a nice Jewish girl like myself and in conflict with the fact that the menu is very accommodating to vegetarians. We had the roasted brussels sprouts to start, and I shared the butternut squash risotto and Scottish salmon. Truth be told, I loved the quinoa salad that comes with the salmon more than anything. Oh and how could I forget the dessert?! It was...interesting. Deconstructed smore with chocolate covered bacon - pass, the bacon was yucky. Coffee creme brulee? Yes, please! ENJOY!",

Did ask for the rolls (served on request). Wow! Those are some GREAT rolls. Perfect temperature, firmness, flavor, etc. Exceptionally well done. Be sure to request the bread.   Had coconut cake with some brown butter ice cream. Delicious, although I think a more aggressively flavored ice cream would have been better. Shrug. Still, very good.   Service was excellent, very attentive, not rushed at all. No, it isn't a cheap place. $30 for the meal, including coffee. Plus tax and tip. I thought it was worth it. I'll be back.   I had rather expected a more formal, stuffy, quiet place. I was very pleasantly surprised. Okay, except the noise level .... Quieter would be better. Sigh. I guess I AM old. Still, I'll go back.",

    "text": "Yelp you have led me astray! I was so excited to try Beckett's Table; great reviews, hip and trendy customers, self proclaimed foodies galore, that totally original decor with the lofted ceilings and exposed wooden beams we are all so excited to see at every damn restaurant in town...but I digress.   I blame Restaurant Week and the menu chosen or should I say, slapped together by BT. I should have known better.   The menu included a drink, which we ordered in this case, a beer. I made mention to the waiter we were debating on menu's but would order the beer anyway since if we went with the RW option, it would be included. This was met with an initial \"No problem,\" but halfway through our first course he came back and said he would be charging us for it because we had not decided on which menu we would be ordering from first. IE: I already rang your beer in a certain format in my POS and am too much of a tool to change it.    First course: onion and potato soup, not bad, creamy and flavorful  Second course: grilled shrimp (rubbery, overcooked shrimp, 4 baby sized), cowboy caviar (fancy way of saying  a teaspoon of corn and beans) avocado mousse (lime and cilantro infused pond scum), and supposed organic arugula salad ...never saw any arugula on my plate.   Desert: bacon chocolate s'mores, graham cracker, housemade marshmallow, caramel sauce, peanut butter mousse ....yeah, not sure how they could mess this up since it's on the actual menu however, the bacon was a greasy mess *yes I realize it's bacon, but once smothered in chocolate it really made for a salty, greasy mess. I think at this point I had about had it.   In fact the waiter and his beer comment made me so angry that I went to find the manager on duty and ask him about it. He looked at me like I was insane and condescendingly told me I was incorrect.   Anyway, the way I look at it, I could forgive your crappy RW menu, because that happens, but I can't forgive your douchy staff and rude comments. I'm out.",

    "text": "Well once again I'm the last one to the party. Beckett's Table has been buzzing away since opening in the old That's Italiano space late last year. I've tried so many times to get in but for whatever reason or another didn't make it. Well finally made it in and I have to say, I wish I hadn't been so damn fashionably late.   A couple of notable thing, the space is killer, rustic-industrial and second, the waiters are hot, especially our beefy ginger waiter Scott, Sam, hmm, maybe Bill? Anyway I can't remember his name but what I do remember was his attention to detail and service. Looking around you can see that all the servers were attentive and helpful to all their guests. I'm just a sucker for a beard, I mean great service.   In case you're wondering who Beckett is, the name refers to local Chef Justin Beckett. The man has got some chops and has nothing to hide in his open kitchen. I love open kitchens, I think its an honest way of sharing how clean and organized a well lubed kitchen works, in other words the orders slid in and out with total ease. The menu is made up mainly of meat + starch with a few flare items that while are mostly comforting, shows the levels of sophistication, especially for a neighborhood kind of restaurant.   At first glance the Country Pate ($12) seemed to be overwhelmed with way to many accompaniments. I'm a mustard and bread only kind of guy, but after trying each delicate bite with a different topping it all made sense. Each component is representative of a different tasting experience. Vinegary whole grain mustard is completely different than sun dried tomato making for an interesting and interactive experience.   Another surprise appetizer was the Creamy Grits & Schreiner's Sausage Trio ($9). I generally avoid grits simply because I've never really had them made well, though Beckett's version is as advertised, creamy and delicious. You can never go wrong with Schreiner's sausages, simply the best as far as I'm concerned. The only real let down was the Grilled Cheese ($9) served with bacon, four cheeses and roasted red pepper tomato soup. Every component was good except that main one, the bread, which was dry and not very tasty which made the entire dish unravel.   Entrees were meat-centric starting with the oh-so-tender Osso Buco ($18). A pork shank braised in its own fat was melting tender, served atop butternut spaetzle and pepper reduction. The braising continues with fork tender Short Ribs ($19) that were big and beefier in flavor thanks to a red wine and herb reduction.  What's a great way to round of such a rich meal? How about a slab of Fig and Pecan Pie ($6)? The sweetness really cuts through the richness from so many savory items. If you're still in the mood for unique, try the hands on Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'mores ($6). Yes, you read it right, slices of thick cut bacon that have been enrobed in chocolate. Once over the novelty, you realize that it's far too messy to finish.  I think the party at Beckett's is only getting started.",

    "text": "We decided to try Beckett's Table because the reviews are generally good and we were going to be on the east side of town.  Clearly, after reading about the short ribs we had to try that.  We also ordered the salmon and, as an appetizer, the mac and cheese.  Service was fair - Both my husband and I had difficulty understanding the server because he spoke quietly and we couldn't hear him over the background music.  (The music was not too loud.)  He didn't tell us the daily special, but I heard what it was from the waiter for the table next door.   We each had a glass of wine. I had something that I'd had in the past so I was satisfied with it, but my husband was less satisfied with his selection -- certainly not the fault of the restaurant.  The mac and cheese - a rather large portion for an appetizer. I enjoyed it very much but my husband was put off by the mustard seed in the sauce. The dish is topped off with pancetta, and our server asked us if we wanted that or not.  I noticed that other reviewers have been unhappy that they were not asked.  I wondered if that changed the policy of always including it because I noticed the next door table server also asked his table if the pancetta was okay.  If you are a light eater, you could certainly order the mac and cheese as a meal, as it was a substantial portion.  The meal -- Short ribs - yes, we have to agree they are extremely tasty! I just had a taste off of my husband's plate but it was delicious--very tender and flavorful.  The salmon - was good but nothing to knock your socks off. I always tell myself, \"don't order something that you make at home\", because it's hard to surpass what you make yourself and love. So I'm going to qualify this with it was prepared exactly as I asked. The accompaniment was unusual - quinoa and spinach with edamame, served cold, which was a little odd under the hot salmon. Not bad, just unexpected.   We were on our way to an event so we by-passed dessert.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Beckett's Table, and will go there again when I have the opportunity and the occasion to be in the area.",

We'll definitely be back to Beckett's.  The service was friendly, the place was unpretentious and welcoming... like being at a friend's house. Hip environment and just what the neighborhood needed.

I went here last night for my birthday dinner and picked this restaurant because I was craving some Shrimp & Grits, and it was listed on the menu.  I ordered them and out came a cast iron skillet of shrimp and sausage in a tomato sauce, with some grits in a bowl on the side...not what I was expecting!  The tomato sauce was really bland and gave no flavor whatsoever to the shrimp.  The grits were nice and creamy, but nothing special enough to save the dish.  I fished out the sausage, which had a nice heat to it, and just ate that.  The cheddar bacon biscuits on the side were quite good, and I was glad I had them.  I also had the Tomato Ricotta salad to start...I don't think the lettuce was washed very well because about half of the bites tasted like dirt, but I enjoyed the fresh ricotta.  My family enjoyed their food more than me, but I was blown away by the staff's service and concern that I had not gotten enough to eat.  They wanted to bring me another dish and when I declined they even offered to package me up a meal to go, A+ for service!  I declined and opted to order dessert...it was my birthday after all...and when the bill came they had removed both my entree and the dessert!  I will say the white sangria was excellent and the mac & cheese with pancetta was delicious...I would be willing to give Beckett's another try...just not when I am in the mood for shrimp & grits!",

First, I was greeted with a wonderfully warm and professional hostess, who seated me and then promptly gave me an overview of what was featured on each of the three menus she handed me (huge plus in my opinion). Her knowledge about the restaurant and its offerings was unlike anything I have ever seen. We got into a conversation about wines, and I was so impressed by her ability to truly understand what she was talking about.  Second, my server was amazing! He was a wordsmith when it came to talking to me about the menu. I asked him to explain several items that were on the menu to me and he was extremely knowledgeable about not only what was included in the dishes, but the process that the chefs went through with each component of the dish. It really helped me appreciate the chef and his vision for his menu.   Third, THE FOOD!!!! It was amazing. I started with the baked feta appetizer, and it was a \"bouquet\" of flavor (how the server described it). Followed by steamed bass over seasonal vegetables with a pistachio crumble. Everything was perfectly cooked, fresh, and perfectly balanced.   Everything was amazing.   I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks.",

    "text": "Went with a group of friends and we shared several apps and dishes. We tried one of the specials, duck confit, as well as deviled eggs and bacon biscuits for appetizers. For meals we shared cast iron petite chicken, pork osso buco confit (based on several Yelp reviews), and fork tender short ribs. Dessert consisted of the fig & pecan pie and chocolate dipped bacon s'mores.   Our overall assessment was TOO SALTY. I actually love salt and could eat it plain, so the duck was ok to me but even I could tell that it was too salty. It was basically inedible for everyone else. The bacon biscuits were good, maybe a bit dense/hard, but are huge and only come with three (we split one and it was fine, but some might find this annoying).   We had the same saltiness issue with the pork, though 2 people ordered it and one was worse than the other. The summer veggie spaetzle that came with the pork was a bit off putting (green and quite a large serving) and no one ate it - I would switch it out if you can. The short ribs were very similar to a pot roast. It smelled exactly like canned cat food but tasted ok - the mashed potatoes were excellent and the highlight of this dish for me. Everyone was actually most impressed with the chicken! It was tender, moist, and seasoned perfectly.  As for dessert, the fig and pecan pie was very dry and we didn't finish it. The cream cheese citrus ice cream was refreshing and interesting. The s'mores were awesome. I wish there was more marshmallow (amazing) and the chocolate covered bacon was entire strips of bacon covered in chocolate and very, very good. I could have done without the peanut butter but other people liked it.  The ambiance was really nice and our server was great.",

Potato Leek Soup - was expecting something savory, but it was quite sweet.  Not what I expected and I could not finish the entire bowl.    We ordered and waited at least 25 minutes for our food.  The cast iron chicken was okay, but again very sweet, as was the stuffing.  I was expecting something savory akin to Thanksgiving Stuffing.  One person in our party ordered the short ribs and they were delicious.  We also ordered the pecan pie, which was good, but crust was definitely overcooked.  Would definitely give this restaurant another chance, loved the atmosphere and the vibe.  The food needs to be taken up a notch to correspond with the pricing.",

    "text": "I went here for AZ Restaurant Week last night with my mom and sister. the ambiance was very nice. the outside area was cute, and it actually wasn't that hot around 7 pm. The inside was cool too - not too loud.   The food was awesome. I had the roasted red pepper & tomato soup and it hit the spot. I also tried the wood oven roasted beets from my mom. The presentation of them was beautiful and they were quite delicious. As for the other appetizer, I would not get the veggie chop salad.. it wasn't even sad, it was closer to pathetic. We noticed there were different sized portions for restaurant week and normal menu customers, so maybe the salad was a victim of that size downgrade.   For the entree I had the pork osso buco confit and I was in heaven. It was perfectly tender and was falling off the bone! Perfect. The spaetzle it came with was pretty good too. It was supposed to come with some spinach in it, but mine didn't. I wasn't feeling jerky enough to complain about it though. I also tried some of the seared Scottish salmon my mom got. It was crispy on the outside and perfectly medium? cook on the inside. I don't order salmon at restaurants much, but it was way better than I've ever made it (not that I'm a pro or anything).   Desserts were awesome as well. The vanilla bean creme brulee was a perfect dessert for me. My sister had the chocolate flourless cake. It was another victim of the size downgrade. I wouldn't suggest getting that unless you want two little chocolate nugget sized pieces. She said it tasted good though.",

The mac & cheese probably would have been amazing, but to be different, they put mustard / mustard seed in it - which is not listed on the menu - so it's very strange and confusing when you taste it.   I had the short ribs entree, and it was very good, if a little small a portion for the price. My friend had the roast chicken and thought it was ok, not bad but not spectacular. She did say the stuffing was very dry.   They did have a pretty diverse craft cocktail menu so this might be a cool place to grab a couple of drinks on a date or something - the inside really does have a cool vibe - it just wasn't stellar food.",

Last time we ordered the fig and pecan pie with the cream cheese and lemon zest ice cream.  This time I just wanted the ice cream.  Soooooooo good.  We sat out in the garden patio.  The heater was on making the temperature just right.  Our server was pleasant and made sure we always had bread.  That's one thing we didn't know from last visit.  Bread is given upon request so make sure you ask for some.    We love this place.  I encourage everyone to give it a try!",

When we asked for our soup to come out first, it came out about a minute before our fish entree, and only when I reminded her.  On the other hand, they kindly split the fish for us.  Also, the soup portion is huge.    We didn't much enjoy the food.  Our server suggested the mahi mahi special ($30) and REALLY played it up so much that we changed our original order and got that.  It just wasn't very good to either one of us.  We also didn't personally care for the red pepper and tomato soup ($7).  The complimentary bread (onion cheddar) was really NOT good.  The beer (blonde ale) was reasonably priced at $5, but not to my husband's liking.  At 0 out of 4, we would not return.",

    "text": "While Beckett's Table initially doesn't seem like a place to take little kids, they treat families right, allowing parents o enjoy a great meal in an adult atmosphere while giving kids the simple food they need.  We had a great experience with aC (6 years old) and would surely come back again if we're in the area.  SIDES:  The bacon cheddar biscuits are some of the best biscuits I've ever had.  You must try these.  They aren't light, flaky, and airy like traditional southern biscuits, but are crunchy on the outside with tons of cheese, bacon, and even some scallions.  The apple butter adds a sweetness and plays well with the rich, flavors of the biscuits.  MAINS:  The fork tender short ribs were just as advertised.  No knife needed and full of rich flavors.  These were top notch, paired well with the mashed potatoes and veggies, and highly recommended.  There are a lot of other dishes that looked great, but I'd have to order this again next time.  I had a bit of AC's B Burger, which was top notch - juicy with a light brioche bun that was just enough to stand up to the juices and grease, and to hold up the large burger and thick bacon.  The fries were good as well, but not super memorable.  DESSERT:  We had the cinnamon sugar donut holes which were very good.  You get four large, crunchy cake donuts served over dollops of banana pudding of banana pudding and drizzled with chocolate and caramel.  The cinnamon sure gives it a churro-like flavor but it has a lot more heft.  DRINKS:  With 1/2 price Arizona wine on Sundays, we ordered a bottle of Dos Cabezas red (a light GMS blend) for $20.50, which is roughly what you would pay at retail.  You can essentially get a bottle of local wine without the markup.  KIDS MENU: The kids menu is chock full of well prepared food that kids love like sliders, PB&J, and quesadillas.  aC kept it simple by ordering pasta with butter, which was cooked  al dente and not swimming in butter, along with fruit as her side.  She also got a fresh chocolate cookie included with her meal.",

Drinks: I got a sangria; it was rather strong and bursting with fruit flavor.   Food: I ordered the grilled cheese and roasted tomato soup.  The grilled cheese was toasty and light. The soup had a lot of flavor and spice. The serving size was perfect - small but filling (for me!)  The food came out within 20 minute or so.  The guy I was with ordered chicken and said it was good. However, he initially wanted salmon, and they were out.  The s'mores have bacon (I do not eat bacon), and I really wanted to try them. But, instead I got peach cobbler; it was good!

The descriptions of the menu items sound like you're ordering the most wonderful thing in the world and then you eat it and it's just OK. The food is pretty overpriced in the sense that once you are done eating and you get the bill it seems like maybe they're charging you more than they should have for the food you actually ate. I've never sent anything back, but I've also never told someone they had to eat at Beckett's. Overall: meh.",

Although the location is in a strip mall, the atmosphere is cool but casual, and we were seated next to (but not outside on) a great patio area. They have a nice wine selection, and some great mixed drinks, including a Pimm's Cup. I had a nice glass of Pinot Noir that was recommended by the bartender.  The only disappointment was the appetizer we all shared.  It was a brussels sprouts dish, and it could have used a bit more flavor/seasoning.  Kind of bland, something I could have just rustled up at home. Oh well.  The main dishes, however, did not disappoint. I had the osso buco confit with butternut spaetzle...delicious! My co-horts had the chicken and dumplings (homemade dumplings...fab) and the short ribs (these were good, but not as great as I would have hoped...needed \"something\" else).  The staff was great and attentive, and I will definitely go back!",

We had seen it was always featured as one of the great restaurants in Phoenix and thought this would be a perfect time to check it out. Making a reservation was super simple and stress free and they sat us opon arrival.   We went around 6:15pm and the place was starting to get filled, but towards the end of the dinner the place was packed and there looked to be a wait for tables.   Our waiter was very nice and recommended certain menu options when we asked. I ended up getting the steamed white bass with grits and farm vegetables. My sister got the meatloaf which she said was excellent. My fish was cooked perfectly. For starters we both go the vegetable chopped salad which was so fresh and the dressing was delicious.   For dessert we both got the chocolate dipped bacon smores. Minus the fact you are eating bacon and chocolate combined this was so yummy. I felt like I just needed a little fire pit to make the perfect campfire dessert. The entire meal was $30.00 per person that included starter, main, dessert and a free drink.   In the middle of the dinner my sister and I had done some tweeting of our meal to remember and next thing we know the chef comes out and introduces himself and thanked us for spreading the word about Beckett's Table. Totally not expected but really nice he took the time out of the busy kitchen to see how we enjoyed our meal.   I hope to go back and try their short ribs!",

    "text": "So a few weeks ago, I took a trip to PHX to visit with friends and prior to going there I had made a list of food places that I wanted to try.  Beckett's Table was one of the places that was at the top of the list and boy....  It did not disappoint!  First of all, lemme tell you about the overall general area that the restaurant is in..  This place is in a strip mall!!  A strip mall of all places.  So I managed to find some parking and as I get out of my vehicle when I realized that this place is super nice!  It's like an upscale restaurant in a ghetto of sorts..  It just did not fit in with the surroundings which was an awesome surprise!  I walked into the restaurant thinking \"I'm not dressed right for this place.\" as I was wearing shorts and a t shirt.  I was a bit early, so I checked into the hostess stand and was greeted by the staff which were overall super nice.  I moved over to bar and got me  a \"kilt lifter\" beer by FOUR PEAKS.  Can't get this in Hawaii I know that.  When the rest of my party arrived, we were guided to our seats where we I discovered that they also have communal tables on extended lanai on the outside of the restaurant.  Pretty cool if you wanna bring friends.  So we order started by ordering some appetizers like some soup and grilled cheese.   Both were awesome!   I did read that Beckett's grilled cheese was rated the best in PHX according to an article I read a while ago. I must say that it was definitely up there especially since it came with tomato basil soup.  Dinner came shortly after in which I had order the Pork Oso Buco..  It was awesomely good with fall off the bone meat!  The dinner ended with some desserts which was also good.  All in all, it was a great experience!  I will definitely be back some day.  But I know PHX has more to explore..",

For appetizers try the grilled cheese or the sausage and grits. The chicken and dumplings are an absolute must, but the cast iron chicken and spare ribs are great too. Full flavor and cooked perfectly. Save room for dessert too; they are all wonderful.",

Everything is so amazing that now when I go I just tell them to bring me anything on the menu.  Beet salad that is pretty close to Woflgang Pucks Spago beet salad, Shrimp and grits are delish (and I am a pretty strict judge of grits), short ribs that make you want to lick the plate, and oh the desserts.  Fig & Pecan pie with cream cheese ice cream will make you want to come back just to have dessert as the entree.",

    "text": "Food 2 stars Breads/desserts 3.5 stars  Cute place. Food, not so 'cute'  I was a little disappointed with the food here. I read the reviews, and was very excited about trying this place. We ordered a ton of food and I was unimpressed.    Breads are yummy goodness! Another bread basket please! :)  The bacon biscuits were good, but I think ours were a little dry that night, maybe will give it another chance next time.  Tried to order the grape salad, out, so... Chopped salad looks like a 5 year old threw some iceberg lettuce on the plate, but when you eat it it grows on you a little, it has a lot of sweet veggies and they also tossed in some micro pieces of caramelized sugar oats? A little surprising, but not bad.  Dressing is on the bland side.  Chicken pate is decent.  This is another dish that grows on you.  It is a very chunky pate speckled with veggies.  It is great when you eat it with the roasted red peppers and cheese that come on the plate.  Sausage and polenta, meh. I've had better.  It's good, but nothing to knock your socks off.  Matzo ball soup-bland, uninteresting and beyond mediocre. It is also a ridiculously large portion.  The osso bucco on the menu is a fraud.  It isn't osso bucco at all.  I understand the concept of the restaurant, so I wasn't expecting a completely traditional dish, but come on,  the meat was a bit dry and was saturated with an anise flavor which is not what comes to mind when I'm thinking osso bucco.  Can we get a hint of a tomato based sauce here?   Chile pork stew.  Very heavy  flavors, concentrated sauce, not really my thing.  Cornbread is good though.  Shepherd's pie was okay, the sauce was good, but just a little too concentrated, heavy, and very salty.  It needed more of a starch to cut the sauce down.  This is another dish with a slight identity crisis.  But sadly, the best dish so far.    Desserts were great.  The pecan and fig pie was delish. Crust was like the outside of a fig newton cookie and the fresh figs were the highlight of the entire meal.  The cream cheese ice cream is very different and decadent.  This is the one thing on the menu that we all wished was a little larger in size!   On the lighter side, the blueberry and pear cobbler was bright and naturally sweetened by the fresh fruits within.  Cobbler to ice cream ratio a little off, but it was good nonetheless.  Pimm's cup cocktaill is really good. Very light and fresh.   I guess if I want upscale home cooked food, I will just have to continue cooking it myself. :(    We will come back for dessert and drinks.",

Like others have said, the interior was kinda like a mini Chelsea's kitchen. Server was on her game and very helpful. Had downloaded the menu from the site so was ready to order a Rib eye (?), but was informed that the old menu was on the site! *SMH*. Online world Chef - please be on top of that.    Apps - super creamy grits & schreiner's sausage trio and the oven roasted organic beets. I would never order the beets, but it was friggin good!   Dinner - Mrs. had the pork osso buco confit, I had the roasted & grilled pork chop. This goodness under $20! This is why this place is packed all the time!   Desserts - Started with the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores. OK, alot of reviews that this was unbelievable, super good, etc.. I love Bacon! But this was kinda meh. After a good meal, you want something equally good for dessert. We ordered the death by chocolate... Redemption!   Besides that bad table location, everyone had a great meal. The service was excellent and the prices were reasonable. Overall, I will be back!",

The braised short ribs were incredibly tender, didn't need a knife at all and the mashed potatoes were great! perfect creamy texture but so flavorful on it's own and the green beans were cooked to just the right crispy-ness.   by the time dessert came around, we were already so full we almost didn't get it, but we opted for the peaches and cream which came with a delightful, light mousse atop poached peaches topped with streussel.. it was very tasty.  it was a nice sweet end to a wonderful meal.",

The sauce was very smokey, which actually tasted better the longer it sat, the meatballs could have been served \"naked\"...they were delish!!!  We both got the green chile stew for our entrees, my husband enjoyed it, I thought it was a bit on the sweet side, especially as it cooled off.  Dessert was the s'more with chocolate covered bacon, a dish you definitely have to try to appreciate.  Took a few bites to get used to it, but it was really tasty, the marshmallow was fantastic.

    "text": "Beckett's has fast become the \"it\" restaurant in the Arcadia scene or maybe it's the lack thereof of good restaurants in Arcadia like Beckett's that makes this place overflowing with diners.   Thanks to Yelp, I came across this \"hot on Yelp\" restaurant and went here with a couple of friends, and we were surprised with how busy this place was that we found ourselves waiting for a table for an hour. My first visit I attempted to order the shortrib and was dismayed they ran out. So, I ended with the cast iron petite chicken. Which was good. My first visit was Nov. of 2010. let's flash forward to 1/14/2011.  I went again with my friend Sara to see if Beckett's could still win us over a second time, Parlor has the magic everytime I eat there as well as Geisha's HH. We both agreed that we would get the mussels as an appetizer. And this time I called (on a thursday night) to see if I could make a reservation for friday night, and learned that the prime reservation slots were taken, so, this makes me assume that I must make a reservation on a Tuesday or Wed. at least, sheesh! ok, back to the food...  the mussels were really soft, and the sauce/gravy was divine meaning it wasn't thick and creamy no, it had a good texture and you could really taste the fennel, and the wine, it's GOOD. This time I was able to order the fork tender short ribs and let me just say this, it's more than fork tender, it's YUM! forget the sides just give me two short ribs! I now understand why they run out....mmm yum! Sara got the beef bourguignon shepherd's pie which was good but not great unlike the short ribs. Anywho another good experience at Beckett's and will come back again. Oh as for desserts, as a dessert fiend, pass on it and look elsewhere, they're quite meh, and tammie coe's is up the street. so hurrah for beckett's!",

Overpriced and below average with a hefty dose of hipster attitude to try to hide its inadequacy. The waiter explained the charcuterie plate as \"cheese, some special sauce, and of course nuts\". He couldn't suggest an entree and barely understood the difference between red and white wine.  So for $95 a couple we got.....taken advantage of badly. Never again.",

We were able to carry on decent conversations here compared to some other places we tried. The beet appetizer was like nothing I've ever tasted. The sweetness of the beets and the spice accompanying it was unique and delicious. The Mac n Cheese appetizer was creamy and comforting.  My husband and I split the chopped vegetable salad. This was very refreshing in the summer heat.  The pork OssoBucco was tender and a little too salty. It was accompanied by a spaetzle which was even more salty. The beef short ribs were tender and tasty. Maybe a touch too much salt.  3 people at our table had the salmon. It must have been good because they did not say a word.  The broccolini side was perfect as far as sides go. I'd like to go back and try this place again.",

My boyfriend and I went at 5:30pm, which of course the restaurant was completely empty. We didn't have reservations, and they looked around the restaurant for empty tables....pretty sure they were all empty. But by the end of our meal, the restaurant was nearly full. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, which I love. She made sure our sangria glasses and waters were always full. The sangria was delicious...and after my ballsy attempt at finishing the half carafe, my asian cheeks were the same color as the drink.  For appetizer, we shared the sausage and grits. We have never had grits before, but if it always tastes like this I'm sold! We scrapped the bowl clean.  For dinner, my bf had the short ribs and I had the Osso Bucco. The short ribs are fork tender...absolutely melt-in-your mouth goodness and surprisingly not extremely rich. He was able to finish the full meal it was that delicious. The Osso Bucco was tender and so flavorful, I preferred mine over his but that's still up in debate.   For dessert, my eyes were on the pecan pie. It was sweet, as pecan pies usually are. But the crust was flaky and complimented the pecan sugar layer perfectly.   We left the restaurant with a full belly and smiles on our face (don't forget my red cheeks too). Definitely a go to place for a special occasion or romantic dinner.",

I had the bass which changes daily but mine was inventive and flavorful.   Start with a beet puree, add braised bok choy, roasted cauliflower and baked garbanzos. Other dishes at the table- short ribs, burger, and beef bourguignon shepherd's pie. Everyone was stoked!  Handcrafted cocktails, hearty farm-to-table dishes. Go! If you don't have plans after go for the fig pecan pie and let me know how it is.",

    "text": "We went to Beckett's for my dad's birthday celebration, and it did not disappoint!  I must note the service at this place: I could not have asked for better. The server, Andrea, was SO knowledgable, obviously a localvore, and unobtrusively personable. We swapped foodie faves, and she gave us great tips. That being said - our party was not the \"server's dream\" because we did not order drinks or apps, and shared dessert, but she treated us with priority anyway. The bus staff was so good - ours took personal pride in what he did, and seemed to sweep by as a shadow to clear empty plates and fill glasses. When we engaged him, he was friendly and professional. Top notch service for real.   I'll start with the (minor!) things that weren't super awesome:  When I called in the reservation, I was told the patio was \"prime real estate\", but I have to disagree. It's right on Indian School, so there isn't much to work with as far as ambiance is concerned. Although, the outdoor fireplace is pretty sweet. The front of the patio is practically in the parking lot, so it didn't appeal to me. We opted for an inside table, which was awesome. The open kitchen is really cool, the decor is tasteful and quirky.  The only other things that didn't blow me away were the cheddar bacon biscuits (we didn't know they were going to bring table bread before the meal - asiago and whole wheat rolls that are plenty without ordering biscuits with dinner) and the portion size on the side of grits. The cheddar bacon biscuits were so-so, and lacked the abundance of bacon we expected. The closest comparison we have is the cheddar bay biscuits at (wipe that judgment off your face)...Red Lobster. Just skip the buscuits, kay? As for the grits... At a place like this, everyone is tasting everyone else's food, so the small portion of grits was a bummer.   SPEAKING OF GRITS, woah. So good, so good. Order them. Do it.  They andouille and shrimp entree (spicy!) comes with the side of grits, and both were delicious. Our party also ordered the Osso Buco and the Pork Chop. I just cannot say enough about the 'Buco. It was absolutely perfect. Like, mind blowingly delicious.The side of spaetzle was awesome with the green apples and red onion, and the flavor combo was excellent. The chop came with baked beans that were truly excellent, kind of smoky, and well-paired with the grilled chop. Don't be fooled by the \"side\" of cole slaw - it's more of a 3-bite garnish, but good none the less.  They brought my dad the coconut cake with brown butter ice cream for his birthday dessert. I don't do coconut, but the homemade ice cream was great! We also ordered the creamsicle creme brulee, and it was...fine. The crust didn't realy crack, and was a little chewy, but the flavor of the brulee was good. Order coffee with this, if you do.   WHEN (not \"if\") we go back...I'm stoked to try the brussells, the bacon s'more dessert, and the chicken and dumplin' entree. Yes please.",

My husband has had the smoked and grilled pork chop with cowboy caviar and he basically licked his plate. The time before, he had pork osso buco. And again....he basically licked his plate.  I have had the cheeseburger and the tomato soup/grilled cheese (appetizer, but I had it for a meal). I loved both of them.  The desserts are AMAZING. Everyone needs to try chocolate covered bacon - so order the s'more, stat.   Beckett's table also has a great ambiance. It isn't too fancy, but just feels perfectly trendy with just the right touch of feeling romantic (if you want it to).   Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "The cocktails at Beckett's Table are fantastic, they've got a lot of character and plenty of options for those who don't like really sweet drinks. The Palmaire, while being a fruit base, is a bitter and refreshing drink.   With Beckett's being only a block away from my home, I was just dropping by for drinks when something caught my attention...bacon s'mores! I had to have it. The plate arrived and I can't even express how excited I was to try this. Three sticks of bacon were carefully coated in chocolate. The marshmallows were torched with a nice carmel colored exterior, and carmel drizzled onto the plate. Every bite of it was as good as the last. I do have one criticism and that is I'm not sure the peanut butter complimented the dish, in my opinion it took away from the bacon. Since all of the ingredients were separated on the plate, it was easy enough to avoid. I would have preferred more of a carmel crunch to go with the bacon. Regardless, it was amazing and definitely worth trying!   As for the atmosphere, it's got energy, the exposed wooden rafters make it feel modern/country especially with the brass pig overlooking all of the tables. Bring your parents, bring your friends, bring a date, coworkers, it's a one size fits all atmosphere. Great place!",

Not super exciting, but decent.    A few lingering questions:  Why was the red wine served cold?  Why were the roasted beets served with a teaspoon?  Why was the warm cooked salmon entree served atop a cold salad (ice-cold cornbread croutons and all)?  Call me uber-traditional but I think I prefer hot-on-hot and cold-on-cold.    And finally: why did they serve the light, delicious homemade peanut butter for the s'mores in an ugly wet dog food-looking smear?  Oh, Beckett's.  You perplex me so.",

    "text": "We wanted to love this place - we really did; and first impressions were great as we arrived before they opened.  The bartender came out to greet us, offering us a table on the patio while they prepared the final touches for their 5pm opening.  He even brought us water and allowed us to order a bottle of wine while we waited the 20 minutes for the restaurant to open its doors.  Once seated at our table inside the restaurant it began to fill rapidly which we took as a very good sign.  We also appreciated the good service by our waiter & bartender who were both prompt and attentive.  With all the wonderful accolades this place receives, we first worried that perhaps we'd left our test buds at home - but then decided that wasn't the case, because the chicken meatballs & smoky tomato sauce we started with as an appetizer had plenty of flavor, just not to our liking. Please don't misunderstand, the entrees we had (Osso Bucco and Short Ribs) were beyond tender, but what both dishes did lack were flavor.  We found both to be just blah ... no other way to describe them.  Then the award winning fig and pecan pie arrived, and while we had no problem finishing it, we just couldn't give it the award winning kudos the name and server enticed us with.   However, we did like the energy of the place & always prefer to support locally owned restaurants with owners who put their hearts and souls into their work.  It was obvious this was the case here, as all were present and working hard.  We just wish we would have been equally impressed with the taste of the food!",

This was one of the closer things nearby, so me and my coworkers headed to Beckett's Table.   The atmosphere is pretty nice. The restaurant looks swanky and modern. The service is great. Our waitress was very prompt and attentive.   The menu was tiny.   There are only a handful of main courses available. And they are full of 'fancy' ingredients that just seem to complicate what should be a simple dish. The wine list is extremely long. Like, three pages long. I really wish the menu was that long, but alas it fits on one side of a place-mat.   And let's not forget how pricey this stuff is. You won't get a main dish for under $15. And some dishes run into the $25 range.   The food itself was okay. They give you these small rolls while you wait for you meal. Those were awesome. My friends told me that their meals weren't too bad. Nothing spectacular, but not horrible either. My first meal was too spicy, so I sent it back for another cut of fish (salmon). The fillet was tiny and not overly warm.   For dessert, we ate a piece of chocolate cake type thing. It was okay.   Overall, the service is great. If you're into wine, there is a lot to pick from. The food is overrated and so are the prices.",

    "text": "actually 2.5 stars, and that is to say, nothing memorable.  I  read tons of reviews on this place and wanted to love it.  Unfortunately from food to service, it just didn't deliver.  Save the spring vegetable spaetzle, nothing was good.  Here's what we had...  the acclaimed cheddar bacon biscuits - positively overcooked.  The outsides weren't just crunchy; they were rock hard.  The insides were dry and flavorless.  the zucchini pancakes - tasty but undercooked and greasy.  b burger - though ordered well done, it came medium.  I know some foodies think well-done is gauche, but that's what my mom wants, that's what she orders so just deal with it and bring her what she wants.  And don't act all pissy about it when she sends it back.    vegetable chopped salad - such promise on the menu that fails to impress on the plate.  As other reviewers have said, it's an amateur salad and utterly lacking flavor or originality.    grilled salmon with panzanella - salmon was well-cooked but nothing special.  The panzanella salad was an interesting twist that just didn't work for anyone at the table - cornbread croutons that failed to absorb any flavors.  frankly the panzanella flavors just didn't mesh.  you were eating croutons, cucumbers, tomato, and some dressing.      my glass of Pickett Fence pinot noir tasted like the bottle had been sitting open for a couple days.    my other comments about the food are get over the bacon in everything and use the raw corn sparingly.  Sometimes it just doesn't work and frankly gets boring when one or the other is in so many dishes on the menu.  Lastly service was poor.  The aforementioned b burger was sent back to be refired.  Should that take 20 minutes?  Certainly not when the restaurant is just gearing up for the peak hours... Beyond that, our server was unattentive and mistakenly laboring under the idea that he was charming.  This is a nitpick, but if I hand you my credit card with the bill, you should probably hand it back to me when you're done not to my Dad.  Pay attention just a bit.    With so many new, fun places to try in Phoenix these days, we won't be back.  Blah, trying to hard to be hip, and just not that good.  Doesn't hold a candle to FnB.",

We easily made a reservation in the evening of and had a less than packed place to enjoy a great meal with three little ones.   The wait staff were wonderful. They knew to bring the kids food first and all of the entrees were excellent. I had the veggie plate )what an undersell of a name- amazing blend of roasted vegetables, rice patty with a great kick, a great sauce and a small salad. With a big group, we were able to taste a lot of things. Highlights include their spinach spaetzle, all things pork, and roasted vegetables. My sister couldn't stop licking the plate of their quinoa (white bass), my husband said his plate looked underwhelming but got better and better with each bite (osso buco) and my nephew inhaled his short ribs. All in all, the entrees were outstanding.   Dessert was a blend. I was underwhelmed by their pecan pie and really turned off by their lemon ice cream. But the donut holes and coconut cake were a big hit.   All in all a huge birthday success! I look forward to going back  And super impressed by their gluten free options!",

I was wishing for more light, fresh, more farm to table fair.",

Apps -   Grits with Schreiners sausage...... painfully good Chx meatballs with smoky tomato sauce..... even more painfully delicious Zucchini pancakes.... yummy, but not something I'd order again. The texture was off for me, and the goddess sauce wasn't very punchy Razz chops salad... no thanks, not my cup of tea. would not repeat.   Dinner -  Fork tender short ribs were out of this world tender & flavorful. Beautiful green & yellow bean with a soft potato mash beneath. Delightful!  It seems like they have a really high standard for themselves and take pride in what they do. I respect that, and like the dining experience created by following that ethic.",

    "text": "I was really on the fence if I should give this review 3 or 4 stars.  Stopped in yesterday for the s'mores milkshake. This was my first visit to Beckett's Table and I've been wanting to try it ever since I heard a review about their chocolate covered bacon! The chocolate covered bacon is served as part of their s'mores dessert. For Arizona Dairy month they have made this dessert into a milkshake.  The milkshake was tasty but just ok in my opinion. I think it had one or two too many flavors going on for my preference. It had the standard s'mores ingredients of marshmallow, chocolate, graham crackers and also had an addition of bacon, caramel and peanut butter. I think if the peanut butter had been left out it would have been way better! (I like peanut butter but it just seemed to take away from the other delicious flavors instead of add to them.)   The part of the shake I was looking forward to the most was the chocolate covered bacon! Sadly, the piece that came with the shake tasted burnt. (This coming from someone who likes their bacon very well done!) But when we mentioned it to our server he was very nice and brought us out two more pieces of chocolate covered bacon to make up for it. And those ones tasted better. =)  Speaking of the service...it was great. This is the reason for the 4 stars. The atmosphere is lovely. They are very attentive on filling up your water glass and making sure you enjoyed everything. It was great till the end, when we wanted to get our check...which took a while. But I don't hold that against them...our server seemed to have too many tables to look after.   I hope to stop in again to try their food when I have more time.",

We were a party of four and to say that the service was lacklustre would be very generous. My wife's white sea bass was actually served so cold it might have come straight from the refrigerator with the exception it had obviously been cooked, so that would indicate it was left out to get stone cold while the other dishes were prepared. There were four of us and although my food was excellent the food served to our two guests was very ordinary. But for the extremely poor, bordering upon rude, service, the evening would have been at least OK after the sea bass was exchanged for a warmer one, which took far too long since the other three of us had almost finished eating when the replacement arrived and was thrown in front of my wife. I have never had such poor service in any decent restaurant and unfortunately I don't feel I can recommend Beckett's table to anyone. No one visited our table to apologize for the cold food and I suspect the server did not even mention it to anyone in management because I cannot see any reasonable manager failing to at least visit our table to apologize.",

She was able to describe the food perfectly and made terrific recommendations. I was in the mood for Rose and nothing quite hit the spot(they were all on the dry side). But, if my husband hadn't ordered a glass of wine, we would have ordered local Rose that is in a can (yes that sounds weird but Laurita highly recommended it). She said there was enough for 2 servings and I only felt like 1 so I didn't want to waste it. But we will be trying it next time and we'll be supporting a local business.  We shared the chop salad which was delicious. We got the dressing on the side (for me) but it had a wonderful taste to it. I got the BT Veg Plate which I could not recommend more. It wasn't that filling but usually vegetables come grilled or steamed and this was beyond my expectations. My husband got the Chicken and said it was delicious. It was very filling. It looked really good.   We will definitely be back. We can't recommend it more!",

I can honestly eat an entire basket of these biscuits and a gallon of this apple butter any day of the week. We also had to order the fig and pecan pie for dessert. It was all so tasty! If you can, try sitting at the community table. You can meet some amazing people over a meal this way. We met a wonderful couple who we truly enjoyed talking with.",

He seemed either very inexperienced or annoyed and didn't want to offer suggestions. We ordered dinner. He wasn't very helpful with that either. The lights were dim and the menu was hard to read and as I mentioned previously we hadn't been here before. We split the chicken entree (which was fabulous) and a large salad (it had a champagne vinaigrette). Both items he brought to the table on one dish, not split. When he asked how we liked the salad we said it was awful. He did not offer a replacement or to take it off the bill. At the end of our meal he boxed our leftovers IN ONE BOX! Who does that??? The receipt says our server was PePe at table #64. If it weren't for the hostess and the yummy chicken I would have given only a one star rating.",

    "text": "This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. My fiance and I were in Phoenix for vacation and wanted to try out the local spots that everyone loves. We came during the week about an hour before closing (we got the hours mixed up). I usually hate going late like that since that's when service declines as the staff is just trying to clean up and hurry home. I was so wrong! As we walked in, it was pouring rain and there were about 4 other parties in the restaurant so we were seated immediately. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and informative in what the popular dishes were but not pushy. I feel that sometimes wait staff really pushes the alcohol and appetizer sales. We started off with ordering the Shrimp, Sausage & Super Creamy Local Grits which were delicious but the portion is not much for two people. Had we not planned on ordering dessert, I would recommend that it's just enough for one person. The serving was so moist and I'm not typically a fan of grits. I would definitely order this again. For main dishes, I ordered the tenderbelly pork chop and my fiance ordered the signature short ribs. I loved the grill marks on the pork chop yet it still is so tender upon cutting into it. The meat was full of flavor and the presentation was above and beyond. Both servings were excellent portions and without lack in quality, considering we were the last party served for the night. For dessert, per the waitress's request, we ordered the bacon s'mores. I love s'mores and I love bacon but this was my first time trying a combination and it didn't disappoint. It was sweet yet salty at the same time. The bacon was mostly a subtle taste but still met our expectations. I love supporting local businesses and I'm so happy that we never once felt rushed, and were treated the same as if we had walked in at any other hour.",

I so excited to come back to this place after 4 years or so, and was completely disappointed. The food was just okay, and for the cost not really worth what you pay. The biscuits were cold and dry, the chicken was bland and dry, and the short ribs were not very tender. I would say the only good dish at the table were the scallops. Our server was very nice though, so that's definitely a positive. I think all 10 of us dining were very underwhelmed and disappointed with the food.",

I'm Celiac and need to do gluten-free and we were pleasantly surprised to see lots of options. We started with the deviled eggs that change weekly. The shrimp and grits were awesome and had great flavor. For dinner I had the osso bucco. It was amazing!! My wife had the pork chop which was also gluten free. It was very good and not over cooked (I find pork chops to be easily over cooked). This restaurant was a great find that had many gluten free options. We'll be back!",

    "text": "The tagline (and shiny new door handles) that say \"Come Together\" couldn't be more appropriate for Beckett's Table...   Last night was only their fourth night open, and I'm giving them a solid four stars.  The Becketts and partners Scott and Katie Stephens did a remarkable job with the renovations of what used to be \"That's Italiano.\"  The environment is extremely comfortable and warm.  The staff was spot-on, starting with the hostesses.  And throughout our meal, Court, our server, made plenty of recommendations and answered all of our questions about the menu.  We happened to see a handful of friendly faces and friends dining while we were there as well.     We started off with the mac n cheese with pancetta and the oven roasted organic root vegetables (both a bargain at 5 dollars each).  Next up was the romaine salad and brussel sprouts, which are not to be missed.  The pickled golden beets in the romaine salad were unique and delicious, as were the hot appetizers and sides.  When I couldn't place one of the vegetables, Court was right there with the answer for me: parsnips!  We paired our first course with the Pilsbury \"One Night Stand\" rose and liked it so much, we had another round.  For our entrees, I had the blood orange glazed salmon and J went with the fork tender short ribs.  Both were large servings, especially the short ribs, and the description for these is perfect; no knife needed.  I actually liked the short ribs so much, that i ate more of that than I did the salmon, which had a bit too much orange glaze for me.    As if that weren't enough food, we finished up with an order of the fig & pecan pie...it is served with a cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream, the perfect sweet ending to our meal.  The only suggestion that Jared had for this course, was to also offer a Root Beer Float.  Perhaps we'll see that on the menu in the future?!  One funny thing about the evening was that they were out of the \"pate all the time,\" which was ok, as we can try it next time!  We will definitely be back to Beckett's Table soon - I see it being a regular in our rotation of neighborhood spots for sure!",

The butter lettuce salad I started with was yummy and light.  Super comfy, cozy, friendly place.    I will say, if you go for an early dinner you are somewhat competing with business traffic in that strip.  Not unmanageable, just a bit messy.",

My favorite dish is the Short Ribs which have always been fantastic, but the last time I ordered they were very fatty and I was a little disappointed. Other items I've ordered..  Grilled Cheese & Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Soup - OUTSTANDING, one of my favorite things on the menu and one of the best grilled cheese/soup combos out there.  Macaroni & Cheese - flavor was good, but could've used a bit more cheese Pork Osso Buco Confit - fall of the bone pork with so much flavor  They always have specials and it is a great place to spend for holidays (we like going for Mother's Day/Father's Day). They also have 1/2 priced Arizona wines on Sundays, which is a huge perk!  I love the atmosphere and decor. The sliding glass doors leading out to the patio are a great addition and the patio is always a great place to sit if not too warm out.   Will definitely come back as there are so many more things on the menu that I would like to try.",

    "text": "Came to Beckett's Table upon some recommendations from locals for my weekend visit and although we enjoyed our experience, the meal wasn't much to rave about. The ambiance and service is fantastic but the food left something to be desired.  We came close to 9 p.m. on a Saturday night and were seated pretty quickly. The booth was amazing. It was like eating on my home sofa. Incredibly comfortable and intimate. Pam our server came to greet us and chatted us up a bit. She was incredibly helpful when it came to questions on the menu and recommendations.  We opted for the cheese bread, brussel sprouts, shrimp and grits and osso bucco.  Cheese bread - served with apple butter. While good, I've had better apple butter. I suppose I like my apple butter more buttery, less apple-y. This apple butter was more like an apple sauce. Brussel Sprouts - winner of the night! I could have eaten 3 orders myself. Shrimp and grits - a bit too salty for my liking. But good. Plentiful shrimp, wished there was more andouille sausage. Grits were great! Osso Bucco - not too special. Spaetzle was a bit bland and the pork was off. We couldn't pinpoint what it was, but we've had plenty better. Fig & Pecan pie - This was tied for the winner of the night. Served with cream cheese citrus ice cream, it was amazing with my cup of coffee. I really enjoyed this dessert and would recommend it to everyone who dines here. The texture of the cream cheese ice cream and the crust of the pie and the fig and the pecan really paired well together.",

The restaurant is so pretty on the inside and I love that they have a patio. We were seated promptly and our waitress was very accommodating and nice! She explained some favorite items on the menu and I ordered the beef short rib. My friend had the burger and we both shared the mac n cheese. My father also ordered the short rib and the grilled cheese appetizer. The grilled cheese was so delicious! I could eat that all day! The bread is so soft and the cheeses are so amazing. The tomato bisque on the side was delicious too. The mac n cheese was just ok. I did like that they put mustard seed to give it a kick but it was way too much. We ordered ours with prosciutto  but there was hardly any on there. The Short Rib was AMAZING!! Everything about that plate was perfection! The meat was so tender, you didn't need a knife, it just kind of fell off your fork!  The mash potatoes were seasoned perfectly and the veggies were cooked delightfully. I read that the portions were small but it was more than enough! My father actually finished my plate! I did steal a bite from my friend'ss burger and it was so juicy and flavorful, I wanted more! For dessert we shared the pecan and fig pie with the cream cheese ice cream! The ice cream is so freaking good! I could have a whole gallon of it! What a wonderful experience, I cannot wait to come back!",

I have celiac disease (essentially an extreme gluten allergy) and the waiter not only assured me he would communicate this to the chef, but also made sure to warn me that my husband's meal was dusted with flour and cautioned against sneaking a bite. Talk about going the extra mile!   The only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars is that I asked for my food to be boxed up when my plate was taken, and the busboy forgot about it. When I asked again, he brought out a bagged box of leftovers, and when I opened it at home, found someone else's food in it (my husband cleared his plate, so it couldn't have been his). So I paid for half of my meal to be thrown away. It was delicious too, so I was bummed to see I was sent home with the wrong leftovers. Otherwise, great place for dinner!",

Since we were seated by the kitchen, we could hear and smell all of the delicious-ness that was going on back there.  Our food was brought out pretty timely for how busy the restaurant became.

We noticed several non-meater options on the menu and decided to give this place a whirl, considering it is essentially a famous Phx restaurant.  We made reservations and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. But we were seated all the way in the back, with 2 other tables. Thing is, my wife wound up staring at the wall behind my head because our 2 top was situated so that only 1 of us could observe the dining area.  And the noise! good lawd. the ceiling was lower where we were sitting and the acoustics were absolutely horrid. we spent the first 10 minutes yelling at each other so we could hear, and then decided to eat as quickly as possible and in silence since we couldn't hear each other anyway. i was getting a headache from the noise and agitated at this place. Service was fine...non-memorable. He didn't engage us at all...probably because it was so freaking loud.  I ordered the mushroom and endive salad which was delicious. The main course, Sea Bass, was fine. The fish itself was nothing spectacular...the garnish was more of the flavor experience. Dessert was fine....melted ice cream and it's darn hard to eat melting ice cream with a fork. even restaurant week prices steep for the below average experience.",

For dinner we had the special pork belly which my brother enjoyed and said he wanted to go hug the chef thank you.  I had the shrimp and grits which were awesome.  I've never had a tomato based sauce on that before and it was perfect.  Dessert is a must here.  Fig pecan pie tasted like delicious fresh figs with the crunch from the pecans.  Perfect!  Last thing - the cocktails.  So inventive and oh so good.  The fig orange Manhattan was the special and was gone in 3 minutes it was so good.  I had the Pimm's cup which I also really enjoyed.

I'm from the south and really, sometimes I would just like a southern place that does justice to what we ate most of the time--freshly picked field peas and a side of buttermilk cornbread with some serious raw fixin's on the side like green onions right out of the garden, freshly picked tomatoes and cucumbers and some home-canned jalapeno peppers (and once in awhile a side of fried okra). None of those were cream, butter and meat-laden and they were still awesome and yummy!",

    "text": "So many reasons this insanely amazing restaurant holds my spot as number #1 restaurant. Bethany was our waitress, so upbeat, knowledgeable and attentive. Her knowledge of wine really blew my away, and how to pair it with all the different entrees was so helpful. Next Enrique, he out did himself! So friendly and equally knowledgeable. Never once did out water glasses even go half empty and always offering his help in any way. He talked about his favorites and different sides to add on. I could go to this restaurant every night of my life and never get sick of it... but this night I brought my mom for her 65th birthday and I have to tell you... it's was my favorite and most memorable!! The food was spot on, hats off to the talented chefs! Plus to have my favorite Cabernet Silver Oak by the glass... yes please!!! Cheers Becketts Table, you yet again hit a home run!",

A veggie tower with balsamic reduction appeared! Yes, the same veggie tower is now on the menu! I would love to see more non meat items, but for quality, atmosphere, and price for a local neighborhood establishment, Beckett's Table is a fabulous experience.",

Although they missed our reservation time by about 15 minutes (not a big deal to us), they apologized profusely and dessert was on the house. Our waiter, John, was excellent at his job. He was helpful, unobtrusive and attentive to our needs. Although we had a water pitcher on the table to pour our own, my glass never got empty, someone always came and refilled it for me. I had the cast iron chicken which was awesome and I would highly recommend it! My husband had the osso bucco which was also well seasoned and delicious. (Although I think he preferred my chicken) We had the smores for dessert which was more hype than flavor for me. Chocolate covered bacon was an interesting concept... but really didn't make me want to lick the plate (although the peanut butter sauce it came with sure did). I can't be too upset though, it was free... I wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend it to someone else.",

The waiters and one of the women owners we talked with were friendly, helpful and only the person at the front entrance was a little stand-offish(maybe because we didn't make a reservation and were casually dressed? or older? who knows?).  The food was the AZ Restaurant Week Special and good for the most part, but not quite that special.... could have used more herbs, spices, etc. Presentation was beautiful, tho. The chocolate mousse desert was the best and that was because it was not too sweet but very chocolate-y!  Could have used some nuts sprinkled on the top with maybe a berry or some such fruit.....just to add a little crunch and specialness to it however.",

Beckett's table had good reviews, the menu looked promising online, and I am gluten free and they label their gluten free options on their menu....bonus for me!   We started with their brussel sprouts.  Delicious and this could get me to eat more veggies! I was with a friend and my spouse, and we all loved every bite.  Friend had chicken, I had a burger, on a gluten free roll, and my husband had pork, with baked beans.  I also had a kale salad, which I could live on for the rest of my life, it was fantastic.  Lastly, brown butter icecream (don't be scared, it tastes like carmel). and coffee creme brule.  Wanted to try the smores, but the graham cracker was not gluten free...I would have given you 6 stars if you could make that happen:)  Finally our waiter could not be better.  I would give him 5 stars as well.  His name was Brandon,  he was super knowledgeable about the menu, was very patient with us  as we had alot of questions.  We never felt rushed and his timing was impeccable with being around just when we needed something.  The only draw back about this place, its in Phoenix and I live in Chicago! Open a Beckett's here please.",

The first tikme i ordered the green chile pork stew - the flavor was good but after a few bites I was bored with the same flavor with each bite.  This last time - Saturday, Spetember 1st  - I ordered the Steamed fish....I get that this is mainly a comfort food restaurant using a ton of bacon and sausage in their food - but I was in the mood for something light and semi-healthy.  i feel like this was their forgotten dish - the fish had zero flavor and the color on the plate was white and light orange from the butternut squash puree.  Very bland.  i was very disappointed.  I won't go back unless I am ready to eat a heavy and fatty meal.  Upside is the service was good and my boyfriend liked his roasted chicken.",

My husband ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits with candied jalapeno butter as an appetizer and claimed that they were the absolute best biscuits he had ever had. Our friends split the chicken meatballs with roasted red peppers and bread crumbs and the portion was both very generous and tasty. My friend and I each had the Scottish salmon which was a nice thick piece unlike the stingy, thin slices most places serve. The two men had the \"signature\" fork tender short ribs with mashed potatoes. The ribs literally could be eaten with just a fork they were so tender and delicious. Usually we forgo desert but we were intrigued by home made fig and pecan pie with cream cheese citrus zest ice cream .  Definitely one of the best deserts we have ever had. All in all a great dining experience!  We'll be back!",

We had the cheddar biscuits which I had been craving all day. My husband and I both found them to be dry and lacking in flavor. My husband had the green chili pork stew (or something of the sort) which the waitress described as being smokey vs spicy. He said it was good, but definitely spicy. I had the short rib because of the amazing reviews. It was good. Not great. Nothing really exciting about it. We also started with the grits which were delicious and I ordered a side of the stuffing because I'm a sucker for it and that was also delicious. Those two things were probably the best part of the whole meal. Would we go back again? Yes, if we were meeting other people or something, but it probably won't make our list again for date night.",

The mashed potatoes were decadently rich and tender.  And I couldn't stop eating the hearty and flavorful bacon biscuits.  I had the sea bass with veggies and was totally impressed that all veggies were cooked to perfectly crisp tender and were well seasoned.   They have a different fish dish each night which provides even more incentive to eat here on a more regular basis.  The roast chicken was simple, tender, and delicious.  In fact everything I ate had well balanced flavors and was perfectly seasoned and salted.  I thought the creamsicle creme brulee was a creative spin on a tired staple at most restaurants.  The brown butter and vanilla ice creams had clean, delicious flavors.  Service was very attentive, friendly, and professional.  I loved the large open dining area with high rustic ceilings, and was surprised that the noise level wasn't that loud considering the number of conversations going on at once.  I really appreciated all the little details throughout the meal like the napkin rings, making sure water glasses were never empty, and providing new/clean silverware as appropriate for the course.  I'm not an alcohol drinker but I noticed that they have a huge wine and other alcoholic beverages list.  In all this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while with well executed food and service and an attention to detail that shows how much the chef and everyone working here cares about putting out excellent food.",

    "text": "Traditional American comfort food done right! After my second visit Beckett's Table is quickly becoming one of my favorite Phoenix places to dine. The restaurant has a high-end feel to it but the prices are very reasonable. At first glance one might not think the menu is very adventurous but you would be missing the point. What Beckett's Table does is something we should all do which is: do your very best version of whatever it is you are doing. In this case it means not shocking everyone with exotic ingredients or wild ideas. Having amazing mashed potatoes and stuffing is almost always better than some alchemist chef experimenting on you. There is a reason we all love simple comfort food like popcorn and macaroni and cheese. The reason is that we know it will be good. If someone said \"hey have you tried my new chili pepper and sardine flavor mac?\", you might be curious but it is hardly anything you sit around hungry for. There is a quaint theme to many of the menu items which is the inclusion of bacon on nearly everything. Worry not though vegetarians Beckett's will not leave you hungry. My veggie wife was able to get the grilled cheese and tomato soup bacon-free with no fuss. The staff is very friendly and the ability to place a reservation through the Yelp ap in between Call of Duty matches was a big help.",

I am open to all kinds of food however, my husband is a big burly football kind of guy and likes meat and potatoes.  They were able to satisfy each of our tastes and believe me my husband will make it known to me if it's \"rabbit food\".  I have to say that what stood out most was our waitress.  I really felt like it was surreal.  She was so passionate about what they had to offer and her eloquent delivery of every morsel.  The way she was so passionate and knowledgeable about the food, herbs and freshness I felt like my mind had swirled off into la-la land and I was thinking of guys that I thought she would be a perfect match for.  I had to bring myself back down to ground and order my food.  I must say she was the topic of mine and our friends discussion for the next few minutes.  As we left we were given a very friendly exit conversation with what must have been the owner or manager.  He wanted to make sure we had a wonderful experience and we did.   Like I said before I have grown up in the area and seen restaurants come and go.  When I saw Beckett's Table go in I gave it a few months.  I would drive by and see it busy, even on the weeknights.  A year later I gave it a try and I now know why it has survived.  It's a great place with great food.  Take your out of town guests there for a wonderful meal.",

Immediately noticed that the kitchen staff were having a good time, and seemed to enjoy their jobs - which is good for the food.  :)  Our waiter greeted us immediately and got water going for us right away, and explained the special... Some salmon thing that sounded magnificent.  Seeing the plates coming out of the kitchen, I was afraid we would both leave a little hungry.  The menu isn't overly extensive, but it definitely was a hard decision.  I ordered the cast iron chicken, and my gf got the chicken and dumplings soup.  Both entrees were the perfect size and WOW the flavors were just amazing.  Everything in each dish just \"worked\" together.  It was nothing short of fantastic!  The portion was just right...  though if you're accustomed to eating a much larger meal, you might want to add an appetizer or an extra side or something - no harm there.  The prices were a little more than I would have cared to pay, but the taste and quality of the food made me feel like I got my $$ worth.   The atmosphere of the place was great too...  Our waiter was very attentive, as were the others we saw running around by the kitchen.  The second our waters approached the bottom of the glass, someone was there to top it off.  They also have some really neat specialty cocktails...  We ordered one to share just for the fun (they're a little spendy too) but I was VERY impressed with it.  It had pomegranate in it, and usually those drinks are overwhelming, but this one was just perfectly balanced.  Top notch!  If they were a couple bucks cheaper, I could have easily downed a few more.    Overall, terrific smells, service, taste, presentation, perfect portion (for us, anyways), and a great atmosphere!    Just don't try going on a Monday...  We tried, and found out they are closed on Mondays.  I'm so glad we went back another day, and can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes.  This place turned out to be quite the gem!",

I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DISH WTF?!? Anyway, after I had a few moments to quietly rage in my head and settle for some of the other selections, I was hoping that maybe the sugar pumpkin side dish I ordered would make me forget all about the pork if been lusting after...Sadly, the pumpkin dish was bland and more sour than 'sugary'... And the kale salad lacked flavor. It looked like they threw 6 leaves of kale on the plate with a drizzle of pomegranate seeds and some vinegar. BRING THE chili PORK stew BACK OR IM NEVER RETURNING.",

We happened to walk in with out a reservation and they were able to sit us right away which was amazing and I was getting a really good vibe from the place. Anyways \"long story short\" our designated server was never really there for us. It was the hostess and the manager filling our drinks when needed to be filled. Plus they had someone else bring us our food as well. Our waitress only showed up to take our orders and to give us our bill. Besides she gave my sister a nasty stare for wanting to order off the kids menu from not being so hungry. I leave this poor review for that reason.  I also think the price range for the food is a bit high for the amount they serve. But still food was amazing.  all in all, the bitch of a waitress received only a penny as a tip from me! I don't think I'll ever go back unless they offer me a discount.",

Great wine and cocktail selections (Check the old copies of Wine Spectator on the table near the restroom, and see that BT ranks with the best of the country's best...Wine Spectator does NOT give compliments easily).  Small menu, but exceptionally creative and flawlessly executed, always.  An environment of not just intelligence and cultivation and hipness, but warmth and comfort too.  Perfect, joyfilled, enthusiastic service.  If you don't like BT, I would love to know what day/time you went, because I've been there on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights, and it's always one of the finest dining experiences I've had in Phoenix.

First impression-I wish it was in a better part of town and it appears they are going for the whole Chelsea's Kitchen vibe with ambiance.    Their food doesn't even compare to CK however.   Our server was Cort and he was nice enough. Didn't wow me but servers don't need to as long as they are nice.    He recommended for apps the cheddar bacon biscuits and the bacon Mac n' cheese.  The biscuits were dry and just ok.  The Mac n' cheese was meh.  My husband ordered the chicken which in the center had cold spots.  We told our server who took it back to the kitchen and a new one was prepared.  When the manager brought it out she remarked \"do want to see if it's hot enough for you now?\". We all thought that was rude.  People don't go to restaurants and hope for their food to be cold!  I had the fork tender short ribs.  They were good but just average.    My friend had the pork chop which was also good and her husband the pork stew which he described as \"hearty but not fantastic.\"  We will not be making a repeat visit.  The food was mediocre and in fact is still sitting in my stomach like a rock.",

    "text": "My husband and I were in Phoenix for a trade show recently and I Yelped restaurants in the area looking for Gluten-Free dishes.  Having lived in Phoenix for a nanosecond many years ago, I was not expecting a whole lot.... Much like Vegas, Phoenix has long had a fondness for bad decor Italian restaurants with unimaginative food and chain restaurants. However, the reviews for Beckett's Table were great so I figured it was worth a try.  WOW... I was beyond pleasantly surprised.  I will go as far as to say it was one of the best meals I have ever had, hands down.  That's saying a lot!  As I told the waiter, Beckett's Table would give any restaurant of its kind in NYC a run for its money.  I had the vegetable chopped salad which tasted like the tomatoes and other vegetables were just picked, the roasted PEI mussels (yummy!) and last but not least... the chocolate-dipped bacon s'mores.  My taste buds were in heaven.  Perfection.  My husband's meal was also fantastic. Everything tasted so fresh and well-made.  You really don't get better than this.  The night we went was a Wednesday and it was packed.  I would imagine that is the case most nights... however, don't let that deter you from making a reservation. Truly a gem... Perfection in every way.  Next time I'm in town, it will be the first and last place we go!  Hey guys... if you ever want to open another restaurant, do it in Westport, CT!!",

    "text": "Stopped into this comfy spot on a Sunday night at 6:30pm for a birthday dinner with about 15 other people.  We had a reservation and were immediately sat.  The restaurant was about 90% full and i didn't see a wait.  Atmosphere is very simple and comfortable, I could see myself stopping in here in just a t-shirt, jeans and sneakers, or on a romantic date in a cute outfit and heels.  I love versatile places like this.  The bar is on the smaller side, but looked pretty inviting.  There is a gorgeous community table in between the bar and the dining area that I would LOVE to take home with me.  Now onto the actual amazing experience...  I had actually arrived a little late, but even so, the server (didn't catch her name, she was a cute lady with short light brown hair) was quick to address us formally and grab us a drink order.  After catching up with everyone, our order was very politely taken without yelling over anyone's conversation or interrupting our pointless chit chat.  Even though they were out of what my significant other wanted originally, he was very politely directed towards another entree in which he absolutely loved.  I think he would have licked the plate if no one was looking.  I had the bass which was full of a variety of balanced flavors and textures that accompanied the bass very well.  All I heard from the rest of my party were rave reviews after the first few bites.  During dinner, service did not waver in greatness either.  Waters were consistently filled and maintained.  Used dishes and glassware were immediately taken when no longer needed.  I believe each and every one of us were personally asked how our entrees were which was a very nice personal touch.  The bill was politely dropped as well and I think 5 different people gave us their thanks and good byes before we left.  One of the floor managers was up front by the door and held it opened and asked how our dinner was before we left as well.  All in all I had absolutely no complaints and will be visiting again very soon.  Thank you Beckett's Table for the refreshing service and delicious dinner!",

The employees were great, friendly, and knowledgeable.   The food... not so much. We started off with the chicken meat balls. Had no taste, and had way too much of some herb. I had the petite chicken as my dinner. This dish as well, had no taste. It was nothing special. For $16.00, I hoped it would have been amazing. Will not be back. This place is just too expensive for the lack of taste it offers.  On a side note.. if you bring in your own birthday cake... they charge you $1.00 per slice. WHAT!! Yes boys and girls...

On the other hand, I feel the food is hit or miss...it's not as consistent as one would hope.  I get it, when food is made fresh on the regular, stuff is going to be a little different here and there.  The service has always been great, nice people and informative when I've had questions about the menu.  We usually get the roasted beet appetizer which comes with goat cheese and (I think) walnuts.  Yum!  I've had a fish, beef and chicken entree here..can't say that I enjoyed the fish but the beef and chicken were tasty.  The fig and pecan pie is really outstanding.  I was a little put off when I first read it, because I'm neither a fig nor pecan fan.  But let me tell you, paired with their cream cheese and citrus ice cream that pie is amazeballs.  They have fun house cocktails and a large community table made out of a big piece of beautiful wood.  We came here for my gf's graduation dinner and they were nice and accommodating, although when I let our server know right up front that we were going to need separate checks (already checked to make sure when we called for the reservation and they said it was fine) he gave a little 'tude at first.  I had to explain that I, too, am a server and I know how it is doing split checks (actually it's really not that big of a deal if people tell you up front)...he relaxed after a bit.    Anyway, I still feel lurv for this place and I will continue to come back and try different cocktails/wine/food.",

    "text": "I met Chef Justin Beckett several months ago when he was the Guest Chef at Petite Maison in Scottsdale for their Late night 'Staff Meal.' Beckett had an energy and deft touch with his cuisine that told me big things were coming for him and the Phoenix culinary community. I began following Beckett's Table on Twitter and saw that Beckett embraced the use of social media to really reach out and connect with anyone who loved food.  I have had the privilege of watching Beckett's table transform from an empty restaurant that went the way of the white buffalo, to the open and inviting space that it has become (more on that in a future post).  On opening night, as I knew I would, I stepped throughout the door of Beckett's dream and into the first meal of my 52 week dining adventure. First up, a cocktail, in my case the 'Paimaire,' consisting of Kettle One Oranj vodka, pomegranate liquor and juice, lemonade 'and a little love.'   This cocktail, like everything on the menu, has a story and special meaning. Beckett tells the story of buying his house from a couple who would become partners in Beckett's table. If the cocktail is any indication of the coming meal, I'm in for a treat.  One of the menu items that immediately caught my eye and whet my appetite was the creamy grits with two kinds of locally made (Schreiner's) spicy andouille sausage ($8) surrounded by a rich, slightly piquant mustard jus.  The grits were a little tighter than I normally like but creamy and with the gritty bite from which they take their name. A spoonful with a little jus, caramelized red onion and bite of plump juicy sausage rolls my eyes back into my head and tells me that Chef Beckett means business.  Of course, one appetizer just wouldn't do and Beckett's Original grilled cheese with four cheeses, pancetta and roasted red pepper tomato soup ($9) is next up.  Buttery sweet brioche and a well balanced mix of cheeses complimented by a vibrant, dense tomato soup that clings to the bread rather than dripping combine to delight. Delicate flavors wash over the palate and something becomes clear, this meal is beyond average.  On to the main course (who am I kidding, main courses!). That's right, two mains made their way to my table, first to go under the fork was a Beef Bourguignon shepherd's pie ($16) with a deep, rich gravy, carrots, parsnips and herbs topped with a raft of light and fluffy mashed potatoes.  Succulent chunks of savory beef nearly melted in my mouth vying with perfectly cooked vegetables for dominance of every available taste bud. Sitting in the restaurant with the front open to the elements, I long for a cold and dreary day for this dish to brighten.  It is a very rare meal which a pork product cannot improve and so it was with great anticipation that I moved the plate of Local Pork Osso Buco ($18) to center stage.  Flanked by moist, slightly chewy butternut squash spaetzle on one side and roasted vegetables including brussels sprouts (yup, I ate em), parsnips that were creamy and sweet on the inside as good roasted root veggies should be, carrot and golden beets (which I had eaten for the first time recently), on the other side, the pork shank confit was simply impressive. Kissed by a black pepper reduction, the meat was absolutely tender and moist, pulling easily away from the bone.  If there were any criticisms of this dish, it would be that I wanted some sort of sauce for the spaetzle as I found it tasty but a little bit lonely. I would have loved for the black pepper reduction to be a bit thicker and for there to have been a bit more as it paired so well with the pork and I would have really loved for there to have been room for dessert (though I'm pretty sure Chef Beckett had little control of that detail)  In all, Beckett's table will take it's rightful place among the most well regarded restaurants in Greater Phoenix and become a must visit destination for fooderati. (if I made that word up, feel free to quote). Stay tuned for next week's meal and a photographic journey of Beckett's Table from hollow shell to culinary hot spot.",

Now, we went one of their first days last year for our anniversary and once our waitress found that out, we were treated wonderfully. We were given glasses of champagne on the house... how thoughtful! We ordered the grilled cheese as a starter, and it was good. A grilled cheese is a grilled cheese, but it was good... I loved the bacon inside and the soup it came with was smokey and delicious. For entrees I had the short rib and the BF had the shepherd's pie. The short rib was very good... fell apart and had a nice flavor. The mashed potatoes and green beans that came with it were also delicious. The BF's shepherd's pie was also delicious, but it came out on the cool side... BUT when our waitress was informed, she handled the situation perfectly. She apologized and replaced the meal quickly with a new one. The new one was perfect AND the size was much larger than the first time we went to this restaurant. We ordered the pecan fig pie for dessert and it was much better than the last time we had it. The pie had a nice consistency and the ice cream was very good. In addition, they brought us a piece of chocolate birthday cake that was rich and delicious. Needless to say, I was ridiculously stuffed. When we got our bill, we were informed that they comped our pie for our anniversary. So our bill was 18$. For real. They had entrees for 1$, comped champagne, comped pie, comped cake.... This was the best deal for a wonderful meal. The service, as always, was spot on, and I like that they really made us feel special for our anniversary. Thanks Beckett's Table for a memorable night!",

At Becketts, the food was fantastic, the service was perfect, but I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think there is anything really unique about the experience. I will say, the restaurant is charming, with walls that open, a nice patio and an open kitchen. Our server was great, and had a casual, friendly approach that made it feel like we had known him for years. This restaurant has a warm, comfortable vibe that makes it feels like you are eating at your parents home, if your mom was a really amazing cook.  Details: Three people at our table of six ordered the chicken, at the servers recommendation. I normally wouldn't order chicken at a restaurant, but the server sold it, and it did not disappoint! We also had the grilled cheese with tomato soup (yum) and mushroom enchiladas. Everyone enjoyed everything we ordered, and we did not save room for dessert. The only complaint from our table was the limited beer selection. The wine selection was not huge, but satisfactory.",

The problem is the food.  Everything else was perfect and the service was excellent but I'm sorry to say, this is some of the blandest food I've ever had.    There were four of us at dinner and nobody liked their food.  Every dish was OK (as in edible) but nothing was particularly good. Every dish was under-seasoned and under-salted. Every single dish, from the bread to the dessert.   A few specifics:  Chopped Salad - As someone else commented, it looked like a child threw some things on a plate. That's spot on.  And peanut brittle?  Just say no to that idea please.  Osso Buco Confit -  Dry  and completely devoid of flavor, and a rather small portion on top of it.   Accompanied by a tablespoon of (once again) under-salted spaetzle.     Bread - Again, bland  - There were four of us and we didn't finish our small bread basket.  Everybody tried it and the reaction was, \"ehh.\"  Fruit Cobbler - A ramekin of fruit in syrup with ice cream is not a \"cobbler.\"  A cobbler implies either a pastry or biscuit topping.  There was none.  Very, very disappointing.  Pecan Pie.  A very poor execution of this American classic. Again, completely devoid of flavor.  The drinks were quite good and the service was excellent and friendly to a fault.  I love the idea of this place and I love the menu, but the food just did not deliver.",

    "text": "Not much add that the other reviewers haven't touched on.  I went in tonight with Kim T. to talk about the upcoming Great Cajun Cookoff and Food Fest.  Knowing the Southern influence of the menu, we figured it would be appropriate to have a drink and an appetizer while pouring over the details. Ambience - Love this room!  Open but not loud, very communal and comfortable.  The devil is in the details - and BT didn't miss a step anywhere! Service -  Was flawless - thank you, Court!  This man knows the food and was great with suggestions! Drink - Kim and I each had a Miss Katie's Pimm's Cup.  While I love ginger and cucumber together, I rarely order a Pimm's Cup, as I am not a fan of gin.  Miss Katie's is made with vodka - problem solved!  The only issue with this cocktail is that it goes down WAY too easy.  This drink could get me into a whole lotta trouble!  (Bring it on!!)  I asked Miss Katie if they carried Abita Beer (one of our favorites, from southern Louisiana).  She wasn't sure off the top of her head if they had it in or not, but was going to check.  She came back a few minutes later with a bottle of Abita Amber and 2 frosty pint glasses - poured the bottle into the glasses for us to split and offered it to us, gratis!  Now - THAT is beyond service!  I've been to restaurants that offered an amuse bouche - but never one with an amuse beer! :)  Food - Looking at the menu, we decided not to split an appetizer.  Instead, we'd split an appetizer, a side and a dessert!   The bread basket came with 2 fresh rolls with cheese, and one dark wheat roll - side of honey butter.  While they were fresh and hot and tasty, I really can't comment on the butter, as we never touched it - or the bread on its own, as we used it to soak up the mustard jus from the grits and sausage appetizer.... I heard great things about the grits and andouille sausage  appetizer - but was not expecting this level of amazing flavor.  I've never really liked grits and couldn't understand why people did.  Now I do!  Turns out, I'd never had them made well.  As Kim put it, they should be so rich you can hardly eat them.  (And they were!)  Not just andouille sausuage, either - there was also hot Italian sausage and a southwest chicken sausage - all from Schreiner's.  (Yay for supporting other local businesses!) While I wasn't completely sold, Kim was stuck on the bacon and cheddar biscuits.  But, what the heck.  I like biscuits, I like cheddar and I love bacon - hard to make a misstep on this one, right?  They're served with an apple butter, which Court strongly urged us to use.  He was right!  WOW!  I think I may start craving these on a very regular basis! For dessert, I could not choose.  Brioche bread pudding is on the menu.  I LOVE bread pudding.  That's one of my all time weakness foods.  The fig and pecan pie sounded really good, as did Death By Chocolate.  I asked Kim to choose...and she made it easy - we should make the meal a pork trifecta and have the BACON S'mores!  (Yes, that's my picture of them..)YOWZA!  Chocolate covered bacon, housemade marshmallow, graham crackers and peanut butter cream.  The dish is so wrong on so many levels that it turns the corner and ends up being very, VERY right!   While it's bad business to suggest skipping an entree - and there are SEVERAL I look forward to trying - the other reviewers comments about large portions are dead on.  Granted, we started late and neither of us were super hungry - but the shared appetizer, side and dessert really was plenty for us and we left feeling full.  Had an entree been involved, there would have been leftovers, or - worse - no dessert!  Amazing place...what a great add for top notch places in the Valley!  Casual enough for everyday meals, but quality and style to impress the out of towners, too!  Beckett's Table - you are my new go-to!",

(peanut butter mousse smeared on a plate with graham crackers, torched marshmallows and chocolate dipped bacon!!! YUM)  highly recommended.  i practically had to roll myself out of beckett's table -full and completely satisfied.",

We started with the Roasted Brussels Sprouts, not something you'd normally think of as a starter--but it was a very interesting starter.  The Brussels Sprouts arrived in a small iron roasting pan.  The shaved cheese and pancetta, along with the vinaigrette made for a unique (and good) taste combination. My wife ordered the wood fired mussels, and she thoroughly enjoyed the entree.  The mussels are prepared with a fennel broth. I had the fork tender short ribs.  The beef came served on a bed of mashed potatoes and they lived up to the fork tender billing.  The sauce on the ribs was not overpowering, but did give some flavor highlights while allowing the beef's flavor to come through. Overall we were very impressed by the dinner.",

We were greeted by the hostess and shown to our table.  Our server came over right away with fresh water and menu's.  So far so good.    Laura ordered the Salmon which was excellent I am very picky with my fish being from Seattle and I would've ate that whole dish.  The Cous Cous was great and a nice salad on the side to tie it all together.    I ordered the Pork Osso Buco Confit which my server said was his favorite.  I see why because this pork was fork tender and just falling apart.  I really enjoyed the dish and the roasted veggies were great.  I didn't even know what half of them were and I was still enjoying them all.    I wish I had room for dessert because they had one I really wanted to try so I will be back for the Chocolate dipped bacon s'mores.    Overall a great dinning experience and it's close to home so that's even better.",

    "text": "Went here last Friday night with my wife, after several recommendations from friends.  For the most part, we were not disappointed.  The ambiance is fine, and the service was friendly.  They had Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout on tap. Already off to a good start.  For appetizers, we had the cheddar-bacon biscuits.  They were very good, and the orange-jalapeno butter that accompanied them was interesting.  The biscuits were as good with and without the butter, but with the butter the flavor profile was much different.  We also had a four cheese and pancetta grilled cheese sandwich. It was heavenly. bread was soft, the cheese was gooey, and the pancetta gave it a delicious saltiness. It comes with a tomato soup that is fine, but sort of overpowers the sandwich.  I recommend eating them separately.  For our entrees, I ordered the meatloaf special and my wife ordered the cast iron skillet chicken.  The cast iron skillet chicken was the biggest disappointment of the night.  It wasn't bad, it was just mostly unremarkable.  The biscuit stuffing that came with it was superb, however.  But oh, the meatloaf.  I'm still thinking about the meatloaf.  I didn't think it was possible to like meatloaf this much.  It's made with beef and veal, and the result is the most tender meatloaf I've ever had.  I would almost describe it as creamy.  If you go here and they have the meatloaf on special, at least one person at the table should get it.  For dessert, we had some of their house made ice cream.  We ordered the milk chocolate ice cream, which was darker than we expected.  We like dark chocolate though, so it turned out great.  The ice cream has an almost pudding-like texture--it seems closer to gelato than traditional ice cream.  It was a great ending to a great meal.  Basically, everything but my wife's entree was fantastic, and even that was certainly fine.  The prices are a bit steep, but they're not at all unreasonable.  We will definitely be going back here.",

    "text": "I first sampled Chef Beckett's food at staff meal at Petite Maison. He had cooked up an amazing grilled cheese with pancetta and tomato bisque. Happily, that's on the menu at his own restaurant, which just opened this last week.  The girlfriend and I decided to try out Beckett's new restaurant tonight and we were simply thrilled. The food included huge portions at fair prices, and it helped that it was delicious. I had the braised short ribs with mashed potatoes and green beans ($19), the girlfriend had the chicken and dumplings ($16). The bread was made in the wood-fired oven and delicious, and the bacon-cheese biscuits ($5) were fantastic. (The bread was so good, I may actually forgo the biscuits next time, sadly!)  Even though it's brand new, the service was absolutely perfect. Our helpful waitress (Tracey) was able to recommend a perfect wine pairing for the girlfriend's meal and was attentive and in a very good mood for being rather close to closing time.  My short ribs were perfectly cooked, full of flavor, and enough to bring home for seconds (factoring in dessert). The girlfriend had plenty of chicken and dumplings leftover and loved her meal, and though she mentioned it was just a bit on the saltier side, she was thrilled to have enough for lunch the next day.  We rounded things out with the chocolate-covered bacon s'mores. That's right. They arrive deconstructed, with each component piece separate on the plate for you to build to your liking. Housemade marshmallow, peanut butter cream, chocolate covered bacon, and graham crackers make for a unique and fun dessert that's just the right amount of food, though it feels utterly indulgent.  The chef and his owner-partner also made sure to greet us and were extremely kind. It's clear they've put a lot of passion into the space and the menu and the food, and it really shows. There are a bunch of things on the menu I'm excited to try--a good thing, as the experience was just fantastic from top to bottom.",

I had the green chile stew which came out burnt on top  and I had to return it. I got the replacement dish and they obviously didn't want to burn it to the point it was under done but tasted all right. I will say that the prices matched up with the quality of food.

Weeks later my Husband is still talking about this place, which is a tad annoying, but surely understandable.  We both decided to get different things so we could experience all that Becket's had to offer.  Highlights included the chopped salad, the green chili (which was somehow kinda sweet) and the fish.

Close to the Clarendon hotel where we were staying... Great search engine, and away we go...  I was able to get a reservation for 715, and the place was packed! The atmosphere was awesome... Huge ceilings... Spacious room, yet it felt quaint, a great buzz, and the hostesses/manager were great. We checked in, they had a table right away for us, and when my daughter wanted to sit outside, they were accommodating and quickly set the table. Our greet was a few minutes behind, but the hostess had already brought crayons, paper, and these great \"eye spy\" things... A great touch. This place is perfect for kids, and parents who love innovative, flavorful, thoughtful food.  The menu read great. My eye quickly went to the pork osso bucco for an entree, and I chose the romaine salad with pickled beets and pancetta. Salad was good.  The beets absolutely made it... If they weren't there, it would have been an ok Caesar...the pancetta was ok, thought it would have been better either as larger pieces of crisp, or lardon style, these were bacon bit size.  The entree was perfect. Super tender pork, spoon tender... The carrots and Brussels were great. I have had some really bad versions of spatzel in my life...this was pretty good, though not really hot.  Overall, the best version of this dish I have had.   (sorry this is so long) service was efficient, and quick after the pause from the greet and water... Although both were apologized for. Server was great with kids, quick with cocktail and wine recommended by the house. Only negatives were no bread offered or served, entree came as salad was still there (although this night it was very ok... By 8, kids were wiped.  Thanks becketts kitchen... We will definitely be back, and will recommend to friends in tucson and phx area!",

I love their drink selection, lots of tasty and fresh combinations as well as local beer selection (yah!) and a great wine list.  The food is hearty and has good flavor.  The grits are great but are more of a sausage dish than grits.  The chef loves his stone ground mustard and it is feature in a lot of the dishes there.  I wish they had more salad options on the menu (only 3) but all of the other dishes I have tried have been very good.  A MUST try is their chocolate covered bacon s'mores dessert, it will change your life.  The service is great but can be a little too attentive.  It is nice to have your water refilled but often the server assistant is refilling it after I have taken a drink, it is ok to let me get  1/2 way through my glass before you jump to refill it.  I also wish they would open a little earlier than 5 PM, if I want an early dinner then I have to look elsewhere unless I want to wait until they unlock the doors for service.",

    "text": "With over 110 reviews ahead of mine, I was reluctant to write my review of this establishment.  However, my meal and the service was so outstanding that I couldn't stop myself.  So, here goes:  Remember how good a fresh tomato tasted when you picked it right off the plant in your garden, and you took that first bite of it?  No?  Then you simply must go here to try it out before the season is over.  It brought back childhood memories I believed were gone forever.  The roasted beets were nothing short of awesome, and if they served them as an entree I would undoubtedly be satiated by this dish alone.  Considering the fact that I usually don't like beets, this is saying something stellar about them...  The zucchini pancakes were good, but they don't hold together well (which worked in my favor when my friends asked for a bite and I couldn't pass it over the table to them).   I'll order them again.  We didn't have desert, as we had other arrangements in advance of our meal here, but we're going back this week to sample those delicacies.  I can hardly wait.",

Try the grits app, and the doughnuts with banana pudding dessert. I was torn about my entree- osso bucco or short ribs? I had the shirt ribs and my only complaint is that I could have used a vat of the red wine reduction. So good!",

    "text": "I want to give my experience with Beckett's Table tonight 5 stars, because I loved so much about it, but it didn't quite live up to \"Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\"  I made 8pm reservations for our table of four, and I'm glad I did, since they seemed to stay steady throughout the evening.  Our waitress was pleasant and helpful from beginning to end.  One note: ask for the bread immediately.  We didn't receive ours until we had been there at least 30 minutes and our entrees were nearly ready - easy to look over, though, because the bread was awesome.  Two from our party ordered the vegetable tower entree, which seemed to please both of them.  I didn't hear rave reviews, but no complaints either.  I ordered the chicken and dumplings and a side order of the mac and cheese to share with the table.  The c&d were DELICIOUS - I finished every bite and was sufficiently filled but not stuffed.  The mac and cheese helped give everyone else something to pick at, which everyone seemed to like.  It wasn't extraordinarily unique mac and cheese, but it hit the spot.  The fourth person at our table had the short ribs, which none of us could get enough of.  I know it was outstanding and I only had two bites of it!  I also appreciated Beckett's wine, beer, and cocktails list.  The beer selection was sizable, which I liked, and the wine list included several from Arizona.  My wife actually had the Grenache blend from AZ - we both liked it a lot and would order it again without hesitation.  All in all, Beckett's made for a great night.  Good location, really cool architecture, friendly service, and excellent food and drink!",

    "text": "Beckett's Table is the best restaurant I have been to this year.  Maybe ever?  Lets start with arrival. Promptly greeted and our table was ready shortly (we made reservations! They are a must!). Waitress was amazing! I wish I remembered her name. SUPER helpful, super knowledgable, and you could tell that she loved food, loved Beckett's, and wanted us all to love it.  As True foodies, we started with a few apps: Grilled cheese sandwich with the soup (very large! lots of food!) was delicious, the special- heirloom tomatoes with tomato clouds (waitress made sure there were 5 clouds, one for each of us) which was super delicious and super playful, and another dish I can't remember.  They have a nice selection of beer- not too large, but good choices. I really enjoyed mine as did everyone else.   I got short ribs. Amazing. So amazing. I seriously dream about these short ribs. I want to drive to Phoenix right now to get some. They were on mashed potatoes that were excellent with some veggies. Friends had excellent food as well, spinach spaetzle was awesome. We also got a side of their bacon cheddar stuffing, which was excellent. Everything I tried this evening was SO delicious.   Dessert, as recommended, we got the smores, but we were so full we had to take them to go. Honestly, not the best choice. The homemade marshmallows were awesome. I'd love to go back and try the dessert in house, although they did package them perfectly to go.   I'll be back as soon as I get the opportunity! If you're considering going, you absolutely must go!",

    "text": "This restaurant proves the theory that good food in Phoenix sells, no matter what the location.    Becketts Table is found in what was previously an Italian restaurant that never had a wait or what appeared to be more than two cars in the parking lot.  Now, as Becketts Table, your lucky to get a reservation on Friday or Saturday and even luckier to go on a weekday and not find a line of people waiting in the rears.  The interior of the restaurant has been completely renovated and it looks great.  Whenever I see an open kitchen, i cant help but think it gives some credibility to the kitchen ethic.  Myself and companion started out with the chicken liver pate and the appetizer special of the night, a pork belly enchilada.  Both appetizers were a real treat and something I would not generally find around my local restaurants here in Arcadia.  For the entrees I had the short ribs and my companion had the chicken and dumplings.  The short ribs were very tasty and by the amount of orders going out of the kitchen, I can tell its a big hit.  The chicken and dumplings were a solid dish, but I think I would have liked a side of rice or some starch to go with it.    Service was right on point, environment was great and the food was extremely solid.  I would recommend this place to anyone and I will be back soon to enjoy it again myself.",

    "text": "This recent addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene is a wonderful experience. The ambiance is a nice balance of stylish and homey. The feel is slightly upscale but completely accessible. It's telling that when we went in, the tables around us included couples out for a romantic night, larger groups of friends, and families out for a nice night.  The food is fantastic without being fussy. Just simple, straightforward and superbly done. We started with the grits & sausage trio which seemed modestly sized at first, but was so rich that it ended up being just right.  I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes, and the ribs were to die for. Rich, moist, and you could cut them with feather. My group also had the pork osso buco with spaetzle. While the ribs were tops, the osso buco was similarly tender and the spaetzle the perfect accompaniment.   They have some great signature drinks. The Legend City Cocktail was light and fresh with a little kick from the bourbon & bitters.  Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable (our orders were based on her recommendations). The staff in general is very congenial, and I could see the owner floating between tables throughout the night.  What topped it for me was that I'd made the reservation for my sister's birthday. After we left, they apparently realized this and so sent me an email apologizing that they didn't realize while we were there, and offered us a free dessert the next time there. They were already on my list of must-return restaurants, but that personal touch and going the extra mile really sealed it for me.",

    "text": "I had been really interested in trying Beckett's after hearing great things about it on Twitter and such.  Then when I heard about the chocolate covered bacon dessert I was totally sold.  So for NYE my girlfriend and I took my parents out to Beckett's and everyone really enjoyed the food and the experience.  The parking situation is bit annoying as the area both in front and on the side of the building is rather small.  Go to the Zipps parking lot next door to find a spot on a busy night.  Upon walking in there is a very warm feeling to the place and that is the main philosophy of chef/owner Justin Beckett, make it feel like home.  I was able to make reservations via the website through OpenTable, that was very convenient.  We were seated promptly and greeted by our server very quickly.    The items on the menu make you think of home cooking, but a little done up.  I started off with the Matzo ball soup, which was done with a chicken broth.  It was good, but I still prefer my mother's recipe.  Everyone at the table got a different dish.  There was the beef bourginion, beef short ribs, chicken dumplings, and the \"B\" burger.  I devoured mine, which was served shepherd's pie style with mashed potatoes on top.  It was really quite delicious.  My mother ate all of her short ribs, which is unusual, and said they were fork tender.  Same for pops with the \"B\" burger.  The girlfriend had the dumplings and I would have to agree that they were a little on the bland side.  Probably the only complaint about the entrees.  For dessert we had the homemade S'mores, which included the chocolate covered bacon, whipped peanut butter, marshmallows, and graham crackers.  The bacon was of course the star of the plate, but the homemade marshmallows were very good.  My parents split the creme brule and enjoyed that as well.  Everyone loved the coffee also.  Overall a great dining experience from start to finish.  I can't wait to go back and try something new.",

    "text": "I loved the simplicity of my first dining experience at Beckett's Table. What looked like copper pipe cut for the napkin rings, small vases with a sprig of mint on each table... definitely no unnecessary frills here! Luckily the surroundings are simplistic because when the dishes are served - look out! Magic, spice and everything nice begins.  We ordered almost everything on the menu (or so it seemed). So when it comes to starting off the meal, I highly recommend sharing the grilled cheese with pancetta & roasted red pepper tomato soup AND the vegetable chop salad with pumpkin seed brittle and a champagne vinaigrette. Although I won't lie - the creamy grits & spicy andouille sausage and mustard came in as a close second. The server mentioned there were three (count them....3!) different types of sausages in the dish. Fantastic and very unique.  Onto the entrees! We tried four but of the ones we picked it was a close tie between the short ribs and the pork osso buco confit. The pork was interesting because it was served with a butternut squash spaetzle, roasted veggies and a black pepper reduction. Quite the combo!  Looking for some serious winter-ish food?? Don't pass up the chicken n dumplings...just like mom used to make (shhh....only waaaaay better!)  I almost forgot about the cocktails! They run a little on the sweet side so I'd recommend a cocktail to start but then stick with wine. We tried almost all of the cocktails but my fave was Miss Katie's Pimms Cup!  Lastly, let's talk about dessert. While the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, caramel, housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter and graham cracker was a novel idea - DO NOT PASS UP THE FIG & PECAN PIE. The fig is mashed into the most amazing crust (and I hate pie crust normally) and served with this cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream that was TO DIE FOR.  The service was fantastic. The ingredients were fresh and the portions were larger than I'd expect for the price. Truly a wonderful addition to Arcadia.",

We started with the cheddar biscuits which were without a doubt the best part of the meal. Our waitress even threw in a 4th one so everyone could have there own.  The salads were good and so were the entrees. I loved my salmon which i would get again the next time I go. The special of the day, which was a southwest lasagna was also very good, as were the enchiladas. the only let down was the chicken and dumplings, which were bland, flavorless and lacking a good amount of chicken. Stay away from them.  Other than that, this place was great. It was packed on a Friday night so be sure to make a reservation.",

They have a small patio and I heard they're planning to build a large patio on the side of the building.   I met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items:   The drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing!   We had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste.   The roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside.   The fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friend's short rib - very tender and lean.   We ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now.   Overall, a great pick!

Whenever in Seattle, I dine at Le Pichet and always sigh afterwards in Phx wishing for a place who would do exactly this.  It's upscale comfort food, I get it.. totally.  Scanning the menu reminded me of a coglameration of the Food Network shows post 9/11 to today (when comfort food took a huge resurrgence and cooking magazine subscriptions peaked after the economy tanked)... the menu is inspiring, all within gourmet reach of making at home but you come here to eat it, because they (most likely) will make it better, present it better, or you just haven't gotten around to attempting it yourself.  And so that was how I ordered, to see how does the kitchen execute the dishes for notes on how I might duplicate the deliciousness at home.  Sitting at the table next to us were young children, and it was really great to see how the staff went out of their way to be extra nice and serve little treats to them at the end of the meal.

We decided on Beckett's because of all the great reviews and a couple personal recommendations. The atmosphere and service was good but food was pretty awful. We had the deviled egg of the day and the bacon stuffing as appetizers. The garlic sauce on the deviled eggs were too overpowering and you forgot you were eating a deviled egg. The bacon stuffing was ok but basically a stove top recipe with stuffing added and was very dry. My pork osso bucco was great and the best thing we ordered next to the water they served. The spaetzle should not have had bacon in it. Not sure why you would add bacon to a pork dish. My husband's burger was awful. Too greasy, too bacony, too cheesey. We concluded the food fest with the \"award winning\" fig/ pecan pie. The cheesecake ice cream tasted like Maalox and pie was just as good as a store bought one. Unfortunately we will not be returning nor did we understand all the hype about this place. I guess in my humble opinion do not over infuse. Not everything needs to have bacon in the mix, sometimes simplicity is best.",

The item that I remember from my first visit that got me to come back was the bacon dipped chocolate s'mores. They are amazing i love the savory sweet combo of the bacon and the homemade marshmallows are fantastic. The peanut butter is also great and doesn't have that super creamy over processed taste that stuff like Skippy has.  To reverse course the meal started with the sausage and grits appetizer which was fantastic. Little bits of sun dried tomato mixed in made this a fantastic dish. The sausage had just the right amount of heat to pair perfectly with grits. The bread that we got was fantastic as well. The honey wheat was my favorite but the jalapeno cheese was really good too.  I also got the zucchini cakes which were phenomenal. I love fried zucchini and fresh and these were the best of both worlds. The flavors that were packed in while still keeping the taste of the zucchini was great. The aoili that it came with was really good as well. Pretty sure it was a cilantro lime but had some other flavors too, I think lemongrass was one I picked up.  The main course was the pork loin with baked beans and coleslaw. Our waiter, who was fantastic, strongly recommend this and I couldn't have been happier taking his suggestion. This was like the fanciest BBQ you could possibly have. It took classic BBQ flavors and paired it with a perfectly cooked chop. I am not a huge coleslaw fan but I ate every bite on this plate. Was a great blend of upscale cuisine and backyard BBQ.   Overall it was a fantastic meal with great service and very good food. Can't wait to come back and try some more. Very happy to have been here and to have Beckett's table be my 100th yelp review.",

    "text": "We finally made it Becketts Table - for Easter supper.  Everything had powerful but appropriate taste and texture [where that makes any sense] from the lemonade all the way through the meal.  The flavor additions to each food enhanced rather than detracted [from] the inherent flavor of the food.   Wife had steamed bass - delicate enhancements; my daughter, the burger - smokey wood flame-broiled - a strong enhancement; the appetizer - briefly-roasted feta cheese had also briefly-roasted purple sage leaves, fire-dried heirloom tomatoes, roasted garlic cloves and peppers with a minimum of capsaicin which all conspired to adroitly enhance the somewhat delicate feta. I had pork osso buco which needed and received next to nothing, and never lifted a knife.  Delicious in my opinion.",

    "text": "I don't know what exactly I can add given the number of reviews here, but here's my take on the food:  Iceberg wedge-I loved that it came with green goddess dressing, but there was maybe a thimbleful of it, and by the time the server came back around, I was nearly finished.  Bacon cheddar biscuits-Bacon and cheddar in a warm biscuit, golden brown on the outside, soft on the inside.  Yes, it was terrible.  One could only imagine the horror I endured.  Fork tender short ribs-More like spoon tender, great flavor with the red wine reduction  and NO fat!  Chocolate-dipped bacon s'mores-Okay I'm in the minority here, but not my favorite.  First, I'm not into the whole deconstructed food idea, but I can kind of see the idea here.  However, I wanted my graham crackers left in bigger squares, so there's more room for assembly.  You can't go wrong with toasty marshmallow, and the whipped peanut butter was an unexpected delight, but I'm not sold on chocolate-covered bacon.  I like bacon in sweets (I even made bacon bourbon brownies once), but I didn't think the chocolate dipped bacon was anything special.  There I said it.  Take a number to stone me.  But please wait until I've gone back to try that fig and pecan pie.  I'm betting that's a winner!",

Of all the great meals we had while in town for the week, Beckett's Table really stood out as the best value for the money.   I had the flatiron steak with duckfat potatoes; SO had the ribs.  Everything was well-presented, flavorful, and top-quality.  Our server, Jared, went out of his way to attend to us - he knew details about the food, was extremely attentive and represented the restaurant well.    When the bill came, I was shocked at how reasonable the bill was - we've paid considerably more for food that wasn't quite to this standard.  I wish we lived here in town to take advantage of this place more often - I can tell you it's on our short list of must-dos when we come back again.",

There are many gluten free and vegetarian options on the menu and always great specials. He makes a mean pan roasted chicken and the ever popular bacon smore dessert.  A MUST!!

Everything was received pretty well, though no one raved about their meal. I think I just picked the wrong thing on the menu.   The highlight of the meal was a side of bacon cheddar biscuits that were really good. I would 100% get those again.   I'd come back, but the menu overall didn't speak to me that much, and I didn't have anything that really wowed me. Service was attentive, they were great with refilling drinks/waters as well.

    "text": "Mmmmmm... mmmmm... mmmmmmm...  That was the sound coming from my husband and I once we got our food at Beckett's Table. Not much conversation after that.  We decided to give BT a try for restaurant week. There weren't too many creative veggie options with the other restaurants and I was intrigued with their dish titled \"veggie noshing board\". And I knew my husband would have plenty of meaty choices.  First of all, the service was impeccable. Upscale but still warm and friendly. And that is how I could describe every aspect of BT. The environment, the food, the concept. Extremely high quality yet you can still wear jeans. I love the vibe. And all their entrees are under $20.  I started out with the potato/leek soup. It was good. Simple but good. The garnish of pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, and roasted cauliflower really made it pop. My husband's starter was a shrimp and black bean dish which he really enjoyed.  My mysterious veggie noshing board ended up being a beet cake with a carrot puree and a medley of veggies with a tomato sauce. I was worried at first. I don't usually like beets and the veggies with tomato sauce looked boring. But the beet cake turned out to be one of the tastiest things I have ever tasted. So delicious. And the flavors of the veggie medley were very good. Clean and tasty. The potatoes in the medley were a little undercooked for my liking, but still very good.   My husband had the pork dish which he was blown away by. He said it was absolutely delicious. The portion size was very generous too. As if he couldn't get enough pork, he also loved the cheddar bacon biscuit it came with.  I had the coconut cake for dessert and my husband had the bacon s'more. Of course, the bacon s'more was a hit with my husband. The coconut cake was good, not too sweet. But I had a hint of a weird aftertaste in the chocolate sauce it comes with. Then I put one and one together when I looked at my husband's chocolate covered bacon. Did they dip the bacon in the same chocolate they used for the coconut cake? Maybe I'm just imagining it but the slightest molecule of bacon can throw a vegetarian off. If they do use the same chocolate I hope they look into changing this... they were so vegetarian friendly in every other way.  They had many other enticing menu items that both my husband and I could enjoy. It was such a pleasant and delicious experience, that we will be back.",

Our party ordered three appetizers, the Mac n cheese, the roasted shezito peppers, and the deep fried deviled eggs, all were spectacular. For diner two in our party each had the house cheese burger which they stated was \"to die for\". I had the Red Rock Cod, which was delicious but wished it had arrived at the table a bit warmer. I will go back in a heartbeat!  I'm glad they accept reservations as the place filled up pretty quick! Glad to see they are doing well.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect here but our entire table left full and happy. Prices are good and portions aren't too small either. You can easily go on a comfortable under $50 date night here which is always a plus in my book.  Boyfriend ordered the pork osso bucco which was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious! While the sweet potato spaetzel side wasn't mind-blowing, the pork was juicy, and fall off the bone tender.My Cast-Iron Chicken dish was also good. Very flavorful chicken (more moist than crisp) with wilted kale and a very good biscuit stuffing. This was tasty (esp. at the good price of $16), but the pork was definitely a better choice. Not pictures: Ben's meatloaf and Corinne's Sea Bass; both of which got thumbs up at the table.   Overall, this was a pleasant place to stop for a casual dinner. Our server Alice was incredible and the atmosphere was intimate but lively. Reservations are definitely recommended as they were quite busy on a Saturday night.",

Do not have the chicken dumpling dish, it's terrible. The salmon and sea bass are just ok, have had better. The pork chile stew is quite decent and flavorful. For desert our strategy was to have a safe bet ( death by chocolate) and be adventurous ( bacon dipped in chocolate smores) . Both were quite decent.

The first thing that I noticed was that the food being offered for restaraunt week was not on the real menu.  This indicated to me that it is food to feed the masses and not the chef's best effort.  But I remained open-minded.  As I said before, the service was fabulous.  The waitress didn't skip a beat!  I was very impressed.  The starters were yummy.  Me and my husband got the salad and zuchinni cakes and split both.  The cakes were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and the salad had the perfect balance of flavors and just a spritz of dressing.  The first course set me up to be very exicted for dinner and then it just wasn't.  I got the white fish.  It was two huge slabs of fish on top of a weird red sauce that had green olives and potatos cooked in it.  On top of the fish was a tiny bit of a white sauce.  It was confusing!  Was I supposed to use the white sauce or the red sauce to flavor the fish.  It wouldn't have mattered either way because both were bland and the fish was the most bland.  I had to salt all of it.  My husband got the shepards pie.  He liked it ok.  Desert was interesting.  The whipped peanut butter was awesome but doesn't really pair well with chocolate covered bacon.  Overall, I think I want to try it again and eat from thier real menu!",

Arriving at just before 7 with 2 friends on a Wednesday, the only available seating according to the hostess was outside, at the bar, at the communal table even though there were several emp0ty 4 tops in the dining room and no one waiting.  We choose the patio which was surprsingly pleasant considering its a few yards away from busy Indian School Rd. After many minutes we were finally greeted by a waiter that we never saw again, Another long interval passes and finally a different waiter informs us he will be serving us now.  We give our drink order and after another 10 minutes I have to flag him down too find out where my drink is and he tells me i didnt order one then says \"oh yeah I forgot\". Finally 35 minutes after being seated I get a drink. We order several apps, salads nd soups to share .  Our observations.  The roasted beets were great, perfectly cooked and seasoned, the salmon was tasty and came with nice condiments the wedge salad was limp and had an odd metallic aftertaste, the gazpacho was delicious, perfectly seasoned and well balanced and the roasted pepper soup was also a hit.  The spatzel was cold, greasy and flavorless.  For dessert we had to try the bacon smores and were routinely disappointed.  The marshmellow was unspreadable, the graham crackers were out of a box and overal it didnt come together.  The fig and pecan pie fared much better with a well balanced filling off set by the cream cheese ice cream. The coffee was terrific.\\  Throughout, the service was, choppy, sporadic and unattentive.  There was no attempt to rectify the situation, apologize, or even acknowledge the problems.  A simple comment saying we apologize for the difficulties, please come back and give us another chance would have left us feeling much better about the whole experience but alas, no comment came.  With the abundace of great restaurants who care about the service they provide and offer a menu consistently creative and high caliber I don't know why anyone would go here.  Restaurants are not doing you a favor serving you and you shouldn't be treated as such.",

The restaurant was incredibly busy...every table filled, yet once seated...we felt like all the attention was on us. Some restaurants can't provide good service on slow days....Beckett's staff has the service part nailed down. Enjoyed Arizona wines, fantastic Osso buco...perfect portion size. Sampled my husbands short ribs....amazing! And they're making their own ice cream now...so that was a scrumptious treat. I, so happy Beckett's Table is going strong....they deserve it. It's food as it was meant to be, in a wonderfully comfortable, industrial style atmoshere.",

After discussing why we wanted to talk with him, the clams were closed, which meant either they were undercooked, or they were bad. Shelfish can kill you if not prepared right. We were then asked to leave the reatuarnat and never come back. Not good!",

    "text": "I would love to give more stars; however our server was a train wreck.  This was our first time eating at Beckett's Table, and we went based on both New Time's reviews as wells as friends' recommendations.  My wife and I shared the chicken meatballs and chopped salad to start.  The meatballs are terrific!  They are moist, well seasoned and the marinara is just flat out awesome.  The chopped salad is, well, boring.  The romain is   cut into ribbons, which makes it difficult to eat.  I'm not one for over-dressing, but I would bet that the there wasn't any dressing on our salad.  My wife ordered the short ribs and I had the cast iron petite chicken.  The short ribs were very well cooked, moist and tender.  However, the only flavor component was salt.  The red wine reduction sauce was overpowering in terms of saltyness.  Overall, there was no depth of flavor.  The chicken on the otherhand, was very well prepared and balanced.  Now for the service, Cort (sp?) was our server.  The only reason we knew that there were specials is because we over heard him tell the table next to us.  After we ate our appetizers, I asked our server what was in the basket on our neighbor's table and his reply was, \"that's our complementary homemade biscuits and rolls, would you like some?\". WTF, I guess you have to ask for the super top secret homemade breads!  Overall, he was very cold and gave us the impression that he wanted us gone as soon as possible.    I think Beckett's Table has the making of a great restaurant.  The restaurant has a great feel.  It appears to be very friendly family.  There are definitely other menu items I would like to try.  My only hope is that the other servers are more personable than Cort.  What's funny is as my wife and I were walking out, no fewer than three employees thanked us for coming in and said good night, more than our server could muster!",

The food was amazing and I wish served as part of the normal menu.  Favorite appetizers is the tomato soup dish.  Favorite desert is the S'mores. So far favorite main has been either the chicken or ribs (not counting the lamb at the special event, it was out of this world).  This place has great cocktails that are reasonably priced and creative.  I recommend the Finn's dilemma.  This is a kid friendly place.  Finally, the servers we have had each of the four times we have been (all different) were great.  Honest about strengths and weaknesses in dishes, insightful, and thoughtful in responding to questions.",

    "text": "We had a very uneven experience.  For every item in the plus column, there was another in the minus column.  Quick example:  Palmaire cocktail was delicious as recommended by server, but the wine on special was Le Cabernet de Paint Thinner.  The front of the house did a good job taking responsibility for the shortcomings, which are almost entirely kitchen issues.  Our party of 6 had a 7 pm reservation, but we weren't sat until 7:30.  This wasn't too much of a hardship because the bar area (and the overall decor) is inviting, so kibbitzing with friends was a good way to pass time.    I sampled almost everything at the table, and we all shared the consensus opinion.  FIRST COURSE:  Matzoh ball soup lacked any real flavor, but had the ball had good texture.    Everything on the pate plate was scrumptious and matched well together (cornichon, manchego, pumpkin brittle, whole sun dried tomatoes, whole grain mustard) but the pate lacked any discernable flavor.  I know some people don't want STRONG pate flavor, but it's got to taste like something or else it's just spamloaf.  Our server  kindly brought extra toast points so the table could share the pate.  Red pepper and tomato soup was good, but not memorably better than what I get at the supermarket.    Roasted brussels sprouts were a success, and we agreed we'd try to make them this way ourselves at home.  ENTREES:  For sides, we ordered the mac and cheese and roasted veggies.  The veggies were a good medley and had a good roast on them, but the mac and cheese came out cold and lacked any cheese flavor.  Just a creamy-tasting bechamel on noodles with pancetta lardon.  Pass.  Beef Bourguinon shepard's pie had a rich, delicious gravy, the beef was very tender, and just the right amount of potato on top.  A winner here, though some felt this entree was quite small.  I just lusted for more beef, since it was really good.  The orange glazed salmon looked beautiful and, according to my friend, tasted \"OK.\"  Our server warned us that some guests found the hot salmon served with cold side items to be off-putting.  My friend decided to try it anyway.  The server was right, but not completely accurate.  The sides weren't cold-- they were frigid.   Cool or room temp would have been much better.  Mussels were a big hit.  The mussels were plentiful, and the wine fennel broth was outstanding.  It got mopped up with the toast to make a solid meal.  The burger, on the other hand, was a big failure.  Here's where our meal fell off the rails.  My wife ordered it medium, and out it came VERY rare.  The server agreed it was wayyy rare, so it got sent back, this time with instructions for medium well doneness.  5 minutes later, out came the second attempt-- but this wasn't much better, medium rare at best.  Back it went for the third try, this time with orders for well done burger.  This time we had to wait 10-15 minutes before my wife's meal came out.  In the interim, they brought her a side salad.  A nice touch, but by now her meal was jacked up beyond any salad's repair.  Finally, out came a lumpy grey burger that was well done alright.  Just not very exciting at all.  The bun was soft and had good texture, but the promise of boursin cheese was not kept.  On a helluva hot burger, the cheese was just a smear of cream cheese that got lost.  Also, all three iterations of the burger were very small. The fries were terrific though.  Small consolation there.  The manager and server were appropriately apologetic for these mistakes.  They comped my wife's entree and offered us a dessert on the house.  We tried to take them up on it.  The server sold us hard on the pecan pie, but when she went to put the order in, she told us they'd just sold out of it.  That was that.    The manager offered us a pair of apps and a dessert on a return trip.  I can't say when or if we'll ever make it back.",

    "text": "So i've been hearing a ton of buzz about this place and finally had time to check it with my girlfriend. This being an old italian place that has been remolded into some lively, warm, and inviting. I do admire beckett for trying to give people valus for money. Using great local food ( ironicly a friend from a local farm happen to notice me there while at dinner) while preparing is simply and comforting. I had for an app the sausage and grits whilemy gf had the grilled cheese and roasted red pepper soup. The sausage was fine and grits could have been more creamy for my taste. The grilled cheese was melted but I thought the soup to be a too sweet (yes I know roasting red bell will increase sweetness) for my taste. Main courses were chicken and dumplings and the osso bucca. The chicken and dumplings were great. Dumplings were light and sauce was nice but I wanted more chicken flavor and the raw celery overpowered the dish. The osso bucca was a different story altogether. The spatzel was good, seasoned nicely and light. The roasted root beg was nicely carmelized. The osso though was tender but lack a sauce. Within five minutes the meat dried out. Not saying bone dry but it wasn't lip smacking like it should have been,  Everyone seems so love this place but i'm not really blown away by it. I understand stand no cutting edge food is here but I really want to be happy after I leave and didn't get that sense after becketts table.",

So much so we brought a party of 7 (out of town family) for dinner for our second visit.  The staff were very good and deserve high marks, as well as the very good tip that was given...........  the food, not so much.  We had the same entree as the first time and it was totally different.  Salad was mediocre at best, Cheeseburger lacking and greasy.  Cold grits (and small portion. Needed more to temper the spice level of the tomato sauce).  Dessert was .. adequate.   We will not be back. I'm sorry to say I had better food at Popeye's 2 days later.   Very sad that if I want decent food, I have to cook it myself (and yes, I do have a palate)",

We tried the deviled eggs; tasty but nothing that I'd order again, they just have a wow factor, no particular distinct favors just your usual deviled egg.  We both had the asparagus salad and it was very good, lots of fresh vegetables the asparagus was grilled to perfection soft but still has a good crunch. I had the sea bass, very fresh with great favor, again lots of fresh vegetables, great if you are seeking something light. My husband had the pork Oslo bucco and he loved it. He said it was fork tender, he enjoyed the red pepper spetzel that came with it and said it was very filling and he took 1/2 home. We had the bacon cheddar biscuits with apple butter, very good warm and flakey. We got 2 desserts. I had the pecan pie; it was okay but not anything special as far as pecan pie goes probably the crust was the best part. The cream cheese ice createwas good but I wouldn't this again. My husband ordered the chocolate bacon s'mores,unique the combo went well together especially with the homemade marshmallows but he said he wouldn't order it again. As far  as service it was okay. We felt as if our waitress was disinterested.  t was noisy, we were near a blower of some sort which was fighting against the background music. It's also not a romantic setting especially for an anniversary dinner although the restaurant did put a candle in ice cream to commemorate the event. All-in-all we may give Beckett's Table a second try.",

I hoped the bacon s'mores would finish things on a better foot, but eh...  It was all just ok. It is all as if they had high hopes of being unique and different but just couldn't evolve!

Atmosphere - Open layout and open kitchen, but the noise level is not too loud. Very comfortable.  Service - It wasn't too busy when we started so we received attention but I felt rushed. I realize that the kitchen wasn't busy but the app dishes were barely up when the main plates were down.   Food - One main dish was a fail but otherwise the food was excellent. Deviled Egg of the Day - Wow, what a pleasant surprise. I can't even remember how it was prepped other than the smoked cashews but what a innovative way to start the meal. In the future I'll try whatever the DED is. Shrimp, Sausage & Grits appetizer - Another great dish to start. The serving size is perfect to get the great flavors in the dish. The shrimp was buttery and not over cooked. The sausage was sliced thin and had great flavor but not spicy. The grits were the creamiest I've had and the jus that was added was rich. Port Osso Bucco - A dish I'd go back for. The pork was moist and flavorful. The spaetzle was great and had a crunch to it, assuming from the carrot. Fork Tender Short Ribs - This was the fail, and for a signature dish it was even more disappointing. The ribs were either too lean or overcooked & held too long, but the sauce they put over the top wasn't enough to keep them from being dry. The mashed potatoes were bland. Dessert - The Chocolate Dipped Bacon Smores was a deconstructed smore with each item having great flavor but difficult to eat. I wouldn't go back to this one.  I'll go back to try some of the other dishes, but won't go back for the short ribs.",

When I go to restaurants on a business trip I am usually by myself and generally end up reading a book while I eat, but the folks that work here are so pleasant that I've found myself just enjoying the food and the banter with them.  Dishes I have tried are the osso bucco (on a visit last autumn) and the tenderbelly pork chop (this evening) and both were amazing.

    "text": "The second restaurant I tried for Arizona Restaurant Week.  It was packed at 8 PM on a Thursday.  Ambiance was nice.  Loved the t-shirt for sale.  Tried: house smoked onion and potato soup, crispy toasted cheese chips - YUM! deep fried deviled eggs, hot sauce aioli, pickled fresno, pickles - YUCK!  Didn't care for this at all. spring pea pasta, double corn broth, spring greens - DELICIOUS pineapple upside down cake, amarena cherry ice cream - didn't care for the dense/eggy cake but the ice cream was the bomb.  My friend tried the Beckett's original green chili pork stew, corn bread, cotija cheese, cilantro and wasn't impressed but she did love the bacon chocolate s'mores, graham cracker, housemade marshmallow, caramel sauce, peanut butter mousse.  I would go back here again.",

The short ribs and Osso Buco were tender, fall off the bone, eat with a fork, no knife. Definitely worth the drive of 15 miles, will go back soon!",

And everyone was pleased with their meals except for me because I had 'dish envy'.  You know, the moment when you realize that everyone else's plate looks more delicious than yours. Yeah, I had the chicken 'n' dumplings.  It was good but not as good as the chewers who were eating the short ribs, cheeseburger, and the shrimp and andouille sausage.    Beckett's Table is a wide open space filled with tables! The decor is not overwhelming, but inviting. The atmosphere is cool and laid back. The staff was super friendly from the time I booked our group outing to being the very last people to go. Even then, there was no attitude that we had overstayed our welcome.  So, yeah, we have to go back!",

The Brussels sprout & bacon appetizer was really good (could have had more bacon), the short ribs were the best I've had served over mashed potatoes - yummm and finished splitting dessert with my boyfriend - he ordered flourless chocolate cake and I ordered the red velvet. I did not want this entire meal to end but deciding which dessert wounld be my last bite was so hard! Will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "The staff was very welcoming to us and our waiter was extremely pleasant informative and knowledgeable. It was hard to decide on starters because so many things sounded so comforting like grilled cheese sandwiches macaroni and cheese and deep fried deviled eggs. But we decided to start with the house made Burrata cheese plate. It came with two kinds of tasty bread, seasoned cashews and a house made cranberry sauce that made it special. Our waiter highly recommended the brussels Sprouts. I thought they were good but not something I would order again.  Both Fish Dinners they were offering came with pureed vegetables. I usually don't care for any vegetable pureed because the vegetable turns into baby food texture and usually is loaded up with lots of butter and cream and usually no longer taste like what it was. Or sometimes it is just a smear on your plate and reminds me of a dog scoot on a carpet.  But I wanted to order a fish dinner anyway because I look forward to fish dinners out because I can't buy fresh fish from any markets by me to make at home.  I was brave and decided to try the White Bass. The fish was fresh and steamed well but really had very little flavor on it's own but when you dipped the fish on the very flavorful carrot puree it had something going on there. Who knew the puree would work here. The puree wasn't too buttery or packed with too much cream it was actually intense with flavor and I'll give it a thumbs up. The vegetables were an unusual combination of fennel a slight amount of corn and poblano peppers. The poblanos were done in a way that gave crunch and texture to the dish.  My husband had the Osso Buco and it was terrific according to him. He also enjoyed the apple and onion spaetzle that came with it.  Prices seemed very reasonable, it was a good time out!",

I started out with the brussels sprouts. Roasted and served with pancetta and shaved manchego to create a fantastic appetizer.  If our moms had cooked them like this we would have loved brussels sprouts even as finicky kids.  Instead of an main entree I ordered the rock shrimp enchiladas.  Simply delicious!    At Katie's suggestion we tried the sweet potato pie which was a special that night.  It was wonderful and had a nice flaky, buttery crust.  This place is really hitting on all cylinders.

We were served (part of six) by the bartender who lacked attention of his dining room patrons.  Had to ask multiple times for additional drinks.   He took our orders but failed to ask if we wanted a salad or starter with our meal.  A shame because I was the only one to order a salad with my meal and it was the best thing.  Deserts were also MEH. Cream Brulee lacked any flavor.  Large pan of cobbler with a very small scoop of ice cream.  It did make 1/4 of the cobbler.   All in all just another average restaurant.  Nothing special.  Sorry.",

    "text": "My partner-in-dine and I had made a last-minute executive decision to spend a long weekend in Phoenix. On our continuing quest for culinary exploration, we listened to our gut (and fellow Yelpers) and made a same-day dinner reservation at Beckett's Table. I got us a reservation for 5:30 p.m. The place had just opened for dinner service when we arrived and so we got to choose where to sit. We settled for a half-booth with an unobstructed and central view of the whole restaurant. Our waitress was pleasant, efficient and attentive.   The partner-in-dine got the Manhattan to warm up his palate. He gave the drink a thumbs-up.   We decided to ignore the voice of the calorie-conscious part of our brains and just eat to our hearts' content. We got the mac & cheese with pancetta as appetizer. It was all right but didn't really knock our socks off.   For the entree, I went with the Signature Fork Tender Short Ribs and my partner-in-dine opted for the Petite Chicken with biscuit bacon stuffing. The thing that impressed me the most about Beckett's Table was the food presentation. As the Japanese like to say, \"We eat with our mouth and also with our eyes.\" It was visually pleasing to behold the dishes.  I liked my short ribs. The meat was tender and savory. The partner-in-dine was singing the chicken's praises the whole time. He was so pleased with his selection.  As an aficionado of desserts, I had to order the special dessert of the evening. It was mille-feuille with fresh strawberry and custard filling. I liked the tartness of the fruit and the crumbly goodness of the puff pastry.   We left Beckett's Table with a heavy stomach but a light heart.",

Definitely a different style of grits then we are used to. It was chunky and not smooth. I ordered the chicken and it was good. The chicken was a tad dry and not very flavorful. My husband ordered the cod and didn't like it too much. Cod is already a fish with no flavor and they steamed it, which I would say isn't the right way to make it, because it needs a ton of flavor. The best part of the whole meal was the dessert. We ordered the Smores. They were so delightfully sweet and perfect. Very unique with the bacon. Overall, giving this place a 4 star for good service and dessert. The food is about a 3.75.",

I have to say, atmosphere and service were absolutely great.. the food was good but I honestly expected just a bit more.   I ordered the short ribs, and my husband ordered the chicken after the waitress informed us they were known for both entrees. The short ribs were very tender and soft, over some vegetables and mashed potatoes. The vegetables were pretty plain, and the potato's didn't leave me wanting more. Overall it was an okay dish, nothing that I will be returning for. Same thing with my husbands chicken, it was good, but we have had much better. For the prices, I feel the dishes could be slightly more elevated.   Service was on point, and We both really enjoyed the ambiance. I was tempted to order some dessert but after the dinner that didn't live up to expectoration we left and grabbed dessert at a spot we knew would live up to our desires. Overall - good not great. I prefer his other restaurant Southern Rail!",

If you are a wine drinker they have half off AZ wines on Sundays.   We started with the pancetta cavatappi mac and cheese paired with bacon cheddar biscuits served along with apple butter--oh, my goodness. The mac and cheese is incredibly smooth and the red flakes add a burst of flavor. Apple butter on bacon cheddar biscuits, I would never have been so inventive and am I sure glad someone else came up with this mix because it sure is flavorful. For the main course my husband and I copied each other because it just looked so good: Signature Fork Tender Short Ribs. We were right to get the same thing, the ribs are fall-off-your-fork mouth-watering with creamy buttery mashed potatoes and vegetables. I was only able to take a few bites of everything in order to save room for their known-for Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'mores. The S'mores dessert is perfect for two and a wonderful way to end dinner, just absolutely exquisite!   Hands down an easy five stars; I will be coming back here every time I am in the area, no doubt. Thank you, Chef Justin Beckett for a full dining experience.",

    "text": "The restaurant week menu here is superb and one of your best deals out of all the restaurants participating. For $33 you get your choice of appetizer, main course, dessert, and a glass of wine or beer. You can also substitute a non alcoholic fountain beverage or coffee/tea instead of alcohol (The iced tea here is really good btw). Reservations were easy through Opentable.  The restaurant was a little hard to find for us, since the sign for Beckett's Table is in the main plaza area where Nook and Ocean Poke are, but the actual restaurant is around the corner past The Smith and a dry cleaning place. Once we found the restaurant our table was ready and waiting for us. The seating at our booth was ah, very cozy since we had to move the table forward to be able to scoot into our booth seating (And then scoot the table back in). All the restaurant week menu options sounded so delectable. I liked how the menu specified which selections were signature items so I went with those dishes they are known for- The chopped salad, short ribs, and chocolate flourless cake.   Note that if you want complimentary bread you'll have to ask for it. Our baskets had both whole wheat rolls and some sort of cheesy-red chile roll. While the rolls themselves were unremarkable the whipped butter was very light and slightly sweet- delicious!  The chopped salad was a beautiful sight of various colors and textures. The dressing was lightly sweet and perfectly balanced with the vegetables. The main course was a hearty portion of tender short rib perched on top of mashed potatoes, with perfectly cooked vegetables. The beurre blanc drizzled on top of the short rib was the finishing decadent touch. The beef was fork tender as described and had a rich deep flavor. I also had a bite of the cast iron chicken which was juicy and infused with a lovely blend of seasoning.  Dessert was also delightful. The chocolate cake was rich and I loved the sauce that came with it. I wouldn't have known it was flourless at all.   Timing was perfect in between each course and we all had our plates served, taken away, and next courses brought in at the same time. Drinks were refilled as needed, and our server was so friendly and sweet.   Overall it was a lovely meal and I'd love to go back again for dinner.  4.5/5",

Bartender and drinks were amazing and we were seated at our leisure. The restaurant was packed on Sat nite but our appetizer's & entree's arrived promptly without being rushed or waiting. Perfect timing!!! This was one of those rare laughing, sharing, amazing tastes meal that was enjoyed by all.   We met chef Beckett afterwards and I commented that my scallops were cooked to perfection, right up there with the old Roy's on Camelback back in the day. Surprise, surprise he was the chef who opened that location. Wow, that explains a lot!  When we're back in town the family owned Beckett's Table will be on our must do list.",

    "text": "Beckett's is an ok place. Good food and drinks. Nothing spectacular. But (and admitting my bias, all restaurants that do this irk me) having Happy Hour prices apply only in the bar, when the bar is basically part of the dining room is just not cool. In particular at Beckett's when we asked about HH prices the server told us we could move to the adjacent (4 feet away) group table and have HH pricing. Of course the staff had occupied 2/3s of the table to assemble what appeared to be pie boxes (Tuesday before Thanksgiving) so the idea was not exactly appealing.  Yes I know that there is probably some great marketing genius behind this decision, but for me, I'll just move on down the road to a place that allows customers to enjoy a HH no matter where they sit.",

I got dressed up and headed over, the parking seemed a bit limited and it was packed but luckily there was room at the bar. The bartenders were all so friendly and I ordered the Palmaire(?) which was okay. They're known for their wine list, I should have had that instead. I ordered the cast iron chicken with a side of mashed potatoes (which could be split between two people easily). Let me just say that it was one of the best meals I have had in awhile. Every bite was heavenly. The cheddar bacon biscuit stuffing had this perfect texture on the outside but was tender on the inside. My chicken was perfectly cooked and my mashed potatoes were buttery. I did not want to stop eating which was a mistake because I promptly needed to nap right after. I've been daydreaming about this meal for two nights now, I will absolutely be back with friends or on a date.   Date Rating: 5 out of 5. I took myself on a date! Eventually the men are draining and I have to remember to treat myself and take a break. I spent it reading and texting girlfriends back. It was much needed.",

The service was great, our waiter helped us make wine selections and food selections. The corn bread and noble bread were delicious! I'd come back for their corn bread alone, it was even topped with avocado! Unusual but a welcome surprise. I got the cod which was light and flaky, and we had a side of the bacon stuffing to share which was delicious. I'd highly recommend getting that for the table to share. A few of my friends had the cheeseburger and short ribs and they were also pleased with their meals. The dessert menu looked good but we were too full from our meals to try anything.",

Clearly the service was the only thing that was good but the food was generally uninspiring.    The appetizer of the Salad and the Roasted Cauliflower made for great pictures but nothing else.  The entree of the short ribs was good and the only highlight but the Steam Fish seemed to have been over cooked and kinda hard.  The the dessert of the Fllourless Cake was more of a Petite Brownie and the Pana Cotta had no flavor at all.   Restaurant Week is a way for a restaurant to showcase their menu that will hopefully bring customers back, but clearly the menu and the food in general was very uninspiring to say the least and not even the compelling value of the Restaurant Week would bring us back.",

    "text": "Wow to say I'm disappointed is an understatement. I read so many glowing reviews but our experience here was so subpar and lackluster. First off there is so much activity but nothing getting done - I'm pretty sure there was a guy who's whole job was to distract two of the chefs and stick spoons in things - we were there for 2 hours and that's all he did for real. If we wanted any semblance of service we had to flag out waitress down and she was usually no where to be seen - once we even flagged a different waitress to go get ours as we hadn't been helped and hadn't seen her in a good 15 minutes. She had our bill with our card for a good 10 minutes at the end of our meal as well while she chatted with a coworker for 6 then helped another table where the man physically went to get her to help him. That is so ridiculous in my mind. Now on to the food. We got deviled eggs as apps and they were okay - nothing to write home about bland and over salted. I got the corn cakes for dinner as everything looked a bit heavy and they were actually fine - not memorable but nothing to complain about. My husband got the burger and it was HEAVY, super greasy, and could have used some fresh condiments like lettuce, tomatoes, onions to make it a lighter more palatable burger. Instead it comes with more bacon (some is cooked in the meat as well), cheese, and a very sad amount of mustard and pickles. It was not good. Then we decided \"hey this can't get worse\" well it did the chocolate torte was like eating coco flavored chalk - it was an awful meal. All in all save yourself the trip DONT COME HERE.",

Front of the house was managed by a husband & wife team that seem to have perfected the art of running a high end restaurant!

Atmosphere is nice and pleasant, however the open floor plan makes it a bit noisy. Food seemed reasonably priced and portions were sufficient. Service was excellent.   Food: For starters we had the soup, which had a good consistency but lacking. It was too sweet and not enough earthy flavors. The shrimp was decent but nothing special.  For entrees we had the shepherd's pie, which was was not thick enough,  bland, and not even as good as the one you can get at Costco. The crispy whitefish over dirty rice was tasty but lacking a nice sauce to help the overall dry consistency of the dish. Someone else at the table had the pulled pork and said it was good but not great.  The best part of our meals were the desserts, chocolate covered bacon s'mores and coconut cake. Both would be worthy closers to a nice meal.",

    "text": "What can I say, I'm in love! I'm all for any restaurant that has a designated gluten-free menu and features Arizona wines. I had to wait a few weeks for a Beckett's trip to fit into my schedule (since they're closed Mondays), but it was totally worth it.   I would first recommend to follow their Facebook and Twitter to figure out their specials before you go. I had eye-balled their cherry pork tacos before I went, and asked the server with puppy-dog eyes if they were gluten free. Thankfully they were. The waiter was super adorable, and has a family full of celiacs, so he totally gets the diet and was really sweet about my \"situation.\" I was also called \"dear\" several times, which was mildly endearing and warmed me up to ordering a second glass of wine.   My also adorable date had the fire roasted green chile pork stew, and although it looked slightly tasty - isn't really my thing, and wasn't gluten-free. Neither were the cheddar biscuits that were served with the meal, but there's no harm in smelling them while your eyes roll back in your head and drool. Unless other celiacs say that this isn't part of the diet.   The cherry pork tacos, although not part of their summer menu, were mind-blowingly good. They were so simple, yet so tasty. I can't believe that the special cherries made the meal, it's definitely the talent seen here. Dear American comfort food, I love you.  The wine list is extensive and offers lots of Arizona wines that are just too good to all have in one sitting (unless you're into that). The cocktails are...interesting. Although none of them are really my \"thing,\" I appreciate a menu with a great cocktail list.   Prices are, eh, prices that you would expect from this sort of restaurant. Entree prices are comparable to that of True Food, and I think their wines were priced fairly. As a celiac, I would say these two are really good date restaurants or girlfriend night away.   I would make a reservation, even though some nights are apparently slow. Better safe than sorry, especially if you could enjoy Beckett's food.   I will definitely come back here. Again, I would recommend this for any celiac on an adorable date. Or even non-adorable date. Or just alone eating pork tacos at the bar which I may end up doing very soon.  Also, since I always include a bathroom review on here: they are very nice individual bathrooms. They even have light-up make-up mirrors. That's the type of small additions that can really make a restaurant. Nice one.",

I mean there was absolutely no seasoning what so ever and it was served with a cold beet salad that made the fish cold almost instantly...major fail. My boyfriend got the mussels, they were better but still not fantastic. The other person in our party got the pork green chili and she said it was \"pretty good\". Now for dessert, we split the brown butter ice cream and the chocolate covered bacon s'mores, oh my god they were to die for. So, yes we will be back but next time we will skip the pricey entrees and stick with a bunch of small plates.",

My food was delicious - they gave me waay to much crispy fish (2 large filets), however it was cooked perfectly and paired well with the rice.  My dessert frosting was good, cake was a bit dry.  My friends ordered the s'mores dessert which came with chocolate covered bacon! They liked it if you're into the sweet salty baconey thing!  The red wine was so young the grapes were crying to get back in their bottle, so I ended up splurging on a much nicer glass of wine.

I ordered the signature fork tender, \"lip smackin\" Short Ribs.  One word, awesome!  At first glance, you'd think that the portion was on the small size; however, do not be fooled.  After completing that meal, I was content and satisfied.  The Short Ribs was truly what it advertised, and each bite was full of rich flavors.    Already giving the \"thumbs up\" to a wonderful meal that I just had, I didn't anticipate the luscious dessert that was to come: Coconut cake with Brown Butter Ice Cream sitting on top a drizzle of White and Milk Chocolate.  I've had my share of coconut cakes in the past; however, this one was unique because they toasted the coconut and rolled it around this perfectly square piece of cake.  Advice: ask for an extra side of milk chocolate to dip your cake into!  Although they could've left out the smoked cashews, this dessert was absolutely \"heavenly\"!  The service was great and the ambiance was vibrant yet relaxed.  I noticed alot of families (maybe because it was Father's Day), a bunch of ladies, men at the bar watching the TV screens,  and also couples.  A restaurant for all!",

The beef melted in my mouth while the mashed potatos gave me comfort. We finished with the Bacon Smor's with a nice Tani Port. Great combo.  The entire staff was very friendly and helpful especially Our waiter. On our way out we spoke to Chef Justin Beckett. He was not only talented but a very nice host.",

    "text": "Visiting Phoenix from Central Pennsylvania. Saw an advertisement in a travel magazine, was initially skeptical. Menu online looked good, plenty of gluten free selections for my wife (easy to read, well labeled). Made a reservation online, noted that one party had a gluten allergy. Arrived early, friendly staff who graciously accepted us early (we arrived about 15-20 minutes early). Did not pawn us off on the bar, but instead asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. We picked inside. Outside had nice variety of tables and a nice open fire, great \"foody\" smell that really drew you in. Once seated, team member came over with glasses and poured water for us. Menu was great, server came over and noted the allergy and went through the menu with my with my wife and discussed substitution options. Great drink menu, good selection. Great timing of appetizers and entrees. My wife had the salmon rillettes, which were absolutely delicious. She also had the cast iron petite chicken (with mashed potatoes instead of the stuffing). Great presentation, chicken cooked perfectly, great flavors. Best mashed potatoes that I have ever had in a restaurant. I had the beckett's table signature fork tender short ribs. Also got a side of the wood oven roasted bacon biscuit stuffing. All I can say is WOW... Truly fork tender, and truly awesome. I love stuffing, sad but True. This was the best stuffing that I have ever had. Presentation was perfect, stuffing side came in a small cast iron dish. Nice little aside, there are pig figurines throughout the restaurant. When asked, learned that folks have been ending them since they opened. Awesome little thing that is fun to check out all around the restaurant. I would definitely recommend, and hope to make it back sooner rather than later!",

    "text": "a restaurant for the locally conscious. our server did a wonderful job recommending items to us, and telling us about bt. i was recovering from food poisoning (and why did we decide to eat out? sigh. i dunno.), so i may have enjoyed it even more if i was my 100% chubster self. but alas, i was still a bit anorexic at that time.  The famed Mac&Cheese - uhm. it was ok? I want my mac and cheese to be luscious and gooey, and it was more of a light alfredo-type of sauce. and the \"mac\" was those ridged twisty ones. the proper italian pasta name evades me. but you know what i'm talking about. i would prob not order this again.  Pork osso bucco with spaetzle - uhm, is it just me or is spaetzle the new carb trend? i dunno, but i'm really not a fan. i dunno why. i think i was wanting beef, but i ordered pork. it was SUPER tender, cooked perfectly, but i just couldn't eat more of it.   B-burger - excellent. cooked PERFECTLY. juicy, luscious, all those adjectives that you want your burger to emulate. it could use something to give it a bit of a punch though - something a wee bit tart? or salty? overall, very good. would DEFINITELY do this again.  Bread - i know, i know, we didn't order this and it's free. but it was SOOOO good. the husband is in love with the cheese bread rolls - which taste italian-inspired, with sundried tomatoes, rosemary, and of course, cheese. delish. even the whole wheat rolls were delectable!  Now..... temporary anorexia/food poisoning recovery and all... i liked this place, and will definitely be back to eat it up.",

The service is right on point and the food is so comforting, delicious and perfectly done. I adore the setup of the restaurant.  They have a great patio with heaters and misters, and the atmosphere throughout is so inviting and cozy.  Foodwise, the beet appetizer are hands-down the BEST beets I have ever had, and you also can't go wrong with the brussel sprouts.  Whatever fish is on the menu is always great and I'm also a big fan of their short ribs and burger.  They have many gluten-free options on the menu for those gluten-conscious diners.  Make sure to try the fig and pecan pie, too!",

They had menus printed for our group, they  decorated with tons of candles and they had the most amazing staff helping out that night. All I our guests loved their food and have been raving about it since. We had gone there for dinner for years and we will continue to go back because the food is amazing!!!

    "text": "Almost want to dock them another star for the way we were treated when we first arrived. Went there fro the first time a few weeks ago.  We were meeting another couple for dinner and were actually planning to go to another restaurant, but decided at the last minute to try Beckett's. It was a Saturday night at 5pm ... they just opened.  The host that greeted us, said we could have a table, but that we had to order quickly and MUST be done no later than 6:15pm.  He said he absolutely needed the table back by then because the restaurant would be completely full by 6:30pm.  Long story short .... not True.  The place was quite busy and full, but there were at least 3-4 tables available the entire time we were there.  In fact, when we told the waiter we needed to order and eat fast, he laughed.  He said, \"Don't be silly. Take your time. No need to hurry.\" What???  Anyway, on to the food.  Good food, interesting menu, with some unique dishes. Started with the deep fried deviled eggs. It was a nice twist to a classic dish, but lacked enough flavor punch to make it something truly special. The grilled cheese and bacon cheddar biscuits were tasty comfort food. Our table ordered the short ribs, salmon, osso bucco and scallop special.  All were quite satisfying. I wanted to try the chicken and dumplings, but the waiter steered us away from that and toward the cast iron chicken ... maybe we'll try it next time.",

Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco, green chile stew and pecan/fig pie), but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout.  So many places have arrogant, stuffy service, so Scottsdale.  Not so here.  Also, the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why.  Elegant but comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef, who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us).  The food is rich, but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce.  Perfect portion size, with a balance - meat, grains and veggies.  So happy that Beckett's is in the neighborhood! (Oh - and no valet!  I  hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot, and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots.)",

I really loved the atmosphere -- especially the blazing fire on the patio (too bad it was too cold to sit outside).  The service was warm, friendly and just the right amount of attentive.  The food was excellent.  We tried the grits and sausage (I didn't eat the sausage), which were nice.  I ordered the roasted chicken with cheddar bacon bisquit stuffing and my friend ordered the short ribs and we also tried the mashed potatoes.  My dinner was delicious (and the potatoes ARE ridiculously good as claimed!).  After reading reviews, we had to try the coconut cake w/butter ice cream and coconut pudding and the s'mores with chocolate-covered bacon and whipped peanut butter.  I wouldn't order the s'mores again.  While the chocolate-covered bacon was interesting, I think this dish would be better if it was not served deconstructed.  Our marshmellows were not toasted enough (they were difficult to eat) and the dish was just dry as a result.  The coconut cake, on the other hand, was FANTASTIC.  I would definitely order that again.  I cannot wait to return.",

My mom came in from out of town and I was unsure about taking her here since we lean more towards the vegetarian fare, but it was a wonderful choice.  Katie (one of the owners we learned after talking with her) greeted us and gave us a little history and run down about all of the drinks.  They all had some personal meaning to her which made our experience there more special!  After hearing about the Pimm's Cup I asked her about the history; she told me a little bit and then 5 minutes later came back with a little print up about it for me! This was all within the first 10 minutes of sitting down!  We ordered the waiters recommendations of short ribs and pork (osco bosso something!).  We enjoyed both, but I think when we go back we would lean more towards the short ribs!  We enjoyed dinner, apps, drinks so much we decided \"Why stop there?!\"  The fig and pecan pie with a homemade citrus ice cream was to die for!  Homemade everything made this just an overall delicious meal!! Definitely one of my first recommendations!",

After calling about ten different restaurants only to hear there were no reservations until after 9pm, I decided to give this place a try.  I had heard great reviews of this new restaurant.  There was no wait when we arrived and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather on the patio.  The menu had a lot of great sounding items and our server recommended the Osso Bucco and the Short Ribs.  I decided on the chopped salad to start and the Short Ribs for my entree.  Both dishes were very good.  My companion tried the Osso Bucco which was not as tasty as my dish and seemed to be lacking in the amount of meat for the price.  My son tried the kid's sliders which also were very tasty.  And last but not least, we finished the meal with the chocolate cake which was delicious.  The service was highly attentive although the food took way to long to come out (they were not busy at all).  Also, the food seems to be a bit overpriced.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal and will probably be back.",

First, the dude at the door was full on rude to my friend while she was waiting for me. Going on a Sunday night and the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty, she still got attitude from an older man working the hostess stand.  He basically snapped at her as she was standing near the front door waiting for me and ordered her to move away from the door and that she 'had' to wait at the bar.  She almost wanted to leave after, but we opted to stick it out and not let some crabby guy dictate our plans.  We sat at the bar and were happily greeted by the bartender.  The Happy Hour offers $5 wines and $6 small plates.  The wine list was surprisingly nice and featured domestic and even French wines to choose from. Nice.    The HH small plates offers a wide variety of selections and I ignored my gut and ordered the Grits with Sausage and Mustard.    I'm sorry, but no.  I blame myself. I know better than to order grits here in the desert because they just don't get it here.  These were extremely watery grits. Very thin. And the mustard sauce was overwhelming. I love mustard, it's my favorite condiment, really.  But it was too much mustard for the weak grits. The sausage pieces were delicious, however.  My friend ordered the duck confit.  We were both surprised that it was a cold dish.  While the duck was cooked perfectly it was another dish that was overwhelmed with mustard.  What's with the mustard?    Granted, we only each ordered a small plate and we did have excellent service at the bar in spite of the rude man at the front; we may check it out again, but like I said I do not get it.",

Super succulent with an excellent quinoa radish and edamame mix.  I was actually sort of surprised by how good it was.  Went with the advice of the waiter and couldn't be happier.  The lady had the chicken which was probably the best preparation I have had.  Super moist, served on an awesome bacon stuffing....could have eaten a bowl of stuffing all on its own.

We were originally seated outside but when it started to rain we were quickly moved into a table indoors (they do have covered outdoor seating but there was a leak where we were sitting so we got wet)  and had all food moved indoors without an issue.   I ordered their pasta special as they have a gluten free option which is very rare for most restaurants, and it was fantastic! My friend had the Scottish salmon and said it was delicious.   Due to the rain incident we were even given a basket of zucchini chips to munch on and I am not a huge fan of them, these were pretty good. Not something I'd order but a thankful and welcome surprise.  Just for how accommodating the staff was I will definitely be back",

So I tried cast iron pettit chicken.... The skin left on the chicken was slimy.. okay- no problem I can just take it off. It came with stuffing , which I got excited about BUT was dry and cold. So I wasn't happy w. My dish. My husband got green chili stew and the meat was hard.. stale almost and it had a flavor of plastic. As if it was cooked or warmed up in a plastic bag. For appetizers we got deviled eggs. Mediocre. And biscuits which was amazing! Cooked perfect. Unfortunately biscuits isn't enough to go back.",

    "text": "Huge letdown for a birthday gathering. We booked the large patio table, but when we arrived they first tried to sit us at a table for 4, inside. When we tried to explain we had reserved the patio, and that our party wouldn't fit at the table, the hostess had to go back and have a staff conference before leading us outside to the nearly empty patio.  We told the staff taking the reservation we were there for a birthday, we told the hostess we were there for a birthday, we told the waitress we were there for a birthday, we heard the staff singing happy birthday to another table.  Not only did we not get any acknowledgement of the birthday we were celebrating, but they forgot to give the birthday boy the cookie that is included in the kids meal. After taking care of the check we told them they forgot his birthday AND his cookie, they brought out the cookie with a candle in it.  We had just seen them do much more for another table, and they had initially forgotten his dessert entirely.   There were other issues as well. The wait staff was inattentive, but VERY handsy, which was off putting.  Someone would come over, put a hand on your shoulder or pat you on the back, I'm assuming to foster some sort of intimacy, but then not listen to what you were saying. We asked about appetizers on the happy hour menu and the waitress cut us off rambling off choices.  At the end of the night we asked about the pricing on the bill and were informed then that happy hour is only in the bar area.  The time to have told us that was when we asked earlier, and perhaps if the waitress didnt cut us off she would have understood our question better.  I also didn't appreciate the patronizing \"Awww is it too spicy for you\" by wait staff after not liking my entree.  I've eaten hundreds of green chili stews, the point is generally to showcase green chili's, but here they do everything possible to eradicate any semblance of  green chili flavor. Its sickly sweet and overloaded with corn.  It might be OK if they called it something else, but as a green chili stew, it was the worst I've had.",

The menu doesn't seem to have changed much but there are some differences, probably because I came around the same time last year and the food is seasonal.  I had the Flat Iron Steak this time. I was worried it would be tough, I am very spoiled by my well marbled ribeyes.  This steak was so tender, i was completely shocked.  It comes precut, as it does in many high end places.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, one of hte most flavorful steaks that also was tender.",

Unfortunately our waitress wasn't the friendliest and seemed very uninterested in her job and the place she worked. The waitress knew I didn't eat meat , but still let me order the s'more dessert that was covered in bacon. Needless to say, I didn't eat it. To clarify; I do not eat mammal meat, but I do eat fish!  Aside from that, I loved the patio where we sat--but I think I had the weather to thank for that. My salmon was tasty, but not the best I have had. I loved that they paired edamame with it--very unique and I will take that trick home with me. I should have ordered the Grilled Veggie plate because my girlfriend ordered it and I ended up eating some of it, but I wanted to get some protein.  My salad was ok; not amazing. I did love that they included shaved radishes on the salad. That is also something I don't see often.  Beckett's is a return visit; but certainly with a different waitress and I will probably explore the menu a little more. Next time I hope to give it 5 stars, because I think the place is capable.",

Its my absolutely favorite so I had to order that. It was okay, not the best but I still enjoyed it.  We had Fried Deviled Eggs & Bacon Cheddar Biscuits to start. Biscuits were yummy and I thought it was strange that it was served with apple butter but after tasting it, it worked. The deviled eggs were okay... I'll probably try something else next time.  For entrees, it was hard for me to decide. I was going back and forth between the Pork Osso Bucco Confit & the Short Ribs. Our server had me sold on the pork when she mentioned it was her favorite thing on the menu. I am so glad she did. I absolutely loved it. The pork was so tender. The Spaetzel with pancetta was delicious also. I loved the sauce that it was in. I haven't had a dish that Wow'd me in a very, very long time and this one definitely did.   BF had the Green Chile Stew (we originally planned to go to Rokerij). He enjoyed it, but I did not. It was too sweet for my taste which I didn't expect from it. He thought the cornbread was lacking in flavor and preferred to eat it with the cheddar biscuits we ordered.   Service was good. We sat at the community table. I like that there are options between dining table, patio, community table or bar. Our server was very attentive & informative.  I'll have to go back to try the short ribs but I think it will be hard for me to come by again and not get the pork again. It's been a week and I am still thinking about it!",

The food is really good (we love the skillet feta appetizer that they have) and it's nice to have a more upscale place that offers so many gluten free and vegetarian options. The wine list is great and they participate in the 1/2 off bottle on Sundays and the cocktails are great. The beer list doesn't have a ton of depth, so if you are looking to have beer here don't go in with your expectations high in that area. Other than that, it's a great atmosphere for a dinner where you don't want to be really casual, but you also don't want to be fancy - a less casual nice night out! The pork stew is also amazing. Besides the beer list feedback, I do wish the menu items rotated a bit more often than they currently do.",

For libations, I suggest ordering the miss katie's pimms cup as it is light (probably not on calories) and refreshing. The appetizers are pretty filling especially the mac and cheese (large portion and enough to share). The super creamy grits & schreiner's sausage trio was a bit rich for my taste yet worth a try if you like comfort food. The beckett's original grilled cheese with pancetta was not my favorite as it was more bread than cheese and very heavy for the belly.  The beats and brussels sprouts had good flavor and a nice mix to your appetizer choice. They do have patio seating yet it was a bit chilly so we opted to sit indoors. Overall, good service and good food for a reasonable price.",

Our waiter was awesome, we described our desired taste and he made a spot-on recommendation, and it wasn't the most expensive bottle (I'm looking at you, D-Vine).   Once again, my food was spectacular. Every time I've been has been with a different group with at least one person experiencing this place for the first time. I love everything from the warm ambience, the variety but clear direction of the menu, and the awesome staff and my friends and family agree.

Next, I ordered beef short ribs with a red onion demi-glace.  The dish was served with mashed potatoes and an assortment of sauteed vegetables.  The delicious entree was very moist, tender and flavorful.  The vegetables were fresh and chopped into nice sized bites.  Last, I had a flourless chocolate cake with whipped cream and coffee butterscotch sauce.  I did not care for the cake very much.  It was too thick and dry for my liking.  The sauce did not make it moist enough.  I would have rather had something else.  I like cake that is light and airy.  Equally important, the server we had made me feel like a valued customer and provided excellent service.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't written a review of this neighborhood gem! We've been coming here for years. I LOVE their community driven, local lovin', farm-to-table concept. Their food is always SO fresh and the overall experience is just great.   I tend to be a creature of habit so I pretty much always go for the Mac 'n' Cheese and deviled egg of the day to start and then their signature short ribs for dinner. Oh man, the short ribs are SO dang dreamy and 'fork tender' just like they tell ya.  They have incredibly fresh and perfectly balanced cocktails so you most definitely need to start with one of those and then head on over to their lovely wine list, chosen by their in-house Sommelier. They have great local AZ options which makes my heart happy!   If you're looking to plan a dinner for 10-16 people, they have an awesome community table that would be the perfect fit. AND (i'm hesitant to even let this secret out) they have happy hour until 6p with tasty bites, cocktails, beer and wine all for a great deal!   We'll see you again soon, BT! Thank you for being one of our favorites, time and time again!",

I love the large wine list and all the local AZ wines.However, I was totally displeased with two things: how overpriced the entrees are, and that literally most of the menu is pork! I could not even order the burger without bacon because bacon is in the patty. For pork eaters, this is probably the place for you. I am a major food lover but I have one rule: no pork. I found it really hard to pick something that I liked because my only options were a) salad b) chicken. I personally do not think this particular restaurant warrants charging $25+ an entree. That said, the food tasted good, but it wasn't the best I'd ever had.",

I went last Wednesday and after pleasant conversation at the table some of the food started to arrive.  I'm not sure what the chef had in mind but obviously it was all about the carbs.  First a sliced beet salad (good), some stuffed bread with sun dried tomatoes on top (good), then seasoned potato wedges, suguaro roll (super sized pigs in a blanket), and chicken salad on bread halves.  Now you tell me does that sound like a dinner worth $48?  Wendy Werth",

Eating out is a holistic experience, food being one component, service the other.  Beckett's scores well on both counts.  It is an honor to applaud businesses exceeding the norm.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to Beckett's Table for our Valentine's day dinner. We were so excited to try a new restaurant and we had heard great things about this particular one and we were not disappointed.  We made a reservation through open table and when we arrived (even a little early), we were seated immediately. Parking can be a little tricky right in front of the restaurant, but just a short walk away is a larger parking lot, so parking is not too challenging (and there is no complimentary valet). Our server was great and very attentive. We ordered the cast iron corn cake for our appetizer. We enjoyed the different flavors and textures present within the dish. For our entrees, I ordered their popular short ribs and my boyfriend ordered the cast iron petite chicken. My dish was extremely flavorful and the short ribs were so tender I didn't even need my knife. The mashed potatoes were very smooth and the red onion Demi-glace was delicious. The chicken was incredibly moist, but that wasn't even the best part of the dish. The bacon biscuit stuffing was like nothing I've had before. Do yourself a favor and order it as a side if it doesn't come with your dish. I was probably most excited about dessert because that is my favorite part of any meal, but I must say I was slightly disappointed. We ordered the fig & pecan pie, which comes with a citrus zest cream cheese ice cream. The pie was pretty good, but honestly nothing spectacular, but the ice cream was definitely unique. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I still enjoyed the dish.",

Arrived on a Saturday night, and the hostess wasn't all that kind, although she did get us seated on the heated patio right away. That's a plus!   We ordered Mac n cheese for an appetizer and the actual mustard seeds were overbearing. Not what we expected based on the menu's description of Mac n cheese.   We also ordered the deviled eggs for another appetizer. Nothing memorable.   And finally, all three of us in the party ordered the cheeseburger. (Other menu items sounded appetizing, but we saw other tables get their food delivered, and the portions seemed too small to justify prices.) It took nearly an hour for our burgers and fries to be delivered. Two of us left our plates full and couldn't finish. One of us ate most of the plate but woke up feeling sick overnight.   The waitress didn't seem to care that two plates were essentially un-eaten. Total bill for 3 customers was over $90+.   Sorry, I can't recommend this place.",

I recently saw Chef Justin on Food Network's Chopped and fell in love with the restaurant from the pre-roll footage and knew I wanted to eat there ASAP. It looked absolutely adorable on TV, and it's much more charming in person! Luckily for me they were apart of AZ Spring Restaurant Week and could accommodate myself and some friends for dinner!   Originally our group was to have 10, so we would have to do one check + 20% added gratuity. We had a couple of last-minute no shows so they were happy to split the check for us at that point. Our server was amazing- Chef & co are lucky to have her! I was impressed that particular evening Chef expo'd & touched every plate leaving his kitchen. One of my friends noted her main course veggies were tepid, but I told her it probably was due to Chef inspecting every plate. Yeah, they weren't piping hot but I'm not complaining.   It's funny, all 6 of us ordered the same AZRW courses minus 2 girls who got the corn soup appetizer: local sausages/pretzel roll/mustard, short ribs, and the flourless chocolate cake. We all definitely did not pass up the glass of AZ wine that came with our meal too. Perfect touch to a great meal!",

I couldn't even wait for the check to arrive before I was rushing to the bathroom. Check in, check out, if you know what I mean. I also ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits. Pass on that as well. The best thing was the apple butter.   My friends ordered seasonal vegetables and steamed cod. They all liked their meals but i got the worst of it.  I couldn't even sit through the entire play before I was rushing to the bathroom again.  This was followed by extreme chills and my stomach is still upset the following day.

They also had sausage, a nice added bonus.   The bacon stuffing was good but a bit dry. I ended up dipping the dry bread in my grits to remedy that and it helped. I didn't taste much bacon either.

I'm not a huge fan of curry flavor and found it to be an odd combination with the fish.  Husband ordered the short ribs which he graciously shared a bite with me. They were super tasty!

    "text": "Sometimes you have to listen to an album 3 times before you decide if you like it, love it or loathe it.... For this reason, i'm really trying to resist the temptation to review a spot after just one visit.  This weekend i hit Beckett's for the third time.  Everyone is raving about Beckett's and with fair reason, it's pretty good.  But let's drill down a bit further and see if it's really all it's cracked up to be.    Apps:  * Brussels Sprouts are good, but i think it's just a trendy item to toss onto your menu these days.   * The enchiladas are alright, but they don't \"wow\" anyone.  let's face it... this just isn't the place for enchiladas in the PHX.   * What is wrong with this: \"beckett's original grilled cheese with pancetta (aka bacon)\"  [Hint: \"aka\"] Pancetta is not Bacon.  Pancetta, like bacon, is also made from pork belly,  But pancetta is rolled and cured, bacon is smoked. The flavor is decidedly different.    Mains: * The short ribs are great... but then again, i never met a short rib that i didnt like.  I'm a sucker for short ribs on a menu.   * Chicken & Dumplings... major let down.  (They were out of short ribs, so i asked the server for a reco.)  Dumplings were pretty uneventful.  Chicken was tender, but dude... its chicken.   *  Tasted the Osso Buco and it was pretty tasty.    Cocktails and Beer: Drinks are well poured and fairly inventive.  Not too shabby. Beer list is so so... some 4peaks and a Stella.  nothing really exciting.    Dessert: i *love* the hot/cold combo, so i'll practically make love to anything \"a la mode\"   ....naturally the poached pear & blueberry cobbler with ice cream was on my list.   It was about 6000 degrees and you couldnt really taste it.  Also, the icecream was tiny and you need more for the cobbler.  However, the chocolate covered bacon (note: not pancetta, so they clearly know the difference, they just think you are dumb when you read the apps menu.) and PB s'mores were to die for!    Seriously... this desert is creative, delicious and hands down the best $5 you'll spend all night.    Bottom line is... Beckett's is pretty good grub, nice ambiance (for a strip mall) and a pretty good menu.  The food isnt amaaaaaaaazing, but it's worth checking out.  If you do anything, come for the s'mores.    3.6 stars.... okay fiiiiiiiine... 4.",

    "text": "YUM. This place is awesome. I am glad that everywhere we went before this that night had a long wait because I had been wanting to come here for a while. Our server was really nice and gave us some great recommendations. We tried the deep fried deviled eggs which I thought were really good (definitely an interesting taste, but a good one), and they were served with a really good hot sauce aioli. My boyfriend and I both got the short ribs which came highly recommended and they were AMAZING. Yummmm. So tender and great flavor, and the mashed potatoes were great as well. I got a red wine recommended by the server and it was really good too. Our friend got the osso bucco which I tried also. It was okay but I didn't like it nearly as much as the short ribs. Good ambiance and I will definitely be coming back. The patio looked really nice but it was way too hot on this particular day to sit out there.",

Child's quasadilla wasn't as popular but our server noticed, apologized and asked to replace it, they took it off our bill. Our dishes were D-lish! The cast iron chicken, searen salmon and shepherd's pie. The clams weren't as good but still enjoyable. We really enjoyed it and we look forward to going again soon !",

    "text": "A restaurant whose mantra is \"Come Together.\" How bad can it be? The question for this place is how far from bad is it? I'm a fan now. What's more is I think I could be friends with the owner. Anyone who puts up pictures of Audrey Hepburn and Julia Child, two icons I've always respected, in the ladies' rooms is good peoples. The vibe here is very warm and welcoming. One of the owners greeted me at the door with \"Get yourself out of the cold!\" I liked how even though he was wearing a plaid shirt and casual pants, he wasn't taking away from the upscale vibe. The only thing he took away was pretentiousness.  Love the not too daunting menu. My gal pals and I split the country pate--made with ground chicken. It was very good but I liked the other things on the plate--cheese, pickles, sundried tomato and fried capers. Their brussel sprouts appetizer was very yummy. The sprouts were cooked just right.   I had the beef bourguignon shepherd's pie. Perfect with the nippy weather. Mashed potatoes of course were piped on top. You could taste some wine the sauce which really makes a difference--in a good way. Meat was tender enough. One friend had the chicken and dumplings which had a nice flavor. I'd go back to try that. My other friend had tender short rib with a red wine reduction. It was excellent--texture, taste of the reduction. Hope to go back to try that as my entree. My friend got a side of mac n'cheese with pancetta/bacon. It was decent. They don't use very sharp cheese for those that prefer cheddar. It wasn't quite as good as Bliss/Rebar mac n'cheese.   As for dessert, we had that picked out before the appetizers. Chocolate-dipped bacon 'smores were the crowning touch. Marshmallows were toasty and gooey. It came with some whipped peanut butter that was heaven with the graham cracker and marshmallow. The bacon and chocolate was really good together. Though the bacon was a little too salty. There were a few bites where I somehow tasted more bacon than chocolate and the saltiness was a bit overpowering. But everything together was just scrumptious. A woman at a table nearby was staring in awe. We told her it's a must to get.   Definitely happy to expand my restaurant radar. I feel like the last few times I've gone to eat, it's always been a FOX restaurant or something in the Ticoz-Fez-Switch trifecta. Glad to branch out!",

The appetizers are fantastic and staffs were very information and services are very good. They never leave you glass empty, even for water   Had the grilled cheese and meatball for appetizers ... those are AWESOME !!! Good way to start a meal.. (these are where my 3 stars come from)  the menu is pretty small, probably have only 10 items on it... With the fantastic start, the main dishes came out a bit disappointing. I ordered the pork stews which is good and flavorful ... but the taste is so strong that toward half of the dishes I can't keep on eating it ...  Tried the fishes from my friends, a bit toward the fishy side. I know expecting fresh fish in the desert may be a bit much to ask for ... but then at least season it more to get rid of the fish taste ....  And warning... stay away from the chicken & dumpling. It has no taste to it at all ... my friend hated it.     Overall, we still had a good time .. and may go back there for appetizers, but dinner no thank you",

    "text": "Yelp sent me a note that I have eaten at Beckett's a few times and had neglected to write a review.  I am surprised, since I have been to Beckett's multiple times, and I have pretty much wanted to Yelp about this place literally as I was eating the chocolate-covered bacon S'mores for the first time... which was when the restaurant opened over a year ago.  ......So it's pretty obvious what my favorite (espcially for uniqueness and flavor) food item is at Beckett's.  But I have to say that the ribs are ridiculous as well.  I try to order other things, but I always go back to the ribs.  However, I have tried the chicken and dumplings and the pan-seared chicken too, and I have loved both.  There are only two items I haven't loved on the menu and that is the mac-n-cheese-- I think the cheese is a little runny-- and the cheddar biscuits.  They are very bland to me.  Other good things about Beckett's: 1.  The cocktails. 2.  The ambiance (it really is warm and inviting).  Personally, I love the decor a lot. 3.  The service.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely personable.  They are always happy to give a recommendation, and they never seem rushed to get to another table, even when it's busy. 4.  The location and parking.  Relatively centrally located, not off a major freeway, ample parking.  **Speaking of service, I want to mention a situation that happened between me and Beckett's Table this summer.  I had reservations for a Friday night dinner, and I received a call from Beckett's on that Friday that their electricity had gone out, so they had to close down for the day.  (In fact, the electricity had gone out for all the businesses in a 2-block radius that day.)  The manager then offered to squeeze us in either the following day (a busy Saturday) or any time later in the week... at 50% off our total bill!  Not only did this display exemplary customer service, but I was even more impressed that Beckett's provided this service when the electricity problem was definitely not through any fault of their own.  If I could assign the perfect rating to Beckett's, it would be 4.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't have that option.  I usually only reserve 5 stars for \"True\" perfection... which I have given to only 4 restaurants in Arizona throughout my Yelp career. ;)   However, the customer service (which is really a huge part about eating out in the first place) kicked Beckett's up to a 5-star rating.  Just go there.  Just do it.  Take friends from out of town.  Order an awesome old-timey cocktail.  Sit outside by the unique and cool fireplace.  Eat the S'mores until your stomach is going to explode... and then go home happy.  :)",

    "text": "for everyone who says this place is amazing, they must be blind to True culinary technique.  ok so first thing I noticed was the drab wait staff.  very boring and didn't even sound excited to be at work.  on another note, the menu is written well but the food did not deliver.  i wanted to try the fried deviled eggs, and they were clearly warmed up in the microwave and dry. the homemade spicy aioli, was nothing more than sriracha and mayo.  i understand what aioli, but is wasn't mixed well or something. then, i noticed how sloppy everything was plated. no attention to detail!  the knife cuts were terrible and sloppy.  definitely can tell there is not a True chef in the kitchen, rather some cooks.  the shepherds pie was a farce, (don't expect to get full)  lets not get ahead of our self, it was beef stew with a stack of mashed potatoes on top.  also, the shrimp and sausage and grits, again, was tomatoes and shrimp with a side ot butter and heavy cream added to grits.    the bacon smore dessert was plated terribly, looked messy, and unappetizing... keep in mind, it sounded delicious... but at the end of the day, the food was either cold and reheated, burnt from being reheated, or taken out of the freezer and sloppily plated. you can tell nothing is truly made to order.  do not take a date her to impress them.  that is all  ps. im getting some rather insulting comments, let's keep it professional, this is my opinion. nothing else.",

    "text": "We've been hearing about Beckett's for a while now and finally made it out to give it a try. So glad we did, it was really great. The restaurant is really beautiful inside. I love open spaces and open kitchens, and the bar, wood beams, and small touches like the sliding bathroom doors really make me happy. They even have a large community table that seats 16 which I really think fosters a great atmosphere of communal dining. There is nothing better than walking into a restaurant for the first time and just knowing you're going to love the food because the ambiance is so good. That is how you feel when you walk in here.  We started with a bottle of wine and the sausage meatballs. OMG they were amazing. Probably one of my favorite appetizers anywhere. I am literally thinking of just ordering 3 for dinner next time I'm there. My wife and I shared the chicken and dumplings and a side of mac and cheese for dinner. Great flavor, dumplings were perfect, I would have liked to see a little more chicken in the entree though. Mac and cheese was yummy, could have been a little warmer imo.   For dessert, we shared the smores which everyone raves about. We both agreed, the whipped peanut butter was to die for, the graham crackers were good, the marshmallows were amazing....but we just didn't like the chocolate covered bacon. I LOVE chocolate. And I LOVE bacon. In and on everything. But the combination just didn't do it for us. Once the chocolate taste wore off the bacon just didn't taste good.  Oh well, we'll have to have the Death By Chocolate next time :)",

    "text": "For an establishment to present itself as \"high end\" and charge accordingly you would think to receive the best service. I'm honestly amazed at the great service reviews, our server was absolutely horrible and rude. Mind you it was slow last night when we went, it was a birthday celebration and we had about 14 easy going guests. Our server was smug and rude. She looked annoyed with us each time we told her we were not ready to eat and we were fine for the time being. (She kept asking us to order about every 2minutes and we were waiting on a few guests, so we were having $12 a glass wine, chill out) I was unimpressed with her from the get go, she only made it worse by telling a friend and I we couldn't go on the patio because its for \"show\" not really open after she followed us out and asked \"so whatcha doing?\". So obviously we decided to go out the front and have a cigarette which she advised us we would need to take at the end of the establishment complex (more then 50ft away) because quote \"that nasty smoke will bother other guests\" I'm sorry are we children? Do we need to be talked too that way? We know smoking is gross and we didn't come for a fucking lecture. Another friend of ours who showed up later came in with his girlfriend and the manager immediately stopped them to confiscate her water bottle. Really? A polite can you leave that in your vehicle would have sufficed. Between the server and the manager our friend was equally pissed so instead of him dropping a good amount of money on dinner and drinks they left after one drink. Which I did the same as most of party. My further upset was that one of the few girls who did order the same time as a few of the others didn't get her food until an hour later. Our server advised us that she put it in and it'll be out soon. Um no. You forgot don't lie. So if you want to over spend on half assed service and over priced mediocre food come here. If not might I suggest a lovely comparable restaurant in the south chandler area called earnest!",

While I don't typically write reviews after one experience, I feel confident that my ensuing engagements here will be just a pleasant, flavorful, and fulfilling as my sole dining venture.  The setting is lovely, with a generous amount of patio space in addition to the nice layout inside. The community table is a fun spot to sit and cozy up to strangers, eavesdrop or tune others out and enjoy your own company. The waitstaff was nice - nothing out of the ordinary to add there. Though our waiter possibly needs some practice in socializing smoothly with others, I'm tolerant.   The food: very nice. I was not thrown off my chair by any crazy and spectacular flavors, but I really liked what I tasted. The portions were small, which I like because I'm small yet prone to finishing my plate regardless of size. The zucchini pancakes were my favorite, but I'm all about cakes no matter what's in em. The house wine was delicious and oh-so-well priced. Will be back for more, of this I'm sure.",

First I saw an old friend behind the bar, shout out to Keith! He was awesome, talked us through the menu, pointed out of of his favorites and even gave us a full tutorial of how the chocolate covered bacon s'mores should be eaten.   I love the rustic open community style of the place. The kitchen is open so you can check out what is going on, the bar is inviting, the food was great, awesome wine selection and fantastically prices as well. We started with a bottle of the PurVine Cab (BTW the bottle was only $17!!score!) and loved it, then we had the Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup, it was better than could have been expected. The sammy was on cheesy facoccia bread with four cheeses inside and panchetta and came with a small bowl of the roasted tomato soup to dip in, you have to try it!!!   Then there was dessert..... Chocolate Covered Bacon S'mores..... holy cow were they good. I cant really say more than you have to try this culinary adventure, soon!!   We will be back for sure, I hope you love it as much as we did!",

We arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early and found our table ready, with the flowers I had ordered waiting for us. Food was tasty, if a bit uneven (I had some cold veggies on my plate), with the Tuna Tartare appetizer and Pecan and Fig Pie for dessert the stars of the meal (make sure to ask for bread, which was scrumptious!). I was surprised that a Wine Spectator award winner had marginally helpful staff to select wines, though the selection was good and we enjoyed both the glass of Prosecco and bottle of White Burgundy that we enjoyed with dinner. Overall, the experience was very good, if not perfect, and we'll visit again when we're near.",

    "text": "Absolutely Amazing! From start to finish, I was completely blown away by Beckett's Table.  Beckett's Table is a type of restaurant I would expect to find in Beverly Hills or Hollywood, not in the desert city of Phoenix. BT has only been open a month but the owners have done an amazing job making sure this establishment runs like a well oiled machine that has no chinks in its chains. In fact, there is no way I would have known that BT has only been open a month if I was not told by our waiter. The inside of BT is dimly lit and has modern and rustic decor. Even though the place was extremely busy, my fiance and I were able to grab two seats at one of their communal tables near the bar area. Right when we were seated we received complimentary warm wheat and white rolls with super creamy butter. These rolls were fantastic, especially the wheat ones which were really soft and sweet.  BT's menu is made up of classic comfort foods with a twist. My fiance and I started the evening by ordering three appetizers. These are the apps we ordered: Creamy Grits with Spicy Andouille Sausage in a Mustard Au Jus Beckett's Grilled Cheese Sandwiches with Four Cheeses, Pancetta and Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Soup Bacon Cheddar Biscuits with Apple Honey Butter  All three of these apps were delicious. The creamy grits were indeed creamy and contained lots of juicy, semi spicy sausage, tomatoes and grilled onions. The mustard au jus that was on the grits was also extremely flavorful. The little grilled cheese Sammie's were super cheesy and also somewhat salty because of the pancetta. The roasted red pepper soup was also really tasty. The bacon cheddar biscuits were warm, fluffy and had a nice bacon-y flavor.   For dinner I ordered their chicken and dumplings entree while my fiance ordered the fork tender short rib. The chicken and dumplings was served in a big bowl and contained juicy pieces of chicken, soft and squishy dumplings, peas, carrots, celery and an extremely flavorful herb saffron cream sauce. This dish brought back so many memories because as a child my dad used to make chicken and dumplings at least once a month. After him and my mom divorced when I was about 12 or 13, for some reason he never made them again. BT's chicken and dumplings was just as wonderful as the ones I ate as a child. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  The name of my fiances dish perfectly described it. The fork tender short rib really was fork tender. It was also huge and incredibly tasty. The big short rib was placed on a bed of fluffy mashed potatoes, green beans and a wonderful red wine herb reduction sauce.   For dessert I got a slice of their fig and pecan pie with a scoop of citrus zest ice cream and my fiance got their bacon s'mores plate. My fig pecan pie, which won a Phoenix pie contest not long ago, was amazing. It tasted so much different than a normal pecan pie. The figs gave it such a different flavor and texture. The citrus zest ice cream was also unique and tasted wonderful. My fiances bacon s'mores dessert was phenomenal. Forget the s'mores you make while camping, BT's s'mores blow those boring things out of the water. BT's s'mores plate comes with graham crackers, toasted homemade marshmallows, chocolate covered bacon and homemade creamy peanut butter that has caramel sauce drizzled on top of it.  All of these components come on a plate and it is up to you to put it all together in s'more form. It's funny because Scott Stephens (one of the owners) personally came over to us and said that my fiance was the first person he had seen actually take the time and build a s'mores sandwich instead of just eating all the elements with a fork. BT's s'mores are by far the best s'mores I have ever had. They were sweet, salty and crunchy all at the same time.   The service at BT was fantastic. Our server Josh was incredible. He was super friendly, funny and attentive. He talked to us about their menu, gave us suggestions on what to try and what his favorite dishes were and even joked around with us every time he checked up on us. Actually, everyone at BT was extremely friendly and they all seemed to enjoy working at BT.  The prices here were great too. Our entire bill was less than $80 dollars, which I thought was great considering all the food we ordered.   If you're ever in Phoenix then I highly recommend you pay a visit to Beckett's Table. This place is absolutely amazing and I look forward to the day I return to Phoenix so I can eat at BT again.",

    "text": "We were looking for a nicer dinner near our hotel in Phoenix . Yelp brought this one to my attention and everything in the reviews looked good. They looked like they had a fantastic menu and a little bit of that comfort food style that always hits home.   We made reservations on their website, though we likely did not need them for a Thursday. We arrived a bit early and they had no trouble seating us. I think the outdoor seating in an early evening would be great, but we were seated in the back. No problem, it was still early spring. David and his assistant were helping us with our orders and giving us great recommendations. It felt very cozy and the service was excellent from the get go!  The restaurant had a modern yet rustic feel with exposed wood and beautiful details. The bar table as you walk in was gorgeous! Everything in this place looked elegant and yet homey. Great look.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese (because it is almost impossible to pass up), Short ribs and the Osso Buco (which I had been unsure about). Talk about hitting it all spot on. Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. The Osso buco turned out to be the best dish. It was so tender and moist. I would order this again in a second. I was a little less impressed with the short ribs, but they were still good. The mac and cheese was very yummy.  Overall our experience was a total 5. Maybe even higher if allowed. The service felt so personalized and our wait staff really took excellent care of us. They were so helpful and never let the water glasses go down. The answered any questions we had and were patient. They walked by often to check on us, but were never disruptive. Loved it. Every restaurant should be taught this type of service. And, we spent only $45 before tip. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE. All around perfect dining experience!",

    "text": "Another fantastic Yelp find! Beckett's Table was different right away, as soon as my group of eight sat down our waitress told us to relax, take our time, choose carefully and ask all the questions we wanted. You could tell she wanted us to have a great time, she had no desire to rush us and fit in another group, it was refreshing.     Beckett's Table is elegant in a simple way if that makes sense, it's not super dim lighting with expensive leather everywhere, it's lots of wood with an exposed ceiling, but still, the decorations with the big windows and warm color scheme mix perfectly and light the room up.     Appetizers are king here. The entrees are good, and I'll get to them, but they are a shadow compared to the starters. I began with a lovely drink, the classic painkiller #3, a pina colada but better type drink, it is delicious and fruity but started to wear a little towards the end of the glass, very sweet, we also tried flinn's dilemma, kind of a mojito but tasted mostly like lemonade, it was fine. We began chow with the salmon/potato/corn/spinach enchiladas, which are good as long as you like smokey, kind of chipotleish flavors, these are very strong and filling. Also, the cheddar biscuits and mac and cheese with pancetta are on point, both super tasty and good portions for just five bucks. The grilled cheese with tomato soup however is freaking amazing in my mouth. You are seriously missing out if you don't try this cheesy, pancetta packed appetizer.     Entree time. We tried the b burger, which got pretty general \"it's good\" reactions from everyone, but being fair we had recently been to Zinburger and, come on, who can complete with that? The chicken and dumplings were good but there was nothing exceptional about them, I would rather see some kind of a fresh take on a pot pie, there were no complaints, just no raving either. Two people got the green chile pork stew and liked it, but again no shouts of praise and adoration. I asked our waitress to bring me whatever she would order and ended up with the wood fired mussels, a big bowl of big mussels and four fairly large slices of garlic bread. The mussels were good, hard to get out of the shell but meaty and tasty once in your gullet. The broth in the bowl was tasty for bread dipping, but a little too sweet for my tastes, and the bread itself was good with a semi sweet garlic spread on it. Overall a good and hefty meal. We also tried a couple of deserts, the coffee creme brulee was delish but too coffee strong for my buds, the peaches and cream was a hit and the chocolate dipped bacon smores were a little chunk of heaven... big slabs of chocolate covered pig with toasted marshmallows, graham crackers and creamy peanut butter, for only six bucks you HAVE to get this dessert.     With strong service, nice ambiance, great starters, great deserts, good drinks and fair prices, Beckett's Table earns a strong four stars from me even with the somewhat lackluster entrees. If the entrees do pick up sometime soon, or I find one that blows me away, this could easily end up a new favorite restaurant of mine.",

Here are my quick take-a-ways:  -I know you're going to look at the menu and debate appetizers, but just say yes to the mac'n'cheese. It's salty, a little sweet, has a touch of dijon, and is a big plate of creamy goodness.  -Also go with the brussell sprouts. I know you'll be scared. But trust. -Take your time to look at the drink list! Their cocktails are unique and each one has a distinct set of flavors. Try a couple! I liked the AZ Farmhand... hendricks gin, honey syrup, lemonade, ginger & soda. Fresh and not too sweet. -The burger is phenomenal, but I also heard a lot of \"mmmmm\"s about the short ribs from my lovely lady friend sitting next to me. -Absolutely get the sweet potato pie.  -They do serve chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, yes. I was not a fan, but it's something you'll have to try and see how you feel about it. And don't assume you'll like it just 'cause you like bacon and chocolate. Totally different when combined.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I prepared myself to be disappointed after all the yelp hype of this place but fortunately I was not in the slightest. Our server, Allison, was just as friendly as can be and we were treated like maybe we were her best friends and I just forgot.   The restaurant itself is beautiful where the devil is in the details. From an open kitchen to fresh flowers throughout, the decor exceeded my expectations.   I started with their wedge salad with green goddess dressing ($6) and my better half had the roasted red pepper and tomato with sweet corn cream ($6). Although the salad was good, I wished I had have chosen the soup as it was excellent. If you like tomato soup, this would be a good choice.   For our entrees, I ordered the house signature wood fired mussels with shallot white wine & fennel broth ($18) I am a \"originally from Seattle\" food snob and know good seafood. These mussels were fresh and the fennel broth was perfect. The mister ordered the fish of the day, a pan fried cod fillet with fresh veggies (our server said the veg was purchased earlier in the day from the farmers market) and lemon butter sauce ($19). This dish too was a thumbs up.   For desert we ordered the poached pear & blueberry cobbler ($5) served with a ginger snap steusel and house-made honey vanilla ice cream. Yes it is as good as it sounds.   Believe the hype, this place is as good as it gets!",

    "text": "this pains me to write this review--I have been to Beckett's Table several times and have always enjoyed the food, the ambiance and the service, but tonight was different.  I hope that tonite was an anomaly and the next time I go --things will be better.  Met three friends for dinner, two of us ordered from the restaurant week menu and two didn't.  Things started out great-- service started out attentive and stayed that way but for the fact that various servers kept bringing plates to our table that weren't ours--this didn't happen once but three times throughout the meal so things at our table were somewhat chaotic throughout the evening.  now to the food--for my appetizer, I ordered the chicken meatballs--which I quite liked except for the fact that the sauce was very warm (temperature wise) which was good, but the meatballs were cold in the middle which detracted from the flavor of the dish.  So when one of the servers came over--I  told him that I enjoyed the dish but that meatballs were cold and they might want to do something about that for when the serve them the rest of the evening (we were there early) okay so I chalked that up to timing in the kitchen--no big deal.  for my main dish--i ordered the bass which came on some greens--this dish was not advertised as a salad--so I expected the fish to come out warm which it didn't--it was almost cold--there are only certain fish that  taste good cold or not warm and bass in my opinion was not one of them.  so--i let the server know and he picked up my plate and took back to the kitchen--(at Beckett's Table the kitchen is open)--so I as I watch my fish being taken back and the waiter and Chef Beckett discuss it, the chef looked over at me and sneered.   REALLY???  I am the customer--i didn't ask for a substitution or a change in the flavor--I simply wanted the fish not to be cold--as the fish came back to me, I told the server my feelings were hurt that I should not be sneered at for simply asking for the fish be warmer than it was--he made some comments about the fact that it was served on greens--well I have to tell you I had a salmon salad at Kona Grill earlier in the day--and the salmon was warm even though it was on greens.  I like Becktett's Table and have always felt it was very welcoming--but tonite had enough mishaps--that I will think about going back there.  I want to go places where I appreciate the quality of the food and the chef/owner respects that the customers are his livelihood and treat them with some level of respect.",

    "text": "When a restaurant continues to produce such universal praise, we go out of our way to try it.  Thankfully we managed to get to Beckett's Table and it was simply outstanding.  Before I hit the food and drink, I must say that the service was stellar, extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu, perfect timing in table visits, beverages constantly cleared/refilled, and a perfect dose of information and interaction.    We started with the creamy grits and sausage trio and it was heavenly - a perfect blend of textures. We also tried the pork terrine (a pate), and the zucchini pancakes.  The pork terrine was rich and I loved the crusty bread, mustard, and vegetables and the overall flavors.  The zucchini pancakes were awesome, and the arugula added just the right touch to the green sauce and the light pancakes.   We enjoyed the lobster ravioli, which was a divine blend of cheese and lobster, with a soft ravioli. We also tried the pork stew and I loved the rich, deep flavor. That may have been my favorite. We also tried the sea bass with fresh organic vegetables. All fantastic meals.   I highly recommend the chocolate dipped bacon smores for dessert. We tried the Death by Chocolate, a scrumptious flourless chocolate cake and it was great. But the real treat are the smores, because they are off-the-charts tasty, and because you haven't had anything like them. It is sort of a deconstructed dish with chocolate covered bacon, freshly made marshmallow, whipped peanut butter, and graham crackers - ridiculously good, and a must-have!  Also, have to mention the very nice touch with a seal pressed into each of the menus. That is brand individualization and using touch as an additional brand interaction to intensify the experience. Very well done all around and you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Beckett's is fantastic!  The vegetable chop salad is a nice blend of fresh local produce that hits the spot every time.  My wife ordered the traditional french onion soup and it was fantastic, even for someone who doesn't particularly care for onions.  The Pork Ossobuco is my favorite and it did not disappoint.  There are few things in life more decadent and tasty than the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores.  I would highly recommend if you are looking for first rate dining for a great price and good service!   BTW--Beckett's is a great place to go if gluten is a problem with numerous gluten free options.",

    "text": "I think Beckett's table is overrated food-wise (though we had great service). The best thing is the grilled cheese starter with red pepper soup for dipping - I give that five stars. The vegetable chopped salad was tasteless and a waste of time (mostly a pile of dry - but fresh - chopped romaine). I ordered the green chili pork stew and it was sugary sweet, which is an insult to green chili pork stew everywhere (and really all stew). I normally accept good chefs' creative takes on dishes, however this just was bizarre and not good. I sent it back and they graciously took it off the bill without question. I ordered the burger which was good (I wouldn't drive there expressly for it), but the fries were disappointing. Other people in my party liked the smoked pork chop. Bacon stuffing was dry and underwhelming, brussel sprouts starter was okay but like another reviewer said, would be more decadent if roasted more. If it weren't for the glowing reviews I perhaps would have had less expectations, but how can a locally celebrated chef serve fries that bad, salad that boring and tasteless, and stew that sweet? I have to give it a \"meh.\"",

    "text": "Beckett's Table is a great combination of laid-back and upscale, with great service and even better food.  This is one of those places where you need to go hungry, because is you skip any course you will be doing yourself a disservice.  We started with the grilled cheese as an appetizer, which sounds very mundane.  Not so.  It comes with pancetta, four different cheeses, and a delectable roasted red pepper tomato soup for your dipping pleasure.  I selected the osso buco for my entree, and I was not disappointed.  I love osso buco and Chef Beckett did right by me.  I went with the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores for desert, and was transported to hog heaven.  I might have to book a stay at the local cardiac unit for after my next visit, but it will be worth it.",

    "text": "I really had high hopes going into our dinner at Beckett's Table. In the end, though, I left quite underwhelmed.   The food, pretty much all of it, is good enough but nothing I will remember tomorrow. My wife had the steamed white bass, the clear winner at the table. The short ribs, pork stew and vegetable plate were all passable, nothing more. The mussels were downright bad and were returned because they both smelled and tasted like they should have been thrown out a few days prior.  We shared three appetizers among the 8 of us and none stood out. So much so I honestly can't remember what one of them was an hour later. Pass on the desserts -- both the coconut cake and the death by chocolate cake were dry and lacked any real flavor.  Perhaps the oddest part of the meal was the service. Our server must have been a politician in a past life -- no real answers to any questions asked. If you ask which entree is better, A or B, you get a dissertation about how each is prepared and the fact that salmon has good Omega-3's. Not really what we were looking for. When we returned the mussels, we were told they were going to be \"retired\" from the menu for the evening, yet we saw no less than 4 orders go out afterward.   The atmosphere of the restaurant itself was great. It seemed friendly and casual and is appropriate for families. The patio is nice and large with a great fireplace. I also liked the open kitchen. Unfortunately those attributes do not make up for so-so food and odd service, so we'll likely only return if we get a craving for white bass.",

Mac 'n cheese was given a tangy, mustard seed Welsh rarebit twist, and I loved it. The veggie chop salad had a ton of variety and flavor. Chocolate bacon s'mores were so good, the table next to us ordered round after round of it.  Service was impeccable. Friendly, fast, and super-knowledgeable, and our server made us feel so welcome.   Atmosphere is upscale casual, but not remotely pretentious. Very lively and friendly, with a diverse crowd.    The wine list was exceptional, but the beer options were disappointing.   Do call ahead to make reservations; We called a half hour before we wanted to arrive and were seated immediately, while walk-ins waited for forty-five minutes.",

    "text": "Location: First off, my guest and I (we drove separately) had a little difficulty finding this place. I am not sure if this was because the sign was not lit up or what. But, they are just 2 weeks old and maybe that hasn't been done or something. Just we aware that the sign might not be lit up when you go.  Venue: It is actually kind of neat inside. There didn't seem to be any \"prime tables\" as all the tables were pretty much just 4-tops. Also, not a lot of seclusion if you are looking for that. About 40% of the venue is a bar, but isn't separated from the restaurant. Real sleek, suave bar. The kitchen is open. So, if the cook is spitting in your food then you will probably see them. I kind of liked having the open kitchen in a small venue.  Food: I had the Green Chili Stew with macaroni and cheese. Go ahead, laugh at my mac & cheese. The green chili was a touch spicy but then again, I am a total spice sissy. Even with that said, it *was* good. I ate it all.   The mac and cheese was a different story. I jokingly ordered that right off the bat and our server raved about it. Said he loved it. My guest also ordered it. Without a doubt, the mac and cheese was awesome. Really, I think it was better than my green chili stew.  Cost: It cost us $48 for two people. This was with 2 mains, 2 sides, an iced-tea, and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.  Bottom Line: I see this place succeeding... especially if people can find it with their light off outside.",

    "text": "So while perusing Beckett's Table FB post, I had noticed their menu and decided to check it out. After looking over it with a fine tooth comb, I realized their Brussel Sprout dish was missing. I immediately commented about it on FB and said how sad I was that it was no longer a menu option. Fast forward a few days later and they posted They're BACK!!!! Woohoo!!! I was so excited. I mean me, excited over Brussel Sprouts. Yes indeed!!!   Fast forward to last night, after the Yelp Help's event. I figured since I was in the neighborhood, I might as well stop on over to have my fill.  I got there, scored a fabulous parking spot, and propped my booty up at the bar. Before he could even ask what I wanted to drink I blurted out Brussel Sprouts. Poor guy. I knew he wanted to laugh but instead he was like ok.. I will get that in for you but would you like something to drink? I giggled and declined since I had been to a wine making event before the Yelp Event (busy night)  Fast forward what seemed like 5 mins and bam, my brussel sprouts were in front of me. The waiter that served them to me even asked if I had called them in because they were ready so fast. I said nah, but maybe someone in the back heard me when I blurted out Brussel Sprouts? lol. OMG they were so delicious. Crispy pancetta, little crispy burnt (in a good way) brussel sprouts. I was in vegetable heaven.  I chatted it up with another bar patron, paid my bill and was out the door in maybe 30 mins flat. I really did just come in for some yummy Brussel Sprouts. What can you say, its an addiction! I will definitely  be back again as long as they are on the menu :)",

    "text": "The short: Solidly A-OK. A beautiful restaurant with top-notch service, but food was hit-or-miss, especially for the prices charged.  The long: I drive by Beckett's Table during my daily commute and have been looking forward to trying it for over a year. On a whim, we finally stopped in early on a Saturday night to see if we could get a table, and we were able to.  Beckett's Table is beautiful--a large, open space that's modern without looking harsh or posh, filled with wood and stonework without being cold or harsh, well-lit without being blaring. Even though it was a Saturday night and we didn't have reservations, we were promptly seated on the patio that, even in the middle of December, was heated to a comfortable temperature that allowed us to remove our coats. The tables soaked in gentle amounts of heat so they were nice and warm when we sat down. Our server and her assistant were awesome, keeping our water glasses filled and our iced tea fresh, moving quickly and unobtrusively through the entire meal.  We started with the complimentary table bread--two brown rolls (sweet rye?) and one cheddar-topped biscuit for the two of us to split--along with a dish of soft, tasty butter. My boyfriend started with beckett's original grilled cheese, featuring pancetta, four cheeses, and a little bowl of roasted red pepper tomato soup. It was decadent and heart-stopping and a generous and tasty first course, and probably my favorite dish of the night even though it was a very homey dish--I love homey dishes, but I tend to cook those at home to save myself some bucks since they're usually pretty easy and cost-efficient to make at home. I had the super creamy grits & schreiner's sausage trio. The grits were indeed creamy, perfectly cooked, but underseasoned. I usually don't have to salt my food, I had to this time because the tasty sausage or peppery arugala topping the dish couldn't carry the load.  For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the pork osso buco confit and I ordered the much-hyped fork tender short ribs. The spaezle that accompanied his osso bucco was fine, and his osso bucco had good flavor and texture, but it was dry. Unfortunately, that was also the theme with my short ribs. They were indeed fork tender, thrillingly so, but with my first bite, I knew they weren't moist and buttery. The mashed potatoes were, as expected, fine, as were the green beans, although they were too firm for my taste, and I had to wrestle a bit with them. All this may sound like I'm looking for baby food, but the truth is that I expect long-braised meats to be tender on the plate, but also melt-in-my-mouth buttery once it's in my mouth. It really is a beautiful sight to see a simple dinner fork swipe right through meat, but once you've had perfectly braised meat, you keep its potential in mind with following dishes. While their flavors were good, our entrees at Bckett's Table just didn't quite fit the bill.  We closed out with the award winning fig & pecan pie served with beckett's original cream cheese citrus zest ice cream, which was an awesome pair--my second-favorite dish of the night with its crumbly tender crust and a beautiful filling that was more fig than pecan, but a perfect balance in my opinion. The ice cream was delicious--soft, sour, and barely sweet--a perfect foil to the sweet pie filling.  Overall, I wasn't blown away by our dishes, but I was pleased enough and intrigued enough by the menu to want to go back when we're in the neighborhood and feeling like spending a little more than usual for dinner.",

That's how I would describe it, thing or not. But I just wasn't as crazy about the food.  My table of four sampled all of the apps on the summer menu, plus sides of cheddar biscuits and veggie spaetzle. Everything was prrrriiiiiity good, but nobody moaned embarrassingly loud with pleasure or fell out of their chair. And ultimately that's what I want. I want to be embarrassed and/or fall out of my chair.  Service was mediocre. We were sat about 30 minutes after our reservation, no biggie when there's good conversation and a wine list. But our server was that weird mix of faux-formal and inexperienced, you know: the kind that shames you for ordering tap water, but then neglects that nobody has utensils when the food arrives.  And he probably didn't realize this, but I refuse to be shamed. After all, I didn't even fall out of my chair.",

We arrived close to 8:00PM on a Friday night. The parking lot was nearly full but we lucklily snagged a space right near the door. We were greeted & since we didn't have a reservation we were told there would be a 15 to 30 minute wait for a table. Alternatively we could eat at the bar of at the long communal table. We opted for the communal table at sat at the end near the kitchen where we could watch what was going on & see the various dishes as they were set out for the servers.  Our friendly waiter described the night's special appetizers & my companion chose an assortment of 6 different types  of cucumbers. I'm not big on cukes so I ordered a bibb salad with red grapes & pecans to get things going. The cucumber appetizer was a knockout in looks & tastes. It was served on an 8\"' by 12\" cutting board with small legs in each corner. There were 8 different types of cukes. There were small, thin, round slices stacked 3-4 high in each corner. The other 7 varieties were artfully arranged toward the center of the board. I appreciated the presentation. My companion appreciated both the presentation & the tastes.  I had white bass for my entree. It was served in a bowl with a tasty, light, tomatoe based sauce with corn & finely chopped peppers. The bass was topped with a large scoop of guacamole with very thin strips of tortilla chips sticking out. My companion had the green chile pork stew & said it tasted terrific.   We will definitly be back for seconds & ...",

The True test for any restaurant in my family is if we take my father there and he does not complain. My second outing to Beckett's Table was with my dad and he did not complain a single time. That my friends is when you know it's good.   I have not been very adventurous during my two times dining here, I ordered the exact same thing each time, with dessert for me always being a toss up.  The Beckett's original grilled cheese with that delicious tomato soup is absolutely amazing. The savory soup coupled with a grown up kid classic is a divine way to start a decadent evening meal. The short ribs were absolutely amazing. They are what carnivore dreams are made of. As if it could not get any better, then there is dessert. And as a person who always looks at a dessert menu first to decide if I want to save room, SAVE ROOM! I have had the chocolate dipped bacon 'smores and the death by chocolate. Both are amazing, but the death by chocolate is by far my favorite. HELLO NUTELLA PUDDING! I swear I still have dreams about it.   I appreciate the GF options, I'm always on the lookout for places that can accommodate my little celiac sis.   One more thing to note: Parking is an absolute nightmare in this lot, I would suggest parking towards the other end of the shopping center and walking up to Beckett's.",

Grits and schriners sausage melted in your mouth.  Service was on point and for an impromptu date night at the bar this really was wonderful.   We will be back often.  Mac and cheese with pancetta for desert is a must!  You will have to share cause its a heaping bowl of goodness!  love love loved it!",

If guy go, ask for David, a 30 year veteran in the restaurant biz who bears none of the wear and tear.   Make sure you don't miss the biscuits, mac n cheese, and deviled eggs!!  All to die for.  I gorged on the appetizers and my friend had the pork osso boco and loved it.  For dessert try the fig pecan pie, just a slice of heaven.  Beautiful place with great ambiance!!",

I had pork stew and it was a bit salty but okay. My friend is vegetarian and she ordered mac n cheese and some side dish. The server recommended grilled vegetable medley (i don't remember the name of the entre and don't even want to check the menu) when we got our check to pay. We had to wave our hands to get attention from the server or other people working at the restaurant to get our water glasses filled. The bottom line is \"cute place with okay food and terrible service\". Oh we had a reservation.haha",

    "text": "Ahhh, here's to the good life, and here's to Beckett's Table, where the good life happens daily.  I was looking for a great place for a first date/birthday celebration, and I was torn between Rokerij and Hillstone. I contacted Gabi, to ask her what her expert opinion would be, and she was kind enough to recommend Beckett's Table (BT), and put me in touch with the manager to get a good reservation (Gabi-you rock!).  Arriving at BT at 7:30, the reservation was there with no problems, and we were seated at a cozy table off to the side. Our server, Josh, was great and explained the specials and got our drink orders. I had the Palmaire, and it was very, very good. So good, that I started thinking that my car might spend the night in Arcadia, while I cab it home.  For dinner, I had the short ribs, and my date had the green chili stew. Thanks to Yelper recommendations, we added the mac&cheese side dish. All the food was outstanding, and my date was awesome, she was beautiful, smart, and funny (in case you were wondering).  I found the prices very reasonable for the portions, and the quality of the food. I am confused by complaints that it is pricey, it is easily less expensive than Houston's, Rokerij, etc. There is a reason this place has so much buzz, and it is well deserved.   The one thing I would suggest as an improvement, would be to do a little something when people make reservations and note a special event. A good example is Durant's when you make a reservation, they always ask if you're celebrating anything, and if you are, Durant's is kind enough to provide a comped dessert of their choosing. Don't get me wrong, I am not dissing BT, just making a suggestion. If you've been to Durant's and experienced it, it really is a nice, classy touch that keeps everyone coming back.  Hopefully I get a second date with this amazing woman, but if not, we'll always have Beckett's Table, and you can bet I will be back.",

    "text": "I got the beef bourgignon shepherd's pie and I was not a fan.  Isn't bourgignon AND shepherd's pie supposed to be more like a stew at the bottom?  It seems like mine was over reduced, I ended up with mash with chunks of meat and a few carrots that tasted like burnt sauce.  The potato topping had 2 whole cubes of potato in it, which I'm thinking weren't supposed to be there.    We also got the mac and cheese with and without pancetta - it was kind of bland.  Not very cheesy, not very much of anything really..    The fork tender spare ribs were tasty but I've had better.  The pork chile stew was actually pretty good but the taste was a bit strong.  It had the same taste as chipotle steak - maybe its cumin?  The corn bread that accompanied was unlike any I've ever had..  it was airy, not dense, but kind of dry at the same time with a crunchy crust - maybe too much butter?  I love corn bread and I did not like what they did to it..  The desert was interesting - we got the bacon smores.  The bacon was way too salty, or maybe it needed a couple more dips in the chocolate to offset it better but the saltiness overpowered anything else.  The quality of the bacon seemed good, maybe they can get a reduced sodium version?  The death by chocolate was good, but it was very chocolatey - I do not recommend it if you don't like fudge dipped in chocolate on chocolate ice cream.  The one thing about the plating..  the lil smear of thick chocolate sauce (mousse?) does not add to the attractiveness whatsoever..  The service was great and I love the decor.  That being said, the portions are small for the pricing and the food is not very good.  Don't try to be fancy if you can't do it well.",

I didn't have a specific taste for anything on this night, but my guy really wanted chicken and dumplings and had heard good things about them here. We started with an order of zucchini cakes and he had the roasted red pepper tomato soup. I had one of the cakes and must say it was one instance where I didn't mind that I was eating zucchini.  I didn't try the soup, but he cleaned the bowl, so it must've been good! For dinner I ended up with a chopped salad as I didn't want anything as heavy as stew or dumplings. It was yummmmy! The champagne vinaigrette was so bright, it was literally like sunshine in my mouth; loved it!  It was a great portion and I finished all my veggies... Mom would be so proud.  =) They have a number of gluten free and vegetarian items, so it would be a good spot if you're looking for those options. They also have a really nice wine, beer and scotch list with really good prices... Prices were pretty good on everything. We had 2 beers, 1 scotch, soup, app and 2 dinners for $80 with generous tip.  I must also add the server was effective and pleasant. I gave it 3 stars because I wasn't outta my mind impressed, but it was good and I would definitely go back. I'm sure the menu will have changed, so maybe I will have to up my stars next visit!",

    "text": "The service was excellent from the moment I walked in. My family told me the wrong time for our reservation (6pm when the reservation was really at 6:30pm) so I was a bit early on a Tuesday night dinner for 6. The server who would be taking care of our table suggested I have a glass of wine at the bar, and he told me about the AZ wines that I wanted to try and was very courteous and fast.   Another couple nearby ordered drinks and the man in the couple went to the restroom. Before he could return, his drink had been ready and the female said, \"Talk about service!\" in recognition of the speedy and friendly service.  I asked the bartender about several dishes on the menu and he had plenty to share about all of them. Then my party arrived and we sat down. One of the bus boys noticed that one of our tables was slightly uneven and wobbly (not enough that I would have said anything) and he immediately returned with a wedge to fix it. The waiter was extremely friendly. Water and wine service was exemplary. Food came at the right moment after appetizers. Regular table bread was delicious.   They also have a local farm that grows ingredients just for the restaurant. We ordered the special salad from the farm that the chef had picked out the day before and it was perfect. We got the bacon cheddar biscuits and of course they were incredible.   I ordered the green chile pork stew with cornbread after fretting about all the delicious things I wanted to eat on the menu and was SO pleased. I am a very picky, finicky, child-like palette eater so for me to branch out and order a pork dish when normally I don't prefer meat at all was a big deal. I can't wait to go back and eat it again. It was soooo amazing. My fiance had the burger and said it was good but not blown-away good. Everyone else was happy. Another member of our party ordered the pork obusco or whatever it's called and the meat was falling off the bone tender. It literally did fall off the bone.   I had low expectations because I thought by the atmosphere that this would be one of those \"trendy looks but weak food\" places like Noca (ugh) but it's not.  I am literally salivating to go back!",

This is very important as I have recently been experiencing a rash of horrible customer serive so is was such a treat to really be taken care of by the entire staff.   Rebecca was our waitress and we explained that my husband has a food allergy (honey) and she told us right away everything to avoid (turns out the lemonade has honey in it- who knew?) So she was helpful and lifesaving!  I ordered like I was a 5 years old and had the roasted pepper tomato soup and the mac and cheese with pancetta. Ok, perhaps not many 5 years olds would order panchetta but it said to right in the menu (really it does!). It was yummy and I literally wanted to lick the plate of mac and cheese the sauce was so good. My husband has the burger and complimented the very fresh ingredients.  I had to- absolutley had to- have the chocolate covered bacon s'mores. It was deeeelish! Honestly I thought the best part was the whipped peanut butter - the bacon was a great salty/sweet touch but it was the pb that did it for me.   With so many of the dishes containing honey I don't know that this will be a reg spot for us but we very much liked and appreciated our visit and have to say- job well done!!",

The \"white Bread\" is actually an asiago roll roll with a crunchy top.  We then moved on to the Gazpacho which was a perfect blend of coolness and hidden heat. It was a wonderful teaser for all the other flavors to come. The specials looked incredible, but we have some fellow foodies that raved about the Mussels and the Short Ribs. The mussels had a sweetness that I have never experienced with Mussels. It was star anise and while it was a bit perplexing it kept me coming back for more. My wife and I were supposed to share, but she really didn't want to share her Mussels.  The short ribs were wonderfully flavorful and perfectly cooked. Normally in a restaurant you often experience a great main dish with some weak accompaniments. This was not the case. The mashed potatoes, sauce and beans were exquisite.  The ambiance, service and vibe were topped of the experience. We didn't bring our daughter with us, but we were very impressed with the kids menu. We will bring her next time. This will be our new regular hang out.",

The Kief-Joshua Red blend was terrific with both our entrees.  DH had the green chile stew and I had the short ribs.  My ribs, green beens, mashed potatoes and sauce were all perfectly done!  the short ribs were easily cut with my fork and my green beans were cooked with perfect balance without being insipidly limp.

So, I went to a happy place when I found them roasted with Parmesan, smiling at me from the appetizer section at Beckett's. The sprouts and their appetizer buddies really stole the show that night. I also had the Matzo ball soup and a vegetarian tower as my main entree, but those two items did not compare to the sprouts and butternut squash enchiladas that started the evening. The mac n cheese was a little fancy and perhaps not quite as cheesy as your dreamiest creation, but it also hit all the right notes of delicious.   Strong start, including some creative cocktails and quality beer selection, a little intermission, but then, there was the grand finale. The desserts were perfect, not too sweet and warm in all the right places. My personal favorite was the fig and pecan pie. I may have to order one of those to be FedEx'd for Thanksgiving.",

I had very high expectations based off everyone's reviews and sadly was really underwhelmed.   The atmosphere is very nice and the wait staff was very attentive. But majority of the food was totally disappointing. We started with the 'famous' grits and sausage with mustard which was good - but not spectacular. I ordered the oysters and my BF got the grilled cheese and tomato soup. My oysters were mushy which is just really unappealing when you are eating seafood and tasted overly fishy. I barely ate half of the dish. The grilled cheese and soup was good, but again, nothing you couldn't get anywhere else. For dessert we were drawn to the chocolate covered bacon s'mores, which we agreed, were the best part of our experience. The dessert was delicious and unique.   Overall we left feeling perhaps we'd give Beckett's Table a second chance on another occasion but considering the price it won't be at the top of our list. I will absolutely commend the staff as they were wonderful, I just wish the food had been better.",

As our large group walked in, we were warmly greeted by the staff and seated at an accommodating table in the back. I noticed how homey the atmosphere was with the low lightening, the open kitchen and the wooden and brick architecture. Although the restaurant is situated in a random strip mall in Arcadia, you would never know once you get situated inside.   We started with cocktails and I went for the Palmaire. Tasty!! It had pomegranate infused vodka/juice of some sorts and the soda added a perfect blend to it.   So now moving on to the food.   Order everything on the menu, or as much as you can handle for the size of your group because everything I tasted was delicious. The enchiladas have a zing to them, the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness, the Brussels sprouts are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetable dish has the right amount and style of veggies to make you want more.   Now that I was nearly stuffed from the appetizers alone, I moved to the entree. Although I was full and could have (should have) gone with a lighter option, I heard such amazing things about the short ribs that I had to give it a go. Yes, it was worth every bite and more. The shorts ribs were so tender, the meat fell into my fork and the potatoes and green beans were the perfect compliment.   To end the meal marathon, the group tasted all the desserts on the menu. Yes all of them. Each one was good in its own way, but my favorite was the chocolate souffle cake. What can I say, I'm a chocoholic.   In summary, this is a great dining option for dinner with your sweetie or with a huge group. You'll leave full from a great meal within a comforting atmosphere.  Let me also might add...they are only open for dinner and get there early because there will be a wait.",

    "text": "Just moved to Phoenix from Denver and was very excited to try Beckett's Table and get a feel for the restaurants here. After two weeks going to several places, I'm even more pleased about the meals we got at Beckett's! We've had some really disappointing experiences and keep comparing what we got for our money at Beckett's. For example we ate at Spoke & Wheel the night before, it was only $20 less (for our two meals together) and was shit ingredients.  I ordered the Tenderbelly pork chop since I used to live in the same neighborhood as Tenderbelly and miss them already. It was cooked perfectly - moist, a little pink, great flavour, I was very happy with it. The sides were great and I got a flight of rose that came with some info on each wine and really enjoyed that.  We had really great service and my boyfriend enjoyed his meal, though he was disappointed some things like octopus and sweetbreads had come off the menu since his last visit (he traveled here once in a while and would make a point to eat here). Now that we've eaten elsewhere, we get it - I don't think a ton of people in Phoenix are very adventurous with their food. We hope that changes and they can put some of these offerings back on the menu.  It was also strangely quiet during dinnertime, many open tables, in Denver this place would be full with reservations for sure. I hope the monsoon rain storm that night was the reason and they are doing good, because we would like to keep coming back here. They not only have very high quality ingredients but they obviously care about food, have reasonable prices and great service.  EDIT: they have a lot of gluten-free options, we even did the bacon s'mores gluten-free (sans graham crackers) and they were amazing. I'm celiac and appreciate being able to eat somewhere and know I won't get sick.",

Environment- The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous; when we were there I remember seeing beautiful fresh flowers in vases everywhere. I loved that. Because it was a nice time of year we sat outside, where there was a beautiful brick fire place.   Service- From what I remember our server was great and our food came out in a timely manner.   Food- My boyfriend and I still talk about the fried pork cheek and ham hock...DELICIOUS. I also got macaroni and cheese with bacon for an appetizer...cheese heaven. Our entrees were just as amazing, my bf had the short ribs and I had the Osso Buco, which I highly recommend. We ended our dining experience with chocolate covered bacon peanut butter s'mores, as well as pecan pie.  I wish I had reviewed this place earlier so I could have been more detailed BUT I did take pictures of everything so check those out.   Price-  $94.22 before tip for 2 appetizers, 2 drinks (mixed and beer), 2 entrees, and 2 deserts   Overall-  Will definitely return!",

    "text": "Decided to make reservations for x4 on a Saturday night to try something new w/ family visiting from out of state. Upon walking in, the exposed rafters and rustic yet contemporary feel made this native Arizonan feel right at home. Beckets did a phenomenol job w/ the atmosphere-- pleasant unintrusive  music in the background with a din comfortable for dinner conversation. Tables were nicely spaced apart-- not overly crowded. Our server was fine and the Iced Tea delicious. We ordered the Brussel sprouts-- the portion really only  shareable between x2 people was underwhelming. They were poorly cooked-- still raw and could not be cut with a butter knife. We were forced to fork then gnaw. It seemed that they doused raw Brussels sprouts in vinegar, par baked bacon and threw them straight under a broiler. There were slimy pieces of bacon under the Brussel sprouts w/ a couple of pieces (I think bacon) that were burnt to the extent of  being unrecognizable on the top. No one went back for a second bite.    We had some dinner rolls (menu:\"requested bread\") that were not notable and ordered the cheddar/bacon biscuits. THESE WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD. The best drop biscuits I've had anywhere.  For entrees I had the pei mussels w/ salami, saffron rice and tomatoes. While a healthy portion, these were unacceptable. There was no salami, the tomatoes tasted like a tired jarred tomato sauce, the saffron undetectable and after counting x5 unopened mussels in the dish I was nervous to continue as I lost confidence that the cook understood how to serve them safely/appropriately. My server did not come by to check on us re: entrees and someone else came to swiftly clear our plates. My friends/family had the cheeseburger (thin patties x2 not cooked to order), short rib (tried a bite, good flavor but slightly tough and dry), and the chicken skillet (per husband, super greasy).   Given our great luck with the biscuits and being still hungry, as only one of us actually ate their entree, we shared the pecan/fig pie ala mode. The pie was balanced, not overly sweet and my friend was in LOVE with the ice cream.   I thought about possibly x2 stars given that there were a couple top notes to this dining experience.... but ultimately I had x2 dishes that were inedible. Given Beckets reputation and the other glowing reviews I found this dining experience to be incredibly disappointing. We didn't feel comfortable letting our friends/family split the bill as we felt responsible for deciding to come here. Given the rest of the largely positive reviews, maybe we caught them on a really bad night?",

    "text": "Had dinner at Beckett's as part of a professional meeting. The restaurant had been advised in advance that the party had a vegan, a vegetarian, and a pork-free member.   We were on the patio, which was small and narrow for the pre-dinner gathering. It was breezy and cold unless standing right under the heaters, at which point it was then too warm. The circular dancing of 25 people trying to accommodate the temperature could have been interesting.  We all moved back and forth to accommodate the door from restaurant being opened by the waitstaff....  Appetizers were brought. All of them contained either dairy or dairy&pork. The egg of the day was a \"cheeseburger\"-- which was an very overly salted deviled egg with some dribbles of beef and a sliver of american cheese.  When asked how we liked it a group of 7 people all agreed it was over salted. There was no response from the waiter. A 3-cheese popover had pancetta. When asked if there were vegan options the answer was \"not for appetizer\". We were able to get some popovers without the pancetta but not without asking for it specifically.   Once at the table, it became clear that the (1) restaurant was poorly equipped to handle vegetarian and vegan diets and (2) the waiter (at our table) didn't feel like working to make the experience a positive one.  Initially, the waiter brought a cauliflower dish to the table -- veg, right? --- nope: the cauliflower had chicharron sprinkles throughout.  Instead of another meated salad, he then brought a plate of iceberg lettuce with some carrot shavings and balsamic. It reminded me of salad in the late 60's -- when iceberg without imagination was what salad meant.  For the main meal: The vegetarian/vegan option was the same: a plate of boiled.  Carrots, onion and baked apples on a plate. I'm not kidding. When asked if there was a starch or something filling to go with it, the answer was (in so many words) no. When asked if a side of vegan mashed potatoes was a possibility the waiter said \"no, they have dairy and they come that way\" (what preparation happens in the Beckett's kitchen I then ask myself)  At our table there were 2 who selected meat in their entree. The green chili pork stew came in a lovely little skillet. The pork cubes were tough. The sauce was an unbalanced mix of kernels of sweet corn (what's that doing in green chili stew?) and hot green chili.  Another person selected the salmon, which in a future/past life must have been a shaker shingle.  Dessert was hilarious. Desserts are easy. Desserts are vegetarian usually, vegan sometimes. Not at Beckett's. Dessert was an apple crisp with bacon. Other milk-containing sweets were served as well -- something the vegetarian could eat. Not the vegan. When asked (again!) if there was a vegan option, the waiter offered to bring some fresh orange slices for the vegan (see 1960's comment above). It almost seemed as if he thought that if the vegan were hungry enough she'd give up those nasty vegan habits. Or, more likely, he wasn't thinking about it and didn't care. We certainly didn't see any proactive exhibits of a desire to \"serve\" or to make the experience a positive one.   Other observations: 1 the bathrooms were clean 2 the kitchen is open so those there for the show could be happy 3 the tables inside looked fine; at the bar a nice wood/metal combination 4 the bar: the rye manhattan on the rocks was truly great                 there isn't an IPA on tap and some of the wines were super iffy  5 the indoor decibels were moderate /  high  Summary:  1) If you check the \"I go out for the ambience\" box, this wouldn't be a bad place to go. Sit inside if it's cold outside. Don't expect the waitstaff to be accommodating or learn to anticipate your needs as the night progresses.                                   (If I were you I'd have given the place 3 stars)  If you go to a restaurant for the food, drive on by.                                 (If I were you, I'd have given the place one star)",

The waitress, when I asked about the deviled eggs appetizer, was rude and just continued acting that way the entire night. No surprise here because of how lax our waitress was, but our appetizer went to the wrong table, and the manager apologized, which was the only redeeming thing about the experience, sadly. But then our entrees took a really long time and were subpar at best. Short ribs were overcooked and seasoned poorly and the combo of everything on the plate just didn't make for a great bite. Too heavy. Wife said scallops had an odd smell and taste and were too earthy. Fried potatoes and chorizo with scallops? Not the best complement. Again, too heavy. I wouldn't go back here.",

We had the creamy grits with sausage and shrimp which they gladly separated out a portion of for my partner who is deathly allergic to shrimp. The bacon and cheese biscuits with apple butter are reason enough to come back to Phoenix! The petite chicken was excellent (the bacon cheese biscuit stuffing certainly helped!). Pan seared scallops were perfectly done and tender.  Ditto the cod. For dessert we had to try the house specialty s'mores - chocolate covered bacon, house made marshmallow and peanut butter mousse on a graham cracker cookie. I know - I was doubtful too but it works!  Be sure to assemble it rather than eat the pieces separately. We also had fig and pecan pie with cream cheese citrus ice cream.  The pie was fine but the ice cream was amazing.  I know bacon is trendy and overdone but trust me this place makes it work!!",

Think cheesy crispy brioche bun with four layers of cheese oozing out the sides, and an incredibly crisp pancetta bacon for a delightful play on the senses. Served with a creamy roasted red pepper soup, its perfect for dipping and ends up tasting like a divinely inspired pizza or calzone with these two items combined. Enjoy it for only $6 during social hour, along with grits and sausage, or oven roasted brussel sprouts with a caramelized onion dressing and pancetta.  Also on the happy hour and a half menu are $7 signature cocktails such as the New Orleans famed \"Miss Katie's Pimm's Cup\" or the \"Grand Mimosa\" with grand marnier and brut bubbles.  Select Wines and drafts for $4 and $5.  Sitting at the bar and ordering is perfect, food is delivered exceptionally fast - and hot and fresh to boot.",

    "text": "A year ago we came here and it was really good. We had the short ribs and the fish and both dishes were great. Tonight we decided to come back and this time it didn't go so well. We decided to both get the burger which came with fries. They were very greasy and no joke, tasted like a double quarter pounder from Mcdonalds. It tasted so much like McDonald's that right when I was about to tell my boyfriend he beat me to it and said, \"This tastes like McDonald's!\" It had two beef patties that appeared to be previously frozen just based on their distinct curved shape and spongy texture. Also the fact that we were told our burgers would be cooked well done supports my frozen theory. A gourmet restaurant not allowing you to cook your burger to order? Hmm... Also the pickles were the same exact dill pickles like McDonald's but in the sandwich slice size. The cheese was that same square, plastic, non-melting, yellow cheese. Both burgers were smothered in mustard too. Oh! And get this! The fries were exactly like McDonald's but had extra batter on them. I'm not even kidding, check out my pictures. We weren't sure if the chef was going for a gourmet McDonald's burger or if he was resentful of people ordering the cheapest entree because the food is very overpriced here. I would have paid a little extra to have an original gourmet burger with fresh ingredients than to pay less and leave what's supposed to be a nice restaurant, feeling oogy. We both feel like we just chowed down on some fast food. You know that heavy, bloated feeling where you regret eating greasy food and now feel you owe your body some water and vegetables? The kind where you need tums to feel better? Yeah that's us tonight. I'm sure we'd try this place again but only if we have the cash to spend to get their lighter but more expensive dishes. FYI, this rating is solely based on the particular meal we had tonight. I'm not trashing on the restaurant but they should trash their burger recipe. ...Unless you happen to love McDonald's, then you'll love this!",

    "text": "We went during Restaurant week and had to try the menu of course. We had reservations so we didn't have to wait, and the place was packed and upbeat. I wasn't thrilled with the seating arrangements against the wall, as the tables were lined up so close to each other you could hear your neighbors conversation so no intimate talk. Our waiter didn't really interact with us or make us feel welcome and seemed more into wanting to turn the table quickly which greatly turned me off. You have to ask for bread as they don't offer it which the couple next to us commented on, also telling us they were still hungry after their full meal. Neither us of left hungry, so I can't complain about that.  I was more impressed with my meal then hubby was with his own. I went with the French onion soup which was very good, shepherds pie which I found to be excellent and a good size and would highly recommend. Fudge for dessert which was also very good, though a strange dessert to have on the menu. Hubby had the grits and sausage which he felt was on the watery side, pulled pork as his entree which also fell short of his expectations, and the cheese plate for dessert. He was clearly unimpressed and the parking situation outside is very difficult.  At least we can say we tried it and had a good, if not great, experience.",

It has such a plain exterior that I wasn't expecting it to be so cute and quaint inside. We sat at the bar and shared a burger. It was fantastic!  Super juicy and favorable and the homemade picked added just the right amount of crunch. We also had the deviled egg of the day and loved it.  What a great neighborhood location!  We will definitely be back!",

If you are looking for a solid dinner out, this is a great option, I enjoyed my meal.   First I really liked the way the completely revamped the interior from it's previous tenant \"That's Italiano\". Its very open and warm (not temperature wise).  We started with the Grits and sausage, which were great, smokey and creamy, great combination.   For entrees I selected the vegetable chop salad, which really intrigued me with the pumpkin seed brittle. It was OK, I really wanted it to be better, and it wasn't bad, just a little lackluster. I also had a side of roasted vegetables, which were very heavy on the smoke flavor. My husband had the short ribs which he really enjoyed, very tender.  The service was fantastic, which is always a plus.  All in all, a great meal.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite restaurant.  It's become my go-to for special occasions, guests, and any time I want a great meal.  I've been there maybe half a dozen times now, and it's always been consistently great.  Love the building, love the atmosphere, love the service.  Only quibble is that sometimes it's hard to get a reservation, but then the restaurant is only half empty (e.g. V-day we had dinner there at 5PM cuz that was their only time available before 8PM, but the restaurant was half empty!)  Some comments on the comments: Yes, their menu is small-ish.  You won't be overwhelmed with choices, but they have plenty to choose from.  Also, their food is local and seasonal, so what you ate in Nov you probably won't get in May.  Also, their portion sizes are very reasonable.  It's definitely a place where you might want to order a starter if you're very hungry.  In terms of starters, I've had the brussel sprouts (yum!), the noshing board (delish and even made my mustard hating husband like the whole grain mustard), and the chopped salad (yummy way to get your daily serving of veggies).  I remember LOVING the salmon the first time I had it.  I'm definitely getting the short ribs next time if they're still available.  My dad had the gluten free hamburger and was in heaven.  He was so happy to find a place with a GF burger and it was the first real burger he's eaten in several years.  They also have regular daily specials, so every time you go in you can probably get something new and different.  I ate the bacon smore dessert, and honestly, I wasn't that huge of a fan of the chocolate covered bacon.  It was a little too rich for me.  The rest of the dish was delicious though.  Also tried the fig pie, and it was amazing!  The death by chocolate was also very good and not too rich.  This is my favorite place to eat in Phoenix at the moment.",

The restaurant does have  a 'cool' vibe and the patio is nice, however we were seated in a pretty tight table outside, against a wall, behind a tree...that wasn't a great start to our anniversary dinner. We started with the mac n' cheese, which my husband swears is the best ever! He had the mussels and I had the short ribs (note* if you're preggo, this restaurant may be on the 'after baby' list as it has a lot of shellfish and ingredients that you can't eat when your pregnant). Overall the service was 'ok', our server was efficient, but didn't seem to really want to be there, just get her job done. Overall, food was good, service was ok.. and i wish I could say ambiance was stellar, but I think we got the short end of the stick.",

Started off with the roasted Brussels sprouts that were perfected roasted  and tossed in a light sauce and crumbled bacon on top. Mac and Cheese, not your average run of the mill but rather corkscrew pasta with a light cream sauce that had a hint of whole grain mustard. This is a must. Also the table had the Grilled cheese and tomato soup sauce. This was very good as well. They have about 10 solid entrees that range from $13 dollars ( burger) to $24 for the Seared Tuna. Our group had Salmon, butternut squash risotto, Short Ribs!!! All very good. They have a unusually dessert of Chocolate bacon s'mores. This was in my book just ok. 2 strips of bacon dipped in chocolate, served with 2 homemade marshmallows (killer) and some graham crackers that sat above some homemade Carmel sauce? That was just ok. All in All dinner was really very good. Will be back with the family to sample other items as well.",

Cozy up to the outdoor fireplace with a glass of wine or bourbon or savor the smells from the open kitchen indoors at the bar or at one of the butcher-wood like tables. Everything is good. Seriously. Have the Mac and Cheese, slup the soup, graze on the salads or salivate over one of the entrees. The staff is knowledgeable and eager to help you find your perfect meal and libation. I enjoy spending my dollars on food that is thoughtfully prepared and supports local farmers. It's all here. The staff is interesting. I have never failed when dining alone to have an interesting conversation with the bartender or expo or manager about books, world politics, wine or you name it. This place is a keeper in my book.",

    "text": "So dinner last night at Beckett's Table, featuring beer can chicken to promote the release of Four Peaks Hop Knot in a can was fantastic!  When the main course arrived it looked so good I dove in without even taking a picture.  The whole roasted chicken came with sides of potato salad and coleslaw, and garnished with nothing other than a Hop Knot beer can.  It fit the occasion, and was all delicious.  These items are not part of the regular menu at Beckett's Table, but they were a testament to the culinary aptitude none the less.   Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted and advised our table wasn't quite ready yet.  During the few minutes we had to wait, we were checked on 3 times by various staff members.  Almost overkill but much preferred to the alternative.  For a Thursday night it was very busy but we were still shown to our table very close to our reservation time.  Once being seated, we were greeted and served drinks and water refills by 3 different people.  At this point I wasn't quite sure who would be serving us, which became a bit confusing.  After several minutes our actual server, whom we had not seen yet, showed up.  He was a bit inattentive and didn't time his \"check-ins\" very well.  I can't say the service was bad, but it seemed a bit awkward; which was a contrast from the initial attention we received before being sat.  We began the evening with an appetizer of roasted beets, which are on the regular menu.  The medley of white, yellow, and red beets came topped with herbs (rosemary and parsley I think), feta cheese, and pecans.  It was a great combination of flavors.  Two types of rolls, wheat and cheddar topped, were served as well;  thankfully we were only provided 1 each or I might have filled myself up on bread before the main course arrived. I would have loved to try desert, as I've read some good reviews, but I was stuffed.   All in all, the food was great, the beer was great, and the service was OK.  I definitely look forward to going back and trying more of the regular menu items; I left with an overall good taste in my mouth.",

The service was awful, our server \"Brian\" started off the evening with a superb and arrogant display of his English knowledge and proceeded to tell us that their wine \"special\" for the night was cheap crap when I inquired.... Then why is it on the menu??? Then, I ordered my favorite dish - the mussels and there was a spoiled one in there. Have you ever tasted a spoiled mussel? I have never ever tasted spoiled seafood at a good restaurant. It tastes like rotten eggs, but you can taste it in your mouth for hours to come... and hopefully you won't puke it up later. NASTY!!!  The server barely acknowledged this and the manager stated that \"that's mother nature for you\". Excuse me? I understand the risks of eating seafood, but you should never handle a complaint like that... an \"I'm so sorry,\" would have been the minimal acceptable response. Finally, everyone was getting free mini desserts (some chocolate cake thing) and our server never brought ours.. very obviously... and never comped us for the mussels... not even a 10% discount... If they treat their loyal customers in such a manner, especially on their first anniversary, then I think there are other restaurants where I can become loyal instead. ***********************************************************************    Original review:   Addicting! Roasted mussels are to die for!!! I keep getting this. The appetizer menu could use some work, but the desserts make up for it. Chocolate bacon s'mores and the pint of Guiness desserts are fascinating. Service is excellent and atmosphere is inviting. It's really busy though, so you better have a reservation. Nice addition to the hood!!! Finally.",

Sort of s long wait when you have a reservation I thought. Once seated, we ordered two apps, the Mac and cheese and deviled egg of the day. Deviled eggs were good, but we're not homogenous my filled. Some were pretty light on filling while others were over filled. I was surprised at the lack of care taken in the presentation. The Mac and cheese was delicious however. Upon completion of the apps, our server gave the spiel about specialties and promptly forgot part of the description. We ordered the short rib and Shepard's pie. Both were very tasty and I would order either again in the future. We also ordered Cheddar biscuits, which were really good too. They come with Apple butter not regular, and it was very strong tasting (personally I am not a big fan of Apple butter but those who enjoy it would probably like theirs). Dessert was the apparently popular home made deconstructed smores. This was tasty but messy. The chocolate covered bacon was good, but large and overwhelmed the other components. Still tasted good over all though! Price for two with red hen beers was $90 without tip. Overall, our waitress was sub par, not very friendly, lacked full knowledge of the menu, and reacted strangely to standard pleasantries. She sort of stared without replying when we answered her questions. However the food was quite tasty, better than many places I have been but not the best I have ever had.   That gives it a 4 in my book and I would return and recommend to others. However I think Citizen Public House may be my preference for a similar type of meal and far better service.",

Can't believe I haven't reviewed it before - I've been here with my parents, boyfriend, out-of-town visitors, and friends, and everyone has loved it as much as me!  It's consistently good (and I've tried at least half the menu without a bad experience).  We never leave without ordering the cheddar bacon biscuits.  The bacon s'mores are worth trying at least once.  Some apps, like grilled cheese or mac and cheese, can be meals in themselves.  For entrees, my favorites are the cast iron chicken (the only chicken I ever find worth ordering at a restaurant), osso buco, and short ribs.  TRY THIS PLACE.",

My main dish, which was a fish dish (can't really remember the name) was really bland, and uninspired.  Maybe there are superior options, but for what I considered a higher tier price point, you can certainly do much better with other restaurants.  My cocktail was ok, and I really can't comment on appetizers or dessert as I didn't partake.  Overall, it was ok, but I don't think I'll be back with my group.",

    "text": "Oh my gosh where do I begin? BF and I got reservations for restaurant week here last night but didn't even do the restaurant week menu because they just serve too many delicious things that we did not want to miss. The ambiance is great, I loved it when they opened the restaurant up to allow us to enjoy the amazing weather we've been getting lately and our waitress was excellent and very attentive.   Started off with the Grilled cheese and soup appetizer. I wish that every single time in the past I was craving comfort food, I had been able to order this dish. The grilled cheese is deliciously gooey and the soup was the perfect consistency for dipping. I ordered the Shrimp and Sausage entree and Dave got the Short ribs. Short ribs looked like kind of a small serving but I think it was because of the size of the plate. We also felt there was not enough potato with the short rib. Regardless of size, he wanted to lick the plate clean but I wouldn't let him for fear of embarrassment. My shrimp and sausage dish was perfection. The grits were creamy and buttery and the amount of shrimp served was just right. Dessert time, bacon covered in chocolate? for reals? Yes! their twist on smores was different than anything I've ever eaten and I loved every bite.   Can't wait to visit again and try the sausage pasta that our server recommended!",

The ambience, vibe, and service is also wonderful. I love love love their short rib, but save room for one of the many fabulous desserts. The. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was that I took my boyfriend there for his birthday and had even told the receptionist when making the reservation. She said a courtesy dessert would come out and I think she said happy birthday would be written (can't remember). Even when I mentioned lightly to the server it was his birthday nothing was done and we ordered dessert so that was a little disappointing. So besides a birthday treat this place is amazing and delicious!",

    "text": "My wife & I had dinner at Beckett's Table this Sat (9/21) to celebrate our eighth wedding anniversary, and I would say we made the perfect choice to have dinner.  The ambience had a great feel, as the place was pretty full with customers, well decorated, and the sound of chatter, laughter, and good cheer..., just like a family get together.  The crew is very organized and right on the ball; finished plates removed quickly, water always poured (great tasting water), and courteous and friendly servers.    We were attracted to Beckett's Table by the four star rating on Yelp, and also due to the menu special, as this week was Arizona Fall Restaurant Week, Sept. 21st - 29th, and participating restaurants offer three course meal for a one great price. Beckett's has an alcohol drink included.  As a starter, we ordered the grilled cheese sandwich...a great tasty choice.  1st course: I ordered the roasted cauliflower & grain salad, kale, dried fall fruit; this was a unique combination of ingredients which definitely made this entre delight. The flavors were light and innovative. My wife ordered fennel & potato soup, red bartlett pear, marcona almonds; I enjoy Indian Cuisine, and this took me to India with a contemporary flavor(s)...I enjoyed this soup dearly.  2nd course: my wife ordered the tender duck confit, braised lentils, ratatouille of mushrooms, eggplant, fall squash, fig glaze; this main entree was to die for, the Duck had a seared and crispy texture and the meat so dark and tender & tasty, complimented nicely with ratatouille of mushrooms and eggplant...I hope this entree stays on their menu year round! I ordered the grilled scottish salmon, red quinoa & edamame salad, asian vinaigrette; Overall the plate was tasty, though the Salmon did not have a lot of flavor itself, so, I added some salt to help it..., the entree did not wow me...but it was savory due to the combination of sauces.   Final course: We both ordered the apple pecan bread pudding, raisins, bourbon sauce; for both of us, it was a simple tasty dessert, no wow factor here. The bourbon sauce was a bit strong...; this dessert was not what we were expecting...although it was quite pleasant.   During the meal I ordered a cocktail, the \"Legend City\" as it is called, named after the amusement park that was here in the Valley some 25 years ago. The drink sounded great on paper, but the bartender overwhelmed the drink with too much bourbon..., overall, the structure, people, and food is fantastic!",

    "text": "My wife and I have been to Beckett's Table on two separate occasions and both have been extremely underwhelming.  1st Visit:  It was our weekly date night, Friday, and I schedule a reservation for 2 at 7PM.  We arrived approximately 5 minutes before 7 and were told that a table would be ready shortly and that we could order a drink from the bar while we waited.  We decided to wait to grab a drink until we were sat because it would only be a few minutes; boy were we wrong.  We waited outside for a few minutes before my wife got cold, in which case, we headed back inside to wait in the VERY cramped waiting area.  At about 10 past 7, my wife asked the hostess how much longer to expect for our table and she was instructed that they were just waiting for a table to open.  While we continued to wait, we saw several groups of individuals arrive and seated by the hostess before us.  As the clock continued to run, we grew increasingly impatient.  At 7:30, we began to get frustrated, but we decided to wait because of the glowing reviews we had received from friends.  As it approached 8PM, we were ready to head out the door, when the hostess, finally, told us our table was ready.  We were sat at a 2 person table near the kitchen.  On this visit, I ordered the short ribs and my wife ordered the cast iron chicken, which were both good, however, our experience at the front of the house really soured our experience.  When I schedule a reservation, I understand that a restaurant will, likely, not be able to accommodate my party at the exact time specified, but it should be within a reasonable time frame.  At no point should an hour be a reasonable wait time for someone with a reservation.  The other frustrating part was that it seemed that they were waiting for a 2 person table to open up before seating us.  All the groups that we saw sat before us were 4+, which made the wait much more frustrating.  After this visit, we told ourselves that we would not return and that if we wanted Modern American-style cuisine, we would rather visit Chelsea's Kitchen or Rusconi's because their food quality is comparable and their service is significantly better.  2nd Visit:  We vowed to never return, unfortunately, we broke that vow and regret it.  Our friend had heard good things from other friends and decided she wanted to eat here for her birthday dinner.  We had a party for 10 and a reservation for 6PM on a Tuesday.  My wife and I were one of the firsts to arrive, 10-15 minutes early, and we were immediately taken to our table, which was the long bench on the East wall, with tables pushed together.  My wife and I ordered cocktails from our waitress and both came within a reasonable amount of time.  As more members of our party arrived, we all stood up to greet each person with handshakes or hugs and to say our hellos.  Well, that eastern-most table just happened to be next to the server station in the northeast corner of the restaurant.  Apparently, servers get very upset if you obstruct the most convenient pathway for them; not the only pathway, but the most convenient.  We had multiple servers get angry at us for blocking the walkway from the server station to the south part of the restaurant.  Don't forget that the servers could have easily walked west to the next walkway and head south.  This happened nearly every time we stood up to say hello or goodbye to someone.  Don't worry, that was not our only complaint this time.  We went ahead and ordered.  My wife and I both ordered the cheeseburger, both without the bun; she ordered medium and I medium rare.  I, however, ordered mine with a side salad, instead of the chips it normally comes with.  When the food came out, mine had no bun, but it had chips instead of the salad.  When I mentioned the lack of a salad, she brought one out, but forgot to bring the dressing.  My wife's came out with chips, but still had the bun, however, there were no toppings on the burger; no mustard, no pickles.  When she mentioned it, the waitress grabbed a couple of ramekins with the toppings.  Without a bun, I cut my burger with my fork only to find the burger to be brown throughout. My wife's burger was exactly what I would expect, slightly pink inside.  Finally, I bit into my burger only to find that it was overcooked and burnt on the outside.  At this point, I was over it.  Burgers are so simple to grill properly, yet, they seemed to find a way to mess it up.  It really did not help that the waitress seemed to have a snarky attitude every time we pointed something out or asked her for something.  We figured this visit might be different because the food and our waitress were good the first visit, but this time, was the opposite.  We have concluded that in order for this place to be considered good, every aspect of the restaurant has to be on their game and at this point, we haven't seen them able to put it all together.  We will continue to avoid this place, if at all possible.",

Coming from out of town, I heard about Beckett's opening a few weeks ago and was thrilled to get to try it on this trip... it did not disappoint!  (Wish I could export you to Vancouver so you can help out our resto who attempted the gourmet comfort menu but without the skill of this!)  Service is excellent!  Everything on the menu we had was divine... the bread service is excellent.  You must get the cheese and sundried tomato bread.  So good!  For appies, the grilled cheesewith pancetta and fire roasted pepper soup is fabulous.  I had the salad which is incredibly fresh and well-done, but I would definitely get the more unique items.  The mains are equally fabulous.  I LOVED my short ribs - they were flavorful, fork-tender and the sides were amazing.  Hubby's stew was a bit spicy for me but very tasty.  The only minor downside to the place is that they need a bit of work on guestimating the food quantities... we were getting to dessert around  8pm and had our hearts set on the Death By Chocolate, but were told it had run out for the evening... who runs out of dessert?  Anyway, that's really the only con and I suppose it's saved me some calories for the next time I'm back :)",

French fries:  tasty  This place is always packed, so maybe it's just me.  The ambiance is great, service is superb, parking is convenient, and the overall vibe is inviting.  Just not my taste as far as the food goes.

We originally went to another restaurant but was given a 2 hour wait so we decided to look on Yelp and see what was in the neighborhood and Beckett's Table it was!  We waited for about 5 minutes before we were seated.  The wine list is small but mighty!  They have some pretty good selections and a lot of U.S. made wine which is good in my book!  We ordered 2 appetizers, the brussel sprouts and the chicken meatballs!  Both of the dishes were really good and the portions were just right.  Then we ordered our main courses... there were 4 of us and we ordered the Pork Chop, Short Ribs, and the beef bourguignon shepard's pie.  All of it was really good!  There is a sort of \"richness\" in all of their dishes and a hat should be tipped to the chef because not many places create interesting and unique flavors.  The one thing that was off was our server.  She seemed really disconnected which really annoyed me considering we were there for the complete experience.  It seemed like she was in a rush to get us in and out.  Before we even got our appetizers she asked if we were ready to order our main course and before we were done with our main courses she was already pushing dessert.  We also had to ask another waiter to get us silverware because she never replaced it after our appetizers.  I will come back here and really make it a 1st choice in the future...lets hope we get a better waiter/waitress!",

    "text": "Beckett's table is sort of new American bistro to the tune of Sweet Home Alabama as there is a definite Southern rural sort of thematic element underlying a top class eatery. You see it in the open wood decor and internal brick facade and the homages to the humble pig throughout the establishment, from the little pig statues at various places and the pig themed head wrap I saw one of the chef's wearing.   However, don't be fooled by the laid-back Southern charm, this place is one well-run eating venue. The wait staff is extremely polite and respectful and provides good service without overly hovering or checking if you like what you are eating five seconds. They don't have to, they know they food is good!  I took my parents out to brunch here on Mother's day, which they opened early for as they are usually only an evening eating establishment. Though the don't provide overly large portions what they do serve is wonderful. My mother had the chicken fried steak, which seems like it is done with panko breading and was nicely crisp and the sausage gravy was delicious. It is not as good as the chicken fried steak at Texaz grill on 16th street but that place specializes in the dish. As for my father, he had a brisket hash comprised of cube brisket mixed with sauteed peppers and onions. As for myself, I had the oven roasted shrimp and sausage that comes in a spicy tomato sauce, along with creamy grits and I had the additional two fried eggs on top. I enjoyed it though it was a small dish of the grits and would have loved more but that is more of the bistro influence, smaller amounts but what is provided, top quality.  We also had some drinks and I ordered the Pimm's cup, which was refreshing and heavy on the muddled cucumber, which I liked but might not appeal to everyone. As with the food, I would have liked to have seen a drink of a somewhat larger size (I guess it is the thematic element to my review - more, more!).  The only part where I wasn't so impressed with the quality was the dessert portion of the meal. We had the creme brulee, which was coffee flavored and well, don't mess with a classic folks, leave it plain, no coffee addition, but it was of a good size and came in this cool little cast iron pot (that down-home Southern influence). We also had the pecan and fig pie which was a little less like a pecan pie and a bit more cake-like. When you say pecan pie I tend to think it should be a bit more gooey and syrupy  and as for the coffee, it was okay but I encourage the establishment to upgrade a bit. Maybe go to providing a french press at the table versus pre-brewed coffee. Chelsea' kitchen would be a good place to benchmark against relative to this recommendation.  All in all I liked it and more of a 4.5 than a 4 in my book but I'll go back again and see if my review rises but overall an exceptional dining establishment, only enhanced by the high quality wait service provided by extremely polite employees at Beckett's Table.",

The salmon was waaaay too salty. at first, I thought the chef had spilled a bottle of salt on it. So I got the sea bass instead. It was much better than the salmon. But the appetizers and salads were all very good. And my husband got the short ribs! Definitely recommend those!!",

    "text": "We had an amazing time at Beckett's. They were about 10 minutes late with our reservation so we were sitting at the bar waiting. The manager offered to buy us our first round and apologized for the table not being ready. Everyone, from the bussers, to the servers, bartenders, and manager were affable and genuinely interested in providing great service. It was a great atmosphere am around. It's a foodie-type restaurant that does not come off as pretentious, which is rare in the Phoenix area.   The food was excellent. I had the pork chop and my wife had the pan seared shrimp and grits. Both were unbelievably good. We also shared the brussel sprout appetizer and I had the cauliflower chowder, both of which were also surprisingly good as well. It was hands down, the best meal we have had in the Valley, and our tab with drinks was about $80 (accounting for the round that they bought us).  We will definitely be back. It also looks like a great place to bring the kids if you're dining a bit earlier. They have a fairly big $7 kids menu.",

The owners make your experience a personal one, which is always great. All t he food we had was AMAZING! Beats and garlic appetizer, chicken, ribs and red pepper cannelloni's. Price may be on the high side but it's SO totally worth it! I'll be making repeat trips back!",

Beckett's Table is the huge  tree slab that must be 25 feet long right as you walk in.. bar area ? impressive... People were eating there also.. many more tables though.  We had a group of 30 and they were able to accomodate us in two long rows of tables in the back of the restaurant... just perfect..   On to the food. Shepherds Pie was the best ever, big chunks of beef,, no burger. I had the Pork Oso Buco.. wonderful,, melt in your mouth. fall apart pork . on top of german spaetzle.. yea spaetzle..  go figure.. what a wonderful combo of the pork and the firm bready noodles.  Very creative and original.. The kitchen is wide open to the restaurant so you can see \"the show\" and talk to the line chef's while they prepare your meal. Really nice team..  The owner and head chef came to our table to make sure we were satisfied and enjoyed our meal.  yes !  when was the last time that happened to you!   great customer service.  GREAT Beers and Ales !  Kilt lifter on tap.. one of my fav's.  Some southern flair in the menu as well.. Chicken and fish dishes .. White Sea Bass looked fantastic .. I'll save it for my next visit.   A great sound level in the restaurant...   The big long Beckett's table was crowded with happy couples...   what a great idea.. sitting across from each other and next to other...  Get to know \"your neighbor\"  or not..  I am a big fan of the communal table though.... Must have been at least 20 other 4 tops as well but I dig the big tree slab... must be the bar section too..  fun fun fun..See if you can find all the pig statues around the restaurant..  Oh wait.. save room for the fig/pecan pie.. oh mama it is great !",

    "text": "DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.    Took my Fiance there for her birthday dinner.  Staff was nice but our waitress was VERY SLOW with taking our order.  The water was fancy in that it was delivered in a carafe on the table-DON'T let that fool you...it literally tasted like it was fished out of the canal a few blocks over. (Note: when the staff refills the glasses of water, the carafe often touches the rim of the glass, Do they really disinfect those between tables?  or is it just refilled...)  We Ordered the fried deviled eggs for an appetizer, they were a pub-like approach to a current food trend that fell short, the only plus was the dipping sauce.  15 min after we finished our apps she came back to take our order; I ordered the short ribs-WOW WAS I DISAPPOINTED.  First off-IT WAS ONLY ONE RIB so don't be fooled by the menu.  VERY bland, no flavor at all-after three bites I wound up boxing it and took it home for our chocolate lab.  My Fiance had the chicken meatball appetizer in smokey tomato sauce (which was really BBQ sauce), and it was actually good; so much so that I finished hers as she's not a big eater (thanks for that).  Ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits also and my fiance told our waitress that although she  hates Red Lobster, their biscuits were better.  The waitress did take them off the bill.  We were so disappointed that we didn't stick around for the complimentary dessert...not even the bacon s'mores.   What was also disappointing was that when I made the reservations, they asked if it was any type of special occasion; I told them that it was my fiance's birthday-I would have expected the Manager or someone other than the wait staff to come by and acknowledge this.    Overall, the service was slow AND it was Tuesday night, the food was disappointing at best; we will not be back...went across the street to Bosa donuts for some good dessert.

    "text": "Its really strange the things that make a dinner \"amazing.\" Sometimes its the food, other times its the drinks, but in the case of Beckett's Table its the thought that went into the physical construction of the restaurant when it comes to noise.  Take a big room, fill it full of people talking, people making food, servers trying not to drop things, a bar, and a small waiting area with patrons chomping at the bit to sit down and play \"piggy in a trough.\" Mix all of these together in most any eating establishment in Phoenix, and you have a room so loud you'd swear you were at a KISS concert.   But this isn't the case at Beckett's. They took the extra minute of forethought and had noise reducing baffling installed in the rafter space. This means you can sit and have a conversation, at a normal voice and you can hear the person across from you. Now this isn't \"always\" a great thing, but with the person I dine with all the time, its nice to be able to talk without shouting.   And then there's the food.  I've eaten at Beckett's many times. Ever been to a place where you can say \"damn, I've never had a bad meal there!\"? Well, that's Beckett's for me. From the Pork osobucco to the burger to the veg dishes I've had, everything has been good. For me, that's pretty rare, and puts Beckett's on a very short list of places I'll always go to.  So why not 5 stars? There's never a steak on the menu, and this confuses me. It forces me to have to eat other things, which sometimes annoys me. I'm a spoiled fat guy, and I want things my way, damnit.",

    "text": "We wanted to try Beckett's Table since it opened and went with much excitement. I read from the reviews that experiences were vastly mixed, but hoped for the best. We were definitely disappointed. Let me say that I rarely would review a restaurant because I am not a restaurant critic and I think it is so extremely subjective. But this was such a blaaaahhhh experience that I have to speak up.   This was all service related, honestly. There were so many opportunities for our whole experience (or at least our attitude about it) to be turned around that it is almost comical.   The restaurant is lovely. It is clear that much attention went into the design. Love the open kitchen.....the restrooms were spotless and very nicely executed (I would love to know how many fingers just HAVE to touch the broken glass light feature there). We were offered to wait for inside but since it was a lovely evening and there was no wait for the patio, we chose to be seated there for our party of 3 at 7pm on a Wednesday night. This was a great choice because the decibel level inside the restaurant was deafening.   A waiter came over about 10 minutes after we were seated and asked for our drink order. Then another waiter delivered them about 5 minutes later. We never ever saw the first or second waiter again. And we waited...and we waited....and we waited. 31 minutes after we were seated, still with one member of our party having no drink in front of him a very harried waiter came over to take our order. It was clear that something had gone wrong somewhere....an on the fly firing? Someone walking off the job? Who knows...but he definitely did get dumped an additional station it was clear. That's not the issue. Things happen, but some acknowledgement that it was a very long wait should have been offered. We gave our order including a drink for our friend. Then about 10 minutes later a basket of rolls was set on the table. At this point it was close to 8 and we were starving....still no drink for our friend. So the next time the waiter ran by frazzled we stopped him and asked again. He had no idea what we were talking about, but quickly came around and the drink did show up. Food started arriving and here are our observations on the food itself:  We shared quite a few dishes because 1) we wanted to try alot and 2) we had some dietary restrictions. We didn't order ANYTHING special or different than it appeared on the menu.   Roaster Pepper/Tomato Soup:  Excellent but not exciting...you can get it all over town  Gazpacho-Shrimp Ceviche: Excellent  Iceberg Wedge with Greeen Goddess Dressing: I loved this, but my two friends did not. I thought the flavor of the dressing was amazing and it was served perfectly. They felt it didn't quite hit the mark.   Roasted Beets: AMAZING! We all loved this even though it was quite cold by the time it got to the table  Salmon on Baguette: I didn't love but my friends thought it was one of the best they had tried. It was a bit aspic-y for my taste although once i unearthed the capers I was a happy girl.   Veggie Spaetzel: My friend was SO excited about this dish but it came cold and completely tasteless. We each put a serving on our plate and no one even finished that or went back for more.   When the waiter came to clear the table he asked if  he should leave the spaetzel for us to \"enjoy\" and we remarked that we hadn't enjoyed it at all and he should take it away, which left a perfect opportunity for him to apologize and asked more details. Maybe even remove this $5 item from the bill? But he DIDN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WE SAID!   We ordered dessert anyways since that was our biggest reason for going in the first place. We ordered coffee which was delicious and the darling busser/helper/whatever they call it that took our coffee order came back and let us know that they were brewing a fresh pot of decaf for us and that it would be 4 1/2 minutes and lo and behold, 5 minutes later we had coffee!   Chocolate Covered Bacon Smores: OK...we were super excited about this and well...let's face it. Anything with this combination of ingredients can't be bad, but again, it didn't quite deliver. The homemade toasted marshmallows were gritty  and not gooey like we had hoped for.   Fig Pie: To die for. Simply put. Delicious and perfect in every way.   I never hold wait staff accountable in their tip for food that I don't like or don't think was well prepared, but in almost every single instance on this visit, any problems were either a direct result of their time management or lack of customer service. We are not difficult people and have a glass half full approach to life. The simplest gesture could have turned our whole experience around. I did something i haven't done in 20 years which is to tip under 20% and even that we probably shouldn't have done but I had to on some level believe that perhaps the management had more involvement of this than was seen to our eyes.",

    "text": "Beckett's Table is a fantastic restaurant for people who want great food, great wine, and great service. My wife and I dined there with a couple of friends on a Saturday evening. Well, we got there about 5:15 ... we were going to a a game that night. Our server was a very friendly English woman who knew her wine, had dutifully tried all the specials for the day (which I wish I could have also done), and was highly attentive. Could have also been that there were only about 5 other parties there.   The wife and I split four smaller dishes, sides and appetizers, because we wanted to eat more than just a couple things and not have to roll ourselves out of the restaurant and food come at the game. We samples the grits and sausage with mustard, roasted beets, bacon and cheddar biscuits with apple butter and the vegetable chop salad. The biscuits were purely pleasurable food. Not healthy, but delicious in every way. They were airy, the butter was excellent and featured chunks of apple, not just apple flavor, and they were presented piping hot. Our salad came at the same time and was a beautiful presentation of spring mix lettuce, colorful carrots, tiny tomatoes, and more veggies with a tangy vinaigrette. The grits and beets came together and we loved them both. The grits were very creamy and the sausage on top was herby and flavorful, but not heavy. The beets came roasted with nuts and cheese ... which I was not sure about ahead of time. I came away convinced. The cheese (creamy feta) complemented the sweetness of the beets very well we thought.  Then we ordered dessert. The desserts are smaller potions. Our group appreciated this because we could get multiple for the table ... and we were almost full already. the special was an almond scone with dark chocolate fudgy ice cream mousse. The scone was flavorful, delicate and delicious. The mousse was tremendous. Creamy, chocolately, DARK. We also ordered the chocolate-covered bacon s'mores. They come with delicious whipped peanut butter and caramel sauce. Our waitress told us it was the best thing for those who were \"adventurous\". If by adventurous you mean, \"loves delicious, unique, inventive desserts\", then she was 100% right.  And we are that kind of people. And we loved the s'mores.   Thanks Beckett's Table for an excellent dining experience!",

Can that be right? The service was amazing. While the food the pretty stellar too, the service still stands out as being the best part of my experience there. We grabbed a few small apps to get things going. Everything I tried, the roasted veggies, the brussel sprouts, the mac and cheese (I ate 1 noodle...the lactose...)  was delicious. Mealtime was killer too. I shared the braised short rib and salmon with Christina Y. Short rib was phenom, salmon a little overcooked but it's all good, still tasty!   And then dessert arrived. Every. Single. Dessert on the menu. I decided to throw caution to the wind and fork a taste at each and definitely felt like the sweet potato pie was the clear winner. I don't even remember everything else because that stood out as perfection in a pie. MMM. Thanks Gabi M for a great recommendation and for allowing me to eat pie!  Know Before You Go:   It can be noisy, so if you're looking for a quiet evening alone, grab a corner of the restaurant where it's less rowdy or prepare to be exhilarated the sights and sounds.",

I made the mistake of ordering the beef bourginon shepards pie, it had three little chunks of stewed meat inside. It made me sad and yearn for my dates plate of \"fork tender shortribs\". Theres no need for a knife. I could eat that every night for the rest of my life. Also while im at it,i must tell you about these chocolate covered bacon smores dessert. Holy cow.

The atmosphere is pleasant, the service is good, the prices are reasonable and the food is good. We tried the Mac n Cheese, Bacon Cheddar Biscuits, Grits and Sausage and all were great. We shared a couple salads one was the Chop and the other was a daily special. Both were also good. For the mains, we had the Short Ribs which were very good, Pork Stew (all agreed this was the best) and the Shepherd's Pie (our least favorite) and a Steak (daily special). For desert we shared the Cobbler (Amazing), Death by Chocolate which was good and the novel Chocolate dipped Bacon S'mores which we had to try, they were good btw. All in all Beckett's Table is a welcome addition that is great for most any occasion.",

Food was excellent. I ordered the Osso Bucco. It was delicious. Very different than other Osso Bucco I have had before. I also tried the Short Ribs and Macaroni and Cheese. All were delicious. Cocktails were inventive and tasty. I ordered the Chocolate Bacon S'more- I felt like I had to try it.  A little goes a long way but it was tasty. I tried the Pecan Pie with the Cream Cheese Ice Cream. The ice cream was unbelievable! The meal was delicious...such good food in such a great environment. What an unexpected surprise. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "REALITY CHECK!!! Sorry People.  Another over rated chef owned restaurant in Phoenix, and another example of this not being a foodie town.  Ambience is well done, not original, think a lower budget Chelsea Kitchen. Nice beamed ceiling, nice bar, nice community bar table, oh those LGO lamps in the windows. Nice but not original.  Food was OK. Nothing that I tried was great, just good. I had the salmon, good not great. My friend had the burger. If you as a chef driven restaurant cannot figure out how to do a great burger, then do not put one on the menu. Hint, add fat to the meat. A dry burger on a basic bun, with frozen fries from a bag just will not cut it.   The menu reads well but in my opinion and on a first visit not what I would expect in quality.  All the 4 and 5 star reviews on here I would expect though in this Phoenix market.   Service was friendly.   Note. If you are going to do an open kitchen then everything should be presentable, including the staff. Allowing the dishwasher to wrap himself in hefty trash bags so he does not get his clothes wet during his shift, and looking like some sort of space age homeless person is a bit odd visually.",

The food quality is excellent, everything tasted very fresh.  The portions are small.  They don't seem to use any spices.  The menu is very simple, and they evidently strive for perfection with every serving.  They bring a bottle of chilled water to the table and pour whenever your glass becomes less than about 2/3 full.  Unfortunately sometimes the waiter carries a bottle between tables and pours from that, touching the bottle to your glass.  That's a no-no.  We found the food bland.  It was nicely presented- a small pile in the middle of an oversized plate.  But we left hungry.  I could go on about the ingredients and how they were prepared.  But I think you get the sense of what I'm saying.  We don't intend to go back.  There are other nice choices in that area.",

I'll start off by saying that the ambiance of this place is amazing.  They truly did a good job with the look and feel.   I'm sure if I was just coming in for a drink with friends, I wouldn't have been unimpressed.  I mean, you can't really mess up a rum and coke can you?   But I didn't come in for drinks, I came in for a celebration dinner with my family.    The food was mediocre at very best.    I'm not going to get into the specifics of how bad everything was or the fact that they were out of BOTH of my Mom's first two choices on the menu (its a small menu and a busy weekend night....how about a little preparation?)  I had tried:  \"Beckett Table Signature Fork Tender Short Ribs\"...if that was their signature..yikes.  bland, boring, and small.  \"Fire Roasted Green Chili Pork Stew\"....just blah. nothing special.  \"Bacon Cheddar Biscuits\" .....nothing tasty about these at all.  \"BT Bacon Biscuit Stuffing\"....burnt and would have been better out of a box.

Mustard seeds added a nice texture. This is one of the best dishes I have ever had. It is True culinary expertise. My wife had the cast iron petite chicken entree. Good color on the skin and very juicy. The pork green chile stew cost Beckett's the fifth star. The green chiles were roasted but they didn't peel them. They also added a lot of something very sweet to the stew which burned when they heated it. My server immediately got me a burger to keep me happy. Burger was good. Prices were reasonable for the great food. We will be back with friends.",

The short ribs are one of the best things on the menu for avid carnivores but there are also a plethora of great options for vegetarians as well. This is probably one of the only restaurants I have seen where the veggie platter actually looks like a well thought out dish rather than whatever the chef has left over in the pantry.  Beckett's table has a great wine selection and even the house blends are delicious for the untrained wine enthusiasts (like me). Cocktails also look delicious though I have never had the opportunity to try them. Dessert was FANTASTIC! Split the chicory coffee creme brulee and it was tasted exactly like a delicious hot cup of coffee!  All in all, great place for any and all types of groups and definitely worth the visit. I would rank this as one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Beckett's Table. Myself and two other friends chose this place to celebrate our birthdays together.  I arrived promptly at 5:00 pm for our 5:00 pm dinner reservations. This is a large restaurant, and there were no other customers there when I walked in.    There were several staff members seated in the back, having a \"pre-service meeting\".  The hostess would not seat me because this meeting was taking place. So, I stood around up front for about 10 minutes until the meeting broke up.  The hostess never made it clear why I couldn't just make myself comfortable at one of the dozens of other empty tables, that held no staff members, and wait for my friends to arrive.  Not off to a pleasant, nor welcoming, start.  One of my friends arrived and we started out with cocktails.  She ordered a Pimm's cup, which she had never tried before, and really liked it when it arrived.  Our other friend arrived shortly after, and decided to try the Pimm's cup as well.  However, when her drink was delivered, it was much darker than the one that our other friend had received.  Meanwhile, we all ordered dinner from our waiter, Adrian T., and everything was going along just fine.  Our food arrived and we were all enjoying it.  Two of us ordered both the roasted beet & apple dish, as well as the roasted garlic and cauliflower chowder.  Both were fine, although the chowder was overly-garlic'd.  Coming from the school of \"You Can Never Have Too Much Garlic\", I would never have imagined myself thinking that a dish could have too much garlic, but this one did. We didn't mention anything about it to the server, because he did not consider it a huge deal.  About halfway through our meal, my friend that got the first Pimm's cup, and I, ordered a second round of drinks.  Our friend that had the darker Pimm's cocktail, was struggling to get  the drink through the straw.  It apparently was prepared with too large of cucumber chunks that could not get through the straw and, the drink on the whole tasted vastly inferior to, and different from, the first Pimm's, which was delicious. Since the liquid level of the \"bad Pimm's\" was still about a half-inch from the top of the highball glass, we encouraged our friend to send the drink back, as she clearly was not enjoying it and was not going to consume it.  We flagged down Adrian T. and sent the drink back.  Our friend chose to stick with water, rather than order a different cocktail, since we were just about at the end of dinner.  Two of us ordered dessert though.  It was at this point, that there was a very distinct change in Adrian T.'s demeanor.  He basically just stopped with the pleasantries altogether, and was cold and indifferent to us. When it came time for the check, he laid it down and said nothing.  The station he was using to key-in orders was close to our table, so I got up and asked him if he was Ok.  He didn't stop, or look-up, at all and just kept keying in data while he muttered, \"I'm good.\"  He dropped back off our receipt and credit cards without a word.  No, \"thank you so much\" or \"I hope to see you again\" or any such feel-goody statement that most professional servers deliver to a table as their parting words. It was all very uncomfortable, awkward and uncalled for. We still have no idea what his problem was.   I might try this place again someday, as long as they don't seat me in Adrian T.'s section.",

Starting with appetizers, seriously, how can you decide between deep fried deviled eggs, mac and cheese with crispy pancetta, or a grilled cheese pancetta sandwich served on an asiago cheese rolled and roasted red pepper tomato soup?  The answer is: we couldn't and we had to order all three (which, by the way, is tooooooooo much food).  My husband raved over the tender short ribs, served over creamy mashed potatoes, sauteed veggies, red wine reduction!   And, once again, we all had a hard time deciding over the sides and finally settled on ordering one of each:   bacon cheddar biscuits, candied jalapeno orange butter, the wood oven roasted beckett's bacon biscuit stuffing, and the spinach spaetzle, bread crumbs, pancetta (for which I would totally order a full meal of , but that's just me, as my husband and son where not quite as enamored with it).  Dessert, caused us much consternation and we were much more reserved...probably because we were such gluttons from the start.   May I say that if you are a bacon fan, YOU MUST ORDER the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, caramel,housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter, graham cracker.  Yes, literally it was two huge, thick strips of bacon dipped in dark chocolate - with a side of smores.  Personally, I just at the bacon and let my son eat the smores.    My hubby ordered the chicory coffee creme brulee - which he enjoyed.  I can't wait to go back with friends!   I heard the owners were going to be opening up another concept restaurant (southern cooking) in the old Beefeaters location.  We look forward to giving that a try!",

The short ribs for example, are now $21.00 instead of $16, and you definitely get less food than previously.  I looked at other tables as well, and the trend is throughout the restaurant.  The wines now average $12.00 a glass instead of $9.00.    For me, this is a special occasion place.  The prices are above my pay grade.  It's 3 dollar signs, not 2.

To start, Dad got the deep fried deviled eggs - they were a little bland. Mom got the tomato soup - it was delicious.  For our entrees, Dad had the pork stew - it wasn't very stewy but it was ok and the corn bread was good. Mom had the sea bass - it was ok. I had the short ribs and they were delicious.   For dessert we got the coffee creme brulee and the pecan pie. The creme brulee had a strong coffee flavor - good but strong. The fig pecan pie with citrus ice cream was good, but since I have the palette of a 5 year-old, I prefer classic sugary pecan pie. When we made the reservation, we mentioned that we were celebrating two birthdays so they comped our desserts and put candles on them - very sweet of them.   Overall - very attentive service, the food was fine-excellent depending on what we ordered. I'd go back, but I probably won't bring my foodie parents again.",

Not so hip where it's a flash in the pan business that will be gone in less than a year but you have to wait an hour for a table and spend $100 on dinner, and not so neighborhood that you would wander there every week, possibly in those sweatpants you should never own. It's both cool and cozy, and I think they will be sticking around for quite some time, they've already made it past their year mark.   I ordered a Palmaire, which was a tasty cocktail, and my bf had the Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter, cheers to BT for having that on draft! Then I had the short rib, which was very tasty, but watch out for those onions! Who wants that kind of breath? My bf had the grilled cheese and upgraded to the bowl of tomato soup. He enjoyed it. The food was pretty good, it's not OMG I just died great, but it's good. The staff is very friendly, which is always appreciated. There were a handful of things on the menu that I wanted to try, so that's a good way to keep me coming back.   The one thing I would say is that they need to figure out their layout. The chairs are close enough together that their servers are constantly turning sideways to squeeze through and I kept thinking I needed to scoot in or I got bumped a few times. So they need to move some things around and have the space work a little better. Oh, and their crowd...well it's quite a few people over 50 in there. Which I guess is kinda fitting because I would def take my parents there, but I think trying to attract a younger crowd would be nice. Maybe they should add a happy hour and open a little earlier. I think I will be back. Plenty more food to try, good atmosphere, good price.  ********* Ok I've been a few more times and wouldn't go back at this point. The staff never tells you the specials, you have to find it on the tiny chalkboard next to the bar on your own. The food is ok but rarely great. The vibe and interior decor is great but other areas need improvement.",

    "text": "Based on the Yelp reviews, I was really expecting something special at Beckett's. Unfortunately, everything was a bit bland and the service was extremely slow. In their defense, it was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and it seemed as if only two girls were working the floor. Maybe they were just short staffed? Anyway, the Cast Iron Corn Cake was definitely a great treat to start out. I suggest ordering two or three if you have a big group. It is pretty small for an appetizer. I tried the Steamed Cod for dinner. The fish itself was very fresh but the \"chef's special preparations\" were a bit strange. It came with a quinoa cake that was very dry and fell apart. It was also topped with a strange herb mixture that was too acidic to eat with the Cod. Based on my friend's opinions the burger is the way to go! It was the only dish that received good reviews from the table. I might be back again for drinks and appetizers. But I think I may stop for dinner elsewhere.",

Upon arrival, we were early for our party so we went to the bar to get a drink  Bartender was lifeless and mechanical (2/7/18 6pm)   Generally, we found Becketts to be over priced for average food. Nothing was bad, it was just average.  Had the shortribs and had to use a knife to cut.  This was just undercooked.  Tasty, but undercooked.  Mashed potatoes were smooth, but basically tasteless.  Fish dishes were super small portions.  Good, but not great.   Eh, it was fine, but wan't worth a return visit.",

From the chilled adult beverage menu to the dessert menu Justin Beckett has put together an impressive and challenging array of culinary delights for your dining pleasure.  We've only been here a few times, but BT is fast becoming a favorite.  Hot tip: Get the deviled egg of the day. Yesterday was the eggplant Parmesan. Complete with a tiny (but tasty) parmesan chip about the size of a dime. These things are little single bites of tastebuds joy.  We also had the roasted beet appetizer. This dish was more than enough for the three of us dining.  The entrees for the evening were the roasted chicken (delicious), ribs (moist, tender & tasty) and the flattop seared cheese burger (pretty good, but I'll try something else next time).  The drink menu offers some really tasty concoctions too. If you like a Sazerac, try the Legend City. If you're a native, you'll appreciate the nod to the amusement park. Bring a Ladmo Bag!",

All were delicious. Our favorite was the Pork Osso Bucco!  It's a regular dish per person place but we all shared our entrees because we wanted to try everything. The Brussels Spouts were good too.   Wait staff was friendly!  The girls at the front desk were a little unfriendly but our waitress and helper guy were super nice. :)",

You walk in to see a nice size bar and \"social\" sharing table to your right, and to the left is a very open space with comfy tables and a gorgeous patio. Wherever you choose to sit, you're in for a great experience.  And the food, on top of it all, is stellar.  Everything tastes so fresh.  They do a deviled egg of the day, which should never be missed, and their pork osso buco is fall-off-the-bone tender.  Also, if you sit in the bar area (sharing table or bar outright) they have social hour until 6:30pm with appetizer and drinks specials.  Our favorite go-to's are the roasted beets (hot multi-colored beets w/ roasted onion and apples), and the grilled pancetta grilled cheese with a bowl of soup.  This sandwich soup combo is Ah-Mazing!!! We've tried not ordering it at social hour, but inevitable always break down because it is that delicious :)  If you're looking for good food, and a fun Arcadia atmosphere, then Beckett's Table is a solid go-to.",

Started with the grilled cheese. Ho-hum. Tomato soup doesn't have much flavor and bread was dry. Grilled cheese really just tasted like dry bread with dry cheese.  I ordered the Pan Seared Sea Scallops - green bean, potato, spinach, chorizo, almond, creme fraiche. Ultimately the scallops were cooked well, but the veggies that came with it - I wasn't a huge fan. Just no flavor in them. Very little of them included with the 4 scallops and they really just don't taste like anything. (They are diced pretty small.)  I really wasn't happy with either of the two Chardonnays I had.. both weren't what I was looking for. (Buttery) The service was just OK, but not great.  The rest of my group agreed that their meals weren't what they expected (short ribs, osso bucco and Salmon) and probably wouldn't go back either.",

To start, I had a reservation at 715, called and informed them I was running 5 min late (being courteous) yet when I got there I was not sat until about 750, and I arrived at 721. No empathy from the host, so we decided to get a drink at the bar, and the lady at the bar was not friendly at all, and when my friend ordered a coffee she got the \"death stare of \"really\", but my boyfriend and I ordered cocktails. Hoping once we sat the service from the server would make up for it.....nope. He was as cold as could be, did not seem happy to share about the menu at all. On top of all that he was just so slow and sluggish to do anything. He never checked to see how the food was ... so much for \"2 min, 2 bite check\". If he would have checked I would have ordered a nice glass of wine (lost profit there). Oh and no manager presence.   The mains were just sub par. We had the scallops, pork chop and short rib; none which stood out. The only reason there is a 2nd star is because the cheddar jalapeno biscuits and the mac and cheese were fantastic.   Overall a very disappointing experience, and don't plan to return nor will be recommending. Guess that's why it wasn't super busy on a Saturday night.",

My favorite menu items are (1) Mac 'N' Cheese (when I could eat it before discovering my food allergies) - definitely get the crispy pancetta on top!!! (2) The pecan pie... seriously, just get it. I am a huge desserts fan, a sweet tooth like no-other and this is one of my favorite desserts in the valley! (3) Pork Osso Buco Confit - sub mashed potatoes... you won't regret it. But honestly.... everything is SO GOOD. So just go with your gut because whatever you order is going to be great.  Drink: Great wine list. They have great wine specials throughout the week - Arizona Wine Sunday's (1/2 off all bottles of local AZ wines) and BottleShock Wednesday's (they open \"special\" bottles that you can't typically get by the glass but you can that night!) ; \"Social Hour\" (their take on Happy Hour daily 5-6:30 pm... $5 glasses of wine, $7 signature cocktails, $4 draft beers, and $5 appetizer favorites at the big community table and bar area).  Service: 5-star... always. Can't say anything bad about it.  Also, I love that 90% (guesstimate) of their menu is or can be modified to be gluten free... WIN!!!

One girl who sat at a table next to us, was not only \"severely allergic to gluten, seriously\" but also couldn't eat corn or rice, was also treated to kindly (I would have pushed her out the door for not calling ahead due to her many other requests and finding this out before coming to ANY restaurant) and also went above and beyond to ensure a meal could be accommodated to her liking (I rolled my eyes, quietly, at her).   This is a great place and I would come here again!",

Not recalling the menu, I was pleasantly surprised to see the eclectic and interesting offerings.  I decided on an appetizer (shrimp, sausage & creamy grits) and the cream corn soup while my spouse decided on a more traditional entree': the short ribs.  Neither of us were disappointed and, in fact, were very satisfied with the blend of flavors.  Oh, I forgot to mention the icing on the cake: we split a piece of Fig & Pecan pie which was a nice, savory finish to our meal.",

Now, every appetizer and meal that has been served to my table has been spot on.  The Chicken and stuffing is amazing; the burger was Spectacular, and don't even get me started on the Bacon Biscuits......I mean BACON BISCUITS!  These are also commonly referred to as crack! And for dessert, Chocolate Covered Bacon Smores!  I mean, come on!    As far as the location itself, I love it.  The design flows well but is very modern and elegant.  The ambiance is perfect for a night out.  Needless to say, i love this place and hope you all try it!",

I wish that their menu was a little bit bigger because there weren't that many items on the menu.   I had a hard time finding the place since only half the sign was lit up. The service was good but I think the food is a bit overpriced.",

Nice that they have OpenTable reservations - easy to get a spot and we had a really top-notch dinner.  Enjoyed: - Curry Butternut Squash Soup (special) - delicious / spicy, but just a bit thick - Daily deviled egg special - Sweet something on delicious something with something cheese...  well, just awesome. - Mussels - served with rice in a tomato broth (a bit like paella).  Odd, but really good.  Others at the table had the tomato soup which was great as well as the sea bass (weird 80's taro sauce plating thing, but otherwise really good).  Also one of us had the vegetarian meal which was good (beets and potatoes and carrots).  Waldorf salad and Mac & Cheese also looked delicious.  Great service, warm atmosphere and and really reliable food.  Thanks guys!!",

It's a bit of a drive from my sister's place in Peoria, but with $100 to spend, we figured we would invite a couple others to dine with us.   The menu I found online was different than the one they actually were offering - the host explained their menu changes quarterly with different offerings depending on the season, etc. They use a lot of local ingredients.  The food was delicious. I had a salad, but two of my companions had the burger, which was probably the best burger I've ever eaten. The beef was obviously very fresh and it had a slightly smoky flavor. The brioche bun added to the melt-in-your-mouth texture. I wish I had gotten the burger but I just wasn't that hungry.  I had the veggie chop salad with lots of fresh veggies and a tangy champagne dressing. Quite good. The others had the cast iron chicken which consisted of a 1/2 chicken (minus the wing) over bacon stuffing with mixed vegetables. The sauce was extremely delicious and made an otherwise simple chicken dish very tasty.  The space was airy and lovely, not pretentious, and the servers were knowledgeable and very friendly.  Dinner for five came to just under $100; this is not a cheap place but if you like simple, good food it's worth checking out. Especially for their burger!",

Soup and grilled cheese are good just like it is always supposed to be - in your kitchen, at a picnic or in a restaurant. It's soup and a sandwich not an exotic paella. Short ribs were over cooked - a bit mushy but flavorful. Competent food but I wouldn't drive out of my way.",

    "text": "About time I ate here. Long before it opened the owner started a Facebook page and some of my friends liked it so I did too. So I got follow along as he put the place together and after he opened enhanced the outdoor seating. Nothing seemed to present a reason to go here. Last night that got fixed.  We arrived well before our reservation but without hesitation they were able to seat us. They were pretty much packed the whole time we were there. Service and food were slow like they were short servers which surprised me as a friend of mine's daughter worked there for a while and they would always staff for a full house so no server had too many tables but the complaint was: on a slow night they did not make much in tips. So the slow service and the noise level are what brought it down to below 4.5, but not by much.  Our server was actually very pleasant and knowledgeable. From all the hype I expected no flaws in the food or the presentation and that is what we got. For an appetizer we got the mac and cheese and we both decided it was filling enough we could have gone home at that point. But onward we went. I had the short ribs and my dining companion got the petite chicken and of course we shared back and forth. She took 1/2 her chicken home and I left about 4 bites of mashed potato on the plate. At this point we were stuffed to uncomfortable but several of the deserts looked good. Unfortunately they were sold out of peach cobbler and I like just about everything peach. We shared the chocolate bacon s'mores  and they were great.  Definitely a place I would return to and reccomend.",

Now on to the greats:  Cast Iron Chicken with cheddar bacon biscuit dressing. This dish you have to eat everything in one bit meaning chicken and dressing on every forkful.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here last week for Valentine's Day. Unfortunately since we made reservations too late, we couldn't get a table until 9:30 pm. Side note: More restaurants should allow online reservations. Finding a table was a breeze.  After enjoying a cocktail at Crudo, we arrived about 15 minutes early to Beckett's Table. Much to our surprise we were immediately sat.   The inside of the restaurant is very chic & trendy, with low lighting and music playing at not too annoying of a volume. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. My boyfriend ordered Miss Katie's Pimm's Cup and I ordered a Flinn's Dilemma because well... it had both Jameson & Bushmill whiskeys. How can I pass that one up? Our cocktails were delicious although my boyfriend noted that mine tasted much better. It might just be a preference for whiskey over vodka though. :)  For an appetizer, we really wanted to try the fried deviled eggs. I love deviled eggs and was all about trying them fried. However, much to our chagrin they were sold out. Boo. We ordered Brussels sprouts instead. They were quite tasty, but could have been a little more caramelized? Despite my total hatred of mustard anything, the dressing was a nice addition.   For our main course, my boyfriend ordered the short ribs and I ordered the butternut squash risotto. We both really enjoyed our meals. I love butternut squash anything so I'm easy to please in that area.   Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience. Service was top notch and our food was delicious. I would definitely come back again and think this is a great choice for a date night.",

The starters were impressive, the vegetarian enchiladas were dry and not up to even the simplest of pallets but the server wouldn't of known that since she was not interested. They were out of Creme brulee which we didnt learn until after she took our choices and tried to deliver them to the kitchen leaving us with two chocolate options which three of us were not interested in. Again the server was very a matter a fact, get over it. When asked if we could try another desert from the menu she turned us down. When we asked the check be split 3 ways (three couples) she shamed us with the \"we dont split checks).

    "text": "Make that two visits and two outstanding experiences at Beckett's.  The menu, the decor, and the service.  All spot on.  I took a date here after work on Friday.  I knew this place was usually pretty busy so I made sure to grab a reservation on OpenTable just to be sure.  The restaurant is on the east end of a super busy shopping and dining complex on Indian School Road.  Tonight we had to park almost two blocks away the area was so busy.  The restaurant itself has a modern interior and feels very open and roomy without being cavernous. They have a decent sized patio out front as well, though we opted for inside tonight since its starting to get toasty outside.  We skipped the appetizer menu this time, but I do highly recommend the grits and sausage appetizer.  The grits are super creamy and the sausage is locally sourced through Schreiner's in Phoenix and adds a nice kick.  Opens up your taste buds immediately.  The last time I was here I had the cast iron chicken dish with biscuit and bacon stuffing which was excellent.  Tonight I went for arguably their most signature dish.  Their short ribs.  Wow, talk about tender.  They slow cook it all day and serve it with a red wine reduction.  The meat practically melts in your mouth.  The waiter also highly recommended we try a side of their bacon cheddar biscuits.  You catch the bacon and cheese notes in the biscuits immediately, but the real star of this side is the apple butter they serve it with.  That butter would taste good on almost anything.  For dessert, I've had their famous chocolate bacon dipped s'mores before (a must try if you're a first timer), but tonight we decided to try their homemade fig and pecan pie.  Admittedly, I'm not a pecan pie fan, but this was nothing like any pecan pie you've seen or tasted.  You really taste the figs more than the pecans as the pecans are essentially grinded down into smaller pieces.  But what makes this dessert is the ice cream they serve it with.  Its a mix of cream cheese, vanilla and lemon zest that immediately catches you by surprise.  Complements the pie slice very well.  Altogether, two glasses of wine, two short rib entrees, an order of bacon cheddar biscuits, the pie, plus the tip, set us back about $95.  The short rib dish is pretty much the most expensive entree on their menu which pushed the price higher.  Sooo worth it, but the rest of their entrees are cheaper.  One thing I have to especially compliment them on is the speed with which we were served with each course.  Even on a busy night like tonight, we never had to wait long for any of our food and our waiter was very attentive without being intrusive.  If you want to try this place out for a little cheaper, Beckett's is a regular participant in Arizona Restaurant Week.  For $30/person you can have a three course meal here including a free glass of wine during the Restaurant Week promotion.  As I said it can get busy for dinner so I would recommend using OpenTable or just calling in a reservation just to be sure.  Will absolutely be back here again at some point.  And I'm very much looking forward to trying Justin Beckett's newest restaurant concept on 3rd Ave and Camelback in Phoenix called Southern Rail when it opens in mid 2014.",

But they were out of the short ribs and we got the last shepard's pie even tho we wanted two orders.  I understand there was an issue getting their short rib delivery but then enough of the other beef entree should be available, since it is a limited entree menu.  We were there at 8:30 pm on a Sat so maybe that's too late.  However, we did enjoy our dinners - hubby loved the scallops, the shepard's pie was very flavorful, my bass was ok.  We like the biscuits and ask for the bread as I did enjoy the whole wheat roll.  All went well with a nice bottle of Riesling for $33.  We skipped appetizers because we wanted dessert but alas we were again too full but I did get a fig/pecan pie to go...sooo good with the cream cheese ice cream...yumm!",

    "text": "It's restaurant week, and I finally had the opportunity to try Beckett's Table. Having read so many good reviews, I decided to book a reservation here to take my mom out.  I carefully inspected their prefixed menu, and was elated to see that they offered a vegetarian option.  For our main course, my mom tried the chicken meatballs which, unfortunately, was not a fan because of the onions and peppery taste. (I guess she didn't look at the menu)  I ordered the vegetable salad with champagne  vinaigrette, which was fine.  For the main course, mom got the meat loaf, and I ordered the vegetarian mushroom lasagna (their vegetarian option).  My mom said the entree was delicious and not greasy unlike other meat loafs she had tasted.  My lasagna was decent, but I wish the vegetarian option wasn't a pasta dish.   I've been eating pasta this whole week, so I was sort of  sick of it.  A Total overload!  Now as far as the service goes, it was great. Our server Michael did a great job explaining the menu, and the waiter's assistant kept our beverage full.  My only fret is where they sat us. They gave us a table smack in the center of the restaurant, so regrettably, I could not provide pictures. Next time I'm going to ask for  patio seating now that the weather is getting cooler.",

Our server was stellar, making recommendations and providing a sample of a beer I was interested in ordering but was on the fence about it. The roasted pepper soup was INSANELY good, as was the osso bucco. For dessert, our faves were the cream brulee and the s'mores. The freshly made graham crackers and marshmallows were so spot on good. Can't want to go back and try more!",

    "text": "Mediocre food and decent service.  I will note, the pecan pie is excellent.  The fiance and I just came from Crudo - Crudo was a \"1 out of 5 star\" type of place and we were looking to salvage the night by coming to Beckett's Table.  Meal: We had the macaroni and cheese, creme brulee, and the pecan pie.  I had a cup of coffee and the fiance had a glass of wine.  Taste:  The macaroni and cheese was mediocre.  It was filling but it was a step above the boxed stuff.  The creme brulee was the worst I ever had.  However, the pecan pie with the citrus ice cream was maybe one of the top 10 desserts I have ever had.  Had it not been for the pecan pie, this would have been a very poor performance.  5 out of 10.  Value:  Meh.  Could be worse.  The portions were on the line of being adequate and being too small.  3 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  I am really torn on this category.  Walter, the gentlemen who helped kept water glasses filled, was awesome.  Polite, friendly, and extremely helpful.  Our waitress, on the other hand, was disorganized.  She was friendly but our order was bungled and she forgot to bring out the wine at first - had to be reminded that we ordered it.  6 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  It was a very nice atmosphere.  Comfortable and inviting.  We sat outside and it was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle.  4 out of 5.  Overall:  I would only go for the pecan pie only.  The rest is so-so and not worth the drive from the East Valley.  18 out of 30 points, 2 out of 5 stars.",

We started with a butchers board/cheese platter which was great. They had some homemade pickled and smoked stuff on there which was awesome. Unfortunately, I would have to say that was my favorite part of the meal.  Boyfriend had the speitzle (sp?) and pork chop. The speitzle had no flavor. The pork was ok. I had a shrimp and grits dish where the shrimp were in a cajun style sauce and the grits on the side. My dish was much better than boyfriends but they didn't give you many shrimp, but the sauce was ok. The grits were eh...I had to salt them, and if you read some of my other posts from other places, I don't salt my food so for me to walk into a restaurant and have to salt food.   The pricing was a bit high for what else you could get in the area that was a lot better. I don't want to knock these guys too hard because its clear they have a cool concept, but I think it needs to be fine tuned a bit. I would go back here for sure and spend the money on some wine and an app, but might be reluctant to go on a whim and get an entree again.",

Let's just say I was not let down, we went on a Sunday night and the place was packed. Apparently its was half priced Arizona wine night, which is a pretty large draw for BT. My wife and I ended up sitting outside on Dec. 30th and we very comfortable crazy enough. The heaters kept us warm on a rather cold night, the enclosed sides of the patio also aided the warmth.   As for the food it was top notch, I couldn't have asked for a better dinner that night. Between the 2 of us we had the Cast Iron chicken, Fingerling Potatoes, Mac & cheese, and their app board. I also accidentally ordered a whole bottle of wine (long story), which ended up being great and I was able to re-cork it to take home.   I know that I will go back at some point and I do want to experience the main indoor dining area before I can up my rating to 5 stars. Service was amazing, food was great, and atmosphere was spot on. All in all I cannot wait to make the trek back and enjoy another phenomenal evening at Beckett's Table.",

My wife ordered the short ribs and I ordered the Pork Oso Buco.  This ended up killing the conversation and we were both enthralled in eating our food and savoring each bite.  The only knock I have was on the desert which left us underwhelmed.  We ordered the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores which, after the great meal we had, didn't quite have the same impact as the apps and entrees.  The wait staff seemed to be slightly occupied but for the most part we felt taken care of.  It is definitely worth going to - but maybe try a different dessert.",

Review Went to Beckett's Table for a double date on a Thursday night. The restaurant has a nice modern but simple look and consists of a bar, dining area, and a patio that wraps around the exterior of the building, If you are into wine then I would highly recommend giving this place a try as the selection is huge. The menu is mostly comfort food with an old school twist. Our table ordered the Grits, French Soup, Carrot Salad, and Bacon Biscuits for appetizers. All of the appetizers were great, but the Bacon Biscuits were especially good. Our main courses consisted of Salmon, Beef Bourguignon, and their Cheese Burger. The food was excellent and our waiter was really friendly. I will definitely be going back again.",

    "text": "Went here for restaurant week. It was $30 per person for an app, entree and dessert. I know it was a 'deal' but $30 for dinner for one person is not cheap. And given the very, very limited choices for the deal I did expect normal sized portions. They were small and I left hungry.   I had some potato soup that tasted ok. Nothing amazing or anything. It was luke-warm in a boiling lava hot, very shallow bowl, so half the time was spent trying to figure out how to tilt the bowl to get a spoonful without blistering my fingers. I think they were hoping the super hot dish would heat up the soup. It did... kinda. Some bites were barely warm and some bites burnt my tongue.   For my entree I had the salmon. It was overcooked, dry and crunchy around the edges with zero seasoning. It was one of the most bland things I've ever eaten. It was sitting on some weird avocado puree which also had no flavor. The tiny side salad was good.... quinoa and a lemon vinaigrette dressing with arugula.   The dessert was an apple bread pudding which was dry and tiny. About 4 bites. It did taste good though, I just wish I wasn't still hungry after $30 worth of food.   The service was good, and almost over the top. The water glasses, like the potion sizes, are tiny, so every time I would take a sip the bus boy would be right there topping it off. Every time. It was weird. Maybe if their water glasses were larger than 8 oz (literally), my glass wouldn't look half empty after one sip.   I'll not be returning.   The only saving grace was the ambiance of the place. It was warm and cozy.",

I was able to secure a reservation for BT's 1 year birthday celebration and everything was amazing.  I was impressed with how well they handled the crowd (it was a Thursday night and it was packed!).  Service did not suffer, nor did the food.  This time my friend and I shared the grilled cheese and tomato soup appetizer...that in and of itself was a meal and it was oh-so good.  However, I couldn't resist ordering an entree and this time selected the salmon.  It was by far the best piece of salmon that I've had in ages.  Perfectly prepared and cooked.  Not too dry or overcooked.  No other word to describe it but perfect.  I had the creme brulee for dessert and it was yummy as well!",

    "text": "I ate there last night and it was fantastic!  I had been watching and waiting for their opening, and happened to catch their opening night!    I was by myself, so I sat at the bar.  And, one of the first things I always take notice of, is how quickly a bartender a) acknowledges me, and b) takes care of me - And both were completed very promptly!  Moreover, they were extremely friendly.  As a matter of fact, each and every person behind the bar made sure I was welcome and happy throughout my meal.    Of course, it was their opening night, so they may have been on their best behavior..  But, I hope they great service continues - It's a huge pet peeve of mine!    The second thing I always do is get a feel for the place as I have my drink and wait for my meal.  And, it's a very warm, open-air and friendly place.    The warmth comes from the dark brown colors they chose throughout the place. but they also kept the lights down low, without making it too dark.  And, they exposed some of the original brown brick from the building, so it gives you a older, main street, neighborhood feel.  They also did a great job opening up the ceiling and exposing the original wooden beams.  This really adds to the warm feeling in the whole space - It's very open, yet remains very warm.    Unfortunately, many of the open-air restaurants these days are far too noisy, because they have concrete floors and metal ceilings that bounce and amplify the sound.  And, although they do have concrete floors, they have some kind of fabric on the ceiling, that absorbs much of the sound.  So there's a nice buzz in the place..  Kudos for not following everyone else's \"warehouse\" feel with the metal ceiling - although I don't mind the look, most places are far too noisy to have a normal conversation.    Regarding my meal.  The whole menu looked great - I could have absolutely eaten everything on their menu.  But, I wasn't really that hungry.  So, I ordered the Lobster Enchilada appetizer as my meal, and it was DELICIOUS!!!  5 stars for sure!  Then I ordered the Pecan and Date pie for dessert, and it was probably the best pecan pie I ever had.  Not that I order pecan pie very often, but it was recommended by one of the bartenders, and it was reeeeeally really good!      So, I will definitely be back to try more of the menu, and enjoy the great service!",

That is great attention to detail that overflows into the decor, food and service. I love to see a small menu featuring fresh local food. Although the Osso Buco was only average the accompanying spaetzle was superb, slightly crunchy and flavorful. The Syrah from Cote Du Rhone area of France was a worthy accompaniment. The steamed white Bass was light, delicate yet sensational. Served over a bed of fresh, seasonal organic vegetables, the effect was delightful. Approx $18 each. Then the dessert. The award winning fig and Pecan Pie was creatively paired with a citrus ice cream. And the choc covered bacon and s'mores, with home made marshmallows, caramel, graham crackers and whipped peanut butter (like ice cream) was to die for. Only $6 each. Definitely worth going. Great for dates, special occasions, group of friends. Smart casual. PS. See how many pigs you can see hidden around the place :)",

There is also a nice bar. I was really impressed by everything that we had. They have a great deal after 8:00pm on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday that consists of a half-pitcher of wine and their noshing board for $25...GREAT value. We also had Brussels Sprouts and Chicken Meatballs both of which were great. The Chicken Meatballs are served with a spicy marinara that I swear has a touch of cumin that gives it a slight curry taste-DELICIOUS!!! For my entree I had what is probably the BEST Shepherd's Pie I've ever had. The beef was so perfectly prepared that it was tender and delicious while the tips of the beef were so slightly crisped it really was blissful and euphoric to consume it. I was also able to try the short rib which was equally tender and flavorful as well as a damn good pork chop (which was their special) considering that I am not a fan of pork. This pork chop was tasty and moist, not dry the way pork chops can be. Their Macaroni and Cheese is good with little bits of bacon. For dessert we had Death By Chocolate and Pumpkin Creme Brulee. the Creme Brulee tasted like silky pumpkin pie minus the crust. Death by Chocolate is a creamy chocolate pudding topped with whipped cream and a chocolate cookie. Hearty is probably the best way I can describe my meal here and the entire evening was enjoyable. The service was attentive and enthusiastic-maybe a little too enthusiastic as I felt like I had ADD when the entrees with their amazing local ingredients were being described to me. But considering how awful service can be in some places, it is refreshing to see servers who have such passion and pride in the food they are serving.  I highly recommend Beckett's Table for an outstanding meal, reasonable prices, good service and an overall great experience dinning out. I think I may go back next week.",

I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices! It's just a matter of time, and I will be back for an evening meal! Speaking from living in the Arcadia area, this is just the restaurant we need in the area--a nice community restaurant with pleasing food! If you are looking for a nice dining experience, this is the place for you!",

    "text": "Finally Becketts Table has open their doors and man, it was absolutely worth the wait.  First of all the ambiance is warm and inviting. The open kitchen works perfectly in this space, the servers are so helpful, the warm color scheme gives you that homey feel and the space itself has that rustic yet modern look, I love the exposed beams.  When we were seated our server, our super server Dave came by and gave us a few suggestions on what he thought were the best items to try on our first time in. Amazing suggestion and we took him up on almost every one. But wait, I'm getting ahead of my self, first I must note on the drinks, my guy and I each tried two, I started with the AZ Farmhand, gin, lemonade, ginger and soda, and wow Ive never been a big gin drinker but I think I may have been converted. Then I had the Mornin' sunshine, again awesome, I love that they use emergency vit-c, very creative, my guy had Miss Katies Pimms Cup, that was ridiculously refreshing with a long slice of cucumber in the glass, later he had the Legend City, I didn't try that one but he absolutely loved it.  OK now on the the food... we started with the creamy grits & spicy andouille sausage, wow that was the best appetizer I think Ive ever had, I honestly wish I had some sitting in front of me right now. Then I had the beef bourguignon shepherds pie, super flavorful, rich and delicious, my main squeeze had the mussels and again amazing, the broth was perfect for bread dipping. We were pretty full after our meal but I am coming back next week to try the dessert, the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores is a must try for me.  What an amazing dining experience!",

    "text": "It's quite simple ....before we were seated I asked the host if it would be possible for our waiter to give my wife and my self separate check ( we were with a group of 6) The rude waiter came over to our table and made s MAJOR issue that they don't normally separate the check ....However he acted like he was doing us a favor to do it this time ....but next time we dine he won't do it. I'm not cheap by any means but somehow i always end up paying way more than what my bill should be ...Drinks desserts etc. Not only was it embarrassing that the waiter  make such a bid deal of it ...the food was just ok. When I returned home I called and spoke to the owner ..who was rather arrogant and defended the waiter . I tried to tell her that splinting the check six ways (three couples )would have been fine but to be humiliated by her and the waiter was totally uncalled for . Life is way to short to have this kind of attitude ..not to mention how many other place we have to choose from  As you might imagine Beckett's Table will not see my wife again END OF STORY",

Terrific.  The best part of the meal. Entrees included Oso Buco and Short Ribs.  Both OK, but small in portion and taste would not encourage me to recommend or order again. Dessert, bacon chocolate smores was highly anticipated, but fell very short of satisfiying.  Bacon was not crisp and tasted/felt like chocolate cover beef jerky.  The peanut butter was the best part, but was not enough to save the dish. Drinks were great.  Good selection of bourbons and the wine selection was not top line, but very creative. Price was good for the food.   Service was over the top and very attentive.  Without the service, the rating would have gone down a star. All in all, the restaurant was OK, but I would recommend trying several other Phoenix restaurants before Becketts.",

I have to say that it is probably not the best place for an intimate dinner for two.  It is lively and full of young people at the bar but very noisy.  We did request a quiet table and they put us in the back which was nice.  I had the Pork Osso Bucco.  I am still dreaming about it!   I just got back from Spain where pork is king (and delicious) and I can tell you that it was cooked to perfection.   The pork had a subtle sweet flavor that was not overpowered by BBQ sauce as in most American restaurants.  The butternut spaetzel was absolutely delicious!  We ordered the brussel sprouts for appetizers.  I can tell you that this is the first time in my life that I actually enjoyed brussel sprouts.  They were to die for.  My BF had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection.  We had the pear/blueberry cobbler.  I thought it was very nice.  I likely that it was not doused in sugar.  I actually tasted the pears and blueberry.  Our waitress Allison was very nice and patient.  We were not rushed at all.  I will definitely make it back to this place!!!!  (Does this guy have a cookbook????)",

Both of those starters are heaven in your mouth or least they were in my mouth...hahaha... Then you have to try the wood fired mussels and the \"b\" burger...OMG I absolutely love the Houtons and Delux burger but this now is a tie for my favorite!  The mussels are just as amazing.  If you are a mussel fan and you like to dip the bread in the broth you will die!  You will just want to keep asking for the toast that they give you!  Just know if you fill up on bread you will not have enough room for dessert!   I tried the chocolate dipped bacon smores!!!! OOOOOOO--MMMMMMMM-GGGGG!!  You may think that this sounds kind of off...but just think...the salty taste of bacon with the sweet taste of chocolate and caramel and marshmellow...it is to die for...just try it...it may sound a little interesting but I promise you that you will not be disappointed or upset!   I had a miss katies pimms cup and it was delicous and refreshing! I want to come back and try new things!  This might need to become a new place of mine!  I love it and it deserves to be on of the best restaurants in the valley!  I love the atmospshere and our waitress was so sweet and she really helped us pick good food.  But I haev no doubt that everything on the menu is AMAZING!! GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE!!!!!!",

The service was good, no complaints but they were out of the dish I wanted to order :( which was also their most popular dish. I understand how you could be out, but really? You'd think if it's a popular menu item then they'd make sure that everything for that was readily available. Anyways, my boyfriend had the shepherds pie and I had the short ribs. It's was good but not great. I had much higher hopes for this place because everything looks and feels right but it was honestly just missing something. I may eventually give it another shot.

We were greeted warmly and taken to the table. Interesting enough, the first thing i noticed here is the deco, very contemporary american diner setting, yeah, that's how I could describe. The dinner tables and chairs are clearly divided into two colors, beige-ish or dark chocolate-ish, somehow there were no specific color match arrangement or setting, it was a bit random to me.  While the hostess was very nice, our waitress had a I-do-not-want-to-work-on-sundays face, I think that just described enough. My entree was the butternut squash risotto. The presentation of this dish was good at a first sight, but when you look at it closely, I don't understand why the fried almost turned black brussels leaves are floating around, it was oily and tasteless. If you want to add a touch of green to the dish, maybe don't fry it as much so it would stay at green. Overall the dish was too salty for me, and a bit too rich as well....Though my friend enjoyed his shrimp and sausage dish very much.  Maybe next time...",

My drink, miss katie's pimms cup (pimm's #1, ketel one vodka,  muddled cucumber, ginger and sprite) was amazing. So refreshing, not too sweet, subtlety of cucumber and ginger, I could have drank these all night and it would have been worthy of 5 stars, but a girls gotta eat!  After I read the menu, and not only saw but smelled the delicious food coming out of the kitchen, I actually felt guilty for being Vegan. I too wanted to enjoy one of those mouthwatering meals.   However, Chef Justin had no qualms about catering to my needs. I was informed he was preparing something special for me. I do Love surprises.   It was quite a treat to have something so artfully presented to me. (see pics)  Not only was my dish Beautiful it was Delicious! It tasted of the same care that the signature dishes on the menu were made of.  It really says a lot about Chef Justins level of customer care that he went out of his way to prepare me something that was not just a bunch of sides thrown together on a plate. It was a well thought out dish from presentation to flavors. It was my pleasure to meet Chef Justin last night  and I can't thank him enough.   My husband had the Short Ribs (see pics), which he'll attest, were amazing, as well as the Fig and Pecan Pie (darn, no pic) that blew him away.  All put together with stellar service form Cort our server, it was a Wonderful evening that we will look forward to enjoying again and again.  P.S. I hear they will be adding  daily Vegan/Vegetarian/GF options to their menu by the new year. I cannot wait!",

It was cooked perfectly and the blood orange glaze, while a little bit of a sweet shock to my palate initially, really balanced with the accompaniments.   It was good that our server advised me that the couscous would be cold -- I would have expected hot, especially on a winter menu but: (a) this IS Arizona, not the northeast and (b) with its refreshing mint accent, it was the perfect accessory to the salmon.   The last thing I ate on my plate was the shaved veggie salad. It was such a great end to the meal. Really pleasant and crisp with the occasional treat of a yellow beet. I even shared a slice of beet with my friend, explaining: it IS possible to like beets if they are handled well. In this case, they were definitely handled well!   A huge fan of Sam Pilsbury to begin with, I think this meal was made for his One Night Stand Rose. A match made in heaven!!   On another visit I tried the pecan fig pie and really enjoyed it. The cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream was novel for me and really complimented the pie. The crust was also excellent. Last night, we had the creme brulee with shortbread cookies and it was a bit of a disappointment for me. While my dinning companion LOVED it, I found it a tad on the runny side and the shortbread crumbly. Flavors were fine but would probably try a different dessert on another visit.   Beckett's Table is a great addition to the Phoenix food scene!",

Because I am on said broke college student budget I have only really gotten appetizers, desserts, and drinks. All which were to die for.  I first heard of Beckett's Table on local food blog Chow Bella. They were on the list for the best grilled cheese and WOW is that ever accurate. I have the stomach size of a small bird so this is enough to fill me up- the bread is rather filling as it is homemade, fluffy and dense and all sorts of amazing. It also comes with a small dish of red pepper soup for dipping that is impeccable.   My absolute favorite thing here is the pecan pie. Theirs is a refreshing take on an old favorite... as it is infused with fig and topped with a small scoop of their homemade gluten-free OUT OF THIS WORLD citrus cream cheese ice cream. I kid you not I think I dreamed of that ice cream for a week straight after I first had it... so unbelievably creamy and divine.   My other favorite thing about this restaurant is the community table. It's a very beautiful, very long wooden table openly awaiting those who are both impatient and not shy. Since there is usually a wait/you have to make reservations this is a neat alternative. Dining right next to strangers at such an intimate setting is not as strange as it sounds. Definitely a unique experience and not one to be missed.",

    "text": "Arrived back from a terrific meal at Beckett's Table!  Before I wax on, I would like to say kudos to the Becketts and Stephens' on their 2nd opening night!  FOH was in fine form (from the immediate greeting at the hosts' stand; to server Cort's affable personality & eagerness to please, as well as server Travis' assistance throughout the evening; and yet another server's readiness to show me to the restroom, instead of pointing the way.  (An example of four-diamond service, and I should know, since we're given the four-diamond spiel daily where I work!)  When I inquired deeper into the Legend City cocktail's ingredients, Cort offered to have Scott Stephens, the drink's inventor and BT's co-owner, come out to greet and tell me about it himself!    As soon as I crossed the wide-open sliding-door glass panels and into the restaurant, I was in-love w/ the ambience!  It's rustic St. Francis (and a little bit of The Parlor) meets laid-back, yet mysteriously sexy Olive & Ivy.  (Think what you will about these venues' food and ambience, but I happen to love the spaces of all three!)  Really liked how I could watch what was going on in the kitchen, bar, community tables, and the main dining room w/out being subjected to too much noise.  Even the restroom door had a bit of novelty to it- go check it out and see what I mean.  Alright, so what about the food??  Where shall I start?? Let me preface by saying that I already knew what I wanted, having checked out the menu online after reading about Opening Night at BT (but I'd already eaten, darn it!), but I played along and had a look at the lovely watermarked printed menu Cort gave me.  Didn't know if I felt like  having cockails or wine yet, so I asked for the Bacon cheddar biscuits and the Mac 'n Cheese w/ pancetta, please.  Wanted to try the Legend City cocktail, but wasn't sure what \"ricard\" was (and now know, thanks to Scott!).  When Cort came back for my drink order, I asked \"the short ribs (a fave of one of the hosts'), or the osso bucco?\"  W/out batting an eyelash, Cort said \"get the osso bucco; it's my favorite on the entire menu!\"  Sold!  As I waited for my biscuits and macaroni dish, I spied next table's inhabitants (Hi Karen and Elsa!) breaking into their table bread, so I asked Cort if I could have some, too, please!  Looking all around me, at the hustle-bustle of the kitchen and everyone's smiling faces, I knew I was in for a treat!  The bacon cheddar biscuits were delightful!  Loved the crusty cheese topping, and I enjoyed feeling the weight of the biscuit in my hands as I tore off a piece to peer inside-- it was like I was on slow-mo' breaking bread!  (Cue in \"Six Billion Dollar Man\" bionic sound effect here.)  You must order this and smell the aroma!  It tasted heavenly, and while the apple-honey butter was tasty, its presence wasn't needed.  The complimentary bread rolls were also delicious!  Take away the biscuits and leave me the rolls, and I'd still be happy!  Don't forget to mention the mac 'n cheese!  They don't make the pastas in-house, but they are ordered in especially (\"no ordinary pasta,\" said Cort).  The tasty cream sauce consisted of a blend of some of my favorite cheeses, which included asiago, fontina, manchego, and white cheddar.  Crispy pancetta on top sealed the deal.  I may just have to order this side dish every time I visit!  Next came the pork osso bucco confit.  I neglected to ask which local butcher shop the pork came from, so I can't say.  However, I will say that this dish, on the whole, was a beauty!  It came w/ butternut squash spaetzle (so pretty!) and crisp roasted veggies (golden beets, yellow squash, brussels sprouts, shallots, and perhaps leeks).  The pork confit sat atop a lovely and piquant black pepper reduction.  While I thought that the presentation could've been better (the pork itself didn't look quite finished, temp-wise, but I assure you it was!), the textures and flavor bouquets in this dish were very pleasing, indeed.  So what came next?  Could anything else impress me after all I've tried?  Ah, yes.  I ordered the Death By Chocolate, which was chocolate ganache on top of dense chocolate cake filled w/ chocolate buttercream, w/ a dusting of finely-grated chocolate on top.  Y'know, just for looks.  Jeez-louise!  Talk about killing me softly!  I've achieved transcendence.  For now.  I'll be back- thanks BT!",

    "text": "Nice meal.  Nice environment.  Good food.  Not outstanding.  Had the grilled cheese sandwhiches, which were tasty.  Had the chile stew.  It was a bit sweeter than I expected, but still flavorful and tasy.  My wife had the red pepper cannelloni entree, which she loved, but felt like she could have had 150%.  Said it was one of the most interesting combos of flavors she's had in a long time.   She finished every bit.  If you are a vegetarian, it's got to be a must have.  All the above was maybe 3 or 3.5 out of 5 stars.  At least not overpriced.  I saw someone munching on a burger, and will say it looked nice and big and juicy.  But the 5 out of 5 star, return every time portion of the meal came from the following must have items:  Honey Lemonade.  Fresh lemons, sweetened with honey.  Just an amazing flavor... you could absolutely taste the clover honey.  One of the most interesting drinks I've had in months.  Second, the fig pie.  The ice cream was like a lemon custard, delicious, on top of one of the best slices of pie I've ever had.  I would have paid $12 for it, and it was a bargain at $6.  I might just come back for the lemonade and pie!  Do NOT miss it if you go.  I will say that if you are familiar with St. Francis to the Northwest of them a few miles, this restaurant feels like a \"poor man's\" St. Francis.",

Macaroni & Cheese with Pancetta  Brussell Sprouts (i usually HATE these but I actually enjoyed them) Bacon and Cheddar Biscuits with Apple honey butter  Grilled Cheese with Tomato Bisque Chocolate covered bacon s'mores with graham crackers, homemade toasted marshmallow, whipped peanut butter and caramel drizzle.   The waiter was fantastic! Very attentive and quick to refill my friend's ice tea whenever it was low even though they were extremely busy.    We loved the ambience of the crowded feeling of the room. I know some people may find this to be distracting but this was one of the reasons for the visit. We were really hoping that the seating was going to be more communal instead of seperated. I like the homestyle/comfort feeling and will definately be returning.   Again --make reservations.  Also.. I always check out bathrooms (i have no idea why) and these are fantastic. I like the barn door style and may need to steal the idea for my own house.",

    "text": "Everything about this restaurant is perfect. The waitress serving us described Beckett's table food as being \"upscale comfort food\" which I think captures the essence of this place.  Extensive wine list, cool decor, interesting and original menu, reasonable prices for fresh, quality food.  Let's stop pretending I care about my health. This is what I ordered: the andouille sausage with grits (BEST GRITS I HAVE EVER HAD BY FAR. WOW!!), and a side of mashed potatoes. We were a table of six, so we kind of ordered from the whole menu. Other things that were in and around my mouth: the FANTASTICCCCCCCCCC mac and chesse, the meatballs, and the cheese board.   We also got an amazing bottle of pinot grigio whose name escapes me probably cause I had about the 2-3 glasses and I'm a cheap drunk.  To summarize: if you like alcohol, have a hearty appetite, and like to eat things that taste good but are bad for you, come to Beckett's table!",

I just went to Beckett's for the second time --- the first I sent my food back because it was ice cold, it came back luke warm.  Last night we went there for restaurant week. I got the Brussels sprouts for an app and they were so undercooked it was like eating a raw Brussels. Then I got salmon for my main dish and to no surprise, it was cold. The worst part was we wanted the creme brulee for dessert. The server told us that they were out and she was \"told at the beginning of the night\" they were out. Meanwhile, we could see 4 creme brulee orders sitting under the heat lamp. We got the pecan pie which was not good at all. It was cold and didn't taste like pecan pie, it tasted like the fig crust. P.s. Out the door this cost us over $100. The service was great and it does have a good ambiance. That's about the only good thing I have to say. Never going back.",

It doesn't look like much from the outside as it's just at the edge of a non-descript strip mall. Once you walk in you notice a really cool interior with awesome big beams, brickwork and a nice looking bar.   The menu isn't huge, but there are enough options where you'll find something interesting and gluten free items are clearly marked. Iced tea is tasty, but served with an orange instead of a lemon, weird. The short ribs were packed with flavor and if you order with the stuffing instead of mashed potatoes you get even more flavor. Serving size is like the menu, not huge, but enough to make sure you're satisfied. Gluten free shrimp and sausage comes with a separate sauce and you can hold the sausage if that's not your thing.   The donut holes for dessert were too good to pass up, but for $9 you better have someone without a gluten allergy to share them with. Those dense fried little nuggets pack a punch. The best part was the banana pudding underneath each one.",

I liked the bacon cheddar buscuits, but would have liked them more if the apple honey butter wasn't so rock hard and was easily spreadable. I tried to the green chile pork stew and the osso buco and I definitely wasn't blown away by either of them. Neither dish had anything special to it, not to say they were bad, but didn't overly impress me.   My favorite dish was probably the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores. I definitely went out on a limb ordering this, but I was pleasently surprised. The homemade peanut butter was excellent and all of the parts of this dessert complimented each other very well.",

The ice cream was really good, on its own. It had that distinct tang of cream cheese. But if I took a bite of the pie and ice cream together, the ice cream completely overwhelmed the pie. -Our server, Rebecca, was friendly and had a good handle on the menus. However, she took our order for a second round of drinks and stated our entrees would be out \"soon\". \"Soon\" was a good 20 minutes later. The restaurant was busy but when I hear \"soon\", it makes me think in the next 5-10 minutes. -The noise level in the restaurant was quite energetic, which didn't bother us.

    "text": "So it was my last night visiting the parents in Phoenix, and I was hoping for one last good meal before heading back to The Big Apple.  I read the reviews about Beckett's online and figured I'd give it a try.  Let me preface this by saying that I manage a restaurant in NYC and I'm pretty critical especially when it comes to service.  Michael, our server was outstanding.  He took us through the menu and really knew his stuff.  The bus boy kept my water glass filled the entire time yet was very unobtrusive.  Plates were cleared expeditiously and even my silverware was changed between courses.  I got the impression that everyone from the hosts to the dishwashers really took pride in their job. One of the biggest problems I have with restaurants in Phoenix is the ho hum lackadaisical service I usually receive, even at the top restaurants. My faith in service humanity has been restored. Lol. Now on to the food.  Started out with the grilled cheese with pancetta, Mac and cheese with pancetta, and bacon buttermilk biscuits.  The Mac and cheese was excellent and creamy but not drowning in sauce.  The biscuits were very good, but I was not a fan of the orange butter. The grilled cheese was gooey deliciousness.    For main courses, we had the Shepards Pie, the pork chop, and the chicken.  I did not try the Shepards Pie, but I was told it was very good.  The pork chop was tender and juicy.  Not sure where they get them from, but definitely on par with Niman's Ranch. The chicken was moist and came right off the bone with a fork.  I ordered the baked beans as a side dish and was a little disappointed.  I usually expect baked beans to be on the sweeter side but these had a very smokey flavor and not sweet at all.  This was the only miss to me in the entire meal.    For dessert we tried the coconut cake and the s'mores with bacon dipped in chocolate.  The cake with the brown butter ice cream was decadent.  The s'mores had a lot of stuff going on with the bacon and also the peanut butter.  It was good, but not my favorite.     Overall, my experience at Beckett's was outstanding.  Jersey Mike, our server and the rest of the staff did an awesome job.  Overall, the food was outstanding and I will definitely be back on my next trip to Phoenix. Did I mention I love bacon.",

It's good comfort food.   That being said! What makes this place stand out is the service and management. They have always gone out of there way to be a step up on every body else. They always greet us and the owner is willing to come by and chat about food, wine, service, or any thing else you want. The service to me is 5 stars.

We chose the community table. We also paid a little attention to the incoming crowd, but probably saw around 2 whole tables come in after us with a plush amount of open seating getting cold in the dining room.   The staff was a little scripted. A lot scripted. I felt like I was on a Lord of the Rings ride at Universal Studios or something. Okay, I don't even know if that's a ride.   I guess if you really don't pay attention to the whole price/ food equation, then you don't realize how much you are getting ripped off. Sure, I love the down home local farm food just as much as the next gal. That's pretty much all I make at home. I was raised in the South.   But my $9 salad consisted of a few sheaths of bib lettuce, and a sprinkle of other things. I wasn't expecting gold nuggets in the thing, but come on.   The dinner was so-so. Again, if you take the price out of the equation it was enjoyable to eat. Then reality sinks in when you get the bill and realize you are sitting at a community table surrounded by guys on internet dates with fair that you find at a country diner and a bill that rivals that one you would get at Domminck's.   Next time I think we will save the whole dressing up thing and just eat at home. Hey, I can make a mean grilled cheese, too, Beckett.",

I went here with a group of friends and I knew it was expensive, but I assumed since all the reviews were amazing, it would be worth it! It was not. I ordered the short ribs and the sauce was horrible. There was something gritty in it and the taste was bitter and just bad. When the waiter came over to clear our plates, I said that all three of the girls sitting at our table of 14 that had ordered the short ribs did not care for them. He just cleared the plates and brought us our bill. We were all still hungry because we had barely eaten anything. For a place that is super nice inside, has a great atmosphere, and awesome service, you would think they would care more if the food was bad. Guess not. I won't be returning. The mashed potatoes were bomb, if only that sauce hadn't been smothering them in grossness.",

    "text": "Editing my 5 Star Review because of an incident that took place at Beckett's Table.  I'm knocking this down considerably because of the way we were treated the other day. Let me tell you what happened -- it still blows me away. I'll leave the glowing review below so the owners can see what happens due to just ONE employee and the way that person behaves . . .   I had a good experience at this place some time back, and I told my wife about it and she wanted to try it after work. She called the restaurant and asked about what time they would open for Happy Hour, and she wanted to go with me to see what the place is like. They told her on the phone that they open at 5 PM.  We showed up exactly at 5PM and walked in to make our way to a bar seat. There were other people in the lobby getting seated for a full dinner. As we walked past the host, an Asian fellow, he actually turned from what he was doing and reached out to stop us from having a seat in the bar. In fact, and this is the alarming part, he actually grabbed my wife and stopped her from walking further. I looked back and wondered what the heck this guy was doing touching my wife -- how unusual! And then I saw the unfriendly look on his face.   \"We're not open yet.\" His response.  \"But it's 5 PM, and we called. What did we do wrong?\" He just asked us to go back to the door and wait. At this point, I was fuming. There's no reason to grab people and physically stop them from seating themselves in your bar. That's a bizarre way to do business.  Personally, I don't know if we can ever visit them again. I tried to get ahold of them and reached someone, but he didn't seem to care a great deal. They were busy and the last thing that he had time for was to deal with a customer who had a problem. Sadly, I think we're out of the Beckett's Table business in our family,  --- My earlier 5 star review:  My partner and I had a great meal in here at Happy Hour. We want to come back now for a full supper. This place knows that Happy Hour isn't the time to stick out some warmed up cheese quesadilla, but to show patrons your flavors and creativity. I loved the taste of my creamy grits with sausage, but we both said \"Too small.\" I jealously looked over at my partner's plate and she had ordered the Mac and Cheese, and wow did it look great. She was raving. I enjoyed a fair price on my favorite beer (yeah, Kiltlifter!) and she had a very nice Sauvignon Blanc - and it made Happy Hour special. This is a merchant that knows how to treat people. That night, we were out \"sampling\" restaurants and we also went to Mejico down the street . . .ugh! That was the exact opposite of Beckett's Table. The owners there are trying to make Big Bucks on their Happy Hour (meaning we'll never be back) while Beckett's Table now gets not only my Happy Hour visits when I have the time, but anytime I need a special occasion restaurant, this is it as long as the food tastes as good off the regular menu as it did that night. We had a very friendly server and sat at the big community table. A lot of fun, great place!",

    "text": "I was in town by myself and decided to check this place out due to reviews online. When I entered, I was offered the community table or the bar seating...I chose the bar.  The bartender/waitress was fantastic! She was very knowledgeable about the food and wine list and offered me samples of wines she thought I might enjoy. I forget the name of it but it was a German Reisling and delicious!  Water glass was never empty and she was attentive.  She also gave me a list of other local restaurants to check out which was great!  I ordered the bacon biscuits and shephard's pie.  As other reviewers have mentioned, they also offer bread and therefore the biscuits were not necessary. They were good but mine were overdone; I also thought they could include more bacon.  The shephard's pie was delicious, the meat was so tender, and it was very filling!  I was too full for dessert which was very disappointing so when you go, skip the biscuits and save room for dessert!",

    "text": "Very solid place. Cool ambience (casual but cool). The bar area is especially nice looking. They are working out the kinks with the air conditioning, we froze at our table. As an aside - what is the deal with every place in PHX freezing us out all year. Come on folks, pick a comfortable temperature. Not all of us are sweating in the kitchen.  Ok, back to BT.  A few miscues (ordered biscuits that never showed, bread given to us after our main course)...but (and this is key) the waiter was awesome and took full responsibility for the mix ups (as opposed to the typical blame game).    The food we did get was really good. I had the spare rib. Was excellent. - like a delicious pot roast. Wife had the mussels. Really good as well. Excellent grits and salad (the butter lettuce). Had the smores (unique) and the pecan pie (awesome!).  Try to 5$ red wine (the house). Was really good (and I am a bit of a wine snob).   Total close to 100$ (but we had drinks, appetizers, two deserts etc).",

    "text": "I subsisted on rabbit food the week before I was going to dinner at Beckett's Table. I poured over the menu while sitting at my desk at work and drooled at the thought of the bacony extravaganza I was going to consume. I envisioned myself moaning with pleasure over the house made salad dressings...and then...not so much.   I ordered the grilled cheese appetizer and a salad for entree because they appealed to me more than the actual meals. I didn't care for the grilled cheese and the red pepper tomato soup was just o.k. The salad was alright but nothing to get excited about - I like a salad where the dressing wows you or there are a unique flavor and texture combination - that was not the case here. I also ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits - dry. Really dry. My last ditch effort at trying something awesome was the bacon s'more - it was ok. Nothing spectacular.   I will definitely give this restaurant another try but over all it did not impress me.   Atmosphere was really nice, and the service was great - until the end when they forgot to bring my friend her coffee. I'm not hopping on the Beckett's bandwagon at this point....maybe next time.",

    "text": "LALALALALALALALAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! That's my taste-buds singing the praises of Chef Beckett's newest bit o' heaven! I was lucky enough to attend the \"pre-opening\" and was ever so happy. Not surprisingly, because i've experienced Chef B's cuisine @ Canal & Metro. And yes THAT GRILLED CHEESE IS BACK! You know the one, the secret tasty bread, the fabulously mixture of cheeses, with the perfect touch of prosciutto. Winter coat, here you come!  The preview night my friend & I had the chicken & dumplings. INSANE, my friend honestly asked for a spoon so she could get every last drop of the sauce, we had the grilled cheese (see above lalalalalaaaa), the osso bucco.......OMG! By far the most amazing dish,the veggies, the spaeztel (sp?) even the kids menu looks good!!  This was until I went back Saturday & had the roasted chicken, so delicious, so dreaming about it now BUT my dad had the green chile stew which was even better and I don't know how that's even possible....something has to be off....BUT IT'S NOT!! The cornbread that came with the green chile heaven in a bowl is the best cornbread I have ever eaten. That brings me to the basket of bread they brought out before our meals......wheat rolls that melted in your mouth, warm and perfect but not nearly as phenomenal as the cheesy bacony biscuits that came too......  All good things must come to an end so we had dessert. If you only listen to me once, do yourself a favor and order either the s'mores (chocolate covered bacon, seemingly homemade marshmallow, out of this world graham crackers and this tasty peanut butter shmear stuff) the combination of the salty and sweet sent fireworks shooting throughout my mouth or wait, could that have been from the creme brulee? The most perfect custard with the crispy carmel shell.. INSANE!! You thought Phoenix arrived when we got Nordstrom's or Neiman Marcus? NAH, we've arrived because BECKETT'S is here.    Last thing, the service is impeccable, no complaints there. No attitude, actually people in the service industry pleased to serve you and it doesn't hurt they are ALL easy on the eyes. They know their stuff and it shows. Especially, if you sit in the car with the game on, while waiting for your ever tardy daughter, the front of house boss has really long jumper cables.........hey, that stuff is important.   Ok, really this is the last thing......make a reservation because I'm not the only one that feels this way. Making mine for tomorrow now, its been a week and i'm starting to twitch!!   THANK YOU BECKETTS I NEEDED YOU! (and to renew my gym membership~)",
