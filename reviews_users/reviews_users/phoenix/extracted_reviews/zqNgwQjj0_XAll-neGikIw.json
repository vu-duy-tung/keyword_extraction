If you like salmon, I would recommend. I was also able to grab an americano to go with my meal!! Quick & easy!!!! I only wish they were open earlier - because I get hungry at around 7:30!!!",

My friend had coffee and they do not refill the cup. The Vichysoisse was the biggest disappointment--texture was gritty and it was finished with olive oil   I don't know how those ingredients can become gritty. We sent it back and they gave us a refund--$8.95 per serving. The quiche was also bad--crust neither crisp nor flavorful.  We have both dined there before and enjoyed the food previously.",

We sat on the patio which had a garden feel to it. The chairs were comfortable af.  We received our food within 10 minutes of ordering.  Food choices were: French onion soup-mmmmmm.  Very flavorful, chunky, nice crouton, good cheese, good portion,  beautiful presentation. We also got a croque madam.  Good ham, perfect egg, good salt, bread was appropriate to stand against an egg yolk, bechamel sauce and juice from ham.  Both meals were served with a good sized salad. We had an orange juice with our meal that tasted fresh squeezed.  We grabbed a multichocolate mousse on the way out.  Daaaaaamn was it chocolaty, creamy, silky, and portioned right. I could tell that the quality of the food was good. And it was simple unpretentious food. While we were eating a guy came out and asked us how the food was.  I am assuming it was the chef.  This struck a note with me, he asked us what we thought and after vigorous full mouthed head nods from the both of us he smiled, gave a little bow and went back inside.  A humble man honing his craft. LOVED this place.  10/10 from me.",

It was simple.  Egg was cooked well.  Bread with thick sliced ham, some cheese and an egg cooked on top.  Served with lettuce, tiny bit of dressing and a couple tomatoes. I had the baquette with proscuitto and cheese.  The baquette reminded my of Rhodes dinner rolls.  The ones you left proof on the kitchen counter when they are frozen and then bake.  Super minimal amount of meat and think slices of block cheese.  This was something I could easily recreate at home, better for less money. Got a couple macaroons to go for my girls.  They thought they were okay.  This is a trendy item right now that you can get in so many places.  Price here was to high. Did not care for the iced tea (had rose water in it maybe?) and was never offered a refill.  I can't imagine going back to this place.  To many other places to try in the area.",

Do yourself a favor and take a few friends to Merci for a wonderful lunch. Do call if you head over for dinner; they're still establishing their firm dinner hours, so letting them know you're coming during their tentative dinner hours (on Wed-Sat) is a good idea.  They'll take amazing care of you. And try the pastries. They'll blow you away as an encore.",

At this point I was confused as to how I was supposed to order. I went to the counter again to ask if I was supposed to order there. A server came over to take our order. After our order was placed, I noticed that 2 tables that had come in after us were already eating. Our food arrived and was very good. The owner came out during our meal and checked to see if we were enjoying our food. The server never returned for drink  refills.  We finished eating our meals and sat there for a long time waiting for our plates to be cleared and for our check. The restaurant had slowed down considerably from the time of our arrival. There were two servers standing around chatting and one playing on her cellphone. I went to the counter again and asked for the check. The girl playing with her cellphone says she can close out my check and then proceeds to ask me for each item that has been ordered.  It is a shame that we were not given even basic service. The food really was good, but we will not be returning.",

    "text": "Merci was a great find! Most Sundays it's difficult to get into a restaurant for breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised to get in without any wait time. I had the homemade croissant egg sandwich. It was flaky & delectable. Was surprised with the generous two sides that came with it - crispy hash browns & salad!! Unfortunately, the potatoes were cold. The waiter was gracious and brought us an extra plate of hot hash browns very quickly. The desserts looked amazing. That will be for a future visit. The only negative I saw was that one of the waitresses delivered a dog dish of water to a pooch on the patio, then without washing her hands began to replenish water at another table. I'm sensitive about cross contamination!",

Was expecting a larger pastry selection(being used to real French cafes they have a huge colorful selection!) the items displayed in the cases looked old and store bought. Macarons are meant to be in a refrigerated case so seeing them in little baggies on the counter was quite weird. My significant other ordered a $14.95 black truffle burger and it was definitely not worth the price. The bottom bun was soggy and looked gross. I told him to send it back but he felt bad. I ordered the Brie sandwich and my salad didn't even come with the dressing or any tomatoes like in the pictures or like my boyfriends meal. He had to walk up to the counter to get dressing and we never got a refill on our drinks so the service was horrible. Won't be coming back here.",

We ordered a egg benedict with ham and another one with salmon. Both of them were equally delicious. The presentation for the dessert was great, but a bit too sweet for my taste. Cream puff was perfect though. Overall, I enjoy every minute of it.   I highly recommend people who haven't been here to give it a try. I'll definitely come back here again.",

I love lobster and this was good however it seems I'm always disappointed when I get it in a roll. Maybe it's the bread. Glad I got the fries cuz they were delicious!   Server was a bit unfriendly. My friends plate came out way before mine did. Even tho we ordered the same thing at the same time. When it did come the blonde gal that delivered it said \"it takes time to make it\". The brunette cashier was very friendly and made up for the snotty blonde.  Forgot to mention that I got the leek quiche to go for breakfast the next day and really enjoyed it. Crust was flakey and ingredients inside were yummy.  I grew up eating frog legs and they had it on the menu here so I will be back one day to try those also. Come on...get past it...tastes like chicken. Really  Lastly, get there at least 30min before they close or they will turn you away. We saw them tell a 4 top they were closed. Funny, usually in the US if you come 5 min before close you will still be served.",

The owners are amazing and the employees always have amazing things to say about how they are treated. The husband/executive chef will come out and greet people during the course of their mean or after which shows he's proud of the delicacies he has created. You can tell family and pride and humbleness are big with him. I could literally go on and on about Merci so I'm going to cut this short. Food is beyond amazing.

The big knock (-3 points) is directed towards management. We walked in at 7 PM that same day with 6 people in our party wanting to be seated for dinner. It was my daughters birthday. We were discouraged from staying and were not seated. We were told that management wanted to shut down early because it was slow. Six people with full meals and deserts would have been sizable business for this small place. More so, it would have been good Bussiness practice to seat a party that arrives an hour before closing.

I enjoyed the French onion soup and the escargot that I ordered; both items came with bread and salad, so I got more of those sides than I had expected. My dinner companions let me sample the desserts they ordered and these were really heavenly. The relaxed atmosphere is conducive to leisurely dining and conversation, and although they do not serve alcohol, you can bring your own; just be aware that there is a corkage fee. Those who hesitate to partake of French cafe fare because of either the expense or the sometimes snobbish atmosphere generally associated with such places should come and try this delightful cafe.",

They serve breakfast only until 11:30, so If you want some breakfast foods, show up on time.   I ordered the croque Madame, my friend ordered the quiche and my hubby ordered the lamb burger. My croque Madame was delicious! It's near to impossible to eat it with your hands so I suggest using a fork and knife. It came with a crisp salad and it was nice and fresh. The lamb burger was amazing as well as the quiche. Both were fresh, hot and wroth every bite.  They also have a lot of desserts like macarons and tarts. Definitely worth checking out.",

Lovely food, nice ambience and friendly service (although you go to the counter to order). Really, would you expect to find a truffle omelette and Belgian waffle (liege style) in the desert? And they were both excellent, with the omelette served with a small, lovely salad and hash browns. A liege waffle is one with sugar blended into the batter which caramelizes when the waffle is cooked (yum). It was served with fresh fruit and whipped cream. For our second visit we had eggs florentine (perfectly cooked and with home-made hollandaise) and a red pepper and goat cheese omelette (great flavor combination). We were on a roll (pun intended) and also had an almond croissant and an almond and pear tart. Both were delicious. The coffee at Merci also is excellent. Merci has a lunch and early dinner menu which includes duck confit and steak frites, among other items.",

Only one of the half dozen escargots were edible...the rest was like chewing on rubber.  The sauce they were in had no flavor except of oil...where was the garlic!  The bread served with it was phenomenal.  When they say the salad is of mixed greens ~ it's anything but lettuce.  A lot of people expect a salad to consist of more than grassy stuff.  The two-flavor chocolate mousse was not bad ~ but I've had better and a lot more of it in one serving. Also, the meringue chantilly was really nothing but air and crumbled apart with only one bite.  $6.95 to eat AIR?",

Had to check it out because it used to be this great little pastry place that we loved, but then it changed, and it's even better now.  Same owners, same chef, but with an expanded menu.  We were just in for a quick snack after doing some shopping.  Of course we got pastries to go.  We had a couple of orders of escargot which came with a nice fresh spring mix salad that was really nice.  They don't have liquor license, but you can bring your own, which since they're right across the parking lot from Fry's actually makes a little since in terms of your pocketbook.  I also had a bowl of their french onion soup, which was killer!  The owner and chef came out to speak with us several times, what a great guy!  Staff was was friendly and made us feel at home.  This is a great place!  I was really happy to see that the owners were the same as the previous pastry shop and that they still had those amazing deserts!",

French toast: wife's first words were \"this is crack!\". She was hooked on it at first bite. The bread she likened to pound cake, real whipped cream on top (big difference from the kind that comes out of a nozzle), bananas and nuts had an invisible caramel glaze and the syrup was marvelous. I tasted it and I loved it. My breakfast sandwich turned out to be and egg, some cheese, and some bacon on their fresh baked croissant, a salad and hash browns. All come together and form  a wonderful breakfast. Simple but top notch ingredients and preparation. i love this place!",

My go to, the eggs royale, is one of the best eggs Benedict I've had. Only thing is they could add a little more of the sauce that comes on top.

He even have every customer a free almond croissant to take home. It was probably homemade as well. I overheard a guy say his Benedict was the best he ever had.

They're always asking if we want to wait 25 minutes for them to cook. Why don't you just keep making croissants? I heard our server ask two other parties if they also wanted to wait! Don't stop making croissants until it's closer to closing time! We were two hours from close and our server suggested we call ahead so they can set some aside for is next time. Unbelievable.  For a breakfast sandwich, the replacement starch is their delicious French bread. It's fantastic but you only get one piece and instead of it being built like a sandwich, it's a mini omelette on a piece of bread.  I've also had their burger. I asked for medium and received a greasy well-done chewy burger. The fries looked like they'd soaked in oil overnight and the burger came with an herby mayo that tasted nice but was not represented on the menu.   I was going to give this three stars because of the French bread, the macaroons and the friendly staff but the rest of the food just isn't that great. I was also told that my macaroon purchase wasn't the best and I wasn't too happy with that reaction. I'm hoping their dinner specials are better than the brunch but I will not be returning to find out.",

The house-made dressing on both of our salads was really tasty as well and the fries I stole from my son's plate were yummy. I am so happy that we discovered this place and we will definitely be back!",

First time I had the Eggs Royale which may be the best Benedict I have ever had- the salmon was perfect texture and flavor, and the hollandaise matched well with the perfectly poached egg. I had a milk chocolate tart for dessert and took a croissant to go, delicious!   This time I had a breakfast croissant with hashbrowns- incredible! I also had the lavender-vanilla green iced tea which is super tasty. Taking a salted caramel eclair to go so I can't comment on its flavor yet but I doubt I will be disappointed!",

I did regret not getting the mussels with fries, but that simply means I will have to go back very soon. Having a chance to speak French with the chef made the experience even more special. It's so rare to enjoy exquisite food and discuss every detail with the actual chef. I didn't make it to dessert and that was a great shame. These deserts looked sinfully delicious.",

Immediately, I set out to find a French bakery in Scottsdale and to my surprise discovered that Merci Patisserie made its pastries and croissants with the exact same flavor and delicacy as the Parisian bakeries. What a treat!  As an added bonus their prices are reasonable, their coffee is French and bottomless unlike in Paris. Their macarons not to be confused with macaroons are the most delicious and dense cookie  imaginable. Also I tried the homemade orange caramelized onion jam on a croissant and found the flavor very unique and yummy. Next...breakfast, lunch and dinner will be in my future!  Marlene H.",

    "text": "We called ahead on Friday to ask if they could accommodate us as a group of 10 on a Saturday morning. They very graciously took our information and let us know they'd be ready for us. We weren't aware at the time that it was a sort of quick service type eatery (order at the counter and they deliver to your table) however, that worked so well because we were a large group but paying separately.  The food was amazing. I stole a bite of my daughters' croissant and wow! Melt in your mouth good! Not super crusty and dry but chewy and flaky and amazing. I shared an omelet with my mom, which was served with these great hashbrowns (the kind that are crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside) as well as a side salad with a light ranch. All was very good. The veggies were very fresh (spinach, mushrooms and peppers) and the eggs were organic.   I also had one of those cream puffs that are shaped like a swan. So good! Some kind of amazing caramel layer at the bottom that was incredible! My iced latte was ok. Not overly sweet but it was almost too weak. Not their fault because she did tell me they could do a double if I wanted.   What was cool was that while we were seated and being served our food, some of us added additional sides and things to our meals and they were kind enough to do that without us having to go back to the counter. So when we were done, and ready to ask for some croissants and macaroons to go, we paid for the additional items.   The staff was all awesome and friendly. Downside on the set up is that with the paying ahead, I tipped only 15%, which is appropriate for a place like this for brunch. But they were so great, I would have tipped 20% had I paid at the end.   To go we grabbed a couple of macarons. We didn't care for the sea salt caramel but I loved the chocolate. I also wish I had asked for more croissants to go. Also, they were out of chocolate croissants, which was a bummer.   It wasn't overly crowded which tells me this jewel hasn't quite been discovered yet. I wish we lived closer to be able to take advantage of that. :( But on the other side, I'll look forward to visiting when we head up to Scottsdale for whatever reason.   *** I just remembered that I had ordered an almond croissant in place of a chocolate one to be served with our breakfast and they never brought it. ;( BUT I'm pretty sure they undercharged us when we added croissants and macarons at the end, so I suppose it evens out. :)",

    "text": "I am completely flabbergasted that this place has 4 stars. I just spent $40 on a breakfast and coffee for 2. We had to ask for our french press twice after we ordered it, and was given attitude by the girl who took our order when we asked about our coffee. We finally got our French press delivered after we had eaten almost our entire meal, with no sugar. Had to get up and get sugar ourselves. Every single table around us had a carafe of water to refill their waters with except for us. Everyone around us received sugars with their coffee, except for us. AND OUR COFFEE HAD GROUNDS IN IT. When we said something to the girl she tried to say that was how it comes. No. It's. Not. I've served French press coffee before myself and it is not supposed to be swimming with tons of grounds. We asked to speak to a manager and was told he was too busy in the back to come out a speak to us. The girl with more seniority came over to speak to us, the most friendly person in our experience, yet the establishment was too busy for her to take the time to fix the situation with us and we were asked to wait a few minutes after demanding a refund for the $6 French press. We sat and waited a moment or two and saw it was still getting busier. It became very clear that we would be waiting a while for anything to be done for us, so we left with no refund and a terrible taste in our mouths about the entire experience. If your establishment is too busy to put out fires where they need to be put out then you need more staff on days like that to keep up with the crowd and be sure that the quality of service does not suffer. Will definitely not be returning after the poor treatment and service we got. There are too many quality places in this area to settle for bad service.",

When we got to the front door, we were rudely told by the man at the front counter that they were closed and he proceeded to shoo us out of the restaurant.   My husband told him that he might want to change the sign on the front of the restaurant or the website because both list the closing time as 3pm. As my husband was talking, the restaurant employee very rudely interrupted him again saying that the restaurant was closed. I told the employee that we were there to order pastries and asked him if purchasing pastries was possible. He responded, still rudely, that we could buy pastries, but the kitchen was closed.   We ordered pastries which, to be honest, were sub par. Since we did not order food, I can not speak to how the food is. What I can say with all certainty is that I will not be back to Merci as our mere presence was treated as a massive inconveniece.   My advice to the management of Merci, is, you might want to provide a more welcoming atmosphere to your customers and relay the importance of good customer service to your employees. Also, if you stop serving food at 2:30, make 2:30 your closing time.",

He comes out and greets just about every face that walks in. Truly cares about the guest and their experience here at MERCI! Wait staff is just as amazing, a couple of  things you should try is the open face turkey club sandwich, the chocolate mousse, and the coffee is too die for! Great date spot too!",

Don't let this deceive you; a hidden treasure full of culinary bliss awaits!   I've been here several times and the food quality is extremely consistent. The chef prepares fresh foods cooked to order with wonderful organic ingredients.   I've have the crab cake for lunch, served on a brioche bun that tastes of butter and melts in your mouth like a puffy cloud. The cake itself had chunks of crab and was nicely held together without being bready itself. It was accompanied by fresh cut fries that were savory and well seasoned. Amazing!   Breakfast is fabulous as well. There were several of us waiting before 9, which is when they open. As soon as the doors swung open you were taken to Paris with the smell of fresh croissant baking and coffee perking.  The croissant sell out! Once you taste one you'll know why. Buttery, flaky, fresh baked bliss. The French press coffee was great. Enter our breakfasts... The best French toast my mom has ever tasted ( she's 60 so this means something), the organic buckwheat crepes were light, fresh and the fillings so savory and well seasoned, the omelette fluffy and buttery, and the croissant breakfast sandwich amazing.   This place has the best desserts in the area hands down ( I'm a baker, this chef knows what he is doing, it's all made from scratch and fresh because it sells so fast).   The atmosphere is so cute and has a hint on luxury with crystal chandeliers and cute glass dinner wear.   Ahhhhh and you can enjoy the patio on a warm day!   Enjoy!",

The service needed help though, I had to ask the waitress to bring the drink that came with the kids meal (kid is 19 months), and was brought in a regular cup which is impossible to give to her. We asked for a cup with a lid and got one, and had to ask for a spoon for her macaroni but never got one, so we went and got one from the counter. Meals came all at different times. My egg on the Croque Madame was undercooked, meaning the white of the egg was clear, so I brought it back up for a little more cooking. They said sorry and took it back, and I let the expediter/runner know what happened and she said the french undercook all their food, \"but thanks for letting us know\". Hahahaha. The Nicoise salad is not grilled tuna, it's tuna salad. We had to ask for the french fries we ordered. We never got the fruit that was supposed to come with the kids meal. The waitress said the macaroni is cooked from scratch but it's Annies shells n cheese (I don't care but it made me laugh). The croque madame is over seasoned (thyme?) so you can't taste the ham, egg or cheese. My friend found some crayons and coloring pages to occupy my daughter. I felt that my friend was more helpful than the actual waitress. I went home and googled how the french cook their eggs (in french!) and could not find any photos of raw eggs. I see a picture here of the egg on a burger and it's properly cooked so I don't think the whites are normally left uncooked. Anyway, I think it was a bad day and the waitress must have no experience with kids. I do feel bad, the owner was very nice. But I didn't enjoy the meal :(",

The salads were crazy good and HUGE, the fries homemade and totally yummy. Excellent lamb burger as well, and the pain au chocolat tasted like the ones you get in the good boulangeries in Paris. Its strip mall location makes it all the more fun as a find, you'll be so happily surprised! Go here.",

My better half enjoyed her modern updated Croque Madame, and the absolutely adorable ambiance here couldn't be anymore perfect than it was. Duc is quite possibly one of the most gracious business owners in the Scottsdale area, and this small mom and pop establishment is the kind of place that makes eating out memorable and great, as opposed to some routine habit to sustain our bodies. What our society needs is to slow down and work on sustaining our souls. This is the place to do so. The idea of going into another chain automaton after enjoying an afternoon at Merci is impossible and shameful. The staff here are well appointed, classy, accommodating and friendly. The only warning is that their splendid pastry case will be staring at you, and beckoning you to finish your meal quicker, every step of the way. We shared a Chocolate Raspberry Mogador, which was also, like the rest of the experience, perfect; silky smooth chocolate mousse, with a raspberry topping which was the ideal touch of sweetness.

I ordered a Sweet Nutella Crepe while my friend ordered a salad and sandwich plus an Americano.   My order was a plain crepe with whipped cream on the top and Nutella in the inside and was about $6.50.  I think the ambiance and atmosphere is really cute and laid back. We were seated near a group of maybe about 12 people, only to realized that they were actually speaking French! Must be a good place if French people actually come to a French cafe.  Tried their macarons and they are the BEST macarons I ever tasted! I got the Caramel flavor. The macaron is pretty big size, crunchy on the outside, and so soft on the inside. Yummyyy~ They are $3.50 each.  Only downside was that I thought the total bill was a bit pricey. A total of 5 items including tip was about $30-$35.",

You're being fair warned... Just prepare your nose for Subway stench assault before you walk into Merci since it sneakily creeps over to their front entrance.    The cafe is \"cutely\" decorated. I love their bright colored placemats. Menu is to die for. There's something for everyone's different taste buds. I got the asparagus, salmon and mozzarella quiche with side salad. It was delicious and just the right size. Their pastries also looked super delicious in the cold case but my tummy was too full.   They have a square card reader so when you're done eating just head to the front and pay then you're on your way.",

It is BYOB which adds to the fun. I had the scallops with a side of fresh lightly steamed vegetables. Larry had a chicken presentation over pasta. St a table next to us the steak and fries suggested that I return soon. Of course the lobster bisque with a salad for $9.95 also suggested that I return for lunch  Merci is not large nor glamorous - just a lovely family-owned restaurant the serves excellent food at very reasonable priced Hope to see you all   Returned for another pleasant evening at Merci We both had the rib eye steak and fries at I had taken a bottle of Pinot Noir   Always remember - Merci is BYOB - not only do the have very finer friendly prices but the wine is also your choice  Weekend evenings require a reservation. The other Do Not Forget tip:  they open for breakfast st 0900",

Vintage photos of the various arondissments of Paris, photos of the owner's modeling photos from France, chandeliers, you name it.

I\"m slowly working my way through the menu and I've never been disappointed.  The french onion soup is out of control and I've also had the truffle burger and lamb burger.  Perfection. Their croissants are light, buttery and oh so bad for you, but worth it.  They do have different hours, so double check.   For dinner, you can also BYOB for a small corkage fee.",

All in all though, this is a really cute place and I would love to give it another try when I'm back in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I had wanted to try Merci Cafe for a while so I was pretty excited when it was the place picked for July's International Supper Club UYE!  We were a group of 12, and even with Merci being a small place, our party didn't take up all the room, still was plenty of seating. We were set to meet up at 6pm and around 4pm I learned it was a BYOB, which we love, but didn't have time to get the word out fast enough.   After checking out the menu I went with an opened faced sandwich, it had turkey, bacon and melted cheese and came with a small salad, The sandwich was good. I also order a side of fries, they were somewhat disappointing to me, but not to Merci's fault, I am just a picky fry person. These fries where on the smaller size and cooked crisp, but my 3 year old grandson thought they were delish and before I knew it he claimed them as his fries.  Service was friendly and our orders came out in a timely matter. Stop by and give Merci Cafe a try!",

    "text": "Five star company with delicious food. Merci is a super cute French cafe which was a nice venue for the International Supper Club. Thanks, Monica for pulling it together.  I had scoured Yelp reviews, photos and checked the menu online. I was a little bummed that they didn't have duck rillette. When I asked what cheese they used, the server replied cheddar, Swiss or a mixed for the gratin on the French Onion   Soup. So I ordered the Croque Madame which absolutely did not disappoint. The ham was smoky and nicely cured. It tasted like country style ham nicely warmed. My fried egg was fried perfectly sunny side up. The baguette was toasty and had a great texture. I ended my meal with a chocolate mousse with layers of flavor topped with crumble. Heavenly. I tried a couple of other desserts my friends ordered. The baba rum had lots of booze, a little on the sweet side. The layered chocolate with raspberry something was nice, too. I coveted Aileen's hot chocolate. It was sweet and if I had strawberries, I would dunk them in.   Thank you, Chef Duc for the lovely dinner. A huge \"thank you\" for my foodie friends who made me feel so much at home. Until we meet to eat again! To Monica and the next International Supper Club!",

    "text": "Allons-y to Merci! Attended my first International Supper Club here; much thanks to the lovely Monica O. for setting it up! The interior is adorable, with crystal chandeliers and French inspired accents on the wall. The menu is a mix of baked goods, sandwiches, salads, soups, and in the evenings from Wednesday to Saturday they offer a selection of entrees for dinner.  After browsing through the menu I decided to be as French as I could be (Without the miming and the funny little hats), ordering the French onion soup ($8.50) and the salade nicoise ($11.25). The soup came out first, piping hot, with a cheesy mixture of cheddar and swiss on top, slightly caramelized. It was salty and rich, but I wasn't a big fan of the crouton (Which was a tad too gummy tasting for me when it came out) and the cheese (I like Gruyere better as the topping). The broth itself was decent, but I recently ate at Coup des Tartes which has an amazing French onion soup which this version doesn't quite compare to. This version was more one dimensional and thus had a less rounded taste to it. There were also less caramelized onions in this version.  The salad came out and looked like a tub of greens it was so big! It was filled to the brim with crisp vegetables, mixed greens, olives, tuna, and a side of creamy dressing. Looking at photos of other versions of salade nicoise I was surprised this one was so creamy, since the tuna was more like a creamy tuna salad, and the dressing wasn't very vinaigrette-like. I think I would have preferred a more traditional version of this salad, one that was more tangy than creamy. To each their own though!  We ended the meal sharing a rum baba and the special dessert of the moment, the mogador. The rum baba was a dense cake soaked in a light sugary rum sauce. I loved the candied citrus in the cake. The more I ate of it though the more it got too sweet for my taste buds though. The mogador was interesting. I enjoyed the combination of raspberry with chocolate, but the whipped topping didn't really have a lot of flavor and was hard, approaching frozen status in the center.  Overall I had a lovely night though. Much thanks to the restaurant for providing the ideal venue to have great conversations with other Yelpers while enjoying French food.",

    "text": "First I need to say that this place is super charming and I love how it's decorated!  My family and I went in for a late lunch, it was our first time there. They explain to us that at lunchtime you order your food at the counter and they bring it to your table. We ordered our food and we were not given a side option. The bill was 41.00 & you're given an option to tip after paying. This is strange since you have to determine a tip and we have not sat down or received our food yet. The ice teas we ordered were delicious. The food was brought to us with salads on the side for all. My son stated he had wanted frites and then I realize that they did not give us that option. Overall the food was pretty tasty but the family member that order the croque madam felt short changed. Croque Madame is essentially a grilled ham and cheese  sandwich,  covered in a cheese sauce,  baked & topped with a fried egg. Hers was one slice of bread, some ham, 1 slice melted cheese and a fried egg on top.  She remarked the bread was good but it was something she could easily make it home and she was underwhelmed.  The other dishes quiche and a French dip were tasty. Our teas sat empty for most of our meal, they did bring us to-go refills when we were ready to leave. We would have loved to try the frites had they been offered.",

The servers were friendly and the food came out fast. The food was delicious and we thought it was worth the drive from Peoria after seeing it on Check Please Arizona.   This is where my stars fell. There was a couple that walked in at 1:28. The sign outside said that it was open until 2 pm but when they entered the women at register said that the kitchen was closed. The couple did not seem happy and another restaurant I am sure received their business. I thought that was strange. If you want to close at 1:30 change your hours.",

    "text": "Met a girlfriend at Merci today (Sunday). I was shocked that we were only 1 of a few tables and was worried. I ordered the eggs florentine and an almond croissant. WOW. Really, It was awesome! This is a hidden gem! I LOVE that the breakfast is served with a little bit of salad greens too. To put the icing on the cake, the coffee was excellent -- not just regular icky drip coffee. This was some serious, bold, real java!   We had 2 waitresses...fortunately. The thinner, blond 20-something was really not on the ball, however, the other, shorter, Hawaiian or Japanese server was all business! I think her name is Taylor - definitely this girl has a future in hospitality!",

    "text": "I was excited to try Merci, as I've heard / read great reviews.  Went for lunch on a Wednesday with a friend. We met at noon, and there were probably about five other tables sitting down & eating when we arrived. We were greeted warmly and told to sit where we liked.   Our server quickly stopped by & was polite. We both ordered an open-face sandwich, and my friend ordered a bowl of asparagus soup - she was excited to know that it was vegan & made fresh.  It was at this point that our experience turned from being great to 'meh'. We waited for nearly 45 mins to get our sandwiches. Someone (not our server) did stop by and let us know that our orders were under way & apologized for the wait. When our sandwiches finally came, my friend asked about her soup - and was told it would be out shortly. She then asked to cancel the order, as she really didn't think she'd have room to try it after the sandwich. Why they didn't think to bring it out during the previous 45 minutes we were waiting is beyond me.  About five minutes later we called our server over and asked how long their crepes took to make. I'm 7 months pregnant, and once I saw that they had Nutella Crepes on the menu, it was really all I could think about. She said about 10 minutes - so I asked her to put an order in (worried that it would take far longer, judging how long the sandwiches took.)  She came out to our table a short time later and informed us that they were all out of crepes. But they had ice-cream, should I want that. I am by no means an expert or even remotely experienced with running a restaurant, but how do you run out of crepes? I have made them before- you put a few ingredients together & then cook them on the stove. AND there is a grocery store in the same complex, so if you had run out of, let's say, eggs - couldn't you go buy some? I know I'm pregnant and not really that patient when it comes to craving, but come on.  The food we did get to eat was good. The people who work there were friendly, but I was by no means 'wowed' enough to plan a trip back.",

That a special board outside and most of the specials average between $15-$18. I thought that was a little pricey for lunch but went on in.   There were a few people there (not crowded, not empty).  I was seated right away and offered the choice of ice tea or lemonade. They had green or black ice tea of which I got the black.  I looked over the menu and settled on the black truffle burger for $14.  The burger was small, but served with fries and a side salad. The burger was kind of bland and the mushrooms didn't taste like truffle or truffle oil.  The bun was interesting, but the bottom was soggy.  The truffled fries didn't taste of truffle at all. The small salad of greens and tomatoes was good. Unfortunately nothing about my burger with black truffles or my truffle fries tasted like truffle.  My bill was over $18 with tax and over $22 with tip.  My food was not bad and the service was good, but lunch failed on a price-performance basis.  I doubt I will be back.",

    "text": "Overall I thought the food we ordered was fairly good, though it would have been better to eat in the cafe, rather than to go, since the buns got a little too soggy and everything was a little cold.  It seems like a great place to go and sit to relax and eat, but maybe not if you're in a rush.  This could have been our timing, since it sounded like one of the two people working the counter just left for break or something, however the process of getting all of our food packed and paid for took a really long time (15-20 minutes), even though it was ready and sitting on the counter when we got there.  I got the crab cake burger, which tasted great, but as I mentioned all of the juices caused the fried bits to get soggy and the patty fell apart as I ate it (again, probably much better eaten there).  I will say the price of the meal seemed fairly good for the portion. The biggest disappointment was the desserts though.  My sister-in-law and I are really into pastries, and while these looked quite pretty in the case, they all tasted stale like they had been in the fridge for about a week.  We got a pear & almond tart, a mont blanc, and the baba rum.  The pear tart was the most tolerable of the three, however all of them tasted like they had been in the fridge for about a week.  Both the mont blanc and baba rum had whipped cream on them, and the edges of the cream were noticeably yellowed & dried out.  The whipped cream on the mont blanc had a meringue puff in the middle, which wasn't easy to cut through and squished the cream all over the place, and the rum sauce for the baba rum had an aftertaste I couldn't wait to get out of my mouth.  The pear tart had a canned pear in the middle, which seemed low quality for the cost, and the crust was also really firm.  I was sad to do so, but we threw out all three after only a couple of bites. I'm only in town for another day or so, and with all the options available I don't think I'll get a chance to try Merci again, but if I did, I'd make sure to eat at the cafe, and head elsewhere for dessert.",

Also had an Opera for dessert and it was really yummy. The staff: Kat, Nathalie and Elizabeth are first rate and very warm and welcoming.

So far I've tried a few sandwiches and the goat cheese salad which was very good, you could tell that they used high quality cheese since it was so flavorful. They also have a delicious vegan coconut soup, that you can't tell is vegan. Their croissants are very good too. I will definitely come back and would highly recommend.",

The Croissants are flaky, light and delicious, the omlettes and Eggs Benedict were great, and the breakfast sandwich combined their fresh omlettes with a delicious croissant for a breakfast you can't miss.  They use farm fresh ingredients (cage free eggs, organic produce) and focus on quality at very reasonable prices. Also, try their Chai tea latte and expresso, both very good as well!",

Don't get turned off by the older strip mall its in, its worth the stop.  I am fortunate enough to live about 20 steps away from this restaurant. So I try and make it down at least once a week.  My favorite dishes include:  Mussels con frites- Enough to feed a family- no exaggeration. Literally, I shared with my family, ate it as my main course, and boxed up the rest for another meal. The broth is fantastic; I personally prefer a baguette over the fries, but overall an excellent dish.  The almond croissant- INCREDIBLE, they make only a set amount in the morning so you get 'em while they're hot or until they're sold out. Its flaky and light with the perfect amount of sweetness- they truly melt in your mouth.   Quiche with Spinach and goat cheese- simplistic and savory, my only wish was that it was larger. The crust on it was killer- served with a salad with house dressing (homemade ranch)  Eggs Florentine- One of my favorite benedicts of all time, perfectly sized potions that won't leave you hungry or regretting your last few bites.  French Toast - this was good, but definitely sweet- Its a bruleed version so it has a nice crust to it.  Give this place a try, you won't regret. Perfect for a Sunday morning brunch!",

    "text": "Merci? Thank you? Well, actually no thank you and we'll be taking our money elsewhere moving forward. Here's why:  We arrived at Merci around 1:00pm to enjoy some lunch. In arriving to the cute little French cafe, the decor is bright and lively. So far so good. So naturally we would have such high hopes for the meal and service.   Service: Horrendous. It started off okay, the waitress mentioned all of the specials from mussels to ahi sandwich etc. I ordered mussels with fries as it sounds divine while the boyfriend ordered a prosciutto sandwich. It takes her a few minutes to run back and state that their mussels ran out. That's fine, it happens. I went ahead and ordered the other special, Ahi sandwich. Which the waitress disappeared to put my order in. After about 15 minutes of waiting for our food, a different waitress came back and first states \"don't hate us, but we don't have that either.\" At this point, it was ridiculous. Why would it take you so long to realize there wasn't enough to Tuna?? Secondly, why would you include that in your special when you spoke with us if you're OUT? The communication from the kitchen to the wait staff was obviously lacking. Disappointing.   Meal: Finally our sandwiches arrived. We both were starving and hoping for the food to at least be better than the service. NOPE. We both opt out of the salad for the fries. First off, the fries were cold. Like it was fried this morning and they were even too lazy to reheat. The sandwiches were SAD! It's was like a reheated school lunch! Come on!! I thought this is a French cafe....what happened? Oh and while we try to eat our lackluster sandwiches, nothing from the waitress to see how we're doing. ZERO. NOT A PEEP. No care at all. They stood there chatting away.   Overall, don't waste your time. We stopped here for pastries in the past and that was fairly good. But obviously the food and service sucked.",

    "text": "I was going to write a scathing review of this place but I changed my mind when the chef personally came out to diffuse the situation. All has been forgiven and my review score has been based 100% on just the food.  Before I explain what happened, let's first talk about the food.  Their croissants are really quite a special little treasure of Scottsdale. Buttery, crisp perfection. I could have easily gobbled up three of these golden babies.  The breakfast sandwich was a tad salty for my taste but is still a great choice.  The eggs benedict were cooked very well but I thought the hollandaise was slightly lacking. I think it needs a tad bit more tanginess and a little bit more in portion. I actually had to ask for little bit extra on the side.   I can see why locals love coming here. It's a really cozy and quaint place with super solid food.  So why were we so incredibly upset at first?  The group arrived at 10:30 am.   We were not asked for our order till 11:00 am. The restaurant was NOT full. There was no line out there. They simply forgot about us.   By 11:40 am (over an hour had passed since we were seated), we never received our food and tables that came just 15 mins ago (11:25 am) received their food.   At that point, I was furious and the first server I approached had the utmost terrible response to me. There was no apology at all. Rather, she merely responded, \"Well, maybe you ordered something really special that took a long time to make.\" That response made no sense. I ordered a smoked salmon benedict. And timing of the gods couldn't have been better because right when she said this, I turned around and pointed to another patron ---she came in about 45 mins after us -- just got the exact dish I ordered. I pointed to the dish and said, \"My dish was not special. Oh look. There's the smoked salmon benedict that I ordered. That lady is already eating it and she came in 45 mins after us.\" I was floored. No apology. Nothing.  As it turned out....our order was never put in and we'd already been patiently waiting for over an hour.  The rest of the staff was really wonderful in trying to make up for the situation. They profusely apologized and even brought some free croissants. The chef even came out and apologized--not once--but twice! He even brought us out some homemade jam. We gladly accepted his sincere apology and forgave very quickly.   I have to commend the chef and his staff (with the exception of that single server) for taking the time to make it up to us. In the end, it all worked out and I decided to give a review based 100% on the food, as opposed to the experience (which would have resulted in a 1 star review).   I hope management seeks to contact me so that she/he may work with that single server that failed the business. That server needs to be better trained on problem solving and customer service.",

Yes, that's gross but I'm the type of person that can get past that & eat my other food considering we are returning customers & believe the food here is good. However when my husband returned the plate to the counter letting them know there's a bug in the salad very discretely to save them from embarrassment from other customers ordering, the server took the plate to the kitchen with no remorse or apology. We tried to eat considering our 14month old was tired & we were hungry assuming they were figuring something out or may have the manager come out and apologize but nope, still nothing. I could not finish my food more so from being upset at the way we were treated & how this issue was handled ( or wasn't handled for better words) Again, we weren't looking for a free meal considering you pay before you get your food or service but a little apology or something would go a long way. As we were leaving my husband had a word with the server who took the plate back & she admitted she saw it & asked if there's anything she could do AS WE WERE LEAVING so basically she&  management would have let us walked out with not even a simple apology or acknowledgment of the dish. Now at this point he's just as upset as I am as he was giving her the benefit of the doubt. So if you want to feel valued as a customer or not be brushed off upon finding a bug in your food I can NOT recommend dining here. They have lost us as customers based on how the situation was handled more so then the actual bug in my food.",

The coffee here is awful - undrinkable. And those little creamers...? What about some fresh cream or milk? Coffee quality is better at Dunkin Donuts.   Last comment would be that overall back of house/counter area looks like it could use a clean up. Doesn't look like the cleanest place. It's a shame...how about a wipe down of the counter by the creamers and sugar?  Pastries looked presentable, however I did not try.",

The comments below on how service can be a bit slow makes me laugh - slow down, enjoy your food. It is typical in France for people to sit at a table for over 2 hours. We had a great experience however with the wait staff. The chef came out personally both times to greet us and ask about our orders.   I am addicted to their crab cake burger, and I really want to try the boeuf bourguignon. The amount of food we received with our orders (most of us had sandwichs/ burgers and they were served with fries and a side salad) was very plentiful and I was unable to finish each time. They also have mussels and fries fresh in every Thursday - but he only orders a few so call in if you want to reserve an order! The deserts are all delicious and takes me right back to a real french boulangerie.   I love that this little gem, it offers a tranquil ambience that you will not find in other typical restaurants. Great find on our part and so happy it is in our neighborhood!",

    "text": "Four stars for taste of food. Three stars for service and not selling the items listed on the menu. Three stars for price of certain menu items.  The food here is great and reasonably priced for the quality; however, the beverages, specifically coffee (espresso, cappuccino, latte, etc...) are very pricey.  My boyfriend ordered a hot chocolate which was almost $5.00 my coffee was about $4.00.  The hot chocolate was good, my cappuccino mediocre, not worth $4.00.    I feel like I could have had a happy hour glass of wine for that price.    We wanted a QUICK snack after shopping at Fry's in the same plaza, and I wanted to sample their homemade ice creams, which were delicious.  I will return to purchase a pint or a gallon of the lavender-blueberry -- I highly recommend.  I dislike the fact that the last two times I've been here they are not serving crepes.  Crepes have been a menu item for months and have not been available.  Clearly the French know crepes best, so why are they not selling them and why are they still on the menu if they are not selling them?  Please take them off your menu, Merci!!!  I stop to eat here on occasion looking for a little something special and low-key in Scottsdale.  This place is quaint and classy, just disappointed about the crepes situation.  One other comment:  The service is very slow too.  I don't know if this is intended since a lot of European's eat later in the evenings and spend several hours at the dinner table, but if you're looking for a quick bite, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO!  We were there almost and hour this evening and ordered a cappuccino, hot chocolate and their ice cream sampler.  Most of that time was spent waiting on the waitress and waiting on the items to be prepared.  I will return when I have more time to kill.    Bring your iPad or laptop while you are waiting, they have WiFi.",

We were happy to see that the menu was a bit updated but it really was the same great place it was before.    We have only been here for breakfast and it is always good.  The egg dishes are what I typically go for and I am rarely disappointed.  If you enjoy sweet breakfasts do try Merci's french toast.  It is different but different in a very good way.  Their coffee is great quality and honestly, sometimes I enjoy heading over to Merci just to enjoy a great cup of coffee along side a freshly baked croissant (or chocolate croissant...).",

Noel, the owner's wife was incredibly helpful in setting up the dinner for the group of about 23.   The group had high praise for the food, and the desserts were especially amazing. The restaurant is charming and decorated much like the old patisseries in Europe. The chef has an eye for presentation that is reflected in how the food and desserts are presented.   The staff was super friendly and allowed us to finish up our gathering post closing time. Merci is conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale with ample free parking. and although in a dated strip mall, once inside you are transported to a charming cafe straight out of Paris.",

I'll start by saying there is nothing authentic about this place.  The word patisserie is thrown around so lightly around here. It's ridic and an insult to real French patisseries.  We ordered some croissants, coffees and waffle plate. The waffle was 100% frozen, hard as a rock and tasteless. Pretty sure this was purchased from across the street and nuked in the microwave.  The croissants were ok, and is the reason for the second star.  They forgot to bring our coffees and had to mentioned it to them, even thought there was 3 employees just standing around doing nothing.  ( Coffee goes with croissants ) The staff were concerned about our issues and tried to accommodate, so kudos on them.  Unfortunately, I choose my places to go eat based on the food quality they serve; not the service alone.",

It was so good that I asked for bread that I could dip in the soup. The duck confit (fatty duck leg with crispy skin) was excellent - tender, moist, ducky.

    "text": "I came back because my granddaughter was in town and she loves Merci's salads.  We walked in and asked if you could sit at the table to which we pointed.  We were told to look at the menu on the chalkboard because I had to order at the cashier.  I didn't know that they didn't have table service despite being here several times before.  I believe they now have service at dinner only.   I asked a woman server what accompanied the Tuna Melt.  Her answer was that she didn't know because it was her second day on the job.  Then she went on with her business as if I hadn't asked the question. I would have expected to tell me that she will find out.  Nothing.  Nada.   I decided to just have the same salad my granddaughter was having and call it a day.  The total was $25 and change and at that point I was shown the screen which prompted me to select a tip.  Really?  I not only NOT get my menu question answered: I not only have to get on a line to order (like McDonald's) ; and I don't know what kind of \"service\" I am going to receive and you want a tip now?  Up to this point I had received no service so I chose NOT to add a tip at this time to which the male/asian cashier seemed appalled.  I told him that I would tip according to the service that I would receive.  I don't understand what kind of tip he expected me to leave considering I stood on line for my food.  Does Burger King or Jack in the Box expect a tip for having the customer stand on a line to get his/her food?  Ridiculous.   The Caprese salad was ample and composed and not over dressed.  I received no real service other than having my salads brought to my table.  I was surprised I didn't have to bring the dishes back to the kitchen.  My granddaughter is a fan of their hot chocolate for which we waited over 12 minutes.  The hot chocolate wasn't worth the time or the money.   This visit was a bust for me.  I don't enjoy eating at a place where owners/staff think they are doing YOU a favor by serving you food.   Arrogance is what brings people down.  It will also bring down a restaurant because people go out to eat to enjoy the food and the experience.",

Chef personally asked me to  let my server know next time what my temperature preference is.  Why was I not given the option in the first place?  I was not asked on last year's UYE visit either, and that was cooked medium and came out so tender.  Also, creamy sauce was very salty,  but I was hungry.  Frites were perfect!  (Rare do I find perfectly-crisped yet tender \"frites,\" but here they really are.)  Nutella crepe with banana, which I'd RAVED about in the previous 4-star review posted came out without any caramelization; was tepid in temperature; and garnished with not-quite-ripe banana slices.  Message received crystal-clear: my business isn't wanted here.  Au revoir!  p.s.  I was so excited to come in tonight that I even planned to swing by here in two days' time to grab a cup of hot chocolate to gift to a pastry chef that wanted to make amends for a recent visit my friends and I paid to another business.  She'd told me that she was now craving for French hot chocolate after reading about my praise for Merci's version.  I'm sorry pastry chef, but I will not give my hard-earned money to a business owner/chef who has ill feeling towards me, and for what, I do not know, since I posted a four-star review for Merci previously.",

There is indoor or outdoor seating. They have a pastry bar with quite a few unique selections! I got the Eggs Florentine, but had a hard time choosing because they also offer regular Eggs Benedict and Eggs Royal (crab cakes.)   Wow! What a delicious meal! Everyone at my table was impressed with their food. Plus, the prices were reasonable! I will defiantly note this one down to eat at again. They had organic options, and they are vegetarian friendly, but it was a shame there wasn't any advertised vegan options. We left with an ice latte and a smile on our face.  * They had an inviting self serve water station, and one unisex restroom*",

    "text": "I really hate to write a review like this, but Chef Duc needs to know about our experience. We are huge supporters of local businesses, and have been to Merci a couple of times previously. Last Sunday morning we arrived for breakfast a few minutes before their 9:00 am opening time. My husband and I, along with two other women, decided to wait the few minutes in the shade of the patio.  An employee arrived and the door opened to let him in, and then the young woman at the door proceeded to admonish us for having entered the patio area, since \"The plant was put there (meaning in the entrance to the patio) for a reason - so that people aren't swarming our patio before we open\". Her tone and attitude was so incredibly rude, that the four of us stood there in disbelief! Mind you, this was at 8:58, a mere 2 minutes before 9:00! We all agreed that after that, there was no way we could enjoy a pleasant breakfast there, so we all left. A footnote to this is that as we were on our way to another restaurant, I called and asked to speak to the owner. I was told he was not there, but she could help me. I hesitated a moment, and then relayed the incident. She replied, \"yeah, that was me.\" When I told her that her behavior was so rude that the four of us took our business elsewhere, her response was, \"Have a nice day.\" And then she hung up! I'm still incredulous. This is not the kind of experience we've had there before, but after this, I doubt we'll be going back, and I'm certain the other two women won't either.",

He always comes out to greet me and say thank you for coming in too!   Try the Croque Madame, the French Onion soup, and the macarons! There's also sometimes a special on the special board with chicken and a mushroom sauce that is to die for. :) But my ultimate fave is the Tripe Chocolate pudding dessert.

    "text": "I have one word to describe Merci: CLUELESS. The food wasn't bad, not great, but certainly not bad. So why do we say \"Clueless\"? To start with, we've passed the place many times (we shop at the Fry's nearby) but it's far from obvious what they are: it could be a clothing store or a French Bistro or...we couldn't tell from driving past. And no website as far as we can see.   But we saw it on Check Please Arizona and decided to give it a try for dinner. Unfortunately, from the moment we walked in, the tone was set. The owner himself was out front and tried to steer us to the counter...until he saw the bottle of wine we'd brought (they are BYOB). Then he said, take whatever table you'd like...which we did. Couldn't he have asked whether we were there for dinner? Apparently not. Clueless.  The waitress was friendly enough (nice nose ring) but was largely no where to be found...even though she was within spitting distance the whole time we were there. The two of us sat at a 4-top, so did she clear the other two settings? Nope. Did she fill our water glasses? Nope. Fill our wine glasses...even once? Not a chance...though we are paying for corkage.   We started with escargot to share...not bad (good quality snails), done classic Bourguignon style with the addition of a bit of pesto. Came with two HUGE pieces of (ice cold) bread and a side salad (maybe makes sense at lunch, but why as an appetizer at dinner?), but only one plate and one escargot fork between the two of us...couldn't they manage two when we told her we were sharing? Nope, Clueless.   For our main courses, we ordered Beef (boeuf) Bourguignon (better than average even with the store-bought noodles) and \"steak au poivre\"...but she had no idea what \"au poivre\" meant until I showed her the menu: \"steak with pepper sauce\" (which was decent, though short on \"poivre\"). Did she ask how I wanted the steak cooked? Of course not. Clueless.   We could go on...e.g., she couldn't be bothered to pick up the money we left...but we'll spare you the details. Simply said, they are CLUELESS!  We may give it a try at breakfast or lunch, but again for dinner? Not a chance.",

Now the square of bread that was inside the soup tasted odd like old bread. Also the cheese was very strong that was over the bread. It came with a side salad which barely any dressing on it, I believe it was ranch and I saw a couple of cherry tomatoes. I felt like I was eating grass, hardly any flavor. I had to remind the girl a couple of times we wanted our water and not to forget to give us our chocolate croissants. Then she said she only charged me for 1 croissant she didn't know I wanted 2 croissants. Meanwhile I saw another girl asking if she could have her break and coffee. Later I saw they where getting busy and she only had this Asian girl helping her, which kind of looked lost too. I also bought some Madeleine, butter cookies and almond croissants to take home. The Madeleines tasted like corn bread. The butter cookies where good but the Almond croissants where too small and not enough almond paste. Now my daughter ordered the Croque Madam, it was out of this world. So it depends what you like and if it's your taste. I might go back again and check out some other things too.",

The soup was excellent, but the bread was a bit soggy, a little crunchier would be nice. Then onto Eggs Benedict which had delicious, perfectly poached eggs and the ham was amazing.  The hollandaise sauce was between the egg and the english muffin so it got absorbed into the English muffin though but that's ok, it was an interesting way to do it as it softened the bread.  Side salads were nice and cut the fattiness of the egg dish nicely.  Got a creme brulee to go and looking forward to eating it tonight!",

    "text": "Was referred to this restaurant by a friend who raved about it.  We went in a few weeks ago on a Sunday and the place was just starting to fill up.  Wife loved the decor and it was quaint in a cool french cafe kind of way.  Had the egg sandwich on a croissant. Was absolutely delicious.  Served with a small size salad and some hash browns, it was a lot more food than I was expecting.  Wipe had the eggs Benedict, and they were good as well served with the same salad and hash browns.  Croissants were amazing.  Only tried the butter,  but they had chocolate and another flavor or two which I can't recall right now.   Word to the wise: get there early to get croissants as when we were there,  they sold out.  Also, it looks like it pays to know the owner and be a regular. Witnessed a customer come in, order croissants to go, followed by a regular who knew the owner and ordered those same croissants.  Since there was only a limited amount,  the person who had ordered to go and had already paid was denied half his order and the reasoning was someone had \"reserved\" the croissants before.  Sounds a little shady to me.  Service could have been a bit quicker as we sat there for a good 5 minutes waiting to be served,  and then another 15 minutes waiting for our dishes to be cleared and for the bill.   Will be back!",

I got the florentine Benedict and added avocados and my boyfriend got the Italian sand which. Both meals were accompanied by a side salad. My boyfriend said after his first bite \"so simple yet soooo good\". We would definitely come back again for dinner because we have to try the French onion soup next !   Chai latte lacked a little flavor but not a huge deal. They gave me a huge mug.  They have a bunch of macaroons -- we got oreo, blueberry, chocolate on the way out",

Came with shoe string fries but the fries were very greasy & didnt eat them. Very clean & bright inside. Friendly, counter service. Would go again.",

    "text": "I had been to Scratch a few times in the same location, and Merci didn't seem much different.  Especially when it comes to being out of croissants, well out of the butter croissants anyway.  And we were there fairly early on a weekend morning.  Oddly, my husband had the breakfast sandwich, and it was on a croissant.  Separate stash of them I guess.  For breakfast I had the eggs benedict.  It was okay, but the eggs were slightly overdone and the english muffin wasn't toasted.  I'm not sure if it that's just the way they make the dish, or if the toasting was undetectable.  Anyhow, that really ruined it for me.  Not enough so that I sent it back or wouldn't eat it, but I was disappointed.  I did really like the hollandaise sauce, but there was very little of it.  Just a little spoonful on top of each egg.  Maybe it's my American fat ass talking, but I would have liked just a little more please.  Definitely good enough to warrant a return trip though!",

I have struggled to find any decent offerings in Phoenix for years - so it was a kick-ass surprise to find out that they'd sold out, buy a fresh batch was coming out the oven shortly. Ace! It was light, flaky, BIG and delicious. The coffee was good too. Okay, it was a little on the pricey side, but for a once in a while treat it was worth it. On a comparable scale, Starbucks will sell you mush for $2.50. For 75 cents more you can have some gourmet goodness and that will inevitable tempt you to buy another one.   I stayed for around an hour and had excellent service. I really can't think of anything bad to say. Merci Merci!",

The staff was very accommodating and bubbly with the sudden influx of people in the restaurant.  People ordered iced coffee, iced tea and lemonade. Everyone was more than happy with the flavor. The drink sizes are more than reasonable for the price. The large size was enormous so make sure to check out the cup sizes before ordering.  Super cute decorations on the inside. Patio outside if you can withstand the heat. It's covered which is nice to block the sun.  Thanks for comping the brides drink! It was completely unexpected but much appreciated.",

    "text": "Solid 4 stars for Merci Cafe. I've had this place bookmarked for awhile and we decided to pop in for a quick Saturday brunch. The line to order was almost out the door but moved quickly.   We ordered the savory ham & swiss crepes and an eggs Benedict. We recently returned from Paris and the crepe was just as delicious as the many we sampled on our travels. Also, the side salad it was served with had the yummiest dressing. Would definitely recommend this!   The eggs Benedict was fine, nothing special and my eggs were slightly underdone. This, and the fact that my fiancee ordered a lemonade and they poured him a glass straight from a bottle of Kirkland Costco lemonade, made me feel Merci deserved 4 stars. For an authentic French cafe and at $4-ish for a large glass, I'd expect something homemade.   Nevertheless, Merci is an adorable little cafe that also serves lunch and dinner! We'll be back in the future when we're craving French food.",

The macaroons here are good and the flavors are well built. My favorite is the chocolate flavored one.

I also had the open face organic chick salad sandwich that was amazing. One of the freshest chicken salad sandwiches I have ever had. The time it takes to make the food might be a slight bit longer because it's made fresh and I think it's worth the wait. Everything they do is homemade in the back and you can even see part of the kitchen, which is always nice.  This place is quaint, smaller inside but very intimate.

Not to mention, the service was so friendly!   Im totally spacing the name of the salad but it had mixed greens, incredible marinated chicken, goat cheese, red peppers, avocado, cucumbers and a tasty vinaigrette. It was HUGE and so hearty + filling which is hard to find in a salad these days! I'll absolutely be back for this dream in a salad bowl! I also ordered their lavender green tea to wash it down, yes please!   Thanks for a tasty lunch, Merci! I'll most definitely be back for another meal soon!",

The lamb burger and truffle fries? You'll never find better. The French onion soup? Authentic. My friend and I have spent our careers traveling the world and we both agree, we are fortunate to have Merci in our neighborhood. Visit with confidence that it will be enjoyable.

Then another waitress brings an ice coffee which is actually my iced coffee. The first one she brought was actually iced latte that someone else in our group ordered. So the second nice waitress says no problem, leaves the iced coffee for anyone that wants it and goes to replace the iced latte that was actually ordered. The blue hair rude waitress comes back and takes the ice coffee. She says I can't leave it or you have to pay for it. First of all it's your freakin mistake!!! Second, you're just a sad excuse of a human being because you took that drink just to throw it away. Like who does that?! Then she brings us the wrong salad that we didn't order!! Probably waiting for us to dig in before we realized so she can charge us for another salad!! Is that their gimmick?! Bringing you the wrong thing so they can charge you for both when you ask for the correct item?! The worst part that B* never once apologized!! She needs to be fired!!!!",

When I got home, I saw that my avocado was brown and there was no goat cheese. Also, the dressing was ranch. While it didn't say what type of dressing came with the salad, I would expect some type of vinaigrette. The chicken was tender, and the veggies were fresh. But, I was disappointed after spending $12 on this mediocre salad with a missing item and brown avocado. Not sure if I would come back, but I definitely would look at the food before I get home.",

Unfortunately, the salad provided made the plate wet and the bottom of the quiche soggy. My husband had a waffle that was made with the most delicious batter; topped with fresh fruit and whipped cream The major disappointment we had was the creme brulee was separated and had a scrambled egg flavor. It was returned and replaced with a milk chocolate tart that was amazing. The tart shell was firm and layered with caramel and chocolate.  We're excited to try this place for lunch!",

    "text": "Ah I don't know...call me crazy but I can't love this place as much as I want to.  We came here on the weekend for breakfast. It was right after the time the served breakfast but they could see the majority of the people here wanted it so they said they could make it.  We got a croissant and a glass of lemonade to start - both of those were delicious. The lemonade is made with sparking water or something of the nature which gives it a tart flavor without too much lemon.  At this point the service was okay. We were somewhat acknowledged when we sat down but nothing too friendly. You could tell one of the two waitresses was new...it's not a big place so it was easy to see the more experienced one was getting frustrated. Not professional.  I ordered eggs Benedict while my boyfriend ordered an omelet...which was suggested over the egg croissant. My food came out cold with the tiniest amount I hollandaise, I asked for a side...so she brought me a cold side of it. Seriously? On top of my already cold food, thank you.  My boyfriends omelet looked like an omelet. Zero exciting things about it. Personally I would have gotten the sandwich, he wasn't thrilled, but at least it was warm. The food comes with a side salad. Odd that this is greens with a ranch like dressing (which is actually rather good) instead of potatoes or fruit or something more breakfast traditional, hey even a tomato slice like most of Europe.  Overall, I wasn't impressed. The flavors tasted like something I could find at any dinner or breakfast joint. I liked the lemonade and the baked goods...the other desserts looked good but didn't try any. I don't recommend breakfast, I may go back for lunch to give it a second try because it has such good reviews but it needs some work. As well as some better service. A party of six walked in and she said \"I don't have room for you\". No, if you wait for 10 minutes we can seat you. Odd. The decor is cute, a little pricey, and not worth the food...maybe the dessert and lemonade though.",

From the Croque Madame with egg and bechamel to the chicken in a Dijon mustard and mushroom sauce served with pasta (rice was on the menu but the substitute that he made was superb),  the meal was wonderful. Service was spot-on and visits by the Chef (something he has always done in his other restaurants) were all evidence of his desire to make the experience a great one.

    "text": "Great hidden gem in Oldtown! I ordered the breakfast sandwich and coffee. It's made with bacon and eggs wrapped in a croissant, a side of hash browns, and a mixed green salad. It was a good portion, probably a little larger than I would normally finish, but I was hungry today. The prices are very reasonable for the portion and quality. The croissant was flaky, buttery, and delicious, and the bacon was thick cut and crispy, perfect for me. I was a little disappointed they didn't have espresso drinks yet, but the regular coffee was very good as well. They should be serving espresso drinks soon. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict which looked delicious, but sadly he ate it all before I could snag a bite. He said it was very good. The eggs were poached perfectly. He would have preferred bacon, which he's had before, but I generally prefer the traditional ham with my benedict.   The staff is helpful and very friendly. As a nice touch, the owner/ chef came over to make sure everything was to our liking. The atmosphere is good. It seems like it's still a little work in progress, but I'd say shabby chic. It's the same owners and location formerly known as Scratch with a similar menu. Scratch was one of my favorite breakfast places, so I was very excited to see they opened a new restaurant. I was not disappointed. I'm sure Merci will remain one of my favorites. I'm excited to try the lunch and dinner menu.",

I ordered EGGS FLORENTINE and when I told the server I was amazed at how good the plate looked she said chef Duc is also a photographer; so he always tries to make the food look appetizing. He succeeded.   An appetizing presentation helps, but quality and preparation are key.  The poached eggs were warm and creamy with a light sauce over them, the spinach was tasty, the muffin was toasty, the \"hashbrowns\" were not over cooked and the side salad was colorful.  I was a very satisfied customer and will come back with family and friends.  If you are wondering about \"French\",  NO you don't have to speak french, just enjoy some topnotch french style cooking.  This place was once called Scratch,  it now has a new name, but it's even better.  And if you want to indulge yourself try some of their desserts. I can't guarantee their calorie content, but you will enjoy their wonderful taste.  Bon Appetit.  Michael",

It was served lukewarm and it did not have the rich, depth of flavor one expects from onion soup. I ordered the Quiche Lorraine. It too was served lukewarm and tasted like it was made with very little cheese and little or no cream. I also ordered the French Hot Chocolate which turned out to be the biggest disappointment of all. Good French Hot Chocolate is so rich and thick you think you're sipping a melted Hershey's bar. Merci's was not much better than a packet of dry cocoa mix with whipped cream on top. If you're looking for an authentic French meal Merci is not the place to go.",

    "text": "What makes Merci so exceptional, is the incredible attention to quality given to each and every ingredient of every dish. I would eat the hamburgers any day just for the bread alone. The proprietor, Duc, makes all his own bread and with extraordinary quality. Having sold bread to high end restaurants in NYC, I know excellent quality when I see it.   The Croque Madame is another fine example of how every single item on every dish is in and of it's own, exceptional quality. The end result of course is excellence in the completed dish.   My favorite dish by far is Duc's Beef Bourguignon. It's far better than even my own beef bourguignon, and mine is better than most restaurants in the valley. The main difference is that these are the foods that Chef Duc grew up with, and he makes them like they were made for him growing up in France. A True Parisian flavor that can't be matched by picking recipes out of a cookbook.   The desserts of course are in a class all of their own. Duc plays with creamy and delicate textures making flavors you've had before, seem like an entirely new experience. Some of my favorite desserts are the caramel cheesecake and the orange tart. The cheesecake is much more subtle in flavor and much more creamy in texture than what you might be familiar with in other more pedestrian establishments. The orange tart on the other hand, is both smooth and creamy texture, but with a bold orange flavor that is absolutely invigorating.   Overall, what makes Merci so unlike any other place, is 2 things. The incredible attention to quality in every single ingredient, and the fact that Chef Duc makes for us the foods that he grew up with himself, which are a world apart from what any other local chef might pick out of a recipe book or even create on his/her own after years of experience.   It's simply a level of bliss that can't be matched.",

One orders and pays prior to being served. The waitress forgot my lemon and I tried to remind her but she must not have heard me. I asked the other waitress who came to clear the table next to me and she seemed a bit sarcastic with her response. Anyway, I finally got my food and the presentation was very nice. The salad was good and I ate it first then moved onto my eggs. They were tasty and then I took a bite full of what tasted like vinegar. I washed it down with the iced tea and thought it was odd but the portion until that point was good. My next bite resulted in a awful bitter taste that compelled me to spit out my food. I went to the front and told the waitress what happened and said I needed something to cut the awful bitterness. She apologized and I paid for a desert that barely was consumable. It was a lime tart I think as I thought the taste might break the horrible bitterness in my mouth. After I reported the eggs. The response was,\"sorry about that\" , but no concern for my well being. I left with no tip and feeling sick! This is not the appropriate way to handle the situation. I have no idea what was in my food but it was not meant to be I'm sure. Hours later and I have an upset stomach and a bad taste in my mouth for this restaurant. Here I thought I found a little gem in my neighborhood, but what I left with was the thought that I will never return and tell others to beware.",

Still the food is always amazing. No matter what you order you won't be disappointed.  In 2015 Chef Duck actually opened just for us , he was there alone baking.  He made us a lovely birthday lunch and we had a nice chat about tiramisu. I really want to come back for the dinner specials.  They look yummy.",

They have you order and pay and tip before you get your food and then the server never comes to check on you. So, I just left you 20% for what? Tap water and a bad meal. I told the server when she came outside to deliver someone's food and she was very nice and went to get me the quiche instead. The quiche was very good and the salad dressing is amazing. Its just a spring mix and tomatoes though. The boy got macaroons but they were super tasteless. We also tried the chefs special which was a lime tart. No doubt the pastry chef makes beautiful desserts but it tasted like its been in the fridge for a week. The Irish cream was good, not great. Overall, I was hoping to change my review but I just cant.",

Ice coffee:  first cup of coffee:  salt was in the sugar container.  second time:  lots of coffee grinds in the cup.  third time:  the coffee was watered down.   2.  They were out of spinach, out of croissants, & the eggs were under cooked. 3.  Lorriane quiche was bland and super small  We got the last chocolate croissant.  That was the best from the whole experience.  I hope it was an off day, but I am going to pass and try another place before coming back.",

I've tried a couple of the quiches (both of which were very good) as well as a nutella crepe & of course a chocolate croissant. The quiches (as well as the other breakfast items I believe) come w/a side salad & hashbrowns. The hashbrowns are so tasty! They're crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. That's how I like them.   I really liked the crepe I had as well. Funny enough, the one thing I've tried here that I kind of shrugged my shoulders at was the croissant. I mean, it was good, but I guess I was expecting something that was going to blow me away since I was getting it at a French pastry place as opposed to a run of the mill coffee shop.   I believe the dessert pastries in the front counter change regularly, and one time they had this sugary, meringue thing that I brought home and it was so good! It was EXTREMELY sweet, but I loved it!  The service here is friendly. It's a pretty tiny place & you order at the counter.",

The portions are a little small (the open-faced sandwich at least) and the food took a while to come out.  What puts a damper on the welcoming atmosphere of the place is the large sign behind the counter that proclaims their right to refuse service to anyone.  Why is this necessary?  Who are they refusing service to?  I'm not sure if this is some sort of political statement, but it turns an otherwise comfortable, relaxed cafe into one that may not welcome some people.",

Wow ... the cake was 6 inches wide..... it was brought out in a regular cake box and when I opened it ... it was tiny. I wish I had been told it was that sz. And the saddest part was it was the night before thanksgiving. So to late to order else where. And for 70 dollars it was ridiculous.  But it get worse the owner woman got on the phone with me. And pretty much said well to bad the sz is normal for french people and that Americans eat to large of portions and that must be the problem! Not only did she say that I said well maybe they can add some other type small cakes or something so it looks bigger or at least would feed my guest. And she say well you can buy what you want ! And that it is what it is ! Take it or leave it and then had the counter girl try to take it out of my hands. Wow. I'm so sad  not only did it ruin the party but they body shamed my entire country.

I tried some of his and he tried some of mine. We also ordered a leash waffle on the side. The omelette was cooked perfectly, it was light and fluffy and the goat cheese tasted of a very good quality. The mushrooms were seasoned with French herbs, and it came with a generous salad and hash brown potatoes. The eggs Benedict had a lovely hollandaise sauce. The eggs were cooked amazingly perfect with a perfect yolk. The coffee was a local coffee, not too strong and definitely not too weak. We love that they use a local coffee. The Belgian waffle was sweet and reminded me of the French quarter in Disneyland. But the best part of everything was the very kind chef Duc. Not only can he cook wonderful, but he is so kind and answers every question that you may have. He generously offered recipe secrets, and made sure that our Meal and experience was perfect, we will always come back and visit this adorable establishment.",

The Lobster salad is bursting with flavor and Not loaded down with extra gobs of mayo.  Everything I've had is great.  The bread for the open faced sandwiches has a nice crust, is somewhat dense providing an excellent base.  The Croque Madame has thick cut ham and a perfectly cooked egg, the bread brought the Caprese to a whole other level with the deviation from a typical Italian style bread.  The Italian was good but next time I'll order it without bacon.  I do wish they had nice thick tomato slices rather than cherry tomatoes.  My only other criticism is I wish they opened earlier.  When coming right at 9 it sometimes seems like it takes them a while to get up and going.  Today my benni took 30 mins.  Don't get me wrong, I'm hooked and it's worth waiting for but definitely a pass on work days.",

I love all the decor. Initially I thought I wanted to do takeout (which is an awesome plus!) but I decided to dine-in for a full experience.   I ordered the Club, which is an open-faced sandwich including: turkey, avocado, pesto and bacon topped with melted Swiss cheese. It also comes with a small, but nice side salad made with greens, tomatoes and ranch. The sandwich was great and the whole meal was a perfect portioned lunch. I also had to get dessert (don't skip!) which was out of their pastry case. It was a chocolate layered mousse with raspberry. I forget the exact name but it came in a little square container, topped with a raspberry. It was chilled and delicious!! It totally satisfied my sweet tooth. Overall I would definitely come back and bring a friend! It looks like there's so many, even more, scrumptious dishes + desserts to experience!",

    "text": "This place is so so stinkin adorable, hidden and unsuspecting in a strip mall of blandness. Who would ever think there's a gem amidst a Subway, bikram yoga studio and Fry's grocery store? Exactly. You miss it unless you are a foodie following the scent of bliss...And well, I have a weakness for French -  French food, French people, French kissing. Can you tell yet?  Every time I frequent here, it transports me to a time of romanticism that just leaves one smiling. It's never short of cute couples canoodling or sweet hand holding. How can I not sit and soak that up?!?!! If you ever feel alone, just come here and drop the Harlequinn book. The patio is lovely for coffee and conversation and inside draws you in with the colorful placemats adding so much whimsy and cheeriness. You can catch the specials board outside greeting you and letting your wallet anticipate the tab. I think it's unfair to say this place can be pricey when people are comparing it to a basic Denny's breakfast or Good Egg omelette. You don't come here for that.   It is one of my favorite neighborhood spots, probably because I could run home and rid myself of the guilt for consuming too much, if that's such a thing with food. They serve local coffee from a roaster up in Cave Creek so I am already smitten. I will say every time I've been here, they are always out of chocolate croissants. Whoever is taking all of them, you are on my radar to hunt down!!!! Seriously the baker needs to make more than a handful. It's ridiculous that you are out before mid morning. Shameful to us devotees. Hands down the french toast is incredibly uh-mazing. I love that it's crustless and the sauce makes me seriously want to dip myself in it and lick for hours.   What I love is that they offer more than just  breakfast items which makes me such a frequent patron here. Not going to lie, I wasn't as impressed with the sandwich selections, especially on a month where I did meatless challenge. Your only option was the brie sandwich and that was not filling enough. Pretty but little substance and I'm more about content. I can't wait to try the lamb or mussels on my update review so hang tight for that!  It's only short a star because I haven't done dinner here and the service can be spotty. My first time, the pregnant server was such a doll. On another return, I met the server that everyone complained over. I think she's just very French and it's not necessarily bad service. I guess I don't expect my servers to be doting over me but when they do, I certainly take note and tip well for their customer delighting skills.",

Big pluses include a really charming wait staff, French pastries (less sweet, often, than American), and a dog-friendly patio. Quibbles include the fact that people in Paris aren't afraid to season foods with salt ... and these escargots could have used a lot more of it! I also can't fathom a \"real French\" bistro that has no fresh-cut baguettes for sopping up copious amounts of snail butter. Still ... I return!",

First and most importantly, the croissants are fantastic. Be sure to go in the morning because they do sell out sometimes. The coffee is strong and not-at-all bitter and it great hot or iced. My children love the macarons and we get a pack each time we eat there.   So far The kids and I have had the omelettes, the waffles and the crepes. I think next time I will have a croque monsieur. It all is amazing!  The decor has a rustic/industrial feel and is absolutely photogenic and fun!",

I mean if you are going to a French cafe, then you have to start with fresh croissants, coffee and end the meal with some macarons. Their omelette and Eggs Florentine are both delicious. They are also pretty good about any food substitutions if you tell them ahead of time.   This cafe is truly a great spot for a...ummm...comment dit-on en francais...a gourmandise!",

Tucked away in between a Subway and nail salon, you wouldn't expect to find such an authentic French restaurant with a calm atmosphere and BYOB service (and there is a corking fee,  FYI). I've come here quite a few times at different times of the day and I've always thorough enjoyed the food whether it was the beef bourguignon with pasta, a brie sandwich & side salad, or a simple pain au chocolat and some coffee. It may not have the most diverse menu, but EVERYTHING is delicious and worth the money you pay.   The place itself is on the smaller side, so I've only ever come in a group of 3 max, even though they can accommodate a slightly bigger party. The setting is pretty calm, not loud since you're sitting pretty close to the next table. You pretty much order at the front and then seat yourself but they do come around occasionally to make sure you have everything you need. The chef is really sweet too and once in a while comes out to make sure people are enjoying.",

The Croquet Madame is superb, full of flavor and the portion is a good size. The salad dressing was creamy and even though it was a small amount, covered the large salad I received as a side, well. My friends got the lamb meatballs and Chicken linguini and both were also delicious. I can't wait to go again this week and try something new. And if you want a rich, decadent, orgasmically good dessert, but don't prefer chocolate... try the Baba Rum! It's incredible.",

I had the eggs benedict which was presented adorably and tasted even better.  The coffee was fantastic and service was friendly.  One of my new favorite places!",

This morning I had the breakfast sandwich and it was one of the best that I've had in a long time. Everything was nicely flavored and it came with a delicious side salad. As I looked over the menu I keep seeing high quality dishes at reasonable prices. I will be coming back to try their dinner menu very soon.",

    "text": "New name same terrible management. I would be a stressed waitress too if there was no one to bus tables but me. However, give patrons a wait time or have them sign in. It was irritating to see a couple who arrived after us get seated first. Waiting is not a big deal, but ignoring customers is. Find someone who knows how to run a business and prioritizes customer service.",

For example the bun my burger was on had been made that day in house. The food is cleanly presented and everything taste great. The owner came and sat with us for bit and even gave us a free dessert when we couldn't decide. A great place to eat, we went a bit overboard and spent around $50 on a lunch for two but it felt worth it. We will definitely be returning.",

Except the balsamic vinaigrette is gone. Bring it back please! :)  Amazing pastries, I've taken many groups of people here, and it's always a hit.",
