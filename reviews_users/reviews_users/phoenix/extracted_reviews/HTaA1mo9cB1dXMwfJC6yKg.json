    "text": "My wife and I at at this place by Metro North Mall with some of her work colleagues.  We expected the food to be pretty bad and that she would have little choice as she is a vegan but we were really only there for the company.  It didn't start out well when they were out of Cabernet, but no big deal.  We weren't expecting anything that would be reviewed in Wine Spectator.  The only things on the menu that she would consider eating was the french fries until she learned they were fried in the same oil as the chicken and bacon.  The server offered to have the chicken left off of a salad for her and that is what she ordered.  As he took orders from the rest of the table he was conscientious to point out that anything other than standard menu items would be an extra charge.  After we ate some rather dreadful stuff and an incredibly banal salad we received the bill and I paid.  As we were getting ready to leave the thought occurred to me that if they charge  for some extra peppers they should probably have given us a discount for leaving off the chicken.  I checked my ticket and discovered we had paid full price of $11.95 for what was effectively a side salad with three olives which made it Mediterranean.  I asked the server about this and he agreed we should not have to pay full price and went to talk to the manager.   When he came back he informed me that the menu was as-is and there would be no discount.  Unfortunately I cannot give them less than one star because that is what this awful money-grubbing miserable chain outlet deserves.",

    "text": "Seriously the worst experience I have ever had at a bww. To start the bathrooms were disgusting, they were hot and dirty and smelled. That alone should have let me know what the rest of my experience was going to be like. Upon my arrival I spoke with a server on the patio and asked about coming in through the gate so that I would not have to bring my dog through the restaurant. I have been to a number of bwws and have never had an issue with my dog on their patio. The server told me it was fine to bring her through the restaurant so I carried my small dog through as I did not want to be rude. I ordered the Greek salad with chicken, which is what I regularly order. The hummus was literally inedible and the pita bread almost raw. The salad had multiple stalks from the bottom of the lettuce in it, which I don't know about you but I would not serve a salad like that to guests in my house let alone at a restaurant. While I was disappointed with the food I chalked it up to \"well it's a chain, probably shouldn't have high expectations.\" Then half way through our meal a manager came out and requested that I show him papers proving that my dog is a service dog. I did not have my purse on me, but I was wearing my medical walking boot. I have never been asked if my dog was a service animal on a patio in Arizona. I was then told that since I could not produce papers I would have to tie my dog up outside the patio where there is no shade and where she would constantly come back through the gate since she could fit through the bars. Not to mention walking on my busted ankle hurts enough, but the gates on the patio have alarms so to get her out there I was going to have to walk all the way out and around and then back the same way. My friend and I decided we would just try to finish our meal quickly, as I said we had already been there at least 30 minutes, but the manager came back out again. This time he brought a large man with him. I do not appreciate the fact that he was trying to physically intimidate me. At this I told him to just bring us boxes. This was literally the most ridiculous experience I have ever had at any restaurant and I will definitely not be returning. Not worth it to be subjected to such disrespect and low quality food.",

They should be embarrassed with the quality of salad they served.  Brown slimy lettuce and what wasn't slimy was wilted.  There were six pieces of chicken about the size of a dime and not much thicker!  Seriously!  I'm glad they only gave me about a cup of lettuce, because much more and I would have puked!  The preservatives on the lettuce was strong, so you know it had to be older than dirt to have it brown and wilted. All of this enjoyment for $8.49.  Came withe a cup of soup.  Glad it did or I would have died of hunger before I got to dinner. What a rip off! If I were you I would skip this place and go to Native New Yorker.

E.G.,  No sauce/wrong sauce. It's been on time,  but returning to get them fixed  x2 in 2 orders. nah.    My biggest cause of star loss is that BWW changed the policies in store on wing sizes, they used to say, ( at least 5,  at least 10, etc but no longer on the online order. For at least a week after this change, the online order wasn't updated and claimed a number/ price that you didn't get when you turned up in store.  For us, a wing here or there is minor but in all their stores that adds up.  I sent them a message through their contact form, got the usual we're looking at it, then nothing, I pinged them a couple of times via Twitter/ Facebook..still nothing.  update: The corp office didn't contact me until I filled out a complaint with our local consumer protection agency.",

Didn't get our ranch until 15 minutes later but by then we were already tired of waiting and pretty much done eating. Obviously every single one of our wings isn't going to be perfect and it's normal for them to have some dark spots, it's completely understandable... Tonight, there was one that was extremely dark all around and didn't look appealing in any way. I was afraid to eat it and just by looking at it you knew that it had to go straight in the trash!

I don't believe I have ever given a \"bad\" review of a restaurant before; typically I can find *something* positive to say, but in all honesty, if I could give this place negative stars, I would.   My fiance and I came in here on a Sunday night simply because it was close to our hotel -- and I wish we hadn't. Only wanting a snack, we ordered French fries and a small order of chicken wings. The wings were far from fresh and the fries were practically inedible - cold and incredibly greasy. Our poor waiter tried his best when it came to service, but the restaurant and kitchen were completely mismanaged and he was obviously overworked/restaurant under-staffed. We moved from the restaurant to the patio, due to the noise level, and while there was NO ONE ELSE on the patio, during the entire duration of our stay, the tables from the previous parties were never bussed or cleaned. And at one point, we ordered extra wing sauce, and it took more than 15 minutes - for one ramekin of sauce -- to arrive at our table.   Dirty, noisy, understaffed, mismanaged, slow, + cold, non-fresh, substandard food. Horrible experience all around. Don't bother. Drive a little farther and go somewhere else.",

My brother and I went to buffalo wild wings and we asked how long it would be as we had to run somewhere else in a bit of a hurry.   The waitress said about 15 minutes which seemed about normal for two small things of wings (just a snack before we had a meeting). We ended up not getting our wings for about 50 minutes and never heard from our waitress.   I saw someone nearby who had ordered a large portion of wings who got there after us and they received their wings before us. Now there could very well of been a reason for this but the server should have said there was a problem and we would have just left rather than wait for the food.  It was also not busy at all about 2:00 PM on a Wednesday.",

I wrote a review before regarding the service, but I can't seem to find it.   When we came here last month to pick up a To-go order, it took about 5 minutes before the servers and host finished their conversation to pay attention to us.

It started off okay with a bubbly waitress, Kayla, who may possibly be new.But as soon as we felt her uneasiness about our order's correction, we were unsure of how the rest of the night would be. Once our food was being sent out we realized the errors made. The waitress put in two items incorrectly. We understood the mistake was minor, other than being over charged for both. But what was very upsetting was to wait around for seemingly long amounts of time before having any help. After getting our check, we noticed the errors and pointed them out to the waitress. It took about 10 minutes for her to find help to fix the error. Once she fixed the error we waited 25 minutes for her to finally take our card and go to complete the transaction. Sadly the night was not very busy. And although Kayla may have been new, the management and other staff was not very attentive.",

She was definitely on her game when she greeted us. We asked her about the wings. She was quick to offer and suggest the different types of wing sauces. The way she described each sauce assured me that she definitely knew what she was talking about. She let us sample several sauces, 3 of which we actually chose. Felica also offered my sister samples of beer, 3 of which she never tried before and 3 of which she now loves. The experience and service here was unbelievable thanks in large part to Felica's knowledge of the menu/drinks, her down-to-earth personality, and her spectacular willingness to help out her guests. I'll definitely be referring friends to this location and I'll definitely be coming back very soon. Thanks for the outstanding service Felica!",

Our server took the drink orders quickly and by 4:30 we had ordered our food.  That was the last we saw of our server for another 30 minutes!  All around servers and kitchen staff were having wonderful chat time at the expense of the diners.  When the server came to ask if we wanted refills, I asked about our food (boneless wings and spinach artichoke flatbread) and was told that it should be done shortly, but the flatbread takes a little longer in the oven.  My refill and our meal arrived at the same time, another 15 minutes later.  I'm sorry, but if the flatbread takes over 40 minutes to make, there should really be a warning in the menu.  Was the food good- yeah.  Was it 45 minutes good- nope, nothing really is, especially an appetizer!",

Since we had never been in before he took the time to point out everything on the menu and recommended a few of his favorites. My fiance, mother-in-law to be and I shared an appetizer of wings. We had the mild sauce on half and hot bbq on the other. The wings were BOMB! Then we had our meals. They said their burgers were to die for, and the onion rings were delicious as well. As for my build your own chicken sandwich, it was ok. I should have ordered a burger, but all in all we had an awesome experience.

I've even let slide the loss of specials for traditional wings, at least for now. But tonight,  went to the bar area, where I feel I can be an adult, and had to be an adult. What I mean by that is that I felt like I had to watch everything I said and did, because, in the BAR area, there were no less than 7or8 kids around me in the 8 and less age. Is a bar area a concept or is it a permit thing because this is the first time I noticed this? If this is the new normal then I will start being\"myself\" in family dining areas as well as bar areas. I have always, in the past, stayed in adult areas so that children would not hear or see inappropriate behavior from my group of friends. Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

My black bean burger was actually pretty good and I wasn't expecting much. $30(ish) for a bar drink, app, and 2 entrees, not bad at all. Shout out to Cassandra and Kat, they are great!",

The manger Patti laughed and walked away while TWO people who WERENT employees escorted him out. I was saying something as they were getting him out and a server said \"oh that's a manager at happy valley and he has seizures\" it did not look like he was having a seizure he was drinking for awhile at BWW and the server had mentioned he was drinking before he got there as well. Either way Patti just laughed at WHATEVER happened, did not try and make sure he was okay if it was really a seizure. I stepped aside to talk with Patti about what happened and she said \"it's no big deal.\" This is a manager from the happy valley location so that's why it's no big deal? This needs to be addressed.. this needs to change. This is not ok at all. And that's why I'm writing this review.",

Great beer selection if you are a fan of every cheap domestic variety. Typical poor quality, yet overpriced sports bar food. Restaurant reeks of sanitizer. Tons of TVs so you can watch a wide variety of televised sports. At least they have that going for them.  According to the name of the restaurant, wings should be the specialty and by the looks of the menu, you would think that they are. Wide variety of sauce or rub options - classic or boneless. All sauces I have tried have been good but be prepared to ask for extra on the side. The wings come out dry, dry, dry...overcooked and hardly any sauce on them at all. This place manages to screw up the one thing that they should have going for them.   Skip this place unless you like throwing your money away. There are other places in the general vicinity to get your sports watching on.",

Not too spicy, tender steak with the right amount of guacamole, pico de gallo, and lettuce. Obviously, the fries were great, who doesn't love fries. Anyways, I am recommending this wrap, however your service lags. It's packed in here with two bartenders during happy hour. People would usually spend more money on alcohol in this joint then food, however with the service being slow at the bar due to staffing issues that's what you get.  This place definitely lost some money with our group of 25.",

I usually go to Native Grill on the other side of the freeway but wanted to give this place a chance.   I'll probably stick to going there.  I honestly think the server in the bar area had too much more than she could actually handle.   On the plus side they had several tv's.

It wasn't even hot and creamy like a mac and cheese should be.   My friend ordered the New Yorker sandwich. The sandwich and fries came out COLD. GTFO. We let the waiter know about how cold the sandwich was and he took it back to the kitchen. He seemed very irritated that the food was cold. We then asked for the sandwich to go after waiting so long for the 2nd sandwich, we asked for the manager. Waited 10 minutes for the manager...while waiting for the manager, our server then started with the excuses...\"We don't have that many people on\" \"I am doing everything, busing, exposing, running my own food.\" Who wants to hear those excuses? What was he willing to do to make it right?? I work in the service industry I play all roles at times too...that is not an excuse. When the manager finally came he took care of everything. Was very happy that he took full responsibility for the restaurant.   I will not go back there again. Very disappointed.",

We ordered honey BBQ, mango habanero, and medium boneless wings with some onion rings on the side. The onion rings were packed into the smallest to go box when usually you get a ton if you dine in and at the other locations, they give you the big to-go box with onion rings(or whatever side you order). The wings that were supposed to be medium flavored were plain.. there was absolutely no sauce on them. The wings that were mango habanero were so lightly sauced up, it didn't have any heat to it. I'm pretty disappointed that they even messed this up. I love Buffalo Wild Wings, but this location hasn't impressed us.",

The burger was also a let down. It was super bland and not with the price. The only good thing was the UFC fight was free. I would not go back even for the free fight.",

At this location (visiting from out of town), I walked in and the bar was completely empty, which I've never seen at the one I usually go to.  Then when I sat down, I quickly learned why...it stunk.  The area smelled like cheap cleaning products, kind of like bleach with other heavy cleansers.  I ended up having a beer and leaving, and that was too long.",

    "text": "We came in for dinner and watch some college football Friday night. Since we've been here multiple times to watch NFL and MLB we know that good service can be provided even when they're crazy busy.   The bar is seat yourself so we sat and waited and waited for someone to come wipe off our table (it was the only one available) and bring us menus. Not a huge deal since they were super busy.   Our server (who will go unnamed) greeted herself and took our drink orders. I ordered a long-island iced tea since they were on special and I haven't had one in forever. It was HORRIBLE, I have had many Long-Islands in my day and this by far was the worst. It was orange, I think they filled the glass half way with sour mix, added some well liquor even though it was supposed to be top-shelf and forgot the splash of coke. Problem is she brought the drink when she took our food order so I didn't get a chance to drink it until she walked away. Normally, I won't say anything, I'll just down the drink and order something else next time. This was so bad and so sour I couldn't even get it down.   Finally I flagged her down and ordered something else, when I told her I would like to get something else because...well i couldn't finish my sentence because her ADHD took over and away she went. I sat there with my mouth opened wondering if I was even talking out loud (my bf assured me I was). She left the drink on the table so I really wasn't certain she heard me.   Then the food came. I had ordered a create-your-own chicken sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. The sandwich came out exactly as I had ordered. However, I had the wrong dressing for my salad and we had no silverware. She dropped off the food, never asked if we wanted anything else and just took off, I tried stopping her but that was a lost cause.   I sat there looking around, trying to make eye-contact with anyone who was glancing my way. Our server was just standing by the bar chit-chatting. Finally someone walked by and I asked if we could get silverware and ketchup, I had high-hopes she would bring me a fork, but she didn't. So there I sit some more, unable to eat my salad. Finally a manager walked by and I asked him, instead of him grabbing it, he shouted for someone else to do it. YAY, I got a fork. Too bad the dressing was wrong (and not tasty) and no server to ask to correct it. Finally when I'm putting my last bite in my mouth she came over and asked how we're doing. Really? You're going to ask me now? UGH.   Well at this point I'm fed up and while we'll probably go to BW3 in the future, it certainly will not be this location.",

    "text": "First things first: every Buffalo wild wings I've ever been to trumps the wings and service at Hooters. I don't understand people that say they prefer Hooters over BWW.  Most importantly are the wings. I don't know what kind of scrappy chickens Hooters sources their wings from, but Buffalo's wings are almost twice as big.  The food overall seems comparable in taste and quality across states. We got a sampler with three different kinds and loved every single flavor of wing. I actually ended up eating most of it because my friend has a stomach sleeve and can't eat much. More for me!  I had no problem with the wait or the service, even though it was a Saturday night. I honestly don't see anything wrong with the place except for the large amounts of people that seem to dress up like it's a fancy restaurant. It was really... weird (especially the ladies in sparkly and skimpy dresses).  My friend said it's because BWW is all people have to go to out here lol. That's pretty sad. Either way, a lot of the reviews seem hit or miss, but I think it's worth the risk for some good wings.",

I ordered the potato wedges with cheese and bacon got home and they were so dry and hard  as a rock that I couldn't eat them. I called and the manager said the potatoes are always like that so beware! The boneless chicken was dry and had little sauce. I mean my money is just as good as the next persons. Thanks for making me feel like I don't matter and that I bothered you to ask for a refund. They wouldn't refund the chicken either just the potatoes. Beware!",

The service was so bad that my friend got up and got her self a refill from their soda fountain. They did not have SILVERWARE....we asked for it 3 times and the waitress said it looks like we're all out right now hahaha the place was maybe 20% occupied during lunch and you don't have SILVERWARE!!!!

On Tuesdays, wings are half off!  I place my order online, drive down, pick them up and then grub them in my car.  Service has been fantastic at this particular BWW.  My order has been ready on time, every single time, and I have always been greeted with a smile.  On to the wings........  I usually order a small order of wings with medium sauce.  You get 10 wings coated in their tasty Buffalo sauce.  When you order online, you can even customize your order to some extent (You can pick one option such as \"extra crispy\", or \"all drumsticks\", or \"light sauce\" etc.  I am a big fan of drumsticks, so I usually go that route and get all drumsticks for my order.  The wings are always crispy, hot, fresh and decent sized too.    For $6.41, you get a filling lunch.  I will be back here every single Tuesday as long as they have half price wings.  Can't beat the price and the wings are really good!",

I came with my Mom (from New Orleans) to this location in Phoenix, AZ  on Sunday around noon to watch the end of the Saints game. The hostess says it will be over an hour to seat us. 2 people. Just 2 people. Well we stayed because we could watch the game while waiting by hostess station. I do credit a waitress, who suggested to us the tables outside (weather here was cool that day). We took the offer and enjoyed the Saints-Bears game with our food until it was over. Thanks BW3.",

We chose to eat in the bar area. At the first table we chose (the only open one) we waited for someone to come clean it. After 5-7min of waiting we moved to another table that had opened up and had been cleaned. Now it took our waitress 10 min to come over and introduce herself. We ended up placing our drink, appetizer and meal order all at once. When the food did come out, it came out all at once instead of appetizers and then our meal. I ordered the chicken chop salad. It came to me with no dressing. Our waitress didn't come ask us how everything was for at least 7-10 min. It was at this time I was able to tell her about my salad dressing missing, but everyone else in my party was done eating, so I just asked for everything to go.  My husband had ordered a beer. His cup sat empty for about 15 min. No one ever asked if he wanted another or even showed up at the table so he could at least get a water. Because of this, he was unable to finish his food because of the spice associated with eating.  My daughter never did get her crown...it was a disappointing evening. This review is coming from someone who used to eat there almost weekly during football season...",

    "text": "BWW is suppose to be a sports bar, but they play their music very loud like you would have at a wild night club at midnight. The food and service is pretty much pretty good, and the Captains are in general friendly, with the exception for Becca she's a mouthy jerk. Me personally BWW having Captains is a joke, all they really do is interrupt the customers socializing and does nothing they promise.  We've been going to this BWW since they opened, but the past 2-3 months a few of the Captains crank the music so loud that we have had to put ear plugs in. Yesterday once again when we showed up about 4:45 pm there was about 10 customers in the place. The music was rocking stupid loud Becca mentioned she's the (joke) Captain and she's there to make our stay pleasant. I asked her to please turn down the music, she replied she'll think about it but never did. When our server showed up I asked him to please turn down the music in the dinning area, he did. But after about 30 minutes of pleasant dinning, Becca decided to be a jerk again and cranked the music even louder than it was before. We quickly finished our drinks and left about one hour earlier than we normally do. We dine out 7 days a week at a different establishment, NEVER  none of the other places is this rude with loud music. A few of the employees at BWW Metro have absolutey NO respect for the customers and do what they want. We've been there when they crank up the music so loud that young children start crying making it misurable for other customers.  If it wasn't for the ignorance with the excessive loud music in a so called sports bar and the few jerk employees we have had to deal with, I would have given more stars. But after our experience last night compliments from a mouthy jerk Becca ruining our evening with excessively loud music 2 stars was actually to many.  A few of these ignorant young people at BWW just doesn't seem to comprehend if you loose customers you won't make money. We survived many years without BWW Metro, and I'm pretty sure we'll do just fine at Native, Hooters, Chill's, Fajitas just to name a few in this area that we go to where we don't have to deal with ignorance with stupid loud music and ignorant captains. I did talk to Peter today (the big manager over several BWW) he appears to be ok with the loud music, we're not. IMO can the Captains idea and put them to work as servers actually taking care of the customers. The Captains do NOTHING when it comes to serving the customers with food and drink when the servers are not available. One good thing I'm not the only one doing a review on this place complaining about the stupid loud music.",

    "text": "I just went to this restaurant after it opened. The problem is not really with the food but with the atmosphere. The music was extremely loud. No one could talk to each other at our own table. Another issue was how they were serving the beer. They bought us a beer that had the top of the head a good half inch to inch below the top of the glass, This was consistent for all 3 of our beers. One person in our group mentioned this to the server that delivered them and we were told this was the proper way it was to be served. After we looked at all the other beers being brought out, they were all with the head at the top of the glass. We spoke to the manager about it when he came by to check on us and he said again that ours were served properly. We showed him all the other beers and he said, \"Huh?\" It would seem that a new place would be interested in feedback and try to take it in a little better than in a more confrontational way.  The food was good. The majority of us had wings. They had a ton of flavors which was nice. Unfortunately, you have to order a minimum of 6 of a flavor so it doesn't leave much opportunity for experimenting. I had the Caribbean Jerk and the Parmesan. They were good just not enough to really entice me to come back. There are some other places near by with great wings and we can actually talk to each other when we go.",

I didn't eat so I can't really judge the food, but they seemed to have dug the nachos with chicken. Although my personal preference is to have some extra chips to scoop up straggler toppings, they were fine with the chip to topping ratio. It was a pretty standard B-Dubs experience. The only thing that could have been better was the way the check was handled. Homeboy put the gentlemen's nachos on my bill, even though they and only they consumed them (I didn't even order them...so that was confusing). I mean whatevs. We figured it out. Then once we were ready with our cards, we waited a good ten minutes for him to reappear, which he never did. We went inside to try to pay but this seemed too much for ye old B-Dubs to handle.

My husband mentions that if a table is reserved it should have signs on it so people don't sit down and have to move.  Instead of saying Im sorry or I'll let a manager know Aaron decides to get snappy and tell us we should just get there earlier next time. Thanks Aaron, we'll keep that in mind when we go anywhere but this Buffalo Wild Wings location.

I put us down for inside so it would come up quicker, then several people came up behind us and were seated before us, on the patio.  Weird.  So we are seated and we order  beers and appetizers (garlic mushrooms) and the mushrooms came before the beer.  And they were tiny.  I tasted no mushrooms in the breading, and I've had them before and they haven't been like that.  By the time I got my beer I was so thirsty I drank it all before my wings came.  Then my mango habenero wings came, and no beer.  So while waiting for my next beer my songs got cold.  Bad experience, bad meal, if we do ever go back to a BWW it won't be this one.",

My biggest pet peeve is that this is just a typical sports bar with a typical, sub-par, beer lineup. They have 25-35 taps (never really counted), and most of them are cliche beers. I never understood why they needed coors light, miller lite, bud light, bud, PBR, and Mich Ultra on the same lineup, due to the fact that they are virtually the same. Yes, I know they're going to be your top sellers with good margins and quick turnaround, but take 1 or 2 off and throw some better crafts on tap. Their crafts are just as cliche, with your typical Fat Tire, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, 312 Urban Wheat. I do like that they support local with some Four Peaks brews, but overall, the tap lineup is a let down, but tolerable. I've never eaten here, but I'm sure the food is just as good as any other sports bar restuarant. I wouldnt ever choose to go here, but if friends decided to meet there, I would join.",

We have been there twice, sat at the bar both times and had the complete displeasure of seeing the bartender Carlos or \"los\" as his jersey states.  Horrible bartender.  The last time, we had a female bartender and \"los\" came over and asked us to close out our tab because he was leaving.  He was not our bartender and wanted us to close out our tab because he wanted the 2 bucks for the tip.  The food there is not worth speaking about so it's not worth having to deal with \"los\" either.  Too bad.  The location is great.",

They should know about the patterns of their own restaurant better. Then, when I got there, the hostess was rude, seemingly because she was so overwhelmed. They need to learn to employ people who can handle pressure, because that's life in the restaurant business. She also didn't seem to even understand what I was saying, so either she was thickheaded or not listening. I'm personally in the industry, and the way she handled it was so ridiculously unprofessional. I've never been to one of these places, but I walked right back out the door and will never come back.",

It's not like queen creek.  The booth we are in has a wobbly back.  Two different sets of people have sat behind us and all of them took turns bashing us in the back.    Now, you don't know me so let me enlighten you... I don't care to go to restaurants and sit near kids.  As their parents enjoy their conversation because they easy tune out the screaming, while I have to sit feeling like there is a drill bit in my ears.  So who's on the opposite side of our booth you ask?  A couple.  With .THREE. Kids.  And they are screaming.  Why you ask? Because the parents are enjoying their evening and let be honest, kids really only stay calm for 20 minutes or so. Not happy.   Ok so now let's move onto the food.  Most of the boneless wings are so hard, you can't even chew them.  They literally feel like they are going to break my teeth.  My family can't even chew theirs either. Ordering new ones would take an hour and quite frankly I don't think I want to be bashed in the back or hear the screaming any longer.  We decided to eat the edges of the ones that had sort of soft spot.    Very sad.  We probably won't be back.  What a bummer. This place is so close to our house.",

We ordered our favorite appetizers of fried pickles and cheese curds with a side of caramel (which is a must try).  Lexi, our favorite waitress, brought out our appetizers because she knew we where there just based off our order. It was so good to see her. The reason Lexi is our favorite is because she remembers us which makes it nice to quickly catch up with her while she delivers our food. Unfortunately we weren't at one her tables tonight.  We also ordered a BOGO medium boneless wings which is seriously the best deal ever! But the kitchen got confused on our order which is one medium to be Honey BBQ and the other Vampire Slayer with a little extra Garlic Parm drizzled on top. When they brought out our food it was horribly wrong and asked them to try again. They got it right the second time. Thankfully we weren't in a hurry.  Then we where charged for two BOGOs which our waitress fixed immediately once she saw the mistake and took on of the BOGOs off.  The reason for the 4 stars in a nut shell is simply this is normally a 5 star location and excellent service. But last night the kitchen and wait staff seemed to be off there game a bit (Except Lexi, we are positive she is always a 5 star worker).",

    "text": "I wanted to order some wings for pickup so I headed down there and decided to call my order in. Just a medium order of wings, Grace answered and said that she could take my order if I could hold. But by the time I got there, I had been on hold for 15 minutes. I arrived and walked in, still on hold, and waited at the empty counter for another 5 minutes. When a frazzled girl finally ran up to the counter, I told her to not worry about answering the phone, that it was me and I was hanging up after being on hold for so long. To my surprise, it was Grace!  Grace was disinterested, did not smile, and had no energy. She was insincere, and didn't act like she wanted to be there at all. I ordered boneless wings, and she asked me loudly \"traditional or boneless??\" when I thought I was being clear. I'm sure she was thinking about what she was going to do when she got off work instead of the duties she is collecting an hourly wage for. With people like Grace as the face and voice of your establishment, I'll just go somewhere else next time.  Be better, Grace... Treat the people who walk in like they are valued and not a bother for you to help out. Look up 'hospitality' in the dictionary, and some other words you haven't heard of like 'service', 'smile', and, 'courteous'.  Look to your left and right at the people around you. They are all better and outperforming you.",

She didn't smile ever and made us feel like an inconvenience. She never checked on us. Our drinks were all empty. The bar wasn't even half full so I'm not sure why service was so slow. We sat at the table for another 10 minutes after we were done eating before she finally brought us the check, which we wanted to have split, but didn't want to wait another 15 minutes. I tried to say something to the takeout girl and she just kept saying \"uh huh\" and then said \"sorry that happened\" and made it more than obvious that nothing was going to come of it. So I didn't waste my time anymore and just left. This location has just been worse and worse every time we've come.",

However, I have no idea why we continue to go to this place and put ourselves through this torture. The service is always TERRIBLE. Tonight I finally decided to write a review. As always, we were seated right away. The hostess/ hosts are always polite and quick to seat us. Once seated, we waited 25 minutes until being greeted by a server. TWENTY. FIVE. MINUTES. Multiple servers walked right by us during that time but they ALWAYS ignored us despite me trying to make eye contact. Finally, we were greeted by Andre I believe his name was. He was very sweet and told us that there was some confusion with servers getting cut and passing on their tables. I would totally understand, if this wasn't the third time I've heard this! We didn't order any food and just wanted drinks. They came quickly and our server was nice and attentive after that. Nothing was wrong with him and his service. However, this is the umptieth time I've come and we ALWAYS wait forever! Slowest service ever. Unless you have hours to waste, I would avoid this place unfortunately.",

No complaints there. Service began rather quickly and we decided on onion rings as a starter and a couple mojitos while we sorted through the menu.  The onion rings were very good and the dipping sauce reminded me of the sauce Outback uses with their blooming onion.   The mojitos we got were the angry berry mojitos with the angry orchard in them. My wife had a sip and hated it so she opted for another one, which the manager happily replaced and didn't charge us for. I didn't mind mine.  We both ordered small orders of wings in Caribbean Jerk and Hot flavors. The Jerk was spicy yet sweet and quite good. The hot was exactly how it sounds.  We ordered another round of mojitos which came out quick. We also ordered some cheese curds, but they never came out. We had to cancel our order because we'd had enough of the noise after sitting for an hour waiting.  If you get here during the slower times, the place is pretty good. If you happen to be here during the rush then prepare to suffer slow service and loud noise.",

The wings are eh at best, not crispy at all, but I've read others reviews that they were too crispy so obviously no consistency. The sauce tastes like it's store bought and so does the ranch, I don't believe anything is fresh made here. The ranch is awful. Plus, the wings are expensive. $14+ for 11 traditional wings? Artichoke dip also seems frozen/pre-made if that makes sense, it's not good where ever they got it. Have had their burgers also, don't even remember which tells me it was nothing out of the ordinary. My husband gets the boneless wings and he loves them, those are good. Beer selection is good.",

Thank you for being honest, but my father was standing behind you instead of sitting like a guest should be. The food was not good, and I'm more than positive it took over 30 minutes to get wings to the table. Half the table got their food, while the other half waited and waited. I've been in the industry before, and I would never take my guests chair, or have I been to a place where a server has. Second if the kitchen is being late a manager should at least address it.

The restaurant wasn't very crowded and yet the bathrooms were a little bit dirty and it took a while for us to get seated. Once we were seated, someone  came and checked on us but it wasn't our server because 'she was busy.' We ordered two Caeser salads, a sandwich and some wings. The wings seemed ok. The salads were both wilted, with very dry chicken. I asked for them to hold the croutons, but there was a tortilla and bread? The sandwich was the most interesting because it came with maybe a dozen fries. There weren't even enough fries to create a pile. The final craziness was the cocktail glass that was so tiny it kept spilling. All in all, we won't be back.",

Located outside the Metrocenter mall area, this would be my first visit at this location. Thankfully made it on time to see the Phoenix Suns select the #1 draft pick, as I ate some lemon peppered wings and macaroni cheese.  For some reason the wings did not have as much of a lemon peppery flavor as I expected. They had more of a naked flavor. Definitely not the fault of the server as she was awesome and friendly. But still disappointed with the way the wings turned out. To compliment my meal I had some ice tea and a coors light that was on special for $2!",

Too much Jalapenos)   We make our order after finding out \"Dine in was 2 wings under carry out and literally for the same price.  We get the order around 5:40 EXTRA Crispy Desert Heat, Easy Heat with Heat on the side, with add-ons celery and carrots sith way too much Ranch.  My son picks up the first and gives me the face.... \"Not Extra Crispy Dad\" I motion for Manager and she makes it over In approx  9 minutes. We explained our situation.  And 22 minutes later the same woman who took the wings said \"The Manager is Quality Control checking your wings they should be out shortly\". It's now 6:41 pm.   You know you have been a place too long when people sit, order, eat and pay and you still do not have your food. My wife brings up a great point.. What Kind of check is the kitchen manager doing if we still don't have wings. 6:46pm.  So just before Happy Hour is over they bring Round 2 of Extra Crispy wings... FAIL  O.K. Iam 2 tall boys in, to be fair the 20 minutes down wings would not pass the \"Wife's Thwacky-Wing\" touch test.   Now it looked like they did a mix but we had to Pass, so it's 3 Tall-Boys in and we are on to Bratwurst for me and Burgers for the wife and son.  To be continued  So our replacement order finally showed up, and we got to talking with the Blue Shirt Gal who told us a story about the Deer Valley location where a customer ordered 35 ahead of time to drop his wings and he drive in to get Extra Crispy wings pulling away from the bone.  So I know she gets it as she also confessed she does not eat meat off the bone chicken.  Tonight was rough  But I still have faith they can recover  Our bill reflects it. They did us Right for 2 Strikes and a Miss on Friday Diner.  Thanks again for trying Peoria team we will be back soon",

Lots of TVs with sports on, decent beer selection and \"meh\" food. I will be honest, the wings at Tim Finnegan's are better, which is sad considering that is kind of Buffalo Wild Wing's staple menu item.  The other challenge is that this and the new Olive Garden building are in a... less nice part of Metrocenter circle, right next to 2 cheap motels. Good if you wanna score crack or a prostitute, bad if you want your car to be safe in the lot after dark.   If you wanna watch a game in a chain restaurant, this is the place.

Wings are their specialty but we chose salads for lunch. They were good but not a generous plate. Attentive service from young lady server who addressed me mostly instead of hubby. Not a smart move as he was paying the bill.",

We were offered a table by people that were leaving and their cups and trash were still on the table. The waitress cleaned it right away. We got our drinks right away. We ordered appetizers and they came in a timely manner. Once our food was ordered it came about 15/20 minutes later. Reasonable. Nice and warm very delicious. The honey bbq wings very extremely scrumptious. I wish we ordered a bigger batch. I gave it 4 stars because there was a charge for beer on our ticket. We drank ice tea and lemonade! She removed it but had I not checked I would have never noticed. I don't normally check for those things. But we still gave a great tip because she was very attentive and extremely busy. We will definitely be back.",

He would barely look at me in the eyes while talking, rolled his eyes at me, and he never smiled- we were definitely not welcomed.

When ordered, we requested extra ranch and blue cheese. The lady taking the order to which I replied, that is fine, I am already spending $175, a few dollars for ranch isn't a problem.  When we picked up the food, they handed us a big bag and said here are your condiments. When we opened it, there were two ranch and two blue cheese... Oh, tons of ketchup which is what was filling the bag.  Called to let them know, expecting nothing more than a genuine apology and instead, the \"manager\" whose name was Chase let us know that is how many you get with that size order and we would have had to pay more for more. Absolutely no resolution and not even a sincere apology.  I would not recommend this location!",

She  forgot to bring a rag and ended up putting all our napkins  on the spill, and made it seem  like such a problem for her to get more napkins. Would speak to the floor manager but she was on her cell not working. our waitress name tag said Cass. the only employee actually working on the floor was a man named Terry, whom we wish we would get as a server more often.

I ordered a bottled beer (craft) and the waitress had never heard of it before.

With that being said, I ordered it. SLIDER sized patties and the \"Shaved prime rib\" was non existent. I have had better burgers for half the price (the BEEFY Burger was $11)  Although friendly, the staff was lazy. They all seemed to huddle around the side of the bar and talk.

Where I had serious issues was when a customer sat next to my friend and me. He professed to be a gang member, then tried to start a fight with my friend. My friend and I had no desire to fight anyone, and I thought the appropriate measure would be to inform management of what was going on so they could remove the individual starting a fight in their establishment. However, the guy starting the fight was a regular customer, and management decided he could stay because he said he would stop. I was beside myself. This guy had threatened to assault my friend and was allowed to stay. I wasn't okay with continuing to sit next to this guy. I told them that they need to ask him to leave. As they refused, I became irate and berated the manager for allowing this to happen. Because I was speaking loudly, we were asked to leave instead. This was over a month ago, and I'm still livid about the situation. The bottom line is that if one attends this establishment regularly, it's okay to threaten other customers. If you speak out about being threatened, you'll get thrown out.",

She wasn't pushy but always checked on us when the time was right.  Star 3 is for the atmosphere. It's your typical sports bar type of atmosphere which is great for wings.  Star 4 is for the food being worth the price. While I'm not satisfied with their wings being 70 cents now. They are still so good that I keep coming back for more.

    "text": "I've been here a few times on and off over the past few months, and I have to say, it's not half bad.  Plenty of seating, staff and a decent menu selection.  When I'm here, I usually sit at the bar, and so far so good.  I've come here for happy hour, and they have some pretty decent specials.  I usually get the chili and cheese dip thing, and a beer depending on how I feel.  They have domestic taps on special for happy hour, and the selection is pretty good.  I think unless it's on tap and domestic, they won't put it on their happy hour menu, so you have to pay full price.  (I tried to order a specialty beer one time and this is how I found out.)  They have plenty of TV's and seem to host events here from time to time. Things such as raffles and a variety of other items.  Staff is friendly and helpful even when busy.  The last time I came here was Friday night, and that was okay.  I went with a plate of 8 boneless hot wings since I was to late for happy hour, and they came out a bit spicier then I had anticipated, but were tasty none the less.  The only setback was they served them to be in a cardboard tray instead of a plate, so when I was cutting them up with my fork and knife, one or two half's flew out and I was like WTF.  Granted, I may not be the most graceful girl in the world, but when food starts flying and booze isn't involved, I can only wish I would have had a plate instead.  The service here is pretty good, and never really had a bad experience.  They have a bazillion TV's so you can always catch some kind of sporting event no matter what it is. I also like that they have free trivia, and I play from time to time depending on if I'm alone or not. I never do very well, but hey, it's fun!",

    "text": "I don't typically write reviews, especially bad ones, but my experience yesterday at BW3's was frustrating.  I'll say first, I'm a bit more of a vegetable lover but went to this restaurant last night at my son's request for his 17th birthday.  My daughter has a gluten intolerance, so it was frustrating to see that there was nothing diet friendly for her.  But we made the best of it due to the birthday.  I ordered a side salad as my meal.  What I received was one of the most spoiled gross plates of, what used to be food, in front of me.   I felt like Gordon Ramsey picking through my dish.  Most of the lettuce was brown and wilting.  Buried under that, was a wad of dark brown mush approximately 2 inches in diameter.  I thought at first it may be a mushroom, but no... it was (or used to be) lettuce.  More appropriately you could call it compost.  I showed my server my discovery.  He apologized profusely and took the salad back and brought me a new one.  This one was fine.  Missing some of the ingredients that are supposed to come on it, most notably the Parmesan cheese.  But at that point it didn't really matter.  I didn't have trust in the BOH/kitchen and was too grossed out to eat anything more.  My daughter also had a side salad.  I started inspecting her food after sending mine back.  Her lettuce was in the same dismal shape, minus the wad of rotted food.  I can only imagine how many days ago those salads were prepped and sat. 5? 10 maybe?  I sent her salad back too.  I was told a manager would be stopping by.  He never did.  Salads were also not comped from the receipt.  I chose not to complain because my son was already feeling bad about not choosing a restaurant everyone would enjoy.  I assured him it wasn't his fault but there was definitely a deflated feeling to the meal.  I worked for over 10 years in the food industry doing every job from server/dishwasher/expo/hostess/wait staff/to event planning.  I know what goes into a kitchen.  I have grave hesitations about eating the food here based off what I saw last night.",

The host/hostess didn't really look like they knew what they were doing and a ton of people hadn't been helped yet. We decided to sit outside because it was less crowded. Our waitress was really nice and took our order promptly. The food usually takes a long time to come out but that's at every BWW location. I never have any complaints about their wings. I really enjoy them and all the different flavors. I usually look forward to their monthly sauce. It took a while to get our waitress to give us our check. We were probably there for another 15-20 minutes after we were done eating waiting for her to come back. She kept passing us and helping other people. I sort of wish they had a self pay tablet like Applebee's and Chili's. It would make checkout much faster.  Side note: I've also ordered from this location to go and wasn't really impressed. The last time I did this, I waited  at the pickup counter for 15 minutes before being acknowledged by anyone and once I was, I was informed that there had been a mixup with my order and I had to wait an additional 15 minutes. I also don't understand why they charge you extra for dipping sauce when you order on the app but it's free in the restaurant. They gave me free sauce anyway for the inconvenience.",

We were ready to order right away after ordering drinks, but the waiter left so quickly we didn't get a chance to do so. He came back and we ordered 15 boneless with 3 different flavors and a large side of fries to share.   The wings arrived and they were cold. Not just warm, but cold. Totally unenjoyable to eat cold wings. The fries were warm, but they were extremely salty. I'm not usually one to nit pick places, but these were hard to eat. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here unless there is a turn around on the quality of food.",

I would NOT recommend this location to anyone, but I will recommend the location in Surprise as I've had excellent service at that location.  We ordered, and I ordered a medium boneless wings, half asian zing and half salt and vinegar.  When the order came, the waitress dumped the food on the table and I had gotten traditional wings, but 7/8 of the plate was asian zing, and only about 3-4 pieces were salt and vinegar.  Our waitress never checked on us until she came with the bill.  I explained that I didn't order traditional, I ordered boneless and that most of the plate was asian zing.  She then appeared with a bill with both the  boneless and the traditional wings, and a military discount, which was totally wrong.  I met with the MOD, and she took the traditional off, but she should have gave me half off the order for the order coming with 1) traditional wings and 2) they were not boneless.  She couldn't see the point and by this time I was boiling so I just paid the bill, but I guarantee you, I will smear their name all over social media.  I'm not sure if the restaurant reads these reviews, but let me tell you, your customer service needs a lot of work.  Unless I see anything in the future, I will NOT recommend this location to ANYONE.",
