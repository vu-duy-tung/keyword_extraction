From traditional burgers to burgers with two maple donuts as buns, this place has it all. Expect lots of options here, a fun environment, and a busy dining rooms, since it's on Mill Ave. There is a pretty generous happy hour with both drinks and food on the menu, so start your night out right and stop in at Rehab for a good dinner before a night of drinking!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places to grab lunch!   My boyfriend and I always start out with a basket of fries (half regular, half sweet potato). It's great because it comes with sauces - I think you get to choose three - and the fries are always so crispy and delicious. Sometimes we come JUST for the fries.   If you're feeling adventurous, try the mac n'cheese burger. It's cheesy and messy and might give you a heart attack on your way home (they don't call it Rehab for nothing), but it's soooo good.  Another thing I love is their Gluten Free buns - they don't crumble or fall apart while you're eating your burger, which can be hard to find.   The burgers are really rich in flavor, so I tend to split one with friends. It's usually really busy, but if there's a wait, it's worth your time! Parking isn't the best, but there's a lot nearby that you can park in and just walk over.",

Today I came in, after waiting over 10 minutes for someone to ask for our order, we asked a random waitress & inquired about the weekend special burger. The waitress had no idea there was even a special burger today. The worst part was when she asked who our original waiter was, she didn't know, turns around & simply blurts out \"what do you want?\" I'm not a waiter or waitress but the tone of voice which this was said in, atrocious to say the least. I drive all the way from Laveen to come eat here the times I do. This may very well be my last. Even with the food being as amazing as it is.",

He took that as a challenge to make us understand and appreciate the hype! Jet guided us with great recommendations, told us what sauces to pair with the frys or tater tots and burgers, brought an extra sauce out for us to try and they were all great. We ordered the jalapeno popper burger, pulled pork sandwhich and Nelson con verde pollo, appetizer.....it was all delicious! The hamburger buns make such a difference on a good burger or even pulled pork sandwhich, this place is spot on! Glad we tried it and we will be back!",

I waited and waited... but still no burgers. Finally, months after they started construction, they were open!!! I was thrilled. I had high expectations and they've been met with every visit.  First the Food: Every burger provides mouthfuls of flavour and happiness. My favourite is the PB+J+Sriracha burger. It's messy, but it is AMAZING. I could eat this everyday. But... I probably shouldn't. Right? Also high on my least: the mac and cheese burger, the Hawaiian burger, and the poppers burger. All so good.   There are two sizes. If you're into sharing, get the bigger burger and split it. It'll be more than enough food.   Pretzel buns are the way to go. Dense and chewy, and oh so delicious.   Also, sweet potato tots? Just say yes. Unless you like normal potatoes. They're good too.  Service: they're dressed in Hawaiian shirts. These guys are chill.   Come and get a burger, you won't regret it.",

    "text": "Awesome place for burgers in Tempe!  I've been to the Rehab burger in Scottsdale, and this one in Tempe does not disappoint as well! In fact, it's a lot more spacious than the original.  We ordered a couple of burgers and I also got the signature spicy Mac n cheese! Everything was phenomenal!!!! The service was great!  If there is one thing I urge you to try it's the spicy Mac and cheese. The flavor of it is amazing, and it's actually not that spicy! I would highly recommend going here again!   Tips: 1) get the sweet potato tater tots, they're the best!  2) parking here is scarce since it's on Mill, you may need to find a spot anywhere and just walk here 3) get the spicy Mac n cheese, it's sooo good! If you get the \"rehab\" size, it's definitely easily shared with 5-6 people",

    "text": "I'm really disappointed because I've heard this place be hyped up so many times. I'm sure a good experience can be had here, but we did not have one.   We got to the restaurant around 8 on a weekday, a little close to closing for me, but it wasn't busy & they took us. We sat & it took about 5ish minutes for someone to come over & take our drink order which is pretty average for me. We took until our server brought the drinks back to order because we were a little indecisive. After we ordered (Know Poblano Burger & Veggie Noogie), the wait began. In total wait time, we sat for close to 55 minutes waiting on our food. The average wait time is usually 23 minutes (and my fiance being in the business knows places usually push for that). About 40 minutes in, we asked how much longer the food would be (let me say in a really nice tone) and the server just told us when it's ready. I really wanted to leave & just go to Whataburger, but I was trying not to be a jerk. Our drinks didn't get refilled until we had our food on the table. The food wasn't the worst, but I wasn't impressed. The wait time had already created a lackluster experience. The fries were cold on both of our plates, the eggplant on my sandwich was so tough I just ended up removing it, but his burger was fine.   I don't think I would ever return as a sit down customer, maybe takeout, but that's pretty out of the way for us, so I don't see us driving out there to come home with cold food (especially since we could've gotten cold food there).",

    "text": "I was craving a burger--a REAL burger--and Rehab was everything I wanted and more. It is truly rare to have one's expectations met so well!  Every menu item looks great, but I needed something spicy, so I went with the Know Poblano burger, with manchego cheese, actual, actually grilled poblano peppers, and sauteed onions. Because this wasn't enough spice for me, and I felt brave, I went with the beef chorizo patty.   It was everything I wanted and more.  The chorizo itself was surprisingly lean without being dry. It was basically a burger loaded--LOADED with spice. Like, it only burned my tongue a little bit, but the whole thing was so full of seasoning that the steam would make my eyes water every time I lifted it to take a bite. That's not a complaint, that's freaking amazing. On the side were *perfect* fries seasoned with garlic salt, as well as some sriracha aioli.   I washed it down with a large margarita, which was discounted thanks to Thursday's all-day happy hour. It was definitely not weak, and for sure not too sweet. Spectacular, just like everything else.   If you're not into (red) meat, there are legit fish tacos (I tried a bite! They're good enough!), as well as veggie burgers.   So there. You have no excuses to avoid this amazing, amazing restaurant. Enjoy!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I dined here for lunch after several friends recommended the place to us, so we had very high expectations. The menu was very extensive and nearly overwhelming, and our waitress had come by twice to take our order but I wasn't ready yet, so I felt a bit rushed and quickly chose the PB&J and bacon burger.  However upon biting into the burger, I realized there was something very important I had missed in the item description - the burger has quite a significant amount of sriracha sauce on it. I have no tolerance for spicy food whatsoever, so after that one bite I asked if I could get another one and the waitress happily obliged. Now, I fully understand that was my fault for not reading the full description before ordering, and while I think it's rather silly to put sriracha on a burger with peanut butter and jelly to begin with and makes a rather terrible combination, still my bad.  So the waitress brought out a new burger minus the sriracha and it was good, my boyfriend enjoyed his burger, and all was well.... until we got the bill. They'd charged us for TWO of the PB&J burgers, which was each about $11. Also keep in mind the waitress took the first burger as soon as I reordered, so it's not even like we got to keep it - we had to pay an extra $11 for one bite of a burger I couldn't eat. If we'd known we'd be charged for both, which the waitress neglected to inform us of, then we would've kept the first one and my boyfriend would've had it later or something since he's fine with spicy food. Anyone who has worked in a restaurant before knows that if a customer dislikes a meal and needs it fixed or redone, the decent thing to do is to take the first one off their bill. I've had years of experience in customer service, both as an employee and a customer, and this is a very basic practice. But if Rehab Burger Therapy is going to be that money-hungry then we won't be coming back, and many of our friends who initially recommended this place were appalled as well and have also been scared off.",

My boyfriend and I got our dip first and then our wings a few minutes later. Within about five minutes of us getting our order Madelyn dropped off our check and said she'd take it when we were ready. We had barely touched our food and my boyfriend had only drank 3/4 of his beer. He had planned on getting another beer but Madelyn made it clear she was done taking care of us. If she had told me that it was the end of her shift and she wanted to go home I would have respected that and tabbed out. Instead she made us feel awkward about not finishing our meals and paying her faster.

The \"Rehab\" is 10 oz of ground beef and the \"Relapse\" burger is 5 oz of ground beef - the absolute perfect size for ladies. My faves...\"Mushroom and Swiss burger\" and the \"Spicy Mac and Cheese burger\".  They also have a Veggie burger, Turkey burger, and multiple sandwiches.  The restaurant itself is a very laid back vibe. There is seating inside and outside and these beautiful Spring nights make sitting outside an even better experience.

    "text": "Hi had a terrible experience dining at this location.  We ordered bloody mary's and the spicy one was not spicy, the horseradish one contained little if any horseradish, the mixer was watered down and the pour was light.  When we ordered a double for round two the waitress spilt most of the booze on the floor.  The chili cheese fries....  huge portion of not delicious.  Canned cheese product, kidney beans, and marinara sauce.  We nibbled on these for 30 minutes waiting on our burgers while they severed the rest of the restaurant.  By the time our main course arrived, we were so unhappy they comped our meal and we left.  My hamburger was raw.  I did not eat it, but I shudder to think what would have happened to me if I did.  Beware the coleslaw.  We took one bite and decided there was something sketchy about it.  We had been looking forward to trying this place for months and it was the worst dining experience of my life.  We only went here because the wait in Scottsdale was an hour plus.  There's a reason.",

I think our server was new as he kept forgetting things and the tables around us seemed to be thinking the same thing. Besides the sub-par service, I was really looking forward to trying the pot brownie dessert and it looks and sounds delicious. It was very disappointing. The brownie tasted like something you'd buy frozen and microwave :/ I wouldn't say that I will never go here again, but don't see myself going out of my way. Definitely worth a visit for some good burgers if you've never been!",

I was worried about driving to Scottsdale on a Saturday night, and having it be packed with a long wait. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned there was a location only a few blocks away from where we were! I called to ask what the wait looked like and was told they were busy- but there were a few spots at the bar open. Kassie at the bar was so kind on the phone, and since we were on our way, and two blocks away, she said she would hold a couple spots for us. I was shocked, that was so thoughtful of her, and it made me feel taken care of, and welcome before I ever stepped through the doors. This location exceeded my already high expectations, and it didn't disappoint in any way. The PBJ burger is my all time favorite and can't be missed. Amazing food! Perfection in the burgers all the way. The staff and vibe are so welcoming, and the customer service was simply awesome. Ian was our server and even brought us a small side of his favorite sauce to try for dipping the yummy sweet potato tots.***!! It's the little things that make the biggest impact. Special thanks to Kim, Ian, and Kassie- You made our dinner date perfect! We will be back- I'll be dreaming of pretzel buns, tots, and PB until we do:)",

    "text": "We went to the Tempe location recently on a Friday night at 6-7 pm. We were excited to try this place. I love burgers!! The place is fun looking.  After being seated and given menus our waitress asked is what we wanted to drink. When I asked what was in a tropical named drink she said \"I don't know , probably tropically things like,pineapple or coconut\". Now I think the menu should break down signature drinks but it does not, but the waitress should know. Now I know it was a new location and she's likely new, so I would have had no issue w her saying, sorry I am new, I'm not a 100%sure what's in it, so let me ask the bartender (now this would have been VERY simple  as we were at a table RIGHT next to the bar) she completely blew us off and did not even attempt to figure out what the drink was made of. I assume restaurants mAke a good profit off of the alcohol. We did not order any due to this. Next, I order a burger on brioche.... sorry they were out and only had pretzel or wheat . This seemed quite odd to me as this was early Friday night and I assume brioche is pretty popular. I didn't end up ordering a burger due to that. I know it sounds picky but I would think a burger restaurant would have that and it was what I wanted. The prices were good but service was not. Sadly I left hungry and disappointed. Maybe we will try again later.",

We had a Hatch chili burger, bacon bleu with pretzel bun and a chicken sandwich.  They were cooked as ordered but the beef, toppings nor bread had any great flavor to speak of.  Not bad, just not good. Service was timely and polite and friendly .  The atmosphere - specifically the menu design is very chain restaurant-like (hokey).  Looks like a good place to have a couple beers.   The bigger issue was the staff dress.  The hostess was awful.  She was wearing an ill-fitting tank top and tights.  There was another waitress who was wearing a sleeveless t-shirt.  But she also had something tying the shirt back in such a way that her back was showing off a large tattoo but also ridiculous side-boob.  Trashy in general but disgusting as a food server.  Not sure if everyone got cold suddenly or the manager made them cover up as these two had jackets on when we left.",

    "text": "I think I may need to go to Rehab after eating this burger!  Just kidding.  I like the way they have a Hawaiian theme going on in here.  Guess everyone would like to rehab in Hawaii!  When I arrived, the host asked how many were in my party, I told him 9.  He said he's never seated a party that large before.  Hmmm.  Ok.  So, after discussing it with another person, they arranged to seat us just past the bar.  It worked out great!  They do have patio seating which might have been a better option, but I don't like any amount of warm weather, so I chose to be seated indoors.  The place was fairly easy to find, but it is located almost right next to the border of the ASU Campus. There's a parking garage on 6th Street (not free) if you can't find street parking.    To dive into this place, figuring out what you want may be a feat in itself!  They offer so many types of burgers, some sound super crazy!  Don't worry, if you don't want a burger, they do offer salads, wings, pastas, and other sandwiches.  The Rehab size is a 10oz burger and the Relapse size is a 5 oz burger.  The cost difference is only $2.00, so it's worth it to get the Rehab size.  The burgers are just overloaded with so much stuff, it is almost easier to deconstruct it while eating it!  It's like getting an extra side!  I got a Hatch Burger (Relapse) with Ghost Pepper Jack Cheese.  They will make substitutions for you, or at least they did for me.  It was a very good burger because it was just like a cheeseburger with a chili, not over the top with toppings!  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their burgers, too!  You can change up or request extra sauces.  The Wasabi Mayo was killer!  Went extremely well with the Sweet PoTOTers!  Mmmmm!!  Here's a short funny... my Dad usually eats small items that are soft to chew.  He decided that a Tuna Salad Sammy would be harmless.  It was the tallest sandwich that was served!  Yes, it was soft, but he had to eat it with a fork to manage it better!    Being right off the ASU Campus, there is a bar in here, too.  I didn't take a look to see what all they offered, but I'm sure you can get something to suit you.  They do take a little while to get your food to you, but it wasn't a terribly long wait.  We kept busy talking and visiting with each other.  This would be a great place to come to if you are in the area!",

Menu options with fun names: gourmet burgers (10oz or 5oz)/sandwiches/pasta/salads and dessert. We tried the P&J burger/Meatloaf burger/Philly cheese burger/Tony Montana sandwich.  The burgers are HUGE & come with regular fries or sweet potato tots. Tip: skip fries & go for tots....YUMMM YUM! The sandwich is a black forrest ham with pulled pork on overly toasted bread (sigh), but still pretty good. We left very stuffed & satisfied. I'd like to go back & try other items, overall food is pretty good!",

    "text": "If they tried to make me go to Rehab Burger I might say Yes Yes Yes! I actually tried to go to the Scottsdale location a few months back but the wait to get a table was so long that we decided to eat somewhere else. We were in the area and saw that the Tempe location had just opened so we figured we should check it out!  The location is a bit hidden, right next to the Brickyard garage exit off of 6th Street. There is outdoor and indoor seating and in the winter they have heaters out if you do decide to eat on the patio. It was fairly busy when we came here on Saturday in the afternoon but we were able to get a seat with no wait.   The menu has an extensive selection of burgers and drinks. They have a daily happy hour from 11-6 which includes discounted drinks. Every burger can be made into a 5 oz relapse size or 10 oz rehab size, and there are multiple protein options, such as beef, turkey, and veggie patty. Feeling in a spicy mood, I opted for the ghost burger, labeled as such due to the inclusion of ghost pepper cheese. I tried some of the chili cheeseburger as well.  Since it was pretty busy it took some time for our orders to get out to our table. Service was good though as we were waiting and drinks were refilled as needed. The plates were impressive looking. The execution though left something to be desired. Our burgers were supposed to be medium rare but came out more like medium to medium well. The burger itself had a dense tough texture, not very juicy, and didn't have a lot of flavor in it aside from a faint taste of char from the grill. I did enjoy the guacamole but the cheese wasn't fully melted in the center of the burger and had a slight grainy texture. The ghost pepper in it was actually not too spicy. I'd say it was about the spiciness of a jalapeno. The pretzel bun was decent but I didn't really enjoy it with my particular burger.   The chili cheeseburger was admirably smothered in a large amount of chili. The taste itself was OK, nothing spectacular, and I had the same problem with the beef patty being too densely brick-like in texture and lacking in flavor.  The fries were light and crisp, dusted with some seasoned salt and very plentiful.  Since it was so busy they seemed a bit rushed for us to finish and get our table cleared. Everyone here though was friendly and attentive.  I'll give them another try; maybe another type of burger will taste better.",

Our waiter came over a few minutes later to take our drink orders. Upon receiving my drink, I noticed that the glass I was given was dirty. I informed the waiter took it back to get me another one. At this time my wife had ordered a beer as well. I received my beer fairly quickly, but she did not receive hers. We had then reminded him of this, he said he would get on this.   We then went to ordering. We ordered a quesadilla for an appetizer, two hamburgers with veggie Patty's, and an order of their spicy Mac & Cheese without the bacon. After putting in our order, we reminded the waiter AGAIN that my wife hadn't received her beer.   The quesadilla had came, and my wife still hadn't received her beer. We did not have an silverware or napkins, so we also asked for these. Finally, my wife's beer had arrived. She ordered a pint of Blue Moon, which usually comes garnished with an orange slices, but there was not one on it. This isn't the most important thing, but was disappointing.   Our burgers and side of Mac and Cheese came maybe 5 minutes after getting the appetizer. This sounds like fast service, but we were expecting to have more time to enjoy the rest of the appetizer before our burgers came. So now our burgers had to get cold while we finished our quesadilla. I instantly noticed the Mac and Cheese had bacon in it, so we had to send it back. We also noticed that the buns we order on our burgers we're on the wrong burger. At this time we still hadn't received napkins or silverware.   The waiter finally came back with the Mac and Cheese, and silverware!   After taking one bite of the Mac and Cheese, we had realized that it was unedible. We had asked the waiter if they microwave their Mac and Cheese, he informed us that they don't, but it really tasted like they did. As far as the burgers go, they did not taste at all what we we're hoping for. For $15 a burger, these we're a HUGE disappointment.   Overall, I do not think we will ever be back. We would try another location, since they have multiple in the valley, but at this point I would just have to say to AVOID.",

I think I might come here for dinner for the rest of my life. I'm so passionate about this place now idek.  Screw engineering. I want a degree in rehab burger therapy.",

They ask what you want to burger cooked to i.e. medium rare but all three of our burgers tonight were over cooked. they also seem kind of dry and the pretzel bun was too big and dry.  The sweet potato tater tots tasted like they were overcooked as well as the meat in the burger.  We got the Hawaiian burger, the pork store, and my wife and I split their awesome (usually) peanut butter and jelly burger.  I always take my out of town guests to the restaurant to show off what Arizona is all about, but tonight the food was just not good, I did not want to complain to the waitress because the service was good as usual but the burgers just did not taste good.  The burger was actually not cooked like it normally was at this restaurant, not sure if they have new cooks in the back or what but just did not taste right.  Moved the review down to a one star due to owner/location not reaching out on behalf of my review.",

Add some of the Aioli sauce and you have a wild flavor combo. The burger was cooked perfectly and the buns are so fresh and tasty.  For the gluten free crowd they have several options. You can do a lettuce wrap or they have a gluten free bun too.   My biggest regret is filling up on the burger and fries. I would love to go back and try the pot brownies.

Environment: it's pretty chill in here, I decide to sit outside for my meal, the lights and high tables are cute.   Appetizer: I ordered the onion ring. I would say the onion ring here is a must have if you come over, I haven't seem this huge of onion ring in my life, super satisfied!  Burger: I order the spicy Mac&cheese burger, side with sweet potato. Mac&cheese has crunchy bacon on top, the burger portion was so huge, 5 oz is definitely good for 2 people. Sweet potato is so good with their homemade special sauce.  Service: my waiter was so friendly, he come to check on us like three times, he gave advices on the choices. I left my cigarettes on my table, he ran and gave it back to me. Love him!   I'll recommend this place to all of my friends.",

The festival was going on, so we had a bit of a walk to the restaurant, which was not a big deal, and it helped to increase our hunger.  We were pleasantly surprised by this place.  The decor is fun.  The service was super friendly.  Got sat just as we walked in, and even though the place was hoppin', our meal was served quite fast.  We both order the BYOB (build your own burger).  Mine was piled high and cooked to perfection (i always ask for medium).  The right amount of the toppings I picked, and the sauces added to the flavor, of course.  Did not order any special drinks or desserts.  The burgers were so big that it was enough for our meal.  For a restaurant near the college, it was not bad (as far as rowdiness).  It might become our favorite place for a hamburger from now on. :)",

    "text": "Finally went to this place after many people told me to check it out.  We left thinking about all the people we plan to bring back. There are all the wild and crazy burger options that fit the needs of everyone. The most popular burger is the PBJ burger and my husband had it-- was good he said! I tried the veggie burger with the onion rings and BBQ sauce topper. I liked it! The veggie burger is a fried panko bread crumb and black bean patty. It was a bit hard to judge the flavor since it was doused in BBQ sauce (which is how I like it), but I do wish it weren't fried.   Tip for kids: They don't have a kid's menu, but you can order half orders of PBJ or grilled cheese (what we ordered, and also mac'n'cheese and other items I can't remember). They are HUGE portions and I would've been full on the half order of grilled cheese or PBJ! The even come with fries and were only like $3.25 each.   I changed my mind and upgraded my fries to Jamaican corn at the last minute because I saw it come out on another person's plate (was DELISH, btw) and they brought me that WITH the fries at no additional charge. Super kind of them considering I was the one who made the mistake in ordering late.  The portions are huge, the food is pretty good and the prices are super reasonable considering that burger is very likely to serve as two meals for you!  Can't wait to head back!",

    "text": "I feel terrible writing this review as I have long been a fan of rehab. I dine often at the Scottsdale location and order delivery through grub hub often. Generally there are no issues. Tonight was another story.   I ordered a bacon bleu cheese burger through grub hub, and upon arrival, I noticed that between the buns there was only a patty. Nothing more. Upon contacting grub hub, they spoke to the restaurant and were advised that the bacon and bleu cheese was inside the burger.  Ok cool. The description was wrong on grub hub. It didn't say anything about it being stuffed. But I'm cool with that. Bacon and bleu cheese stuffed burgers are some of my favorite burgers to make.  I look at the patty again, and still don't think it looks right. I work with meat on a daily basis, and I have made a lot of burgers (stuffed and not) during my time. I proceed to open the burger and examine it. Not a shred of bacon or bleu cheese. I'm very familiar with rehab's regular pattys and this was one of them.   I contacted grub hub again, and they reached out to the restaurant. They came back to tell me that the manager would not issue a refund for the burger I was incredibly unhappy with. I explained to them that neither of the components that make up the bacon bleu burger were included, but that say that there was nothing they could do as the manager would not allow a refund.  I work for one of the highest rated restaurants on Yelp, and we would never treat a guest like that. Even if they were clearly wrong. I'm not trying to scam them for a free burger. I love rehab and love supporting local business, but tonight I feel like the customer service ball was dropped.  Just finished eating the burger after I added some ingredients at home. Didn't taste any bacon or bleu cheese at all.  I don't see myself repeating my business there again soon.",

It was served with a side of sweet potato tots. The portion was so huge, that I'd recommend sharing dinner so you can share a milkshake for dessert. Mmm.",

With a large number of burger creations (and they also have other items), it was hard to decide on what burgers to get. We settled on the Bigger Beefstro Burger and the BYOB (build your own burger). Tip: unless you're really hungry or have a big appetite, the single patty \"relapse\" size is plenty filling.  Short verdict: the hype about how good the burgers are accurate.  The fries are average.  I thought the sweet potato taters were better than the fries with a crispy coating covering the soft interior.  The many positive reviews left by other Yelpers are spot on.

    "text": "Spending a couple of days in Tempe AZ with my Honey for a conference and stoked to be without the kids and with time to catch up on Yelp!  I have family in the area that loves this burger joint and was super excited to give it a whirl. It has a casual vibe similar to Islands (one of my all time fave burger spots).  We happened to come in during happy hour and imbibed on a couple of cocktails. I had the Margatini ($8) which is made with a shot of Patron, fresh lime juice and a splash of love. Not sure what the splash of love was- I'm guessing bubbly water?   My fella got the Mike Tai ($7) which is a classic mai tai. Happy hour prices on these particular cocktails are $2 off.   We both had a hard time choosing a burger since the menu is pretty extensive. I settled on the Hangover Burger which you can order in a 10 oz. patty (Rehab size) or the 5 oz. patty (Relapse size). You can also substitute any Rehab burger with a turkey burger, grilled chicken breast, a beef chorizo patty or veggie burger at no extra charge.   I ended choosing the Relapse Hangover Burger ($13.75) which comes with a fried egg, bacon, Colby jack cheese, and hatch green chili. The burger was really tasty, but in hindsight I played it pretty safe and wish I had been a bit more adventurous since there are some really interesting burgers on the menu!   My husband ordered the Relapse Hawaiian burger. ($10.75) It came with a patty topped with Black Forest ham, Swiss cheese, grilled pineapple and a side of Teriyaki aioli. He didn't really care for this one and misread the side of aioli thinking it came drizzled with teriyaki sauce. I would've made the same mistake based on the name of the burger alone. I had a few bites of this one and it was just okay, he had half my burger and liked mine better.   Overall, it was a good burger place to try. I'm  tempted to give it another shot before we leave. May have to talk my fella into it first!   FYI The Relapse size burger patty isn't as photo-worthy as the Rehab size keep that in mind when ordering. Lol ;)",

I went for dinner with a colleague and we looked over the menu choices and were quite surprised at first. Peanut butter Jelly and Mac and cheese burger were some of the choices! We were stumped between the two and which one to go with so we each got the opposite and spilt it in half! The saying ,\" Oh so wrong, but oh so right!\" absolutely applied to these burgers! All the different flavors somehow just went well with each other! The peanut butter was a melty consistency against the meat with just enough jelly. The macaroni my personal favorite was actually really good macaroni alone, and amazing inside the burger! If you're in the area and wanting a really good burger with a twist definitely give them a try!",

This time, I came during peak dinner time on a Friday, and I went again on a Saturday for their special maple bacon donut burger! Both times we were served without a hitch. We had great customer service and I was really REALLY happy with my food. Their sweet potato tots are so good and I love that you can order TONS of sauce.  I am meticulously checking their social media to see if there are any fun special burgers coming up, because I don't want to miss out! They usually have a special or unique burger that's only available on Saturday/Sunday. (I learned the hard way that they don't serve the special burger on Fridays... hence the reason I went 2x in one weekend, lol!)  The only thing I noticed going two days in a row is that their rare/medium rare cooking is a little inconsistent. On Friday, the medium rare was already a little bloody. But on Saturday, the medium rare was different. Just something my boyfriend noticed. (I got rare both times and had no complaints.)  I also wish they validated parking!",

The waitress recommended the Chipotle aioli instead of Ketchup and I'm glad she did; it was a novel and delicious flavor pairing.   Overall a delicious burger and large portions.

I don't like bashing a restaurant for service, but this was extremely slow.  Burger and fries were very good and would come back again, maybe just need to communicate our plans to be prompt.

    "text": "I was stoked to check out Rehab--I'd heard really great things about it from a handful of people, it's close to my house, and they offer happy hour every day for those jabronies who work M-F, 9-5 (don't worry, I'm definitely one of these jabronies). But the experience as a whole was pretty underwhelming.   So to begin with, Rehab is on a pretty busy corner of Mill. Totally fine, and not at all a complain, just something to note if you're planning on driving. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious, with a huge bar, plenty of inside tables, and a sizable patio--bonus points for tons of TVs so you can shout at your favorite sports team from wherever you're seated.   We came here late afternoon on a Saturday, so it wasn't very busy at all. In fact, there seemed to be equal number of patrons and employees in the building. We were immediately seated and our drink orders taken pretty quickly; all standard stuff. But then our waiter didn't come back to take our food orders for probably another 15 minutes. Would've been fine and understandable if they were busy, but they definitely were not at all. After placing our food order, it didn't come out for another 40 minutes. What? It's a couple o' burgers. Again, would've made sense if they were slammed, but we were one of a dozen tables in there. Our server was very nice, but overall we were pretty disappointed by the lack of attention... And we are not typically people who want a whole ton of chattin' with our servers.   As for the burgers themselves, they were fine. I had the Mac Gnarly, a pretty simple burger in comparison to the rest of the menu, but I was feelin' it. I got the relapse (smaller) size because I am a small human, and it was still a ton of food for me. And super messy, but I can't hold my lack of grace against Rehab. It was a perfectly fine burger, just nothing particularly special. I feel like if I'm ever going to pay $10+ for a burger, I'm expecting it to knock my socks off. It was just fine. And a little bit closer to well done than my request for medium doneness, but that's not a huge deal. The fella had the Know Poblano on a gluten free bun. He had a pretty similar summation of it: perfectly fine, but not mind-blowing. He did, however, say it was one of the better gluten free buns he's ever had.   I will say that I really enjoyed the fries. Seasoned, but not too salty, and very crispy but still with a good amount of potato in there, they were very tasty. Pro tip: dip 'em in dat chipotle mayo. The sweet poTOToes were also tasty, and I don't generally care for them.   Overall, we were just expecting more from Rehab. Maybe we just happened upon an off day for them, but it's hard not to be a little bummed to pay a little more than standard for a burger that's a little lacking. At this price point, I'll be sticking to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers.",

I've decided one of my life goals is to try every burger on the menu.   So far my favorite is the PB&J bacon burger--it sounds insane, but it's just insanely good! The Mac and Cheese burger is bomb too! I love the pretzel bun. Sweet potato tots with their special sweet sauce is heaven. The fries are delicious too, so either choice is a win. You can eat lighter and choose healthy subs like a salad for your side, and a smaller patty with a whole wheat bun.  Last time I was there, I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink before heading out to a comedy show with friends. I just knew it was cold outside, I was getting sick, and I needed a boost of energy. The bartender custom made my drink: coffee, peppermint liqueur, whiskey, and whipped cream. It was one of the best Winter drinks I've ever had! Every server I've encountered here seems to enjoy working here, they are helpful figuring out what to order and always friendly.   The bathroom offers fresh hand towels, perfect for freshening up after a hike at nearby ASU mountain. Reggae/rock music for an awesome island vibe. A full bar, outdoor seating, and tucked away from the noisy nightlife of Mill Ave, but close enough too all the action that DT Tempe has to offer.   I'm hooked! You just have to try it!",

    "text": "In town for a long weekend with ma' boys for spring training.  Dodger game was sold out so we wound up going to the Giants game which is a few blocks from Old Town Scottsdale.  Snuck out of the game in the top of the 8th because all the starters we're out.  Wandered those few blocks back into town and stumbled into Burger Rehab Therapy.  Got a table just in time as the \"after game rush\" was a few minutes behind us.  The place was buzzing.  Staff was pleasant, fun and attentive.  Reasonably priced drinks were ordered, served quickly, and tasted wonderful.  Second round was ordered immediately and again served in a flash.  For me, music can add or subtract from a dining experience. For this encounter it was a big plus.  Good classic rock & roll, the Stones, U2, the Eagles, and for good measure they threw in some Beach Boys.  The only thing missing was Stairway to Heaven and Free Bird. The place was filling up fast with the \"tardy goers\" but I didn't notice any change in the pace at which our troop was being taken care of.  We reviewed the menu and discussed the many choices with each other as well as the servers.  They were happy to outline the choices in detail and include the \"extras\" locals (not us) usually enjoy.  This was a big help in deciding.  Among the squad we wound up going all burger.  No shrubs or calamari for these cavemen.  Again the service was stellar.  Quick and on point. Burgers were cooked as ordered.  The man-boys had the Porkster, the Hangover and the B.Y.O.B. We had onion rings, skin-on fries, sweet potato tater tots and Jamaican Corn.  I went way off the radar and had the PB& J Bacon Burger on Brioche.  Oh my word! It was sloppy. It was sweet. Couple that with bacon, cheese and a well cooked beef patty and it was hands down the craziest and one of the best burgers I have had in a long time.  It was a sticky, sweet, savory, tasty, mess of a burger. I felt I needed to take a shower afterwards because that peanut butter was everywhere.  Even found a little behind my ear the next day at the Angels game.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone that wants to relax, enjoy a good meal, enjoy some music and make new friends.  Can't wait for spring training 2019.  Save a taco, eat a burger!",

    "text": "***Update 2019.7.11*** It's been a while since I've been here because I live farther away but I convinced my co-workers to try it out. I had the spicy Mac& cheese burger again and it was just as great I'd as I remember it being.   Also, our waitress (the one with short dark hair and a pretty smile) was great.  *****************  I've been trying to get over to this place since I moved to Arizona 2 years ago.  Starting off I think the beach bar was fun and not over the top with the surf boards and Tiki bar decor. I noticed a very reasonably sized bar right when we walked in which is very convenient if you just want drinks and a little food.  The place was packed and we only had to wait a bit because all the low tables were in use and we had someone in a wheelchair with us. It wasn't too long of a wait and the food would have made a longer wait worth it.  I'm a beer snob so the selection was pedestrian at best but their specialty drinks and hard liquor selection makes up for the lack of high end beers (I didn't show up for the booze though).  We ordered the pig wings appetizer which were melt in your mouth good. We ate the appetizer so fast that the timing for the main entree seemed long but was, in reality, reasonable.   I ordered the spicy mac n cheese 10oz burger and fries with the pretzel bun. My first thought when the plate arrived was that the food pics I've seen match the grandeur with which I was presented. Also, my burger was cooked medium which may be too much. Next time medium rare (and I usually like meat well done). I also think that the 5oz option is more sensible unless you are 20 years old and really hungry. The fries with the chipotle ranch were cooked well and complimented the whole meal ( I didn't have that \"I loved the burger hate the fries experience I was expecting\"). There was even a huge tasty dill pickle spear served on the side.  The next burger on my list will be the PB&J with Sriracha.",

We started off with the philly chz fries (half order). & oh my goodness, they were freakin fireeee. I could have just gotten this as my meal & would have been completely satisfied haha.   I decided to order the spicy mac n chz burger, rehab size. And my girl got the Hawaiian burger, same size. These burgers were so much better than what I expected them to be. And they're so huge! When our food got to the table, I thought to myself that I should of just ordered the relapse size because the rehab was so much bigger that I thought it would be. Both burgers were really good. Cooked to order. Great flavor as well.  Their fries on the other hand are just bomb in general. They out some type of seasoning on them that make them so delicious. We were trying to figure out what kinda seasoning it was but it definitely was something different from anything we've ever tried before. It had a tangy lime salt taste to them but they were really good.   Service was great. Parking can be a pain though!",

Rehab is right in downtown Tempe where it gets a little crazy in the evening's with the college nearby and it's a party scene in this area most nights. Parking can be hard to find, or you can pay for parking in the garage that's within walking distance. The food is amazing. The burger with mac n cheese is a bit of a mess to eat but such a great gluttony menu item. I tried a few other burgers/sandwiches and the chicken wings are really good here too. There's a full bar and several beers on tap. The decor makes you feel like your near the beach. Overall this is a must try..",

    "text": "How does that Amy Winehouse song go? Tried to make me go, but I said no no no?   My four colleagues and I stopped in for a lunch break, at the special request of one particular burger-loving guy who seriously needs therapy. Interior decor was funky, the menu looked great, and we were excited to get down to ordering and devouring.   We made quick decisions of a grilled cheese with pepper jack and side salad with chipotle ranch (me), spicy chicken wings with fries, Philly cheeseburger, and jalapeno popper burger with tots. That's where our high ended and the downer kicked in.   Sadly, we waited and waited and waited for about 25 minutes for our food to arrive. This was weird because there were only like 4 tables with patrons at that point, and a couple people sitting at the bar. By the time our food arrived, we need to run out the door in order not to be late for a meeting (which we still were, darn it). As the food was delivered, we immediately boxed up our plates to go, and then still had to wait for the check.   When I finally got to eat my GC, I was disappointed by the ratio of bread (way too thick) to cheese (way too little just melted in the middle). The salad was fine. My meat-loving colleague was pleased with his enormous cheesesteak burger, spilling out the sides of the bun. My other colleagues were disappointed not to be able to eat their meals hot and fresh, rather from the to-go container on the run and cooled.  Our server was nice and I don't blame her for the ridiculously long wait (not sure what was going on back in the kitchen). But also, she never came back to give us any status updates. It really would've been nice to know the timeframe rather than sitting there feeling forgotten and frustrated. We could have ordered a beer or an appetizer to pass the time and satiate our hunger. Alas, nada.   I had higher hopes, but this rehab 1-step program worked and I won't be back.",

To start, I asked my waiter for a few straws and he took them out of the wrapper and put his hands all over it and then put them in our drinks. Out of three of us, no one enjoyed our meal. Not to mention one of us got like double the fries, sucks bc that was the only good thing on my plate. Also the parking situation is terrible. It's $6 and if you forget your ticket you're screwed. My other dining partner had to get a new ticket and paid $12 for parking. More than the burger even was and it wasn't worth it. If you want a decent burger for a third less of the price, go to Chuckbox down the road. Free parking and a muchhhhh better burger.",

Although the chile was mild, it had a spice to the taste which is more than any other chile served here in Phoenix.   Brad who is more adventurous ordered the spicy mac and cheese burger. WOW. The burger came out with a hefty serving of mac and cheese on top of the burger. Of course it had to have a pretzel bun. I tasted the mac and cheese and decided it was quite good.   The burger is a mix of several types of ground meats. Whatever the mix is, it works! I ordered my burger well done, since you can never be too careful with beef. Next time I will go with medium. This burger is that good. No need for worries. The meat is high quality. The fries that came with my burger were good. Skin on. Brad ordered onion rings. WOW WOW WOW! The onion is HUGE! The batter is light. You definitely need a fork and knife to eat these! They were the best we have tried in a long time.   For parking we parked in the garage on 6th/Mill. Short walk to Rehab.",

We got a side of onion rings and they were very tasty but they had more hard breading than I like. I prefer a thinner more delicate  breading.  The fries were top notch; nothing to complain about.  Over all, if you are in the mood for a great big burger and fries, you can't go wrong with Rehab.",

    "text": "I called ahead to make sure they were open today because last time we got there and they were closed on Mondays. We only had about an hour for 2 of the 6 of us. We got seated right away and got some iced tea and Diet Coke right away but it took at least 10 minutes to get some waters after I flagged the waitress down for the other 4 that met up with us. The server sat us at the big table for 6 but the last 4 people took a couple MInutes to find the place after having a little trouble with the underground parking garage and street meter. Not very convenient for those driving in. We paid 6 dollars for the underground parking and there is no validation. The parking garage must be owned by the city or privately. The food was pretty good but I've had better. The music was loud. It was hard to hear each other. The decor was very cute. The prices were decent for the prime location in downtown Tempe. It's a good thing our son asked for his salad in a to go container because it didn't come out until he had to leave. Service was slow, especially for July when ASU isn't even in session. Seemed like at least 20 to 30 minutes after we ordered that we got our food. We tried it but i don't think we will be back. Nice people though",

Only thing - if I had to find one....I got a choice between a 5 ounce and a 10 ounce burger. I chose the ten because the five was just too small for a guy my size. Whoa nelly, that was a hunk of meat. Probably more than I needed. But boy, I left there well fed and happy. Also, my wife got the black bean burger. Said it was about the best she's ever had.",

I'll probably go back to try one. Instead we had a couple of beers and the Calamari app. Being strips I was hoping for some thick cut, lightly bread, tender morsels. Instead we got thin short pieces, heavily breaded and very over cooked. Include a Marinara sauce that is so thick it's takes a spoon to dig it out of the bowl, and you've got meal frustration galore. We ended up asking for some Ranch and Blue Cheese dressing instead which help a great deal. Though to be very honest, a spicy thinner sauce, like a Thai Chili or even a good Salsa would have been much better. The server was great though she took her time getting to us and checking on us as we ate. If you go, try a Burger. They looked like the best option for something satisfying.",

We love the option of two sizes of burgers and salads. Relapse vs Rehab.   On a whim we tried a different burger. It was our first time ordering the Pablano burger.

    "text": "I've been to the Scottsdale location but this was our first time to Tempe Rehab. It was Thursday all day Happy Hour so we enjoyed a couple of Four Peaks drafts for a decent price. My wife's Hatch Burger (she got the relapse size - 5 oz) was outstanding. The chile on top was grilled, with a bit of smoky flavor. I opted for the Hawaiian burger (rehab size - 10 oz). It was huge with a large grilled pineapple slice on top.   I had ordered it well done and, unfortunately, it came out still very red throughout. If it had been close I would have normally accepted it but I had to send it back. The waitress apologized and quickly took the burger back. I kept the plate of fries so I would have something to nibble on while I was waiting. A couple of minutes later, the manager came out and apologized about the mixup. She offered me a side salad or something while I waited. Because I had the fries I declined. She also said, \"of course, when you get your burger back this will be on me.\" The manager also came around a few minutes later to refill our water glasses. A few minutes later the waitress came by to say the burger would only be another couple of minutes. When it arrived it was cooked perfectly.   I'm going into a lot of detail about this because this is how you want to be treated when things don't go right. I did not expect to be comp'ed for the burger but it was a really nice touch. BTW, the burger was delicious, especially with the pineapple teriyaki aioli.  I'm not a gourmet and so as long as the food tastes good, the thing that matters most to me is the service. This one was top notch.",

It took about 10 minutes for anyone to come over to our table to ask about drinks or anything. We ordered a chili burger, build your own burger and a hot dog. The chili was very plain with lots of tomatoes. I'd have to say this is the first restaurant where my kids didn't devour the French fries. They have an odd seasoning salt of them.  The food was okay. I thought the prices were reasonable. The service could have been better. Our server was super nice. Overall super slow. We may try again, not sure. Definitely worth at least trying once.   The easiest way to find is to access 6th street off of Mill Ave.  They are next to the parking garage.",

Today I had the special Meatloaf Mash and it was the bomb! It needs a permanent place on the menu.   The 10oz burgers (or larger) are infinitely better tasting in my opinion. They are more flavorful and more moist. I order medium rare and the 5oz always seems dry. I almost quit going, but you know...chasing that first date fun is a hard thing and I couldn't give up. And of course the 10oz are too damn big for an average human, hence my love hate relationship. However, due to this issue we have discovered a few other treats they have to offer and highly recommend both the tuna and the club.   Oh and the sweet potato fries with teriyaki pineapple sauce means you don't even need to order dessert.",

Servers were nice and attentive, spending time answering our questions.   They took care of our needs with haste. We ordered sweet potato fries, regular fries, and onion rings as well as a margatini.  potatoe fries I didn't care for.  The sauce didn't make it any better as well, which is disappointing.  The fries and onion rings were good, nice and crunchy but not oily at all.  The sauces were good especially when mixed with the hot sauces they had there.  Then we ordered a to go ghost pepper burger which was really spicy.  Didn't care for that too much. The margarita was strong and hit the spot most definitely. Overall the vibe was nice.  Cool little hangout for th3 college kids there.  Service was excellent.  Food made it a 4 out 5 star rather than a 5 starbut overall it was q nice experience",

We came in on a Thursday night around 6 or 6:30 so it was pretty relaxed and wasn't all that slammed aside from a company party sitting at the middle table.   I had a Burger with a hatch chili on it and it was pretty good. One thing you always fear in burger shops in if they are going to cook your burger properly but mine was cooked perfect and so was the persons who came with me. The fries were good as well. Again no complaints.   I know you are probably thinking, well you didn't complain about anything so why not 5 stars? Well the food was good. But it didn't wow me or anything. The food was good for the price and the service was great. Not the best burger I have ever had and definitely not the worst.   The only caveat here is that if you are interested in just grabbing some food here it can be a bit of a pain because it is on Mill basically which means parking is extremely limited and you will more than likely have to pay to park to get here.   Again, overall good quality place.",

My mom ordered the Philly cheese steak burger and I got the mushroom and swiss burger. We both chose fries over the sweet potato tots. Both burgers were cooked to order and perfect! Service was friendly and they kept up on our drink refills too. This place has a very hawaiian vibe. It feels happy and beachy, I like it! Reminds me of San Diego, which I love. They have some really interesting burgers to choose from like the Mac&Cheese burger, the PBJ & Bacon burger or the Tracker Pulled Pork burger. Don't worry, they still have traditional burgers too or you can build your own. So, if you're on Mill Ave and really need a good burger fix, this place would be a great choice!",

Something they leave out of the title is that there is a small bit of sriracha mixed in and as crazy as all this sounds (peanut butter, jelly, sriracha, burger) it is SO GOOD. If you know anything about food experimentation, the oddest combinations make some good tastes. Cheese and chocolate, bacon and syrup, cottage cheese and chili cheese fritos. The PB & J Burger is up there with it! But this iconic burger is not the only thing to come here for, all their unique burger choices sound amazing. I literally had to ask the waitress to come back two different times because I was so undecided on what to get! They all look so good and so do the appetizers ( be warned though. The burgers are huge and filling so only order apps and burgers if you're really hungry or eat a lot usually). The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the decor is dated and just screams \"Islands Burger knock off\" and the tables around ours were pretty filthy and set for people to sit down.   Also, REHAB BURGER EXEC CHEFS: please make a 4-6-8 Slider plate that can serve almost as a taster so we don't have to decide on one of your delicious burgers but can try a multitude for different kinds (great for sharing too) so when I come back I won't have to gamble on a burger I may not like. Just a golden idea I'll pass along for free",

They kept the same menu and decor as their other location, which is perfect because if something isn't broke, don't fix it! Rehab, you guys are my #1 burger place! Keep it up! :)  PS if this is your first time here, get the smaller burger, because the larger ones ARE HUGE! I recommend the Jalapeno Popper burger or The Hangover burger.

My burger was cooked perfectly; med rare and I was astonished, since my last experience was not cooked to how I ordered. These guys especially our server made an incredible effort to make our experience great. Thanks guys and we will be back for sure",

Been several times and always can only eat half.. so if you can agree on a burger with someone, best to go splitskies. If you follow then on Facebook, you get the inside intel on the special weekend burger creation they always have- stay tuned, there's some pretty cool stuff! Both fries and sweet potato tater tots are fantastic, you won't go wrong with either! Keep up the great work, Rehab!!",
