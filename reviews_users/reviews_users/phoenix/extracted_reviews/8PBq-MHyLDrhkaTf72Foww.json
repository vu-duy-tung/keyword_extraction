I order some taco and a corona. the server brought the corona first and I had it. the server recommended some taco and I order. they brought some chips and salsa. I sat had one or two chips. then the tacos came. I went to take the salsa to put on my tacos with my fork and the longest piece or hair was in the salsa. I immediately was sick to my stomach. I just have a thing when it come to hair. so the server ask if she can make me some fresh taco. after you find hair in your food. I don't want an thing else.  so she bring the bill and knock off half the food. when I did not eat ANY of the off. all yall who eat from here better check the salsa.

    "text": "Not much needs to be said about a bar devoted to being besotted.  The various signs with catch phrases and college colloquialisms attest to this.  \"I like your pants. Especially on my floor,\" says it all.    Perhaps a devoted patron of this bar would respond with \" Don't take life too seriously, you're not going to make it out alive,\" another turn of phrase that can be found mounted with Rocky Point pride in this establishment.  The atmosphere is meant to be very casual, laid back - like you were spending your spring break in Puerto Penasco.  But the similarities end there.  Quite possibly home of the worst house margarita - so full of the synthetic and syrupy sweet and sour mix that there is nothing more discernible.  Despite there being a full bar, the bartenders have little knowledge of cocktail recipes - I would recommend ordering beer by the bottle.  Although a full menu is available, there is no better word to describe the food than...bad.  If you have ever had a bonafide street taco in Mexico, then you will be dismally disappointed by their poor imitation.  One would assume that it is quite difficult to mess up a taco, but here they got everything wrong in both the preparation of the meat and the salsa that shamefully tried to mask the poor taste of the meat.    There is no need to dissect the menu or its gustatory offerings any further, as Dos is quite frankly a place to play beer pong and get wasted.  It does offer a variety of entertainments such as Tuesday comedy nights and Wednesday's Texas hold 'em.  Bean bag tournaments are also held here.  Dos certainly caters to a specific crowd, I am not one of those that feel as though they still want to be on spring break.",

The food is cheap, delicious, and there's an excellent patio that is awesome to sit on year-round.  The service can slack a bit when they're busy, but the wait staff seem to always make up for it.  The salsa is delicious, not too spicy, and extremely flavorful.  I've never had a complaint about their food and the drinks are on-point.  The outdoor patio is also dog friendly, which is really awesome.  And there are huge Jenga pieces and a bag toss game which is popular with the kids I've seen there.  I honestly don't know why this place only has three stars...give them a try.",

This bar is really close to my work so we frequent it for the after work to wind down from time to time.  I always have a really great time. I like the outdoor seating when the weather is nice, I like that they serve black beans on most of their items rather than refried, I like the cheap buckets of Pacifico during happy hour and I love that they have corn hole or bags or whatever other term people refer to it as.   The table service is always really great and the waitresses have always been friendly, I've never had a poor experience with the staff. Some of the people that go there are pretty big D Bags which is annoying, but since I'm usually with a group of co-workers, I really don't mind.  All in all, this isn't where I'd choose to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night, but I will definitely continue to stop in for happy hour on those days after work when I could really just use a drink!",

Once I heard that, I should of just left, but I stuck in there. I ordered a bucket of coronas, which you get 5 of. Happy hour it's 2.50 a piece, now I went on a Saturday night around 8pm. $20 bucks for 5 12 oz bottles. Now my mistake for not asking the price, but in my bar experiences, I never paid 20 bucks for 5 bottles. I also ordered 2 starry night shots, they cost me $6 bucks a piece. $6 bucks for a shot are you freaking kidding me!  It was my brothers birthday, that's why I didn't ask about prices, I thought it would be reasonable based on the reviews here. They even charged me for the $1 bday shot the bartender gave my brother. We didn't even ask for it. So as you can see I am pretty pissed about the whole experience. Also it was quite dead for it being a saturday night, but I don't blame people not coming there. Next time I'll stick to my regular spots.  $36 bucks got me: 5 coronas, 2 shots of starry night and a birthday shot out of a plunger (that's right, a toilet plunger)",

Not by how good it was, but by my experience at Dos Gringos.  I have no problems with the servers or the decor.  It was actually quite nice.  My problem was with the food.  I ordered a Carne Burrito with Red Sauce, which is something that I usually get when I am at an authentic mexican restaurant.  From the first bite, I knew that something was amiss.  The first complaint that I have was that the meat was raw.  Not Rare, Not Pink, but Full-on red.  I did not find this out until I was halfway done with the burrito; I thought that all the red juice was from the red sauce that I had ordered... I was wrong.  After asking for it to be recooked, they brought me back a new burrito.  Skeptical, I cut inside, just to take a look... Lo and Behold, more uncooked meat.  Now, at this point, I remember getting queasy.  Not only did I have food poisoning, but I was deeply sick from the raw meat that I had previously eaten.  Needless to say, I found myself in their restroom for an extended period of time.  I have not gone back since.  Some people that I Know believe that I would have a different experience if I returned, but that is not a chance that I will take.  Dos Gringos?  More like Don't Go-go.",

We ordered chips and salsa with a martini and beer. The chips were great but the martini tasted like juice so we decided to order two shots of my favorite grey goose vodka to get the alcohol kicking.   Things got awkward quickly because the shots tasted like water with a hint of alcohol. My husband hesitated on saying anything because we hate complaining but it was pretty disappointing.  When the bartender came by, my husband politely told him that he isn't trying to say that it was the bartenders fault but the shots we got tasted like water. The bartender immediately got annoyed. He just shrugged his shoulders and said he poured us shots and left it at that. My husband even said that he understands it's probably not the bartenders fault and that we didn't want anything else but thought it would be good for him to know. We've worked in restaurant before and know that sometimes management will water down the bottles. The bartender walked away and we got our check and left after paying.   Unfortunately, we won't be coming back to this place. it was really clear that the staff  had no interest in retaining new customers who were excited about finding a new place to enjoy their weekends.   When I worked in the restaurant business, I alway made sure that first time customers would be a returning customer. Our shots were $9/shot and that's pretty expensive when you feel like you drank water.",

We waited 10 minutes at our tables before we were helped. The bartender chuck is Amazing and always provides the best service!!!   *alex or aleyx (pronounced a-lex) was our server and we asked for all flour tacos-we later learned these are gringo style- and she gave us street style. I asked her if we could get the correct tacos and she said we ordered flour which is only flour, meat and onions. We went to the bartender, chuck, and asked and he said that gringo was flour with cheese, pico, meat and jalapeno salsa. Later she went up to him saying we ordered street style, which I know for 100% fact that we did not because I ALWAYS order flour tacos and they always come fully loaded. Bartender fixed it right away and left us happy customers!",

    "text": "We had high hopes...close to our hotel, and we were in town for the Cubs spring training. I mean, after all, they advertise at the games, so it has to be good right?  Ugh...  We went TWICE in 2 days - both times sat outside (on a Thursday and a Friday). Both times the smokers, omg...smokers everywhere outside. We live in Vegas and are used to smokers inside, in the casinos..but even this was over the top...50% smokers outside and no designated spot....nasty.  The happy hour specials are nice, especially the mini chimi's - very tasty!  But here's where the problems arise...the SERVICE. Seriously...between this place and a few others in town, all we can say about Tempe is, it's not a \"service town\". We had got awful terrible service last night - we wanted to stay longer and order more stuff,  but good lord, we could not get a water refill to save our lives (some random dude finally came and asked if he could refill them - TWICE!) and then we were so fed up due to lack of service we decided to leave and go back our hotel room (at 6 on a Friday nite!) instead of waiting around for the terrible service to come back our way.  Mini chimi's are great....Cadillac margaritas aren't great (tastes like the happy hour ones which were significantly cheaper we assume as we discovered the following night) but the SMOKE is terrible, We ordered Corona Light by the bucket and were served Corona instead. We waited a REALLY long time in between the server stopping by...really? There are also no fans running outside (allegedly there were broken per an overheard conversation) so you cannot go until the sun is down as it will shine on your table and be wretchedly hot!  It looks so fun from the street...and we could have spent a few more hours there, but for gods sake, we couldnt order anything else because our server just stopped coming to see us! We were so pissed off we wrote that on the receipt. My husband who has never written a YELP review in his life felt compelled to write one on this place.  Such high hopes...but ugh...did not live up to what we hoped for. Much better service in our own hotel room!",

It takes about 20 mins to order something on average and the waiter or waitress never checks up on you. Then, getting the bill is awful as well! It is like they forget about you!

Dining / drinking outdoors is one of my favorite things about Arizona - and for like 8 months out of the year, this is one of my favorite places to go to happy hour.

The only reason I returned was because it was so close to home and the tacos. One time visiting, it was happy hour and none of our drinks were discounted correctly and the server ordered the wrong food....instead of a manger apologizing, the server just said sorry and didnt do anything about it. Pretty professional. This very last time, I knew better, so I set a timer. It took 15 minutes until my friend got fed up and decided to ask a server if we could get some drinks. The drinks came instantly after that, meaning that they weren't busy. But after that, we were told our server would be by shortly for a food order. Another 22 minutes went by until we got another server's attention to get our food order. Some more time went by and our appetizer never arrived but the table in front of us that arrived AFTER us had already received their MAIN meal. We had to remind the server we even ordered an appetizer. She was too busy dancing and talking to the other server to realize we were there. Never offerred refills or asked how the food was, didnt even bring the check. We asked for the manger twice and no one stopped by, yet again. Never returning to this location. Worst service I have EVER experienced.  ***And I'm a server myself, so I can be empathic if it is busy but on all occasions, it was slow.",

Food was awful, I ordered the Gringo Wrap and gave up on it half way through. Our server followed up by pouring ice on me and delivering the wrong drinks to us. I informed her about the mistake and she apologized and left to bring me the correct drink. A few minutes later she returned to ask if we needed anything else, but still yet to deliver my correct drink. When I reminded her of this, she seemed upset and annoyed. Finally she returned with my correct drink (dos equis lager bottle). My date asked for the check and our server returned apologizing for the \"bad service\" and asked if she could \"get us anything for free\" because she didnt want us leaving \"with a bad taste in our mouth\". Too late, the Gringo Wrap already did that.  All in all, Im willing to write this off as a bad night for this server. It didnt appear busy to me, and I saw another server possibly training a third server. However it doesnt excuse the lack of management. No one ever came by to touch our table and ask how everything was. A capable manager should have at least helped this server run food and drinks.",

Good service from quality servers that remember you and what you like and drop it on you every time you grab a table.

And I will.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely horrible. Don't waste your time. We found a table that had less empty drinks and trash than the rest, waited about 10 minutes for a server to come clear the table. Took 15 minutes to get water. Brought out food (half the order because the other half had water spilled on it) and when we asked for more nacho cheese it took the waitress 20 minutes to bring back a tiny cup of shredded cheese. We NICELY asked for melted queso, the waitress rolled her eyes and brought back queso about 5 minutes later. The second half of our order came out and it was wrong. It was taken back and brought out correctly another 10 minutes later. THEN we were waiting and waiting for our check, 30 minutes after waiting my friend went inside to find our waitress and she was leaning against the wall talking to her coworkers. We asked for the check and explained that due to being at the restaurant for almost 2 hours, only ordering 2 appetizers, we would appreciate talking to the manager about the service. The manager refused to come to our table so my friend had to go inside to talk to him, he argued with her and told her she didn't know what she saw then asked \"well you got your food, didn't you? Then why are you here talking to me?\"  I'm appalled at this whole experience and wish I could give negative stars. I've never had such horrible service and been treated so poorly in my whole life.",

So that in itself is worth an extra star.  This time around : No one acknowledged us when we walked in. We had to seat ourselves. Our waitress was nice and did a decent job. The salsa was good but they charge for chips and salsa and charge extra for more salsa. But the food was good.   All in all, it's average ,So that is why my rank is still a 3/5 add an extra star for the manager who is striving for more.",

The outdoor seating provides a lovely area to relax with friends while enjoying some food and drinks. An added bonus was the outdoor games (I got to practice my mad Jenga skills). Everything was very reasonably priced. They had taco Tuesday going on, which I'm always a fan of and definitely took advance of.  The food was good and the drinks were strong. They also had some stand-up comedians preforming which was extremely entertaining. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Overall, a fabulous place to come for adult fun.",

We ordered (party of two) a total of four chicken-chorizo Monster Tacos. They were a good deal for their price point, but be sure to add a side of sour cream, quac and/or salsa as the tacos are bland AF.  Why the two stars for Dos Gringos? The service there is sslllloooowww. Es muy lento! From the time we arrived and were acknowledged to the random table check ups, the service was sslllloooowww. Our waitress even forgot to bring back our card after charging it, leaving us to hunt for her after ten minutes. Apparently it got \"too busy\" for her although there was only one other table of eight aside from us. Yikes. Best of luck on the assumably busier weekend shift.",

I got the \"Monster taco\" it came in a fried flour shell and looked pretty impressive at first glance until I realized the bottom third of the taco was pinched shut with no filling at all. I got the carnitas and the filling was basically roasted pork with almost no spice or seasoning. The rice was pretty decent, the beans were straight out of a can and they'd doctored them with cayenne pepper? They were slightly spicy and not good at all. Anyway, great atmosphere, so if that's what you're looking for you'll like it. However, if it's about the food, give this place a pass.",

I popped in some jalapeno, olives with red pepper flakes, little tiny onions, Tabasco and then... I was in a panic!! There was no bacon!! I asked the near by waitress and she apologetically said that they didn't have bacon strips to go with it. I felt a little let down, but all in all, it was still pretty darn tasty. The freshness of the other stuff made everything ok. The bacon though... that would have gotten them the fifth star ;)",

The chicken and shrimp were both super spicy as is their rice. They said everything is marinated beforehand so they can't make it differently. Another time, I tried tacos and mini chimis - both were VERY SPICY. They only give you one thing of chips and salsa and charge for chips thereafter. Also, if you sit outside, beware of smokers. I learned something new. I didn't think smoking was allowed inside or outside of restaurants but there were people smoking. As a cancer thriver I'm very careful about that. One time, we caught our server taking a vap hit from a guy.   I've been here enough times to know that it's not for me.",

The service was terrible we had to walk up to the bar to order drinks and flag down a waitress to give us menus to take our food order 45 minutes later. Lemon drop shot tasted nasty for 7.00 wasnt worth the tsp of liquor in the huge shot glass. We then tried amf's ( 8.00) while the first round was good the 2nd and  3rd were too sweet and didnt taste like the first. My friend asked if the bartender could re make her drink and the bar tender manager that was making the drinks i believe her name is miranda got rude and upset. Said shes remade the drink 3 times and that we had 30 minutes to finish what drinks we had. What she didnt know is the drinks were for individual people but didnt bother to ask. And had a bouncer of a bar come and stand by our tables and watch the clock till our time ran out to make sure we would leave. When sitting there with a group of people for 3+ hours and then asking why the drink is now tasting too sweet and not like the first ones you ordered and being asked to leave obviously your customer is never right. While we were told to take up our complaint with manager joey of the store we decided it wasnt worth our time as we will find a new place to celebrate with our family and friends on birthday occasions and take our money elsewhere. My advice for the cost of drinks and the not so awesome service go someplace else.",

We walked in and were greeted by an outdoor area where music was blaring.  There was birdpoop on the floor and benches!!! We had to ask 3 servers before one finally told us that we can sit wherever we want.  All around us people were smoking and drinking shot after shot.  And the servers were even worse!!! They were all girls walking around in practically bikinis!!! We had to ask FOUR different ladies for just a side of beans before one finally understood our request.  In the middle of our \"dinner\", we heard yelling and realized that just feet away from our table-with children-, the bartender and a bunch of customers were playing bar games!!! Completely inappropriate for a so called \"family environment\"!!!  Why have a kid menu?  With the food, we had to ask about pretty much everything because the menu was very confusing(half of the FOOD menu was a tequila menu!).  Half of my table had to order something else after finishing eating because the serving sizes are ridiculous( and the food was terrible)!!!  We all left starving with smoke in our nostrils. If you want to party at the bar, go here.  If you wan Mexican food, or have children, find somewhere else!",

It looks like it would be a fun place to hang out and have a cocktail with friends.  That is, if you can actually carry on a conversation without going hoarse because you have to yell to be heard over the blaring music.   This was our first visit to Dos Gringos.  My husband and I went out without the kids during this visit.  I saw that they had a kids menu but didn't look at prices or choices.  The food was extremely disappointing.  the chips were obviously dumped out of a bag somewhere in the back and the salsa was....bland.    I ordered a pick two combo which came with mini (very mini, three bite tacos - could have been one bite for my husband) , flautas and rice and beans.  I swear that there could not have been more than 1 Tbsp of meat in each taco and flauta.  I don't think that the flautas actually had meat in them.  I take that back, a disgusting charred bit of steak fell out of it on my last bite.  My husband ordered 2 street tacos with rice and beans.  He ended up with substantially more food at a cheaper price than mine.  His tacos looked decent, but the meat I tasted was unimpressive.   We don't plan on going back to Dos Gringos anytime in the near future.  Even the chain restaurants have them beat and that's not saying much!    My rating: Blech",

It reminded me of an ice house, but classier, with misters and food and a decent drink menu. They also play really fantastic music.. first 4 songs were all some of my favorite bands, including Passion Pit who came out of Boston, which was shocking.. and radical. Cant say Ive been to any other place that had such an impressive play list, and I am a bit of a music snob. Their nachos were enormous, and delightful, I ate every last bite, and then indulged myself in 2 more tacos after I had 3 more $2 Pacificos. Luckily for me my metabolism is amazing so I can do things like this, and I could have kept eating too because the tacos were delicious. I tried both chicken and steak, equally amazing. Our waitress was very patient, even though it was a table of 20 drunk ex co-workers of McFarlane Toys, which translates into 20 drunk super-nerds discussing comic books and video games.. She kept our drinks flowing and the food coming without missing a beat. I could tell she was overwhelmed, but nice work anyhow.. way to keep your cool. I did enjoy this place, but I am taking into account that it was Tuesday night, and really, no one else was in there.. so on a busy night this place could quite possibly suck, or be an exact replica of the Dos Gringos I used to know and had no problem forgetting.. either way, I had a good time, and I cant deny a place that has excellent music.",

The nachos were really good (make sure to add steak or chicken, both are great), and they give you a lotta guac too. The 7 layer dip was kinda dull, like they scooped out the filling of a microwaved bean and cheese burrito. Either way, all their food is pretty cheap, and during happy hour, drinks are a great deal. Also, I like the way the place is set up; most of it is outdoors/patio, so it makes for a different experience. There's also a lot of games and things to do. We saw a group of guys playing beer pong on one of the tables, and by the women's restroom there's a lobster catching game. We'd spent like 12 bucks on that game and didn't win ourselves a lobster but we got close one time, and it was pretty damn fun.",

    "text": "I am a big advocate of Dos Gringos actually but this Dos I cannot get into.  I loved the original Tempe location when it was on University, I used to go there all the time.  I love the Scottsdale location, but ever since they built this location a few years back, it's kind of like a pushover for me.  Yeah they serve the same booze, and food, and the decor is the same, but the vibe of this place isn't right.  Maybe because it's too big and they let too many riff raff's in, I really can't put my hand on it.  The only thing that really saves this place is the .50 cent coronas and well drinks on Thursday nights.  Shit I'm not even sure if they still do that anymore since it has been at least 8 months since I have been there and I don't feel as though I am missing out on anything.  I would never make plans to go here but if I was invited to go out there with a group of friends, I would just have to suck and up and go.",

    "text": "Ok. We've lived by Dos Gringos off Priest for years. It's been a long time since we've been here for drinks or for food. My husband and I have always said that we remember their food has always been pretty decent. So we got this mailer for a BOGO and it's under new ownership so we went to try it again yesterday. The place is pretty sparse at 530pm so happy hour isn't exactly rocking here (they need better drink specials I think) but that was ok with us because we were just there really for dinner and I'm totally good with a less crowded place and no kids. Anyway, service was EXCELLENT! Our server was so attentive and super sweet. Even the bar tender passed by and asked how things were and if we needed anything (we were sitting inside). Our food came out relatively fast (it was fresh!!) and it was DELISH! Didn't disappoint. We both had a wet burrito with red sauce. I had mine with carne asada and he had his with carnitas. The burritos were big in size. Very very very filling and a good portion of meat. The tortillas were nice and fresh and they were so flavorful. We were really pleased with our meals. I initially went wanting a chicken quesadilla...disappointing to see it wasn't on their menu but happy because I tried something new. So kudos to the new management. Great food and great service! We'll definitely be back and we'll bring some friends!   If you rated this anything below 4 starts maybe try it again. Hopefully you'll have the same experience we had.  Hoping the new management will make changes to their happy hour pricing to help draw a crowd.",

The bartender not even our waitress, came over and aggressively told me I couldn't eat my lunch there after I ordered a drink to compensate for not eating at their establishment. No where was it posted that you couldn't bring in outside food, so I said I was gonna just leave and not pay for the drink I had one sip of. He threatened to call the police because of that. My classmates and I went there to celebrate our last week of school and he made our whole experience so terribly uncomfortable. It could've been handled much differently but not surprised it wasn't.  Thank you, John. When I was told I couldn't bring in outside food, you did not introduce yourself as the GM or even someone that worked there- nor did you speak to me with professionalism and respect that you are now. I appreciate the response and wish you and your business the best in the future!  Best,  Bryan",

Of course there was plenty of outdoor seating since it was early. We grabbed two seats near the bar and our server appeared quickly. She was efficient and fast. Our order came out quickly (as expected since it wasn't crowded). My husband had a GIANT cheesy chimichanga and I ordered the nachos, expecting a very much smaller version. What I got was a surprise (see photo).   The nachos were pretty good and had black beans,  a light drizzle of sour cream, onions, jalapenos, olives and bits of garlic. The garlic surprised me but I was okay with it. I asked for salsa on the side and poured a bit on top which made them perfect. I ended up taking HALF of the nachos home since the portion was so big.   My only annoyance of the time there was a loud dude at the bar. Yeah, I get it...it's a bar, but gimme a break. There is such a thing as too loud at 11:30AM. Other than that, it was a pretty relaxing hour on the patio with a cold beer in my hand.",

They do have misters all throughout; however during the time I visited there were only a few on. Not sure how misters work but if all of them were spraying mist it would be a lot cooler. We also happened to be sitting under one that was leaking instead of spraying the mist so not sure how often the maintenance is done on them.   We only came for drinks, and they have different specials every day. I had a michelada with a corona, and holy guacamole it was delicious and perfectly refreshing for that afternoon. Not many can make them good so I was super impressed! After that I just had a couple Coronas and they came out ice cold which is exactly what we were craving on that hot day. Our waitress was super friendly, attentive, and smiled plenty. We did not eat so I can't say much about the food, but they had a good selection.  They also have an area to play jumbo jenga and another area for corn hole which is perfect for summer activities.",

We received them pretty quick, but they were already cold and did not look very appealing. My husband said his pork taco was ok. The chicken taco was pretty juicy but the hot sauce reminded me of something Taco Bell would sell. I was so bummed.",

I ordered crunch tacos, carnitas tacos, and tostadas. Tacos were 2 for $3 and the totadas were $6 for 2? So each taco was about $1.50 which isn't too bad. I just hated that I couldn't order just one since I love taste testing everything. If I could have I would have ordered one of each. The tacos were small, not really full of meat. Crunchy tacos were eh - definitely needed more flavor. The carnitas were BOMB, but so small! After 4 tacos, I was STILL hungry. So I ordered the tostadas. Man, those were big. Beans, meat, cheese, veggies. I ate one and I was out. I probably should have just ordered the tostadas and be done.   It was seat yourself type seating. And even though we were seated by a server, our service was still SO SLOW. No drinks, no orders taken, took forever to flag someone down for the bill. I wasn't in a hurry or anything, but its just frustrating when there is NO ONE to be found and isn't not even busy in the restaurant.

    "text": "Um, can I say that they have one of the worst bartenders ever at this joint. I can't even remember this idiot's name but he charged me for drinks that I didn't even order. When a guy goes, \"I'm buying these two ladies shots.\" it does not mean charge one of the ladies on her card that she opened a tab on 30 minutes afterward...Seriously?! And he had horrible customer service, there was barely anyone at the bar and the man acted like he was overwhelmed. There's a $5 authorization fee, why isn't this written or mentioned someplace a bit more visible, this would have totally discouraged me from opening a tab if I had seen it, yea it only sits in your account as pending, but if you're tight about your money like me, that is not cool! Hidden fees are expected from a mobile phone company, not a bar. Automatic 2 star deduction Dos Gringos, sorry!  Lesson learned, any bar night from now on at any establishment, no tabs, cash only. The upside, there was one very awesome bartender, Troy, that just about made me forget about the horrible one mentioned above. He was very nice because he turned off a fan that was freezing myself and a friend to death. And he took care of getting the drinks I didn't even order to be reversed. Thanks mang, good looking out! Great crowd otherwise and the food and drinks not too shabby. If I ever return, it will be based on some madness that I have no control over, aka my friend(s).",

    "text": "Dos Gringos is not my type of place.  I rarely drink or party or watch sports.  But I do love Mexican food and more specifically red chile burros (here in AZ).  By my own measure, I make awesome salsa.  Hot and flavorful both red and green.   The salsa at Dos Gringos was bland and tasted like a can of diced tomatoes was hastily pureed with an onion and some salt.  It was nothing special and that's sad because salsa is cheap to make.    The nachos we ordered tasted like Taco Bell's Nacho Supreme just in a bigger portion.  Even with black beans, the flavor was bland.   Okay, the upside: the weather is really beautiful right now and sitting out on the patio was really nice.  I couldn't have imagined a better way to kill an hour on Sunday.   Also, our waitress was moderately more attentive than most others.  The sign posted out front read '$4 Lunch Specials' but apparently this doesn't apply on weekends.  Why put out the sign then?  She still gave us our lunch for $4 bucks which is nice.  I don't think I'll go back unless I'm really, really bored.",

No one that evening appeared to care about service and this place was not at all busy. We had to go for some volunteer work across the street and I tried to speak to someone but they did not stop by before we had to leave so we were not late.

We took advantage of the happy hour food prices as well, and I got the quesidilla, with steak.  It was delicious and melty and cheesy, all the things it should be.  Sadly, I was so stuffed from that that I couldn't try the amazingly loaded Rocky Point Nachos or the tasty looking queso dip my friends got.    Great value, great service and a good atmosphere, this Dos Gringos is a happy hour must.",

The (free) margaritas were potent, beer was cold, chips were addictive, and the waitresses were very accommodating (and hot...that too).  They made sure we were constantly filled up, even if some people weren't tipping (bad juju!).  I didn't try the food, and I probably won't be back here unless I'm in this part of AZ again (which would be...same time next year), but if I could, I'd go back for sure.  Wish I had ordered food though, just to see how they were...

It was a little annoying that the bartender went around and changed every single tv to Monday night football (an hour before the game was starting) after my server was nice enough to put on the basketball game I wanted to watch and he came over and changed it to the Monday night football pregame (with no sound mind you and not many people in the outdoor dining area) and followed it up by saying \"you weren't watching that were you im putting on Monday night football\" well now I'm obviously not... Not a huge deal obviously but I didn't see the need for the Monday night football pregame on all 15 tvs especially since I was the only one in the vicinity of this one.

I work nights, and after punching the clock I head to Gringos for a few pick-me-ups before bowling some frames. (Expert Bowler) My wife; who drops me off and picks me up, often comes in and comments on the decor. (She really seems to like it.)   DRINKS: These guys really know their stuff here, but can I make a personal suggestion? Try the house margarita (..just wait..), splash of cranberry, splash of water, dash of bitters.(? oh yes)  Now I know what your thinking, but don't knock it till you try it. *MMMM*  I call it \"The Barnes Burner\".Most of the bartenders will know it by name. I could go for one right now. But I'll have to settle for 14 hours from now. Let the countdown begin : p  FOOD: Two words: BEEF. TACOS. not to be missed. After finishing off a plate, I get them to-go sometimes, and surprise my wife with dinner. I normally help myself to a few bites (Shh), but she never finishes them anyway,(more of a chicken fan) so theres a treat for me after throwing some great games.   Sometimes (Tuesdays?) they have open-mic comedy here, its alot of fun. If you like to laugh and have a good time (like Me) stop on in. They pull no punches up there, sometimes even picking on the audience members! Its a hoot, us regulars at the bar get in on the act and laugh too! So be prepared to be roasted! (To be safe, don't wear anything that sticks out, or they'll get cha!)Don't worry,it's all in good fun though :)   I think we all know better than to eat the chips, but otherwise this is a great place to unwind from the stress of a long night of work.

    "text": "During my five-day stay in Tempe/Phoenix, I honestly did not have a single bad meal.  Every restaurant and coffee joint I stopped at gave me great experiences.  I wanted to end my trip out to Arizona with a good dinner, and I found myself at Dos Gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west.  Honestly, the name sold me pretty quickly.  Obviously, I'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called Dos Gringos, but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man, it sounded like a good place to experience.  Despite it being chilly at night now this time of year, it was still an experience upon arrival.  It's like the tacky, somewhat tasteless, lampooned Mexican version of TGI Fridays, with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls, and a whole lot of hand-painted placards with sayings that make all of our inner-14-year-olds chuckle and appreciate.  The parking was free and plentiful, and I'm always a fan of the grungy, Christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor; my kind of style for relaxation and no-nonsense.  There were TVs everywhere, which was nice to watch some Sunday Night Football in the process, and I sat wherever I pleased.  Service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order, deliver my beer, and bring my food when it was ready.  I ordered an enchilada, and two \"street\" tacos, which were corn tortilla apparently.  Don't take my word for it, being an uneducated in Mexican food, east coaster, but I thought it was great.  Definitely different than the kind of \"Mexican\" food I can get in Atlanta.  Overall, I can't say that I had a bad experience.  The food was filling, not really expensive, and tasty to my tastebuds.  Beer, football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky Mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile, and I can't complain.  Solid, adequate way to end my dining binging throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area.",

    "text": "Has anyone noticed that almost every Mexican joint in Phoenix claims to have won some award for their tacos. Someone needs to study this disturbing trend and clearly none of those awards could possibly be related to the taco Tuesday slop they are serving up to the customers. I did notice that a comedy night was also underway when I arrived and if you are ever thinking of attending (free) don't waste your time. It is clearly amateur night as bunch of people off the street are reading their routines right off the pad in front of the crowd. Oh, a heckler could have a field day here.    The bar at this place is pretty small and full of smokers which don't add much to anything. Maybe some bar will get some balls and just ban smoking totally. Doubt it, but why the hell not?     Ok, the tacos were not too good. The tex mex ground beef was luke warm, overloaded with lettuce and a semi-stale Ortega shell. The grease factor here was very high and the meat tasted of the Jack in the box variety. The $2 chicken taco has some good shredded chicken going for it, but everything else they threw in there didn't do it much justice and made it a watery mess of sour cream, tomato juice, bagged cheese and some chicken grease. Keep it simple should be the motto. I did like the corn hole arena, but this backyard needs to be renovated. They can make better use of the space in my opinion. Nobody greets you at the entrance, so you need to hope the servers find you when you seat yourself. Not that crowded on Tuesday, but other days, it could be a long wait.",

She asked us what we wanted to drink which we said she came back with one drink when we meant for everyone as we said WE'LL start off with not I. Then she proceeded to come back and take our food order after stating are you guys gonna order food to or what. Very unprofessional as I was Hooter's girl in Peoria I would've never done that to a paying customer. On top of that all I wanted was two corn shrimp tacos and a side of beans and rice which she failed to understand resulting in my sister having to order for me? Later one she switched us to the unbecoming Erin with the resting b face. Also, chips and salsa aren't free chips are $3.00 and salsa is $1.00 which the first female told us was to compensate for the minimum wage raise. How unprofessional to let us know your being overcompensate in chips to help this dying company with their wages. Pathetic. Do yourself a favor and go to Anaya's, Garcia's, La Parilla Souza and else were.",

Only thing came out right was chips and salsa and water. If your staff doesn't know the menu of even the management, that is sad. Literally no apologies from the higher manager, waitresses talk crap behind our back and management can hear them laughing behind me. Manager said they were just talking about our situation but service so horrible just got up and left waitress said she was taking care of our tab. So then we left higher management chased us down like super not professional at all with a man, like they were going to tackle us or something. And we're two young adult females. Let say never going back there again, staff and management horrible. Never ever in my life had such horrible customer service. Do not recommend, unless you want your order to come out 3 different times wrong.",

However, I went there today, and the same bartender that helped me before said she wouldn't let me get any to go? What? So I asked to speak to a manager and the general manager came out and said he wouldn't do it. And it must have been an exception that one time. I explained it wasn't an exception, she did it no problem. He refused our order. And said \"nobody does taco Tuesday's to go\"  Really, cause I have never had anyone not allow it.   So I went down the street to Los Taquitos and ordered a ton of food to go (all taco Tuesday items), and a month and a half ago backyard taco took our order to go for taco Tuesday to go without even question! (Backyard taco has the best tacos around but are slightly farther away).  You guys just lost lots of business as our company has over 200 employees and our organization has over 2,000 locally.  The sad part is I was there years ago when the chandler Dos opened and was friends with the owner and he would never have acted that way.  Now I see why they were dead at lunch time on Taco Tuesday at this location.",

My food did not even look like tacos. I got corn tortillas which were so soggy that I couldn't even eat with fingers. The shrimp was WAY overcooked and hard, and also some pieces still had shells on them. The shredded beef tacos looked horrible. I had a nice amount of meat which was good but it wasn't even inside the tortilla, also I got a total of about 5 pieces of onion between the two of the tacos and a tiny splash of \"salsa\".

I'm see restaurants get greedy and will lose business in the long run the food was not that great. They should have a salsa bar. If you want to be disappointed and be charged for everything even the chips and salsa then this is the place. I will not return.

It wasn't busy so I was confused on why it took so long. My server spend most of the time socializing and talking to others. All in all not worth your time or your money. If you like being ignored and hungry then come on down but if not don't waste your precious time.",

    "text": "Very mediocre Mexican food, but good service.  Coming from a place called Dos Gringos, you have to expect nothing but gringo-y type food though.  I had the gringo burrito, which had a lot of meat, veggie, and black beans in it.  It also came with rice and beans.  Everything in the dish was very bland though, and I had to smother everything in Tapatio hot sauce for there to have any flavor.  Despite having some communication difficulties since it was hard to hear each other speak (We were outside on the patio at a table and a live band was playing), our waitress did a good job refilling drinks as needed and getting our orders in.  I would probably only go here again if a good band is playing here, but I wouldn't go here solely for the food.  By the way, the outdoor Jenga blocks are pretty cool.  We made a tower of 29 levels of blocks, but unfortunately did not beat the record of 34!",
