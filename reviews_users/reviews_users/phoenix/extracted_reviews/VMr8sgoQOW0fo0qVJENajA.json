The fish was very tasty, crispy on the outside and moist fish on the inside. Great sauce too!  The noodles were good. It had ground chicken with some Thai basil and being sprouts. I think next time we would try it with the rice noodles.  The Bombay curry was very good as well. We had the small portion and it was just perfect with the rest of our items including the brown rice which was a healthy portion.  It can get crowded so I would recommend making reservations. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for great Thai food.",

We have tried a few other places around and nothing compares to here. Its always fresh and always delicious. We started off with one of their specials - it was a crab and shrimp cake wrapped in rice paper or something to make it crunchy and flash fried. It was served like a lettuce wrap with some picked daikon and carrot with some cucumber as well. It had a nice spicy sweet sauce as a topper and we both loved this dish and I would have gotten this as my actual meal had I known how big it would be.  I had the basil chicken served with white rice and boyfriend had the drunken dragon noodles. My chicken was nice and tender with a flash fried outside - not like deep fried or gross- I actually felt good eating this. Boyfriends noodles were nice and spicy and the basil was delicious in his dish.  We were too full for desert but had a great date night with great food and some wine and beer.",

    "text": "We have been to Malee's several times. The food is consistent each time we go. The happy hour has very good prices on wine, beer and appetizers, so perhaps this is a good way to try a few of their dishes first and then you can decide to come back! We found ourselves enjoying any of their fish dishes.  We like chicken and other meats, but feel the preparation of fish at Malee's represent the better items on their menu.   We always get a bowl of the Tom Ka Gai soup.  It is $6.25 a bowl which is a relatively high price for the size of the bowl, but worth every penny. The Warm Glass Noodle Salad was a bit of a disappointment this time.  There were only four shrimp in the entire salad and they were very overcooked.   The last item we had was the Crispy Mango Fish.  It was a wonderful white fish with a semi-sweet sauce with mango which was perfect.  If you like heavy batter on your fish, then stick with the other dishes on the menu.  The batter at Malee's is very light and crispy.",

Each time I step out for some fresh air, my mouth starts to water--the aromas that drift up from Malee's always make me second guess returning to class.   This evening, equipped with a growling stomach and some brutal seasonal allergies, I made it a point to arrive an hour before class and finally give this place a go. I must have appeared lost as I walked up towards the back of the restaurant because one of the employees, Daniel, on his break and in the middle of a conversation, quickly asked if he could help me find something. When I told him I was looking for the entrance, he was kind enough to end his call, introduce himself, and escort me inside to a lady, Angel, who seemed delighted to seat me (customer service at its best!).   The decor was classy, modern. And the view I had of the patio as the sun set was spectacular. I ordered a beer, the Tom Ka Gai Soup and the Drunken Dragon Noodles, Thai hot (a level of heat that brought a couple beads of sweat to my brow). All were excellent, but I was in heaven when I tried their Tom Ka Gai soup (as though it weren't already a challenge to return to class).   I've frequented Thai restaurants all over Phoenix and I've found that good Thai food is hard to come by; excellent Thai food is downright rare; but excellent Thai food coupled with phenomenal customer service from every server and staff member who walked past my table--well, let's just say I won't let the hour-long commute into Scottsdale deter me from many more future visits to Malee's!",

Well, we arrived at about 6:15 or so and were seated right as we arrived and we kind of already knew what we wanted (or at least I did). We started with a pot of Tom Ka Gai and as always it was outstanding and had enough to take home (SCORE). I ordered the Coco Chili Fish and my boyfriend ordered the Crispy Teriyaki Chicken. We also had brown rice as well. My dish was cooked perfectly. The dish is so filling so I had two more meals for leftovers and my boyfriend liked his but it wasn't his favorite. The chicken was a tad tough for him but still really good. Service was great and food was delicious. I cannot wait to go back (hopefully sooner than later).",

If you are looking for something more exciting, try the Tom Ka Gai soup, Crispy Basil Chicken or Coco Chili Fish.  And for the record, ask for your server to be Cassie. She's been there a while and knows the menu like the back of her hand. Fabulous service.  The bar makes a pretty mean cocktail, too. And you can order take-out! Thai on the Fly!",

Based on my experience it took a few times to find the right heat for me. First visit Level 2 (Jalapeno Fried Rice) yum, come on, give me a little burn on the tongue. Second visit Level 5 (Jalapeno Fried Rice) holy shit, fill the bathtub with ice, sweat dripping down the face as well as going in and out of consciousness lvl 5 is beyond a kick to the face. Third visit, a little scared, went down to Level 3, (Jalapeno Rice, Chicken Curry) yum, a little burn, but not enough for this Irish lad. The great thing about this place is that you will find the food loaded with flavor and going there multiple times to find your heat level is a great excuse to get back here. The Chicken Curry sauce is beyond delicious. One of those sauces that you could eat as a soup! Jalapeno Rice (House Specialty) is my go to as you can see. Loaded with spicy sausage, Thai basil, egg and peppers,  this fried rice is by far the best I have ever had. A great meal in itself. Little FYI get the Fried Tofu app. Amazing with the special peanut sauce.",

It was so busy that they didn't even seat us with reservations until 8:15, really?? So once seated, service was super slow, tap water, really? Yuck!! Ordered the Thai pad, it was mushy and so tasteless. One of my friends ordered their fish and he said it was tasteless and another had their teriyaki chicken and thought it was tasty. Atmosphere, too many ppl cramped in, this will be one place I will avoid next time in town. I was a little surprised that they didn't offer us a free appetizer for not getting us in exactly at reserved time.",

For my drink, I ordered a Painkiller, which was delicious and went down way too easy.  The blend of light and dark rum was perfect.  (Needless to say, I ended up ordering a second.)  We ordered the Touch of Thai appetizer so that we could try out several different things.  The best thing was the Chicken Satay, and a close second was the Crab Rangoons.  The plate came with a slew of dipping sauces, which were all explained in great detail by our server.  (The entire staff was very attentive... one of the best experiences I've ever had!)  For my meal, I ordered the Shrimp in a Clay Pot (a seasonal dish), which came with glass noodles.  It was very good, but I think next time, I'll try something a bit more flavorful.  My boyfriend got the Drunken Dragon Noodles and loved them!  I like the fact that their menu offers \"small plates\" of several dishes, which is nice when you want to have an appetizer along with your main dish.  Overall, Malee's is a great (not cheap, but not too pricey) Thai place in Old Town Scottsdale!",

He even had a dish made that was not on the menu.   Try the Jalapeno fried rice, pad thai,and special fried fish. The fish is fried with a tast coconut spicy chili sauce.  The chicken dish that is fried and then a dark garlicky sauce on top is sublime.  Coconut shrimp appetizer and tom yum soup was a hit with the group as well.  They have a thai beer in a large bottle that is pretty good.    As for spice level we had mild to hot at our table based on the spice level that we asked for.  The waiter did not miss a beat and we were so glad we went to this place.",

Their \"Taste of Thai\" appetizer is a good place to start. They will make if for as many people as you want. Their soups are amazing too! They also offer cooking classes. In the summer time they offer a gift certificate, spend $60 and get $100 worth. I think they also have one where you spend $30 and get $50 worth.  YOU MUST GO HERE IF YOU LIKE THAI FOOD.",

Recently we've come to know very well 2 servers: Chana and Bo. They provide exceptional customer service! Chana even knows what we want even before we sit down! They're both very accommodating (giving us extra rice because they know our appetites), and our drinks are always filled.   I love that they offer cooking classes on their menu items. We haven't tried it yet...maybe for the fact that we'd rather go to Malee's than cook it at home! Lol   They offer a sophisticated, simple, casual ambience...that makes for a wonderful dining experience! We've been here with large parties as well, and the experience is still on point. Bravo to Malee's and everything you have to offer!",

Unfortunately, my meal was lackluster. I dined at the bar, since I was traveling solo. I ordered the crab rangoons and the basil chicken entree. The rangoons were very small and not well seasoned. I had to drown them in sauce to add flavor to the thin understuffed appetizer. When my entree arrived, it resembled a bunch of chicken tenders drowned in tamarind sauce. According to the menu, this dish is a staff favorite. Can't say the same for me...it was edible but not great. Oh well, you win some you lose some.",

What's lacking is the taste of the food. We skipped the lunch menu and ordered off the regular menu and shared the dishes. We ordered the Coco Chili Fish (flash fried 10 oz. Filet drizzled with a creamy coconut chili reduction sauce, for a collision of sweet and spicy) and the Lettuce Wraps of Minced Pork (Nam Sod) (a blend of minced pork, ginger, red onion, cilantro and ground peanuts tossed in a citrus marinade) and a bowl of Tom Ka Gai Soup (hot & sour soup made with chicken, mushrooms, fresh lemon grass, galanga root, kefir lime leaf & coconut milk. Garnished with fresh cilantro & green onion)  The Soup was not light in taste, very tomato like, thick, though it had a lot of chicken it was like tomato soup, not authentic at all. The fish, though perfectly done and tasted fresh was totally over shadowed by a thick goopy sauce covering the entire dish. There was no hint of sweet and again that thick tomato sauce. The Pork Lettuce wraps were descent probably because it didn't have that thick red tomato sauce piled on. We were very disappointed.  Sorry if you want authentic Thai there are many other choices.",

Located in the arts district of Old Town, this is an unassuming spot.  not a whoel in the wall at all, but not overly stuff.     They can alter the heat level to your taste (traditional real Thai is HOT).  I've had everything fromt he Tom ka Ga soup, to the amazing fish dish and the curry.  Everything I've had touches upon the basics of Thai cooking: the heat, the sweet, the savory.  Everything is flavorful, reasonably priced, and fresh.",

    "text": "We had a terrific lunch on a Wednesday. We walked in about 12:30 pm and the place was jumping. Only one table empty and they were a little bit in the weeds so it took a little while to get our server to come back and take our order. He apologized for the slower than normal service, luckily we were not in any kind of hurry and we didn't mind.  My better half ordered the lunch special jalapeno fried rice with added Chinese sausage and the soup of the day which was chicken cucumber. To keep it on the lighter side I ordered the Drunken Dragon wraps.  The server was right on the money regarding the level of heat on a 1 to 5 scale. We told him we liked it hot and he said a 3 will make your head sweat. He was right, it was the perfect amount of heat.  The chicken cucumber soup had a flavor that I can't really describe, it tasted very authentic, was very light and probably had some fish sauce. It was a small cup for the lunch special and had two or three large chunks of chicken and about eight or 10 small chunks of cucumber in the broth. The soup came out piping hot - scalding actually, you're not going to get sick from lukewarm soup at this place!  The jalapeno fried rice with the Chinese sausage was perfectly balanced. The rice was tender, the jalapeno was not overpowering in terms of the number of pieces or heat level, and the Chinese sausage slices were well charred and defatted so that it did not have that cold salami type of texture - they were actually crispy and browned nicely.  The Drunken Dragon Wraps was a welcome change from the usual Larb flavor profile which for me usually has too much lime and not enough other flavor. The chicken was tender and paired well with the very mild amount of curry and small amount of coconut milk added to it. Some cilantro and peanut garnishes which were served on the side or a nice touch.  Next time we are in town we will definitely return!",

The food was very good, offering to personalize your choice of heat options.   We started with some fried Spring Rolls - A Thai vegetarian classic. Flash-fried Asian crepe rolls filled with egg, celery, carrot, glass noodles and Thai spices. Served with malee's own house sweet and sour sauce. I then ordered their Yellow Curry Chicken, the mildest of the curries. Coconut cream, carrots, onions, bell peppers and potatoes and their Drunken Dragon Noodles ( Pad Key Mao)Thai wives revenge on drunk husbands. Rice noodles and minced chicken, tossed with fresh Thai basil and bean sprouts in a light green curry saute.  Didn't get any pics this time, but I will be going back again...so I'll add them later!",

When we showed up the place was decently busy, but not so busy that they had no open tables, yet we were left standing awkwardly at the reception area while 4 people walked by trying not to make eye contact. I understand your servers are busy, but if you have a group of people up front, it's best not to let them stand ungreeted for minutes on end without acknowledging them.   2. When we were seated the busser delivers glasses and plates, one of which clearly still has a couple inches of smeared curry on it. When pointed out, he reached over and wiped at it with his finger thinking that would be enough. No, sorry, that's not ok. I found it odd that he seemed annoyed  when asked to get a clean plate.   3. We waited for ten minutes for anyone else to come take drink orders at the very least. None came, we waited five more minutes. Still nothing, so we left.   That was the end of our adventure.",

The Pandan with black sticky rice, rice was way undercooked not even edible.  On top of bad quality food, our order was incomplete with missing items upon arriving home.  Called the restaurant n the manager by the name of Karen came on the phone, speaking in a very sarcastic n condescending tone rather than apologizing for the incomplete order as if it was a crime to report our incomplete take-out order.

The fish was fried OK, but that's not rocket science.  The lines and crowds were outlandish for the quality and style of food.   Lao Thai on Scottsdale Road is a MUCH better choice for Thai food.

Neither disappointed; both delighted.  The soup's broth was delicate but tasty, and the fish bounty was so abundant we needed \"take-home\" boxes.  Not to be out done, the second entree's combo of curry and coconut, while traditional, was virtuoso.  The service was as good as the food -- exemplary (sorry about the other reviewer's bad experience).  Our waitress, Oi, was so energetic, friendly and informative that we felt as if we were dining at the home of a good friend.  Great service can go a long way masking mediocre food.  In this case, the service complemented!   Malee's is wonderful without having to be overly cute.  My advice -- run, don't walk when you next  hunger for Thai cusine.",

My aunt and I had a hour to spare before the Art Walk started so we decided to try this place.   Thai Ice Tea (5 stars) - Its my go to beverage choice at any Thai restaurant. This one was perfect. The milk and tea was balanced and wasn't excessively sweet like others.   Crispy Basil Chicken (4 stars) - It was very tasty with good spiced flavor. It had a lightly crisp texture on the outside. This entree came with rice and, and we chose brown rice (3 stars).   Pad Thai (5 stars) - This is one of the best Pad Thais I've ever had.  It was flavorful, and every bit was scrumptious with shrimp and a generous amount of chicken.  You can choose the spicy level for all dishes. I chose medium, and it packed a satisfying kick. I don't think I would be brave enough to try very spicy.   Thai Tea Mousse with Raspberry and White Chocolate (3 stars) - Unfortunately, there was no Thai tea flavor. It was was raspberry mouse with some white chocolate chips. I was disappointed.   Service (3 stars) - The staff was nice, but our server just did not know the dishes very well. It's my dining pet peeve when a server does not know the menu. My aunt and I asked for suggestions like if we should choose between a small or full portions. His answers were not helpful. 4 stars for the rest of the staff and 2 stars for our server = 3 star average.   It's a great place to dine especially on Thursdays before the Art Walk since it's surrounded by the art galleries.",

I heard the grief all the way there. \"Come on honey, it's an adventure!\".   We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious!   I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special \"gluten free\" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!  The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)",

I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!",

So we started searching for a Thai restaurant and Malee's Thai came up.  It was close to our hotel as I discovered, the owner is an American woman.  I was so excited to find out how she did it.  Upon entering the restaurant, it took awhile for the hosts to come out and seat us.  The restaurant has nice simple decor, casual elegant more than most Thai restaurant.  About the food:  We order dumplings, soft shell crab, and crab Rangoon.  I thought the dipping sauce was very good.  My husband thought it was so-so.  I order crispy chicken with garlic and basil , with steamed rice.  The sauce in chicken was very unique.  I liked it.    I would put her restaurant into Asian Fusion category.  Much, much better  than PF Chang!!  Overall Malee's Thai was a pleasant dining experience.  We will come back if we are in the area and try some other dishes.",

We went on a Thursday and came back for take-out the following night.  Even the take out was AWESOME, they didn't miss a beat and everything was perfect.    We ordered the following, in order of our favorites:  Burma Gai Tropical Pineapple Thai Basil Margarita (tasty) Drunken Dragon wraps (a little bit salty) Malee's Roasted Duck Spicy Cashew Beer (tasted like it was a crocpot meal)  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright.   We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-2 were super spicy and other's 4-5 weren't that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest)   Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot.",

But then another woman came over and she was funny and kind and great (and successful) at upselling, and she really made the experience so much better. She brought over extra rice when we asked for it, and also when I got a box for my leftovers, she added a small carton of rice to go with it, which was very thoughtful.   Food: we got calamari to share, and it was served with two sauces. I only used the sweet chili one, and it was delicious with the calamari. Nothing special, but solid. I got the \"Tropical Pineapple,\" which was just a seafood curry served in a pineapple. It wasn't spicy AT ALL despite me ordering it \"hot,\" but still exceptionally delicious. There was only one shrimp, which was kind of disappointing, because shrimp is my favorite seafood, but there was a lot of calamari and a good number of scallops and mussels. My s/o got the yellow curry, which he scarfed down.  Drinks: Originally, I wasn't going to drink anything at all. But then our server mentioned sangria, and I couldn't help myself. It was strong, but very fruity.   I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Scottsdale and craving some Thai.",

They definitely dial the spice back for a western palate, so if you like things spicy make sure you ask for that. I ordered green curry, medium, tonight and received what I would call ultra mild. Even with that though, the flavor was excellent. We will be back repeatedly. Also, the value for quality and portion is through the roof!",

    "text": "First off, my mom and I liked that there was an outdoor seating area. Our server was pretty attentive and apologized to us that our food was taking so long and let us know that it would be out shortly (which held True). We ordered the Arizona Heatwave Curry and Pad thai. The curry was pretty good, but it wasn't anything special. The pad Thai though, I was actually pleasantly surprised. It's not your traditional pad Thai (the sauce is quite different), but it's very good and comes with chicken AND shrimp. It's not a pad Thai I would order every time though, just because it's not very authentic.   A plus about this place is they said they didn't cook with any MSG. I called about 8 other Thai restaurants in the area and they all cooked with it, so it was relieving to find this place (my mom gets migraines from MSG).  Now for the reason for the bad rating. We took home leftovers, and it wasn't until the next day that we found what looked to be half of a clothespin in the curry. Stumped and disgusted, my mom emailed the restaurant with pictures.  Their response was: \"We do use color coded clothes pins to decipher spice levels when food comes up in the window.  We clip them on the side of the plates.  This one must have broke and went into your Heatwave Curry.\" They offered to reimburse us for the food. I realize this isn't the most disgusting thing to discover in your food, but things like that should never end up in a food dish. It could have really hurt someone if the metal part had fallen in there too. This was enough for me to not want to come back.",

Here's why...  We were able to be seated late on a Friday night.  We got seated at about 9:15 or 9:30 and they were super accommodating.    When I ordered my dish Thai Hot, I also explained I really meant Thai Hot.  The waiter Chana explained to me that they have one level hotter, which is CHEF HOT.  He then told me that I probably did not want it that hot because the chef is crazy.  I agreed to Thai Hot and asked for some extra thai chilies.  When my dish came, the Spicy Cashew Beef, I was immediately satisfied with the heat level.  Still, I added more chilies to it.  Yeah, I am crazy.  It was DELICIOUS.  I ordered the small size, which was only $9.99, and I had about 50% left over even with my friends eating some of it for me.    The appetizers were really interesting looking and I cannot remember what they were called.  The guys loved them, but I didn't try them.  I know that is not super helpful, but I will post a picture.  I don't see the description of them on the menu.  They looked like little tornadoes of chow mein that covered a chicken/shrimp gyro inside.  I dunno how else to explain them!  Interesting stuff.  The bathrooms were clean and there was mouthwash in the bathroom with little disposable cups to use.  Still, the thought crossed my mind that someone could spike the mouthwash.  Yeah, I am paranoid.  Ha ha.  The service was great.  We never lacked for water refills.  I forgot to use my check in offer, but I'm not worried since I will be back!",

Even though it was a Friday night, we got seated right away (without a reservation). It was the perfect night to sit outside so and we were happy to be sat on their patio.   We were very pleased with our appetizers and main dishes. My favorite part of the meal was the crab rangoons. They're filled with flavor, crunchy, and the plum dipping sauce is divine. The crab-shrimp rolls my husband got were OK. His favorite part of the meal was the half pineapple that his main dish was served in (see pic.)! My Thai basil chicken was yummy and a three spice level was spot on, but it needed more sauce and was dry. Also, we were not initially given enough rice and had to ask for more. Last but not least, I enjoyed a frozen Thai basil margarita that was not overly sweet and very refreshing. My husband enjoyed their Thai beer which was light and smooth.   Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner and look forward to the next time. This was a great way to end a long week!",

Our server guy was friendly, quick and did a great job of attending to our large party.  The ambiance was more relaxed (and less pretentious) than I had expected (considering you're in Old Town Scottsdale), so I appreciated that.  Parking was easy.. not sure how we lucked out on great parking spots on a Sat night in the area, but we did!  The food: My sister's coconut fish was very tasty.. addictive probably because of the creamy coconut milk and the sugar they obviously added.. still delicious. My pork lettuce wraps were tasty and I had the option of getting them with red/purple leaf cabbage, which was a nice change.  The meat was savory and seasoned well and my portion was so big, there was no finishing it. My bro's seafood curry was a hefty portion (as were all the rest of the dishes in our party) but I wasn't a big fan of the flavor. My hubby's spare ribs were overly-flavored (yes, that does exist) and I didn't enjoy the bite I had.  Im not sure how authentic this Thai food is, but it was tasty... Thai food is quite healthy (yes, I do believe coconut fats are healthy), but all the sugar added for flavor enhancement of the currys is not very Thai.. nor appealing to me.  For a once-in-a-while occasion, I'd go.. but it's not really on my \"must go back\" list, sadly.",

I got the Thai fire wraps and really liked it. It does not appear I can respond to the owner's comment, but I just read it. My mom specifically complained to our waitress that the rice was cold and she had needed a refill of her iced tea since a few minutes from us getting the food. My water was empty and I was eating something very hot, even the water does not help that, I still wanted a refill. I proceeded to get up to the bar about 15 minutes later and the bartender refilled my water. When my mom complained to the waitress about the service she acted as though she was confused and almost began marking her, repeating everything she was saying. So I got a little bit angry and told her we were unhappy with the service. She said she would do something about it, but unfortunately did not. The birthday dessert, creme brulee was very good.",

    "text": "This has to be the most we've ever paid for Thai that wasn't authentic, nor good.  As a San Diegan, I'm spoiled with all the Thai restaurants we have. It's easy to get great, hole-in-the-wall Thai food that tastes amazing. Although I looked at the Yelp page before visiting, I didn't think about the fact that maybe Arizona folks don't know what authentic Thai food tastes like. Besides the fact that much of the usual noodle and curry dishes are just scratching the surface, even these 'basic' dishes had the entirely wrong taste profiles and seemed prepped in the wrong way.   On that note - of prepping the food in the wrong way - we're pretty sure that the chicken in my dish and the beef in my boyfriend's dish were both cooked ahead of time and then overcooked with the ingredients of the dishes. The meat was bland. I bet if I were to peek into the kitchen, we'd see pre-cooked proteins sitting and waiting to be tossed into the noodle or curry dishes.  My boyfriend's pad see ew was kind of dry. It was a big portion, but just didn't pack the taste we're used to with pad see ew anywhere else. He asked for a 2, which out of a 5 should've been a little spicier than it was.   My pad Thai had chicken, shrimp, and tofu. The chicken was overcooked, though I liked the shrimp and the tofu. The taste was very off; I couldn't figure out what they must have put in the sauce to make it taste the way it did. It tasted closer to tomato sauce with fish sauce than anything else. I ventured the guess that maybe they're just using packets from a non-Asian store, and my boyfriend thought maybe I could be right.  However, I'm giving the place 2 stars because the service was good, the drink list was varied, and the atmosphere was nice. The gal at the front was nice and I could tell that the employees care about giving their customers a good experience. But it just wasn't authentic, and we were really bummed to pay $15 per dish - easily $4-6 more expensive per dish than a more authentic place - plus drinks for something that so badly missed the mark.",

Good eats with good folks definitely hit up this place if you are in the area and are craving Thai.  my recommendation is if you are bringing a date and want things slightly slower paced ask to be seated in the room with live performance one man show playing oldies on his guitar, all slow paced music, if remember correctly alot of it was spanish love ballads  we asked to be moved cause we did not want to be rude and laugh the entertainer.  Here is what we sampled, mind you we had 5 people with us so we may have ordered a bit much  Exotic Fried Rice - lite, flavorful, well paired ingredients went well with everything we ordered  Burma Gai - standard, not spicy, curry not to runny, perfect to pair with the fried rice  Coco Chili Fish - a bit of a kick but delicious bite on every bite, small breaded pieces of fish with coconut chili, didn't know coconut could be spicy  Crispy Basil Chicken - flash fried chicken with more of that spicy chilli, definite must try  Drunken Dragon Noodles - we had to try it cause it had dragon in it hahaha, spicy heavy, mix of thai basil, bean sprouts, and green sauce, lips were burning but it would sample it again  thai hot wings - slight crunch, piping hot, salty sweet wings got to have more  calamari - standard crunch, chewy center, lightly season   I know we ordered more but these are the dishes I recall, on a whole surprised the Arizona got a place that serves Thai food that is this good, definite will be back if I am in Arizona.  food ***** surprised and awed service ****  price $$ ambiance **** I would stay away from the section where they have a live performer, stick with the section that has no live entertainment, only recommendation if is you bring a date stay in the section of the entertainer, he was singing spanish love ballads from what I recall hearing",

A lovely lady, I don't know who she was, immediately came over to wish me a happy birthday! And she highly recommended the house soup. We ordered three different appetizers to share and forgot to order the soup! However, we remembered and got it before our entrees! We ordered the Crispy Basil Chicken, the Mango Fish and the regular fried rice with a seafood mix. The appetizers were good, but not special, however the soup was sensational! My taste buds were dancing! The fried rice dish was for our companion who doesn't particularly like Thai food, but he cleaned his plate!  We couldn't decide whether the chicken or fish was best. Both get rave reviews from me. Service was very good,  and the night I was there, there was a mix of ages, from 20 to 70's. and the best thing that I can say is we're going back tonight before I fly home!",

The pad thai was a pile of dry, sticky noodles with no flavor whatsoever.   The spring rolls were absolutely delicious. Some of the best I've had.   The entire meal cost $48. You'd pay only $28 at any other thai restaurant. If I had paid $18 it would've been too much.   I live right next door and won't be returning any time soon. Try the place in Thomas just west of Scottsdale Rd. Much better.  I'll give bonus points to the staff. They were all great. Everyone was so genuinely happy and nice.

To start: Siamese Kisses - I would consider these a thai version of shu mai with chicken instead of the traditional pork.  Six small dumplings stuffed with chicken and shrimp are paired with a chili paste and a soy sauce with green onion.  Very good appetizer for sharing!  Entrees: Chicken Panang Curry - Probably my favorite on the menu.  It's loaded with flavor and spice and has plenty of chicken in it!  Put that over some rice and I'm in heaven.  Drunken Dragon Noodles - I want to love it, but it just seems like another version of phad thai.  They consider it to be phad  kee mao, but I've never had phad kee mao with phad thai noodles.  I love it with the wide noodles.  I also thought the sauce should've been a little sweeter and there were way too many bean sprouts.  Flavors were decent, but I'll try something else next time.  Dessert: Mango and Sticky Rice - This stuff is so addicting with the condensed milk on top!  The service is outstanding and I love the atmosphere (even if it isn't very traditional Thai decor) and especially enjoy sitting on the patio if it's not too hot out.",

The pla aka, jungle princess and panang chicken curry are a few of our favorites but, to be fair, everything I've tasted has been as good or better than any other Thai spot we've been to and we've been to many. As a matter of fact, we're having dinner with friends on the patio at Malee's tonight. Start your dinner with the Tom Ka soup in the burning dish and finish it off with the coconut ice cream, you won't be sorry. Say what you want but when we are ready for Thai, Malee's is our destination more often than not.",

I would like to add that I also ordered the take-out and waited so that the fish would be very crisp. Initially the young man took my name on a piece of scrap paper which he said they would keep along the wall for the next time I came in.  I told him I was only in town every few weeks. Although he offered me a gift certificate, I declined. I truthfully didn't see the point of taking that as I don't plan on returning.  I was calm, but told him I was disappointed. I don't feel the handling of my complaint was at all satisfactory, especially since the owner was standing 15 feet away....a simple refund would have been in order for that one dish, and would have left me considering giving Malee's and their pla a 4th chance...",

Being in love with the Chicken Panang, it is the only dish I have ordered, but I have had bites of the Drunken Dragon Noodles, Crispy Basil Chicken, and Tamarind Chicken, and they are all exceptional - especially when made Very Hot or Thai Hot.  Service has always been efficient and friendly and the atmosphere is nice.  If I lived closer I would visit more often, but the trek to Scottsdale and the higher-than-average price make it easy for me to save Malee's for a monthly trip.  If you haven't been yet, you should.  Your mouth will thank me!",

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in the metro Phoenix area, a spot that has been operating for nearly three decades, and a friendly neighborhood bar where I love to take new faces.  I rarely sit in the dining area of the restaurant.  The tables that crowd the tiny space make the environment seem too cramped, and an intimate night out might be shared with the couple at the table next to you. Sit at the bar, where you are always waited on promptly, the bar tenders are quite knowledgeable, have time to discuss the art of being alive, and can whip up some delectable treats before you receive your fare.  My personal favorite beverage is the Thai Iced Tea.  Though non-alcohlic, it is delicious and complements any of the foods well. Ask the bartenders or servers about the wine list, often they carry imported beer from Italy as well. I will start by saying I have not tasted everything on the menu,  but i do know what i will order again and again.  If you are new to Thai food, an absolute must is the \"Tom Ka Gai\" soup.  A serving ideal for a party of three, it is a divine hot and sour interpretation with coconut milk, mushrooms, cilantro, lemongrass, galangal root, and kaffir lime.  It can be ordered with any meats, tofu, or just plain.  I recommend it with all white chicken, and at a number 2.  If you are unsure about how spicy you want your Thai food, remember that 1 is not spicy, and 5 (the highest) will probably burn offyour taste buds.  Perhaps you like spicy, but also note that too much spice will overpower the complexity of your foods. If you want an assortment of various appetizers, try the Combination plate which includes Spring rolls, Satay, (marinated chicken tenders with cucumber and peanut sauces, and my favorite!) Thai Toast, (flash fried toast points filled with garlic and chicken, not my favorite) Crab Rangoon, (delicious flash-fried puffs of crab and cream cheese served with thai sauces) Siamese Kisses,  (chicken and shrimp in steamed shumai wraps topped with scallions and crispy garlic) and Potstickers.   All come with an assortment of sauces, and if your eyes are larger than your belly, then you will likely have no room left for the divine main courses. Quite frankly, I have never tried any of the house favorites, except the Pad Thai.  And if Pad Thai is all you know, I recommend you venture out this time and wrap your lips around some of the sweetest, most delicious curries this side of the West I am not a fan of vegetables, which is something one finds an overabundance of in Thai dishes...but not if you order the \"Burma Gai.\"  Flat noodles and chicken in a yellow curry with coconut milk with titillate and tantalize.  You can substitute, add, or remove anything in any one of the entrees, so you can basically customize your entrees. If you like something with a little more pizazz, do the \"Drunken Dragon Noodles\" or \"The Evil Jungle Princess.\"  Another curry dish, the Dragon, has rice noodles smothered with a wild green curry sauce, topped with chicken, basil, and onion. Again, if you are not a fan of the spicy, go very easy on this one.  Better yet is the Princess, which has a lovely coconut sauce with hints of mint, and two simple additions of chicken and straw mushrooms.  Though I prefer chicken or nothing at all, the Green Basil Curry with Pork is another incredible curry with coconut and various veggies. You will also have a selection of seafood dishes, as well as specialty sushi rolls and vegetarian preparations.  Remember that the sauces here are the key, all dishes are served with rice, all ingredients can be removed or substituted, and if you really want to taste the diverse flavors, don't make your dish too spicy. Don't be shy to ask, as all the waitstaff here is very knowledgable, and even if you are new to Thai, or a veteran, they can assist you in making the perfect choice. Should you have room for dessert at the end of your robust meal, a must is the traditional Thai favorite, Sticky Coconut Rice with fresh mangos. Not heavy enough to warrant a wheelbarrow for the ride home, but sticky and sweet enough to make you feel like a kid again. In short, I love this place!  And I have to come here at least once a month just for the soup and the great conversation with the bartenders.",

Their food is delicious, they use high quality ingredients, and they give you your money's worth! Some plates can be made into \"half orders\" which are still huge (I can't finish them even sometimes) and even the regular sized portions are well priced. The atmosphere is nice, as it is located in Old Town Scottsdale which is a cute little area and a nice place to have a meal. I reccomend the Drunken Dragon Noodles (for you spicy lovers!) or the Panang Chicken. Spinach Chicken is also delicious.",

Maybe it's me but I did not taste any crab what so ever, just some deep fried something with something mushy inside, probably the cream cheese.   We had a seafood type entree which was OK (Thai Basil type). No worth the premium but OK. We also had the curry duck, which was plain disgusting. I had a couple of bites and that was it. For sure the worst duck I ever had. Must have been dead for a long, long time.  With the foul taste in my mouth, we passed on the desert.   Quite a disappointment.",

    "text": "I guess Malee's has been around 25 years, but it seems like fifty, and I mean that in a good way.  The restaurant is both venerable and hip enough to comfortably pass as Scottsdale \"special occasion\" - without breaking the bank.    Is it as uniformly \"special\" as the finest resort dining room. No. Nobody here is going to fold your napkin into a swan and there's no focal Dale Chihuly wine rack or glorious mountain view. But if you play it smart, a memorable and exotic meal can be had in a charming locale.    Here's my advice, lemongrasshopper:     Make a dinner reservation. Table location and service are better when you do.  True most places, but moreso here .    Get the pot of soup.  Tom Ka Gai is a warming, communal ritual and helps smooth over slow Fri & Sat nite service.    Solicit server recommendations. Most of the menu resonates and Malee's tailors spice level to individual tastes well, but some dishes are consistently better than others.    Do all that, and I'm pretty sure you'll have a nice experience. Walk in cold, take a blind stab at the menu, and you're apt to be less impressed.   I like the atmosphere, especially in the main dining room. It's an older building, with low ceilings and residential style rooms. Dimly lit, but not clubby and masculine like Don & Charlies. An unseen piano gently tinkles in the background.  Older couples, younger out of towners, packs of gay foodies, the occasional family celebrating a birthday.  A pleasant, bustling mix.    There are art galleries and holiday lights on Main Street (which is more of a  quiet side street at night) and plenty of parking at dinner time.  Fine choice for a date or before a show,when you're trying to impress someone special with your inscrutable melange of bold yet traditional values - rather than simply with your wallet.",

I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I can't imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, I'm more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear it's typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.

I was surprised to see that they offered creme Brule on the dessert menu. This is my all time favorite dessert and I order whenever possible. This one had ginger on bottom, one of the best creme Brule's I have had, it was the  perfect texture, consistency and sweetness.

The class itself was very informative, and really opened my eyes to the huge selection of vegetarian options at Malee's.  Most importantly they gave me information on how to cook my own Thai vegetarian cuisine, and the best places in town to find the ingredients. During the class they take you through about 5 recipes, and then provide sampling for the dishes as you go.   After the class you sit down for a full meal of the items presented in the class, along with wine pairing.  It was such a great experience, because I was able to try several dishes at once.  Most of these dishes I would probably never order, because I would assume they were not vegetarian. I was particularly taken back by the peanut curry, it was amazing!  If you dine at Malee's, keep in mind that just about everything on the menu can be made gluten free or vegetarian, just ask.  Finally, I would highly recommend the cooking class, you leave with a good understanding of the basics of Thai cooking, a goodie bag, and a full stomach!",

But it seems that the menu went from the classics of Thai cuisine to some strange American-Asian fusion which was trying harder to be \"stir fry with Thai influence\" rather than straight up Thai.  So we stopped going and eventually, through no fault of our own, the restaurant closed.  We went to Malees down on Main in Old Scottsdale and I had very high hopes.    The soup was good, great flavors, all the right ingredients.  However, for the main courses, again, what in the hell is up with the menu?  I kept looking for the Thai classics, but they were really either hidden or nowhere to be found.  Panang, a bit, Mussamon was shockingly absent, but lots of 'fusion-style\" dishes and largely pedestrian fare was abundant.  This is darned near like going to an Indian restaurant and having no aloo mater, tandoori dishes or naan.  If you're looking for a semi-elegant place to bring out of town guests that say they're adventurous eaters but probably aren't, you may find this as an acceptable choice.    If you're a True fan of the Thai classics, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  The service is good, a little rushed and the owner seems to care about the restaurant, but I really won't be returning until Deidre brings back the Thai classics.  I don't want a simple, universally-accessible menu.    I want to go on a culinary adventure.  Bring back the adventure and I'll bring you my dining dollars.",

Only complaint is that there often isn't enough room left for more beer.",

I've come here on my last three visits to Scottsdale and, I'm contemplating going here again this evening lol.  They can serve up the heat too. The have mild, medium and hot and, \"Thai\" hot - I love it.  I order the \"that\" hot but this is NOT for the light hearted.  It'll make you eyelids sweat - that's hot.  :)  I highly recommend this place - don't miss this place if you truly enjoy good Thai food.",

Spring rolls: tough rice paper Dragon noodles: dry, bland, I asked for veggies and received 3 whole small pieces of vegetables...with a nice additional charge Pad Thai: was edible, nothing to write home about tom yum: was possibly the worst I have ever had! I probably try 15-25 new places each year and this one wins the award of worst so far...  Service: possible the worst service I've had for the price of the food.  Atmosphere: we sat on the \"beautiful patio\" there were several pigeons in the rafters. Feathers and bird gifts were all over the tables, chairs, and landing near our food.  The two stars are for the location and hostess who was super pleasant. Besides that I don't plan on returning to this overpriced, bland food creating establishment.",

And the prices for the rice nor the size isn't even on the online menu. Assuming someone wants to spend $17 for a box of rice is not good business practice. AND you can't charge $17 for veggie rice, and $17 for chicken or beef. It makes no sense. Also, manager says \"it's not the order taker responsibly to tell someone the menu and help them place the order\".",

We had the Thai platter as a starting appetizer to get a sample of all the appetizers   There wasn't one that wasn't great - and the variety of sauces perfectly complemented each unique item.   Then the fire Thai lettuce wraps were next. The chicken is perfectly cooked with just the right amount of crunch and the sauce had a great heat (we asked for a 4 out of 5).    Don't miss the star dish - the coco chili fish. I'd read another Yelp review suggesting it -they were right! There's the right amount of coconut flavor blended with the chile heat. I was worried it would be sweet but it wasn't. Fish was perfectly cooked beneath the great sauce.     Fun drink menu too.   We can't wait to go again and try more!",

I was pleasantly greeted at the door on the way in and on the way out. Bathrooms were clean and even had mouth wash which is a nice touch. Pretty extensive menu. I had chicken satay and pad thai, both were very good but I wouldn't say great, hence the 4 star, but maybe some other things are better.

We just moved back to AZ and went to Malee's for our 17th Wedding Anniversary. The calamari and booze was good but Pad Thai smelt like something was rotting. Kind of like rotting cabbage but with a bad smell and taste. I informed the waiter about it who didn't bother doing anything about it and walked away. Poor service right there. We ordered several dishes and I am not sure if the cook was tired because the food was not tasty and the Pad Thai was just inedible. It ruined our Anniversary dinner. I am not sure if the restaurant has gone down in quality or if they changed cooks but the food was not good.",

We were told the food would be ready in 45 minutes so we gave them an hour. When we arrived it wasn't ready but they had us review our receipt to make sure everything was in order (which it was). Then we waited for 25 minutes. And waited some more. And when it was ready, we assumed we got the right order. Buuuuut we didn't. We found we got someone's order once we got back. Awesome! So my husband called, they put him on hold for 5 minutes after he told them the issue... and they \"accidentally\" hung up. So then he called back and was told \"oh, I'll need to talk to my manager- let me take your number and I'll call you back.\" Ten minutes later, we had to call them back! Ultimately, they refunded the credit card charge and we ate what we were given. (Stay tuned for the food review...)",

I ordered the pad Thai and have you ever tasted something you order all the time and it's not the same but the difference was a good thing well in this case it's a great thing. Their pad Thai version is amazing. I did prefer the chicken over the shrimp (I got combo of both). The sauce and seasoning is delicious. I ordered it at a spice level of 3 of 5 because I've been to some Thai places where I've never replaced the layers of skin off the roof of my mouth but there wasn't enough heat for me. I def should've gone with a 4 which is considered Thai hot here and a 5 is \"chef hot\". Stop by and you will enjoy this unassuming Thai local.  *The star that's missing is on account of the staff. Although they weren't rude they also weren't very interactive.  I usually enjoy some banter with the bartender or server but in this case I was left alone for 90% of my 45 min lunch. I got the generic \"how's everything tasting?\" But small places like this are usually more friendly and personal.  I'll be back though!",

On my two past visits, the hostesses were oblivious to new diners coming in, unwelcoming, and seemingly irritated by having to do their job.   The service both times was poor -- lengthy wait to be asked if I'd like a drink, to order food, to receive food. My food was presented poorly and tasted worse. Having always ordered the same dishes, I was surprised at how they arrived and the taste, which was terribly lacking; I almost broke my tooth on something foreign in my noodle dish. I'm not sure who my server even was the other evening as they only returned to the table when I flagged them down to get the bill.   After several years of enjoying the food and good service at Malee's, I don't think I'll be giving them a third chance after the past two experiences in 2018 that have failed to live up to their previous standards.",

All I can say is that they were AMAZING! They were very attentive, and very well organized. For us being a party of about 23 people, they did an awesome job in making each one of us happy! Management was also awesome, I could tell that they wanted us to have a great time. The bartender that night was great, she made amazing drinks and was very kind! My party was set up in the small front room which was a perfect fit for us. So if you're looking to have a get together with about 20 people, Malee's Thai Bistro is the place for you! The food is also the best food in Scottsdale. I've been in 2 other times, and the food has always been very tasty.",

Sometimes the food is a little oily or greasy and does not come out prepare correctly. I again would give this place three and a half Stars only if Yelp would allow us to review and use 1/2 Stars which I think would make the reviews much more accurate.

One big plus for me: A gluten-free menu. My waiter and the manager were both very knowledgeable about the needs of people with celiac disease.  A big plus for the friends who took me to Malee's: It's a great place for vegetarians to eat.   The Tom Yum soup was so delicious that I can't wait to try it again. I can't remember the name of my main course, but it included chicken and vegetables in coconut milk. It was also very good.   I know the most reviews mention more than two dishes, but I wanted to post to spread the word that Malee's is a good place for people who follow a gluten-free or vegetarian diet.",

    "text": "A couple words can easily describe my review on Malee's: oily food, cold & incorrect orders and a cockroach.   I first found Malee's Thai Bistro through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FGroupon.com&s=3d66207072e27513e60dc78237a8b086644332131edcf09586a2588b0cb7a7f6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Groupon.com</a> when they ran their $20 for $40 coupon. My fiance and I are frequent Thai eaters so I thought I would be a good opportunity to get some great food at a discount. Boy was I wrong.   First thing you should know is that Malee's is not traditional Thai food. It's Thai with a twist and, in this case, not a good twist. We started with the Spring Rolls. Usually Thai spring rolls are tightly wrapped and not overly fried. These were neither. The rolls were messy and the cooking oil was dripping out of them.   My fiance and I ordered the Thai Basil Pasta no spice and Coco Chile Fish medium spice for the main course. The Thai Basil Pasta came out lukewarm and spicy. The Coco Chile Fish was oily and not spicy. Although both dishes were somewhat tasty, they simply didn't hit the mark.   To top it all off, we noticed a cockroach scurrying across the floor as we ate our dinner. Needless to say, we decided to pass on dessert and head home.   Do yourself a favor and try other local Thai restaurants. Thai Basil and Lemon Grass Cafe in Tempe blow Malee's out of the water.",

Their tofu is always prepared with excellence, and the chicken never dry or tasteless.  All the curries shine, but the Arizona Heat Wave (red curry) is fabuloso.  The restaurant itself is cozy, too.  Low ceilings, fun and interesting table placement - Malee's uses the uniqueness of their space to their full advantage.  I've never felt like I've intruded on anyone's conversation by accident, nor have I ever felt it happen to me.  The lunch special is a good deal, however it can be busy, so make sure you have the time.  I've been to Malee's on several occasions when a group comes in at 12:30 or 1, and then I can tell their upset because they're food doesn't come out with the speed of a drive up window.  This always bothers me.  Good food takes time, and Malee's is most definetly very good - so allow them the time to prepare it.  You'll be glad you did-",

It's been a couple of years since I've last been to Malee's but I'm certain that it was a romantic, dimly lit, comfortable quiet restaurant.  Something of a treat.    Unfortunately, this location didn't resemble Desert Ridge in the slightest. The dining room area to our left was fairly small, and noisy and well lit.  The atmosphere: rather casual.  My friends and I definitely felt out of place, and way overdressed for a Saturday night.   The tables felt crowded with plates and silverware already pre-served, which was kind of annoying because when our dishes came out, we were asked if we wanted to eat from the plate it came on, or if wanted to transfer our food onto the plates provided on the table.   Doesn't make sense.  We stuck with the plates the food was served on.    On to the menu:  Another thing I seem to remember at the Desert Ridge Location, they offered Sushi.  There was no menu for Sushi at this location.  Was it that they just didn't provide a sushi menu unless asked for?  Or do they just don't serve it all?  I suppose, if they don't advertise it, it's probably best to just avoid the question all together.   Just a guess.   I ordered the grilled chicken over spinach dish, mild.  Now this may or may not be worth noting, but I don't think my watch lapsed a full 5 minutes before we were served with our food.  This is wonderful, when you're at a fast food joint like Mc D's, but at a Thai restaurant?  I'm not so sure how I feel about that.    By the way, Mild stands for : no kick to it at all.  Don't be scared to go with the medium.  Take it from someone who is a baby when it comes to hot spicey foods!  On to the great part: 3 dishes, 2 glasses of wine, 1 vodka Stoli: $62.00.  Nice.    I wish I liked this place better, I really do.  Unfortunately, it's just no the Malee's I know and loved at Desert Ridge.  Normally, I hate the whole Scottsdale atmosphere, but in this case, it is what I expected walking in and I was sorely disappointed.",

Pros:  - cozy and quaint patio seating - decent number of offerings on the menu - few asian food choices (non-bar) in the old town area  Cons: - inconsistent food quality  - can't execute basics like Pad Thai? - not really Thai but more fusion/ new american/ arizona/west influences - prices are on the mid-high side",

Sometimes the servers get busy, sometimes its loud but overall its awesome. Noticed a couple of wanna be clown restaurant critics gave weak reviews based on their warped version of a Thai Restaurant. If they wanted 100% Thai then write one from Thailand where you can get it off the street or down to Thai Hut on McDowell which are both awesome. I like fusion and hot. Half these people would be calling an ambulance after dinner if they new authentic Thai.   If you want a great fusion of what works in Scottsdale and sometimes requires reservation because it works so well then head on over to Malee's.   Ginger Broccoli, Cashew Chicken..its all good.   I love this place and it gets five stars.  John",

That being said, my new discovery at Malee's is Chef Hot, which is double Thai hot. WOW. Talk about eye-watering satisfaction. I tried it with the crispy basil chicken, but I think next time I'll try it with something that has more of a sauce--like the red curry (Arizona Heatwave).   I've tried the drunken dragon noodles, the aforementioned Arizona heatwave and crispy basil chicken, the roasted duck, the beef-with-some-sort-of-garlic sauce, and the Thai chow mein. My favorite is the crispy basil chicken, but the red curry is the best I've had. It's got a subtle smokiness I just love.  Malee's takes reservations, which is great for the weekends and crowds. I usually for with at least four other people for dinner, so I definitely give Malee's a holler before.  Malee's is a bit more pricey than your average mom-and-pop Thai place, but I think it's worth it every now and then. :)",

I had the Beef Panang Curry and my lunch partner had the Pad Thai. The beef was not overcooked at all, so it was still tender and the sauce had just the right amount of heat for me. We both really enjoyed the chicken won ton soup that came with our lunch.   My only complaint about this place would be that I think the prices are way too high for lunch. They do have a lunch menu, even though it is not posted on their website, but most of he dishes are still $9.95! You do get either soup or salad, but the portion size is much smaller than the dinner portion. Some of my other favorite Thai places, Thai House & Takeda, have lunch specials in the $6-8 range, which I think is much more appropriate.   If I am wanting a nice Thai dinner, I would definitely splurge on Malee's. The Thai toast, Tom Ka Gai and Pork Lettuce wraps are all delicious, but I think I will pass on it for lunch.",

We got all the way over to the stadium to find a huge line of cars to park, no parking spaces, and a sold out game. UGH. So, we turned around and headed back to Scottsdale to get some food. I remembered this place on my \"to eat\" list from YELP. We found it on the blackberry and off we went.   It was not very crowded. We were seated right away. Our seater and server were very nice. The server made recommendations, one being the soup choice. It was not a super hot day, so we were opting for soup and he said the presentation of this one particular soup was very good... flames. I believe it was chicken wonton soup.  We also ordered the drunken dragon noodles and a vegetable dish (that I just cannot remember right now.)    The waiter was correct, the presentation of the soup was great. I even took pictures, as hard as it is to get flames on film. The plates were all average sized, but plenty for the two of us. The food was all quite good, though a bit on the pricier side for thai.   Overall, I think an excellent selection for the evening. Good relaxed, nice place with good staff, good food and even a baseball player sighting (though we have no idea who he was, probably a minor leaguer).",

If you're looking for Thai on a ramen budget, I recommend Thai Basil on University Dr.  But if you've got $13 for an amazing Thai dinner, I suggest the Drunken Dragon noodles.  Everything I've had here has been flavorful.    A note about spicy food:  As Thai restaurants go, this one is on the hotter end.  Though I typically order my food \"Thai Hot\" at other restaurants, I typically stick to \"Very Hot\" here because it's sooo hot.  Just a note of caution :)  The service is occasionally at a slower pace than I would like, but I attribute this mostly to their crowds of customers rather than inefficiency.  Perhaps the best reason to go to Malee's for your first Thai meal?  The staff are incredibly good at keeping your water glass full- a necessity when trying those spicy entrees.",

Learned so much about Thai cooking. We learned how to make Crispy Basil Chicken, Red Thai Curry Paste, Roasted Chili Reduction Sauce & Tom Ka Gai Soup. Everything was so delicious. Anybody wanting to try some Thai food need to go to Malee's. Their CoCo Chili Fish & Drunken Dragon Noodles are favorites of our's.

    "text": "I have to say I am thoroughly disappointed. I expected much more from a restaurant on Main Street in Scottsdale. I ordered fried spring rolls, panang curry chicken, pad Thai, and chicken fried rice. I spent two years in Thailand and seek out Thai restaurants across the US. Thai is my favorite food and nothing at this restaurant tasted as I would have expected.   The spring rolls were like over-cooked egg rolls filled with nothing but noodles, and I couldn't believe they were served with sweet and sour sauce. I have never been to a Thai restaurant that served anything but sweet chili/peanut sauce with their spring rolls.   The panang curry was alright, but I love being able to taste the panang and coconut milk flavors, this I couldn't, it seemed more like gravy than a curry. The white rice that accompanied it was sticky, but to the point of a paste. I was expecting some light jasmine rice, a rice often served in Thai restaurants, but I can't imagine that this was. This was the same used in the fried rice, there were clumps of matted flavorless rice all the way through. The dish itself had plenty of vegetables but no flavor and it didn't seem like much egg either. To me it was more of a rice stir fry with unseasoned and over-cooked chicken. (The only reason I ordered fried rice in a Thai restaurant is for my son).  The pad Thai tasted as though it came out of a pre-packaged, store-bought pad Thai kit rather than a restaurant, the flavor being off and the noodles completely over cooked. It was a salty dish, when it should be slightly sweet, like the balance between the tamarind juice, palm sugar, and fish sauce was wrong, if the traditional ingredients were even used.   Unfortunately I can't speak to the quality of the restaurant or the service because I took the order to go, but based on the taste of the food I will never return.",

The calamari was heavily fried almost like onion rings and it looked pretty dubious but it was very good- dipping sauce nice as well.  Duck Curry was some of the best I've ever had. The Drunken Noodles wasn't the best I've had but it was decent enough. Should have tried their Pad Thai.  Malee's favorite stir fry wasn't particularly impressive nor the beef and broccoli.

We arrived at 11:00a on the nose and were very cheerfully greeted at the door. We were told we could have our pick of any seat as they had literally JUST opened for the day.  I was immediately impressed by the enthusiastic welcome and further impressed by the clean, modern feel of the interior. We found a spot and got settled.  We decided to order a couple of appetizers and share the Crispy Basil Chicken order. And it's a good thing we did! The order was huge. We couldn't finish it all between us.  Another important note: the young man that served us was great. I forgot to get his name, but he was very polite and super helpful. Really great service there, too.  Malee's gets four stars because, while the food portions were very acceptable, the food itself was just kind of blah for me. Obviously American fusion style Thai. Just ok.  I'd give Malee's a 3 star review for the high prices and for the food (because I'm a snob about authentic Thai), but they win the extra star EASILY because of service and experience.  Thanks, Malee's team, for a very nice \"brunch\" this weekend.   :)",

At first I thought it was because I ordered my food with \"medium\" heat, so next time I asked for \"hot\" heat, but there was no difference in the spiciness/flavor at all.   Also, the mango and sticky rice was very disappointing, especially at the $6 price point! The tiny square of rice was so very small and the dish was, overall, kind of flavorless.

Between 4 of us we ordered a pot of Tom Ka Gai soup (best soup I've ever tasted and would go back tomorrow for this alone), shrimp pad thai, chicken panang curry, jalapeno fried rice, crab rangoon, and the burma gai. Everything was outstanding and so full of flavor. The only weak dish was the crab rangoon, but I'm also pretty picky about my rangoon. The rest of it though....fuggetaboutit.   Finally found a Thai place in AZ that I can rave about. Yummo!",

    "text": "So I've been to Malee's 4-5 times. It goes without saying, but I love this place.  The location is perfect, the atmosphere is perfect, the ambiance is perfect (especially for a dinner date!), and the pricing and portions are reasonable.  I usually like to try different things on the menu, but since the very first time I've gone to Malee's, I've always ordered the Yellow Curry.  The first time I ordered it, I ordered 4/5 spice.  Wasn't spicy enough.  I felt a minor tingle on my tongue, but wasn't satisfied.  After my second visit, I ordered the same dish, but 5/5 spice this time.  And let me tell you guys... Each time I request 5/5 spice, the waiter/waitress always asks me, \"are you sure? you know that's chef's spice, right?\" The first time they asked me that, I just nodded my head and secretly thought to myself, \"oh please.  I can handle my spice.\"  And then my yellow curry came out, but it wasn't yellow.  It was red.  The dish is extremely flavorful.  It's loaded with chicken (if you order chicken, obviously), carrots and potatoes.  It's got a thick, creamy coconut base, but it isn't too heavy.  It comes with a side of rice, too.  But most importantly, this dish is ACTUALLY S P I C Y.  My tongue was on fire, I was sweating like a pig, and I actually drank my glass of water.  For those of you who think you can handle spice, I'd definitely recommend trying the yellow curry 5/5 spice.  Although, I'd recommend bringing a couple of Tums, just in case.  Oh and if you're ordering take-out and you decide to microwave the curry, be sure to cover your eyes, nose and mouth.  You've been warned. Enjoy! .",

The food arrived quickly and I ordered it through Door Dash.  They were able to make honor my request of having no bell peppers in it, so I was pleased when they weren't in the curry.  The curry itself was a little watery than what I'm used to and they included veggies that I've never seen in yellow curry before; baby corn sticks and broccoli.  I really liked the corn and they give you a larger portion of rice, than what most Thai places give you.  Pricing is normal, my curry was $14.99 and I did tofu and not meat.  Of course I had a few dollars worth of delivery and service fee's, but that has nothing to do with the restaurant.",

Not one dish ordered had any influence from Thailand. Do yall have fish sauce? The appeal is definitely for people who are allergic to seasoning, flavor, and have NEVER consulted with an actual person from Thailand. I was so disappointed.  75 bucks of trash. They put so much ice in your cocktail its equivalent to a shot. But drink that shot fast because once the ice melts its water punch and you're going to need it to wash down this trash food. I l love ethnic food and I'm appalled they claim to represent a country with so much flavor.",

Now that's out of the way, the food was flavorful (just not what I expected). My friends and I ordered the following: chicken satay, mint chicken wrap (larb), Panang curry, and the crispy basil chicken. As I said, the flavors were good but there were some minuses. The chicken satay was dry and the \"larb\" was not larb in a Thai sense. I don't feel the menu's description quite described the dish correctly. Larb isn't generally served in a \"sauce\" but this version appeared to be prepared in a tamarind type sauce (I may be incorrect but there was definitely a sauce of some sort). My favorite dish was the crispy basil chicken, which I can say I've never had anything like it at any other Thai restaurant (been to tons).  Besides the food, the alcoholic drinks we had were tasty, and the service and atmosphere was good.   Overall, I recommend this place but like I said at the top, don't expect authentic Thai.",

The server warned me it would be a bit spicy but I don't know what he was talking about because it was not spicy at all haha. So next time I'd get it just a bit spicier! It was so flavorful though. My boyfriend got pad thai and said it was some of the best he's had. We were both really happy with our food!

Flies everywhere because \"someone left the window open in the kitchen.\" I counted at least 5 before we were moved to another table further from the door.  2. The one guy working with a dirty black t-shirt just moved our same napkins and utensils and threw them on our new table. We had to ask for them to replace everything. He seemed overworked or just didn't care- not the greatest service for a palce that charges $3.25 for a diet coke.  3. Madras curry tasted like warm tumeric juice. It was a light broth that lacked the punch of thai curries. (Speaking as someone who has been here before and really enjoyed our meals only a few months ago). 4. Fried fish looked white andunder-fried- mango salsa on top was okay though. We've ordered this before and the contrast is striking.  5. One waitress to serve everyone between 3-4 pm. She was sweet and I could tell she was pained to hear other complaints and passive aggresiveness from others waiting for her service. We wanted to order more food but could not. 6. It was my mom's birthday, but the dessert didn't come with anything even after they assured us \"they will take care of it\" with a smile. Mango with sticky rice- the rice lacked any milk.  7. $68 for a coke, curry, fried fish, spring rolls, and sticky rice in a Scottsdale restaurant with flies and one server.",

Though I haven't had them myself, my family also loves the evil jungle princess and yellow curry.  Service is always consistent and friendly here. You can tell it's a family-owned/run restaurant and they do a great summer special so be sure to ask if it's still on! :)",

I've always had the best experiences in traditional, shopping center or strip mall Thai spots but thought since I was in Scottsdale, I would try mainstream and wasn't impressed.    I order the veggie summer rolls with smoked tofu (which I've never seen on a menu), thinking it would be nice to try something new.  The portion size was good, however, it was mostly glass noodles and lettuce with once slim piece of tofu and minimal carrots.  The peanut hosin sauce was pretty good, but tasted of BBQ sauce more than peanut.  I chose the Arizona Heatwave as my main entree with fried tofu and medium hot.  The spicyness of the dish was pretty good however, there was more curry sauce than anything else in the bowl.  I'm accustomed to getting large chunks of peppers, onions, bamboo shoots and carrots but there were hardly any vegetables besides celery.  Tofu was plentiful but I ordered the dish for the veggies.  I'm thinking I may have gone here on an off night because the meal didn't live up to my expectations based on other's experiences.",

Sometimes \"Thai Hot\" is mild, other times it sets my mouth on fire for the same dish.    The happy hour menu is a deal at three small plates for $20 (limited menu) and $5 appetizers.  Ambiance varies depending on where you are seated and the time of day.  It can get quite busy and loud during the dinner rush.  The frequent diners club is a deal, everyone should join.  You get a free entree on your birthday, and coupons for anniversaries and other events.  This is my go-to place when I don't want to make dinner.",

We got the Drunken Dragon noodles - pretty bland taste; just noodles, overcooked small bits of chicken, and some bland tomatoes.  We also had the seafood curry.  It was a decent taste, and even the calamari was fairly tender.  It was just... boring, which is not an adjective I usually think of with Thai food.    Our shumai came with a pretty one-note sugary soy sauce as a dip, as well as sriracha and a yellow mustard.   I know there are nice garlicky Thai hot sauces...I like sriracha, but just surprised I got it.  (Especially alongside some French's)  Also was surprised that medium had barely any heat, even when the waiter warned us that the curry started at an initial level that was pretty spicy.  Overall, it wasn't offensive but I will never go back.",

The pad Thai was very good, but a touch too spicy. I wasn't sure if I could order it with a different spice amount, but I certainly would have if I knew. Overall it was enjoyable, but not super fabulous. The service was good though, I got take out and it was ready right when they said it would be (in 15 minutes).",

We were seated by a very friendly host, next to a map of Thailand painted on the wall and the bar opposite. I felt a little like I'd been put in the back 40.   Waiter was nice but a little clueless; I asked for a reco on what the house did best. He totally stammered and stared at his feet and finally said 'a lot of people get the whole fish'. Not wowed. A nice wine list helped but I have had better Thai food elsewhere. No kefir lime leaves in the Panang, no fresh basil...I get it was their version but I didn't think it was great and neither did the lovely. To top it off, stammering waiter man/boy brings the check and says did you want anything for desert? Um. No thanks.   It would have been a pricey meal had we not had the Groupon [$40 food for $20]. $52 plus tip for just okay and not such a nice atmosphere? I say, meh.",

I was a bit taken back by the american rock-pop music that was playing and felt that some authentic Thai music would have suited the place better. The dish I ordered (spicy teriyaki crunchy chicken) was not spicy at all and the chicken was hard to find around huge thickly breaded and deep fried chunks of batter. I really don't recall ever tasting the actual chicken. If this dish had real pieces of chicken and some real spice it would have been good. The teriyaki sauce was a nice flavor. It's a shame because I had high hopes for this place.",

First, the lunch came out before we were finished our salads.  It was not made to order. Came out way too fast.  The lunch was not even warm in temp.  I looked at the dish and thought the waitress had brought the wrong dishes.  The dish was supposed to be rice noodles, chicken, shrimp, bean sprouts and egg in sweet paprika vinaigrette.   It looked like a mushy mess of tomato paste and you could not tell one ingredient from another.   I tasted it and told my friend, there is not any hot to this dish.  Are you sure you did not get mine?   She said, no hot here either.  What a disappointment.  I had two shrimp and some chicken but they had no taste due to the extra strong red sauce.  We both left our plates unfinished.  Probably won't be going back.",

I last visited Malee's for a business lunch with a client.  He is very familiar with Thai food, so he knew exactly what he wanted from the menu and ordered it with \"medium\" spiciness (also called 2 stars).  We had the salad first, which my client said was good, but not excellent.  Upon trying his meal, however, he said the food was too spicy to even enjoy...far beyond \"medium.\"  It was so spicy he actually would not eat another bite.  The server kindly offered to bring him a different item on the menu, which he accepted, but I felt the damage was already done.  I had recommended this restaurant, and it was a disappointment to my client.  Then, after my client's new meal was delivered, it became very difficult to get our server's attention again.  In the future, I would just keep in mind that Malee's dishes are served spicier than you might normally expect, and then hopefully avoid the experience I had last week.",

    "text": "First time my fiance and I were there (happy hour) there weren't that many people in the restaurant and the food was soooo good (we got crispy basil chicken, pad thai, green curry, and drunken noodles) this place immediately became our best thai restaurant to go to.   2 days ago went to the restaurant again with work people telling them it is the best thai place around here, we were very disappointed with the food. It was a busy dinner time with lots of people so maybe that's why the food wasn't that great?  The table attendants were super proactive, but food was bland and not yummy :'( (Plus I like my pad kee Mao with flat rice noodles not with pad thai noodles)  To summarize, first visit, 5 stars, second visit, 3 stars.",

Actually, I take that back, their creme brulee was pretty amazing, but the Thai food was just OK. I *love* that I don't ever have to worry about something being too spicy or that I might go home with food poisoning (hence why it's good for business dinners), but I never CRAVE their food. There are just too many hole-in-the-wall Thai places with better food that blow this place out of the water.",

    "text": "Them an Arizona native and the growth in Scottsdale so this place used to be one of my regular spots way back in the day. I live in the far southeast Valley now and rarely come out to Snottsdale anymore. My wife and I did a staycation at a local resort and we decided to come into here and really glad we did. It seems to be a lost art these days our servers that give a crap about their trade and are knowledgeable about the product that they serve. Our server was a delightful gal who knew the menu inside and out and instead of just taking an order was a menu guider.  We started with the puh-puh platter that they call \"the taste of Thai\" it was an excellent selection at $14. It had spring rolls, chicken satay, crab Rangoon, potstickers etc. they came with all of these really cool sauces to. Loved it.  My wife rather picky about what she eats usually sticks to the main staples especially when it comes to Asian food. She ordered a Mandarin chicken and as soon as they put it down I could see that she wasn't going to like it as she eats a lot with her eyes and not her mouth. Sure enough she tried it and didn't like it is that orange peel gives off kind of a burnt taste. That's all her and her pickiness because I tried it and I thought it was fantastic don't judge her lack of taste. The server is gracious enough to bring her a replacement plate of teriyaki chicken. They put a rush on the order came out rather quickly and that chicken was absolutely out of this world. It was cooked crispy perfectly and seasoned wonderfully. She said it was the best teriyaki chicken she's ever had. I agree with her.  I had a seafood curry that had scallops and shrimp, call Mari, muscles and fish it was served in a spicy red curry sauce. Server asked me on a scale of 1 to 5 about the heat index and I said a three. Three is hot so be forewarned as I was sweating to the oldies eating that dish. The curry flavor was exceptional.  We also had a bowl of chicken wonton soup that had I think was spinach in it but also these incredibly good chicken dumplings. The ingredients are really good however the broth needed salt.   I love this place can't wait to go again!",

First, Chris the head chef and owner Diadre could not of been better hosts and hostesses.   Second, it was terrific to hand make all our courses, taste them, and then take away what we made from scratch and sit down 10 minutes latter and have a wonderful sit down lunch with 3 wine choices. How much better does it get.  I won't go through each course, but the courses revolved around a lettuce wrap, noodle salad, wonderful fried fish and unbelievable brown rice. Each was joined with 5 to 15 seasonings or spices.  Was all in all a 5 star lunch and strongly recommend  being part of Malee's email list so you can enjoy the experience yourself!",

Needless to say the food is amazing. The food is both classical and contemporary thai cuisine thanks to the owner and her head chef who's from Thailand.  My favorite dish is the pad thai. While a street merchant food by nature, Malee's is the perfect blend of spicy and sour to make a noodle dish worth talking about. I've been to many other places looking for something close to home that compares. But the only place closed last year. So the drive to Scottsdale is well worth it.  Thai food has definitely increased in popularity over the last few years but there's only one that I will always go to. My favorite and always will be. The cooking classes are fun too. What's not to love.",

For me, It was just OK, but like I said I've tried a ton of Thai places in NYC and there is a certain level of expectation. Nonetheless, if you are in the area of old Scottsdale you should try this place out.",

I have had the duck curry and the roast duck, while both are good, I prefer the roast duck.  I've ordered duck at a couple of Thai restaurants and this place is at the top of my list!  My dinner dates and I have all ordered duck, so I can't comment on anything else on the menu.  I have had the spring roll appetizer, which was not what I expected (because I think they were little puffs with thin noodles), but tasty.  What I like about the roast duck versus the curry is that the meat isn't drowned in a sauce (I do like curry!) and you can enjoy the meat a bit more, plus, you get the dipping sauce for a little extra flavor.  I liked the spinach that comes with it, which also tastes good with the meat or with some of the sauce.  Their painkiller cocktail drink is my favorite cocktail drink in the valley so far; I've ordered it every visit!  Very tasty.",

I tried many Thai food restaurants, but to me, this place is the most delicious and has the most unique & creative dishes!   Even when they are really packed, we tend to get seated in a reasonable time! They have a very pretty outdoors/patio seating that overlooks Main Street in old town Scottsdale. You get to see the lights along the whole street at night!   These are the items we tried (over the course of last year): For appetizers: Siamese kisses, Thai toast, and chicken satay   For soup: Tom Ka Gai  Entrees: Crispy mango fish, drunken dragon noodles, Thai basil pasta and Burma Gai (my favorite)  Everything I listed above was so tasty and flavorful!  One amazing thing to keep in mind is that they can customize any dish to your heart's content. This means that, if you wanted to, you can change and/or remove the type of meat and vegetables that the dishes contain.  Service is very good! I have no complaints. And they politely let everybody stay past their closing time, without making you feel like you have to rush!  Overall, a meal and patio seating that I always look forward to :)",

The food is tasty, but very little seems authentic. The Tom Yum soup that I had was made with Western ingredients (wrong mushrooms, for example), with only a slight nod to the famous soup that I was expecting to taste. I was disappointed. The rolls we had were also very Westernized, and the dish my friend had was almost Chinese. In fact, there's a lot about this restaurant that screams Chinese, and it seems like the attempt at Thai flavors was merely an afterthought.

It's served with a soy based sweet dipping sauce, sambal, and what I could only describe as a curried mustard which was fantastic.    I got a pot of the Tom Ka Gai soup.  I have dreams about it every night now.  It's so freaking delicious!!  I ate about half the pot so I was lucky enough to have the rest for lunch the next day.  My husband got the small order of Pad Thai which ended up being really big!  He asked them to make it as spicy as possible.  It was really delicious but he didn't think it was very spicy.  It's nothing against them though, he's a total freak of nature when it comes to spicy food and I've never seen him think something was hot enough.  He still thoroughly enjoyed and said he would definitely order it again.    We ended our meal with the pumpkin custard.  It was insanely good.  They cook inside a sugar pumpkin and just cut pieces out of the pumpkin to serve it.  It tasted like the best pumpkin pie you'd ever had with a hint of coconut.  I only wish we had ordered two instead of sharing one.  Our server was fantastic too.  We sat outside, we were the only people sitting outside and I didn't feel like we were being ignored at all.  He was very attentive and nice!  We had all that food, my husband had a drink with alcohol, and I had a soda, the bill was $44 before tip which isn't bad at all.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I could eat here every day. Finally went with my sis and we started with the Basil Curry Clams for an appetizer and each ordered a specialty cocktail. The clams were cooked perfectly and the sauce they were served with...well, it was imperative to have rice just to be able to indulge.   For dinner we split the Burma Gai and the Tom Ka Gai soup. After the soup, I was curious if an additional plate was even necessary. We were glad we did. Both were rich and delicious with just the right amount of spice. There was enough left over for my BF and I for dinner the next night - a rarity as I'm sure I had seconds of the soup while we were there.   We ordered all food medium in spice level so we would be able to figure out their specific heat levels - and we wanted to actually taste the food. I may bump it up a level next time...which I hope is very soon. Highly recommend this place - one of the best Thai places I've experienced so far.",

    "text": "A friend recommended Malee's to us just as we arrived in town and told him where we were staying. Malee's was three minutes away, so we zipped over there and were seated immediately on a VERY busy Monday night.  The service is incredible there. Even though the place was packed (and very noisy, due to the presence of a party of 14 seated just next to us), the wait staff and bussers were right on everything. As a former waiter (10 years in excellent restaurants in San Diego), I am generally pretty attuned to quality service. These people were obviously very well-trained; it was very impressive to see their coordination and cooperation with each other.  But, there is a reason I mentioned the service first. It's five star service, but unfortunately the food does not live up to that billing. My girlfriend and I love Thai, and we try to find a good Thai place whenever we travel. It's hard to find anything as good as Lanna Thai in Pacific Beach (San Diego), and this was no exception.  We got their veggie rolls for starters, and those came with a Plum Poison sauce that was very good. Unfortunately, it could not rescue the amazingly bland (though very fresh) rolls, which lacked any flavor despite the fresh ingredients. Our assessment was that fresh rolls without mint or cilantro or basil or SOMETHING are just rice noodles with no flavor. (again- if you want the best, go to Lanna Thai for these!) We had a Pad noodle dish that was also fairly disappointing. The only food item that was the least bit impressive was the yellow curry veggies.   Lastly, a word of advice. If you're going to dine there in the winter (we ate there on February 23), take some warm clothing. The place was FREEZING. We could not wait to get out of there- only due to that one factor. The ambiance is really good- there was live music playing in the other room. But if you don't make the temperature of the restaurant accommodating, people will be shivering while they try to enjoy the cuisine.   That's all.",

Since then, I split my money and visits between the two. Malee's has an upscale environment for Thai and is situated in old Town Scottsdale. White table clothes and excellent service. As an appetizer I always get the Siamese kisses- which are shumai dumplings with chicken, shrimp and spices- amazing! The slow roasted duck curry is something I've never had before but is one of my favorites now but you also can't go wrong with the Arizona heatwave. Don't let the spices scare you- go all the way to Thai hot- still flavorful and you will not regret it on your flight the next day. Love this place!",

I like a lot of Asian food but usually do not like Thai (I don't like it because Phoenix thai offerings are not good, Thai food in general is awesome if made correctly). Most thai places in Phoenix are really bland and \"Americanized\" but this place has much more flavor. It is the service that takes off one star...two times in a row this week had to beg to be served by someone. It also took forever just to get seated. The servers are nice but maybe their system is a bit off with assigning tables? The tom kha soup is great, the Thai iced tea is well balanced and isn't overly sweet, and the dishes in general are just really good. This place blows away pretty much every other Thai places I've tried in Phoenix. I crave coming to this place...

First, I must mention that it is perfectly located in the Old Town Scottsdale gallery district with so many fun things to do around it (escape room, painting classes, galleries, bars, etc.) So, if you're looking to go out afterwards, Malee's is a great spot for dinner with a bunch of friends or a date night.  We started with their fresh spring rolls and enjoyed them! They came with 4 halves so it was perfect for the two of us to split before our meal.  For dinner, we split the Pad Thai (comes with chicken and shrimp) and the Massaman Curry. The Pad Thai noodles were a little mushy for my liking but I LOVED the curry! We ordered pork with the curry and I would probably go for chicken next time. The pork meat was a little on the darker side which isn't my favorite. They offer two different portion size options which is actually pretty cool! For two people, if you're splitting two or more entrees, the smaller portion is definitely sufficient. We still had a serving size of each to take home for leftovers.  All in all, the service was very friendly and attentive and the food was good. We'd definitely come again!",

The three unhappy eaters ordered the Hippy Noodles because the waitress said it was just like Pad See Ew. Before I placed my order I asked what was in it just to be sure and I was told just broccoli and carrots, so I asked them to remove the broccoli due to a food intolerance. When the dishes came out all of the ones that didn't request a plain dish had plates covered in onions and bean sprouts. I had to send it back since I have an intolerance to onions. They were apologetic and quickly cooked a new plate, but when I finally got to taste it the taste was off and the carrots were barely cooked. In the end we all agreed that was not a traditional Pad See Ew and the taste was off.  The other two picked at theirs, but they were not happy about the situation. Chefs should feel free to put a creative spin on their dishes, but just give customers a heads up so they can either order something different or adjust their order.   Price:  My dinner portion cost me $20 with beef, which was very over priced.  Atmosphere:  Nice.",

The servings are offered in both large and small sizes so sharing is optional but the small size is more than a servings worth. Expected prices for Thai food. Both brown rice and white rice are available. I always get the peanut curry. Being vegetarian there are a ton of options for me to choose from! I also love the spinach tofu potstickers! I will definitely be back soon!",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Malee's last Saturday night. We hadn't been there in several years but some friends told us that the food was still very good and so we made a reservation through Yelp and went. We arrived a few minutes early but were greeted by someone with absolutely no customer service skills, who seated us in the bar at a table in the entrance where people were entering and leaving. The two dining rooms had plenty of available tables and so my wife requested a more desirable location. The greeter appeared angry at the request and stated that there were many reservations coming soon. She seemed to ignore the fact that we also had a reservation.  She then brought us into the small dining room and said we only could sit at one of two tables, both of which were also in the entry way. There were several other more desirable tables available for two. I cannot fathom why we were seated there and denied the chance to sit at a better table. We thought at first that perhaps they planned on moving two tables together due to reservations for a larger party. But about 5 minutes after we agreed to sit, they filled these tables with other couples. Did they not only make a reservation but requested a specific table? Doubtful as this happened with several tables. The greeter was absolutely terrible and essentially lost this restaurant the chance that I will be back any time soon.  I will add in fairness that our waiter was very pleasant and the food was quite good. But being treated so poorly by the greeter so turned us off that they lost potential regular diners. Too bad!",

I asked if the restaurant could make CHOO CHEE, not sushi.  Your bartender told me to go to another restaurant.  I repeatedly told her I am not interested in sushi I have a question if you make CHOO CHEE.  She stated she has no idea but no.  I ordered Panang Curry, an alternative to CHOO CHEE on your menu imo.  Not difficult to make either.  An hour later, not 40 minutes, I asked for an update.  She stated maybe 10-20 minutes.  I stated cancel the order and I will pay what I owe.  She said no bill and goodbye.  Teach your bartenders 2 skills.  Be polite.  Listen to customers.   Cheers.   Scott",

Unfortunately, our experience went down hill quickly. The spring rolls were odd shaped and a bit greasy. The drunken noodles and Pad Thai were just not good. Usually thai restaurants pride themselves in the Pad Thai, often known as the national dish of Thailand. I will potentially go back and get Tom Ka soup carryout, but thats about it",

    "text": "Malee's Thai Bistro offers a decent Thai experience in Scottsdale.They deliver through Postmates, but also have an intimate dining area with design elements that reminds you of a house.  If you're used to traditional names for Thai food, get ready for creative license. Red vegetable curry is now Arizona heatwave, drunken noodles are now drunken dragon noodles (note: not actually dragon noodles), etc. You get the idea.  The food was okay. Malee's is probably 40% more expensive than Thai Basil and Thai Elephant Bistro in Tempe, but I probably couldn't tell you the difference between the curries. The engaging atmosphere is worth some of that delta.   The tofu spinach dumplings were fantastic, despite having wrappers that didn't quite feel familiar. The pad thai stood a few inches taller than the red curry.  The online menu separated out vegetarian options, which was very helpful.  When leaving the restaurant, some drunk stranger (there tend to be a few stumbling around Scottsdale) yelled out at the group of us, \"WAS IT GOOD?\" Everyone ignored him, but me. I told him I enjoyed it, and that he should try it.   I regret putting the ball in Malee's court to handle him, but the man, seemingly unaware of today's Yelps of the world, was doing what everyone reading this review is doing, only in a more visceral, confrontational way.",

This place was over priced Americanized Thai food.   We ordered the drunkin noodles, the beef walnut stir fry, the Thai appetizer platter and the papaya salad. The drunkin' noodles had the thin pad Thai noodles when it usually has the flat rice noodles, the meet was crumbling and there were no vegetables at all. The papaya salad barely had any papaya in it with no real flavor, the best part about appetizer platter was the different types of sauces. Honestly the only appetizing meal was the stir fry.   In conclusion, the only great thing about this place was the ambiance and the out door seating. Otherwise I'd take your money to another Thai place. If it helps at all, I've had better Thai food in the middle of no where south India.",

Went with two co-workers on my business trip because the one guy used to live here and he took his wife here on a date once and remembered it being good. It was cool to see Scottsdale because for the most part, we were confined to the Phoenix-Tempe area.  Nice decor in here, and we actually ended up sitting semi outside...in their covered patio area.  Wasn't too cold for April.  I ordered the Summer Rolls (yes, I endured some mild-friendly-harassment from my co-workers for taking pics of my food, lol) and requested they add basil to them. They were delicious and filling. The dipping sauce was good but I couldn't eat the other sauce because it was too spicy. My co-workers thoroughly enjoyed their food. I also got a (huge) Sapporo beer. Their desserts sounded good but I was too full to eat anymore!   Server was awesome and slightly silly. I'd return next time I go to AZ!",

The portions are large too, which is good since you won't want to put your fork down!  Just beware, once you try Malee's you will start to crave it ALL the time - it's that yummy.  Woohoo!

We ordered a couple entrees to share and the food were definitely not Thai food, it's more like Thai imitation. Anyway, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It was okay in term of taste. The reason I gave it two stars instead of three was because all the items on the menu were expensive.",

With that said I thought their version of Kang Karie was good, nicely balanced flavor to the curry, but the chicken was dry, as I find it seems to be everywhere.  The noodle dish was a bit difficult to maneuver, as the noodles were all glued together, but once we cut them all up it was manageable and the Chinese sausage added an interesting dimension of flavor with it's classic 5 spice taste.  The garnish of celery threw me for a loop, but I think I'm nit picking that one.  I liked that they offered two sizes of servings, especially since we were eating a very late lunch and had plans for dinner and did not want that spoiled.",

My beef with veggies in garlic sauce may have been good on an average day, but today tasted like beef that failed to be refrigerated, or was few weeks old, or was a beef-substitute ... Whatever it was, it caused me to get immediately nauseous!  After I told the pleasant waitress about it and she took the complaint inside (we were sitting outdoors) the hostess and who may have been the chef judging by the white apron, stepped outside just enough to take a look and went back in, no questions asked.  Other than the meat that tasted like less-than-fresh road kill, the behavior of the staff convinced me to share that experience with fellow yelpers and possibly warn someone the way I wish I had been warned ... the one star can stand for the good Thai iced tea ...

    "text": "Nice to find a cool younger crowd outside of Tempe which is refreshing for a lot of places in Phx, pretty casual and hipper atmosphere which we appreciated.  Sat our party of four relatively quickly on a Saturday night though we did have reservations.  Drinks came at a standard pace and the soup we all shared initially was decent though a little thick and cheaper meat in terms of the chicken.  Entrees were a little slow to come out but not bad for a Friday night when the place was packed.  I had left it up to the waitress as to my personal order as she seemed quite knowledgeable.  Just wanted 'light and spicy.'  I eat everything so not a tall order.  Others in the group were easy as well and ordered a few specials off the menu.  My entree was an incredibly oily dish with minimal spice and some 'light' lettuce pieces on the side. Very cheap cuts of chicken, relying on oil and grease for flavor.  Everyone else also got an oily basic Americanized perversion of Thai food as well.  Totally basic and without any sort of creativity.  If you like the subpar stuff they serve at PF Chang's you won't be disappointed.  If you have ever been to a solid True Thai restaurant anywhere else in the country that isn't chain-affiliated, stay home.  I have sent maybe 5 plates back in my adult life.  I sent this back and the waitress just took it and walked off.  No 'hey would you like something else' or 'perhaps I can get the chef to come out and recommend another dish?' Nothing.  Just left and took it off the bill.  Phoenicians we need to demand better.  Our restaurants are just abysmal in terms of food in comparison to every major metropolitan area of comparable size.  If you have lived in or visited any of these areas you know what I mean. Love Phx but this is just another hyped up average girl next door.",

The negative changes are that the portion sizes are smaller and that the waitstaff is a little pushy sometimes. Neither of these things is overwhelmingly awful, but I wish they hadn't gone this direction. When I first started going here about 6 years ago each entree could easily feed 3 or 4 people if you ordered a couple of dishes and went family style. Now they feed maybe 2. It's obviously not a huge change but one that I've seen happen at other places when the begin to slip. Now for the positives. Their dishes used to be very mellow as far as spices went and they have definitely kicked the spice up a bit which I love ,not that you can't get it mellow anymore they just have more spice options. and They had some really tasty drinks both alcoholic and non. Overall I still love this place and will continue to come back.",

It's location in Old Town sets the ambiance for a perfect date night.    We have our staples when it comes to Thai food which we always split. The Pad Thai for him with tons of protein and the Panang Curry for me with tons of Vegetables, both ordered spicy.  This is the second time we went and will be back again.      I was compelled to write this because it was THE BEST Chicken Panang curry I have ever tasted. It had a smooth tomato base that you could only taste a hint of the tomato it was absolutely creamy, divine, and flavorful. I was going to have to poke his hand if he kept taking it because I wanted it all for myself.  So good that I told the waitress that she had to tell the chef compliments. It opened up my husbands stuffy nose, but the spice was not so strong you couldn't taste the delicious flavors.  If you have ever been turned off by a yellow curry and said curry is not for me, Please give this dish a try. Again, the best I have ever eaten in 3 states that I have lived in.    Unfortunately we are not impressed with the Pad Thai.  The only way we can describe it is that somehow they Americanized it.  Not very flavorful and the noodles always are stuck together. If you put your fork in it, it will lift the whole plate almost.  We had to order bean sprouts which usually come with a pad Thai and felt like it was missing the peanuts or eggs or both. Next time, we are going to try the Drunken Noodles, and I can't wait to!    I give 2 thumbs up even though the pad Thai wasn't the best, overall the service was great, and so was the food.  Thank you Malee's for your existence and keep up the good work! Love, love, love!",

Pretty, romantic and comfortable. We were sat outside in this private little area the first night we went there. It was so lovely! We were way in the back, on the patio outside, almost hidden from everyone else. My first thought was that we might end up being neglected by the staff, but nothing could have been further from the truth. They were very attentive. There's always someone coming to your table, filling your water glass, clearing plates, asking if you need anything.  The food was so good! I had a crispy mango fish dish that had so much flavor! They even offer brown rice if you want it. They offer about 6 levels of spiciness. We had a couple of sticky rice desserts, one mango and the other, custard with black sticky rice--really good. We enjoyed it so much that we drove back to Scottsdale this past weekend and had another awesome meal there. There are so many places to get Thai food, but this restaurant is one of the best I've dined in.",

    "text": "I was a little disappointed with my meal at Malee's. I had lunch with some friends; we had the Thai sampler appetizer, which was large and had several different tasty items.  I ordered the panang curry with tofu, but I ended up being served chicken. I'm fine with eating chicken; I was just in the mood for tofu that day but didn't say anything to our waiter because it didn't really bother me one way or another. However, I think it was a little careless on his part because you never know who has dietary restrictions.  The pad thai was a little disappointing. I didn't care for the sauce (texture or taste). The salad that came with lunch had peanut sauce, but I thought it was a little heavy for the lettuce. The ginger chicken soup was good.  Prices were fair, as were portion sizes. The restaurant itself is very pretty with a nice location, but I don't think I would go back. It just wasn't a style of Thai food that I personally care for. Perhaps the other menu items are better.",

    "text": "I was really, really disappointed with this place. I LOVE Thai food, I would eat it every night if I could. I've been trying every Thai joint within 20 miles of my new abode, trying to find something comparable to the authentic Thai I got in Anthem (of all places). Malees was the worst strike-out of them all.  My first clue should have been when the girl asked \"How spicy?\"  I replied with \"3\", as every Thai restaurant I've been to does a scale of 1 to 5.  She responded with an awkward silence and then \"... So really hot?\"   No... no... just no.   We had the appetizer platter, which was 6 different things that all tasted the same, save for the crab rangoons, the crispy pla and the evil jungle princess. The fish candy was blah. The crispy pla, as someone already mentioned in another review, tasted like nothing whatsoever, and the sauce was overly sweet; I thought I'd need an insulin shot after 2 bites. The evil jungle princess is one of my favorite dishes, but this one was just not right. It was like they had dumped chili powder into it. Chili powder does not go in Thai food. Do not want. It did NOT mix in with the curry and just burned the s*** out of my tongue. The rice was also very dry.  The bill for this \"Oh let's just get Thai takeout\" evening came out to $49. $49 for freaking take-out for 2 people. I was kind of shell-shocked; I had added it up at home and it shouldn't have been that much.... but me not wanting to cause a scene, I just paid it. I don't know if they accidentally did \"large\" portions, but they looked normal sized to me.  But Jesus Christ, I can pay $25 for two people and get amaaaazing Thai food, so $49 for this lame excuse for Thai was not acceptable. Yes, I realize this is Scottsdale, and I am used to paying more for everything, but this was a whole new level... Especially knowing there is more authentic, less pricey Thai food about 3 miles south of here.",

We tried Malee's for dinner. Both my friend and I loved the ambience, the waiter was great, patient, and helpful. However neither of us liked our choice of entrees. We both agreed that the food had definitely been prepared well, portions were large & presentation was good. He ordered a seafood entree prepared with curry, and I ordered a chicken with some peanut sauce which I now know i do not care for. We both agreed to try again with something else. Soon",

The two of us arrived at 8:20, approximately 40 minutes before they closed, and the waiter was very friendly. He came over filled our drinks and gave us time to figure out what we needed to order, but after that we only ever saw him when he brought our food and finally brought us our bill 20 minutes after we were finished. Not once did he see how our meal was, refill our water, or see if we'd like another glass of wine. Right before he brought our bill, we also showed him the \"25% off between the hours of 8 PM and 9 PM, Monday through Friday\" deal on their Yelp page. A few minutes later, the manager came by to tell us that the coupon was not valid, that it'd expired 5 months prior, and that it wasn't his fault that the coupon was still up. His demeanor was fairly rude and the fact that he said it's Yelp's fault and not the restaurant's for not managing their own account properly really rubbed me the wrong way. After telling us he could only give us 10% off, the waiter let us know he ended up being able to give us the full 25%, however, it obviously seemed like a burden for them to have done it. I had stopped in Scottsdale for only a few hours to just have dinner with my friend, and I was very disappointed with our experience. Will I return to restaurant? Maybe during lunch time when there's more customers and different wait staff, but I'll never go out of my way to eat here again, and especially not for a two hour visit. I expect more from a restaurant located in such a prime location.",

If you want to disfigure your body by covering it in tattoos that is your business but you should cover them up at work so you don't disgust your customers by shoving them in their faces.

It has more of a contemporary Thai-American fusion atmosphere.   The price is a bit hefty for a Thai restaurant.  It reminds me of PF Chang for Chinese food.  We had the soft shell crab for the appetizer and the duck curry and the coco chili fish for the main course.  The soft shell crab is made from a whole soft shell crab including the shell attached and tempera battered which made the crab very crunchy.  Every part of the crab was edible.  The mixture of the crunchy tempera batter and the sweet tangy cucumber mae ploy sauce was delectable.  The duck from the duck curry dish was so tender that it tasted like butter. The red curry had pineapple in it. I ordered a 4 for the duck curry, but it wasn't as spicy as some of the other Thai places were.  So if you like HOT food, then be sure to ask for 5+.  The coco chili fish is a battered white fish deep fried covered in a peanut sauce.  It was one of their signature dishes.  I enjoyed the flavoring of the fish.  The batter absorbed the sauce very well that created a unique combination.  It went quite well together.    I recommend this place with a love for Thai food and an openness to trying new things.",

I was there for happy hour and ordered the 2 appetizers recommended by the waiter. While the portion size was ample, you likely won't be interested in having it wrapped up to go. The summer rolls were basically a large roll of rice noodles--very little veggies or meat at all. In fact maybe just two tiny morsels. The sauces were tasty, but couldn't get enough of them to overcome the dry wads of rice noodles. The crab rangoons were nothing special. In fact, I was left with a sort of funky-fishy flavor, and I'm half expecting to be sick in the next hour. There are so many good restaurants in this area. Don't waste your time with this one.",

After several days of eating Italian and American food, we decided to go \"Asian\" and chose Malee's based on the high average Yelp rating.  My first impression was good.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the service is pretty good.  But I was shocked when I saw the menu.   The prices are outrageous.  It ended up costing $62 for 3 people.  I'm pretty sure I could've gotten the same amount of food for half the price at any Thai restaurant in LA.  We ordered Crab Rangoon, Tom Ga Kai soup, Calamari salad, and Roasted Duck Curry.  The Crab Rangoon lacked crab and the sauce did not go well with the fried dumpling.  One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant defaults to white meat chicken without asking me for my opinion. News Flash! There are many of us out there who prefer the juiciness and tenderness of dark meat chicken.  Anyway, the Tom Ga Kai had all white meat chicken and it tasted dry and flavorless. Furthermore, the soup was too thick and was more like a stew.  The soup base itself was far too sweet.  I order this soup at every Thai restaurant I go to so I think I've had it enough times to be able to say that this one was the worst.   I am also a huge fan of Roasted Duck Curry and this was the worst Roasted Duck Curry I've had at a Thai restaurant anywhere.  Even though this was not a good Roasted Duck Curry, we all agreed that it was the best thing we ordered.  How sad.",

The bar area was a little busy with servers coming and going for drinks but we didn't mind.  It was still quiet enough for conversation.  The food was excellent just like our previous visit.  We loved the basil chicken!  I can't say how great the service from the bar tender was.  Although he clearly was busy he was extremely attentive to us.  We never had to wait for anything.  When he boxed up our leftovers he gave us extra rice to take home.  When we were driving away we saw him running out to us with my purse in hand trying to catch us.  Now THAT is service.  I hadn't realized I left it there!  It is pretty rare that a busy bar tender would stop what he was doing to run your purse outside to catch you.  Seriously we will be back and leave him an even better tip next time!",

The one time I ordered something and it came out weird for me, the manager actually took care of me personally and that meant alot to me. On Valentine's Day we went to Malee's and we actually got to talk to the lady who owns Malee's so that was super cool.   Ok so if your into fish, or even if your not LOL The Pla platter is AMAZING!!! I would recomend this to anyone. Also the Chicken Satay is the best around. And as I said above if you like Pad Thai this is the only place to get it :)  The deserts here are wonderful too. The last couple times we have gone they have had the mango and jackfruit cheese cake. Basically little cheesecake tarts in a wonton wrapper topped with mango and jackfruit. Very delish!!!   I would and do recomend this place to anyone looking for great Thai food. I will be a customer of Malee's for a very long time.  Also the atmospere is really laid back. I have went there in a dress and heels, and I have also gone in jean shorts and flip flops LOL",

    "text": "Definitely the best Thai place in Old Town. Always good service, never a wait, was quick for take out too. My favorite thing is the chicken panang and my boyfriend likes the yellow curry. We tried the Siamese kisses last time too and those were great. Everyone always seems to be ordering those giant pots of soup so that's on my list to try next time. Huge portions so you'll have leftovers or you can share. They also had a deal last summer for like $3 vodka drinks which is a steal. It isn't that cheap but it's worth it. I wish they delivered.",

    "text": "UPDATE: 12/5/14 The owner contacted me after I posted this review and apologized. She offered a gift certificate to make up for the lack of service. It's been three months, and no gift certificate ever was sent to me. Pity...she seemed willing to try and make it up to us, but never followed through.   Came here a couple of weeks ago. My boyfriend and I were seated at a table that had a half-full glass of wine left on it. When we mentioned it, the hostess looked confused, but took it away. We were given waters by the water boys who were completely on top of refilling glasses. But we never had a waiter come by to take an order. We tried waving one over, making eye contact, anything- and we were completely ignored. We even went up to the hostess stand and asked if someone could come take our order after about 10 minutes of this. No one showed up. Granted, they were busy- but the restaurant was only half full. People who were seated after us were helped.  We gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left. When we told the hostess why we were leaving she just said \"Oh, OK.\" No apology, nothing.  I guess we found out why there was a glass of wine left on the table. Someone else probably walked out before us because they were never served!  We used to come here once every couple of months... now, I seriously doubt we will come here again. Pity, because the food and the menu really is good- I would have given it 5 stars. And in the past the service was good too- at least 3-4 stars.",

($9.99 for curry where other places will charge $7.99 or cheaper). My party of 3 had the Arizona style curry, Panang Curry, and Pad Thai.   The good: -Panang curry -Flavorful dishes -Great service -Nice ambiance (totally watched couples on first dates here) -Nice pillows on couches  The bad: -The rice was dry, thin, and not the kind that goes well with curry. I prefer rice that's moist, fluffy, and similar to Calrose rice. -The Pad Thai was dry. I recall my friend saying: \"I just want to pour water over the noodles, it's that dry.\" -The method they use to increase spiciness. I want to say it was as if they placed a lot of black ground peppers instead of authentic peppers incorporated into the dish.",

My favorite meals are the crispy basil chicken, the pad thai and the peanut curry with chicken.(it syas pork on the menu but just ask for the chicken) The spicy cashew beef is also delicious. They get pretty crowded on art walk night, but you can usually get in without much trouble.They also have great martini's. This is a must try if you are visiting Scottsdale.",

Came here with the family and it was good but very hot, even when we asked for things to not be that spicy as some at the table couldn't handle it. For example the thai hot wings we ordered but asked for low spice...they had me burning up and required a trip to the restroom to take care of the sweat. I regularly complain that hot wings most places aren't spicy enough and order suicide wings a decent amount if that gives you any idea of how hot these had to be.  The seafood curry was great as was the whole fish that was lightly battered with mango salsa (i think halibut), both were great. The panang was also very good but again packed some serious heat.  Overall it's good but I would say a bit over priced and some of the heat of the dishes takes away from the flavor. Probably need to give it a second chance for a full evaluation but call it 3-3.5 stars for now.",

The class is held on a Staurday. When Chris called to confirm our reservation he made sure to let us know that a cab my be needed to take us home...sounds good to me. The classroom is small seating about 20 people at the most. There were mimosas waiting for us.  The class started with introductions to the variuos Thai cooking ingredients. I found this information so interesting. How do you know which fish sauce to buy, what the different pastes smell and taste like, how to grow your own Lemongrass and so much more.  We started by making Siamese Kisses. It was all hands on and really fun. The next was a fresh red curry paste. Then we compared the fresh to the store bought brand. What a difference! The Arizona Heatwave was next. So Delish. The final dish was Asian Pumpkin Custard. We tasted everything along the way and then they served us HUGE portions of the items for lunch with a Champange paring. The Chamange paring was also very informative and the pours were never ending. He was right about having a DD lined up... The staff really cares about the food they produce and will make any dietary adjustments you may need.  I really had a great time.",

I also had some of the Yellow Curry with brown rice, and it was packed with flavor and would have been a much better option for me to order.    Overall, the food was good and the service was peachy.  I would probably visit this place again.",

Not the best Thai I've ever had by far:  Pad Thai was loaded with chicken and shrimp which is a plus+, but what is with that red color in all their food? I've been in Thailand, ate lots of Pad Thai there and never once had anything that was red in color...hmmm..go figure?  It was spiced way too much to be authentic Thai having been there but it was ok. Had the Thai Basil Margharita which was really refreshing for Summer.  Worth drinking again...and maybe another again. Loaded with business on Saturday night, great service...food just ok.  Would I hit it up again?  If I were in the area maybe but  never would I make a special trip to eat this style of Thai.  Just not my style at all.",

The seafood itself was excellent (and at their prices, it should be!) and they cooked the rice properly (more hard to find in AZ than you'd believe!), but the curry itself was a disaster. It was very thin and watery and reflected pure cayenne rather than curry spices (e.g., chili, cumin, coriander, turmeric). When I eat red curry in Thai Basil restaurants around the valley, that red curry gravy is so delectable, I drink it down to the last drop, but not here. Crazy how Mexican influences tend to corrupt the kitchens of other cuisines in this state. I had Linguini with clam sauce in a so-called Italian restaurant here where they ruined the sauce in the same way! Wait staff here gets high marks, though. Young but very professional, personable and attentive.",

We ordered the appetizer sampler, which was an assortment of \"Asian\" type finger foods, all done wrong w/ the wrong dipping sauces.  Drunken Noodles, which came out as thin noodles in a creamy noodles, instead of wide noodles w/ a spicy sauce.    Crispy-Pla.  So sweet, it was not edible.  Duck Curry.  Really dry duck and didn't have any curry flavor to it at all.  Jasmine Rice was more like Uncle Ben's rice.  It looked like they served us someone else's used rice too, by the way the rice looked inside.    Disgusting.  I told the waiter and he said it was American food, not really Thai food.  Oh, and their claims that thay make their noodles fresh is a joke.  Let me go in the kitchen to check that out, because no way, no how are their noodles fresh.  If you're Asian, don't come here.  You'll be greatly greatly disappointed.    I'm so disappointed I wasted a meal in Scottsdale at such a poor excuse for a Thai Retaurant.    I should have known when I walked in and nobody in the restaurant, servers, hostess, guest were Asian.",

I can finish the whole serving and be filled with the warm deliciousness of panang. Also, their peanut sauce served on the salad that comes with the lunch special is the greatest in town. Just give me a bucket of their panang and peanut sauce and I'll be set...for a week! For appetizers, the Siamese kisses and tempura veggies are great. Cute decor and atmosphere, too!

Additionally, the salad came topped with \"chicken\". Normally when we order salad the chicken comes in either a breast or strips but this chicken looked ground up and pre-chewed. Definitely would not recommend this dish. On a positive note the calimari in my salad was cooked perfectly (not greasy or oily) but the rest of the dish failed to come together (the flavor profiles were not to my tastes). The place itself looks amazing on the inside and the service was extremely good. I would give it one more shot and order a curry dish here to try out some of the restaurant's strengths.",

He said I can't use it for takeout and said he has the documents \"to prove it\" from Groupon.  Very defensive in front of customers in the restaurant! I drove 20 miles to get there and checked on the Groupon website and it said nothing about not for takeout. The server said the only way I can get the food is to pay full price. I said I want to use the Groupon and he could not care less. I also asked \"is this what customer service is all about\"? And \"what is the difference between takeout and sitting in the restaurant\"? He said with takeout you won't spend extra on your tab. After this heated discussion in the lobby, he said he did not care and he grabbed the bag of food and steamed to the back room. Now I'm out my original $20 I spent with Groupon, drove 40 miles, and had a very embarrassing experience in front of other patrons. I'm not so concerned about the money, but what terrible customer service for a potential new cutomer. I also used the \"contact owner\" e- mail on Malee's website to provide feedback about this. I never got a response for them. Guess this was no surprise if this is the way they want to treat their customers.",

Everyone was in Scottsdale at the same time so the 6 of us decided to eat at Malee's since we all love Thai food. I can't talk for everyone except for my husband and I. When we sat down we asked for lemons for our water and didn't get them until the apps were served. The restaurant wasn't full so I don't get it.. But we did get them at some point, which is better than not getting at all. We ordered the rice paper veg rolls as an app... and the sauces were OK but the roll was way too full we had to use a knife and fork, it wasn't too bad, mediocre is the way I would describe it... Then we had the Arizona Heat Curry (hot) and the Hippy Noodles... The curry was hot but had no taste, you saw that it didn't have much coconut milk mainly spice and nothing else.. The hippy noodles were dry and tasteless with only broccoli, smoked tofu and egg...  We all ordered the mango jack cheesecake and since it was recommended by the server we took two to share.. It was HORRIBLE... cold, old, dry, it didn't taste  like any cheesecake I ever had..... when we complained he looked at us like a deer in the headlights, and did nothing for us just cleared the table.. The bill was way too high for such mediocre food. With no compensation for the Cheesecake....We will not be going back anytime soon.. .what a shame....",

Some of the other standouts I've had at Malee's include Arizona Heat Wave, which is spicy but not unbearably so. Tender chicken with a red curry base, coconut milk and traditional spices. So rich you will even want to eat it for dessert.  I also loved the Satay. This past Autumn there was a wonderful pumpkin custard for dessert. I was fortunate to take one of their recent cooking classes, taught by their menu designer (who is from Thailand if I recall correctly) and the owner herself. To my delight, I was able to replicate the delicious Arizona Heat Wave at home. But I still plan to keep going back to Malee's whenever possible. Not just for the food; Malee's atmosphere is warm and comfortable with fun exotic touches, and some of the friendliest staff. A great place for people watching, too, both inside and afterwards, while strolling through the art district.",

Only negative I have is the host station was kinda a mess, several hostesses but they didn't seem to be working well together. They had forgotten to cross off people already sat and were confused on who was next.. lol I'd upgrade to a software system they could drag and drop parties vs scribble on paper with sharpie. And have ONE person doing it and others escorting the patrons to their table.",

Deidre, the owner, has always gone out of her way to  make sure we had a wonderful experience. I'm not a Thai snob, nor know a great deal about \"authentic\" Thai food, but everything I've ever eaten here was absolutely mouthwatering and unique.  I now live in New Orleans, but have friends back in Scottsdale who still bring out of town guests to Malee's, and the favorable reports keep coming!     My all time **favorite** treat at Malee's are the \"Thai Sticks!\"  Succulent, huge, jumbo shrimp wrapped and fried in noodles.  Apparently, they have taken them off of the menu years ago,  but brought them back, \"limited edition\" style.  Catch them early in the day!  Apparently they are a bit complicated to make and must be prepared the night before.  Ask for them to keep them popular!",

Tons of places have come and gone in this area, but Malee's has been around awhile.  I've been here more than a few times, but it's only been for lunch. I'm not sure how the lunch menu differs from the dinner (I'm guessing slightly different portions & prices...and maybe a few different options?), but you get quite a bit of food for a reasonable price during lunch, and most meals come w/the a side salad or soup. I've always just got a salad. It's pretty basic, but it comes w/a peanut dressing that's pretty tasty.  I'm pretty sure I've had some of the noodle dishes in the past (for sure the pad thai), but lately  I've been getting curry. The panang is really good, but my favorite is the Arizona Heatwave. It's a red curry, with a bit of a kick and it's delicious!   It's never been all that crowded when I've came for lunch, but the service has always been attentive & friendly. One of these days I need to come here for dinner.",

Was offered tasters of their beers on tap - which was a nice option! +1 point.. Drinks same pretty quickly after ordering and the wait staff gave us ample time to review the menu. We ate Thai almost every week back home in Australia and this was the first Thai restaurant we have been too since moving to Scottsdale.  Appetizer was lovely - great choices and very fresh - it was the Taste of Thai Pupu Platter. For mains, we had Tom Ka Gai soup with chicken, which was lovely, great flavours. as well as the Massaman curry ribs which were very tasty, but a little fatty (and chewy) and the potatoes were underdone.  We will definitely go back to try out the other dishes they have on the menu..",

    "text": "I have given this place numerous chances and every time is just an okay experience. I have done both takeout and dine in and both experiences were pretty much the same.   Dine in- be prepared to wait.  Even if you are seated right away, the service always seems to be slow. Even if the restaurant is slow, they seem to be running behind. I would give service 2 stars overall for every time I have eaten there.  Once they finally get to your table to take your order the food comes relatively quickly, but the time to place your order is what takes forever. The food I would give 4 stars.  I've order the seafood curry, the pad Thai, the glass noodles, and quite a few others.  Everything is pretty good, but is not like other Thai restaurants. The pad Thai is good but when I ordered it for the first time it wasn't what I was expecting.    Take out- I have ordered takeout a few times now and they never seem to have the food ready when they say.  It's either way faster than they quote so when you get there it's cold by the time you get home or it's not ready and you end up waiting.  The other experience that upset me was one day I was paying by credit card and the woman tried 2 different cards and told me they weren't working (they worked everywhere else and at another place later that night).   This is fine but she was a little rude when it wouldn't work like there was something I could do about it. Whatever was wrong must have been on their machine.   Overall the food is good, but maybe not the Thai food you are expecting.  If you are in a hurry this is not the place for you.  Service is slow so expect that when going in and you will be fine.",

Everyone is very accommodating and the wait staff is knowledgeable and really kind.   However, there's one specific thing that has bothered me, the pad thai here is not as good as it could be. I LOVE pad thai, and I've had some really delicious authentic Pad Thai in Thailand and I've also had some really delicious cheap pad thai from some divey crappy to-go only places that were still very yummy.  The pad thai here is a little bit bland and a little soggy almost like it wasn't made in a super hot wok but was cooked over slow heat with a lot more liquid than I've ever had before. I've ordered it a few times, as I don't like to judge restaurants on potential one-off situations. I order it as \"hot\" every time and I've gotten some really different results, along with inconsistent amounts of peanuts (I mean not a big deal in the grand scheme of things)   With that being said, everything else is great. I've had their curry and it was good. The ambiance of the place is very cute and cozy. The patio is really cute and faces out to the Old Town Area. I've seen some comments here about prices... I don't think other yelpers consider the fact that they are eating in the middle of Old Town. The prices are on par with the area, and you're getting what you're paying for! Great service in a pricey part of town.",

Siamese kisses were my favorite they were served with 3 types of sauces and are the perfect appetizer.

We got what is Malee's version of an appetizer sampler and there wasn't a single thing on that plate that would get less than 5 stars in my book. Not to mention, the server was totally cute and sweet and made good conversation with us. I will say, I am not an expert in spicy food and consider myself more of a child in terms of heat. I thought I ordered what was their medium and mouth was easily on fire, I definitely didn't hate it though!! One of my new faves :)",

The prices on the menu are such that one doesn't need to be wealthy to enjoy the richness of Malee's, but it could end up being for special occasions.  Consistent quality in food, overshadows occasional quirks in service.  Worth driving across the valley for.    Thai restaurants have become jewels in the mainstream culinary landscape; with Pad Thai noodles leading the march.  Even restaurants toting different monikers may offer this gateway dish of Thai cuisine.  Straight outta the kitchen, or with hot coffee the next morning; Malee's has the best I've tasted.  Years ago existed a sister location at Desert Ridge; the epicenter for these exotic savors is in Old Town Scottsdale.  Dress it up, or dress it down, the casual dining location won't disappoint whether you linger with the locals or dive in to take out.  They do offer reservations; recommended for peak chow times.  To keep the extraneous romantic and exciting, try the Evil Jungle Princess.  Without a bon vivant of the Thai palette available, this aficionado of flavor recognizes the poetic grasp on their dishes.",

While we both have had Thai food before, we are not experts in this cuisine. Our lovely waitress Bo walked us through the menu and made several exceptional recommendations-all of which we went with. We tried the Chicken Satay, Tom Ka Gai (their famous coconut ginger soup), Crispy Mango fish, and spicy Green Basil Curry.   Everything we tried was infused with so much amazing flavor, there wasn't anything we didn't like. Bo's knowledge of the menu and recommendation on the level of spice for each dish was spot-on. We wished that we had room for dessert. Needless to say, we are planning our next visit.",

I was hesitant but the reviews were amazing and pictures looked great. The pictures don't do this place justice. These were the largest portions of food I've ever received at a Thai restaurant. Fresh quality, authentic flavors, and great service pretty much sum this place up.

All 3 times I have ordered hot, and the hotness of the flavor was the opposite of hot.  I agree with the other reviewers, the food is very bland, and nothing like Thai Chili, Takeda Thai, Thai house, Thai Patio, Thai Elephant.  So either all of those places make their food wrong and with explosive flavor and spice or Malee's food just is a very watered down version.   I understand different levels of hot, but if hot is the second to the highest, there should be a little heat!  Not only that I taste no fish sauce, no freshness from the basil, nothing and the noodles I had tasted like they came out of a ramen packet.    Malees has solid service, and the food I guess is good for someone looking for bland, but definitely not Thai food.  I'm bummed.",

Three tiny shrimp, not even measuring an inch in diameter, along with rings of Calamari so minuscule they resembled small rubber bands. Not kidding. Why, half the fun of eating calamari is grossing your friends out by hanging all the tentacles halfway out of your mouth - then sucking them back in - in a mighty swoosh.  Major disappointment, no swooshing.  Malee's.  If you think your fabulous sauces are going to wow me, getting me to overlook how  you just cheated me out of fifteen bucks, you're wrong.   I don't like gnawing on lemongrass sticks either. Leave them out. They do nothing for the presentation, save for tricking your average Thai food novice into taking a bite.  This would be like an American restaurant leaving bay leaves in everything and having Thai people thinking its something you eat.  Shame on you.   I didn't like the Spinach Chicken either. Same chicken base and sauce as is in many of the other chicken dishes, only it's ladled over fresh, uncooked spinach leaves.  You couldn't have put less effort into this dish if you tried.  This is the Vanna White of Thai dishes.  Maybe this is how you survive the summer months when the tourists are gone.  I'm out.",

She came out, apologized and gave us a bottle of wine on the house, while assigning the excellent and observant waitress to our table of five.

The Better Half had a craving for Thai Coffee and I used the handy dandy Yelp App to find the nearest Thai restaurant....this was only 1 block away!  I called them and asked if they served Thai Coffee to go.  Once they confirmed that they did, we were on our way.  The Thai Coffee was OK, not the best we've ever had, but average.  It looks like a cool place to have a meal, so we'll be back another time to give it a try.  Return Factor - 60%",

The music was lovely and not intrusive. The food was delectable and served by a charming young lady who truly knows her craft and made us comfortable from the time we walked in. When in Old Scottsdale, give this place a try.",

    "text": "I was introduced to Malee's many years ago and impressed on the first visit by trying the Crispy Basil Chicken; the dish offers a unique take on an asian fusion \"red chicken\" classic with a tangy and subtle sauce.  I have since expanded to trying many items on the menu and have continued to be impressed.  For those that enjoy seafood the Crispy Mango Fish is awesome; the sauce is sweet and spicy, making the dish a real treat.  Bottom Line: Malee's is an excellent find, offering an upscale environment in old town at a reasonable price.  The interesting menu doesn't miss a beat and offers something new to please the palate every time (if you can get away from a few mainstays).  The professional service also adds that extra touch, which is necessary to make it a solid 5 star.",

    "text": "Thai skeptics and Thai lovers unite! Malee's hits the mark with classic Thai flavors punched up in artful, unique dishes. It is consistently one of my favorite restaurants in the Old Town area, and is reasonably priced for the quality to boot!   I love spice, and the Thai Fai Fire Wraps (crispy chicken lettuce wraps spiced to your request) are as satisfying as they are fun to eat. As another appetizer, you can't go wrong with a pot of Tom Yum, the perfect blend of tangy and hot soup with generous helpings of mushroom and chicken.  For an entree, I almost always order the Arizona Heatwave which is a vegetarian red curry delight with veggies cooked to perfection in a savory, creamy sauce. The Pad Thai noodles are another favorite -- and I appreciate that the crushed peanut sauce comes on the side, so you can add as much as you want.  Whatever you do, GET THE FRIED RICE!!! (more specifically, Deirdre's Favorite Jalapeno Fried Rice). Quite possibly one of the most simple, yet delicious things I have ever tasted. The dish includes flavorful fried rice mixed with crisp jalapenos and Chinese sausage which is to-die-for.  No bad words about Malee's. I go home happy every time.",

That was definitely a good choice :)  Pros- - Lots of options on the menu, and they are clearly explained so there is minimal confusion - Every dish has the option to be changed (perfect for picky eaters like myself!) - Generous portion sizes - Fair prices, nothing was over $20 - The staff was very personable! Such nice people who love what they do! - Efficient service  Cons- - I ordered a side of noodles and never got them :(  But above all else DON'T FORGET TO: TRY THEIR NEW SPRING ROLLS BTW. I forgot the name, but it's the Chicken ones on their latest menu. SOOOO good!",

I thought to make reservations, which was a good idea because it was very packed on a Friday night. We started with the taste of thai, which is their version of a pupu platter. My favorites were the thai toast and chicken satay. It was a little weird that the fried items were hot, but the pot stickers and siamese kisses were a little warm, but still good. I had the crispy basil chicken (level 3 hot) and Jon had the shrimp stirfry (level 1 hot). When our dishes were brought out, we both loved the flavors, but agreed we needed some more heat, and our server gladly brought out some chili paste for us which did the job.   It's a very cute restaurant and I'll definitely be back to try some other things on the menu.",

    "text": "Malee's please come to CA! I know there's Thai on every corner here but I have to say your place is the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD!  As a young teen I remember my first time coming here. Maybe we shouldn't say how long ago that was but... (cough cough probably 20 years ago) a long time ago. Let me say since I was two I've eaten sushi and had always loved food... So coming here I had a surprise... I didn't care for it. I turned my nose up at it and told my aunt I wasn't hungry. Couple years go by tho and I have to mention I went back and to my surprise I fell in LOVE WITH THE TOM YUM SOUP! I mean I asked for seconds and maybe turned the bowl upside down so savor every last drop.  As I look back I realize I must have been in one of those terrible teenage moods. Surprising I know but I was from Texas and I am pretty sure I saw it and thought...veggies and that smell?? I'm not gonna like that. Ugh! Here I could have been enjoying Malee's for two years prior and my teen bratty side took over.  Now I must tell everyone this is my favorite restaurant ever! For every special occasion I prefer Malee's over Flemming's, Mastros, Ruth's and even after opening out precious Roy's of Scottsdale (I know it's gone from Scottsdale..sad) I prefer it over all.  We always have the same but when we take guest I enjoy seeing of anyone else will want to try something new I haven't tried.  I order off the old menu since I'm \"ancient\" and the new menu confuses me. I remember the old menu had so many items tho that I'm sure it makes things much easier to have slimmed down the deliciousness to the best.  First we have the Summer Rolls served with plum sauce and peanut sauce and I always ask for some siraca since I like it spicy. They are such a treat since AZ is so hot in the summer and it's served cool. In other words this is a fresh summer roll and not \"fried\" so please don't get confused ..it's not a spring roll. It's has ingredients such as fresh basil and I believe you can do chicken or shrimp ..or both? Idk.. All I know is they're BOMB and my mouth is watering so ....in to the second course.  Next is my favorite dish and I confess I have come to get this item as takeout  TOO MANY TIMES TO COUNT!!!! It's amazing and still to this day THE BEST SOUP I HAVE EVER...EVER HAD!!!  Tom Yum soup seafood combination is simply to dies for! Oh Deirdre  Sweet beautiful Deirdre  one day please open up in Ca! You would make so many people sooooo happy!! I just can't tell you how amazing this soup is...you will need to try it yourself! AND WHEN YOU DO... You will thank me a million times over (by buying me some Tom Yum) . One thing I have to say is I do sometimes take out the squid (my aunt doesn't like the texture..but I say hand it over... And the root that looks like wood haha... Yeh... Don't eat that. It's so flavorful that I'm sure that and the cilantro and fresh lemongrass are some of the fine ingredients that being this dish to my all time faves. Seriously! You will crave this soup and pick it up just by its self for dinner!!  For the main dishes we usually keep it family style and have what use to be called the \"00\" (double zero), now referred to as the Arizona Heatwave. It's a delicious ed curry that is simply the only red curry that I ever order. Here in Cali I have to stick to the yellow curry. Her red curry is such an amazing distinct flavor of richness that it's just incomparable to others. I don't know what she does but I've tried it everywhere along with the soup and nah.... Never ever the same. I do order this dish without coconut milk. Still want brothy creamy texture but the coconut milk for me is a nah. It's served with all sorts of veggies from carrots, broccoli to baby corn and celery. Oh man this review...can you tell I'm in love with this place? Ok so quickly I'll tell ya the other couple entrees we have when in a group is the Pad Thai noodles (yumm) and the Crispy Pla White Fish... (Double Yumm). Both are just delectable dishes that beat other Thai restaurants by a mile shot!  Now that I have mentioned the food ui know you want to go... Now I must tell you to make a reservation please. The front desk staff is always sweet and I believe his name is Jon? Just a breath of fresh air this handsome devil. So sweet and even tho it seems I have seen him over half my life we probably have never spoken more than a couple words. Hope he knows he is a gem to the restaurant. I mean I always look for him and of course beautiful Deirdre. You can't miss her. She's the gorgeous blond whoa presence demands your attention when walking through the room. (If course when I'm with my gorgeous aunt Diane Dillard...you can't miss that beauty two). Woah.. Those two in the same room... Watch out Scottsdale!   I have to mention one last thing that is always such a treat and so unique.. When served the check you receive a cool treat of white chocolate served in what I imagine as a type of husk from maybe corn or bamboo? Just a GEM this place!",

    "text": "It doesn't look like they sell authentic thai food when you see the menu and all the diversity amongst the workers but trust me looks can be deceiving. We were ready to leave when we looked at the menu and didn't find a section with all the different curry dishes grouped together (green, red, panang, ect) but after asking a worker who was probably the manager if they sold real thai food, I was told yes they do and asked what I was looking for. I asked for panang or red curry tofu and was shown on the menu where they were or what dish they could be made from replacing the chicken with tofu. Some of the curry dishes had unique names so the worker pointing them out really helped and kept me at the restaurant. I ended up getting the yellow curry tofu which isn't on the menu but any meat can be replaced with anything. The menu said the yellow curry was the mildest of the curries. I like hot thai food so I asked our server if the dish could be made with a 3.5 on a spicyness scale that goes up to 5. The food was amazing. My only complaint is the potatoes were a little too hard. The service was quick and the water was refilled constantly by a bunch of different water boys. I'm glad I ended up staying. This my new go to thai place. I will be coming here often. I got the large yellow curry tofu and ended up paying about $16 with the tax included. I was full and satisfied when I left. The hard potatoes almost took a star off but I'll let it slide this time, if it's hard again next time I'll change my rating. I dug the vibe and atmosphere. Great thai restaurant.",

Siamese kisses were ok not terrible, bland, would never get them again. The chicken wings were unique- not my thing, way to much sauce - very sweet. The salad was horrible. Horrible.

Boy am I glad we did.  The yellow curry that I ordered was awesome. Large portion, flavorful curry, nothing was overcooked. It was great. I think we also got the calamari as an appetizer and I think it was decent. My memory has been overwritten by the awesomeness of the curry.   The service was a little wonky. Our server/bartender (Ooi?) was excellent. Great at upselling, knowledgeable, friendly, she was great. She made our experience 100x better even without the great food.   The bus/water boy was not so great. I think our server refilled our glasses more than he did, and when he did not it was sloppy and rough. We asked for one or two things from him and never received them.   All in all a wonderful experience and with a little better customer service next time this is an easy 5 stars.",

    "text": "Malee's Thai Bistro is a Thai restaurant in Scottsdale.  Good not great in this Yelper's opinion, but you'll find some quality dishes in a contemporary atmosphere.  My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)  Atmosphere - Malee's Thai Bistro has two dining areas.  You'll find a main room and another that accompanies the bar.  On our weekday visit, it was busy, full of energy, and had a nice vibe.  We sat in the room with the bar and it had a nice mural of Southeast Asia on the wall.  1 Star.  Service - Our server was very friendly and helpful.  We did have a problem with one of our dishes (see below) and while she wasn't available during the meal for us to address it, she did have it removed from the bill.  Kudos for that but I would have liked a check in so we could have addressed it earlier.   1/2 Star.  Food - Crispy Basil Chicken - order it.  It's the best item.  You'll get tender, well-seasoned chicken that you can pair with rice or any other noodle dish.  It's slightly sweet with a hint of basil.  We also enjoyed the calamari salad, although it really didn't seem like a Thai dish.  I guess it felt like it was a more American dish vs. Thai, but I was good.  Our Pad Thai was ok - nothing great but nothing bad.  Our one item that was really off was the Pad Woon Sen.  I love this dish - as it has thin glass mung bean noodles, scallions, and egg (main ingredients).  Our dish, however, had a hint of kerosene smell.  As we ate it, something didn't seem right.  We tried to flag down our server but she didn't come back until we were finishing up.  Now, they did remove it from the bill, but it would have been nice to of had the option to replace it instead. 1 Star.  Will I Return? - Maybe.  Aside from the Pad Woon Sen, our meal was good.  Now, I think the menu has a lot of American influences, but there seems to be enough to warrant a return.   1/2 Star.  My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts): 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.   Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",

The Tom Ka soup is probably my favorite menu item, it is probably the most well known Thai soup dish.",

    "text": "I have walked past this place many times and have always seen other people eating here. It also smelled delicious. My partner and I finally gave it a try a few nights ago.  The evening we went to Malee's we found them to be quite busy. I had a brief wait but was seated fairly quickly despite it being a fairly packed house. Definitely give them a point for that one.   The dining experience is where this story takes a downturn; but first, I have to say that our waitress was very courteous and professional. I have nothing but good remarks to say about her. Unfortunately, this is the last positive thing to be said in this review.  We ordered a stir-fry and a rice dish.  The stir-fry came out as an oily soup. Literally the food was drowning. It was incredibly unappetizing.  As for the rice dish, it was the unfortunate victim of extreme overcooking. There was literal lumps of mushed rice in the dish.   What was served to us was pretty sad honestly. I'm not sure if it was an off-night for Malee's, or if our experience was consistent with how they normally operate. However, what I am sure about is that the experience was so poor that I am just not going to bother giving Malee's second try. The whole experience is laughable for the prices they ask.",

I don't trust everyone's take on food.  Given that little unspoken fact, Malee's Thai is among the best and quality Thai places I've ever been.  The restaurant is consistently good and always deliver the best Pad Thai.  This is my bar for Thai food.  I started going to Malee's in 2011 when I moved to Scottsdale for a few years.  It was the most fantastic tasting dishes I've had.  Whenever I go to town I always stop in for some Pad Thai and little toasted tofu appetizers, wow.  All other Thai places have to compete with this quality of food.  Service, owners, dishes, are all very good.  Once there was a bad server over the many years I was there.  Afterward, the owners actually reached out to their community and explained that this particular server was discovered quickly and removed.  They apologized and really owned it.  To me this was an example of that quality leadership principle of stepping up and owning things.    Great place will always stop in for some Thai when I'm in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "Some time ago, I went to Malee's for lunch and was unimpressed.  Close friends of ours insisted that we return with them as our guide to the menu.  To put it succinctly, my eyes have been opened and I see the light.    The only rule was NO PAD THAI.  Rather, we were going to be pushed out of our boring American comfort zone.  We started off with Chicken Satay (delicious, loved the peanut dipping sauce), Tom Yum soup with shrimp medium high spice heat (perfect heat and spice, we wanted more) and the Papaya Salad (not a huge fan but it was quite refreshing after the soup).    Our wonderful guides then took us on short curry tour of Arizona Heatwave (red coconut curry with seafood that was creamy and delicious) and Mussamon Curry (nicely prepared with big flavor). I wish I had taken notes on the curry so I'd know what to look for in the future. We also enjoyed the Drunken Dragon Noodles although they were probably the most 'Americanized' dish on the table.    The True star of the show however was Coco Chili Fish.  Sweet, with a spicy kick and the fish melted in your mouth.  This reminded me of a Thai take on Japanese miso black cod.  On our next visit (and there will be many more in the future) this will be our must have item.  As someone who likes a culinary adventure, I learned that having a knowledgeable guide can make all the difference when trying a new cuisine.  Malee's has a new happy (and repeat) customer.",

The ambience is cosy and we decided to sit outside as it was a bright sunny day. We ordered for the Singha beer, Arizona heatwave with tofu and my husband ordered the cashew nut entree with chicken.  Service - average. The sever came and asked if everything served was ok but when the time came for the bill we kept waiting and eventually had to go inside to ask for it.   Arizona heatwave - I ordered a level 5 spice initially with tofu. However m, the server advised against it stating it's too spicy to handle so I ordered a level 4 instead. When my food arrived it looked red hot but when I tasted the spice was mild and had nothing to do with \"heatwave\". I want the restaurant to understand that people order this dish after looking at the name & description so they pretty much know what they are signing up for! It's just advisable to give them what they ask for. The flavor was good but I certainly missed the spicy kick that I crave for in Thai curries. Also, I specifically asked the server to not add mushrooms but while eating I noticed mushrooms in my curry. we were running out of time so couldn't wait for replacement but she took care of it on the bill: won't probably return.  Cashew nut chicken - husband played it safe & ordered medium heat so it turned out to be extremely bland. Tasted more like a chicken broth with no flavor. We have had the cashew nut entree at other Thai restaurants before and it was so flavorful!  Overall - not happy with our lunch experience here.",

    "text": "Ended up in Scottsdale, and it was getting late.  Hungry crew, so we set out to find some food!  This place had good reviews, so we decided to try it.  Our server (Julie) was very friendly, and attentive.  We ordered chicken fried rice, basil chicken, and Burma gai curry.  The Burma gai was the best of the three.  It came out hot, fresh, and very flavorful.  However it did seem odd to me that this dish includes noodles.  It says so on the menu, but they also bring rice!  That's a bit redundant.  One could argue it should be in the noodle section on the menu.  But the flavor was good.  Both the basil chicken and the fried rice came out luke-warm.  Not hot.  I don't think these were made fresh.  And both lacked any real flavor.  Quite disappointing.  I've definitely experienced better.",

    "text": "Malee's Thai Bistro is definitely a gem of a restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.  It was a Friday evening, and we were both famished. Not wanting to be satiated by just any ordinary meal, Thai seemed like a distinct enough cuisine that would be certain to enliven our taste buds.  As is common with this place, they were packed inside but afforded plenty of room outside. We weren't about to sit in the lobby for too long, as we slowly inhaled the wonderful scents of their various food offerings, without being assured of a seat.  So we jumped at the opportunity to be seated outside, without hesitation.   As I stated, we were famished, so everything on the menu looked absolutely wonderful.  For starters, we ordered the Taste of Thai appetizers. This is comprised of spring rolls, chicken satay, Thai toast, crab rangoons, and potstickers. And to top it all off, they provided size homemade sauces as accompaniment.  Every single bit of these appetizers was absolutely sublime. The spring rolls were not overdone. The Chicken Satay had a wonderful grilled flavor that was simply enhanced by the accompanying sauces.  For our entrees, we ordered the Tamarind Chicken, the Veggie Fried Rice, and the Yellow Chicken Curry.  Nearly all of the items were quite tasty, except for the Chicken Curry. We felt that the Chicken didn't take fresh, or it just wasn't adequately cooked. And the Curry sauce was quite flat and neutral in the spice meter. After having had all of the items put before us, one of these things were just not like the others and that was the Chicken Curry.   Otherwise, our entire meal and dining experience were definitely top notch.",

That is both lunch as well as dinner. Whether it's a date night, girls trip, casual dining or just for fun Malee's is the spot. The food and service has always been five stars.  I had not been here for a while and had the pleasure of dining last night. A few of us ladies were in old town and wanted some Thai Food. We stopped in and ordered a variety of platters from appetizers, rice, noodles, curry to crispy basil chicken. Shareable sizes and perfectly set round tables we all ate good. Our service was winning the whole night. From the moment we walked through the door to the buss staff, wait staff and food servers. Always friendly service with a smile. What I liked is how the staff helped each other. You never saw a table unattended. You always felt welcomed.  Seating inside and out. Lovely bar with a creative menu. Price point that is very reasonable for the area. Anyone can afford to eat here. Portion sizes are plenty.",

    "text": "Probably the worst Thai food I've had in Arizona thus far. I think the location and convenience of this restaurant definitely trumps its food, but everything from the service to the food to the prices were lackluster.   Ambiance inside is interesting; everything seems to be awash in a red-filtered light for some reason. There are standalone tables as well as booth seating, and flies zoomed here and there amongst the diners (not technically the fault of the restaurant I know, but it sure made the experience even more unpleasant). Prices were on the high side, even with the lunch specials. Service was frazzled and inattentive, and everyone from the servers to the busboys avoided eye contact.   My friend and I ordered lunch specials, both from the recommendation of our server.   Soup of the day: The lunch specials came with the option of soup or salad, and this soup was pretty much hot water with some boiled vegetables. The vegetables were also undercooked, and the birth was watery and tasteless.  Side salad: The salad arrived looking like an absolute gloopy mess. The leaves were wilted and a huge glob of peanut sauce had been dolloped haphazardly on the plate. The peanut sauce was deathly sweet and smothered the other ingredients, which completely negated any health benefit of the vegetables.  Fried fish filet: Our server highly recommended this and said it was one of the most popular lunch specials. I'd say it was probably the most expensive item on the lunch menu, so that's perhaps why it was so popular. The fried filets were crispy and decently seasoned, but it was over 50% breading instead of protein. The sauce on top was again too sweet, and it made the fish soggy within a couple of minutes.  Yellow curry with beef: Really sweet curry (are we starting to see a theme here?). The potatoes were undercooked and hard, the meat was tough and chewy, and the curry was on the watery side. It was served very messily as well, with specks of curry dripped all over the plate and rice grains trailing everywhere.   I get that the lunch rush can be crazy, but the restaurant wasn't even full. I don't really understand how this restaurant has nearly 800 reviews and a 4-star average. I immediately went to another Thai restaurant the next day to satisfy my Thai food craving because Malee was so disappointing. I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "I am forever searching for a great Thai Restaurant here in the beach cities area of OC. One that has an inviting ambiance to where you would take your better half for special occasions, or a valued client. Thai in my area are basic strip-mall affairs, although family owned and the food can be really good, just not someplace that invites a relaxing leisurely meal. Wouldn't you know it, I found one, but its almost 400 miles away. Drats!  We enjoyed not only great food and service, but the ambiance and decor were close to being \"upscale.\" Perfect for a date night, or just getting together with friends or family to comfortably unwind. They have a small 10(?) seat bar as well if you desire to go extra casual.  My buddy had made reservations a few days in advance, and we were greeted immediately upon entering and led promptly to our table. Our server arrived in a few short minutes, and with a smile was off to grab our drinks.    What we ordered; Siamese Kisses appetizer: Ground chicken, shrimp & Thai spices topped with crispy garlic & scallions with a trio of sauces. They sorta looked like dumplings, and I assume this is an original creation as I have not seen the likes of this dish anywhere else. No real Thai heat, but really tasty, and paired great with our Chardonnay.   Duck Curry for moi: Marinated duck sliced thin, simmered with fresh tomato and pineapple, in a creamy red curry sauce. I was happy with the large portion, and the duck was extremely tender and flavorful.  That curry sauce was world class, and my request of mild-hot was perfect, and I sopped up as much as I could with my rice.  Loved every bite.   Arizona Heatwave for my buddy: Coconut red curry with sauteed vegetables. He selected shrimp, and requested very hot, and I did witness a bead or two of sweat. He also loved his choice as well. This was the second hottest spice level just below \"Thai Hot.\" Can't imagine ever going there, as I'd rather be able to taste all ingredients, and not just the burn on my palate. To each his own, eh?   Add this to my must do list on my once or twice yearly Scottsdale trips.",

I used to commute to Phoenix, AZ every week for a couple of years for work and would go to Malee's at least once per visit.  I would always take people from my team who travelled with me there and was never disappointed.  My favorites include the Tom Ka Gai soup, Siamese Kisses, Panang Curry, and the Crispy Basil Chicken.  My personal favorite is to order the Crispy Basil Chicken with a side of Panang sauce.  One giant difference between Malee's and any other Thai place I have ever been to is that Malee's is more of a fusion of flavors.  They have taken traditional Thai dishes and flavors and added a spin to them, resulting in flavor combinations that I have never found anywhere else in my extensive business travels.  A must try.  I just wish they had a location near Denver!  Start with some Siamese Kisses and a  bowl of Tom Ka Gai soup, followed by an entree of Crispy Basil Chicken with a side of Panang Curry sauce.  I like my food hot, and usually go with a \"4\" on the heat level.",

I like that sometimes.  This particular time, I liked it, but it was pretty sweet, so you know there was a lot of sugar.  My husband thought the curry was great.  I didn't get to try any though because he made it way too spicy!",

It was tasty but I prolly wouldn't order again, more of an Indian curry than a coconut curry. My colleague ordered the crab Rangoon and those were good. My entree was cashew beef and it had a firey spice, I ordered 4 out of 5 which apparently was Thai hot. It was still good but spicier than my taste buds prefer. Great variety and delicious dessert which I ordered coconut ice cream. I would have preferred the ice cream to be freshly scooped and not scooped and frozen in the cup. It definitely tasted frosty from the freezer-exposed. Still yummy but slightly odd.",

For it being on the Lunch Special menu, it was pretty pricey. $9.99 for a decent portion + choice of soup or salad. I chose and loved the soup, it had a strong ginger taste, and I love me some ginger!  Given it's Scottsdale, where I assume food is a little bit pricier, I won't dwell on the $9.99. But I can honestly say, that the Pad Thai (with shrimp and chicken) was super dry. You could see the clumpy paste of a sauce they put on the dish, and the chicken, yikes! Very, Very dry.  The flavoring was fine, but just toooooooooo dry! I wanted to pour water over the noodles! Towards the end, I was dipping my chicken into my friend's curry as an attempt to soften up the chicken, but it didn't work :(",

The food is alright, there are dishes on the menu that you won't find in normal thai cuisine like the Crispy Calamari Salad, although it was good.  They pump up the AC so the room is freezing and I think the building is old because the acoustics are awful. You can hear every conversation in the room and it's all echoing so you won't be able to hear yourself think!

    "text": "My review:  the restaurant  is pleasant, but very Americanized, probably targeted toward the tourist population.  No pix of the King and Queen, which normally would have caused me to turn around and leave, but we were starving. My companion merely wanted some Khao Pat Thai (Thai fried rice), but they didn't have it on the menu and couldn't make it.  Really, you cannot make a basic staple dish of Thailand? So he ordered Paad Thai, another staple, which should've been simple-but what he got didn't even resemble  Paad Thai, it looked like some messy noodle dish doused in BBQ sauce. How can you mess up Paad Thai?  Makes me think the cook isn't Thai.  I had duck noodle soup, which actually was quite good, so no complaints there and can recommend it.  For some reason we were served brown rice, not jasmine rice, odd.  Also ordered the summer rolls, which primarily consisted of dry rice noodles, very very bland and I don't recommend.  Overall a negative review...never had to give a Thai place a bad review...but this is not a particularly \"Thai\" place.  Companion's comments:   Recommended by employees of a local Asian grocery store so thought it should be decent. First indicator of bad was no picture of the Thai king in the restaurant.  I have been in Thailand and have expectations when I eat Thai food.  The  Pad Thai I had had a BBQ flavor and look to it.  By far the worst Thai food I have had. I would have done better getting an instant Thai meal at the grocery store.  The service was lame, I had to ask for a refill of water to down the BBQ flavored peppers. The waiter never came back except for the check. The bus boy paid more attention to the guests table than the waiter.  If you  are looking for the regulars found in a Thai menu, you will see a bastardized version thus westernizing the food and not particularly authentic.",

It's a pitty that the sake was not fresh made (we got the bottle).  My hubby ordered the duck and I the sampler plate.  The duck was good but .... too cold. The sampler plate : nice presentation but the quality can be better. If this should be our first Thai experience, it should be negative.

For the most part they have done a great job of making things tasty without being overbearing with the heat!   I have tried a new dish each time and love the variety and their own spin on old favorites!  My favs so far are the crab Rangoon, glass noodles, tom ka if you are looking for a great soup. Thai basil is is the choice for tonight   Pad Thai and pad se ew are also quite tasty!  Enjoy! PS... They offer cooking classes with wine pairing one a month!

I basically stuffed my face with scorching hot, delicious curry and ran back to work.. it's unfortunate I didn't really enjoy myself since it was actually pretty good food.

I should preface this with the server only had 3 tables including ours and was within view of all tables 90% of the time, saw that we were ready and actively avoided checking how everything was while she chatted with other servers nearby. She also was loudly combative with another table that arrived as we were leaving.

There are usually long stretches in between my visits but the bartender remembers my name which is great.  I usually end up here when I decide to leave work early and can still catch happy hour. Its a nice quiet bar where I can read and hang out and eat a little. Definitely not the fun chaotic happy hour bar that you might have in mind for gathering with a bunch of friends. Its a quiet little bar which is exactly what I need sometimes.  I've been there a few times. So far I've tried the fried catfish, the tom ka gai soup, wonton soup, spring rolls and shumai dumplings.  Everything is good. ... just not great. Not four stars in my opinion at least. The only thing that should come with a \"no!!\" warning are the shumai dumplings.... They are just over-the-top with garlic. Its literally like eating a clove whole. The Tom Ka Gai soup is very very very good, and loaded with enough chicken for that to be the whole meal if you're eating light. This is a five-star soup, as is their wonton soup. Fried catfish is good, generous portion and not overly battered. Spring rolls are weak. Sure...they're spring rolls, I guess you can't expect too much but at same time they're not too difficult to do well either.  All in all...quaint spot, great service, but food is just okay. I'm willing to give it another shot .... probably more out of convenience than anything else though.",

We had reservations so there was no surprise big group showing up.  Our server was kind of spacy and not really with it.  He did not respond to our questions about items on the menu and when he did he mumbled.  Now normally I wouldn't care about this but add the rest of his service and this made for an annoying time.  When we were done eating we asked for our checks.  Thirty minutes later he finally came with our checks; where we proceeded to promptly provide form of payment.  Then we waited....10 minutes, 20 minutes.  We were being held captive since Malee's had our cards.  When he came to us again he had some of the receipts for us to sign, but not all.  They signed and he came back and said he needed all of our cards again.  After waiting for over an hour just to close our tab out and leave, I complained to the manager and he simply brushed aside my concern. It should never take over an hour just to get your bill, pay and leave.  If the food wasn't so good, this review would have been a 1-star.",

BLAH BLAH BLAH  Tom Ka Gai  - supposed to be signature dish - came lukewarm - we asked for it to be heated - waited 10 min and it came out boiling near center of serving dish but was still lukewarm! why cooks dont take the soup out and heat in a pan and TASTE IT to make sure it is hot i never know - they stick it under broiler so top gets burned but never check or stir. . ...anyway it was thick, and not very appetizing - no delicate flavors of lemongrass and galangal but huge chunks / slices of precooked chicken - that's it with some green chopped onions thrown on top - methinks not a signature dish - yuck  Pad Thai - too heavy with tomato sauce and no good flavor - no subtleties of bean sprouts, just cooked noodles and peanut - just one solid mass of glob.  YUCK AGAIN....the shrimp were good sized but had been boiled in water and thrown in at last minute so no flavors melded - where was the delicate Nam Pla flavor or the crunch of bean sprouts? no where to be found here - blah   Green Basil Curry with Pork - which was neither green nor did it contain any Thai basil - this dish is advertised as \"think Thai pesto curry\" - well it is NOT that at all..supposed to be in an assortment of green vegetables - well all there was was green pepper and green beans - and the green pepper didnt work at all - the meat was bland and dish overpowered by acrid flavor of bell pepper - if i were making it i'd add lots of Thai basil, use Chinese long beans and maybe add some carrot - but not green pepper ...also meat needed to be seasoned not just boiled in liquid.    i will not be going back.",

They are very generous with their portions, and it's definitely worth it to pay a couple dollars more for the large size. You should also try some of their specialty cocktails, I would recommend the Thai Tea Margarita. The mango with sweet sticky rice is also a great dessert to end on.",

It's a very nice place for a date or an evening out.  Most of the other people in the the restaurant seemed to be paired up, although I'm sure they can arrange for larger groups.  The waitress was very pleasant and attentive the whole time.  All the food was extremely colorful and pleasing to look at, and also very tasty, as were their cocktails..  This place is very good for vegetarians because they have a vegetarian section in their menu, saving the trouble of having to search through the menu looking for vegetarian stuff.  I ordered the Hippy Noodle, which was tofu with noodles and vegetables.  It was really good.  My date had the basil chicken, which also looked really good.  I had the creme brulee for dessert, which was excellent.  I would give this place five stars except that my food was a little too spicy.  They ask you at the beginning how spicy you want your food on a scale of 1-5, and I asked for a 3, which the waitress said was a very tolerable level.  I was expecting a moderately spicy meal, but it turned out to be a little more than that.  I had to take a sip of water after every bite, and my sinuses were about to fire up.  I was on a date so I figured it would be better to eat less food rather than fight through the spiciness and have watery eyes and a runny nose.  Not attractive.    The whole street is full of art galleries, and it would have been really nice to have been able to walk down the street and browse through them after dinner, but everything on the street closes a little early.    Overall, this was a really good experience.  The whole bill came out to be $60, and that includes drinks, entrees, and dessert.  I thought it was very reasonable.",

There are so many great things on the menu.Next time we'll try something different. Kudos to Karen our waitress. She was so helpful and fun too",

Let's just say that any Thai restaurant that gives me my choice of \"levels of spicyness\" already has won my heart!  They offer 1-5, I ordered 5 and it was mouthwatering!  I got the drunken noodles with shrimp (my staple thai dish) and it did not disappoint. Yes, my sinuses were runny, but I like Thai experiences that do that to me so ALL GOOD!!",

The skinny  I am not much of a big Thai food guy but every now and then I get a taste for the peanut chicken from here and drive all the way from the west valley. The price is not great but it is affordable I also just saw a 20% off with check in on yelp awesome. I have had a few drinks rum and coke great mix more liquor than soda which I appreciate. The staff is awesome I usually speak with Kris and the team and they always make my visit great and my check out quick as I'm always in a hurry damn meters :-). I have met the owner Diedra a few times and she is an absolute delight she makes u feel welcome like you have been coming here for years. I can't compliment this place enough for the staff and food I think I will have the tamarind chicken here very soon.  The bad  Nothing. The parking in Scottsdale is a joke on weekends but if your from here you know that already.  Overall This place deserves a visit especially with the check in special. The staff and good will sell you I'm sure of this.",

Once I retired and moved to Scottsdale I immediately launched a search for Thai food.  At the time (42 years ago) there was only several restaurants in the valley that claimed to be Thai orientated.  Once I found Malee's I was in heaven.  A small restaurant, intimate and as close to the real thing that you can get in the states.  They cater to the American pallet, however; just ask for the real spicy Thai offering, they will be more than happy to accommodate you.  Whenever I am asked to recommend (any kind) an Asian restaurant, I always suggest that they try Malee's.  If you are a real connoisseur of the cuisine of Thailand, you will really enjoy Malee's bill of fare.",

Based on my friend's recommendations, I tried the Arizona Heatwave with chicken which is a red curry with a variety of sauteed vegetables (water chestnuts, broccoli, bell peppers, celery, carrots).  Not wanting to venture into the Thai hot territory, I ordered my dish just regular spicy and it was delicious. The balance of flavors was just spectacular and the amount of food was plentiful.  I also like the fact that they do not charge extra for brownrice which we had plenty of.  The service was impeccable and never missed a beat. Prices may be a little higher than average compared to other Thai restaurants. However considering the quality and amount of food, no complaints here.",

I commented that the soup on which I was slurping was famous for its rich and smokey aroma. It wasn't until we became covered in ashes that my assertion came into question.

I've had a couple different appetizers and entrees and I've narrowed it down to two favorites. The Siamese Kisses app is fricken delicious and the Pad Thai is :drool: amazing.   They do their spice level from 1 to 5. 1 being no spice at all and 5 being Thai hot. Ive ordered the Pad Thai at a 3 and a 4 and I think I prefer the 3. Level 4 is definitely manageable but it kind of burns the tummy afterward.. Which is just slightly unpleasant.   I absolutely love eating here and consider them my \"go to\" for dining out. They also have a rewards card, which for every 200 points, you get a gift card. They also send you stuff for your birthday and anniversary.   Yummmmmmm!",

    "text": "It really pains me to give this place such a low review, but our experience today went from good to poor in a matter of an hour.  We walked into an empty restaurant around 3:00 this afternoon and were immediately greeted by an Asian man who was very nice.  The inside of this restaurant is very nice and very clean.  A nice guy filled up our water glasses and then we waited for our server to come.  About 4-5 people came in right after us and were also seated.  However, our waiter, Kevin, serviced the other two tables before us, even though we had come in first.  He finally came over to us and took our drink orders and appetizer order.  We received the appetizer and then he asked what we wanted for our meals.  After giving him our order, we started eating the appetizer which was a sampling of 5-6 items and it was delicious.  We then received our entrees (Panang Curry, Yellow Curry and 2 Pad Thai's).  Everything was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  We commented on how this was the best Thai food we have ever had in Arizona and how it would definitely be on our weekly list of restaurants to visit.  I even got ready to announce to all of my \"foody\" friends on Facebook who live in Arizona that this is a must place to visit.  Kevin did not really check on us after we got the food but did come to our table to bring the bill and box up our leftovers.  Judging by the service we received, I left a 10 percent tip because I felt it was a reasonable amount for the service he provided.  The service was good but certainly not spectacular.  Here's where the experience turned from good to poor.  After I paid the bill, our waiter, Kevin, came up to our table and asked me if there was something wrong with the service/food we received in which I replied, \"No, it was good\".  He then had the nerve to say to me, \"Well your tip was lacking\".  My group and I were completely blown away by his response.  For one, it was very unprofessional and two, very out of line.  I have never had a waiter say anything so rude to me in my entire life.  I was shocked by this guy's behavior.  We walked to our car and my group told me to go back and ask for a manager (I am not a confrontational person).  I called the restaurant after we left and asked for the owner, Deidre.  Her daughter answered the phone and said she really is never in.  She took my name and number and after about an hour, Deidre called me back.  She immediately asked how much I tipped then started to say \"15% is standard in today's industry\".  She also immediately started backing her waiter Kevin up by saying she knew him since he was 2 and that he was the hardest working person in her restaurant.  It is really hard to explain a situation to someone who only sees what they want to see and only hears what they want to hear.  I was ready to just hang up the phone because I really felt I was never given the chance to fully explain my side of the story.  I finally had a chance to explain and even though she said Kevin shouldn't have done what he did, she said she didn't want to pursue this any further.  It really is a shame that Deidre does not care about what her customers tell her.  Without feedback from customers, how do you expect to fix/remedy customer service issues?  I normally tip 15 to 20% at certain restaurants when the service is spectacular.  Today's service was not spectacular and there was no way I was going to tip higher than 10%.  I felt like Kevin acted like a spoiled brat and should really be ashamed by what he said to me.  There are so many other restaurants in Scottsdale who care about their customers and want to make things right.  We will not be returning to this place.",

By the way if you enjoy coffee, try their Thai coffee ice cream for dessert. My husband ordered the lunch portion of noodle soup with BBQ duck and it was amazing. The Tom Ka Gai soup was possibly the best Tom Ka Gai I've ever had. Try it at medium spice level and go up from there depending on how spicy you like food. All in all, amazing experience.

    "text": "In love...and coming from a very picky pregnant woman, at that! Service was outstanding, prices were much lower than expected and the food was amazing. Not to mention the ginormous servings, especially for the modest pricing! Our waitress, server and waitstaff were all friendly, accommodating, checked on us often, kept the drinks full, and food was prepared in great time considering they were packed. Ordered spring vegetable rolls as an appetizer and it was out pretty quickly. Sauce and rolls were both perfect and just as anticipated. Just as we finished our rolls, our dinner was served. Drunken dragon noodles was the best I've had and the portion was very generous. Our pedi date ran late, so by the time we got to dinner, I was starving (and prego!), and I still ended up taking half my dinner home in a to-go, as did my friend who ordered a coconut fish plate. Both dinners plus appetizer totaled under $50. In AZ on business for another week and will DEF return before leaving town!",

Over the warm chicken was a warm thick peanut curry sauce that was garnished with a few raw red pepper strips making it sort of like a salad. I asked for a spice level of hot but to me it tasted medium. It was good and tasty   and I took half home.  My husband had a cup of soup that had good size pieces of dark meat chicken in what seemed like a home made stock with what I think was lettuce in the soup. He ordered the cashew chicken extra hot but thought it seemed just hot. I tasted the cashew chicken and thought it seemed oily but OK.  I liked that they offer white or brown rice.  But the ladies room was not pleasant due to a pig woman that came by before me so I left quickly. I guess she had BROWN rice.",

I have eaten Thai food in Thailand, Brooklyn, NYC, Chicago, Florida, LA, Toronto and many other places. Specific issues with the food: Tom Kha Gai was horribly balanced and just tasted a bit like hotwing sauce with lots of lemongrass, coconut was barely notable as a background flavor. It was bright red, for God's sake!  Anyone who eats a lot of Tom Kha Gai knows it is NOT supposed to be bright red. The fried spring rolls were incredibly greasy (likely fried at the wrong temperature) and instead of being served with traditional Thai chili sauce they were served with that radioactive red sweet and sour sauce like what you get from cheap Chinese takeout places.  The drunken noodles (Pad Kee Mao) were thin noodles and again not very flavorful.  I'm not sure who is cooking this food or where they are from but this is a HORRIBLE representation of Thai cuisine.  I can only surmise that the current rave reviews on yelp are from paid employees, people who have never eaten Thai food, or people without taste buds altogether.  Will NEVER eat here again.",

The girl that took my order was not at all friendly.  She was actually a bit rude.  Beyond that I just simply was not thrilled about the food and it was so expensive!  The salad rolls and sauce were flavorless and the dessert that I remember loving last time had a funny mesquite aftertaste that I didn't like.  I have to order gluten free and so had to get the fried rice house special without the sausage ...so without the meat it was $14-15 for the dish!  I mean really, that much for veggie fried rice?  I don't typically leave bad reviews but I just didn't have a great experience and regret spending so much $$.  Oh well.  I wouldn't refuse to go back or anything, but I wont seek it out again.",

Lots of posts on here stated that a 3 wasn't even close to hot so I asked the server for thai hot and she warned that even a 3 was very hot. I was skeptical because I thought she probably really didn't eat hot but when our food arrived it was so hot I couldn't eat much of it although it was really good. I love hot food, habeneros and serranos are my favorite peppers and I can handle a lot of heat. So I'm not sure what the deal was, maybe they made a mistake on mine and gave me thai hot however it was all three of the dish's we ordered....just order with caution so you can enjoy your food!I would have given more stars but since I couldn't even eat my food 3 was all I could give.",

Appetizers: Vegetable spring rolls and tofu spinach potstickers.  Spring rolls were heavenly. I didn't enjoy the potstickers as much; they were too bland for my taste.  Main Course: Jalapeno fried rice (substituted sausage for fried tofu), pad thai with fried tofu, and bombay curry with fried tofu. I'm not a fried rice person but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. Pad thai was just as delicious, and the Bombay curry had a very unique flavor. It was almost like a panang curry but better. I ordered everything at medium spicy, and it was perfect for me. I have a low-medium spice tolerance. They bring you a thai hot sauce if you need the extra kick!  I really liked that they had small and large portions. I ordered everything large portioned, and it was more than enough food for 4 people to share. Pretty sure I have leftovers for the next three days.   Overall, can't wait to return!

    "text": "I'd like to start off by saying how much I love the food at Malees. I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, but I have been ordering take out every Sunday for the past two years and place the same order every time - crispy basil chicken (AMAZING), shrimp pad thai and tom yum or tom ka ga soup. I've also tried the yellow curry which has great flavor as well.  As much as I enjoy the food, the take out service has been on a slight decline over the past few months. First happening was a time they completely forgot to enter my order into the system - okay fine, I let that go because I'm sure they were slammed and oops, we all make mistakes. But then it happened a few more times, and then a 20 minute wait (told over the phone) turns into a 40 minute wait...and so on and so forth.  I've been using yelp for a number of years and I typically don't write a complaint unless something really ticks me, which unfortunately occurred tonight. I call in to place my Sunday order, but this time I decide I only want tom yum soup - simple enough. I'm given a 20 minute wait time (order placed via phone at 6:39 PM). I get there at the assigned time, right at about 7 PM and wait for 10 minutes at which point I ask for an estimated wait time. The host comes back only to tell me she can't give me a wait time because the kitchen is so busy and she has no clue..........okay? Another 5 minutes goes by and I ask a different host. She comes back from the kitchen and grabs the first host and they both scurry away - completely avoiding me (hard to do at the front because it has a small lobby/entry way). They finally come back around and continue to avoid me, so on top waiting, now the hosts are ignoring a paying customer. I worked in the restaurant industry and I get it - when a guest is frustrated it's a shitty situation you don't want to deal with but guess what - you have to! Another five minutes goes by and I asked a third host how much longer - it's a cup of soup! I inform her I may just cancel because at this point, it's just not worth the way and built up frustration. She comes back [and can finally give me an answer] and tells me it will probably be another 10 minutes. Another 10 minutes? No, thanks, I'll cancel. I ask to speak with a manager as I then seem to wait another 7 minutes for that.......so I left, and never spoke to anyone.  During this whole wait, not once did they every apologize for the long wait or even ask to take care of the cost for me (not that I care because a cup of soup is only $5, but it's the principal). Malee's I love you, but PLEASE get this figured out.",

I don't recall how many times I've reviewed Malee's but it always turns out for the better for both of us.  Malee's has been a highlight of for Thai food in Oldtown for quite some times as I recalled when I first moved here; and you know what....it still is!  Tonight was a special night as some of my friends and I gather for a birthday party and feast.  We ordered a bottle of wine and went for it.  I ordered their Crispy Pla (A.K.A Fish Candy).  They have other dishes that I love like the Crispy Basil Chicken; bite sized chicken glazed with a tamarind chili sauce, and Drunken Dragon Noodles; rice noodles and chicken tossed with basil and bean sprouts and lightly green curry sauce.  Everyone around the table wasn't sure about my order because of the name, but as dishes were being passed around my dish was becoming the star of the night.  Crispy fried fish drizzled with sweet and spicy pickled jalapeno garlic sauce on a bed of cabbage.  The sauce really was the star since I'm sure you could put in on chicken, beef, or pork and it would still be a great dish.  I love Malee's for their traditional take on Thai food, but also the ability to fuse an American style to enhance it's food.  Overall, Malee's is a must go if you're ever in Oldtown Scottsdale!",

I don't know what coffee bean that is but that ice cream is to die for. It's a great place to eat al fresco as well as dine in.",

    "text": "Staff is friendly and accommodating. Food not so much. The dishes seem to cater to an American palate, and had large servings, which I think would have been fine had it actually tasted good. Overall it felt like I was eating from the \"Asian\" section of a McDonald's menu.  I ordered the Siamese Kisses and the Tom Ka Gai to start (spiciness level 2), and then Arizona Heatwave curry (level 3). I was told by the waitress that 3 was very hot, on a scale from 1-5.  The Siamese Kisses were okay. They resembled the shape of shumai, just minus the shrimp and rice, and was topped with a crunchy garlic crumble. They came on a bed of lettuce/salad mix. It said it consisted of crumbled chicken, and it indeed tasted like it. But that was really it. The garlic topping was honestly the most flavorful part of the whole dish, which doesn't really say much for it. The salad bed was also soaked in the grease of the kisses. You know how you can eat a burger, and it'll be greasy, but that's fine because it tastes like the cow lived a luxurious and pampered life, and put every moment into the burger? This was not that. It tasted like they dipped each kiss in canola oil \"to taste\".  The Tom Ka Gai was weird. It tasted like someone dumped coconut curry into french onion soup. The chickens and onions tasted fine, but it didn't necessarily taste good. Maybe that's your thing? Just felt odd to me. The spiciness of this dish seemed to come from the ginger (and actually tasted spicier than the heatwave curry I ordered afterwards).  The Arizona heatwave curry felt bland. It definitely felt like I was missing something the entire time I tried to eat it. It came with vegetables, rice, and your meat of choice. I could taste the vegetables, as well as the meat that was in it. But it just didn't feel like a cohesive dish? The curry was not flavorful at all. Some Thai places add too much of something, and the coconut, or maybe the spice ends up being too overwhelming and literally punches you screaming \"I'M HERE\". This curry tastes like the underachiever in class who works just enough to qualify, but is hardly passing. It tastes like enough like a curry to qualify, not enough to taste good.  Regardingy the \"very hot\" as my waitress described - level 3 was less spicy than Sriracha. When I mentioned this to the waitress, she brought me an array of 4 different spicy pastes/items to mend this (garlic chili paste, red chili powder, Sriracha, and Thai chili peppers in a sweet sauce). Adding any of them did not make it taste any better (nor spicier).  Overall, it was just very okay, bordering on subpar. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Perhaps I just picked the \"wrong\" dishes/came at a bad time - regardless, I did not enjoy the food here.",

I expected to be covered in snot, but I barely noticed the heat. And...it all tasted a bit vinegary. The ambiance is really nice. The rest of the people in our party were happy, so I give this at least three stars. Oh, and the prices indicate they're much prouder of the food than its actual quality.",

However, the restaurant is casual, relaxed with a full bar.   My Wife and I had a great time we ordered 1/2 portion of a curried dish for the appetizer then the soft shell crabs for our entree.  For dessert, we recommend walking down to the \"Sugar Bowl\" which is known for being AZs first Ice Cream shop (first ever in the state of AZ). The sugar bowl has the best ice cream if you want something like this for dessert.  At night time the Old Town Scottsdale area is beautiful with the lights on the palm trees and quaint one-story buildings, and so many art dealers you probably will not have the time to see them all.  Also, there are many fine jewelry stores.   Many-many Art Dealers surround the restaurant. The best time to shop in this area would be during the daytime, business hours.",

    "text": "COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!  After my disappointing experience with Malee's at Desert Ridge several years ago I pretty much wrote the chain off.  That is, until I was with a few friends on a Sunday evening looking for a bite to eat after visiting the DBG for the Chihuly exhibit.  The four of us decided on Thai & our friend that was driving mentioned Malee's.  We all agreed to give it a try after we realized that the other mentioned options were closed on Sunday evening.  To start, Malee's atmosphere was not bad.  The dinning room was clean (or seemed so) & was well decorated for a Thai restaurant.  The service was marginal...  Our server proceeded to explain all of the specials, all of which he pretty much said were not good.  Pretty strange, but I always appreciate the honesty, but needless to say, we ordered off of their regular menu.  The food...  The food was OK, nothing special.  I absolutely LOVE great Thai food, however, this was not much better than what you would be served at a Chinese restaurant.  Presentation was great, but the food was missing the real Thai flavors & covered with tons of sodium-rich sauce & oil.  For those of you who rave about this place, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama for excellent authentic Thai cuisine.  Back to the COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!  After the four of us had our first serving of food with rice, I went in for another serving of rice from the community bowl to try my partners dish.  Amongst the rice was a \"friend\" looking up at me, a COCKROACH.  Although I am vegetarian, the fact that an animal was in the rice did not freak me out.  Cockroaches, however are not a sign of cleanliness in a restaurant.  I already had my concerns after visiting the restroom to wash my hands before dinner, what a freaking mess!  But that's another show...  After finding the cockroach in the rice, I brought this to the server's attention, trying not to make a scene & upset my friends who had all already eaten from the rice bowl.  I requested a fresh bowl of rice & explained the problem.  He saw it & agreed to bring a new bowl, which he did shortly thereafter.    One big problem that I have with Malee's is that we did not receive any sort of apology for being served a COCKROACH in our rice.  I was not looking for a free dinner, but an apology was in order for such a disgusting situation from both the server & a manager/owner would have been nice.  Obviously the server & or management did not care that they served us a COCKROACH in our food.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about sanitation.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about their customers health & well-being as long as they get their money.  Needless to say, I will never go back here again.  If you are looking for a good, authentic, sanitary Thai feast, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama.",

The to-die-for food. And of course the memories, since I've celebrated a few of my life's key events here (namely both my college and law school graduations).   Oddly enough the decor is closer to that of an up-scale gourmet American place than what's actually on the menu: Thai food. But the combination works. The tom kha gai soup is the best I've had anywhere in the US. The beer and wine selections are excellent.   Simply put this is a restaurant where it's obvious that the owner works very hard to make sure your entire experience as a customer will be first-class.   There is a second Malee's in north Scottsdale that I've never been to.",

This week a group of coworks and I (4 total) went for lunch at my recommendation - none of the other had been there. It was a disappointing experience.  I had the crispy fish from the lunch menu -- it was extremely sweet - overpowering actually - not any other flavor.  Another had the Chicken Panang and asked for it spicy - there was little heat to it.  Another had the Arizona Heatwave - it was mosly sauce, very little vegetables. We also had the crab rangoon appetizer. Another disappointment - it was extremely fishy tasting - we each only tried one of them.  After lunch on the way back to the office I asked everyone what they thought - and everyone agreed it was a \"one\" time dining experience for them.  It is too bad that Malee's has degraded so much.  I will not be going back.",

It sure beats the taste of bitter, burnt plastic that overwhelmed my poor noodles.  2 stars because the server was super nice and didn't charge me for my dinner without me having to ask.

The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the staff was very pleasant, efficient and professional, even for a large group.  The food was the opposite.  After trying all of the items that were listed as \"must try's\" by other yelpers, I was VERY disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

The food here is decent.  The atmosphere is nicer than most Thai places. However, for the price, the quality of the food is a bit lacking and inconsistent. For example, I'll use my favorite Malee's dish--the seafood curry. I've ordered it 5 times and 3 x's it was great, 2x's the seafood was very over cooked and dry. At Malee's prices, that's not kosher.  However, one thing I have to give them credit for is service--it's excellent.  The manager is very professional, courteous and does an awesome job taking care of any mistake from the kitchen.  if you want Thai in an atmosphere that's more upscale than traditional Thai restaurants, try Malee's. if you don't care and/or are a cheapskate like me, and/or desire more traditional Thai, try Thai Basil in Tempe.",

I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but being from San Francisco and hav ing spent a month in Thailand, my standards really are pretty high here.    The Tom Ka Gai soup is top top notch, I have gotten it every time.  Super yum.  Tonite I had the special spicy prawn & calamari with peppercorns, 'shrooms, and broccoli.  Maybe a tiny bit too sweet, but overall wonderful.    I got both dishes straight up \"spicy\" (but not thai spicy!) and they totally got the heat level right.    Finished it off with mango and sweet sticky rice.  I have had some not-so-memorable dishes too, but nothing was ever bad, and tonite was so good what the hell I'm going to give 'em 5 stars.",

Then I had the Arizona Heatwave Curry, which was perfectly spiced.  The second night, I tried the veggie rolls (the fresh ones, not the fried ones), which came with two sauces (one a peanut hoisin and the other a spicy sauce).  These were delicious, with very fine noodles.  However, they were a bit messy to eat.  I also had the yellow vegetarian curry,  which was far too mild for my liking.   Service was excellent both nights.  Great to be able to dine outside.  The most interesting thing about the place was a drink that some of my dining companions ordered -- a Thai cosmo, which was made with chili-infused vodka.  That sure had a kick!  One sip was enough for me. I would definitely go back to Malee's if I were in the area again.",

Consistently GREAT food and good service, large portions and well priced too. Our most recent Trip was on mother's Day, we saw Stomp and came out hungry around 4pm - we called and got in before the crowd w/no reservations and had yet another great meal.   The atmosphere is casual but nice and the emphasis is on the food. Malees is located on 5th Ave just west of Scottsdale and has a TON of street parking available as most of galleries that surround it are closed at dinner time anyway. They also serve lunch, man I need to go there more often! Favorite Standout dishes include the traditional soups, Thai Stick appetizers, the best fried tofu in town with peanut dipping sauce (a really simple dish that's apparently easy to f*ck up based on what I've had elsewhere), beef panang (not on the menu so just order it), of course pad-thai and a dish I think they call candied fish that is two HUGE whitefish fillets that are very lightly breaded and flash fried and drizzled with a sweet chilie sauce, to call it sweet and sour would be insulting, way better and more nuanced. They have anice little patio when weather permits, can take parties from 2 to 8 with no problem and take and actually KEEP reservations. (Am I the only one who gets pissed if he makes a reservation, shows up on the dot and waits an hour?) Crowd is mixed and widely varied from new age sandal-foots exploring the East by eating noodles to tourists, locals, first dates, and of course the usual assortment of Indian and Asian families that lets you know they know how to use spices. I'd give it five stars as pefection if the decor was a little more exciting, it's not bad, just not all that it could be on that front, but here I am really looking for one thing to complain about - this is one of my favorite places in town and a place I always take visting guests.",

Pad thai: This wasn't traditionally made... It had like an interesting BBQ-like sauce... making it not so pad thai tasting. Ok, I guess. Evil Jungle Princess: We ordered it because of its peculiar name Not a huge fan - the curry was semi-sour flavored, which was weird to me... but edible still. Fresh Summer roll: It hit the spot for a refreshing appetizer. Thai tea: Too sweet.  Friendly waitress. I disliked all the hovering though. Staff were overly attentive, so our waters were filled every 5 minutes, and it got annoying to me having to move out of the way and having a person reach over me to fill a still half full glass. Also, as each dish was done, they were quick to take it away. So if you can imagine by the end of our meal and the 7 of us finishing each dish one by one, they'd be back every ~3 minutes to take away one plate/fill a glass.",

We had a hard time deciding on just three but finally selected the Pad Thai Noodles, the Chicken Panang and the Bombay Curry. No regrets here, all three small plates were delicious. The Pad Thai was flavorful, the Bombay Curry was an assortment of veggies in a creamy yellow curry and the Chicken Panang was chicken in a kaffir lime curry with carrots and bell peppers.

We have had better Coconut chicken soup, but it may have been because it was cooked down to the consistency of a salty porridge...  The Burma Gai at a level 3 spiciness was just the right amount of heat to be interesting at first and have you blowing your nose by the end of the meal!

The woman at the front desk, older and a little bit round, had a cast on her arm.... had zero sense of urgency to get us seated. She sat there and fiddled around trying to find us a place to sit (mind you, there were about TWENTY OPEN TABLES all around us)... I'm sorry, if youre holding a bunch of open tables for reservations but you have 2 people in front of you who are starving and ready to eat, you should probably forfeit a table to them; I dont know if that was the case I can only assume. She then struck up a conversation with someone while we stood behind them while they carried on for a solid five minutes. We walked out.",

    "text": "When I walked through the door and was greeted by an American staff, I knew this wasn't going to be a Thai joint. But I was hungry and we had hungry kids, so we stayed for lunch. Dishes we ordered:  1. Panang curry - the flavor was ok but it was too watery. I felt like I was having soup vs curry  2. Pad Thai - the sauce had a weird flavor that was not authentic to the phad Thai at all. I was confused eating it lol  3. Pad Kee Mao (Drunken noodles) - this is my fav noodle dish of all time. Been eating it my entire life. This was the most disappointing dish we ordered. They used pad thai noodles for the dish, and the flavoring was so off. It was like me ordering spaghetti but they served me fettuccine alfredo.   4. Sesame chicken salad with noodles. I didn't even care to try this dish. Nothing about it was Thai.   Overall, the restaurant was clean and had nice staff. However, the food is not quite Thai food. It's Americanized Asian food, that caters to the palettes of those who doesn't know authentic Thai food. Maybe I'm biased because I'm part Thai and grew up eating the real stuff all my life. But I've also had amazing Thai food all over America. The best Thai food is of course in Los Angeles Thai town. Even San Fran, NY, NC, and Portland are few cities that has my fav Thai restaurants.   Personally, today for me, I just consumed wasted calories lol. I'm still craving my drunken noodles! Once I get home from this vacay, I'm going to whoop it up in the kitchen, True Thai style, with the correct noodles.",

    "text": "Celebrated my daughter's birthday. Had reservations at 6:30 and when we walked in, we were seated immediately. Our seats were opposite the bar and we were seating near a group of 6. The area is small, so all the conversations were bouncing off the walls and we had to lean in to talk to each other.   Our drinks consisted of Hot Tea $2, Petite Sirah $10 and a large bottle of Sapporo $8. Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable. When my tea got cold, she brought me a fresh pot of hot tea.    We started off with the Coconut Shrimp (6) and you can taste the freshness of the coconut and the mango-pineapple dipping sauce, and a sweet pickled jalapeno sauce were amazing.   Our entrees were the Spicy Cashew Beef, Pad Thai and Crispy Basil Chicken. The Spicy Beef was very flavorful and the sauce was excellent; Pad Thai was loaded with chicken and shrimp, the sweet paprika vinaigrette was a bit tart. I tasted all the dishes and I can see why the Crispy Chicken is a BIG hit.  Our dessert was Brulee and Pumpkin Custard. I've had larger portions of Brulee for $6. This one was in a ramekin. My Pumpkin Custard was really different which was served in a pumpkin that was 1/4 of the pumpkin. You ate everything down to the skin.  One thing to remember, they have a His/Her bathroom. Yes, singular, ONE bathroom which is in the bar area in the back right. Also, watch out for those aggressive bus boys. They are constantly clearing the plates from the table.",

    "text": "We have been to Malee's many times and it has been our favorite Thai place in the area for years.  However, our visit this week left us wondering if we will ever be back again.  Service was definitely subpar and the food was equally disappointing.  First, we were seated in the smaller dining area to the right of the entrance.  There was a pianist playing on an electric keyboard so there was very little room to maneuver.  I literally had to move the table in order to get to my seat and my husbands chair was up against the chair of table behind us.  We were bewildered as the hostess kept cramming people into this tiny room when the larger room behind us was practically empty.  When our waitress initially came by, we said we needed just another minute before ordering.  20 minutes later .... we had to hunt her down.  We ordered the duck, the Burma chicken and a small order of the Thai chow mein.  After another long wait the duck and chow mein were served .... both dishes we had never had there before.  The duck was pretty good, but the noodles left a lot to be desired.  First, the portion size of the noodles at $11.99 was definitely not worth price.  It was more like a $6.99 portion.  Secondly, the noodles were in clumps.  Like they just dumped them in a pot with too little water and didn't bother to stir them to separate them.  After getting half way through these dishes we had to hunt down our waitress again and ask about the Burma chicken.  Her response that she didn't think we order that.  I had to remind her that my husband specifically asked her whether ordering the small noodles and the 2 entrees (one of them being the chicken) would be enough.  We actually came here specifically for the Burma chicken.  It's been my favorite dish here since we first came to Malee's.  For the first time, it was a huge disappointment.  The stronger curry flavor with just a touch of sweetness made it stand out from other Thai curry's at other restaurants.  Unfortunately, that night it was much heavier on the coconut milk and lighter on the curry.  Don't know if they have changed management or ownership, but the service and the food were not what we had come to expect from them.",

The food was tasty, although clearly \"tamped down\" to suit the clientele that frequents this area.  The 'medium spicy\" would be considered mild in most places with a large Asian population, so I recommend ordering a level higher than you would in places like LA, San Francisco, or Houston.  Still, the food is well-prepared and presented, and the waitstaff is very professional and friendly.  We would return if we're in this area again.",

I think they give very generous portions of the soup here and the ingredients taste so fresh! The flavor of the soup was spot on! 2) Pad Kee Mao: Noodles were perfect, the taste was amazing! Couldn't get enough of this dish! 3) Spring rolls: fresh and delicious! Really refreshing on a hot summer night! 4) Seafood curry: they use really good quality seafood for this dish, which made the dish taste SUPER flavorful! I couldn't get enough of the curry poured over a bed of rice! YUMMY!  Ambiance:  More of an upscale, \"fancier\" place. The place was sufficiently lite but there was a candle on every table for that \"romantic\" feel. The decor was nice, which made it a comfortable place to dine. It was a little loud, for some reason the noise from other tables carried really well at this place. The BIG mirror in the bathroom is a little creepy, but that's probably just because I've watched way too many horror movies.   Service:  Our waiter was the nicest, most genuine guy. He was very attentive to our needs and would always check up on us to make sure we were taken care of. Service was awesome! We tipped extra :)  Price:  A little more on the pricey side, but it's not CRAZY outrageous. I think it's worth it considering how good the quality and taste of the food was!  Overall:  I really liked this place, I would totally come back here for a good Thai meal!",

Nothing is perfect.  Not every customer is going to have the best food in their life.  Everyone's tastes are different.  That means no owner or manager has the right to disregard what a paying customer has to say.  Take the information you're so lucky to receive and learn and grow from it.   I had to get that off my chest. I liked the food here, but the service was lackluster.  Just because you close at 10 doesn't mean you should turn the bright lights on and turn off the music as a cue to the diners who just got their food to hurry up and get out.  If you want to be closed up and left the building by the closing time on the door, then you shouldn't seat people an hour before closing.  We were on our way out when I saw this happen to a couple other tables.   The food was good.  Americanized Thai food.  I'd go back if someone asked me, but I don't foresee myself having any Malee's cravings.",

We ventured on a Friday night and were pleased with the cute location, nice decor and Friday night atmosphere. Four stars.  Menu looked GREAT - standard favorites mixed in with a few dishes for the more adventurous. I unabashedly do not fall in the latter category - I ordered summer rolls and Pad Thai.  The summer rolls were a huge disappointment - dry chicken, too much noodles, ZERO flavor. The only thing we could taste was the plum sauce, which let's be honest was a really WEIRD condiment choice. It completely overpowered the dry chicken and bland noodles, and the overall effect was not a terrible flavor combination. Nonethless, they were *technically* edible, and I ate them.  Good thing too, as the Pad Thai was revolting and tasted basically like a chicken-flavored lollipop. With every sickly sweet bite I lamented the absence of nuttiness and savory tang - the normal province of a Pad Thai. I pushed away most of my half portion. (On a side note, portions are pretty enormous so half portions are a good idea , terrible food aside).  Nice place, great atmosphere, good service. Shame about the food.",

The counter girl at the spa suggested Malee when I inquired about a nice place to dine at.

No Thai or even Asian host or hostess to guide you to the table and this place looked too fancy for some authentic Thai food.  And surely enough, the food sucked! My Pad Thai tasted like Thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce. It was nasty and I am not one to consume unnecessary calories. So, I stared at my Pad Thai for the next 30 minutes as my coworker continued to consume his not-so-spectacular duck curry.    Needless to say, I'm definitely crossing Malee off my list.",

I greatly enjoy Thai and absolutely expect good atomosphere in a place as well and I got that at Malee's.   The atmosphere was better than expected. I loved the lighting (or slight lack thereof) and the different booths and tables available. My only complaint was that there happened to be a girl playing piano while we were there, but not knowing this when we arrived, we were seated in an area where we couldn't hear her at all.  The staff was very attentive and I was constantly having my water refilled without even gesturing that I needed it. This was perfect because the heat and spice of the food was exactly what I wanted :)  The unique names of the menu items were fantastic also and I kinda giggled a little bit (and still do). I had an appetizer of Siamese Kisses and a main course titled Evil Jungle Princess.   I'd definitely go back here again. It was a great experience.",

The menu was the perfect size, enough variety for most restrictions and palates, we have a varied group (from on a diet, vegetarian, peanut allergy, to eats anything). At the same time it wasn't huge and unmanageable. I had the crispy basil chicken which was flavourful as well and I tried my friends dishes which were excellent, especially the curries.  The service was as good as the food and atmosphere. We never felt rushed or ignored; neither did the waitress interrupt us. Five stars for her!

They were not that busy as we were seated right away but our server Chana V took forever to check on us during and after our meal (had he done so, we would ordered more cocktails & dessert)!  When we finally saw him we waived him over he gave us the check we paid by gift card ($100) and he told us there was only $60 left on it.   I know for a fact that it was not True as we just purchased it when you had your web sale as we do every year.  Also, we know when we use your gift cards and leave a balance the server writes down the total available on the back of the gift card) but at that point we were so disgusted, we couldn't wait to leave so we didn't even bother to dispute it.      On a positive note, the food was good and bus boy was wonderful as he made sure our water was filled and bagged up our left overs.  That is what's saving my review from a 1 star rating.",

The service, however, was far from up to par. Perhaps it was a newer server? She seemed to be trying to work from some kind of script. Our questions of her and our comments seemed to throw here completely off course. She just kept saying that it was important to them that we were happy. She probably said this to us more than a dozen times over about an hour.  I'll probably return. But it won't be with my companion. Her taste buds are hardy enough to handle \"chef hot\" and then some. So, for her, combining sub-par service with a meal that could have had even more spice (which I'd think would have excited the kitchen staff), means she'll take a pass.",

    "text": "Definitely coming back. Located in a part of Old Town Scottsdale that I don't frequent myself. Well now I have a reason to. Friendly customer service! I ordered the Crispy basil chicken which was a little too sweet for my tastes but still very good on a bed of crispy basil. The small was more than enough for me. Almost too much. I asked for medium and I really didn't get much spice. I'm kind of wimpy with spices but next time I will ask for \"hot\".  Oh what am I saying? Cause the next time I'm ordering the crispy teriyaki chicken. My Love had the Crispy Teriyaki chicken. It was waaaayyyyyyy better, IMO. So like I know most guys hate it when women do this but I ended up eating more of his than my own. Sorry, babe!!!! But it had pineapples and other goodies in there. The flavor was crazy good.  I brought the Spinach Pot appetizer home for my BFF. He loved it! He's vegan. He said the sauces were outta this world. Vegan potstickers with tofu and spinach in them and garlic on top....mmmmm, I'll try that next time.  One weird thing is that I only saw 1 bathroom stall for each gender. That couldn't be right, could it? What happens when that place is packed and people drink lots of alcohol and water while there?  Well and another thing was that rice and noodles were to be ordered as sides. While this is a good idea if you need a choice (for instance, I can't eat rice. My tummy won't digest it correctly). I'm just not used to those being extras.   Anyway, you should totally eat here if you enjoy thai food.",

We also got the pad Thai with chicken and it was super flavorful and just the right heat.

The bean thread noodle salad was good although the shrimp in it was like eating a rubber eraser (which is better than a bad shrimp) but not great. The summer rolls were pretty good although the chicken was kind of dry and the shrimp while not quite rubber eraserery had very little taste to it. The other ingredients in them were good and fresh. The hoisin sauce was really good. I also had some panang chicken. The panang was very different from other panang sauces I've had (mostly in Seattle) and I didn't really like it. I got the gf some pad thai. It also seemed really different. I had asked if it had a tamarind based sauce and was told that yes it did but it didn't taste like a tamarind based sauce to me.   Unfortunately, the food all made my stomach make weird noises. Which was not awesome.  Since we did take out, I can't comment on the service.",

We decided to have dinner before strolling around Old Town and a yelp search suggested Malee's. It was just before the dinner crowd appeared so we were seated immediately. Our visiting friend mentioned that she had never had Thai food before so we decided to order some generic but popular items and share them.The tofu pad thai was excellent; it looked like a moderate serving but appearances ca be deceiving - it was more substantial than it appeared. The Thai style chow mein was very good, with Thai herbal flavors that differentiated it from its counterpart in Chinese restaurant. The chicken satay appetizer was quite decent. The vegetable tempura dish was crispy and flavorful, though there were quite a few batter-only elements. Service was very good, as were the prices - especially considering that this is in the Old Town Scottsdale vicinity.",

The crispy basil chicken was highly recommended by a local couple next to us. The jalapeno fried rice was sticky and so flavorful. The arizona heatwave curry was a perfect mix of vegetables and broth. The tom yung soup was our only regret! Why? Because we only ordered the cup instead of the whole bowl! I had to stop eating every few seconds and say wow this is so good!!! Good thing I live 400 miles away or I'd be coming here every week! Service was on point!",

A great setting with nice scenery an art on the walls. To the sounds of a woman playing live electronic piano inside the restaurant. If you decide to come to this place there is one dish you have to try for sure. The Crispy Teriyaki Chicken here is easily one of the best things. I order two large portions every time. This way I have leftovers for the next day. The perfect combination of sweet and crispy makes the sauce with Pineapple perfection on the chicken. This sauce absolutely makes the dish my favorite thing on the menu. I guarantee you will not be mad if you order this plate.",

I had the bbq duck soup which I asked for mild because I wanted to taste the flavors first before I spiced it myself. Unfortunately, it lacked deeply in flavor so the spice rack really saved my dish. My boyfriend ordered the crispy fish which came with a salad. The salad was overly dressed and the dressing tasted like melted peanut butter. The crispy fish dish was not fully fried leaving the fish with gooey batter below the faux crispyness. Also, the sauce on the fish just tasted like the bottle sweet chili sauce was poured all over it. The service was fine up until we got our food when our server didn't come to check on us. Overall, wouldn't recommend this place and definitely wouldn't recommend it as an authentic Thai restaurant. Eh.",

Many places do it differently, the way Mexican food can be and that's great. I normally have a favorite dish at many different places. But tonight Malee's made all dishes my favorite. If I lived here I would eat here often.   I just wanted some comfort food so I started with a medium spiced drunken dragon (I think that was name) lettuce wrap, then a Tom Yum soup. Both excellent-the soup was less predictable in the best way. The main dish was the Burmese curry noodle with white fish and side sticky rice. It was amazing. Great place.",

When playing games like what if you were on a stranded island and had one cuisine to eat for the rest of your life - I generally answer \"Thai food.\"   So I've eaten a LOT of Thai. Definitely hit damn near every spot in AZ, most of them in SOCal, Denver,  and Seattle.   But hands down the best Thai Food on this coast/ mountian region is Malee's.    If I know the day that I am going to die - my last meal will be Malee's Tom Yum soup.

For us, we loved people watching (ok, we were dog and baby watching lol) as we waited for our food.   Two appies (siamese kisses and Thai hot wings) and an order of pad thai was the perfect amount for the two of us. Everything had the right amount of heat to it and my GF (who has been to Thailand) said the food tasted quite authentic.  There are so many other items I'd like to try, so I know my future trips back to Scottsdale will always include a stop into Malee's.",

    "text": "We have been going to this place for almost 20 years. We go to Malee's for every special occasion in our family. We just loved their food - especially the soup! But this time, it was a disappointment.   Both the service and food was not as good. First and foremost our waitress was stressed. She just brought the soup and put it on the table. The soup is in a unique container with real flame to keep it warm. Other waiters in all the other tables were serving the first round of soup. I noticed that and when I requested her to serve, she said \"Do you want me to do that? You are sure you don't want to serve yourselves\". They need to have consistency in the restaurant. The soup was delicious as usual. A must have at this restaurant. We were a party of 5 and the table was constricted since we had ordered lots of dishes. The waitress did not pick up the empty soup tureen and the 5 soup bowls till the end of the meal.   The food was subpar. We had requested substitution of peppers with broccoli for one of the dishes. They just removed the peppers and there was no substitute added. We had requested mild food. Some dishes were mild but the drunken noodles was so hot that our mouth burned. Our daughter ended up hardly touching the food after that bite of drunken noodles. Maybe it was not mixed well and she got a shot of hot chili.   Overall, we still love Malee's and will go back because of our happy memories of that place. I do hope this was a one time off night and they will go back to their excellent quality again.",

    "text": "Haven't been to Malee's in way too long.  We used to hit the one at Desert Ridge way back when, but don't get to Old Town Scottsdale that often.  Anyway, let's get onto what you're looking for - is it a good place to get your Thai food fix? Yes!!!    Start with the Tom Ka Gai soup - my wife's all time favorite.  Even better if you order it in the evening - because it's served in a flaming tureen.  Good visual, and GREAT flavor.  Make sure to have them tell you about the three things you may find in the soup that are for flavor, but not for eating (lemon grass, galanga root, and kaffir lime leaves, IIRC) - don't think they'd hurt you, but if you can chew them, you're a stud!  My favorite Thai dish is always the Panang curry - a spicy/sweet/wonderful red curry.  You can choose your protein (including vegetarian, if that floats your boat - I prefer beef).  The Crispy Basil Chicken is AMAZING as well.  Really great flavor!  (Off the dinner menu - it's different on the lunch menu, and not as spectacular).  If you're itching for seafood, try the Crispy Pla.  Nice local place.  Good food.  Good service.  Great pick in Old Town Scottsdale!",

    "text": "I wanted to get the story straight once and for all because I feel like the owner is hearing two completely different versions of the same story and unlike the coerced versions of the stories from the managers/kitchen, I actually have proof. On April 28, I placed an order for 2 small chicken pad thai without any bean sprouts and on my call log I placed the order at 8:42pm (which is completely different from the first lie you were told). I arrived at 8:52 because it takes me 10 minutes to get there and upon my arrival I was the only person standing right at the front desk. I wasn't helped until 9:15 which is 23 minutes of me standing there not helped nor acknowledged. Two male waiters were standing beside me the whole time and I could overhear them complaining about their customers not tipping them, while they were looking at me. Eventually a woman with glasses walked up to the front and assisted me, but she was flustered and had no idea how to properly help me. I told her that I was here for a pick up order and I watched her pace back and forth trying to figure it out.  She then hands me an order of 2 large pad thai with an extremely high price, none of which did I ever ask for, then I asked her what she charged me for and she then realizes that she took my order wrong. She then picks up the food and leaves me standing there for another 11 minutes, as noted by the time on my receipt, to which she overcharged me for by pricing each at $13.99 rather than $11.99. Due to the fact that I have been standing there so long and their lack of customer service was clearly evident, I didn't notice the pricing error until I got home at 9:36 pm. My father was the first person to notice how much they overcharged me because I had to ask him if this seemed normal and he called and spoke with one of the managers. She apologized and refunded us back the money. Then we went over to the food, and opened the box to see the most disgusting array of food. Not only was it sloppy on both, but for one of them we couldn't even distinguish what it was, the boxes were dirty and had crust along the top, and it was beyond cold all throughout each one.  I called back at 9:45 pm and we complained and voiced our frustrations and she apologized and offered us a full refund. I told her that I would be there in 15 minutes because I was beyond livid and disappointed because now we have no dinner and I wasted a lot of time and gas just to be disappointed. I arrived at 10pm and I walked right to the front desk again and guess what, I waited there for another 16 minutes not helped and unattended. What your manager conveniently left out was that a male waiter was sitting at the bar playing on his phone the entire time and he kept looking up at me and completely ignored me. Then I got tired of waiting so I had to call the restaurant that I was literally standing in to make someone hear the phone to see that I have been there the entire time at 10:16 pm. The female waitress that saw me only saw me because she heard the phone ringing and had to ask whether or not to answer it and was about to ignore me but she reluctantly helped. The manager then came up and she admitted that she couldn't distinguish what the first order was and she said that the second was pad thai but it looked as though it was just flipped over in the box. I voiced every frustration I had and even openly pointed out to her the waiters who were not cleaning and were playing on their phones AS WE WERE STILL TALKING. The fact of the matter is that this establishment needs to completely rehire better individuals because I have never gone to such a dysfunctional and untrustworthy restaurant to come and pick up my order. As some sort of consolidation your manager gave me 20 dollars to excuse the fact that they wasted my entire evening altogether. My father and I were so disappointed that we didn't even eat that night and since she felt that we needed her to give us money, I will be returning that 20 dollars back tonight because that was just disrespectful. Nothing is more insulting then when a business can't own up to their mistakes and they have to create a fake story to prove their lie. The timeline that your workers gave you was completely False and to even try to defend their behavior is inexcusable. As seen through the pictures on my review you can come up with your own belief on how the quality of your food is supposed to be as well as the level of honesty is within your staff. Why do I have to go through all of these extremities to prove my story when your staff had to lie to you to prove their's?",

It's rare that I DON'T want to go here. It's safe to say I love it. I've gone Negan (nearly vegan) since my first visit, and they will happily veganize many dishes on the menu, not just the vegetarian ones. You can sub in tofu, or veggies for meat, and skip the fish sauce. I almost always get Tom Ka Gai soup (w/tofu) because it's so darn delicious... (I think maybe they put crack in it to get you hooked?) Entrees, it's almost always a toss up btwn the savory peanut curry (amazing red curry), and the spicy panang dish (yellow curry w/kefir lime)... Both are amazing. Their veggie spring rolls are also super yummy with hoisin dipping.  They also do monthly cooking classes where you prepare dishes from the menu, and later get to eat them. Mimosas while you cook, and wine paired with lunch make it a lot of fun!",

We ordered a variety of food(coco chili fish, jalepeno fried rice, curried duck, tom yum...) It was excellent and the portions were huge. Everyone took food home. Only gave it 4 stars because their \"spicy\" wasn't spicy enough for some guests. Overall a really great experience and we'll be back soon - likely to try their happy hour specials!",

If you're a real heat junkie (Not Me!) you can ask for Chef Hot (Not Listed on the Menu).  The wait staff will probably ask you if you're sure and do be sure because it will put hair on your chest whether you're male or female.  All of the appetizers are excellent but the one that I have to have every time I go is the tom kha gai soup.  I've had good tom at other places, but at Malee's it's a signature dish.  It doesn't look like much from outside, a little hole in the wall place amongst the upscale Main St art shops.  The decor inside is fine for my taste but isn't high brow by any stretch.  The prices are very reasonable with dishes ranging from $10 to $20.",

    "text": "Malee's has a lot of charm and is located in Old Town Scottsdale, but beyond that, I found it pretty lacking in the great flavor that defines a good Thai restaurant.  I went there recently with a few friends for a birthday party. They were all impressed by the decor and very friendly waitresses, but less than enthusiastic about the prices and size of the entrees. The food appears to be more of a \"Thai inspired\" New American type place than genuine Thai. The complex, intense flavors that I generally associate with Thai food was muted, if not absent. Nothing was too adventurously spiced or interesting. Also, one of my friends is vegetarian and wanted firm rather than soft tofu. The tofu was definitely firm - it was like a tough, chewy sponge. It may have bounced if we'd dropped it on the floor, but I can't be sure...there were so few pieces in the dish that it would have been a crime to drop any for experimental purposes.  The place is really a lovely option for people who'd prefer Asian inspired dishes in a pretty, nice part of town with lots to do after dinner. For those accustomed to authentic Thai from our favorite hole in the wall places, it just doesn't quite reach high enough.",

I also tried the combo app. plate. It was so-so. Soups and veggie rolls/wraps are good because it is the only thing on the menu that isn't dripping with grease.  Overall not wowwed. GO TO CHERRY BLOSSOM, the Thai soups, noodles, sushi, fresh veggies, tofu steaks with shitake sauce, steamed shrimp shumai, daily baked bread choices (pumpkin yummm), cozy & homey atmosphere will make this place your new FAVORITE.

    "text": "Malee's is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley!  The atmosphere is much nicer than many other Thai restaurants that I've been to and the curry can't be beaten.  My favorite is the Arizona Heatwave, which I typically order \"very spicy\" with tofu.  To translate, \"very spicy\" at Malee's means that there's good flavor and spice for someone who typically likes spicier food without being so overpowering that one's mouth is simply burning so badly that the actual flavors of the food are masked.  The dinner portion is definitely quite a bit larger than the lunch portion, so if you're looking to take leftovers home, you'll want the larger size.  The tofu spinach pot stickers are also a great appetizer and are served with a variety of tasty dipping sauces.  The only real negative that I've encountered food-wise is the peanut dressing that comes on the salads by default.  It's so heavy and the salad is just drowning in dressing to the point that it's impossible to taste the salad itself.  That problem is easily remedied, however, by asking for the sesame ginger dressing which is much lighter.  While I've never attended, Malee's offers cooking classes once a month at which they provide instruction on how to make some of their signature dishes.  It sounds like fun, but my logic is why go through the trouble of cooking the food myself when I can just go to Malee's and have a great meal while someone else does the work!",

I am an annoying customer here, I always get Pad Thai and I modify the heck out of it. They get it right every single time though! A few other favorites of ours are the crab rangoon and the vegetable spring rolls...delish! My only complaint is the spice level is NOT consistent. I used to order a 3 spice level and sometimes it was so hot I literally couldn't eat the meal and sometimes it had no spice at all. I've complained a number of times about this and their answer is to order a lower spice level and ask for more spice on the side. Doesn't seem like quite the right approach to me, I feel like restaurants should be consistent. But, like they suggested, I now order a 2 with extra spice on the side. Sometimes the 2 is really spicy and I don't need it, sometimes I use all the extra spice. Overall though, we definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "Tried this place twice. Once was take out and I thought was good. I had ordered a lot of things and everything seemed good but had had a lot of wine that time so I can't remember the details.  Fast forward few months later...tried to remember where I had Thai the last time I stayed at the Phoenician. So picked this place hoping it was the one. Yes, it was because i remember the parking.   Decided to have dinner there. So the place looked cute but it was super cold. I was freezing in there. I mean it was 108 that day but the evening it cooled off. The place was cramped though. Too many tables and chairs. I couldn't imagine trying to be there during lunch hour. Anyways, the chairs are very uncomfortable and stiff.   Ordered the calamari and I thought these were perfectly crispy and salted. I should've just had this as a main dish. I had been craving shrimp so ordered the shrimp and scallops. That was good but just way too spicy and not a lot of shrimp. Also tried the garlic beef and broccoli but it was like a soup. Was disappointed with that because it seemed like it would be a stir fry like the menu described but there was so much watery sauce to the top of the bowl. Soup.  If I go out there, I would give it another go to see if the first time I had it was truly as good as I could remember. If not, will drink more wine before I eat here. Wine makes everything so much better. Lol",

The fresh ingredients, absence of oil on the top, perfect heat and beautiful clean place to eat it are all included in my rating. Service was excellent. I have eaten here multiple times and tried several specials and I am just never disappointed. Their summer rolls are fresh and tasty, I adore the basil chicken dish as well as the appetizers that I have had there. I will tell you that many things on the menu will be very different from your usual Thai restaurant. But be daring, Do you really want the same old Pad Thai? Noooo, you are in the Art District of Old Town. You are staring at $50K works of art while you are dining,,,you deserve the specials. Yes they have beer, good beer. My only issue I have ever had here, and I am not subtracting stars for it, is some dog owners walk right by your table while you eat outside and let their beloved Fido sniff your table. I can't see that to be any fault of Malee;s. That would be Snotsdale dog owners.Oops, did that slip out?",

However I give it 3 stars because...Be careful when ordering take out-make sure you check it at the restaurant. Twice now I have ordered take out and the order has been wrong. First time they put meat in my meal (I'm a vegetarian) second I had ordered the dinner curry and got a container only half full. It's annoying to get home al excited to eat your food and it be wrong. I come to the actual restaurant probably once a month and it's great! Service is fantastic and they have never messed up my order then. Just make sure to double check your take out or you will be sad when you get home.",

For a long time, I would give this restaurant a 5 star because not only was the food excellent and beautiful, the service was amazing.  But the last few times I went there, whether it was for lunch or dinner, the food was still good, but not extraordinary and the service was really substandard.  We had grown and accustomed from many years of it being awesome, to really not that great.  I've taken work friends, family, friends here for both dinner and lunches and not impressed.  For the money, you're better off going elsewhere.  I do miss the service we used to get here and we've even had birthday parties here (adults), but that didn't matter the past few times.  We now live further, and definitely not the place we would want to come to - Malee's on Main, which is what it used to be called.  Now that I'm remarried, I don't think I would want to waste our money coming here just to test it out since there are plenty of really good Thai places that have much better service along with good food.",

The food is excellent, and I appreciate how many vegetarian/vegan options they have, even being an omnivore (sometimes I just like it light, okay?).  I like that they have small and large sizes, and the lunch menu is very affordable with good portions.  You can just tell they really care about their food, and that to me, above anything else, is so important.  When I come here, I feel like what I ordered was made just for me, with care, and with pride.  The other great thing about this place is their flexibility on spiciness. Word of caution: I LOVE spicy food, so one time, like a badass, I ordered something \"Thai hot,\" or \"5/5\", or whatever it's called. Emphasize: once.  Thank god I got it to go, because I cried like a little b**** three bites in.  To be fair, the person on the phone was like, \"Are you sure?\"  Hey, fair warning's fair warning.  I ate every bite because I ordered it, and that's how I was raised, cuz there wasn't nothin' in it I didn't ask for. I was just grateful to shed my tears in the privacy of my home.  To the point- Delicious, great place for a date night, but also awesome for a nice lunch or some quick, quality take-out.  Just maybe try the 3 or 4/5 level of spiciness before you go all-in.  The one thing I will say: Malee's Thai Bistro is 5/5, hands down.",

Deirdre and Kris teach this very hands on experience and share their enthusiastic passion for Thai food.  The class is an intimate group of 10-12 (ours only had 8 as I think there were a few no shows).  The classes do book up so reserve early.  The class costs $70 per person and is worth every penny!    You start off with a welcome mimosa to start your cooking juices and then with supervised help we prepared Drunken Dragon Wrap, Tom Ka (soup), Mango Fish(my favorite), Jalapeno Fried Rice (my NEW favorite-and must have).  They take care of all the prep work and really help you learn the layering aspect of Thai cooking.  You get to sample all your dishes and take them home with you - but don't sample too much because after class you are treated to a full wine paired lunch of all the dishes on your class menu.  You will not leave hungry and you have a full to go meal of your own dishes and also a goodie bag of some Thai spices and ingredients.  Another shout out to Deirdre and Kris, all three of us came in as fond of Malee's but left as raving fans.  This is really a must do and a great gift idea.  Thank you for a wonderful afternoon!",

Crab rangoon, beef and broccoli, curry ribs, seafood curry, pad thai, and more. Everything that I could eat was very good.  I really loved those ribs and the seafood curry.  The c-food curry was the most expensive at $18.99 while everything else clocked in around $12.00 - $17.00 (ok, the crab rangoon was $8.99 which I consider expensive considering how cheap it is at Chinese take out joints).  With that many plates and people the meal was expensive at $152.80 but we all left full.  My only complaint with them was that it's Scottsdale! It was summer time! And either their AC was not on or overwhelmed and even with some over head fans and the sides open...it was not very comfy in there.  And add to it spicy food and well...a lot of water was downed.",

I care a lot more about whether or not the food is interesting enough to justify it's price tag.  At Malee's, I don't think the food is worth it.  The food isn't incredible or terrible.  Based on my experience, I'd stay away from sea food - the sea food special I would've paid $20 for (thanks, Groupon!) came out with mushy scallops and shriveled shrimp.  The sauce was tasty, though - spicy without being spicy for spicy's sake.  My date's noodle dish was pretty good.  For vegetarians, they use smoked tofu, which is a nice change up if you haven't tried it.  Still, was it worth 4 or 5 bucks more what you could pay for a similar dish at any number of Thai places that aren't in Old Town Scottsdale?  In Malee's favor, the environment is really nice.  They offer a full bar, not just beer and wine, which is a rarity for Thai places in the Valley.  They have live music some nights, which is also a great touch.  Can't really recommend this place, but can't really advocate steering people away, either.",

    "text": "Just ate here last night for a Girl's Night Out. I admit, I was uber skeptical when the bestie said Thai.  So happy I put on my big-girl-panties and went along.  I ordered the Hippy Noodles and they were FAB! The served offered the tofu smoked or fried and I went with his recommendation of fried (not my best choice).  But the rest of the dish... wow.  It was one of those meals that I once I took the first bite, I didn't look up until I had shoveled all of into my face. After finishing almost the whole plate, I was satisfied, not full or uncomfortable.  That's the great thing about it - it was light and I could enjoy more than three bites.  :)  Tasted my girlfriend's Jalepeno Fried Rice, which was also totally d-lish.  Someone else ordered the Glass-something Noodles and said they were awesome as well.  She added chicken.  The other three girls all ordered the Chow Mein, and said it was good, but no specific comments there.  It's at a great price, with an awesome & attentive staff.  The ambience is perfection and the location can't be beat.  I'm pretty excited to eat here again... just making a mental list of people I can talk into going!  :)",

Though the food is not close to authentic Thai restaurants we've had in the SF bay area which is why a 3 star...it was more an Americanized version of Thai...we had the veg red curry, pad Thai, Thai basil curry (not in menu). If in the area and craving for Thai maybe worth a visit and its a nice trendy (unlike a typical thai restaurant) ambience.",

My Dad loved the food and commented several times how that was a great meal.    We ordered Dragon Noodles, Yellow Curry for the boys, and the jalapeno fried rice.  YUMMY!!  Highly Recommend.    A little pricey but very much worth the expense.  Not an everyday lunch place in my opinion because of price but a great treat.",

Decent drink prices, food was very reasonably priced considering I was able to eat 3 times on their large portion. My comrade had a chicken dish with a red coconut curry sauce, which was also quite tasty.  Can't wait to go back and sample more of what Malee's has to offer!",

Sweet, savory, and coconutty with perfectly cooked short ribs, I had fallen in love.   As for the second time, it was not as transcendent. For some reason it just didn't hit the same flavor profile as last time. Plus I felt amazingly tired and sluggish for the next 6 hours so there's that. For now I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt but I hope this time was just an outlier.",

We order up a bunch of apps and whatever bottles of wine the bartender recommends.  The bartender alone gets 5 stars from me.  He's always chatty and remembers our preferences...not to mention he's always got the wine bottles ready for us.   On our last visit, we had the pla bites, mango spring rolls and basil chicken.  All were good, but nothing to wow me.  I'm not even sure how this place gets billed as authentic.  But hey, I guess I won't knock them.  All I can say is that Malee's serves up tasty grinds, regardless of authenticity.",

The only downside we experienced was the intense noise inside because it was Art Walk Thursday, and all the neighborhood eateries were packed.",

We had the fresh spring rolls to start with, this is a meal here but in most places might have been an app.  We liked these so much that I am going to try to recreate these for dinner at home one night.  We also had the chow Mein, which was very good!  There could have been more meat but it was still good.  I would go back to Malee's for sure!",

Milkbone's to be exact. Purchased Pad Thai and some mixed veggies and some special new dish shrimp and calamari peppercorn ....  We were starving and it still left something to be desired.  I'm sure some people will think this place is awesome and thats understandable,  I just think there are other places I will be visiting before heading back to this food.",

Malee's is always very clean, the wait staff is very courteous and the service is outstanding. I also find the prices very reasonable, considering the generous amount of food you get. Thats another great thing about Malee's, we can never finish our meals so there are always a good amount of leftovers for later!  This is not your typical hole-in-the-wall, mom & pop asian place or mongo Chinese buffet, this is a welcoming, quiet, clean little bistro in the heart of old town Scottsdale's art district. If you want a great night out, take a date to the Scottsdale Art Walk on Thursday nights, and top it off with a meal at Malee's",

If you like spicy and delicious Thai, look no further!  Lots of variety on the menu and a lot of vegetarian options or the option to make a dish veggie, which is not often found dining out.  The atmosphere was also lovely, and this place was rocking on a Friday night! Seems like I recall several large parties, so you know it's a crowd pleaser. Come prepared with cash though if dining in a large group, as it is not their policy to split checks. Since we did not come prepared, our waiter was very courteous and did split out the bill for us when requested, but I know it took some work for him behind the scenes.",
