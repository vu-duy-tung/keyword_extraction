Got there to find enchiladas ready but no tortillas.  Was told 15 to 30 minutes.  45 minutes later they were telling people 30 to 60 minutes.   This was on 12/23 and everyone was picking up orders, but to take orders in advance, then not be able to deliver shows poor planning on management's part. I will no longer depend on them for party food.",

    "text": "I was meaning to try this place some time ago and I finally have gotten to lunch here on a couple of occasions.   My first trip I had a shredded beef taco with a cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans ($5.15 with a drink, $1.15)  Very good.  On my second  trip I pigged and had an Oaxaca special burrito with mild chorizo, beans, potatoes, cheese and smothered with cheese and green enchilada sauce and a side of beans and rice ($7.25).  Everything I had was good.  They have a person assigned full time to keeping the dining and drink area cleaned and even then the lunch rush has him falling behind keeping tables ready.  This is a local family run chain of 3 locations with a lot of history in the valley.  Their tortillas made in house are really good.  While some may complain there is not a salsa bar or that the chips have a price tag on them their pricing structure has a lot of merit in that you can order what you want and pay only for that and nothing you may not wish to consume.  In that sense it can be a really inexpensive place to eat.  While I would not consider this a destination place it is certainly a good value if you are in the area.  And based on the crowds that fill the place I am not alone in that idea.",

The portions may not be to your liking, and if that's the case you are most likely morbidly obese and need to control your appetite before you have a cardiac arrest.  If your thoughts are that \"there isn't much flavor\" then go eat Top Ramen or something because you don't know Mexican food.  This place is exactly what Mexican food is meant to be. Simple, spicy, filling and HOT. The folks behind the counter are pleasant, the operation is efficient and the food is really good.",

Even though they were very busy, it took only about 12 minutes to get my food. The staff were all smiling. Even the prep cooks in the back. You hardly ever see that in restaurants.   I got my burro to go and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. It cost about $4.50 and for the price the quality was pretty good. Limited garnishes though. You are limited to a mild red salsa, some dried herbs and tired looking diced green onions.  Great for a tasty quick lunch. Don't go if you are trying to find the best Mexican food in town. It is good but not South Phoenix taco truck good. They are perfect for a grab and go on the way to a family event though.",

The salsa dispensers are almost always empty.  The trash is always overflowing.  There is always food all over the floor and tables.  There are dirty rags left out on top of tables and trash cans.  And the ice machine is almost always empty.    I even took the time to write the manager about these unacceptable conditions after seeing them over and over and was replied with \"There was a new guy on the trash cans and a manager called out.\"  They obviously don't care about customer satisfaction or keeping a clean environment.    Looking at the other reviews I know I am not alone on this.  The Cave Creek and Cactus restaurant is just as busy but still manages to keep their salsa jugs full, ice full, trash taken out, and floors fairly clean.  I am okay with eating on paper plates and plastic untensils but I am not okay with eating at a dump.  The next time I return if it is in the same condition I am taking a picture and sending it to a health inspector.    Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable!",

Mexican food is just as diverse as the languages and dialects that reside within Mexico. I grew in a border town. This is as close to THAT type of Mexican food as I have ever found, anywhere. The hot sauce.. not salsa..hot sauce is right on the money. If I had to guess, I'd have to attribute it to the use of Mexican oregano as opposed to oregano usually found in Italian dishes.  This is the best menudo that I have found anywhere. The red chile is fantastic. The green chile is awesome. I have never been disappointed.    I have seen it be a little dirty. They could be more diligent about wiping table and making sure that garbage bins get emptied. But nothing worse than you will see at any fast food place with high volume.    Yes, they do holler your order number out when it is ready.. and her voice cuts through that place like fingernails on a chalkboard... it's not abuelo's.",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night instead of our usual Caramba's because the hubby said he loved it. We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit.   After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs.   Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street! ( We also spent at least $10 more!, more reason to go to Caramba's!)",

While ordering 3 quarts of bean, 2 dozen tortillas and 12 tacos it's pretty obvious that I'm not going to eat it there.  When we ask for a container to put some hot sauce in the answer is we can sell you some if you want a larger container.  So off to the salsa station and fill up 10 or 15 of the little salsa cups and try to balance them going out the door.  You would think with an order like that and the amount it cost they would accommodate you with a container of salsa.  I guess when your food is that good and you are packed all the time you don't have to worry about customer service.",

First box checked. Maybe double checked! 2. The accompanying red or green sauces have to stand apart for some reason. The red sauce here is as good as I've ever had. Heavy garlic and oregano seem to be the key factors. 3. The chorizo must be cooked correctly so you don't receive a pork fat facial when you take your first bite. Again, box checked!!!  Carolina's is an icon in the valley of the sun and you need to find any excuse necessary to make it in for a breakfast burrito. I'm sure everything else is great too.",

You can get salsa out of the dispenser by the soda machine. Sometimes people are very messy and the staff is obviously that is a mess by the salsa. Cant really blame them, the are usually super busy. It is usually packed. Here is a tip....if you want your food faster.  Place a to go order via the phone. You pick up your food same place on orders do. Only you cut out waiting in line and longer for your food.   All in all good place.",

I would give more stars if there cashiers put on a smile rather than rush you through the line to order, which is always long. I've been here several times and never have they been nice or look you in the eyes when you order.",

My daughter used to get the chicken burritos up until they changed the chicken recipe now I have to go when she is really craving a chimi because then she won't eat :( but other than that the food is super delicious it's always packed not just at lunch hour so be prepared to wait a while for your food but it's worth it .",

The green chili wasn't too spicy and needed more acidity because I didn't taste any lime either. I probably wouldn't go back here but my mom enjoys their food so we may try it again just in case it was just a bad day.",

    "text": "I am tempted to give 5 stars because they have good prices. In terms of food I'd say that their tortillas are good it's what makes their burritos worth eating. Their machaca burrito was good, their red chili burrito was good, but I wasn't a fan of the green chili burrito.   I can't recall ever having a green chili burrito that was as gelatinous, it was almost like a gravy which in itself isn't bad - but is when it's more gravy than meat. I'd say it's more of a gravy burrito then green chili burrito. My idea of green chili burrito is one you'd get at St. Mary's tortilla factory in Tucson (which also has way better red chili burritos too lol but I digress).  All I've eaten are the burritos here which I would say overall are good. While their prices are good it's not mega cheap...just cheap..because I eat quite a bit and I need 2 burritos to make a dent while in Tucson I can go to BK's and get full off one and it's about the same price. But still it's priced very reasonably (I lived in california for a bit and I'd say these sized burritos would be like 6 bucks while a burrito like one at BKs might be 9.50)  I shall update when I have the litmus test - carne asada. I don't expect it to be as good as BKs because I don't smell mesquite grilling the meat but maybe they use good spices - keeping an open mind lol.",

The response I got was \"you didn't get those already?\" I showed the employee my receipt and shortly after received my food. Not having the best confidence in them I checked the containers and saw I didn't receive my fluatas, but instead got beans and chili. I was glad I checked before I left.

First of all it is overpriced and I believe the original owner's children have become greedy or they convinced the owner to raise the prices.  I could not believe the egg and potato burrito is $4.50 with no cheese and it is small, WHAT A RIPOFF!  It tastes horrible like they mashed the potatoes a little or got it from a boxed mashed potato mix then added a few pieces of diced not chopped potatoes and a couple of eggs with beef fat.  I am an ovo-vegetarian and I do know what beef fat tastes like.  I talked to a recent customer and told him I had been away almost 2 years and couldn't believe the price and quality of the burritos are very poor, and he said, \"it's worth it\".  Ha, what a joke!  I'm not coming back but i am definitely not going to keep my mouth shut.  If you want a good egg and potato burrito, it is better to make it.  There are too many restaurants overpricing and the quality is so poor.  They use to make good, quality burritos and a fair price.  They sure got the customers fooled.",

Carolinas is my go to place every time I'm craving Mexican food because you guys know exactly how to do it! The one and only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of this one incident today. The first time I've ever had even the slightest issue. I bit into my delicious amazing burrito and was stabbed in the mouth by something that I've discovered is one of those goat head thorns that grow outside. I don't want to jump to conclusions, I'm just not exactly sure how one of those things ended up in my burrito and it definitely didn't feel very good stabbing me in the gums. I know this is just a one time mistake and I'm not holding it against you guys, but I definitely think it's something you might want to look into. Maybe just a little clarity on how it ended up in my burrito?",

I had a green corn tamale and my hubby had a #3 combo that included a taco, tostada and enchilada with rice and beans.   There is limited seating so while I was in line he went and found us a seat. It took quite a while for our food to come out. My tamale was good although there was more masa than meat. It did have good flavor though. Hubby really liked everything except the red sauce on the enchilada. It almost tasted like someone dumped a bunch of red chili in the pot and didn't finish cooking it. I would definitely not order anything with that sauce on it again. The beans and rice were very good.",

The enchilada was simmilar with only 1/2 with cheese and sauce strewn across the foam container. To complete the disaster the taco was broken in three sections and covered with lettuce to hide the mess. It might have been a one time mistake or a new cook and I will try again as I always enjoyed the original location and like this location.",

Not only is the food some of the best mexican at a fast food place (not a pick up but made to order) so you should expect to wait a while. As for the service, have you ever thought that you get what you give?. Try a smile and a pleasantry instead of grouching. We have been going to Peoria,s Carolinas since they opened and only once have I seen a male at the cash registers, it is always girls. I have never heard anyone be rude or abrasive to a customer. It makes a person wonder what the complainers expect, if you want waiter service, do you go to McDonalds?",

I had some friends raving about their tortillas and talking about how they are the only ones they will use anymore, so of course my interest was peaked.  This combined with all the rave reviews and me and the husband decided to take the short trip this past Wednesday.  The locations was clean, and the employees were polite. The menu is extensive so I caved and went with the number 9 since it had rave reviews in a previous review. The beans and rice were very tasty and the tacos tasted better than any other \"taco stand\" joint I have been to and best of all were not loaded with grease. The tortillas used in the tacos were thin and crunchy and boy did the NOT skip on the cheese. The husband ordered a chimichunga and he was pleased to find out  that it was only chicken inside (he has texture issues with onions and chilis) and he was over the moon with the \"non chunky\" salsa with a good kick to it. We tried a cheese tortilla (once again not super greasy at all) and a buttered tortilla. Next time we would do either a cheese tortilla or the chips, not both. We really did end up over ordering but for under $20 and lunch for the hubs the next day we really couldn't complain.  We will be back, soon I hope. This is definitely on the guilty pleasure list.",

Firstly, I didn't know what to expect because the place looks fast foody, but once you get your amazing food in front of you it's like the rays of heaven come down and shine on their tacos, anything weird or whatever about the place disappears.  The chicken taco was A-Maz-In!!!! Stuffed with chicken, lots of cheese, pour some of their salsa on it... oh dear, I've gotten overexcited. :) I had a taco and two tamales, which weren't the greatest honestly, but I've eaten fresh homemade tamales most of my life so I'm a bit spoiled. They were made with beef instead of pork (my favorito), but the beef was good, just not my cup of tea. From what I understand, they don't serve any pork there which is just bummer but eh, their chicken is pretty good.  I also had a bite of my friends red chili chicken burrito and was instantly jealous I didn't get one of those too. :(   Let me say, they bought a package of their freshly made giant tortillas and...shudder. They were absolutely perfection. So yummy in the morning with melted cheese on them.  I really liked this place and will definitely go back next time I'm in Phoenix.",

I ordered a burrito with beans, cheese, green chile and eggs.  I opened it to devour and the tortilla was so sopped with moisture that it completed fell apart.  I ate it as I could.  The potatoes tasted like the ones you get in the can, the eggs were watery and the beans weren't there.  Someone behind the counter charged me extra but failed to follow through.  I will say that their tortilla with butter is good - but what ISN'T good when drenched in butter.  For good tortillas, go downtown to Glendale and go to La Purisima...don't waste your time with Carolinas.",

We ordered enchiladas a side of beans...the beans were wonderful, but the enchiladas were horrible. They used to put them into a metal container and serve them smothered in enchilada sauce and melted cheese. I don't know if they were out of these containers or just trying something new but they served the enchiladas cold in a Styrofoam container. The cheese was unmelted, cold and really ruined our meal.",

But I get it -- if it's crowded, it's good...something MUST be good for people to wait in line to eat in and for those waiting to pick up their takeout order. We must not have ordered the THING that everyone was waiting for. Maybe better staffing would help move things along!

    "text": "Carolina's dining area has always been just one step below nasty with delays in cleaning tables and over flowing trash bins.  One tended to overlook hygiene given the former \"home-made\" aspect of their menu.  That has changed over the years, the popularity of the franchise now driving mass-produced Mexican fare that's maybe a notch higher than Taco Bell.  So I was always willing to kick in an extra three bucks or so more than fast food Mexican.  Alas, they have now changed the menu to ala carte and think themselves clever that the customer does not notice their jacked up prices.  I can dine at any number of good sit down Mexican restaurants in my area for about the same price....and without the long waits and having to bus my own table.  Bye Carolina's!  Like that Greek fella that flew too close to the sun with his wax wings, your arrogance and menu pricing manipulations will someday do you in.  Name me another Mexican restaurant that abandoned their combo offerings and I'll name you a business that went under.  Bye!",

But when it's 8:00 and you still have 5 people in line and half of your dining area is closed because it's been cleaned for the night you have got to be kidding. I'm all for trying to not stay late after a long day but your still a busy restaurant and have customers. 2 trash cans were closed because they had been emptied the other 2 were overflowing. It's not how you run a business. I hope management takes note and realizes when your open till 9, it's 9, not 8:15.",

    "text": "Happened to be in the area on other business and decided to try this place out. The wife had heard about it and knew of one location in Tempe, I guess? So she was pretty excited to know that Carolinas was just a short drive away from where we happened to be. I have to admit being a little hesitant after seeing the pictures on Yelp (which didn't exactly make it out to be any sort of haute cuisine establishment), but then again if there's anything Juanitas III in Ontario, CA (look up my review of it) has taught me, it's that you should never judge a burrito joint by the cover. So in we went.  The kitchen and counter area were well-enough lit, I guess. Rest of the place was really dark. First thing we saw were flies buzzing around the counter and the staff seeming to not pay attention to them at all. Shitloads of corn chips in bags and a decent selection of Mex fare at acceptably low prices. I got the enchilada trio - beef, chicken and machaca. Wife got a burrito and a taco, and the kid got a mini bean burro.  We found a table amidst a good number of fat, happy Mexican (I assumed) patrons and sat down to wait for our number to be called. It was ready predictably quick and came with a bag of corn chips that I'd give about 70 on the corn chip scale, along with decently hot red and green salsa. I had asked for a side of jalapenos, which I got - but they were fresh, not pickled. I kinda wanted pickled, so my bad for not specifying that.  And then the food was ready. I was starving so I wolfed mine down. It wasn't too bad, but it wasn't a *gigantic* portion and to be perfectly honest it all tasted much the same, with the only differentiating factor being the texture of each protein. More corn chips went down the hatch. The kid liked his meal and finished the entire burro, most of the refried beans (a bean burro served with a side of beans. niiiice.) and most of the rice. I tried some rice and liked it, but it wasn't anything better than Knorr spanish rice that you could make at home. And the wife liked her meal. Not spectacular. Just regular, boring Mexican food that you could get anywhere. Though she DID go back and buy some tortillas, which I expect would taste exactly like store-bought Mission ones.  High points: Nothing particularly standout, really. It was edible, had flavour and several hours later I don't appear to be suffering any sort of Montezuma's revenge so there's a good chance none of my food was on the ground at any point before being served to me, as I often imagine to be the case with most other Mexican restaurants (which is why I eat at them so damn rarely). Good prices, $23 for a decent whack of food. Tomorrow morning I'm expecting to need to shit over a strainer so I can catch any stray intestines that might prolapse out, but I'm good so far this evening.  Low points: Flies. Dark and dingy interior. Being surreptitiously glanced at from time to time because I have a white wife. Or perhaps because we were speaking English. Who knows? And as for the patronage - Pita Jungle this ain't.  Anyway, the quest for a local alternative to Juanita's continues. Probably won't come back here, not because it was a horrible experience but simply because this quality of food is served at every single star-dot-Bertos in the Southwest and I don't need to drive all the way from Scottsdale to get it on the very VERY infrequent occasions I actually want it. In fact, I usually just go to Del Taco in those cases. Because they have fries!  Three stars, but.. yeah. I probably won't return (not their fault).  Edit: Well, it's the next day. And my morning poop didn't turn my balloon knot into a chrysanthemum (phew!), so we'll go ahead and leave this here review at three stars. Review concluded.",

My favorite is the red, green, and bean properly named the Three Way Burrito. WARNING!! You must get this burrito double wrapped. If not, you WILL have a blowout and a big mess on your shirt, lap, or your plate if you're lucky. The beans are wonderfully smooth with a nice authentic pork flavor. Being a bit of a Mexican Rice (NOT Spanish Rice) connoisseur I can tell they use some of the broth in their rice from one of their simmering meats. Getting little bits of the mirepoix in the rice from the slow and low broth is a nice treat. The Red Beef Tamales are like Nana used to make. magnifico! I recommend the enchilada style tamale if you really want to satisfy your taste buds. The Salsa is of course a staple in the valley and is no doubt tasty. I have noticed recently they've been using pre-shredded cheese instead of shredding it themselves. Oh well, everything else has been up to par so we'll continue to make this regular stop.",

I don't know what they use to keep there flour tortillas so fresh for so long (there just great by themselves) I always buy a dozen or more for home use, there great to roll scrambled egg & sausage in and don't forget to buy extra hot sauce...oh boy is it good!

The reality of this place: It doesn't seem like anyone pays much attention to cleanliness. The two (2) times that I did dine in were enough. Food left on tables for over an hour; workers handling food after mopping (granted it was their own food, but if they do it to their own food...); and trash on the floors.   All-in-all: The food is great, but the facility is a dump. Do yourself a favor and get takeout.",

I always get at least a dozen tortillas to take home and some of their enchilada sauce as well.  My go-to is to get a bean burrito (sometimes double wrapped because the tortilla is the best part) and a couple of hard shredded beef tacos.  The taco sauce they make here is very good as well - but it can be a little too spicy for some people (not me!)  The only thing here that isn't too good is the cheese enchilada.  Stick with the burros and tacos.  I would eat here every day if I could... but then I'd weigh like 780 pounds and be dead by 45.",

I met a girlfriend from high school here for dinner at her suggestion and since I love Mexican food and had such a lame experience at Caramba's I jumped at the chance. I ordered my typical test drive meal at a new place. 2 crunchy tacos one shredded beef, one shredded chicken with refried beans, rice and a small side of guacamole. Our food was ready quickly, and my tacos were wonderful. Both of them were great as was the just fried little grease dripping taco shell. The beans were tasty and the rice was great and luckily had no carrots or peas. The guacamole was average.   This is not fine dining. This is not fancy. This is really good freshly made food and I will be back hopefully next month when I am back in town.",

    "text": "Ok, everyone I know says the food is so good here.. People had me very much intrigued to try out this Mexican restaurant. It was crowded, good sign of good food right? Diverse crowd also told me that it was good food too. The cashier was very friendly and seemed overwhelmed by all the people in the line. I waited for a table and spoke with a couple who literally eats at this restaurant each time they drive in from Flagstaff as this is one of their favorite spots in the valley! Again, boosting my excitement for the food! So, after about twenty minutes of listening to the people announcing the number of the orders over the intercoms ( omg so flipping loud) that was ridiculous- they need to turn it down and teach etiquette to not yell into a microphone! Finally- my food is ready! I was surprised that my tamales had no meat! Like zip! I didn't even know what or how I ended up with tamales with literally corn in it?! I've never ever seen that in my life! The person I was with said how great the rice was- so I took a bite, and it was dry. I mixed the rice up with the beans and ta-da! Good! The beans were good and honestly the other meal on the table looked so much better than my vegetarian tamales! ( I didn't know that I ordered meatless tamales) However, three stars because Gesh apparently the tortillas are great, and I just didn't get to experience it. My suggestion is if you want some meat in your tamales, make sure you make it clear when you order otherwise it's corny!",

I'm not sure I would even go as far as calling it a Resturuant, it's more so fast food type joint. So you can't expect all the bells and whistles.   What you can expect is good food and who cares about the rest as long as your appetite is satisfied! It's a busy location so the staff is always trying to do their best at keeping up with the line and getting orders out. I've even used their catering on two separate occasions and was still very pleased. So if you want some authentic Mexican food, I doubt Carolina's will disappoint.

The food was under seasoned, and the drink and condiment station was a huge mess. I ordered enchiladas as I opted out of the tamales, originally we had wanted to order the Menudo, but they only served it in the mornings of Saturday (we were here on Saturday night) so... hm.

Both locations I have visited offer stellar tortillas! Thanks for being consistent!   I had my usual Machaca (shredded beef with onions, chilies & spices) Burrito with Papas (potatoes) :P You gotta try one the beef is tender and juicy but not sloppy wet. It is seasoned to perfection with just a mild heat. The potatoes just add another dimension of deliciousness!  My friend had the chicken burrito I tried it but did care for it. The chicken is a mix of white and dark meat and it was on the dry side. She put a ton of hot sauce on it. Also she said she thought it may be better mixed with beans and cheese.   I will see you soon Carolina!",

    "text": "I think I'm in trouble. A Carolina's 5 minutes from my office in Peoria. I didn't realize this was the same Carolina's as the restaurant in Downtown Phoenix until this week, so I introduced the delicious, affordable, Mexican fare to my coworker.   Compared to their original Phoenix location, this location is much more comfortable and clean. Although I appreciate the \"taco stand\" feel of the Phoenix location, the West restaurant is newer, cleaner, and a bit more welcoming.   I overdid it on the ordering. I over-ordered. I was so excited I couldn't help it! I tried the green corn tamale, a chicken enchilada, and a soft chicken taco. I ate half of everything and was stuffed and saved the rest for dinner. I enjoyed the tamale the most. The size was good too - I'm sure most would say it was a bit on the small size, but I liked that it wasn't huge. My coworker ordered the chips to start and they were awesome. The salsa isn't chunky, but it's spicy and delicious.   What else can I say?! Good cheap, fast, authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for a light, low-cal lunch, this isn't it.   I have to mention the tortillas. I ordered a dozen to take home. I didn't realize they were close to 18\" in diameter. I sure hope they freeze well. Carolina's claims they have the best tortillas - and I agree.   The only things I didn't care too much for is the excessive amount of Styrofoam used and the fact that my hair smelled like corn tortillas the rest of the day. :)    Simple, delicious, authentic. Carolina's will not disappoint.",

This food is some of the best Mexican food I've had. They make homemade tortillas, and chips, and tamales, and, well..EVERYTHING!   I love their shredded beef chimichanga, and their refried beans are to die for. Everything, actually, is terrific here. The FLAVORS are incredioble, the meat spicy and frangrant - the beans creamy and rich. Oh, it's like the Mexican Food equivalent of hearing Colin Firth swear undying love in \"Pride and Prejudice\"...you never tire of it.....well, except maybe the flies....  We make the drive to Carolina's because it's great and we always take someting home \"For later\" like chips or tortillas. Their homemade goodness can NOT be beat by any other \"quick mex\" place. Carolina's kicks the ass of all the \"Ass Burrito\" places in the Valley - (and you know who you are- all you \"BERTO\" places!!)  The only thinkg I would recommend to our friends at Carolina's is perhaps a fly strip or two.",

The service is FAST & friendly. You wait in line for the next available cashier....usually just one person. If it's busy, there are two cashiers (CASH ONLY).  Of course, some patrons must be so impatient that they decide to stand right NEXT to you at the register as you are paying. (HELLO! How about alittle personal space here, lady!)  The line, which was all the way to the door  (3pm on Saturday) moved very quickly. You wait off to the side with the other customers until they call your number.  The portions are plentiful and prices are cheap!   Next to the soda station, you'll find plastic wrapped forks, spoons, and knives...and their AWESOME hot sauce. You pump the hot sauce into small 1oz containers...mmmm! This stuff is so addicting--you'll want to eat a handful of Altoid mints or you'll have Mexican food breath all day.  Be sure to order some of their flour tortillas! Man, these things are like the size of an automobile tire! HUGE...and delicious!  I think I've just talked myself into going there AGAIN today!",

Filiberto's and Federico's have always been my favorites in Phoenix but Carolina's blows Filiberto's and Federico's almost out of the water...Almost.   Their slogan is something along the lines of \"Best tortillas in town\" and they are correct. Growing up my mom would always take trips to Tucson to get the hand-made flower tortillas and I thought those were the best things since Capri-Sun pouches but even Carolina's even gives those a challenge for my favorite tortilla.   The burritos are what you expect, just as they say on the menu, but they taste fresher than other fast Mexican food and their chorizo is some of the best I have had in the valley (Next to my Mom's).  My only complaint is that the horchata and hibiscus tea (Jamaica) is from a generic company and you can tell in the taste.   The inside is also very nice for a fast-food place and is very clean...That's always a major plus. If you think you love Mexican food, you must try this place.",

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's the same weirdness as the generic Mexican joint housed in what was clearly a Pizza Hut once upon a time.  Onto the food.  I had heard all sorts of amazing things about the other Carolina's, so maybe I was setting the bar too high, but I wasn't super impressed.  To me it's just average Mexican food, nothing spectacular and maybe even a bit too greasy.  Also, I know this is more of a fast food location and less of a restaurant, but it just seems odd to go to a Mexican food eatery that does not give you chips and salsa at the table.  Like an Italian place with no bread.  (Did Fazoli's serve bread?)  My biggest beef with this place is the food containers.  Styrofoam city!  It's like McDonald's in the '80s over there.  We've always eaten there yet they always box the food up like it's to-go.  Piles and piles of cups and containers fill the garbage cans, which are probably emptied a staggering amount of times per day.  Yuck.  Overall, I'm giving this place an \"eh\" three stars.  Not really worth it for me to drive through the goofy, wiggly part of downtown Peoria to get to.",

Ok Chimi's...excellent, chips homemade, salsa good (some might not like it because it is a real saucy kind, not chunky), rolled tacos good, Burritos excellent, haven't tried the tacos yet, red enchilada's were excellent as well.  Thank god Fazolis went out of business so Carolina's could move in!  Well it is time to hit a fine dining adventure, because I will not find a cheap eats like this one anytime soon!  Ok tried the taco's mucho good!  The only thing I don't like is the taco salads, just not my style of taco salads.  Oh butter tortillas...yum yum yum!!!",

    "text": "If I could give this place no stars I would.  Worst Mexican food I've ever had.  While ordering a carne asada burrito I asked what came on it... apparently only carne asada and pico... had to add guacamole.  The place seemed busy but now I have no clue why... the burrito was as small as a taco bell burrito and honestly taco bell tastes better!  The carne asada was dry and over seasoned and had a very small spoonful of guacamole and I got charged 90 for it.  Ridiculous.  I was still hungry after and that's never the case at real Mexican taco shops. I'll never go back.  I may be spoiled on San Diego taco shops but even Filbertos is a gazillion times better than this place... what a joke.  Oh I forgot to mention how annoying the lady was calling out orders... I'm disabled so it takes me longer than 3 seconds to walk up to pick up my tray she just kept yelling my order number out.  I don't understand why this place has so many good reviews.. these people obviously don't know what good Mexican food is.",

People give this place bad reviews for napkins being on the floor. With a crowd as big as they get during lunch and dinner would you really want them to slow down on getting out orders or pick up a few dropped napkins. And most 'authentic' Mexican food places do call your number over the speaker. (ie Carrumbas???) how else are you supposed to hear when they call your order with a crowd that large? If want Tex Mex (not authentic) go somewhere else. We love this place. Servers are nice food is excellent local and family owned traditional Mexican food. We love you Carolinas!!",

Carolina's was able to fit my order in when they usually ask for a 24 hour notice and I gave them a 90 minute notice! When I arrived to pick up my platters the restaurant was BUSY!! The girl behind the counter greeted me promptly, chatted and joked with me while they were packing up my order ,then carried and placed the food in my car for me. I didn't have to lift a finger! I had ordered one chicken and one beef taco platter, a full tray of chicken enchiladas, and a full tray of rice and beans. This also included chips and salsa. Everything was delicious, everyone in the office enjoyed the food and went for seconds. I did not have any complaints and all my coworkers wanted to know where I ordered the food from... Thank you Carolina's for providing my office with great food under such a short notice, with friendly customer service. I will be back!",

So after a few of those I tried the red chile burrito... Again I loved it. Probably the last few months that has been my go to at least 2xs a week. But now (the last 3 or 4 xs) they have cut how much meat they put in it. And while I'm a fan of the sauce and the tortilla, Its just a large wet tortilla without the meat... Again Yuk! Last night was the last time for us. I wish I had taken a pic of it. The tortillas are huge , there was more than enough sauce and maybe 10 small pieces of meat. Really? That meat didn't fill 1/4 of the burrito !! I think we're done.",

The only way to tell the difference was finding the maize from a Tamale. As for the rice, I never knew Spanish Rice was supposed to be crunchy and undercooked.... Just over all a let down.

However, the hard shell chicken taco is very good. The cheese enchiladas are good but not great. I have had the chorizo and potato burrito and it is good,  but Ramiro's and Senor Taco do it better.   This was my second visit, first time i could not rate them because they did not have green salsa. This time they did and I give that 4 stars. But, they guy behind the counter acted like they are doing us all some kind of favor by selling it \"Oh, your lucky today, we have green salsa\". I guess they run out-proof was my first visit- but while it is good, I am not dying to put it on everything, so it is not that good. El Paisano in El Mirage is a carneceria that has the BOMB green salsa.   Why three stars-no carnitas or asada and the tortillas, well the are good but I don't crave them.  I may be a guera ( I am the gringa that speaks spanish and busts all the cabrons talking shit) but let me tell you, I grew up in a Mexican family in Hatch, NM/Las Cruces/El Paso area and have had some spectacular tortillas and these don't even come close.",

Yes, this is a fast food environment, yes they serve the food on paper plates, yes you bus your own table etc. etc. Who cares? Does everything have to be Durant's? The fact is, they do Mexican basics better than just about anyone.   I had shredded beef tacos and a single chicken soft taco. Both were the best in their class I have had in my life--including those I've had on trips to Mexico. The hard shell is done in a similar style to what you would find at Filiberto's The soft taco, well, is was a soft taco, but made with Carolina's famous tortillas. Both were a perfect combination of spice, meat, and cheese, with the usual lettuce thrown on as an after thought. The salsa you get out of the little pumps by the soda fountain was also very good.   Housed in an old Fazoli's or Pizza Hut or something, the atmosphere and appearance is similar to one of the newer Filiberto's, but the food sets it apart from the rest.   Oh, and it is cheap.

I had never tried a buttered or cheese tortilla until a co-worker ordered a few...very addicting.  They only have one salsa which is not fiery but has a kick, and their chicken burritos are just that, chicken and a tortilla.  No Chipotle style faire here.

I will never come here again  and only came here after getting a gift card. I ordered the mini chimichanga combo and my husband ordered a carne asada burrito. We decided to be thankful and eat our food but we really struggled finishing this. The chicken in my chimi tasted like canned chicken and tasted and looked it was boiled with no flavor. The beef had no flavor and the texture of it was chewed up beef. The cheese they grated on everything tasted as if it had sat out in the fridge too long and absorbed that fridge odor. The beans were runny with no flavor and I have used canned beans before and they've tasted better. The rice tasted moldy. I wonder if they're using old food or preparing too fast in advance and not keeping anything fresh. The horchata was powdery - I'm not sure what the exact texture should be for this but I've had many and none tasted like this. My husband said his burrito was very plain with no flavor. Im shocked because it was pretty busy when I came so there are some that definitely enjoy it! Not for us though. Nice service for sure though. Another thing - I didn't know you could go wrong with guac but they sure did unfortunately. The food needs to be refrigerated but fresh definitely isn't a concern. I usually don't mind if my food takes long if it's good and fresh but this food came out in 5 minutes and tasted worse. Sorry Carolina's.",

I ordered the chicken mini chimi's that come with rice and beans. Y'all, there was a rock...I repeat, a rock in the second mini chimi I attempted to eat. It wasn't a bone, it wasn't burnt tortilla, it was a straight up rock. I have no clue how a rock gets in with shredded chicken ??? but it did. Since I obviously didn't know that there was a rock in my mini chimi I wasn't chewing on it gingerly. I wasn't expecting a foreign object to almost break my teeth out of my head. Needless to say, I was quite surprised and my molars hurt. I guess the human bite force is pretty strong because I broke the rock into two larger chunks and two small shards. I called the restaurant to inform them about the rock and at first either they didn't understand or they didn't think I was serious. After repeating myself and telling them that I'm lucky to still have teeth they said, \"oh! Okay?\". They didn't offer to do anything which I'm fine with. I wasn't looking for a free meal. If I had lost any teeth though, I would definitely have taken it further. Moral of the story...always chew your food as if it might have rocks in it. It will save your teeth and jaw from feeling like mine do right now.",

Once inside you walk up to the  order windows  and select your entree from a large menu.    As you wait for your entree to arrive you can hear staff calling out order numbers. Once our number was called we made our way up front grabbed our plates and asked for some salsa, that is  available in small paper cups filled by big stainless steel dispensers.  The hard-shell machaca burrito, rice and beans, horchata and tortillas were just okay. However, I found the cheese enchiladas to be mediocre (tortillas are hard, very little cheese).  The meal just wasn't very good.  It might be a while before I decide to re-visit Carolina's.",

Then she lies to my niece and says she told her over the phone only 2 tacos would be refunded. We wouldn't have driven over there after hours for that amount.  It's disgusting to find hair in your food 2x but then the poor customer service is just too much! Any other professional would have refunded all the money for food and the inconvenience of driving over there.

We had 18 people there so it should have been plenty, but because several people stayed for quite a while after the shower ended and they kept eating, there was virtually nothing left! It made the clean up a breeze, but no leftovers for Sunday.  A wedding planner friend of my daughter's recommended Carolina's and I'm so glad she did!!! We have found our new favorite Mexican restaurant!!!",

    "text": "Love Carolinas!  Been to the one on Cactus a handful of times and have been incredibly impressed with their beef tacos.  Have been to this one a handful of times and have had pretty good meals.  While not as good as the Cactus location (Still haven't been to the OG one downtown), their beef tacos were still good.  I was telling my wife how good they were and decided to come down here and show her what was up!    We placed our order for a combo #9, 4 shredded beef tacos, and a beef flauta for my son.  Total came out to $18.47.  Swiped my card, signed the receipt, got our salsas, waters etc and sat down.  A few minutes later, the food was ready.  My wife thought the beef tacos were just ok (she prefers other places like Lolitas, Fredericos etc).  Mine were as good as the Peoria location can be (still not as good as Cactus) .  My son ate a little bit of the beef flauta.  Meal completed, left, and everything was good.  Everything sounds great so far, right?  Well, it was....until I looked at my bank statement.  My bank statement showed a pending transaction from Carolinas for $23.47.  I thought it might have been an error, and it was pending for a good 4 days.  Know what though?  It cleared my account!  Someone added on $5.00 to my bill!  That is small enough for a lot of people not to notice, but that is also bullshit and will not fly with me.  I called my bank and they immediately refunded the money into my account.  They told me that if the merchant disputed it, I may see a charge back to my account (Which is what should have happened in the first place...I should have been charged $18.47 for the food I ordered!).    Anyways....I will be leery to come back here.  Ill take the drive to the Cactus location instead.  If there is a slim chance I do come back here to the Peoria one, I will most definitely be paying in CASH!  Watch your receipts at this place if you pay with your card!",

I thought the two extra dollars for shredded lettuce with a dab of beans and a dab of rice was a little high, but next time I got another one.  The three way burrito combo has both red and green chili.  Because of the taste, I'm giving them all five stars.   There's a large selection of soft drinks, including different flavors of  horchata.  The apple chimis and chocolate chimis are rich, hot and tasty.      I have been given to believe that if the tortillas were cooked slightly longer, the burritos wouldn't disintegrate.  Every single burrito falls apart before you can finish it, so be sure to grab a fork or, even better, a spoon, so you can spoon up the sauce when you rescue the burrito bits that fall  into your food box.   And thank you, Carolina's, for the individually wrapped forks, spoons and knives, because I like to know my cutlery is clean!",

I've figured out that this place is more expensive than I thought because you simply can't fill up on just one item.  It's nice that the burrito is only $3.25 or so, but it's not enough for a hungry adult - add your tostada, chips/salsa, taco, soda pop, etc. and you're easily approaching $10.",

I've also tried the red & green chili which are really good too. I have nothing bad to say about this place just go and try it NOW!",

    "text": "Are you kidding?! My first visit to Carolina's was divine! I live most of the year in Seattle dreaming about great Mexican food... This trip, I found what I was looking for at Carolinas. I'd read about the restaurants in several magazines and finally made it to the west location.   My family and I sampled several dishes. The highlight being the enchilada sauce and tamales (red and green). I also enjoyed the taco and refried beans. All of the dishes satisfied my craving for authentic mexican food.  Carolina's has rocketed to the top of my Arizona \"must do\" list. I will visit often!",

    "text": "It's obvious that everyone that walks in the door here loves it. This is one of three Carolina's in the Phoenix metro.  I've wanting to try the original Carolina's near downtown but did not want to drive all the way down to \"da ghetto\" all \"gangsta like\" to eat some fast Mexican food.  I have been to both North and West locations and found them to be very good and consistent.    After standing in line to order like at a \"taco stand\" I sat down and noticed all the dishes coming out of the kitchen, and I started to almost drool.  Then my number was called and the funny urge to yell BINGO, but rather went up to the counter to get my piping hot Machaca Burrito with Papas and a side of chips and spicy salsa (served in styro-foam, ARGUE!!). While the salsa heat was almost too much for my taste buds, it was simply delicious and even took some home.   Holy cow, this was amazing for the price.  As so many others have mentioned their tortillas are simply delish!! The beans were a good consistency, not too runny, not to dry and the rice had a great flavor.  Again the food is a great value for the price.  In summary, despite that fact this place is NOT eco-friendly by using stryo-foam it is more over a place that is convenient off the 101 and Peoria if you're in the area looking for good, fast Mexican food. This is not necessarily a destination place to plan for but rather a place of convenience with tasty food.",

There was no comparison.    I ordered a couple machaca soft tacos and a chimichanga.  They were busy, but not overwhelmed.  It took 25 minutes to get my food.  People were getting a bit testy and a couple made a scene about the slow service.   I think the tortillas would have been good, but the tacos were so wet, I couldn't pick them up without them falling apart.  The machaca was bland until I doused them with salsa... that I had to ask for.     The chimichanga was good... loaded with the machaca beef.  It was still a bit bland though, but salsa helped.  I don't know if I'll go back.",

And this was always to go go so we could ready other things with it at home. This was also partly because it was considered a shady part of town. It wasn't until I was a teenager that we actually stayed to try other things.  I don't live in Phoenix anymore, but I visit regularly to see my family. Since they live in the west part of the valley, we go to this location now instead. It's in a much better part of town. Every time I come, I have to stop at Carolina's, and I have to get 2-3 burritos. It's either chorizo, red chili, or a bean burrito. Then I have to get tortillas & butter too. This is a solid breakfast burrito spot.",

The food was okay at best, I got more lettuce than chicken, and the salsa was not hot at all.  It didn't have no kick or anything to it.  The cashier Samantha was very friendly and polite.   The place uses styrofoam boxes and stuff even when dining in, which I found not very unfriendly for the environment, and I personally think the price is a little high.  Overall a good experience, nothing really good or bad about this place.  I might come back someday, maybe.",

There was garnish on top and no rice & beans! I told them and they looked at me like I was nuts. There was rice & beans initially, but the guy took it back! After all the back & forth, I finally got the rest of the order. It looked like some other customers had problems with their orders too. Not a good night for Carolina's.

They are really quick with getting food out and you can sit down to eat or take it to go in no time at all.  There is a ton of parking in the shopping center.

The Taco was flavorless in spite of being very greasy, the enchalada was saved from tasteless by a very mild sauce, which also covered the Tamale. Same problem, very little flavor. The rice was gummy and you guessed it  Tasteless. The \"hot sauce\" was so watered down it tasted bland also. Have then been sued by some 80 year old from Ohio? The Only redeeming item was the refried beans, they actually tasted like Pinto beans with just enough flavoring to be good. Oh, the counter crew didn't give me the Taco I ordered, until I pointed out that it was missing from my Styrofoam box. Not a good day at Carolina's, probably one of many. I just can't recomend this place. Maybe if they just make tortillas they would be Ok.",

It's like trying to determine the best painting by Andy Warhol - subjective all the way and chances are you will find plenty of people who think his work is crap.  Authentic?  who the hell knows?

So, Carolina's serves a purpose for me.  An infrequent indulgence of my favorite burrito and consistently prepared.  Peace",

Red chile, green chile and beans wrapped in one of their killer tortillas.. smooth, tender, creamy and delicious. Make it a foot long ($.90)and now were talking! Pair it up with their salsa and you're in for some great Mexican goodness!  I mentioned the tortillas but I REALLY need to mention them again, they are fucking kick ass! Stretchy while tender with a slightly smokey char taste, this is about as perfect as a tortilla can get. Because they were so messed up with our order the manager gave us a free dozen.. they were just made too, hot and steamy in the plastic bag. I couldn't wait and ate one immediately.. my gawd, great Mexican experience.   I love you Carolina, will you marry me?",

I have eaten at most of the Mexican places in the valley during my life and while there are equals and many wanna be's, Carolina's is one of the greats!! I started at their original location many years ago, went to the east side location when I moved that way, and now I try to get to the west side location 2-3 times a month. As has been said before, the tortillas are fantastic!! The tacos are large, fresh and full of flavor. I get the beef or machaca (you have to ask) tacos and a red chili burrito when I visit. The red chili has the tart, earthy, smokey flavor that authentic chili sauce should have. The re-fried beans are fresh and made with lard the way they should be. Don't let the word lard scare you!! Real re-fried beans are made with it and that is what gives them the creaminess and flavor that all fried beans should have!  The staff has always been friendly, and while I cannot speak for others, there are tons of people working behind the counters and I have never had anything but quick, friendly service. The ordering line ALWAYS stretches to the door (or out the door) and the 'to go' area is ALWAYS packed. That says something about the place's quality.",

If you are a environmental evangelist, greenie, or sustainable.....you will panic when you see how the food is served..  Why?  All the food is served in styrofoam.  This becomes quite complicated when one tries to eat as the space is very limited and the containers consumer space.  I am picky about cleanliness and found that many of the other reviews were exaggerated.  Keep in mind, this place is a inexpensive fast food spot, it is not the Hotel Del Coronado.    Refried beans, in my mind, define a Mexican spot.  5 stars for their refried beans.    Tamales were great and fresh.  Tortillas are the size of a round man hole cover.  I had the mini chimis which were awesome and worth the $6.00.  I got robbed on my portion of the beans.  Still good.  :)  Ordered several items for the wife to try - all were a hit.  One does get nickel and dimed on tortilla chips.  As I have written before, anyone who spends $25 on fast Mexican food is entitled to as many chips and salsas as they want and they should not come at an additional cost.  If you try it, you will like it.  Just be mentally prepared for lines, styrofoam containers, and some dude complaining about the wait.  Chill that guy.",

If you take the time to thoroughly check your order, you will be satisfied, but you cannot be afraid to speak up. Sometimes they undercook the tacos which makes them seem stale.  The salsa is improved.  The chips are good. The beans and rice are yummy.   When it is super busy, you will not like most anything about it, but it is super busy because it is good food, so what do you want?  Also, they keep the AC on about 85 so be ready to sweat.   Now, the cleanliness issue.  There is an issue with cleanliness in the front of the house.  The back of the house seems to be kept much cleaner. For this reason, I get my food to go. I do NOT order beverages. The machines seem very unkempt and not maintained. I get the heeby jeebies just thinking about the bacteria in the ice maker and drink machines.    So that's my two cents.",

On this day the place was packed, the place was super dirty (I can understand since they where busy but still have someone quickly wipe stuff down), and the cashier I had was not polite nor was she paying attention. She was more concerned with the cashier next to her and talking to him. Please be careful when paying with a card here. I am sure since I don't usually check my card transactions here that I may have been wrongly charged before too. This place in my opinion has gone down over time and the food is still good but everything else seems to be lacking.",

I told him that we had to try out Arizona's version of Mexican food so he asked a local to recommend a great Mexican restaurant and they told us about this joint.  I got the two tamale plate with red sauce and my husband got the carne asada burrito along with chips and salsa. I didn't enjoy the tamales because it had a weird taste to it and the burrito was dry. The beans were actually the best part of the meal. The salsa could have been a little better, but the chips did seem fresh and crispy. Yeah, the places is a little run down and not \"clean\" as others say, but that type of stuff doesn't really bother me.",

It's dirty, a little disorganized (I understand that a restaurant will end up disorganized due to the chaos, but that does not excuse it from being dirty.)  The carne asada burritos were o.k. They don't have guacamole.  Their three way burrito is disgusting. It's meant to have green and red chili with beans, but I bit into the red chili side and didn't get to see if it had any green chili, because I stopped eating it.  Price is decent. Paid 16 dollars for 3 burritos, but for the type of food I got, I wouldn't pay 5 dollars for it. The quality is not great.   I wouldn't recommend it.",

My tortillas and hot sauce were ready in less than ten minutes she said they're waiting for the buttered tortilla. I heard the girl ask about the tortilla and once again they asked cooks in kitchen. People ordering huge meals AFTER me we're getting their orders left and right while I stand there and wait for one single buttered tortilla. I finally got fed up and told the young man and other lady that it was ridiculous that I'm still waiting for the one single tortilla. It's ashamed I had to get pissy with them before they finally made a consorted effort to get it.  Really??  Poor organization and customer service.  Food is good, but I recommend you don't ever order one single buttered tortilla because you'll be waiting forever.",

Carolina's West personnel throw bland food in a styrofoam carton and expect you to be content with some various combinations of lettuce, beans, cheese, and tortillas.  The taste is totally bland.  Abuelos, which is just a couple miles to the north, is a much better option for Mexican food.  Don't say that I didn't warn you!!!",

This place had been recommended to me by pretty much everyone when I told them I was looking for NM style Mexican food. We finally made it here & I was stoked! The girl behind the counter kept answering the phone while we were ordering, another worker was walking past us cursing at another employee...awwwwwkward. Now I'm willing to look past all of that IF the food is good, sadly disappointed doesn't even begin to cover it.    I ordered a carne asada chimichanga & my husband ordered the chorizo & potato combo plate.  The food came out quickly & my husband couldn't figure out what he was looking at on his plate.  It was just ground beef on top of mashed potatoes. Every place he's ever been has served it with fried potatoes & actual chorizo. Is this normal for AZ?  He didn't even want to eat it the food was so bland. I cut into my chimi & couldn't believe the meat that was coming out of it...boiled dry hamburger meat.  This was absolutely not carne asada. I gave it a shot thinking that at least if it's flavorful it won't matter. Nope. Bland, dry absolutely NO flavor. The guacamole on top was great & the tortilla wasn't heavy from being fried, it was nice & light.  But what's a chimi without yummy fillings?! I couldn't even finish it, we both had weird artificial aftertastes in our mouths as we were leaving. Blech. Sorry, but this is a huge \"never again\" for me.",
