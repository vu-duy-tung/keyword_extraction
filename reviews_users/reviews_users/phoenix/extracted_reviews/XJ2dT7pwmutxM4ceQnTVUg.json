    "text": "A trip to Cabela's is not for the faint-hearted. After traipsing through the indoor wilderness, my family and I were hungry, and planned to go to Tanger Outlets after grabbing some lunch. Since Westgate was right across the street, we figured we could easily get some food. To top it off, we were craving pizza. Low and behold, Mama Gina's was ready to answer the call when we arrived. We went on a Wednesday morning, shortly after they opened, and easily got seating. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but considerate too, letting us take off our jackets and get settled in before asking for drink and food orders. Their iced tea was tasty, fresh and cool.   We got some garlic knots for an appetizer, and were all shocked at how large they were. Topped with garlic, melted Parmesan, and butter, my mouth watered at the mere sight of them (and is watering now at the memory, goodness). They were just as delectable when we dug in. The marinara sauce was an amazing plus, delicious and flavorful. To be honest, I'm not usually a fan of marinara by itself, but with this appetizer, I couldn't get enough; we'd eaten almost all of it by the time our pizza arrived. We ordered a 16\", half bacon, half ham. I'm used to fakin' bacon on pizza, but no worries here! This bacon was the real McCoy, smoked and delicious on top of all the melted cheese. According to my folks, the ham was pretty good, too. We ended up leaving one slice of ham pizza uneaten, because we were stuffed. It wasn't too bad on the wallet, either. We left happy and full, and will definitely come back in the near future to satisfy our appetite for pizza.  After coming here to give my review, I am baffled this place doesn't have a higher rating. As far as I'm concerned, this place is great. The food is delectable, the service was spot on, and I'm very happy that such a quality pizzeria is relatively closeby. Five stars for you, Mama Gina's. Never change.",

He makes certain that our   beverages are always full and that our food is fresh and checks up on us regularly to see if we need anything else such as extra napkins and condiments such as garlic powder etc. So a special shout out to Joey for being an exceptional server at an exceptional restaurant. We highly recommend you eat there and ask for Joey as your server! In his absence the other servers do a great job as well, along with the management team is always available as Dylan the manager is always walking around the dining area making certain all goes well for all his customers.",

The service was prompt and friendly and the place was clean and well staffed.  The wings were obviously frozen wings with Franks Red Hot poured on them.  Considering Native New Yorker is across the street, it didnt seem like they put any effort into them.  The pizza was one of the worst I have had.  The crust was burned in some places and the dough was raw in the middle.  The pizza had a very weird soapy taste, almost as if the pizza was made on a pan that still had dishwater on it.$32 for 6 sub par wings and 1 nasty pizza was not ok.  So dissapointed as I was hoping ti have a good place I could walk to.  I wouldnt come back.",

Had to send it back and wait another 20 minutes for it to come back burnt. My other son's $9 kids chicken strip meal was ok, but they actually tried to charge us an additional $4 for a kids milk! Then our little girl of a waitress charged us for drinks we didn't order...had to complain about that too. Her attitude was really bad. Made the whole expierience even worse. It is very clear that she is totally inexperienced & should be working anywhere that doesn't involve paying customers. The manager, if there was one, in this \"family owned and operated\" business, was no where to be found. Needless to say, I was really close to walking out without paying, instead we just didn't tip. That was a 1st for me, ever!",

It was my first time eating at this place, the waiters were friendly and respectful, a friendly environment to relax and chat with family and friends.   Overall, the Hot and Spicy BBQ wings were ok, could've had more sauce on the wings to give it more flavor, but it was good overall. The Veggie pizza, in the other hand nothing to complain about perfect and delicious.",

Just because it's expensive doesn't mean that it taste better. At least I can say this place is a lot cleaner, nicer, bigger than La Piazza Al Forno. Plus the staff at mama Gina's was friendlier I just don't like that they lied about only selling large pizzas. They are all about selling to you at the pricy rate.",

It was forth of July weekend and my son had to use the potty really bad (he is 3) and i went to go take my son into Mama Gina's and this blonde manager stopped me and said \"you have to buy something before your son can use the restroom,\" I looked at the huge line out of the door and said to her, \"I have to stand in line and wait to buy something for my 3 year old son to go to the bathroom?,\" the manager was like \"yes!\" In the rudest coldest voice.     I couldn't believe what I was hearing, my son was going to have an accident and she wouldn't let my little boy use the restroom because I hadn't paid for anything? That is just the rudest thing I've ever seen, and such mean customer service.  I responded to her and said \"wow! You are so sweet!\" And then I left confused and in disbelief... FYI if your son or daughter are playing at the splash pad and the bathrooms are full, Fresh Healthy Cafe has considerate and understanding management that will let your children use the restroom.",

They charged me for a 2 topping when I ordered a 1 topping, it took the guy 30 minutes to bring the tiny pizza. I said black olive only and they gave me black olive and pepperoni, when I told them I don't eat meat they took it back and picked off the pepperoni and added extra cheese to hide it but the cheese was not melted and it still had the grease from the pepperoni.. Oh and not to mention it took the guy ANOTHER 30 minutes to do that to my pizza.. When I saw this I asked for my money back and walked out never to return, awful!",

    "text": "Worst management team ever. I was just there last week and I fell in love with the food the waiter was very polite and made sure my food was out right away because I had to go back to work. Went back today with my boyfriend because I loved it the first time and it was like a completely different place. The waiter was extremely rude and I waited so long for my food to come that I had to take it to go. As I sat down in my office at work I noticed that my order was incomplete. I was missing the knot and my plate was more water than it was sauce. How is that even possible? So I called back to have Luis answer, I told him my situation and he offered me a piece of bread for my next visit... Really? Even McDonald's offered you a whole meal no questions asked. So I decided to not touch my food and return once I left work. I went back after work and I gave Luis the food back and he didn't even look at it he tossed off to the side and left. He walked in and out of the kitchen walked around the restaurant even started attending other customers as I waited on him to at least remake my food. The older lady who was the waiter kept giving me dirty looks. If looks could kill I would probably be dead. When he finally ran out of excuses to avoid me he gave me a 10% discount card. I'm beyond pissed off. That not only did I pay for it, I also returned it and he couldn't even  give me a new plate or my money back. I was pretty much robbed tonight. I asked if I could speak to his manager and very rudely told me to call tomorrow. As I drove home I remembered he didn't give me a receipt or a letter to prove that I had returned my food. So I called him back and he said to me \"why are you asking for so much when I had supposedly eaten over half the food.\" He even decided to cross the line and literally called me a liar. I asked Luis why he was calling me that when I had returned my food and he said \"well you called me a liar first!\" This is the people you have running your restaurant? I'm more than disappointed, I paid for food that I never ate and was poorly treated.",

The sauce was okay but nothing to brag about. Honestly would have rather had Olive Garden lol . They are way overpriced here & there was some hoodrat that they let just sit on the patio and curse the n word  and all sorts of profanity loud on his phone. It was upsetting , other diners out there didn't seem pleased with it either and staff apparently saw nothing wrong with him cursing on the top of his lungs . Take in mind we had a 4 year old child with us as well. You also get the occasional kid walking by the patio cursing or saying obscene things to women. I didn't know west gate was the hood but apparently it's close enough for them to congregate here. If I wanted to pay that much for a crappy meal in the ghetto I would have.... Wait I think I just did. Very upset ... Waste of money .... Waste of time.",

We ordered the appetizer sample and cheese garlic bread to start. The Garlic Bread was good and cheese melted nicely without being burnt. The various items in the sampler were all good tasting. my wife and I ordered a supreme pizza for her and I and it was tasty. the crust was a little under cooked and flimsy/soggy. The supreme also came with black olives (which I don't like but just picked them off), which were not listed on the menu. We let the waiter know and he mentioned the menus were being updated already due to other issues and he'd let the manger know about that error. They took 10% off of our bill, without prompting, for the mistake.  Overall was pleased with the place and service. Will probably go back there sometime.",

They don't have a ber list or prices available to view as she said they were more of a bar?  Really? Don't go don't go don't go!!!!!",

The side salad was terrible (large chunks of stale lettuce, very large uncomfortable chunks of tomato, and a few olives).  The pizza was mediocre (slice of NY style pizza with melted cheese, tough crust, and burned veggies).  The service was pleasant, but slow.  Maybe I caught them on an off afternoon, because I am surprised that a place like this can survive with all of the high quality restaurants in this immediate area.",

    "text": "Went to Mama Gina's with a friend on a Wednesday I believe. Never been to this restaurant before, so decided to give it a try because I love Italian food! We sat outside, it was perfect weather and very nice interior decor as well as outside seating. The issue I had was when we placed the order all the food came at once, meaning we ordered the appetizer and entree and it all came at once!!! I was eating my salad and then my appetizer and meal came at the same time. I would have never ordered the appetizer if I knew my meal would come at the same time. Here is the worst part, as an Italian restaurant they didn't have alfredo sauce. What Italian restaurant doesn't have alfredo?? It's not hard to make either... The meat balls that I got weren't the best, it disintegrated in my mouth. No flavor at all, tasted like cardboard. The salad I got was a decent sized salad on a tiny little plate, so everything kept falling off and got messy quickly. I ordered a beer and it came in a plastic cup.... P.L.A.S.T.I.C...... :O C'mon! I get that I was sitting outside, but that seems like a cheap move. Overall the people were friendly here, but I won't be back because of the sauce.",

This was upsetting to me because I would have paid the extra for the ricotta had I just been told correctly.  I did order the garlic knots as well and they were okay, a little bland but not the worst I have had. All in all I will not return to this establishment not when  there is so many choices in the area.",

Our family of four wanted some pizza, and there's not a lot to choose from on the West side of town.  My husband suggested Mama Gina's and since I'd been wanting to try it for a while, we decided to go.  I'm glad that we did.  We ordered two appetizers, mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini.  Both arrived quickly and were hot and delicious.  We also ordered a 16 inch half cheese, half pepperoni for my husband and daughter to share and a small Supreme for my mom and I to share.  The waitress was very attentive and refilled drinks quickly.  She also took the dirty plates from our appetizers away while we were waiting for our pizza.  Many servers fail to do that.  When our pizzas came out, I noticed that our Supreme had mushrooms on it, which we had asked them to leave off.  They quickly offered to remake the pizza, but we declined as we did not want to wait for it.  We just picked the mushrooms off and it was fine.  The waitress apologized profusely and told us she would take a portion of it off of our check.  We all enjoyed the pizza and the atmosphere.  The service was really great, too.  We will definitely go back, and I hope all of the negative reviews don't stop people from giving it a try.",

    "text": "I'll start with the positives.  .... oh wait, there weren't any.  I can't even do a good analysis of the food because the wrong pizza was brought out and to boot it was a pizza we didn't particularly care for.  (Had an ingredient on it that my dining partner had a slight allergy to.) In short, completely horrible service, rude attitudes when trying to get our order straightened out, and owner/manager was unwilling to give a decent conciliation for our trouble.   Will never return.  Being treated like we were is unacceptable, especially when we acted civil and to the point.    Here is a list of follies that occured during our \"experience\" at Mama Gina's.   1.  Ordered an appetizer.  Was convinced by our waitress to try the garlic knots instead, only to find out when our food arrived 35 minutes later that they didn't even have any to bring out.  Sidenote:  After about 20 minutes we inquired on the whereabouts of this item to our waitress (20 minutes for some garlic bread is a little much) and she said she would go check...apparently that didn't happen. 2.  Wrong Pizza delivered to the table.  After inquiring about the order since it was taking quite awhile to arrive and we had a movie to catch.  The wrong pizza was brought out.  We had ordered a 16 inch BBQ Chicken pizza and a 20 inch Supreme was delivered to our table.  Honestly, it wasn't till 15 seconds after it was dropped off that we went... uh.. wait a minute... this isn't what we ordered.  Immediately went to find our waitress to let her know.  She went to her manager and they said they could make us the right one but we'd have to wait.  Pending our time issue with the movie, this wasn't an option.  Since we couldn't wait for another pizza to come out the manager said we could either take a 20% discount on the pizza or just leave and not pay.  At this point, we were starving and the movie was starting in 10 minutes.  Didn't really have a choice at this point.  I agreed to the 20% discount so we could at least have something to eat before we sat for another 2 hours without food.  (Side note:  couldn't eat much considering one of the items on the supreme includes an item that my date has a slight allergy to.) 3.  Wrong discount.  Once the bill came, we were charged for the pizza that came to our table.  Which was $9 more than what we originally ordered.  Making even the 20% discount they were offering a total more than what we were expecting to pay in the first place.  Waitress ended up paying for our beverages to help offset the cost.  Also, when speaking to the manager, he said we should have let him know sooner that there was an issue.  How were we to know???  The only thing we knew prior to the food coming out was that it was taking FOREVER to get to the table.  ... and that we did bring to their attention.    I truly dislike writing reviews that are this scathing but I just couldn't believe how we were treated by the management.  If you are in the service industry, and the mistakes are with your establishment, then do not make the customers feel as if they are the ones at fault.  I just don't believe they tried to make this better for us.",

    "text": "This was our second meetup at Mama Gina's. Around 10 people showing up. No problem with reservations (only 3 hours prior), and the exact seating (outside patio) was ready for us.  Just 5 hours earlier, they sent out a special over twitter: \"Today only: If you purchase 1 sandwich & a drink you can get a second sandwich free\" ( <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fmamaginasaz%2Fstatus%2F112260246013087744&s=1e6da1e1a777f27b49d72abe0020570e9012c601ba0fcbd8462cd651faac0f1f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter.com/mamaginasaz/...</a> )  All of us were planning our orders accordingly, so as to make use of the special. Instead of ordering 1 item, I was going to order more, so I could bring some home to my family. DENIED. We were told by the server, and then by management (through the server) that special was only 11a-1pm, and not available. The odd part was the original post was time-stamped around 1:30pm, after, they said, the special ended.   So what did they do to fix the situation? Absolutely nothing. In fact, one member of our party was charged extra for another side of marinera sauce for his garlic knots.  Don't get me wrong, the food and overall service was pretty good, and the food was the main reason this review was not a \"1\". However, had the special not been \"advertised\" over social media, we might have chosen a different venue. It almost seemed like a \"bait & switch\". The worst part was the complete failure to do anything to \"remedy\" the situation. Had this experience been fixed, or better yet, never occurred, this rating would have been at least a 3, and probably a 4. But for now, I can not overlook the absolute failure of communication between marketing company, restaurant management, and staff.   Here's to hoping they get everything figured out...",

I find it hilarious people are whining about having to wait during something like a cardinals game. Haha! What did you expect? Everyone was going to go eat somewhere else? Get over yourselves. I have ordered a few different things from their menus, love the wings, bar, and pizza. Also tried the Calzone and that is AMAZING. Yet to try the pasta but I suspect it is just as good. Always my \"Go-to\" place :) My only gripe is the tables wobble. Like, a lot haha. I know its nothing too crazy, but as a personal nudge you should get something a little more sturdy.

I am continually overlooking their faults because I LOVE their eggplant sandwich but I now realize it is a place I will not be going to anymore.  Usually my issues are with the service, which is not a surprise since I never consistently see the same faces there.    I have had a problem with the server overtipping themselves on my credit card.  I luckily noticed on a statement.   I did have this issue resolved but it took many calls for this to happen.  If you stay and eat there, the place is often very messy.  I have seen servers walk past a broom that had fallen in the middle of the floor instead of picking it up and putting it away.  I have seen servers pull tables apart, while people were sitting at them on game nights, even though the whole place was empty and the tables were not needed at that point.   My last (and it will be final) experience made me the most disappoint. I had made a to- go order.  I was surprised at how expensive it was this particular time.    I soon learned they are different menus for \"game nights\" (hockey games, etc) and apparently you are charged more even on to-go orders, which I find ridiculous.   My sandwich that I usually get costs almost $2 more and on this particular time the bread was burnt.  It is not that great of a place to go to, to spend that much money and I was frustrated that they price gauge, even on to go order to make a couple extra dollars on game nights.   There are definitely better places to go at Westgate.",

    "text": "Mama Gina might know best, but isn't giving her BEST these days.  It was Valentine's Day afternoon and we opted to divert our stomachs to Mama Gina's Pizzeria to avoid the 30-45 minute wait at another popular restaurant in the same center.  This restaurant has so much potential to bring in lots of business with its high visibility and prime corner location at Westgate Entertainment District.    Mama Gina's advertises itself as 'specializing in hospitality and pizza'.  I agree with their latter claim, as their pizza was actually the one thing that saved this place from my giving them a lower rating.  Upon checking in on Yelp, I noticed the \"$1 for 20oz Fountain Drink\" offer and asked our server if I could redeem it.  She appeared bothered and said she'd HAVE to ask.  Seriously?!!  $1 won't even put a dent in our bill for a table of 7.  We had the New York style Mama's Supreme with sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese, which was quite good.  Loved the crust.   The Side House Salad, on the other hand, tasted like cafeteria salad with Blue Cheese dressing, mixed with watered down mayo(?).  I prefer pungent chunks of real blue cheese in my blue cheese dressing.  We shared a few dishes amongst our group of 7.   - Meat stuffed Ravioli with extra meatballs:  The pasta texture was a little on the doughy side, the meatballs not beefy enough in taste, and marinara sauce was mediocre at best. - Baked Ziti: Similar taste to their Ravioli, except the pasta itself was better prepared. - Mama's Antipasto Salad:  Mixed greens topped with sun-dried tomatoes, roasted peppers, artichoke hearts, red onion, olives with balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  It was good, but not as fresh as I'd expected.  Drinks were served in flimsy 20 oz plastic cups, left empty too long at times.  Our server seemed perturbed again, when we asked for refills.  She must have forgotten about us.  So, we asked another server for refills, who must have whispered to our server that our cups had been empty for some time now. Our server's demeanor changed for the better, but seemed forced.  She returned to our table with the scripted 'How is everything?' and 'Can I get anyone anything else?'   At the end of our meal, I was handed our bill.  I stared down at our $100+ receipt for a little bit and read below the total:  ***Review us on \"Yelp\" and get 50% off your next visit!!! (excluding alcohol)***    Three questions for the the owners or the Management.  1) Why would you risk including such a great offer on your receipt and not ensure that your staff puts out their BEST?  2) Will I still get 50% off our next visit, even if I give you a 2-star review?  3) Lastly, when is it appropriate to automatically add 18% gratuity?  We had a group of 7 people and the place was not busy, probably 3/4 empty.  I usually tip 20% everywhere, but your service was not even deserving of 18%.  We're only in town once a year, but even so, it's doubtful that we'll return to this restaurant to redeem our 50% off.  Advice:  Try to be your BEST at all times.",

Everyone here was really nice.  We ordered the sampler appetizer which had a variety of food. Everything tasted good, but I think it's time to change or filter the oil everything was the same color and a little on the overdone side.   Our order of traditional wings had good flavor, but also were overcooked and crispy. The pepperoni pizza.... Average at best. They didn't tell us they ran out of garlic knots until we asked why we were given garlic bread.   This is our 2nd night in Glendale and will probably be back next year...we might give this place another go.",

We ordered a lot of food so the time in getting it was understandable. The prices we mild but I didn't feel like we got what we paid for.

In Westgate, we try to go during off times, since it gets so crowded during the weekends.  This was the perfect time to show up, around 4ish.  We found a spot out front and it wasn't busy inside.  As we were finishing, more people were starting to file in...good sign.  I'd read about the garlic knots, so we decided to start with them.  Firstly...they're HUGE!  Hubby and I looked at each other and couldn't believe how big they were.  They serve 6 of them, along with a side of marinara.  Secondly...they're really good!  They were hot and garlicky, and the marinara sauce was really tasty and light with them.  For our main courses, I went with the lasagna.  Because, when asking about different entrees, when I mentioned it, Justine's (our very friendly waitress) face lit up.  I could tell she really like it, as well.  Hubby went with the chicken parmesan with a side of spaghetti.  Both the entrees came with a salad, as well as an additional garlic knot.  The salads were cool and crispy, very fresh and big.  That seemed to be a theme here...the portions are really big!  My lasagna was so tasty, hot and melty...just how I like it.  And, the chicken parm was also very good, since hubby allowed me to have a taste.    I ended up only eating half of mine, and taking home the rest, along with 2 garlic knots.  Hubby was able to eat his whole meal, although he seems incredibly full right now...LOL!  The staff seemed very friendly...always smiling.  And, Justine was a very sweet and attentive server.  We will definitely be back...and next time, we'll be expecting a really BIG meal!!",

We had a group of 4 adults and 3 children so not THAT confusing to handle and we didn't even ask for separate bills but still got overcharged. The waitress looked annoyed right from the start. Not sure why, they were almost empty. We got 2 pizzas, an order of wings and an order of chicken nuggets. Only one adult ordered a Sprite (the rest drank water) and 3 kids got apple juice. Guess what the bill was? $88!!!! Turned out their apple juice is $4.50 a piece and after I asked the waitress if it came with refills and she assured me that it did she still charged us for refills!  The service was bad, we had to wait forever and she stopped at our table maybe 4 times at the most, including the times she was taking drink and food orders.    It also turned out that they tuck in 18% automatic gratuity on the bill which is really hard to see so we ended up tipping her ON TOP of the 18% she didn't deserve to begin with.   As far as the food goes, the wings were ok, the pizza was blah. So definitely won't go back.",

I asked how long it would be to have them remake it and he said they are busy so probably 20 min or more. We told him for get it because we had plans we tried taking the sauce off with a knife but it was making a mess and felt dumb so we just did not eat there and left. He asked if we wanted to take it with us. No we did not want a ton of sauce we dud not like them. We left 2 almost whole pizzas and hungry will not be back no discount sorry nothing at all.",

It was amazing. Came with my choice of pasta, side salad, and a garlic knot. The dressing for my salad was their house dressing, balsamic. AMAZING.  The service was better than good. Staff was very courteous and knowledgeable.  03/13/2015 The second time, was ever better. I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner. And the Mama's Sampler. WOW. The sampler came with EVERYTHING. Food came out surprisingly quickly for how busy they were. We watched the game on the patio and there was live music. It was a great atmosphere. Our waitress Heather was very efficient and pleasant.  Only downside to the evening was there was only one size pizza offered the 16\".  It's a great place for a date or to take your family. ENJOY!!!",

Was very upset I couldn't get just one slice of pizza on a Sunday. They said they only have that offer for couple of hours Monday through Friday . They just have that all the time to bring more business , nobody want to buy a whole pizza without knowing how good or bad it tastes .",

    "text": "Mama Gina's is nicely situated near the middle of Westgate.  Their menu mostly consists of pizza, subs, and pasta.  The interior is pretty basic but the patio (when it's cool enough) is roomy and it gives a little hint of Italy.    Out of their entire menu, I can speak to the subs, pizzas, and appetizers.  Their subs are tasty and filling and the appetizers (especially the Bruschetta) are pretty good and have a homemade taste.  The pizzas, however, are not very good.  For instance, the 16'' is dry, ultra thin, and not very filling.  If you are a fan of Papa John's, I'm pretty sure that you'll agree.  There are plenty of discounts too.  I bought a certificate through my work where I pay $5 and get $15, but have to spend at least $22.  So, after the math, $12 for $22 worth of food (excluding the pizzas) isn't bad (except for the first time I tried to use the coupon and they wouldn't let me use it because it was a Football Sunday even though it stated nothing to that affect on the certificate).  You can also get 20% off with your AMC movie ticket.  They also have some decent specials, but I can recall them... so, I'll update this review a bit in the future.",

We waited a few minutes and the server (he never said his name) asks us what to drink and tried to scurry away and I had to call him back in order fries for an appetizer. He seemed rushed. He drops our drinks and takes our order and twenty minutes later we are still waiting on our fries. We were there before other tables and they received fries, as well as, other menu items before us. While our server passes us four times, I had to ask how long fries take to come from the kitchen. He quickly goes to the computer and says he will check on it. Then, no less than a minute later our pizza arrives and five minutes minutes later my appetizer for my niece. Our server passes us seven times throughout our meal and never asks us if we needed refills or if we needed anything else. He was at the bar chatting or checking on a bigger party. We sit there waiting for him to come back to let him know we are ready for a box, then he asks, \"how is everything and I took the fries off your tab. It's a gift from the kitchen.\" A gift from the kitchen more than half way through our meal, thanks!!!!  Being in customer service/wait staff/bar industry and retail my entire life, I have never treated my customers like this. If you're going to be in this line of work, then work on your customer service skills, if you can't handle the stress of the job then find another one!   Not happy with the service. This service sucked.",

Plus they want a tip before it is made. Thinking if I gave no tip it would come out bad I tipped. I could not believe it. Thin pizza. Taste was good. A little greasy. WAY OVER PRICED. We went to BJ's brewhouse a few nights before and got the kids menu pizza, drink and a side for 5.95. It was thick and delicious (according to my grandson).

This is quite possibly the WORST dining experience I have ever had in my life.  My sister and I stopped in here to get something to eat before a concert this evening.  I ordered a meatball sub and my sister ordered boneless wings and a side salad.  The meatballs on this sandwich were clearly frozen, then thrown into a microwave oven, then some sad tomato sauce was thrown on top.  It was awful, tasteless and cold.  I WOULDN'T FEED THIS SANDWICH TO MY DOG.  Save your money, go to Subway for a meatball sub.  The meatball sub at Subway is twice as big, 12 inches and it has flavor, (for half the price of the 6 inch here with literally no flavor).  My sister advised her wings were mostly breading and absolutely disgusting.  We were hoping to stop in here and get a few slices before the show.  We were advised that between certain hours, this establishment doesn't offer slices.  BIG MISTAKE.  You are in a perfect position here \"Mama\", to serve slices to people who are on their way to concerts, sporting events, and the movie theater that sits adjacent to your location.  YOU ARE LOSING MONEY.  Terrible dining experience overall.  And they charged me $12.00 for a frozen, disgusting meatball sub.  Still reeling over that, seriously.  DO NOT EAT HERE EVER.  Get an education \"Mama\".  Your bartenders clearly need one too.  You don't serve a Blue Moon beer without a fresh slice of orange.  Do you have fresh produce?  I know your meat isn't fresh.  I had to post this immediately to stop people from getting lured into what they think might be a good meal.  You will thank me for passing it up.  There are several other establishments in the area that are better than this.  I have to say at least our server was nice and she was as accommodating as she could be under the circumstances.  The food here is GROSS!  As if this wasn't bad enough, the service was incredibly slow, we had to ask a young man who was cleaning a table next to us where our food was after soooo long.  If I could give this place less than zero stars, I WOULD.  You should be ashamed \"Mama\".  Close your doors and call Bar Rescue.  Your food is terrible and your bartenders don't have a clue.",

They gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. I can't eat meat. I was with another person, who didn't mind the other topping on his pepperoni. I went back to let them know they made a mistake. I was charged for two more pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. I saw someone tell the cook, how the pizzas should be made. Once I got my two pizzas, they had pepperoni with olives and pepperoni with pineapples. AGAIN! I was on lunch, there was no point for asking to fix this problem again because I had to go back to work. Brought it up to them, ask them if I could just get my money back since I can't eat the pizzas they made me. I was told I could not get my money back only credit. I don't want credit because that was my lunch money to eat. I was told by the employees,\"mistakes happen.\" After I ask for my money back. Which I understand mistakes do happen, I work in customers service too. But when I see an employee tell the cook how the pizzas should be made, one with only olives and one with only pineapple, and both pizzas still end up having pepperoni on it. That's not just a mistake. Which I still have the receipt that's says cheese pizzas with olives and pineapple.",

Fine, except that the tweet came AFTER that time, and it said COME ON IN.  2nd: The AC uniti or something came one EVERY TIME one of the servers, busboy, manager, etc came out through the door...and it stays on if the door is not closed completely...they on many of the occasion left it just slightly open so the LOUD UNIT stayed on. WE had to close the door.  #3: I was charged EXTRA for the EXTRA SMALL DISH of marinara sauce. No mention that there was a cost.   #4: NO SPECIALS, in fact even though there were 2 kids and 6 adults, three of which were separate, there was an automatic gratuity. 17%+.  AND they leave a spot for another gratuity in case you don't catch it. Good thing someone in the group pointed that out.  #5. The garlic knots were ok.  #6. My server seemed to not care about much, sorry I didn't order a BIG meal, but there was seemed little reason to do so.  #7. We meet once a week on Fridays and are looking for 4 specific place to hang on a regular basis..usually there are 8-12 people that come out...I am not sure I am voting for this place...  #8.

We put our name on the list to sit inside and were the only name at the time. Was told it would be 15 minutes. They continued to seat tables of 2 and fill the patio. I gave up a prime spot outside next to a heater that would have been fine thinking we would be seated soon. 1 hour later we were not seated and all the patio was filled and inside there were atleast 8 new tables of 2 and 4. We were wanting a table of 5. The manager did nothing to get us seated after we spoke up and the hostess was a real b!$&@! I will never step foot in that place. Update: owner replied with a totally made up version of the story. She replied in a very condescending manner which further solidified my original assessment of their customer service. Still won't admit when they were wrong. I did say I hoped they went out of business, that was wrong. I should have said their management team needed a full lobotomy. Nice try trying to paint me into the bad guy.",

Yea yea, you can question my taste if you want to because of that fact but I think we all secretly love her! Plus I got tickets on Groupon for half price (I claimed that was the only reason I went)  I digress. We were trying to find a place to eat and everywhere had a huge wait time.  We ended up wandering and finding Mama Gina's, we walked in and were seated immediately (good timing a huge crowd came right after) The server was very helpful in making suggestions.  Not wanting anything too heavy my friend and I decided to split the appetizer platter based on the server's rec, we each also had side salads and blue moons (on tap with an orange slice just the way I like it)  The bruschetta was to die for.  Some of the best bruschetta I've had. Fresh beautifully ripe juicy cherry tomatoes.  Cheese sticks tasted fresh, not dumped from a frozen box into a vat of oil, and the zucchini was delicious.  I wasn't a fan of the fried mushrooms, I have definitely had better.   I think this is a great addition to Westgate.  Their pricing is reasonable and the food and drink is good.  Nothing special about the ambiance, it is a small cafe type setting. We'll see how long the prices stay where they are but for now I give it a thumbs up!",

I arrived at the restaurant about an hour before the Blackhawks game at the arena. I was able to get seated, eat, and cash out in about 1/3 of the duration all of the other restaurants were quoting as estimated wait times. This isn't to say Mama Gina's wasn't busy, because it was - the staff was just able to turn tables over quickly and efficiently.  The food was good, the service was excellent, and an individual working behind the bar (who I surmised to be either a manager or the owner) was extraordinary.

My disappointment was with the margherita pizza, usually one of our favorites.  I've never had a margherita pizza like this.  Instead of thin, succulent slices of red tomatoes, halves of cherry tomatoes were dropped on the pie!  And not too many of those, either.  Instead of chiffonaded basil, or chopped basil, sprinkled across the pie, one large leaf was placed in the middle of each slice.  I had to tear each leaf into pieces by hand in order to properly distribute them across each piece so I could get that wonderful basil flavor in each bite.  The sauce was bland, more sweet like Oreganos rather than a real Italian taste.  The crust was okay.  Upon a return to Westgate Entertainment Center we'll be looking for another place to spend our food dollars.",

He forgot to put in our order until 5:20, and slices came out at 5:35. The quality was on par with Sbarro. I could understand if the place was packed, but there were 6 employees along with the owner working, and only 4 tables sat the entire time we were there. The only reason this isn't 1 star is that the decor & bar area was pretty awesome.  I also wasn't a huge fan of both TVs being tuned to BlackHawk Down- not really something I want my toddlers watching.",

Their pizza is always nice and hot, the crust is crispy like it should be, there is a great balance between sauce, cheese, and the additional toppings. Their anti pesto salad is amazing and can easily feed a family of four as an appetizer. Their chicken fingers taste really good, crispy on the outside, and nice and tender on the inside. Their garlic knots are some of the best I have ever had. I am in love with the fact that they make their own salad dressing, as you can easily tell the difference from store bought and home made. I am in love with the service as well. They are really attentive no matter how busy it gets, they always check in with their guests. They definitely have treated my family and I every time we come in as family and I love it. This is a great little family restaurant with a little something for everyone.",

We had the appetizer sampler because we didn't want to get to full but we can't wait to return to try there massive sandwiches and fresh looking pasta!  Give it a try....",

    "text": "I don't get out to the far West side very often. In fact, it had been so long that I didn't even know all that Westgate stuff was even there. Imagine my surprise! I have been to a few games at the stadium, but all of the shopping and restaurants were new to me. It's absolutely beautiful here.   It was also nearly deserted when I went today - no games going on. There's not much else out here. Just this giant oasis of awesome in the middle of a corn field.   I've glazed over the other reviews here and I almost didn't get it at first. I mean, such polarized opinions about a pizza place. Walking around Westgate and seeing Mama Gina's, I get it now. Mama Gina's is a nice medium sized restaurant/bar. It's really clean and decorated well. The seating is comfortable and everything is new. Also - it smells like pizza - as a pizza place should.  There's a lovely patio with a giant glass door that I imagine can be opened when weather permits to have an indoor/outdoor atmosphere. There are big flatscreens playing whatever sports is on. They appear to have a full bar as well.   I ate a slice and took a pie home. Their pizza is pretty unique. It's very flavorful and good. I could tell that their dough was made fresh daily - it was soft and airy. They clearly use quality ingredients. It's a huge cut above a cheapie chain. While waiting, I saw some other food pass by on the way to their respective tables... everything looked pretty amazing and delicious.   A group was leaving before me and an older man said \"thanks\" to the manager. Then he added that he hadn't had pizza like that since he was a kid and that it was the best pizza he had eaten in years. It was a sincere compliment.  A slice and a soda set me back less than 5 bucks, and the slice was huge enough to fill me up. The pie I took home was as good as the slice I had. This is the kind of pizza you re-heat in the oven rather than the microwave.   Now the problems - well, there's really only one and all other perceived problems stem from it... it's the location. Because it's next to the stadium and little else, it's either going to be super busy or relatively empty. Because of this, service isn't going to be as consistent - you're just going to have to develop a little patience. Also - most customers coming to this sort of place when busy are the \"I'm drunk and happy my team won\" or \"I'm drunk and pissed my team lost\" types - neither of which are a treat to serve when most of the time you're used to things being fairly calm.   I recommend eating here when there's not a game (or even when there is - just be patient - same with all the restaurants in Westgate) - the food is worth a bit of a drive, and Westgate is a beautiful commerce center.",

    "text": "I like Westgate. Who knows if it'll last as a Glendale/Arizona destination for outdoor excitement for bored Phoenicians, but I hope it does. Unfortunately, the new Mama Gina's Pizzeria isn't helping.  Is there a better time to test a restaurant than when they're dead at 4:30PM on a Wednesday? They should be both: at their best and thankful they have paying customers to pay their salaries. And at this time, there were three times the number of cooks than customers...so, that means, it was JUST me and my mother in the (INCREDIBLY SMALL) dinning room and six of them. Surely, six employees behind the counter couldn't screw up a simple pizza, right?  What is that old phrase about too many cooks in the kitchen? They spoil the soup? Fine, switch that to pizza (AT A PIZZERIA, no less) and you'll have this generic place.  Don't be fooled by the \"New York Style,\" 'cuz it ain't thin. Don't be fooled by the high prices, 'cuz it ain't chic. They use stock cheese, pepperoni and ham and they burn the bottom crust. So, why did I pay $22 for a 16\" + just two drinks? Because the place looked good when I attended a movie at AMC Westgate?  Looks are deceiving. Trust me: this place is mediocre at best. The service is good, though the waitress sat in the dining room eating a salad while I waited patiently for her to refill my iced tea.  I'm not into gourmet pizza - GIVE ME the GREASE, GRANNY! - so I was a little hesitant entering this restaurant, which, by the way, stated they're CLOSED on one side of their establishment, yet OPEN at another entrance...that should've been an indication of their insecurities. Luckily, the absolutely mediocre food swayed me from eating epicure pizza.  Though it was not the worst I've eaten - I have ordered that $5 Little Caesar's (counterfeit) pizza deal, after all - it was sooo \"okay\" that I simply cannot recommend this place to anyone. Even \"New York\" pizza lovers. Don't go. You can do so much more with $22 and your time.",

    "text": "After having a disastrous time at Saddle Ranch(see my other review), we decided to try another restaurant in Westgate and went to Mama Gina's.    We walked in, asked if they could handle a party of 7, and they said they could.  We were seated almost immediately and our drink order was taken.    When you go to Mama Gina's website, they have a tab for specials.  On Sundays, there are a choice of 2; either a 16\" cheese pizza for $10, or a family feast of pasta, salad, and garlic knots for $20.  When I asked our server(name of Hung) about the specials, he said there were none.  Here's the website if anyone is interested in checking this out:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmamaginaspizzeria.com&s=dc1de20886a450fb133a0ccc462087561674e6d851742fcdd25228ee50b6d340\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mamaginaspizzeria.com</a>  We ordered a Margherita pizza, a kids chicken tenders, and 3 soft drinks(since there were 2 families, we each placed our own order; hence only 1 pizza and 3 drinks).  The food came from the kitchen disjointedly.  Our son's chicken tenders and fries, and our part of our friends order came out first.  The chicken tenders(2), were the typical Sysco style deep freeze chicken tenders and came with a mountain of fries that looked good.  When our pizza showed up, it was covered in sliced cherry tomatoes.  Nowhere on the menu, does it say that the pizza has sliced tomatoes on it. Here is what the menu states:   Margherita Tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, fresh garlic and olive oil  I have had Margherita pizza either with sliced tomatoes or with tomato sauce.  I prefer it with tomato sauce.  If you're going to put sliced tomatoes on it, please put that on your menu!  Never saw or tasted the garlic; and the basil was not what I'd call fresh.  The crust tasted as if it had been made ahead of time and frozen.  As for the pizza, it was ok.  IMHO, better than Totino's or some other frozen variety; but in no way was it worth almost $20.    So...after some deep freeze chicken tenders, a mediocre pizza, and 3 soft drinks; we got the bill.  $40.22 including the City of Glendale's 10%+ sales tax rate.  At $20.00, I might come back, but at $40.00?  No way!  Too many other good pizza choices for the same or less $$.  Grimaldi's is only about a mile or so away, and their pizza is light years ahead of Mama Gina's, and about the same price.  I'm sure the rent at Westgate is high, so the restaurants have to charge accordingly.  In that case, serve food that is equal to the prices you are charging.  As a side note, when I went to the website for Gina's Pizza; it shows what looks like a Margherita pizza on the home page.  The pizza in the picture looks hot and fresh, and yes, it shows a few sliced tomatoes.  The pizza we received looked nothing like the pizza on their website.",

Its great when you can see everyone gets along as if they were family and when they can laugh with the owner, which he came by and made sure everything was going well.

They told us they don't take reservations when there are events at the stadium but it would not be a problem as we were coming in at 5:30. I got there at 4:30 to secure a table, told the that there were 14 of us.  She said no problem, and when i asked if she needed my name, she said no. I sat at the bar for a while and noticed her taking names down for other parties.  Went to check, and my name was not on the list. So, I was told it would be 45-60 minutes. My party had arrived by that time, there was no place to wait and everyone was ahead of us.  Meanwhile, tables were not being bused and the managers were running around looking like they had no idea what to do.  Finally decided to go elsewhere.  No idea what the food was like...",

    "text": "Nice decor and love the indoor-outdoor patio area.   Friendly service but our waitress asked if we were ready for our check before we were done with our appetizer.  Not sure if she forgot we ordered more food, or if she was just trying to rush us out the door...or maybe both.  Their large salads is big enough for 2 to share but it only came with 1 garlic knot and I wish it came with more. The Greek dressing was alright but I've had better. Same with the Margarita pizza....it was good but I've had better. The crust was thin and crunchy and the toppings were mot distributed evenly around the pizza so every slice was different.  Great location though! Check in to get a $1 fountain drink!",

We ordered Mama's Bruschetta and then 6 mild boneless wings and 6 bbq boneless wings.   The bruschetta was good- the bread was soft and was served with plenty tomato topping. The wings were highly breaded, wish there had been bigger pieces of actual chicken, but had a good flavor.   Overall, it was a good experience, and I would return to try pizza in the future.   Just a note-they don't do slices, they only serve 16 inch pizzas, this was why we didn't get one, too much for two people which was kind of a bummer.",

    "text": "My wife and I had our first (and most likely last) visit to Mama Gina's Pizzeria on 7/14/19.  It started with our experience there, however the \"icing on the cake\" came when I tried to discuss the issue(s) with them afterward.  We went to see Hugh Jackman in concert and parked in a garage for the first time for $10.  We asked the parking attendant if the local restaurants would \"validate\" the the garage parking as they due to outside.  The attendant assured us that they would.  So we decided to try Mama Gina's.  We chose to sit outside due to wanting to make sure we were on time for our show and there was a bit of a wait to sit indoors.  Our server (Iris) was nice enough and we asked if they validated and even showed her our parking voucher.  She said sure and that she would take the ticket at the end of our meal.  We ordered the sampler, after all this was our first visit and we wanted a little bit of everything right?  As we watched plate after plate come out of the kitchen (several times being delivered to wrong tables) we wondered if/ when we would get our appetizer.  Finally it came but had basic garlic bread and no garlic knots.  When I asked Iris about this, she had to check to see if the sampler came with knots (their menu says it does but?)  She came back and said the kitchen ran out.  Interesting as we watched several orders of garlic knots be delivered and why this wasn't communicated to us sooner I do not know..  I asked if they might have just one so I could try them.  She returned with one and said the kitchen started making more... ????  Odd but OK, great.   We also witnessed \"runners\" be reprimanded by what I assume was a manger in front of customers.  Having worked in customer service for years and even in the food service industry, I know that was not the time nor the place to   Needing to make it to our show we had to leave after the appetizer (we parked at 5:31PM, went to the restaurant, was seated without a wait, but our check wasn't printed until 6:40PM.  Over an hour for an appetizer seems a bit long.   We gave the parking voucher to Iris to be validated and she disappeared which was not the first time vanished.  When she came back she said that they do not validate the parking for the garage we parked in and apologized.  While I wanted to talk to the manager then and there we had to leave in so we weren't late for our show.  We paid the bill and left.  After a few days of thinking about it, I decided I should contact the restaurant and inform them of our experience.  Utilizing the \"contact us\" option on their website (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnew1.mamaginaspizzeria.com%2Fcontact&s=2605cc7ebf95d58e2481910ac8b2d215feb44131e68822903cdc49780463e388\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">new1.mamaginaspizzeria.c...</a>) I sent them an email last week and provided my cell and email as contacts.  I believe it was 7/18/19.  To date I have not received a single response.    So I can only assume that they do not care about the quality of their customer experience and that my wife and I are making the right decision to never return there.  I hope this review helps someone not have the same experience as we did.",

However, pretty much all the restaurants we went to had massive lines or 90 minute wait times. Hardly surprising given the 50,000 or so fans at the game. However, we lucked out at Mama Gina's. We got a table almost immediately inside where the service was uniformly excellent. We ordered the house special pizza and a portion of wings to share. Both were massive but excellent, especially the pizza. Accompanied by a couple of beers for me (and coca-cola for the designated driver) we emerged into the sunshine to head back to base with a couple of pizza slices and leftover wings for the following day's lunch.

After realizing there was a 55 minute wait for our first choice, we settled here as the wait was much shorter.  When we were seated, they did not give us menus so we had to ask for them. Also had to ask for silverware and water.  When the server came to get our drink order we told her that we were ready to order as well. We asked for a couple of specific beers and she wasn't sure if she had them (she had to go check). We ordered the hummus appetizer and a cheesesteak sandwich. All of our food came out at the same time, which was really irritating to me. I told the runner that I hate paying for an appetizer when it comes out at the same time as my food. He said \"oh sorry\". Then I told our server that I was disappointed the appetizer and food came out at the same time and asked if she could talk to the manager. After she came back she said nothing could be done for me because the food comes out of the kitchen when it's ready. Then we asked to speak with the manager, who proceeded to argue with us. Really??? He also was sure to tell us they had been in business for 5 years. Not sure why he needed to tell us that. All I was asking for was the hummus to be comped because it came out late (with my meal). I wouldn't have ordered an appetizer if I knew it would come out at the same time as the meal. He finally took it off the bill.  Bottom line, the experience was horrible because of the lack of basic customer service. The food was ok, nothing special. Wine and beer were pricey and beer was served in plastic cups. We won't be back.",

Rude!!! This is the first time this ever happened to us for so many years we've been doing this in many restaurants! The weather's cold! They don't have any hot beverages so what do they expect from us to freeze? Our visitors were seniors. Old people they didn't respect and took away hot beverages from them! Disprespectful! I'll never go back here again! And definitely share this to all of my friends. The food the was bland!!!!We should have just left but since the pizza was already baked we just figured to stay to show respect. The management needs to take care of these issues. We came to eat not to have headaches. I was so upset and so is my family! Find other place to eat at westgate but not here!",

When I asked server to heat up entree it took so long my Husband had finished his meal which wasnt to hit either and I decided not to wait any longer paid check and left! Never will be back !

We ordered a pizza. After about 30 minutes had passed, I asked our server where the food was and he said that it would be right out. Another 20 minutes went by and he kept avoiding us. I asked another server for the manager. She was very nice and tried to deflect us from speaking with the owner by getting our server. After about another 10 minutes of investigating he discovered that in fact they gave our pizza to another table. He said they already started a new one and our bill would be discounted. We got our pizza, which wasn't even that good. When we got our bill, they took a measley 10% off of the bill. Any self respecting customer oriented business would have comped the pizza. Not only did we wait a ridiculous amount of time to eat a mediocre meal, but we were late for the game because of it. I will never go here again and I will never recommend it to friends or family or foe for that matter. Long story short, of I were Mama Gina, I would be highly disappointed that my name was associated with this establishment.",

They told me that it was, so we brought our very well-behaved, certified therapy dog for lunch with us. The servers were nice & brought water for our dog. One of them, as well as other patrons, even took her picture. We went there three more times with our dog & were welcomed. Here's where it goes bad: We went for lunch on a Saturday. That's apparently one of the days that the owner is there, & he absolutely refused to allow our dog on the patio. He told us that there is a state law forbidding non-service dogs from patio dining. We knew this wasn't the truth. He told us if we could prove that, he'd allow dogs there. I found the county laws regarding patio dining & dogs & faxed it to him. Basically all they needed to do was post a sign stating that their patio is dog friendly. He sent us an email, going back on his word & still refusing. We will not spend another dime at a restaurant whose owner has zero integrity.",

    "text": "What's up to all you Yelpers out there? I recently came across this place yesterday as me, my girlfriend, and her daughter came out of the AMC theater at Westgate. This place must have just opened up this week as it was still closed last week when I was at Westgate. Now I want you to keep in mind that this place just opened when u go in. There isn't really anything about the look of the place that makes it stand out from any other place. The people genuinely seemed excited for us when we came in the place so that's good. Our waiter I didn't catch his name but he didn't seem to comfortable, he seemed kind of nervous. I had the Stromboli which I thought was pretty good. My girl had the greek salad, it was ok. The chicken that came on it seemed a bit dry. Her daughter had chicken tenders with french fries. She kept yelling saying how delicious it was so if u got a 4yr old go with the chicken tenders. I had a word with the person who brought our food because a couple of the chicken tenders look like as if they were bitten. They manager came out and offered to replace the meal but we didn't because she wasn't going to eat all of her meal anyways so what's one less chicken tender. We also ordered some garlic knots but we never got them. But I probably would have had I remembered then myself instead of hours later once I got home. But I guess that sums up r meal there at Mama Gina's. It was ok, but nothing really that makes it a \"must eat\" place. But I would recommend it if u happen to be at Westgate despite how my review comes across. Its just not a place that I would go out of my way to eat at. But I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened this week and might need a bit of time to get situated and hit their stride. So I will probably wait and check it out again in a few months. The building its in has already been about 3 other places since Westgate open. So hopefully this place can stick around for awhile.",

The bruschetta we ordered was quite the surprise when it showed up doused in balsamic vinegar... not a big deal to some, but we dislike balsamic and when the menu actually lists all of the ingredients for the bruschetta and balsamic vinegar was not included one would think that balsamic would not be on it.  Our waiter was clearly overwhelmed (he let us know on several occasions that it was a bad day and he had a bad table on the other side of the restaurant) and we went almost the whole meal without a refill to our drinks.  Also, tonight we ordered garlic knots for carryout and the bottoms on all six were significantly burnt and the tops were more than browned.  They were dry with out the yummy buttery garlic salt knots typically come with.  Hopefully Mama Gina's will grow into its own as it matures in its time here at the Westgate.",

    "text": "This place is located within the Westgate shopping complex. My wife and I went a few weeks ago because we were given a gift certificate to go. It was our first time, and we probably won't be going back.  To start our waitress was clueless about almost everything. She seemed flustered by our drink order, and when she asked what kind of dressing I'd like for my salad I told her oil and vinegar (a staple for any Italian restaurant). That threw her for a loop, and I had to actually explain to her what I wanted. She went away and came back twice trying to figure it out before finally bringing it. Secondly my wife and I both ordered eggplant Parmesan. Now they have too eggplant Parmesan dishes, one with pasta, one a sandwich. She assumed we meant the sandwich and brought that out. When we informed her it was incorrect she began arguing with us about how that is the only eggplant Parmesan dish they had. I told her she was incorrect and she disappeared again, came back and said she put the new order in. When it came out the marinara sauce was ok, nothing special, but the eggplant was a little overly breaded. To top it off, usually, when a dish gets sent back (let alone 2), at most places a manager comes over and apologizes. That would have gone a long way. Instead I noticed who I could only assume was the manager, or possibly owner, usher a young couple in and try to bend over backwards to please them. All the while ignoring us. Now it's possible our clueless waitress didn't inform him about our predicament, in which case that is sad, and he needs to pay closer attention to what is going on around him. Oh, and the bread knots many people rave about, I wasn't impressed. They tasted like they had been left out at least a day, were stale, and warmed up. If other places are busy and this place isn't give it a shot, your experience may be different than ours, but we probably won't be returning.",

    "text": "And the Worst Customer Service Award in Phoenix goes to...  Mama Gina's.  I don't even know where to start. I'm pretty fair in how I rate businesses on Yelp (check out my other reviews), but let me just say that this place belongs on Kitchen Nightmares.   I had purchased a number of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificates to this place, and used a few of them awhile back. The pizza was...okay, but time had passed and we decided to give it another try and use up the remaining certificates I'd purchased. So we entered the restaurant, and first thing, let them know that we would be dining on one of these <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificates to which they had no problem. They took down the numbers and sat us at a table. The server asked us what we'd like to order so we went with their white pie, as we remembered that being the better of the pizzas we'd tried last time. He walked away, and returned minutes later to inform us that our certificates were no longer valid and asked what we'd like to do. We told him to give us a moment to think about it, and he left us there to go over our options. We had a Groupon purchase with Opa Life, right across the courtyard, so we decided to go that route instead. We packed up and were about to leave, assuming that he put a hold on the order, when he approaches us with the pizza we told him to hold off on. He realized he'd made a mistake and nervously returned the pizza to the kitcken.   As we were on our way out the door, a woman we can only guess was the on-duty manager yells at us from across the restaurant to stay put. She approaches us and let's us know that she is going to call security on us. We are in a moment of shock, and explained the situation to her, which she should have fully understood as she was the same person we'd given the certificates to in the first place. BUT she continued to cause a scene, and told us that she'll \"let us go\", and that she would normally call security on people who don't pay for their food. Ummm, we hadn't even touched the pizza, nor did we have any intention of ordering it after discovering the certificates I'd purchased online were no longer valid. As for the server, he denied ever coming over to our table and being told to give us a moment.   What a ridiculous scenario this was. I've eaten at many restaurants here in the valley, mostly pleasant experiences, and never in my wildest would have pictured a manager (?) confronting and threatening to call security for deciding not to dine there. It was clearly their mistake, and they turned their mistake into an embarrassing and completely uncalled for situation. I'll never step foot in this business again, and I will make sure anyone I know who may consider dining here thinks twice about it.  ----------------------------UPDATE------------------------------  In response to manager/owner Lisa's reply:  Lisa, you are absolutely right that it was a simple misunderstanding. The problem is that a simple misunderstanding turned into an accusatory and embarrassing situation. We should have been free to exit the restaurant without being pulled into a dramatic scene initiated by a staff member.  When the server approached us minutes after ordering to inform us that the certificates, that we had explained upon entering the restaurant that we'd be dining on, were invalid, and asked us what we'd like to do, we told him verbatim, \"Give us a few minutes to think it over. Thank you.\" That should have put a halt on the order and the awkwardness that followed. Businesses usually practice a \"customer is always right\" type of environment, and I don't always agree with it, but this incident was the polar opposite of that concept; initiated by the staff and escalated when they confronted and threatened us in front of other customers. I've eaten at many restaurants. I've seen good customer service, mediocre, and bad. This was the equivalent of things we'd seen on the Amy's Baking Company episode of Kitchen Nightmares.",

My waitress this time was fine, however, the manager, or whoever was in charge was turning away diners 45 minutes before the 9pm closing. I understand that restaurants have a closing time, however 45 minutes prior is ridiculous and I am sure they lose at least a couple hundred dollars each night that it happens. It is also terrible customer service to start turning away people who want to dine in starting at 8:15 pm. That is hardly late. If that were myself I would have not returned. Prior experiences have made me not return for 2 years. Service has been slow in the past and wait staff has not been very attentive to refill drinks or be quick for those going to movies. I really do like the food but the overall service every time I have been in has been terrible. I hope you don't close, but I feel like you will if you don't get it together.",

It's spacious and a delight for people who like to look at something other than a wall, as you can see all of Westgate from their patio.  Food and drinks... this is where they lost me. Pizza has absolutely NO flavor. Mozzarella sticks had no cheese on the inside. Wings were decent but nothing special. They don't serve margaritas because there's no blender... I thought that was interesting.   The bill came out to $75 for one pizza, wings and a sampler. It just wasn't worth it.",

Another in our group ordered a philly cheesesteak sandwich that looked yummy. Our service was good. We were actually enjoying our evening and food then came the bad: the check  My husband and I ordered the special which was $22 and change plus he had a soda to drink. Our bill was $35. Why you ask? Because the tip 18% was automatically added to the bill. I asked the manager why the tip was automatically added thinking it may be because we asked for the check to be split. She informed me that they automatically add the tip to groups of 6 or more. Our server then said \"Oh, I thought it was 5 or more\". Well her loss because I would have tipped more than their automatic tip but I hate being forced to tip especially without any advanced warning (like something printed on the menu). \\  Bottom line-there are other choices in this area and we will definitely be going to those before I come back here. If you visit with 6 or more people either go somewhere else or don't sit together!",

I recently dined at lunchtime.  I saw 'pizza by the slice' and asked which kinds were available to be told about the special, which was a slice, side salad and drink for a whopping $7.50.  Then my antipasto salad was delivered without dressing (miscommunication on the server's part) but I let it slide as it tasted good without it and I didn't want to bother them.  The thing that chaps my hide was when I asked for a side of ranch they charged me 60 cents.  You think they would have let that slide since THEY forgot the dressing for my salad.  Their kids meals are way overpriced.  Now, I am not cheap but places like this make me feel like I am because I get irritated when they charge too much or for things that should be included!  There's  a place down the street whose lunch 'special' is 3 bucks cheaper.  Guess I'll stick with that",

The waitress shows up to ask how it's going and we ask for the other two plates of food. She is completely surprised and told us the meals had to come to our table. We told her two times that they did not make it to our table. We asked that she please take the meals off of our bill. My wife asked who the main manager was and she approached the main manager sitting at a table, who seemed annoyed that she was letting him know her experience. He asked her what do you want me to do, sorry your food didn't show up? Sorry, My wife asked him why are you asking me what you want me to do? What are you going to do? He said he would take 10 percent off of the bill. She said don't bother, and she asked if he would come to our table to speak to everyone and he flat out said No! Wow great customer service!  Another person came by our table and stated we took 20% off the bill. We were not looking for a discount, we were just simply wanting to let them know that they failed at giving us a great experience at their restaurant, that was it.  Here's one: how about you get your lazy rear up off your seat and make our experience better than telling us sorry you didn't get to eat the dinner you ordered? Not one time did anyone offer to go make us our meals. They were more concerned telling us that they knew the food came out of the kitchen. My guess is they don't need customers like me that get upset when a group of four people go out to eat and only two dinners show up at the table. We won't be going back! What kind of manager is ok with four people ordering food and only two of the meals make it to the table?",

We visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. Last night proved it will be the last time. A 16' pizza is now $20 or more. All the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. They only have one size pizza. We ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. We asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. We have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time.  Ordered 6 wings $6.50 for 6 wings  They were very good. We asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. We got charged .60c for a souffle cup. Nope that was it. So very dissatisfied overall. Service was mediocre. Guess all customers will have to pay for the minimum wage hike, tipping no longer needed.",

    "text": "Cardinals opening day (8.25.2015) was BUSY!   My date and I grabbed a seat at the bar and were greeted by a man in the sell-line (an individual calling the shots and assists food coming out of the kitchen by passing the food into the servers hands to be taken out to their tables. All of that done correctly by the way). This man was energetic, funny, and really owning it. Well, that's because to our surprise, it was the owner!  Sami - a HUGE personal thanks to you and your great team at Gina's. The service that you expect and show when you are present really made our first experience one to remember.   Servers were busting their asses, so there was lots of movement. That, coupled along with the loud talk of tables in the room, and they exemplary teamwork seen really makes this review an easy 5-Stars. Did I mention not one-plate crashed while we were there? Always a plus in a intimate room with many people and quick service.  Service, easy 5-Stars.   Then the food came out: A big issue with other restaurants these days have is that many places are afraid to season. ****Not Gina's.***** For me, service can be impeccable, but if the food is 'safe' then what's the point of going to eat there? Anyone can make bland-gruel. Again, you won't find that at Gina's...  We got wings (mild), and the stromboli. Holy hell, it was seasoned! Our items were cooked perfectly (impressive as it was 1 hour before the game time and a lot of other places might have rushed the food, causing under-cooking) but not here. Wings were piping hot, and not greasy, The stromboli was perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey-in the middle with a helping of herbs, and garlic+ parmesan.   Lets talk about Marinara - no, not a 50-gallon barrel of Ragu that was trucked in from god knows where, but home made, herb-infused, you can see the garlic in the blend kind of - marinara. That is the kind you will find at Gina's. My marinara is top (Duh) - but a close second is Gina's, haha.  Chefs were very professional and their cooking skills were top-notch.  If you want to feel like you've been adopted by a family in Chicago and get fed some great Italian food, then I would recommend this to you.   Salute !",

It was lacking spices more basil or garlic would have really made it better, me and my friend had to add ample amounts of salt and pepper to it to get it to develop any flavor. and when I'm paying $17 for a single pizza i definitely expect a lot more from the quality.

MUCH! too generous.  Instead, go over to the Yardhouse or Margaritaville.  The wait will be longer but there is a reason for that.  Either that, or do not go to Westgate for a meal.  Go somewhere else and then head over to Westgate if you have a concert or want to see a movie there.  Really a shame.    DO NOT, I repeat - DO NOT - go to this place!!!

Last night we decided to try a couple of their entrees and were surprised by the bang for the buck, especially with the over inflated prices you'll find at some of the other eateries at Westgate.  My wife and I tried the Eggplant Parmigianna and Lasagna, both flavorful and lacking the generic take on Italian that many establishments have in the Phoenix-Metro area.  For a reasonable price your entree will be accompanied with a dinner salad and some great garlic knots.  Because of it's limited dining room size it is a great place to eat and run in a timely fashion before catching one of the many events Westgate hosts.  I'm sure Mama Gina's has encountered challenges from time to time just from reading the various reviews, having said that, enter with an open mind and give it a try, to date it has always been enjoyable for us.",

    "text": "As an employee of one of the nearby arenas, I chose Mama Gina's on a night where I was stuck at work late and needed to pick up a quick bite. I went in with a friend and we both ordered to go. Both of us got hot sandwiches- I got the chicken parm. After ordering and paying, we were told that we could have a seat in the dining area while we wait. What was supposed to be a quick dinner-run ended up being about a 30 minute wait to get our food. I ordered a drink to go and had to wait the whole thirty minutes before even getting my cup to fill up. Very annoying. The food really even wasn't that good, and the chicken tasted similar to that of Lean Cuisine chicken parm. Overall, pretty disappointed with Mama Gina's. I've heard the pizza is pretty good here, but I wouldn't have any experience to vouch for it.",

    "text": "Terrible food and we will never come here again. Their wings resembled something you would see in an anatomy class or body exhibit (See Pic). The few that were normal lacked all taste. Their pizza was undercooked and chewy. Save yourself and avoid this confused restaurant at all costs. The theme is all over the place... Some contemporary mixed with some traditional mixed with a bar that resembles a frat house and lastly add in big screen TVs and sports paintings on the glass storefront. Wow...",
