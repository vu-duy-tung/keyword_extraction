Quite honestly, I don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this place. They are always friendly, always quick, and the food has always been good. Are people mad that they have to pick up their food at the window or something?  I still love the salsa too.  Looking forward to my next visit!",

The beans and rice were bland. The quesadilla didn't have enough cheese which made the edges dry and hard. The El Cholo burrito had hardly any lettuce or tomato and the shredded beef inside of it was very salty. The guacamole appeared to have been made with cottage cheese which I really did not enjoy. As regular customers of the local \"-erto's\" chains, we will not be returning.",

I went up to the counter and told them they got my order wrong and I was told that they mix their beef with potatoes so what I got was the beef taco. 1. I was not told this when I ordered it - had I known it would be made with potatoes I would not have ordered it. 2. When I sat down and looked at it closer I could not find any beef in the potato mixture. Not only did it taste gross but I feel it was a bait and switch. Won't be back.",

If you are really craving Mexican food, unfortunately, this joint is about the only place in a 10-mile radius that is not a national chain (except Los Taquitos, which is much better than this place). Only good thing I can say about it is that the salsa is not bad. And if you are in need of a breakfast burrito, they aren't bad here either. Breakfast burrito is the only thing I would eat here. If you want tacos, though, and you are stuck in the Phoenix area, go to Los Taquitos near Safeway in Ahwatukhee.",

Pros: Large burrito, eggs were cooked quite well, fair price and value (~$6).  Cons: Nothing exceptional in the quality/flavor department.  All in all, a little bit on the higher said of 3 but not quite a 4. That being said, I do want to come back during breakfast hours to try a potato/chorizo burrito (yeahhhh buddy).",

It's like it came out of a juicer and what they serve you is the left over stuff in blender. I mean that's not real Mexican salsa. I'm from San Diego and even the worst taco place has better salsa then this place. Also they even have real red salsa.  I gave them 3 stars because the breakfast burrito is pretty good but without good salsa it's no Bueno. If any of you want to try great Mexican food go to Senor Taco their the best by far in AZ. Their originally from San Diego. Big portions and priced reasonably   So I have given this place another chance and tried their green chile pork burrito and I have to say I give that 4stars. Really good and spicy! Love the spiciness of it. I also tried their red pico de gallo type hot sauce and that's pretty good. Too bad they can't improve their green hot sauce because the red sauce isn't the type you can put on your breakfast burrito or carne asada burrito. At least I wouldn't.",

The place was pretty busy so we were surprised that the meat was over cooked, as if it had been sitting out awhile.   I ordered my taco without onions but it arrived with red onions on it. The cashier insisted there weren't onions on it. It went so far that I picked out an onion and put it up to her face and said \"smell it! It's an onion!\" (Meanwhile my husband is enjoying a good laugh) She did smell it, apologized and asked the kitchen to remake it. I know minimal Spanish but I could tell they were arguing about it with her. Then they smell it and agree to make me a new taco. Seriously - couldn't you SEE the red onions or at least look before arguing about it?  The hatch chile salsa is spicy but good. Red was typical, nothing special. My husband said his carne asada was dry and bland.   Based on dry meat and arguing about what they're serving me, not sure we will be back.",

    "text": "I have some mixed reviews about this place. I had the red chile pork burrito. It had good flavor, but when you take it to go the chile settles to the bottom, so it is best to eat it on a plate. Lots of meat and chile in this large burrito. Definitely good for two meals. Wish it has some cheese in it. This visit we were greeted my the most unfriendly cashier. Older lady with glasses. She did not seem welcoming, or in anyway too happy to answer any of our questions. My friend and I did notice that she seemed to be very nice to all the men. Women, had to go to the other staff there to get their needs met. She told my friend that her burrito did not come with chips when the menu clearly states that chips and salsa are included. I got a tiny bag of chips, and my friend got a much larger portion. Inconsistent. The salsa is tasty but does not really bring the heat.  I did try the carne asada burrito with guacamole another day that week. AMAZING!! Huge and definitely can take you for two meals or you can share it.   The following week work brought in breakfast burritos for the staff. I had the egg and sausage. Not a fan. Too much egg, did not like the sausage. I would not order this again.   The prices are reasonable. If you use credit cards, you do need to spent at least $5.00 or you won't be able to use it, or even a debit card too.  I did not ask for a container to take salsa away because I'd already been warned not to ask.",

    "text": "This place has broken me, as I quite literally can't eat a burrito anywhere else now.  Hands down the best red or green chile this side of Albuquerque.   I could literally create an entire lifestyle around eating these things. Sure, I would be dead of gout in a few years, but it would be totally worth it.  If you read any negative reviews on this place, they are all from Gringos, complaining that their \"California burrito\" wasn't up to their expectations. (Hint, if you are ordering a \"California Burrito\" your credibility as a food reviewer is pretty much shot)   Really, from someone who actually knows what Mexican food is supposed to taste like (Hint #2, it's not supposed to taste like a cob salad wrapped in a tortilla), don't listen to any of these uncultured nitwits.  This is the real deal.  Oh, and you know why they charge for extra salsa, fatty?  Because it is that good.  Coming from a world renowned salsa master, that is something.   This is the best spot for a burrito in the entire valley, but, I will warn you, don't do the green chile if you don't have the cojones to go all in, because it will put you down if you underestimate it.  Update: Apparently Gringos with no taste get offended when there is a good review of a restaurant across the street from a more trendy place. Don't get me wrong, that other place is okay, but just because Guy Fieri ate there, doesn't mean their tacos are worth waiting in a 30 minute line for.....  Oh, and if the Red Chile here was not good, then you literally have no tastebuds......",

The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, add guacamole. The chicken is so moist and tender. I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but I'm thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa.",

    "text": "Mention The Burrito Co. to anyone who is from or lives in Ahwatukee and they know exactly what you are referring to. Now that's name recognition.   Centrally situated between Tempe and the beginning of Ahwatukee, B-Co, as I like to call it, is a stone throw from the Elliot exit on I-10.   I'm very accustomed to eating at Amados, so I'm very much an enthusiast of the cheap burrito. B-Co knows how to make a good burrito and charge just a hair more than the Mexican all-night quick stops like Amados.  It's justifiable though considering you can eat on their private outdoor patio or inside where one has the luxury of a television and staff is okay if you change the channel to what you want to see. There are even customer bathrooms outside.   The downside to B-Co is the hours of the restaurant. It does not open on Sundays and if you plan on grabbing a late night snack after the club, the restaurant will be closed.  The Burrito Co. is also pretty skimpy on the amount of chips it gives out, which are by the way never greasy. Meals also take longer to cook than at Amados so you find yourself waiting around with your little number slip in hand moving strategically around the seating area trying not to get in people's way as they navigate the salsa bar or the fountain drink machine.   Still, service always seems to be friendly and having a punch card means that your hundredth or so burrito is free. And free is good, even in Ahwatukee.",

The burritos are great as well as other items on their menu. Their salsa bar is fresh and flavorful. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order on the menu.    The Original Burrito Company is in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you. The food is served in red plastic baskets and the cleanliness is about what you might expect, verifying its authenticity. Still, the price is very right for the meal. The employees are all really cool too.   This is a local favorite for Ahwatukee. But if you are expecting a bombshell, you may be disappointed. The Original Burrito Company is good and reliable. You can't go wrong with it.",

    "text": "I've been going to the burrito company for years. The #5 w/ guacamole, sour cream, and cheese is delicious. However lately I've noticed that they've started to slip with their customer service, and quality of food. Saturday 9/5/15 I came there with some friends, and we ordered our food to go, yet the lady that took our order gave half of our group their order to go, and the other half dine-in, and our receipts clearly said \"take-out\". That really wasn't a problem because mistakes happen. The issue was her attitude when we asked for our order to be wrapped to go. Clearly we didn't make the mistake so what's with the attitude??? Anyhow I didn't let that bother me I let it roll off my shoulders, and went back on Monday 9/8/2015. Before entering the facility there was a sign on the door that said \"Close early on Labor day at 2pm.\" We arrived around 12:30pm. We ordered the #5 (When made correctly is delicious), the cashier that helped us was very pleasant :)  However when we got our food it was COLD!!!! Now I expect the sour cream, and guacamole to be cold, however the carne asada was COLD, and hard!!! The cheese wasn't melted at all so that further let me know that the meat was cold. On top of that the tortilla shell was hard, and crispy...I was totally dissatisfied with my food. I wasn't going to write a negative review because I truly like this place. However yesterday's experience was disturbing. Remember they had a sign saying that they were closing at 2pm well patrons were trying to come inside, and order food but one of the workers locked the door at 1pm. Yesterday was a complete circus. I don't believe that I will be coming back here again. Which is sad because I've been coming here since 2002.",

Went their around 12 and noticed lil bit of a rush, but the line moved fast, so I wasn't worried.  I ordered the carne asada burrito with beans & guacamole, the guacamole was extra, because with the burrito you can choose either or, and I just was in the mood for beans, but also in my mind a carne asada burrito always comes with guacamole or avocado, pico de gallo and the tasty meat, so the chance to throw in beans, that made me happy. Just wondered why they would make you choose between the 2.  The flour tortilla seemed very fresh, the meat was delish, the guacamole, which was more like avocado and Mexican cheese blend was perfect, the beans over powered the burrito, next time I will pass on them, and it was lacking in pico de gallo.  The burrito came with chips & salsa, the chips were great, and the salsa, it was great with flavor but a little runner than what I like. I think I will go back and try something different.   I enjoy trying new places for lunch, and happy to add another on to my ever growing list.",

And quite frankly, the reason why you should never go to Chipotle, or any other imitation. This place is real.  Real enough to run into the owners of a business that has been around for 30 plus years. It makes a difference when the ownership cares so much, and it shows up in the service. I've never not once experienced less than super friendly service. Customers are welcome here, and there are plenty of regulars as a result.  My writing won't do the food justice, so I'll just say that you are getting the quality of food normally you would have to sit down and wait for; not to mention, the kind of food that would give your wallet a beating. However, you'll leave this place with your wallet not having as much as a scratch. Its all because they know how to offer value here.  Lastly, expect authenticity when you eat at this clean and comfortable establishment. The flavor that lands in your mouth from their artfully made carne asada burritos is no doubt due to REAL recipes. This ain't no \"On The Border\".   Plently of mexican restaurants to choose from in the area. Plenty of perpetrators. Stay away from those and eat here :).",

All the menu items are delicious you can't go wrong with anything that you choose. Be cautious on a Saturday morning you might have to wait a little due to the popularity of their amazing food... Trust me, it's worth the wait!   Alternatively you can call in your order, when you arrive you won't have to stand in line and you'll be able to go right to the front to pick up the delicious food that is waiting for you don't forget to pick up a large drink the size is good for two people!

When you order a custom $8 breakfast burrito don't ask for some chips. If you do, expect a cold stare and a only-if-you-pay smirky remark, and then when one protests, better have your receipt ready to show proof it was a custom order or they'll charge you extra! Really! I had to prove I actually ordered what I ordered for a few, free mediocre chips. My family and I will never be back, nor will we recommend to our friends.",

Our food is always hot, fresh and tasty, and the ladies at the counter are always nice and friendly. I personally really like their homemade salsas because they use extra cilantro and green onions. I also like the fact that they don't overdo the salt - unlike other places where you feel like you need to drink a gallon of water after your meal. I didn't realize this place was a staple in the neighborhood, and I only came across it because I got tired of being ripped off for skimpy burritos at Los Taquitos and America's Taco Shop. The interior is nothing special and can use a makeover, but where can you feed a family of 5 for under $30 - HERE! Today we came in for our burrito fix, and everything was great as usual. I'd definitely recommend giving them a try.",

The carnitas burrito was so-so when I ate the first half, but 7hrs later when I ate the second half, it was excellent.  Maybe it just needed some time to jell.      The beef hard shell tacos are very good.  The beef enchilada is a great deal at only $3 bucks  Their taco salad is also a steal at $5, it's a two meal salad.  Nothing fancy, but delicious, and the shell is perfectly fried and ungreasy  The red salsa is fantastic with almost enough heat.  Very fresh tasting, with plenty of cilantro and some diced onion.    I've gotta remember to try the horchata and the tortilla soup the next time I stop in.    It's probably the safest place in town at lunchtime, because there are almost always cops eating there, which is a good sign",

They offer two different types of salsa, a green tomatillo salsa, and a red tomato salsa with cilantro and green onions that has a nice kick to it.

I topped it off with sauces and jalapenos from the condiment bar. It came with some stock chips, nothing good but the salsa made them edible. The burrito however, yum! Fast service. Seemed like a hopping place, lots of people coming in. I'd go back!",

They are usually very fast, however, sometimes if you Call It In,  the wait can be long because they ARE very popular.  Easy to find in the EOS parking lot next to Walgreens with plenty of parking.  Portions are FANTASTIC for a GREAT PRICE!!!  Staff is mostly friendly, and more friendly the more they recognize you.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  When you have out of town guests over the Holidays, consider ordering breakfast and bringing it home!  Fairly priced, big portions, lots of flavor, easy clean up!  Mom says YES!!! PS I really LIKE their salsa:)",

    "text": "I've been eating here routinely since 1997, so it pains me to write a poor review on OBC, but this is no longer the OBC where I've been a loyal customer for 20 years. I usually eat here 4-5 times a week between breakfasts and late weeknight dinners.  I can only chalk it up to the recent employee change, because I honestly don't know how else to explain the sudden drop in food consistency, accuracy, restaurant condition, and general service.  The past 3 times I've been in over the last two weeks, my enchiladas has been abysmal. The chicken is cut into big bulky cubes (never happened until recently), the innards are cold, and on the cheese enchilada, the cheese not even fully melted, but more a coagulated glob. (Let's forget for a moment this place actually charges EXTRA to get enchilada sauce on a flippin' enchilada. That's a long standing ridiculous added fee. IT'S AN ENCHILADA. IT COMES WITH SAUCE EVERYWHERE EXCEPT HERE!)  I also order 1 red and 1 green tamale every time I go in, they have been dry and cold as well, really tasting as though they were thawed and warmed up in the microwave.  I've been in twice now about 1.5 hours prior to closing on a weeknight. Both times the iced tea is not being refilled for the evening, which is a pain because they have good tea and I can't drink soft drinks or drinks with sugar. I don't think 7:30-8pm is unreasonable to think I can sit down and have tea with my meal. When I complained I was informed by the gentleman at the counter that no one will drink it if they brew up more tea at night and they aren't going to waste it for one or two people to drink. Seriously? I can't even fathom how little brewed tea costs, but to deliberately not have it available for later dinner diners is ridiculous.  I've also twice in the past month had an entree not prepared when my order was called. Both times the guy at the counter asked me if I was sure I hadn't already grabbed it from the counter, an asinine question since both times I hadn't even left the counter with my trays.  My other observation is they like to shut down one of the dining area trash cans an hour or so prior to closing, presumably so only one near the counter needs emptied at closing. It's rude if you're seated on the north side of the dining room, but whatever. The sad part is that repeatedly the only can left open is literally then overflowing with trash. Not just near the top. Overfilled, a nice mound piled well above the rim, with items beginning to spill to the floor and nowhere to fit my family's trash at that point.  I don't know what happened in the last two months, but I really am disappointed. This was a long time family favorite, and in a handful of weeks I'm now doubting how much longer I will keep trying to make this work out. Please, OBC, get back on track!",

    "text": "LOVE this place! Been coming here with my dad since before I can remember after swim practices, and we became close friends with the owner, Becky, because of our frequent visits and unique attire (motorcycle gear, wet hair and swim suits). I recently went off to college and coming back, this place has changed. Becky is still running it beautifully, and the food is better than ever! But there is a front staff that leaves much to be desired. Just tonight, we went in about 30 minutes to close and ordered dinner to go. When we got home, we found that one of our burritos was missing. I tried to call the store three separate times and each time I got the voicemail, so I went back to get it before they left the store. When we got there, we knocked on the door and the girl sweeping said \"we're closed\". My friend then yelled through the door that we were missing an order. She seemed to understand and she headed back to the kitchen, but nothing happened. We stood there for 10 minutes watching these two girls finish cleaning up and turn out the lights before we knocked again. A manager or cook, I'm not sure which, came out to talk to us and we told them we were missing a burrito. He let us in and told the girl at the front desk and all she says is \"well make the burrito I guess\". This girl has always been quite rude and unpleasant whenever I come into contact with her, but this was just ridiculous. Who can leave a customer outside without even going to talk to them and make sure everything is okay when they are obviously trying to get their attention! I wish I knew her name!!   Don't get me wrong, this place is THE BEST, the food is amazing and it never fails to be Arizona's classic. I just wish their front staff would learn a little more about customer service. As a server, I know I'd never be able to behave that way and get away with it.",

    "text": "People that live in the east valley can sometimes talk fondly of this place. I never really realized it, since my only experience was of those occasions when I popped in and bought a quart of the red salsa, which is amazing.   So we decided to give it a full on evaluation. Chicken tacos and enchiladas, was a solid baseline.. or so I thought. Here is where it becomes tricky. The tacos was completely tasteless, and could go unnoticed completely if it wasn't for that super duper hard taco shell that surely did not improve the experience. Rice and beans did nothing for me, and the enchiladas - which was the highlight of the meal - was flavorless and uninteresting that too.   Now, I must start to evaluate why people raises this place to the high heavens and I conclude that there are two possibilities. Either it used to be the bomb and quality has degraded severely. Or it used to be the bomb out of pure lack of competition, and people climb to it's former relative greatness that simply doesn't hold up to today's standards.   Either way, if you like this place - don't worry, I will not be holding you up in line. I will not be there.",

    "text": "Amazing number of burrito choices!  I had the green chili burrito (only $3.65!) which was standard chili sauce, with chunks of tender pork.  There wasn't a LOT of meat, but for $3.65, it was a nice value. I also had their Mexican Chicken Soup, which was fairly unique.. it was very flavorful, and included a generous amount of cheese, and crema fresca..   My parents had fish, and shrimp tacos.. those tacos are HUGE! heh.  The staff didn't quite seem to be firing on all 8 cyls, and the dining room needed a serious sweeping/wipe down.  I guess they are in the process of adding a patio, and doing some remodeling, so that may have something to do with it.  Also, I was impressed with their tea selection.. two types of Tazo iced tea! :D Great place for a quick, inexpensive meal.",

I was wrong to have avoided it! We walked in, and the menu was large and obvious right in front of us. My brother looked and looked for something he wanted, and finally settled on an option, but had originally had his heart set on a breakfast burrito. We got up to the register (no line, yay!) and I saw that they had breakfast burritos, but was unsure if they were still offering them at 6:30 PM. My brother asked (and he is very shy about asking people things, so he speaks quietly and a bit unsteadily) and the woman behind the register was incredibly patient and kind.  He got his breakfast burrito (eggs and bacon and nothing else in a tortilla, and he absolutely loved it) and I got a BLT burrito (which sounds odd, but is fantastic. Bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo) and everything was great. Their seating area was cute, and had the patio not been under reconstruction, it would have been perfect to sit outside. Go to the Original Burrito Company, because the food is amazing and the staff are sweet. Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had!",

    "text": "You'd think it's hard to go wrong with a burro. Well, I've had my fair share of bad ones. But the chili rojo I got at the Original Burrito Co. was done right! Pork, rather than beef! Lots of it! Lots of the spicy sauce! Deliciousness abounds!  Also, take a note from me and be sure to read before doing.  Clearly, I don't pay attention as much as I should, but....  ...When I see a bar of salsa, my first instinct is to run...toward it. Then of course I realize that there are only paper cups without lids to put said salsas and pico in. When you've got an order to-go, this could be tricky. Then you might notice the sign that says that salsa comes prepackaged with your to-go meal. I am such a ditz sometimes.  Anyway, after a few mix-ups, and me being a nervous and easily embarrassed person, we finally got home with the goods. And like I already said, everything was pretty solid. The salsa was nice and spicy with good flavor, although I thought the tomatoes in the pico were a little mushy. The tostadas looked pretty nice, too.  The menu was also pretty expansive, and I'm sure any of their burritos, platters, or tacos are excellent.",

The Original Burrito Co. is a great little mexican restaurant located in an otherwise forgettable strip mall (A liquor store and Gold's Gym being the anchors).  The food is priced well and you can easily feed two for under ten dollars.  The burritos themselves are generous in size and tasty, to boot.  I really like their green chile and carne asada offerings.  The inside is very small, looking more like a take-out place than a real restaurant.  You can sit outside, however, and I would recommend this is the weather permits.  There is no other place in the area I'd rather get a quick mexican meal, for sure.",

    "text": "I like two kinds of breakfast burritos, depending on which mood i'm in: 1) A burrito loaded with spicy meat, peppers, cheese, potatoes, eggs, everything! Usually doubles as lunch. Usually hurts afterwards. 2) A super breakfast-y eggy, cheesy burrito with a decent yet not overwhelming amount of meat, and a more stomach-friendly amount of spice.  Burrito Company is the latter, and they do that type of burrito well! I like  to order the egg, bacon, and cheese, then add in as much salsa as I'm feeling like. The salsa here is thin but full of flavor, and also cilantro. It will clear your sinuses but not burn your mouth. The chorizo is also yummy, but the orange grease isn't all that appealing.   Aside from breakfast, the food is good but not authentic. Think Filibertos but not as greasy and no russian-roulette food poisoning games. The Super Nachos are loaded with cheese, salsa, guac, and sour cream and will be appreciated by nacho lovers everywhere. The box it comes in weighs over a pound. The quesadillas are made on the giant tortillas folded over and over. Tasty and almost sure to induce a Mexifood-nap.   Burrito Company is worth a visit for a breakfast burrito, and is one of the most well-known spots in the area- it is one of the oldest businesses in the strip mall in which it resides. Stop by, support a local business, and enjoy the food!",

Back then it was great, and it was consistent. The thing that drove me nuts about this place was the salsa. Very cilantro-ish and it did a great job on your nasal cavity.  Carne asada fries, egg potato cheese burrito, barbacoa burrito, and the carne asada burrito are all very good. My all-time favorite is the $18, eggs potato cheese. VERY GOOD. this is my standard for breakfast burritos everywhere else I go.  The only reason I give this place a 4-star is because recently the salsa has been very inconsistent. One day I went and the salsa was extremely watery and gross. The chips are consistently gross, but what good is that without amazing salsa. They moved like 20 feet, and the new place is much nicer, but the food quality has gone down a bit. Last night my GF and I went close to closing time, and we didn't get very good food. The steak was more like barbacoa, and the potatoes were more like mashed potatoes (we got a steak potato cheese for my GF). Not very appealing.  This place used to be a staple for me, and I wouldn't think twice about going there. But recently, I don't know what has happened. The old lady that works there is very nice, but I just don't know what is going on to what used to be my favorite non-chain mexican food place in phoenix.  *sigh* I hope they find their consistency again. For a place to be 5-stars for me, it HAS to be consistent. Right now, its lacking.",

Probably should wait to do this when there aren't people eating at tables - kinda gross.  My biggest issue is that I LOVE carne asada fries so I ordered them here.  Well as I posted in my pic - I got uncooked floppy fries covered with a thin puree of avocado with cotija cheese chunks mixed in, topped with about a 1/4 cup of carne asada and pico de gallo.  The floppy fries killed me.  It's unforgivable.  They can fry a decent tortilla chip (maybe their pre-bought) so why not fry a crispy fry?

They are like $3, they are HUGE, they taste amazing (tortilla, eggs, cheese, meat...how could you go wrong?), and you can get them any time of day (my favorite part). I always stop by this place when I'm in the area.",

I ordered the chorizo, potato, egg burrito and added cheese.  You can ask for a whole wheat tortilla as well.  M had the bacon, egg, cheese burrito and they chopped up the bacon, not like some places that use 2 long flimsy half cooked bacon strips in their burritos.  Plus our burritos were under $4 each! You order at the counter in the front and listen for your number.  The place was simple, self serve drinks/ coffee.  There were enough tables, booths, plus some outdoor seating to accommodate the morning crowd.   Next time, we will share a burrito.",

After putting my prejudice away on not having tartar sauce with a fish burrito, I was not pleased with the burrito. I let the girl know about my concern and she brushed it off like I'm crazy. I told her that it's the same thing as having pizza without red sauce. You must have tartar sauce with fish taco or burrito.

Love the burritos and tacos  --- the homemade chips are delicious and the salsa bar is scrumptious stocked with two types of freshly made salsa which is simply AMAZING! So why 3 stars? theres a disconnect between order taker and when order is prepared and twice my order has been wrong. Also, they seem not to care about ways to be relevant. when I want there for national taco day expecting there to be a taco discount/specials, there was none. The manager, who is taking my order, said she didn't even know it was national taco day and was laughing about it. totally not funny when I could've gone to Cafe Rio or another mom-and-pop taco place. Also, if you want to order your food ahead of time you can only call it in. They are not associated with Uber eats or any of these types of apps. Also although there is a physical drive-through attached to the building, the drive-through has been converted to a patio so you have to get out of your car. Needs work on modernizing and customer service for sure. I just checked my receipt and realized they charge me for lettuce and cheese I did not get. Again customer service and accuracy of order is paramount. now downgrading to two stars.",

Really glad I gave them another try because my Chicken Chimi was super-yummy, with melted cheese, a side of sour cream and tomatoes, as well as rice and beans. I also got a side of chips and guacamole. Good stuff. Good prices.

The service is average, and most of the time they keep the tables clean during lunch rush.  My favorite is the Barbacoa enchilada style (about $7.50), it's filled with tender Mexican BBQ beef, green onions and tomatoes.

This shop is a little unexpected.  It's posted in a strange shopping complex by an EOS and a Walgreens and in another life, I might have just driven right by.  I opted to check it out, on the hunt for a worthy taco.    I ordered the four different kinds of tacos-- chorizo, chicken, carne asada & pork.  The little tacos were topped with a mix of onion and cilantro.    Salsa bars can make or break a taco situation.  They only have two salsas-- your basic green and red sauce.  I had hoped for more creativity!  But you get what you get.  I was pretty disappointed.  The chorizo, well, I did enjoy.  The meat packed a lot of punch and spice.  But the other meats were super dry, especially the pork.  It was almost like it's was the end of the day so the cooks stopped caring.  Bummed but I'll move on.  I will say, their burritos are pretty good so maybe stick to their namesake instead of venturing into uncharted waters.",

It looks like it has a little patio area also to enjoy some good food.   Walking into the restaurant, they have a open floor with lots of tables. They have a full salsa bar with green, red salsa and even Sriracha. Checking out the menu plenty of choices but I was here for the bean and cheese. I did check out some of the other orders that came around like the taco salad, it looked like a ton of food. I got my bean and cheese to go and it was much bigger than I thought. It even came with chips which was unexpected and appreciated. The burrito was pretty delicious and the tortilla was a bit on the dry side but adding a little salsa will do the trick. I do wish I could of just got the burrito enchilada style but it was around $3 which is close to the price of the burrito itself. Regardless good burrito, but not something that would make me go out of way to get.   All around good place for good Mexican food. I do think I'm basing my review on just one item which was good and if I'm in the area again, I would give them a shot again",

When someone's making burritos and not on their game and ingredients get omitted...the place is not so good.  I've eaten here for years, and this is the way it has pretty much always been.  Service and food lack consistency here...I hate to say it because this is the one of the closest, fairly legit burrito restaurants in my area.  To be fair, I mainly visit the Original Burrito Company during what is probably their peak hours, weekend mornings...usually after a ride or hike at South Mountain.  I've gone in there and been greeted by the friendliest people around and served the food I ordered and expected.  Other times I've gone in there and the cashier obviously had a rough night the night before or didn't get enough coffee that morning, but for whatever reason they are angry and rude.  Unfortunately, the service and food quality do not correlate.  I've gotten good food on a bad service day, and I've gotten not so great food on a great service day...there's no rhyme or reason.  I feel like The Original Burrito Company never really returned to the glory they once had, before they were forced into a new building by landowners several years ago.  Regardless, the burritos are good enough to play the game of chance...even when they forget to put cheese on my burrito, it's not the end of the world.  I remain hopeful that one day, these guys will finally get their act together all the way around and I can go in there with the expectation of good food and good service!",

So, of course when I get to my car with my red chicken burrito (chicken, rice and red sauce), no chips were included. I did go back inside and get my chips. Also, the mother who cooks, gave me a sample of the red chili, but failed to mention that the sauce has pork inside (not my favorite). Apparently, they have a second red sauce without pork for the people who order a chicken burro. I ended up eating half and it was just a normal, not memorable burrito. Prices are mostly under 6 bucks, so you don't feel ripped off (unless you get no chips.)",

They had a great variety of fare to suit your taste.  You can go authentic or a bit non traditional and it is always made right.  They make some of the most perfect breakfast combos you could want. Since moving away we always use OBC as the measuring stick when we get burritos.  Still have not found any place that measures up.   My favorites, the Fish Burrito, the Veggie Mixto and the Marco Polo.  But try them all!",

When I say 'somewhat', what I'm alluding to is that there is often a certain charm that remains in the details of any original establishment.   In this case, the little patio area with the fountain is no more.  But on the whole, it's a step up.  Chorizo, chorizo, chorizo.  Somebody in the talk forum started a thread about chorizo and another yelper mentioned The Original Burrito Co as having the goods.  I had to find out.  The verdict: it's good and I like it.    Their chorizo is about what you expect when you close your eyes and conceptualize what chorizo is supposed to taste like.  It has a subtle spiciness but is not too vinegary or salty.  When folded into eggs dashed with papas everything works together in a complimentary cloud of Sonoran awesomeness rolled into a tortilla.    I had '#14:The combination - chorizo con huevos y papas'.  No regrets.  Two salsas are available in the salsa bar, a red and green, along with sliced, pickled jalapenos.  I like the fact that they give you a small bag of chips with your order.  I'm definitely coming back to try their red and green chile as they boast both of these entrees to be made with a New Mexican flair.  That could be a critical turning point in my criteria but I'll remain the optimist and base my return on the delicious breakfast burro I got here.",

When I looked them up here on Yelp and saw slightly under four stars I was taken aback. Who could give a low rating to this place? Even if the Soup Nazi was the owner, the quality and quantity for the money should put it over four stars. I NEVER go to the same restaurant twice in two days, but yesterday and the day before I stopped here--the second day because I was just curious about the other stuff on their menu. I should mention I live about ten miles from here.   It started on Monday when I was bringing my son back from the doctor near Ahwatukee. It occurred to me as we left that I had lived in Ahwatukee twice before (I'm now in Tempe) and never tried the Original Burrito Company. I decided to rectify the situation.  I don't think this place is ever slow, but I caught them at a good time. There was no one in line in front of me, though the counter person was doing other stuff and took a couple of minutes to greet me--more on this later. I opted for the carne asada burrito. It arrived in a few minutes and it was AWESOME! When I think burritos I typically think FLATULENCE because 9 times out of 10 they are 50% beans at the very least. Here, with this particular burrito, they give you an option of either beans or guacamole. I went for guacamole and it came out to about 85% carne asada (yummy), 10% guacamole (good), and 5% salsa verde (excellent and spicy). This was $4.50 including chips.   The next day my wife and I stopped by. I had the red chili burrito and my wife had the pollo con chili rojo y arroz. Mine was $3.65 and hers was $4.45, including chips, and both were awesome. Again, both were stuffed with the main ingredients and not a bunch of beans and other fillers. Somebody here mentioned that they are skimpy on the ingredients, but I have found the exact opposite to be True on my two visits. Maybe when that reviewer visited they were training a new employee.   The only drawback that I can find is the service. It is not bad, but not super friendly or real attentive. No one greeted me when I walked in and both times it took the woman behind the counter a couple of minutes to say anything to me. But once she started taking my order all was well.   For anyone wanting no-frills Mexican--burritos in particular--this place is Heaven.",

I haven't tried anything else here yet, but the word on the street is just stick to the breakfast burritos and go to Los Taquitos down the street for your other meals.  Meal:  I always try a new breakfast item when I am here but I think I have cycled through all of them already.  Don't judge me too harshly, this place is right on my way to work!  Taste:  I believe it is a well known scientific principal that no breakfast taco can taste bad.  But that isn't to say that all breakfast burritos are created equally!  The OBC's burros are magnificent creations that make all things in the world right.  10 out of 10.  Value:  The burritos are slightly bigger than what your would expect for the price.  Any bigger, they would be impossible to consume without a knife and fork.  And honestly, who eats burritos with knives and forks?  5 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  Maybe I don't put a big enough smile on my face when I walk in but the person who takes my orders always seems to be in a rotten mood.  Sometimes it takes a long time to get my burro and I have lost tracked on how many times people who put their order after me and got theirs before mine came out.  If it happens one or twice, I understand, but almost all the time?  Come on, man!  6 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Nothing special, that's for sure.  There is really no way to comment on their atmosphere when there really is no atmosphere.  1 out of 5.  Overall:  If you stick to the breakfast burritos, you will be safe.  Going outside of the safe will only lead to a broken heart.  22 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars.",

Their refried beans were a disgrace. The only flavor you tasted was salt. They were way too bland. The other family we were with didn't really care for their food either, except the one that had the green chili burrito.   Besides the food greatly lacking, the service was even worse! The cashier, a teenage female seemed grumpy. My whole family commented on her bad attitude. When I asked if there was chicken broth in the rice, the other cashier told her it's probably just water, just tell her water. The grumpy cashier at least asked, and we did find out they use chicken broth. I also asked for the kid's tacos to be ONLY beans and cheese. They ended up being a lot of the crappy beans, barely a sprinkle of cheese, and a ton of lettuce. Apparently that order was too difficult to relay...and that's probably why they say \"no substitutions.\"   If you want good service and good Mexican food, go down the street to Macayo's.",

I was surprised how busy this little store front was on a Saturday at 7. It is not fancy, it is a step above your average berto/beto experience. There is a large menu on the wall that takes a bit of time to get a handle on. there is indoor and a large patio for seating.   I went with the fish burrito that some of my fan boyrito friends suggested.  less than $5  My burrito came the tortilla was soft yet had a nice crust from grilling, the burrito had a sufficient amount of fried fish, lettuce and the fresh taste from peppers and onions. It came with some nice thinker chips. There is a salsa bar with some great salsa to compliment the chips but to my chagrin no drinkable picante style sauces.  Also note they are moving soon to a remodeled KFC in the same complex so the patio arrangement may change.  There was quite a wait conciderign the naTrue of this plaace,",

Friendly family atmosphere, clean, fast, great prices, and delicious! First time I ordered a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada w/side or rice. Homemade corn taco shells were great! Very hearty taco. Beef was flavorful and juicy. The enchilada w/green sauce had a nice bite to it. Loved the garnishing on top - paired well together. Authentic rice! I love Spanish rice and this was legit! My husband loved his macahca burrito! 2nd visit I ordered the taco salad. It was GIANT and hearty! Delicious, flavorful shredded chicken with perfect toppings. Their guacamole is great! Horchatas are good too! Nice kids menu options. Definitely our New Mexican food go to eatery. The staff was very friendly and welcoming on both visits. And they do Taco Tuesdays for .99!",

You can get a breakfast burrito for about $3 and they are huge! They'll even give you free chips, and you can head over to the salsa bar and indulge as much as you want.   So far I've tried the Sausage, egg, and cheese b-fast burrito (add potato) and the Carnitas burrito, which has provided comfort given the ongoing Chipotle debacle and their nationwide shortage of \"Properly Raised\" pork.

    "text": "So here we are, Tuesday night dinner and I'm not really hungry.  I mean I've normally got a healthy appetite (healthy appetite -you know, something more than just a salad or a nibble of something)  but tonight I'm not so hungry so I ask if I can split a quesadilla with hubby.   Steak please.  He comes home with that thing and at first I'm thinking this isn't right cuz the container is too light.  Yes I know a tortilla, cheese, and beef really shouldn't weigh a lot.  Don't ask me what I was thinking.  Besides, by then it was probably my stomach talking. Opened it up and revealed the toasty, fragrant tortilla with Mexican cheese and chunks of beef.  *inhale*  A small nibble and my taste buds were telling me to stop multi tasking and just eat.  The tortilla was darn near perfect tonight.  The cheese was buttery, and not too much either.  And the ideal amount of tender beef was included.  The green salsa caught me by surprise tonight.  A little fire there.  I used almost an entire bullet for a half of my meal.  I don't understand, I really wasn't that Hungry tonight. I still had to have some red salsa.  I was torn.  The quesadilla was delicious by itself.  Warm, toasty tortilla with cheese and beef.   Mmm mmm. And here I wasn't very hungry. This place is consistently good.   Fresh salsas. Green Chile Burritos. Breakfast Burritos. Thin, crispy, tortilla chips. And the staff is courteous,  knowledgeable,  and have been pleasant every time I've been there. It all keeps me (us) coming back for more.",

The meat was shredded but it was clumpy (is that a word?) and would stick to the roof of my mouth. My boyfriend had a taco of each of their meats, and he was surprised that even the carne asada was bad. Who messes up carne asada?  Take it from a Mexican who knows Mexican food and skip on this joint.",

    "text": "To me, this place is almost like an upscale filibertos. It has a real quaint and nice home style environment that's very inviting. But sadly it stops about there. I tried one of the breakfast burritos because everyone else rants about them and to be honest it couldn't shake a stick at one from filibertos. The overall burrito was somewhat small and the potatoes were simply mushy, not really holding any form. I wasn't really pleased by my experience but I decided to try it another day (chips and salsa are chips and salsa, can't really mess that up)  About a week later I went back for a three rolled taco combo. Surprisingly, they managed to take the deep frying step and double the length of it I assume, leaving them in too long. I was at the end of the lunch rush is that helped any. What should have been crispy/soft rolled tacos turned into thick tough chips filled with meat.  I was too disappointed and just ready to wash my hands clean of the place so I didn't raise a fuss.   All in all, it's a personalized filibertos that offers chips and salsa with most meals. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be healthy mexican food but either way it wasn't that tasty for me. I'm glad the rest of you had good experiences.",
