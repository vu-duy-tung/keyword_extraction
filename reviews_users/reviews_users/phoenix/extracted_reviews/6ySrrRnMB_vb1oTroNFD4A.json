    "text": "I stopped by this place after having went to Butters, which is in the same complex. Now I'll admit, my coffee tastes aren't sublime- I tend towards more Starbucks than not. Horribly mainstream, sad to say. And you'll find going in that the menu is quite spartan, without complicated descriptions, which leave you... having to ask the counter staff, gasp!   No fear. They're super nice. I actually did ask for a macchiato the first time I was there, and when the guy made sure it was what I wanted the clueless, blank look on my face prompted him to ask me a couple more questions. To which I ashamedly admitted that when I think macchiato it means I just want something like my skinny caramel one at Starbucks. But he just smiled, said no problem, and jumped right into it! And man it was delicious. He did say something about vanilla and caramel and whatnot, but really, it was just delicious, and that is that.  He also mentioned that they add 2 espresso shots in there, not just one. So voila! More bang for your buck.  The place is a really neat little joint. The decor is great, I love the art for sale on the walls and the teal velvet armchair by the front door. The outside is also dog friendly, which is very, very nice. Now I don't live anywhere south Scottsdale, unfortunately, but I do like this place enough that it warrants a stop in anytime I'm in the locale.",

    "text": "OK, I didn't want to have to do this, but there are some idiots who don't have brains to blow out, though they should try (was that too harsh?)  I lived the last 4 years in Seattle. I *KNOW* what good coffee is. In Seattle, I lived across the street from Cafe Vivace and worked a block from Cafe Vita, and walked my poodle past Stumptown. I probably drank enough coffee to kill a herd of hipster buffalo during that time, and I don't remember sleeping much. My point: I'VE GOT COFFEE CRED.  I've tried some other indie coffee joints around, but the Village Coffee Roastery makes THE BEST in AZ. in my not-so-humble opinion.   The service is GREAT, the place is clean. I haven't eaten any of the baked stuff or sandwiches, so I can't vouch for that. Seems other people I observed like it well enough. But, that's all just window-dressing to the main attraction : COFFEE.   So if you are expecting Mc.Crappy coffee or StarCrap's coffee, you may be disappointed because your tastebuds are on ass-backwards.   But, if your mouth is not paralyzed and you know what good coffee actually is and tastes like, then you will love this place.   Just tell Kent I sent you, and he'll serve you up just right.",

Let me tell you how long I have been looking for an alternative to a regular coffee shop that is in Scottsdale and serves better drinks than Starbucks.  I think the reason I love this place so much is the alternative drink options:  my personal favorite is the Almond Milk Chai Latte.  Yes that is right a latte not made from cows milk, but almonds instead.  It is creamy and delicious!  I get mine with a shot of espresso added.  The quiche is fantastic as well.

They also have tasty sandwiches-my personal favorite is the Caprese because the pesto sauce is awesome and you can't go wrong with mozzarella cheese. However, I did give 4 and not 5 stars because they used to serve their sandwiches on a baguette which I was always down for, but have recently switched to panini style. This would be fine (I mean, who am I to resist a great panini?) but the temperature of the mozzarella comes out in limbo between warm and cold and the contrast is a little...unpleasant. The ingredients are still of great quality though.  Also, I would not recommend Village Roastery for studying as they keep the lights pretty dim inside and there are not many outlets available to use a laptop. I've read other reviewers remark that it is too noisy, but honestly that has never been an issue for me, even while studying. If you are looking for a quick, gourmet lunch paired with a velvety, luxurious mocha, definitely stop by Village Coffee Roastery!",

This is one of my go to spots when in the area because they don't over charge for a cup of coffee and refills are 50 cents. Other spots in the area don't offer this. Plus they have a special card where you get a free coffee if you put some money on that card (kind of like a Starbucks card, can't remember details). Much better coffee then the bitter coffee found at a spot in the area that over charges and is served with an attitude.",

    "text": "Pros:  - best smooth DECAF drip coffee I've ever tasted (included milk/milk substitute/sweetener).   - 3 sugar-free SAUCES (in addition to SF syrup choices) these sugar free choices are rare at coffee shops. - intimate, cozy, unique coffee-shop feel. no bright lights - pastries good & unique, has a crustless quiche.  Tasty eggs and bacon. Though coffee is main attraction.  Cons: - depending on the day and number of customers inside, it can get pretty loud. - animal allergy sufferers, like myself, have issues with the close proximity of dogs to your table or chair. Living in Scottsdale you know dogs in food places is getting more common unfortunately.   - Never know when there will be a wait of 5+ people standing in front of you.  Challenge to gauge if you are in a hurry, particularly in the morning. Even with wait coffee was quick, but eggs and bacon took about 20+ minutes. - Drip coffee is reasonably priced i.e. $2.45 + tax, medium cup.  But quickly gets expensive, i.e. $4 if you add steamed milk and syrup/sauce - husband didn't care for decaf with SF syrup (sauce is undoubtedly better). I tried twice for him, second time regular coffee with hazelnut shot.  Nope, he won't convert from Coffee Bean.   I've been here maybe 15 times over the last few months, I fell in love with it the first time I went. If you know and accept the pros and cons, you'll love it.  Staff are not overly friendly yet pleasant as they work quickly to serve you. That comment is neither positive nor negative, maybe good service is more accurate. FYI if you get almond milk it can't be too hot (previous poster) soy or cows milk can be heated above almond milk temperature.  Suggestion to owner - try using fettuccini for coffee stirs ( some Canadian and Costa Rican coffee shops have changed to this earth-friendly option)",

It sounds trivial and silly but trust me: clean coffee is (more often than not) good coffee. If the grinders and machines are well cared for, then you know, more likely than not, the baristas are also taking care of the coffee. The shots being pulled seemed inconsistent and under or over extracted. It definitely tasted over extracted in my mocha, and even the chocolate couldn't salvage the drink's dignity.   Customer service was relatively sweet--at least one employee's attitude compensated for the others'. But for specialty coffee, it only seemed like they had all the right equipments for the show, but no one knew how to use them properly.",

She'll tell you she's charming.   Between my house and place of work there are at least 20 different options for coffee. The usual suspects: Starbucks, Coffee Bean, some local jobs, and even a strangely placed Dunkin Donuts. I go in the wrong direction every morning to go here though. They're fast. Even faster now that I have a pattern of ordering. The latte is usually waiting on the bar for me by the time my card gets processed.   And that, my friends, is why I have become the Duchess of this fine establishment and lived happily ever after in the Land of (soy) Milk and Honey.   (ok, that last part is a touch dramatic, but seriously, it's good here. Go.)",

I don't come to Scottsdale as often as I used to, but I needed to sit down, fill out some paperwork and have a cup of coffee before I went into an interview at the crack of dawn this morning.  I stumbled upon this place completely by accident, and it was one of the better coffee shops I've been to in these parts.  For starters, even on a weekday at 7:30 in the morning, this place was packed! There was a group of bikers (pedal bikes not motor bikes) that had just come in from an early ride all sitting outside drinking coffee and hanging out.  The inside was full of people doing what they needed to do, all professional looking. Clearly, this is the place to be!  I went with an iced coffee and a slice of banana bread to hold my stomach down while I quickly filled out some paperwork.  The staff was friendly and courteous. Despite being busy, my drink and food were ready in a jiffy.  I didn't hear them call my drink order, but the girl realized when I poked my head up from the table that I must have been looking for the coffee she just poured.    Place is nicely decorated, and has a full menu of items.  Pricing is decent, and there's plenty of places to sit, indoors and out.  Bathrooms were clean and ready to use, and overall a positive experience. I think they also have free wifi! Check this place out if your in the area....",

There's unique art and photography for sale and on the walls of the Village Roastery.   My first trip I order a Large iced, non fat latte to test out their coffee. Perfectly done...no burning or over-roasting detected. I tried a shot of espresso, also the same day. Second trip was equally great. Third trip the guy's already asking, \"do you want your usual?\". I switched it up and went with a hot drink for a change of pace.   Every trip was consistent and excellent. I really like the ambiance and I LOVE their coffee!",

Service was friendly.  Now, on the down side.  They toasted my bagel without asking, and I prefer plain.  Assumed it would be that way, unless I requested otherwise.  Besides, isn't it their job to ask which we want?  I ordered it with cream cheese in hopes, that since they serve full breakfast, they would have spread it on for me. I dislike getting the cheap little packet of cream cheese and having to spread it on myself on a take out order for the car.  They also used some lousy, cheap no name cream cheese which was tasteless.  Then they throw the bagel lose into the brown paper bag without a styrofoam container or plastic wrap.  Then I tasted the coffee, with great anticipation since they are a \"world famous\" coffee house, and couldn't have been more disappointed.  I am not even a big coffee drinker and don't necessarily want it strong, but this one was like drinking water.  Totally flavorless.  And my personal pet peeve is when there is no Sweet'n Low option.  I do not like the other sweeteners, but that's just me.  Oh yes, one more dislike, they charge .75 cents to add butter to your bagel.  I know they are not alone, but is that not the biggest rip off of all time?  And I would suspect, like the cream cheese packet, that they would have tossed in one little gold foiled butter pat that costs them .3 cents, if that.  I am adding 1 star more than I should, because the place was cute and the server was friendly.",

If you chat up a barista I'm sure they'll tell you all about the precision that goes into their roasts -- it's amazing.  Coffee is truly done right here!  Be sure to try an espresso if you're passing by since their house blend is quite fantastic, but even if you're not an espresso fanatic their latte's, mocha's, etc. are all top notch.  You will not be disappointed!    And, Steve is totally correct, if they aren't sold out of Misty Valley it's a once-in-a-lifetime cup.  Very strong blueberry note as an espresso shot, with a rich finish like any good African single origin.  You'll be hard pressed to find anything like this anywhere else.",

This place reminds me of a place in Seattle called Espresso Vivace.   So onto why I give 1 star. Well my use to be favorite barista I just described picked his nose then got my bagel with his bare hands ready to spread cream cheese on it.  OH HELL NAW, I DON'T PLAY THAT SHIT.

    "text": "Take my general dislike of animals and add a little OCD to the mix.  Then ask me what happens when you walk into the local coffee shop and see three dogs.  One sitting in a chair that customers have to sit in, one on top of the coffee table that customers have to but their food on and the final 150-lbs Great Dane that I watched lick the shoulder of an unsuspecting women seated in a chair.  Well, its time to call some people out and ask the business owner what part of the AZ Health Code they don't understand.    Listen, I understand that we are living in a time in which everyone thinks they can do whatever they want, whenever they want because they are individuals and having general rules in society somehow take their civil rights away from them, but really, 150-lbs dog in a tiny coffee shop without one employee saying, \"hey, outside with the dog.\"    I remember the days growing up as a kid when I would pet the dog or two chained outside the doors of the grocery store or ice cream store.  Today, I can just reach over to the counter where the food is served and pet the them, while the employee behind the counter, having to wear a hair net, doesn't say a word.    The bonus to my morning was when the Great Dane's owner plopped down right in the middle of the outdoor patio, next to where I was sitting, and I got to watch a giant line of drool flap around the dog's mouth until it almost hit the ground.  But right before it did, the dog turned his head and it landed on the table next to where we were sitting.  Awesome!  Next time your food drops onto a table, think about this story before popping it in your mouth.    Oh buy the way, the coffee and assorted drinks are excellent, as are all of their food items.  So, if you can take a little doggy DNA in your food, try the place out, it's quite good.  I would normally give it 5 stars if not for the Wildlife Zoo theme they have doing on inside with all the canines.",

Now I've had some great coffees around the country from places like these but one soon forgets how a great fresh roast tastes.  Had the Espresso Con Panna, which I have to say was blissful.  Freshness, balance of the espresso and the cream with a hint of sugar was perfect.  Roasting your own coffee and grinding it fresh does wonders for the taste.    My significant other had the Iced Chai which again was amazing.  Great flavors and you actually taste different spices vs. the norm of a glorified over sweet one note Chai.  Will definitely be back and glad there are still businesses that take the time and pride themselves on a delicious product.  Also other pluses...free wi-fi, great atmosphere with local artists and super friendly staff.  So next time, why Starbucks???",

I had a mocha made with chocolate hazelnut milk over ice, which is dairy free. I loved it.  The selection they had was amazing, like Vietnamese and Brazilian coffees. I obviously don't know much about the different kinds of coffees but it was worth every sip. Thank you!",

The place was packed on a Saturday morning but the waitstaff were getting people through quickly.  Coffee was flavorful and just like we ordered.  While it's not the best local roasted coffee I've ever had it was good, fast and well presented.    Ambiance of the roastery was what one would expect and indicative to the coffee culture.  Plenty of parking available in the area and easily accessible.  If you're looking for a good cup of fresh roasted coffee this would be a good stop instead of the chain coffee shops that appear to be on every corner these days.",

They roast their own beans, the employees are super friendly and everything from food to drinks is delicious! I've had their breakfast burrito (delicious!), some of their muffins (pumpkin was amazing) and their hot/iced lattes.   On the weekends they get really busy and have a live musician playing out front where you can sit and enjoy. Despite being super busy, they still get your food/drinks prepared quickly and with a smile. I've never had a bad experience here and this coffee spot is in my rotation. I will definitely be back!",

It was some good joe so I dropped 50 cents in the refill jar for a 2nd fill.   The kale had a mango dressing, feta, dried cranberries and a sprinkling of pistachios.  Small for the price (Maybe they gave me the small size by mistake) as I later learned you can have any of their menu salads as a side to a sandwich order. Now that's a deal! Next time...   For midday, midweek reading it's not ideal unless you can deal with the noise. Each table was packed with small business meetings.  Friendly attentive, service from all staff.   I would definitely go back for a sandwich/salad combo or for a causal meeting spot!",

    "text": "Been wanting to check this place out as my hubby and I are always on the hunt for a cool place to just chill and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, but Garmin always leads us to the wrong corner of the intersection. Finally found it, with a little bit more patience.  It really wasn't that hard to find, our Garmin was just a bit directionally challenged ;)  THE PLACE: It is quite smaller than I had expected. It was just really a long rectangular area, with the barista station of equipments, kitchen, counter and food display case monopolizing the right side of the space. Directly to the right of the door as you enter, is a nice comfy space for customers to lounge, mingle, and access the network. And that they did. The place was semi-packed at 12:30 pm today. The left wall was lined with different size tables of different heights. And those too were filled with customers enjoying a sip of java or tea. Noise level wasn't really that bad, just people talking. I think there might have been music, but I can't recall now.  THE SERVICE: Was just okay. I played the first timer and asked what offerings they had that were iced that she would recommend. The gal behind the register looking quite bemused by my ignorance simply said \"weellll\" they really only had 1 iced coffee they offer, and if I was looking for a latte. Saying yes, she suggested vanilla to always be good. So I got a large iced one with soy. She didn't ask for a name to put on the cup (okay, I admit, I'm coffee chain trained, but if the system worked, why not?!) and was a bit worried I will not get my coffee. I did not wait very long though, and barista looks at me and says this is your bevy. Okay, cool. Where may I get a cover? Points me cooly to the condiment station conveniently located by the entrance/exit.  THE COFFEE: Was good. Not something overly exceptional, but good otherwise. Love that they use eco-friendly cups. That's a win.    I'll be honest, 5.2 miles for a cup of joe and the so-so experience, I'll stick to my conveniently located faves. Hey, but now I know.",

On this day, we had the old guy who every 8 minutes would make a strange vocal noise that sounded like he was a walrus in distress. The tables are real close, so expect to hear other conversations, run across plates from the last dude that sat there and the flies visiting you. I managed to drink a cup of coffee and have the standard breakfast burrito before the Walrus drove me way and so did the Canadian visitors reveling in my AZ sunshine. The almost 6 buck burrito wasn't really worth half that price, but the burro was good enough for a small meal and the coffee (mostly dark choices) were average. The coffee fixing area needs some adjustment and TLC as it looks out of place and the communal table in the front is pretty uncomfortable for all involved. Eggs were fluffy and bacon crunchy, so it wasn't that bad of a morning stop, but would have rather had a better patio crowd.",

    "text": "I went to the Village Coffee Roastery on a busy Saturday morning and was pleasantly surprised. The coffee shop was busy, yet welcoming. On the front patio they had live music playing while when I walked in the doors there were local artists artwork hung on the walls. Although there was quite the line, everyone in the small shop seemed to know one another, which made me feel right at home.       While I stood in line to place my order, I browsed over the menu and realized how great their food looked. I was pleasantly surprised that while in line, one of the employees came up to me, asking if there was anything they could get started for me. This was refreshing considering most places where you are required to stand in line seem to take forever until any attention is paid to you.  I asked about their coffee and was hooked as soon as they told me they roast their own coffee. I quickly asked for a white chocolate latte and a Rooster Breakfast Burrito while my sister ordered their iced coffee. A couple minutes later I paid. The pricing of the coffee and the cinnamon roll was very affordable in comparison to brand coffee shops.       When I went to sit down when I realized the barista had already made our drinks and it was sitting up at the bar waiting for us. It was extremely well made and topped with a design of a flower drawn into the foam. It wasn't bitter, not too much milk nor foam; it was perfect. The iced coffee on the other hand was the best I had ever had. You could tell the espresso they used to make the coffee was roasted in shop because it was nothing like the bitter stuff you get from Starbucks. The breakfast burrito was out of this world. It was made with eggs, short rib, pepper jack cheese and a chipotle aoli all wrapped into a delicious flour tortilla. The short rib was tender and savory without being too heavy (but yet filling). It was the perfect combination of spicy and savory without being too overpowering. My sister and I spit it and could not help but want another one (although we resisted).      Although everything was very good, the service was exceptional. From the moment I stood in line to ordering to picking up our drinks the people behind the counter treated us as though they had known us our whole lives. They made us feel like it was our own personal coffee shop from start to finish. When we were through enjoying they came and picked up our plates and asked how everything was, it could not be better.      If you are ever in the area and are looking for a great place to grab a quick cup of coffee, hangout for a bit, or grab a bite to eat, this local coffee shop is it. You will not be disappointed with the food, coffee or service.",

It's a really great way for me to wake up on my lazy weekend and get out before it becomes frighteningly hot. My fave is the iced latte. I just love the roasted flavor and how refreshing it is; especially, during the summer desert heat. It tastes so much better than a few other places I've frequented. The cinnamon rolls are also a stand-out. I have no idea how fresh they are, but they seem to be baked fairly recently, probably from a bakery near by. The frosting appears to be cream cheese, which I greatly appreciate. It makes it rich and flavorful without being too sugary. One other thing: they do have free WiFi here. The other \"one other thing\" I'd like to mention is the mutant memory ability of the girl who works behind the counter. Holy *#?@!!! How the heck does she remember my name with my once a week visits???",

Kind of disappointing and it's happened the last 3 times I've called. If you're not an early riser you probably won't be able to get one (I called between 9:45-10:30 AM). Otherwise, they have a really good iced vanilla latte but only when they get it right! Today they didn't put vanilla in any of the 3 vanilla lattes that I ordered, said they had everything bagels over the phone but when I got there they said they only had plain bialys, and overall was just a very poor experience. Not sure I'll be back unless some changes are made.",

Yesterday I had their \"hippie\" salad with tuna on top and it was delicious, homemade, and very fresh. This morning I ordered the \"breadless breakfast\" (they also have an amazing variety of must-try breakfast burritos) which includes eggs, cheese and your choice of a breakfast meat. I also added a side of fruit. Everything has been spectacular- cooked to order, timely, delicious.  The ambiance is perfect here; chill place with many customers coming and going or relaxing with friends. This places possesses a lovely community atmosphere which is so often lacking these days. They can now count me as one more member of the Coffee Roastery community!",

Everywhere I go, I get \"well, no, but we can make a decaf iced Americano\" and it NEVER EVER works out, it just never tastes very good.  So I called ahead since my wife and I are traveling to Phoenix/Scottsdale for vacation to ask about iced decaf and got a YES answer.  So when I got here they were True to their word.  Had one iced decaf and one iced regular and both tasted GREAT.  And the staff were great and I loved the ambiance and the big roaster.  They offer lots of options for beans and styles.

The only real negative about the place isn't even their fault, because no one has found a way to get some of those Scottsdale women from bathing in terrible perfume.

Everything about this coffee shop makes me adore it from the large blue roaster to the local artwork on the walls.   They have a great breakfast menu and snack options for all types of dietary palates. My favorite is their breakfast burrito with only eggs, potatoes, and cheese. It comes with a side of delicious salsa. We always stop here before a road trip to split the burrito.   Before I turned into a cold-brew feign, I used to get their white chocolate latte. It is so creamy and delicious without being overly sweet. My boyfriend's go-to is a small iced latte with a small hint of their vanilla syrup. My dad loves their espresso to sip. My best friend loves the plain hot coffee of the day.   This is also the place I come to when I want to try something new because I know they have such high quality coffee that I will get the full experience out of a new drink.",

In fact, it's only about a half a mile from a doctor's office I go to regularly (and have been for a while) & I'm a little annoyed I forgot about this place the whole time.  Anyway, I stopped in with my mom. I got a delicious caramel latte & some sort of blueberry oat bar, which was YUMMY! The right amount of blueberry to oats, and everything tasted so fresh! I also tasted a piece of my mom's banana bread, and it was great as well.   The staff here is very friendly and it's a really cut set-up. There's a small patio, and a a good amount of tables and chairs inside. In addition, there's a small bar area in the back by the espresso machine with seating. There's also an area up front with couches and cushy chairs around a large table. This is where I sat w/my mom and we randomly struck up a conversation with some friendly people.   I'm glad I rediscovered this place. I'll be back!",

(We're pretty sure you'll like ours better anyway.) Thank you!\"  I'm in a comfy armchair facing the front window as the sun is beginning its slow evening descent, casting deep yellow beams across the small steel coffee table at my feet. A fresh Americano curls wisps of steam through the fading light.  The Americano is my second drink. The first one I ordered would have likely been a challenge most other places, but not here. It was what some coffee \"hipsters\" refer to as a PoMo (Poor Man's Mocha). PoMo = two pumps of mocha, cold brew, a little cream, and ice.  Lucas took my order, but had never heard of a PoMo. He enlisted the help of the barista, Fadi. Fadi had never heard of the drink either, but was more than happy to give it a whirl. No argument from either of these guys. I really appreciated that.  The drink came out really tasty and, as you already know, I ordered up seconds, choosing my go-to coffee this time - an Americano, hot and black. (It is quite tasty as well.)  All storytelling aside, I couldn't be happier with my first visit to Village Coffee. Both Lucas and Fadi were polite, helpful, and attentive. Truly wonderful service from these two. The drinks were good, and fairly priced.  The ambiance is perfect for working with plenty of local art, plenty of space, and even good music (their radio has been playing bands like Foals and The Wombats - right up my alley!). Plenty of seating inside and out.  If you haven't been to visit Village Coffee yet, I would highly recommend it. Just look at their ratings! Tons of reviews and just BARELY shy of 5 stars!? Solid. Come alone or bring a group of friends - there's plenty of room.  I'll definitely be back. I really like this place. A pleasant surprise, to be sure. Thanks Village Coffee, Lucas, and Fadi for making this visit an enjoyable one! Very good work guys. Very well done.  :)",

For starters, they are open from 6-6 which is awesome. Was later in the day when my latte craving hit, and I was happy to find that this place I wanted to try was open past 4!  It was pretty easy to find, right near Butters, one of my favorite breakfast joints. There weren't too many people there when I went, lots of parking and it was low key there which was awesome.  The guy working the counter was cool, didn't make me feel rushed or anything, which sometimes I get due to my indecisiveness and taking way too long to order haha.  I was happy to see all of the options and also the food menu looked good! Healthy stuff and some yummy sounding breakfast burritos. The snacks they had on display looked delish. Also I thought it was great they had options for soy, almond, or coconut milk. That's a wide variety in terms of dairy free milk substitutes! I went with an almond milk latte, and asked about the flavored syrups. Ended up getting pumpkin spice because despite triple digit weather, I want it to be fall. It tasted great, my PSL craving was certainly satisfied. I got mine iced and one thing that was great was that they didn't use too much ice. Always sucks when you get a drink like that and it's 90% ice haha. So the ice to latte ratio was perfect! Next time I come here I definitely have to try a baked good, and bring a coffee or tea lover along to show them this gem!",

    "text": "I have to say, I'm pretty surprised that this place isn't rated a little better. I thoroughly expected it to be a 4 - 5 star place with a ton of reviews. (of course, it is in a fairly sleepy shopping center)  While my experience here has been limited to scattered mornings in which i'm playing hooky from work, I really wish it was closer to home and I could be more of a regular. Their drip coffee is good, and the iced americano i got this morning was great. I can't speak to the rest of their drinks.   Food-wise, I've only ever had the quiche and the occasional cookie... both amazing. I would try a breakfast sandwich, but honestly, I never get past the quiche. It's just always so good. They always have a good selection of flavors (cherry tomatoes and basil, red peppers & feta, spinach, etc.) and they're always delish. The one thing i will say is I wish their menu was a little better explained. Maybe they have printed take-out menus that I haven't seen that offer more explanation, but there's a fair number of \"named\" sandwiches that give you absolutely no clue as to what's on them. And for a guy that's both a) adverse to asking questions, and b) wants to avoid being the guy that holds up the entire line.... this is a hurdle. (also, while everyone I've dealt with is perfectly nice,  for some reason I do always get the feeling that everyone in there is part of one big in-the-know \"clique\" and i'm the visiting outsider. Maybe they just get a super high number of regulars?)  All in all, i'm still perfectly content to jump off the 101 a few stops early every now and again, enjoy a great cup of coffee and a fantastic breakfast, and get a nice start to the day.",

Bagels are above average and hit the spot with the large soup-bowl sized coffee when dining here.   Limited seating though, irregular roasting schedule and irregular availability of beans.  Barrista drinks aren't anything to write home about, and they have very limited hours and parking is often bad.  So it's a hate/love situation for me.  Beans to go, and maybe a drip coffee to go - fine.",

On the down side, the mocha uses chocolate syrup and not chocolate powder, so we gave that a miss. A small Americano equates to an Australian long black, and a latte corresponds to our cappuccino - milk well-textured without excessive froth- though the Village Coffee's soy milk is flavored with vanilla for no apparent reason. The friendly staff got to know our tastes so there was no need to explain our specific requirements each time.   We didn't try the food apart from a muffin, which was nice and chewy. Would have liked to see more choice of cakes, muffins etc, since we didn't want a cooked meal.   It's a great place to hang out and read the paper, though seating is sometimes tight. If ever we return to Scottsdale we shall choose to stay within easy range of this place.",

Village Coffee roast the coffee on the premise and they have some very exotic single origin beans.  Also add free wifi and you have one of the best spots in Scottsdale to drink a great cup of Joe.  If it was sooo good why not 5 stars? Mostly I give out 5 stars for the most perfect place of all time, and that is hard to come by. The main reason for only 4 stars is that I was unable to try the brewed coffee as they had already dumped it out.  The cons are basically some pretty odd art on the wall, and the whole bean coffee is a bit overprices. They also do not have tee shirts, or any logos on the bag of beans, so you don't know what is in the bag or were it came from. The seating is a little limiting also for groups bigger then four.",

No, not the wild exotic mixed coffee concoctions, but just your basic strong coffee that tastes like it was brewed in an old enamel pot on a camp stove.  Although most of the corporate coffee shops have their \"bold\" coffees, they just don't do it.  And throw in some bagels, muffins, pastries and reading material, and I'm good. So I stopped by here with some friends the other day, and was pleasantly surprised.  They do their own roasting and grindings, and have really good flavorful coffee.  They also have pastries, muffins, and minimal  sandwiches.  It is nicely decorated with a few really comfortable chairs on the inside with counter seating and tables.  There is also outside seating that is really pleasant on those warm Arizona mornings.  A plus is that they have free WiFi, and newspapers and magazines for comfortably relaxing over that morning cup of coffee.  Surprisingly, although  I have been back several times, I haven't tried any of their food or pastries. To me, it is all about the coffee, and great doses of caffeine.  For that, they get four stars.  They have the best tasting coffee I have found in the Phoenix area, and although they don't always have their strongest available, I can always find one that I like.  It has now become my morning hangout.",

While located in the fairly swanky Scottsdale Mercado complex, as soon as you open the door you feel like you're in one of those cosmopolitan/bohemian shops in San Francisco, Settle or New York.  I guess that can be an awful thing when the execution feels forced or fake, but the 'vibe' here is authentic, and the quality of the coffee (and diverse menu of espresso drinks) bears out the authenticity of this shop.  I'd also highly recommend the sandwiches, which can range from 3 stars to 4.5 stars (BLT), but lets face it, you're going there for the coffee.  You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "This is the best coffee in town, some of the best coffee anywhere.   The quality starts with the roast, done in-house to perfection. If you've grown up on the bitter, burnt beans of the ubiquitous chains, this coffee will come as a revelation to you. And just as much attention and care is given to the brewing and pulling of shots (of course with filtered water) as to the roasting. The result is smooth, complex ambrosia where the individual characteristics of different beans can shine through.  While the coffee is sublime, there's little snobbery about it at Village. No one will look askance at you if you order an americano, a mocha, or a latte with more flavors than a Baskin-Robbins. But I do recommend trying the espresso straight at least once. You shouldn't miss out on that.  There's a limited food menu - sandwiches, soups, salads, pastries - and they're all fine. But, if you can come in on a Thursday or Friday, you might be able to snag some of the short rib before it's all gobbled by the regulars. That's a whole other level of delicious, rubbed with spices and braised in the shop's delicious espresso.  With some major remodeling just complete, the Roastery is more cosy than ever with an ample patio area and some very cool new architectural details inside.  Good coffee, good food, a comfortable atmosphere, and a cool owner. What more could anyone want?",

The intoxicating aromas (from the roasting) that fill the room will convince you to pay any price for this coffee.  I had the Costa Rica blend today - there's a sign that says - \"if you're on the patio and would like a refill, its .50. If you leave and come back, please pay for another coffee.\" I totally understand because when I finished my 24 ounces, I almost drove back.  I'll be back.",

There is a plethora of baked goods for purchase.  The folks who work here seem to be even more morning types than even I because they're open early.  Another I like is the red-eye which is a shot of espresso and then filled with your choice of roast, one I have yet to try is the black-eye which is two shots of espresso and then fill with your choice of roast.

I have passed by this place many times on my way to work not thinking much of it but read good reviews so decided to go during my lunch. I was a little discouraged with there being no parking and was tempted to leave. I ended up finding a spot in the other side of the shopping center but decided I would make the walk since it wasn't a hot day. I order a iced vanilla latte and it was amazing. It was one of the best I've had in a long, long time. Most of the time coffee shops make it too sweet or add too much milk so you can't taste the espresso. This was balanced perfect. I am looking forward to another cup very soon.",

I was really interested in the 10+ different selections of coffee they have available particularly the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe I saw back there. When I asked for a cup I was informed they only have 2 available in pots by the door and don't do pour overs. Cool, no biggie, I'll take a 16 oz, the Chiapas was nice to see, similarly to the yirgacheffe they have a distinct flavor profile that I love if roasted well. Unfortunately the Chiapas was filled with grinds. Again, understanding of the situation I pivot to the non region specific El Salvador which is cold. Like unbelievably carelessly cold not iced coffee just to be clear. I didn't bother with the decaf they had, poured myself some grind filled Chiapas which is unbelievably overextended at this point and cut my losses. The bummer is I attempted to talk to 2 separate employees about their coffee and no one seemed even the least bit interested. I know my passion for coffee is more than most, but a basic level of understanding about the product you're serving would have been nice. I just feel like there's more than enough independent coffee and fantastic roasters in the area for me to even consider giving us a second shot.",

Lisa, the owner, (the coolest chick in Scottsdale) is committed to putting out the best, and most diverse selection of coffee from around the world, and is truly passionate about her work. She can tell you about every coffee she has in her store, including the notes, flavors, nuances, etc. What more can you ask for?   I'll tell you. Free wi-fi? They have it. Comfy chairs? Got those too. Displays of local artists selling their photography, and art on the wall? Yep. And she picks legitimately talented artists to display in her shop.  Also, for those of us really addicted to her coffee, she'll mail you coffee to WHEREVER you may be, FPO/APO addresses included. Good coffee is a must even in inhospitable environments. ;)   Thanks Lisa for giving me the greatest cup of coffee ever!",

It's a great little place to sit down and surf the web if you have the time. It wasn't a loud place at all like some Starbucks are. I only got a coffee drink, but it was fabulous. The only criticism I would give is that it did not have a drive thru which I'm pretty sure why most Starbucks do so well. Being in Scottsdale, this place I would see in downtown Phoenix if anything.

Then he and a customer sitting nearby told me to come in the morning if I wanted to enjoy the popping  crowd and the wonderful breakfast sandwich.   From there the barista proceeded to tell me about how the owner bought all the equipment from Italy. He began to experiment with coffee beans and decided to buy his own roaster so he could make sure they were nice and mellow in flavor. He was right!   The coffee was nice and mellow. I started with a coffee latte and my other half have a iced tea. She let me know she couldn't drink it as it tasted funny. He got a cup so he could taste it. I brought it back to the barista and he offered to make her a latte if she wanted it. As I was waiting for him to make the group, I asked him how much the scones were sitting in the cake glass. He told me that the owners' wife made them fresh daily. I didn't order one but it sure looked good.   And they have a nice sitting area outside as well as inside.

    "text": "I love a coffee shop that not only serves up great coffee drinks, but also has a good variety of food options, and Village Coffee Roastery does just that!   They have everything from a gut busting breakfast burrito to a lighter breakfast of oatmeal or crustless quiche. You also get a lot of bang for your buck as their portions are large and filling.   The one drawback is that every single time I'm there the employees all seem slightly confused or distracted. You often have to repeat your order a few times or they will get something wrong.   Regardless, it's definitely one of my favorite coffee shops when I need a caffeine fix and something tasty on the side.",

Couple that with a great cup of coffee, pleasant surroundings; what's not to love?   I ordered a cappuccino, 6 ounce in a stay-here cup. Solid espresso taste. Easily a place to hang out, read a book, talk with friends or get some work done. The free wi-fi (you have to obtain the code) seemed to be relatively fast.   There are several tables and plenty of comfy chairs to enjoy your stay. Fascinating wall art for sale, and of course, the roastery equipment just hanging out makes it even more authentic.",

The food and baked goods offered looked nice and they had a lot of tea and coffee options.   But my cafe au lait involved me self serving the drip from a thermos and the counter help steaming and pouring in the milk after the fact. We took our coffee for take away and as I sipped on my beverage en route to We-Ko-Pa golf resort, I just wasn't in love with the taste or quality of the brew. Not quite sure I understand the rave reviews about this place.   But the staff was nice and given the location and ample seating, I guess I can understand its popularity as a good hangout place....if you're looking for the best cup of joe in Scottsdale though, I think there are better options.",

Maybe you'll get lucky and find a parking space right outside but expect a short walk.  Inside the ambience is laid-back hipster. Or maybe work meets casual with a hint of allure. There are two large blue coffee roasters that dominate one side of the coffeehouse. The walls are well covered with interesting artwork.  The coffee is flavorful and the taste of my latte is one of coffee beans then milk so one can experience the rich smooth elixir as it glides down your throat.  People watching here is a pastime you could easily engage in as there are people coming and going all the time.",

They have been around for 20 years and it's obvious why, they are the best! They truly handle their coffee and beans with proper care so no burnt coffee here The food is delicious and their pastries are addicting!  They always have a great music selection and a chill vibe inside and out. It does get busy and energizing at times but still holds its still, calming and peaceful aura.  I love the art for sale on the walls and the community that build here naturally. The staff makes you feel like family and their coffee, cooking and customer care service is on point!   Clean and aroma filled always inspiring the senses.  It's also very nice how they serve meals and treats on plates with utensils rather than just to-go bags.  If you love coffee and have yet to try this roastery- you are missing out",

I had a large coffee, which  I take black, and this coffee was strong, but smooth.  For breakfast we ordered a breakfast burrito w/ sausage, and a croissant sandwich with ham. Both were DELICIOUS, and the portion sizes are larger than we expected, but the quality is what we had come to expect.  It's a great little spot, locally owned, and full of friendly people. Very much worth the ride to get here :).",

I saw several people working on their laptops, and I noticed that the employees were smiling and that there was a variety of breakfast items to choose from as well.

I feel like a lot of the people that say the coffee is weak here are just used to the burnt bitter garbage they get at Starbucks and don't know what real coffee should taste like!    My chai tea was fantastic.  It's probably the best chai I've ever had.  Their menu is pretty limited but if you're looking to just get a really good cup of coffee/cappuccino/latte this is the place to go.  The girl behind the counter was also really nice.  My husband pretty much asked what every single drink on the menu was and she answered all of his questions with a smile, and was happy to give my husband 2% milk for his coffee since he doesn't like half and half or skim which is what they had out.  It's also really nice to support a local business instead of a huge corporation.",

I'm talking about just a regular cup of drip coffee--I don't need anything fancy in the mornings (although, I do enjoy my espresso-based drinks as well, don't get me wrong here).  Well, this place has got it! From light-roasts, to dark-roasts, to decaf, to toddies.  Pros: Local, nice variety of coffees and drinks, upbeat environment, yummy pastries, pretty decent food, nice staff, and quick service  Cons: I'm not a huge fan of their espresso-based drinks (lattes, mochas, etc.), unfortunately. Coffees and pastries (most specifically the blueberry scones) are the highlight of this shop for me.  My recommendation: I usually get a regular drip coffee with a splash of almond milk and a shot of the caramel syrup in my cup. The combo always goes well with the medium-dark roast that they prepare for the day! On a particularly hot day (which is most days in AZ), I'll get the iced-toddy (espresso beans brewed in cold water). I think I might like Cartel Coffee Lab's iced toddy better, but this does the trick!  Also, I think they do make a good iced chai/dirty chai as well. I like them here, and I don't usually prefer chai lattes when I go to coffee shops.  Overall, I wouldn't drive out of my way JUST to try the food/coffee here. But, if you're in the area, Village Coffee Roastery is definitely a great place to stop by to grab a snack and re-fill your coffee cup for the day.",

I had a little trouble with the menu deciding on what to order. So I ask her what would be good or what she would recommend.   I ended up asking her what was similar to a caramel macchiato and she suggested a vanilla hazelnut macchiato. I ordered a large and the price was very related to the venti iced latte from Starbucks but the cup seemed to be smaller than Starbucks.   With all the comparison aside, my iced latte was very good.   Customer service was also very, very, good. I would come back but maybe if Starbucks isn't open. :)",

    "text": "Went there yesterday and the food was okay and they messed up my breakfast sandwich (wrong bagel and wrong meat). Gave it another chance today bc it's so close to my apartment and I REALLY wanted to like it. I definitely regret that decision. Put in an order to go this AM and was quoted with a 20 minute wait to pick it up. Got there a few minutes after the 20 minute mark and ended up waiting another *45* minutes after the 20 they quoted. So it took them over 1 hour to make 2 bfast burritos, a bfast sandwich and eggs/bacon/toast. Not only that - they screwed up all 4 of them. The rooster burritos we got were literally egg and cheese - nothing else. The egg sandwiches had the wrong bagel, wrong meat and no cheese. The other breakfast was missing toast and had ONE slice of soggy bacon. I am so sad bc I had such high hopes for this place. But it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Finally a customer had to say - if you can't make them don't serve them. So they stopped making food after that... I have no idea how this place has such good reviews.",

    "text": "Since arriving in Arizona, I've made a promise to myself to visit a new coffee shop every week I'm search of the best coffee shop experience that Arizona has to offer. This week's stop was Village Coffee Roastery.   The moment I walked in, I felt an indescribable feeling of joy. I don't know what it was exactly that struck me about this place, perhaps it was the roasting contraption right in the front with a handful of comfy chairs around it. Perhaps it was the blue tile half wall surrounding the bar area or the chalk board menu. I'm not sure what it was but I felt at home right away. The barista behind the counter greeted me as if I was a friend, we chatted a bit about the menu, I made a joke about their \"Why Bother\" drink. That's a non fat sugar free vanilla latte to those not in the know. I asked about their For Here mugs and he took the time to go over the sizes of the mugs. I ordered cappuccino and he asked if I like it dry or wet and I was blown away that he asked. THANK YOU! As a matter of fact, I like mine on the drier side. I stood by while he started it and he told me to go have a seat and he'd bring it out to me. What service!     When he presented my drink I geeked out over the foam and he asked if I needed a wifi code. So thoughtful! I sat back and enjoyed. I actually found myself sitting there, smiling to myself. Purely and utterly happy. Here's the kicker. Usually, at a coffee shop, I stick my earbuds in and ignore the world for a while. Not today. Their music selection was so perfect, so wonderful that I didn't bother. I could live at Village Coffee. I was one of 4 customers there and it really felt as if I was sitting in my own private, wonderful piece of heaven.   My experience at Village was so great, I want to take a star away from every other coffee shop I've been to because none if them have compared to this place.",

Friendly staff, eclectic decor, comfy seating spaces, and a great menu.  My go-to here is the dirty chai (drinking one right meow).  They stir up all of the iced latte drinks before they pour them so the consistency is extra creamy.  Most of the food is made in-house, along with their muffins.  Seriously - no better way to be greeted in the morning than by a tray of muffins hot out of the oven.  If you live in the neighborhood, don't forget to sign up for their loyalty program.  For every 10 drinks, you get one free.  You'd be surprised how quickly they accumulate.  Love you guys, keep doing what you're doing!",

I didn't know exactly what I wanted, and the barista was kind enough to work with my mom and me in making out decision. We got 2 small lattes and opted for mugs instead of cups. Because the mugs were smaller, they only charged us for Americanos, which are over $1 cheaper. Customer service for the win!  Our lattes were INCREDIBLE! The espresso was perfectly bold, but not bitter. Definitely one of the best lattes I've ever had.   I'll definitely be back!",

Never been and now a place I must return to. First and foremost, the people working the counter were super friendly and helpful, a nice change from the chain coffee places in my neighborhood. My cappuccino was better than what I normally get at the neighborhood chain coffee houses, and that alone is worth the return trip. Liked the somewhat eclectic vibe of the place with the mismatched chairs and artwork. Has a nice outdoor seating area, that is probably fabulous in our cooler months. Definitely will be back to try out the food and relax with a good cup of coffee.",

Weekday mornings, you might as well find me hooked up to a coffee IV at my desk! But in all seriousness, these baristas sure can make a great coffee... and better than your other big chains.   My go-to is a soy latte - plain and simple. My boyfriend has a more cumbersome order and without fail they always come out piping hot with velvety, delectable foam! Mmm! They have a pretty good selection of baked goods, breakfast burritos and sandwiches.  Customer service is awesome, pretty much like cheers - everyone knows your name (after you've been a patron a few times).   If you live or work in the area, definitely stop by!",
